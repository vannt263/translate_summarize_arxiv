    "geodesic acoustic modes ( gam ) @xcite are finite - frequency components of zonal structures ( zs ) @xcite unique in toroidal plasmas , which could be spontaneously excited by microscopic drift wave ( dw ) type turbulence @xcite , including drift alfvn waves ( daw ) ; and in turn , are capable of scattering dw / daw into stable short radial - wavelength domain @xcite . therefore , gam may regulate the turbulence intensity and the associated wave - induced transports @xcite .",
    "the excitation of gam by dws can be described by parametric decay instability @xcite , where the dwpump @xmath0 decays into a dw lower sideband @xmath1 and a gam @xmath2 , and selection rules of frequency and wavenumber matching conditions are satisfied .",
    "it is known that gam has a finite linear group velocity due to finite ion larmor radius ( filr ) effects , and this linear group velocity is typically radially outward , consistent with gam continuum due to radial temperature profiles . for gam with @xmath3 ,",
    "its linear group velocity is @xmath4 , with the linear dispersion relation given as @xmath5 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the local gam frequency in the fluid limit , @xmath7 the thermal ion velocity , @xmath8 is the major radius of the torus , @xmath9 is the radial wavevector , @xmath10 is the ion larmor radius , and @xmath11 is an order unity coefficient .",
    "this linear group velocity of gam has been discussed in several works @xcite , and is shown to have important consequences on the nonlinear excitation of gam by dws and change the absolute / convective nature of the parametric instability @xcite . radial propagation of gam",
    "has been observed in several experiments @xcite , and qualitative agreement between the experimental results and linear theory has been obtained @xcite . however , in - depth analysis of the experimentally obtained dispersion relation leads to the conclusion that , even though a quadratic dependence of gam frequency on its radial wavevector , qualitatively consistent with linear theory of kgam @xcite , is indeed obtained , the coefficient for filr effects is much larger than that predicted by linear theory @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy has also been found in numerical simulations @xcite , where the measured radial propagation velocity of the dw driven gam is used to determine the coefficients of filr effect , and is found to be much larger than unity . up to now",
    ", there is no first - principle - theory - based explanation of this  enhanced filr effect \" , although a general theoretical framework exists to formulate it with all necessary physics ingredients @xcite .",
    "in fact , we will show in this work , that this discrepancy could be due to nonlinear effects .",
    "we note that , gam is an @xmath12 mode , with @xmath13 sidebands and possibly higher order ones ( depending on the perpendicular wavelength @xcite ) , such that it is generally not driven unstable by expansion free energy of the plasma . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the poloidal and toroidal mode numbers in the fourier mode structure representation adopting straight field line toroidal flux coordinates @xcite .",
    "thus , gam , in general , could be observed when it is nonlinearly driven by ambient turbulence , and in this case , the spatial - temporal evolution of gam is significantly affected by the dw nonlinear drive .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref . that the nonlinearly driven gam propagates at a much larger nonlinearly - coupled group velocity in the presence of dw . as a result , the propagation of gam and experimental observations should also be interpreted taking nonlinear effects into account . in this work",
    ", we shall further study the spatial - temporal evolution of the nonlinearly coupled dw - gam system more in details in order to analyze its implications to experimental observations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the theoretical model used in this work is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , which is then solved in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] for the spationtemporal evolution of the coupled gam - dw system .",
    "the possible applications of our theory to interpretation of experimental observations and numerical results are also presented .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the equations describing the nonlinear interactions between gam and dw are derived using gyrokinetic theory @xcite . assuming that the dw is constituted by a constant - amplitude pump wave and a lower sideband with a much smaller amplitude due to gam modulation , the normalized coupled nonlinear equations describing gam excitation by dw are then given as equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) of ref .",
    ": @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is related with the gam electric field with @xmath18 and @xmath19 an order unity coefficient @xcite , @xmath20 is the perturbed perpendicular pressure due to the dw pump scalar potential @xmath21 in the @xmath22 limit @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the radial envelopes of gam , dw pump and lower sideband , @xmath26 is the normalized pump wave amplitude .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the landau damping rates of dw sideband and gam , @xmath29 is the pump dw frequency and @xmath30 is the diamagnetic drift frequency .",
    "the kinetic term in equation ( [ dwsbequation ] ) , i.e. , the term proportional to @xmath31 , comes from finite radial envelope variation due to the coupling between neighboring poloidal harmonics .",
    "the expression for @xmath31 can be derived from equation ( 19 ) of ref . , and one has @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the safety factor , @xmath34 its radial derivative and @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand , the kinetic term in equation ( [ gamequation ] ) ; i.e. , the term proportional to @xmath11 , comes from filr of gam .",
    "thus , @xmath36 and its detailed expression can be obtained from equation ( 9 ) of ref .",
    "other notations are standard .",
    "we note that , the governing equations ( [ dwsbequation ] ) and ( [ gamequation ] ) are derived from quasi - neutrality condition assuming both gam and dw are predominantly electrostatic perturbations .",
    "electrons respond adiabaticly to @xmath37 perturbations , i.e. , dw and @xmath38 poloidal sidebands of gam ; while ion responses are solved assuming @xmath39 , @xmath22 and @xmath40 for dw .",
    "we note that , even though turbulence usually refers to a broad spectrum of nonlinearly interacting dws , in the present analysis we have considered the nonlinear interactions of gam with a single-@xmath15 dw in order to elucidate the nonlinear effects on the radial propagation of gam due to interaction with finite - amplitude dws . since for each dw with toroidal mode number @xmath15 , the interactions with the corresponding gam is coherent , we may expect that in the presence of dw turbulence consisting of multiple-@xmath15 modes , the net nonlinear effects would be an appropriate sum / integral of the nonlinear effects of individual-@xmath15 mode sconsidered here .",
    "system nonuniformities in equations ( [ dwsbequation ] ) and ( [ gamequation ] ) , which may affect qualitatively the convective / absolute nature of the parametric process as shown in ref . , are also ignored here in order to focus on the radial propagation of the parametrically excited gam pulse .",
    "equations ( [ dwsbequation ] ) and ( [ gamequation ] ) can be solved using two - spatial two - temporal scales expansion of @xmath41 and @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 denoting the slow temporal and spatial variations . in order to delineate the physics of gam propagation",
    ", we can assume that the system is well above the excitation threshold @xcite .",
    "thus , we can ignore @xmath27 and @xmath28 in equations ( [ dwsbequation ] ) and ( [ gamequation ] ) ; and the coupled nonlinear equations reduce to @xmath48 here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the linear group velocities of dw sideband and gam .",
    "we note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 have the same sign for typical tokamak parameters @xcite , such that the excitation of gam by dws is a convective amplification process , ignoring system nonuniformities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in deriving equations ( [ dwsbreduced ] ) and ( [ gamreduced ] ) , the following frequency and wavenumber matching conditions for resonant decay are applied @xmath53 from where @xmath54 can be solved for .    moving into the wave frame by taking @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , the coupled nonlinear equations ,",
    "( [ dwsbreduced ] ) and ( [ gamreduced ] ) , can be combined to yield the following equation describing the nonlinear spatialtemporal evolution of the parametrically excited gam @xmath57 here , @xmath58 .",
    "letting @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , equation ( [ gamequation1 ] ) reduces to @xmath61 physically , @xmath62 can be interpreted as nonlinear modification to the gam wave vector , which also affects the gam frequency as shown below .",
    "equation ( [ gamequation2 ] ) can be solved , and yields the following unstable solution @xmath63.\\label{generalsolution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this solution corresponds to the initial condition @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "we note that this is the typical wave packet initial structure for parametrically excited gam , with a spectrum width @xmath66 . assuming @xmath67 , i.e. , convective damping due to filr effects are higher order corrections to the temporal growth @xcite , the general solution , equation ( [ generalsolution ] ) ,",
    "can then be reduced to the following time asymptotic solution : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 , and it corresponds to gam initial pulse broadening in time .",
    "the time asymptotic solution of gam electric field is then @xmath70    one then readily has from equation ( [ asymptoticsolution ] ) that the nonlinearly excited gam is characterized by a nonlinear radial wavevector @xmath71 i.e. , the wavevector increases with pump dw amplitude , and is larger than that predicted from frequency / wavenumber matching conditions .",
    "the real frequency of the excited gam can also be obtained from equation ( [ asymptoticsolution ] ) @xmath72 @xmath73 can be solved from the matching conditions , which can then be substituted into equation ( [ nonlinearfrequency ] ) , and yield : @xmath74 this is the nonlinear dispersion relation of the parametrically excited gam .",
    "we note that , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are proportional to @xmath77 , and thus , the nonlinear frequency shift due to the modulation of dw , @xmath78 , is independent of @xmath77 .",
    "thus , finite amplitude dw will increase the frequency of the nonlinearly driven gam .",
    "the frequency increment , can be expressed as @xmath79 from our theory , which indicates an order of unity frequency increment for typical tokamak parameters .",
    "this may explain the existence of the higher frequency branch of the  dual - gam \" observed in ht-7 tokamak @xcite , which oscillates at a frequency much higher than other branch with the usual gam frequency ( the frequencies of the two co - existing  dual - gams \" are respectively 12 and 21 khz in shot 113901 @xcite ) .",
    "another finding of the ht-7 experiment is the coefficient of filr effect is @xmath80 larger than that predicted by linear theory @xcite . on the other hand , equation ( [ nonlineardr ] )",
    "shows that the coefficient for kinetic dispersiveness is , in fact , decreased by a factor @xmath81 .",
    "the reason why experimental analysis found an  increased \" coefficient is that , in the analysis of experimental data , one employed the linear dispersion relation of gam and used the expression @xmath82 to determine the coefficient @xmath11 @xcite . here , the subscript @xmath83 denotes experimental observation , and @xmath84 denotes local continuum frequency of gam . as we have shown in equation ( [ nonlineardr ] ) , ",
    "@xmath85 \" contains the kinetic dispersiveness as well as the order one nonlinear frequency increment @xmath78 ; which , thus , can lead to an over - estimation of the coefficient @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the effective coefficient obtained in this way is , @xmath87 for typical tokamak parameters ; which is significantly larger than that predicted by linear theory . our nonlinear theory ,",
    "thus , provides a possible explanation of experimental observations .",
    "it can also be used to explain the @xmath80 increase of the filr coefficient from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the coupled gam and dw sideband wavepacket , propagates at a nonlinear group velocity @xmath56 , which is much larger than the linear group velocity of gam due to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 for resonant decay ) .",
    "thus , to interpret the propagation of gam nonlinearly excited by dw turbulences including daw , linear theory of kgam @xcite is not adequate , and one must instead , apply nonlinear theory .",
    "we note also that , while both the real frequency and wavevector of the excited gam depend on the amplitude of the pump dw , the nonlinear group velocity is determined by @xmath77 from matching conditions , and is independent of the pump amplitude . thus ,",
    "for the comparison of experimentally observations with analytical theory , the nonlinear group velocity may be a better candidate .",
    "the coupled nonlinear gam and dw sideband equations , equations ( [ dwsbequation ] ) and ( [ gamequation ] ) , are solved numerically . here , we fix @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and study the coupled nonlinear equations by varying @xmath93 . the dependence of the nonlinear wavenumber @xmath9 on pump amplitude is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinearkr ] , where the dots are the wavenumbers from numerical solution , the diamonds are the wavenumbers obtained from equation ( [ nonlinearwavevector ] ) ; and the solid curve is obtained from matching condition .",
    "for the parameters we have here , the wavevector solved from matching conditions is @xmath94 .",
    "we may see from fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinearkr ] that our nonlinear theory fits well with the numerical results ; and it reduces to @xmath77 as @xmath93 approaches 0 .",
    "the comparison of the numerically measured nonlinear group velocity with our theory , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinearvg ] , where the dots are numerical results and the diamonds are obtained from @xmath56 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are defined with @xmath77 .",
    "we note that , for the parameters we used in numerical solution , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "very good agreement between numerical results and analytical theory ( @xmath98 discrepency ) are obtained here , suggesting that experimentally observed radial propagation of gam must be understood using nonlinear theory .     v.s .",

    "pump amplitude @xmath93 , width=340 ]     v.s .",

    "[ fig : nonlinearfrequency ] , where the dots are numerical results and the diamonds represents @xmath99 from equation ( [ nonlinearfrequency ] ) .",
    "note that , for the parameters we use here , @xmath100 , and the nonlinear frequency from numerical solution increases with pump dw amplitude as predicted by our theory .",
    "in conclusion , equations describing the spatialtemporal evolution of parametrically excited gam initial pulse are studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "it is found that the parametrically excited gam propagates at a nonlinear group velocity , which is the mean of the linear group velocities of gam and dw , and is much larger than that predicted by linear theory of kinetic gam .",
    "the wavevector of the excited gam has a quadratic dependence on the amplitude of the constant - amplitude pump dw . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonlinear group velocity is independent of the pump dw amplitude ; suggesting it as a good candidate for the comparison between experiments and analytical theory .",
    "our nonlinear theory , further shows that there is a nonlinear upshift in the gam frequency .",
    "implications of the present theoretical findings to the ht-7 experimental observations are also important .",
    "our results demonstrate that one must include nonlinear effects in order to properly analyze numerical simulations and/or experimental observations of gam .",
    "we note that , while the ambient turbulence in experiments consists of a whole spectrum of nonlinearly interacting dws , we have , in the present analysis , considered the modification of the gam dispersion relation due to a single-@xmath15 dw with finite amplitude .",
    "this can be justified , since dw interactions with zs , e.g. gams , have two components : a coherent part due to the interaction with the self - generated zs , and a random contribution due to interaction with zs produced by other incoherent components of the fluctuation spectrum @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the coupling coefficient is proportional to dw intensity and , therefore , we focus here on the coherent gam - dw interaction @xcite .",
    "effects of system nonuniformities , which are shown to play important roles on the nonlinear interactions between gam and dws are also ignored here .",
    "this will limit the applications of our nonlinear theory . to properly interprete global numerical simulations and/or experimental results , more in - depth investigations taking into account system nonunifomities",
