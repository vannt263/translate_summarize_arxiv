    "the delta - sigma experiment research program @xcite intends to obtain a complete @xmath5 data set at the zero angle : the measurements of total cross section differences @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the longitudinal ( @xmath8 ) or transverse ( @xmath9 ) beam and target polarizations and spin - correlation parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite as well as unpolarized measurements of values @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "the main task of these studies is to determine the _ re _ and _ i m _ parts of @xmath5 amplitudes over the energy region 1.23.7gev .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath6 @xcite shows an anomalous decrease to zero above 1.2gev and the structure in @xmath14 around 1.8gev @xcite predicted in @xcite . for the exhaustive analysis of this structure",
    "it is necessary to build the argand diagrams for the _ re _ and _ i m _ parts of each of the three @xmath15 forward scattering amplitudes . to reduce the sign ambiguities the delta - sigma collaboration measured the ratio @xmath16 for the charge exchange quasi - elastic and elastic processes at @xmath17 using the d@xmath18 and h@xmath18 targets .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath0 could provide additional constraint and will allow one of some sign uncertainties to be eliminated for the direct reconstruction of the _ re _ parts of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath0 value at zero angle defines the ratio @xmath19 of the non - flip to flip contributions in the @xmath1 charge exchange process .",
    "this possibility is based on the deuteron properties that the deuteron is the amplitude filter at small momentum transfer in the @xmath20 reaction , and the non - flip part vanishes due to the pauli principle for two slow neutrons . therefore , the quasi - elastic @xmath21 differential cross section is the flip yield of the @xmath1 charge exchange process .",
    "it is expressed by the dean formula @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 elastic reaction can be represented by two approaches : either as the charge exchange @xmath1 reaction to the @xmath22 angle ( @xmath23 ) or as the neutron elastic scattering @xmath2 in the inverted direction to the @xmath24 angle .",
    "though both representations have equivalent differential cross sections , their flip or non - flip parts are absolutely different @xcite .",
    "the main cause for this distinction will be shown in section 3 . to compare the energy dependencies of experimental @xmath0 or estimated @xmath19 with the psa solutions of @xmath5 elastic scattering",
    ", we should use the true charge exchange amplitudes , which requires the unitary transition from the @xmath25 to the @xmath26 elastic representation .",
    "the observable @xmath0 is the ratio of the quasi - elastic @xmath27 differential cross section to the free @xmath1 charge exchange one ( also named as @xmath28 ) @xmath29 following the theory in @xcite , where the duration of @xmath21 collision is much smaller than the characteristic motion period of deuteron nucleons , the @xmath27 quasi - elastic reaction can be expressed within the framework of impulse approximation by the dean formula @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the deuteron form - factor which equals one for the forward direction , and when the scattering angle @xmath22 approaches zero , the first term on the right - hand of ( [ dean ] ) vanishes @xmath32 note that this simplification is not possible if we take the elastic backward reaction @xmath2 instead of the charge exchange forward one , because if the difference of masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 is neglecting , the four - momentum transfer @xmath35 will be defined as @xmath36 and the form - factor @xmath31 will not equal to one .",
    "the similar replacement could be justified if both @xmath5-elastic scattering representations ( @xmath2 backward or @xmath1 forward ) are absolutely identical together with their flip and non - flip parts . however",
    ", this hypothesis is not valid , as will be shown in the next section ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover according to the source @xcite the formula ( [ dean ] ) is defined using the representation of the charge exchange process as a  generalization of the result found originally for @xmath37 by lee @xcite \" .",
    "the author of this work told also that :  for the non - charge - exchange reaction , however , no such simple result follows \" .    for @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "we have @xmath40 thus , the deuteron as an amplitude filter can be used in the measurement of @xmath0 for defining the flip and non - flip parts of the @xmath1 process , i.e. for observing spin effects in the @xmath5 interaction even without the beam and target polarizations .",
    "within the framework of isotopic invariance the nucleon - nucleon scattering matrix is @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the isotopic pauli operators of nucleons , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the unit vectors of the initial and final relative momenta and the matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 describe the @xmath15 scattering for the isotopic spin @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 elastic reactions at the same angle @xmath22 it can be written @xmath50 with the pauli spin operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 the scattering matrix @xmath53 can be expressed in the goldberger ",
    "watson amplitude representation @xcite @xmath54 here @xmath55 are the complex functions of the interacting particle energy and the variable @xmath56 , the index @xmath57 equals the value of the isotopic spin , and the basic vectors are defined as @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the goldberger ",
    "watson formalism is very suitable for the separation of elastic scattering into the flip and non - flip parts because the amplitude @xmath61 does not have operator term and it is non - flip by definition @xmath62 the wolfenstein formalism in @xcite defined as @xmath63 .",
    "therefore the wolfenstein @xmath64 basic is left - hand in comparison with the goldberger - watson definition : @xmath65 .",
    "however the signs of amplitudes will not change by the means of bilinear form of operator @xmath66 .",
    "hereinafter we shall use the right - hand @xmath67 basis only . ]",
    "@xcite allows dividing the matrix @xmath53 into the spin - singlet and spin - triplet parts using the spin projection operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70\\,\\hat{t}\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath71 is the spin - singlet amplitude and the others are the spin - triplet amplitudes",
    ". both matrix representations ( [ goldberger - watson ] ) and ( [ wolfenstein ] ) are related by the linear transitions @xmath72 let us to quote the works @xcite :  the requirement of antisymmetry of the final wave function @xmath73 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the spin and isotopic functions of the initial state ) relative to the total permutation , including the permutation of the vector ( @xmath76 ) , permutation of the spin and isotopic variables does not change the signs of the amplitudes @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 after the turn @xmath82 , but the amplitudes @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 become inverse \" .",
    "it is accepted as the symmetry properties of these amplitudes ( table  1 )    .symmetry properties of the wolfenstein amplitudes [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "* the final @xcite and preliminary ( at 1,7gev ) experimental results of defining 8 points of the ratio @xmath0 at the zero angle at energies t@xmath882.0gev are presented ( see table  2 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "the existing world experimental data at lower energy agree with our points . * with formula",
    "( [ rdp&nfl / fl ] ) , the values of @xmath89 are calculated for the charge exchange process @xmath90 ( see table  2 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the non - flip part is not zero and equals @xmath91% of the differential cross section . * the unitary transition from the @xmath2 elastic backward reaction to the charge exchange",
    "@xmath1 forward process is considered and the psa curves of @xmath92 and @xmath89 calculated by this approach describe the experimental points well ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 ) .",
