    "in recent years , quantum communication protocols have been extended to the domain of continuous variable ( cv ) systems , i.e. , quantum systems , like the bosonic modes of the radiation field , which are characterized by infinite dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been understood how a sender ( alice ) can exploit bosonic modes in order to send analog signals to a receiver ( bob ) and then extract a secret binary key from these signals @xcite . beyond the possibility of such a continuous variable quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , here",
    "we show how to use these systems in order to perform a ( quasi)confidential quantum direct communication ( qdc ) @xcite , i.e. , the ( quasi)private communication of a message from alice to bob which is directly encoded in cv systems .",

    "however , in general , this is not the case and the honest users must randomly switch their confidential communication with real - time checks on the channel .",
    "as soon as they detect the presence of a non - tolerable noise , they promptly stop the communication .",
    "the maximum noise that can be tolerated is connected to the maximum amount of information that they are willing to give up to an eavesdropper . in other words ,",
    "a good qdc protocol should enable alice and bob to communicate all the message when the noise is suitably low , while losing a small amount of information when it is not .",

    "it makes the protocol fragile to eavesdropping since eve can optimize her attack to the structure of the lattice , e.g. , by using non - universal quantum cloning machines .",

    "such a probability decreases for increasing @xmath18 . an alternative way for decreasing @xmath116 consists of leaving @xmath18 unchanged while introducing a classical error correcting code .",

    "by contrast , in actual qkdprotocols , such an attack can be revealed only after the generation of the encryption key @xmath177 ( to be used in the private comparison of @xmath176 ) .",
    "this clearly requires the distribution and detection of many quantum states ( ideally infinite ) and , therefore , the useless manipulation of a huge amount of quantum resources ( especially when entity authentication is mutual ) . in general , since our qdc scheme adopts the same quantum hardware as standard coherent state qkd , one can also consider random switching between qdc ( for authentication ) and qkd ( for key generation ) .    as a final remark notice that our security analysis concerns the case of individual attacks ( where eve does not exploit any quantum memory ) .",
    "in future work it would be interesting to investigate the performance of the protocol in the presence of collective attacks , where eve exploits a quantum memory to store all her output probes and performs an optimal coherent measurement",
    ". it would be also interesting to extend the security analysis to other forms of gaussian interactions ( i.e. , not referable to a ugqcm ) and even to non - gaussian interactions , that may play a role against the usage of repetition codes .",
