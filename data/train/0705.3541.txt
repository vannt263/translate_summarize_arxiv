    "quantum electrodynamics in d+1 spacetime dimensions ( qed@xmath7 ) with @xmath8 are useful field - theoretic models in high - energy physics .",
    "phenomena like chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are easier to understand in qed@xmath9 and qed@xmath10 than in qcd .",
    "the simplest , exactly solvable model of this type is spinor quantum electrodynamics in @xmath11 spacetime dimensions ( qed@xmath9 ) , the so - called schwinger model , which exhibits both chiral symmetry breaking and confinement.@xcite another example , relevant to the present paper , is the @xmath0-dimensional spinor quantum electrodynamics , qed@xmath10 , in the form introduced by pisarski some time ago.@xcite this model is known to exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.@xcite an interesting aspect of this model is its applicability to condensed matter physics where it appears in different contexts , especially in the study of high-@xmath12 superconductors and mott insulators.@xcite in the study of mott insulators , it arises as an effective theory of the so - called _ spin liquids _ , which are mott insulators without any broken symmetry . in this case",
    "the dirac fermions represent the so - called _ spinons _ , soliton - like excitations carrying spin degrees of freedom but no charge .",
    "a good name for this type of qed is _ quantum spinodynamics _ ( qsd ) , since it is actually a quantum field theory of spinons .",
    "the theory can be derived for mott insulators , and it is found that the abelian gauge field coupling to the spinons is compact .",
    "this follows immediately by accounting for the fluctuations around mean - field theories of resonating valence bonds ( rvb)@xcite states which have a local u(1 ) gauge freedom in which the phase angle is defined only modulo @xmath13 .",
    "these mean - field theories are derived from the strong - coupling limit of the hubbard model , the so - called heisenberg - hubbard model : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are spin-@xmath16 operators formed from fermi fields @xmath17 subjected to the local constraint @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the pauli matrices @xmath21 ( throughout this paper summation over repeated greek indices is implied ) .",
    "the sum in ( [ @hei ] ) runs over nearest neighbor pairs of sites in a square lattice , and @xmath22 is related to the original parameters of hopping and interaction energies @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the hubbard model by @xmath25 .",
    "different composite - field theories are known to represent the same quantum states of the model .",
    "this follows from the fact that the _ local _ gauge symmetry of the heisenberg - hubbard model is actually su(2).@xcite thus , the composite link fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 are nearest neighbors , which are obtained from different hubbard - stratonovich decouplings of the heisenberg - hubbard model , describe the _ same _ physics when associated with the most stable ground state of the corresponding mean - field theory .",
    "they are connected through a su(2 ) gauge transformation.@xcite    the phase fluctuations of either composite field features a lattice gauge field @xmath29 .",
    "these are obviously of the compact u(1 ) type . both fields together",
    "transform into each other by local su(2 ) transformations , and theories utilizing this symmetry have been studied in the past,@xcite with some advantages over compact u(1 ) theories , especially if one is interested in studying the phase structure of high-@xmath12 superconductors.@xcite a local su(2 ) gauge theory also emerges in the study of frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets.@xcite the existence of the larger su(2 ) symmetry ensures the compactness of the abelian theories even in the continuum limit , since the u(1 ) group is a subgroup of su(2).@xcite    a controlled study of u(1 ) spin liquids was initiated some time ago by affleck and marston@xcite using the composite field ( [ am - op ] ) . to have a small expansion parameter",
    ", they generalized the _",
    "global _ symmetry su(2 ) to su(n ) and solved the model in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "this was done in the so - called self - conjugate representation of su(n),@xcite where the spin operators are given by @xmath30 and fulfill the local constraint @xmath31 .",
    "these operators have zero trace : @xmath32 .",
    "if the partition function is represented as a functional integral over the action associated with the hamiltonian ( [ @hei ] ) we may calculate a mean - field approximation from the saddle point approximation .",
    "the result which preserves all the lattice symmetries is the so - called @xmath33-flux phase,@xcite whose spectrum of elementary excitations is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean - field amplitude of @xmath36 .",
    "the excitations around the fermi points @xmath37 can be at low energies represented as four - component dirac fermions .",
    "the phases of @xmath36 fluctuate strongly and form a link gauge field @xmath29 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the effective low - energy lagrangian in imaginary time has the form@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and we have used the usual feynman slash notation @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being @xmath42 @xmath43 matrices . in the above continuum notation the compactness of the gauge field is not apparent .",
    "as it stands , the above lagrangian is just the above - mentioned massless qed@xmath44 , which is a well studied model .",
    "we shall reserve the abreviation qsd for the compact version of @xmath45@xmath44 , whose field theory will be discussed at lenght in sect .",
    "iii .    in qsd",
    "the spinons play a role similar to quarks in qcd .",
    "indeed , compactness of the gauge field leads to spinon confinement if @xmath1 is not large enough.@xcite note , however , an important difference .",
    "in qcd the gluon is introduced ad hoc to generate the coupling between the quarks .",
    "the `` gluon '' in qsd , on the other hand , has a clear origin : it is spontaneously generated by the phase fluctuations of the link field ( [ am - op ] ) , which in turn is a composite field made of lattice fermions .",
    "this unique feature of qsd led wen@xcite to propose a similar mechanism in 3 + 1 dimensions to explain the origin of gauge bosons .",
    "whether spinons in qsd deconfine or not was for some time matter of controversy .",
    "@xcite the controversy seems now to be solved,@xcite at least at a qualitative level .",
    "the result is that spinons deconfine for large enough @xmath1,@xcite and this guarantees the stability of the large-@xmath1 spin liquid .",
    "the aim of this paper is to further improve our understanding of spinon deconfinement , in particular by a more quantitative analysis based on the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "we start in sect .",
    "ii with a discussion of the model in the absence of matter , which just corresponds to the compact version of maxwell electrodynamics in @xmath46 dimensions ( @xmath47@xmath44).@xcite the equivalence of this model with a three - dimensional coulomb gas of instantons allows us to make a relatively simple field theoretical analysis , based on the equivalence of a a coulomb gas with the sine - gordon theory . in sect .",
    "ii we compute the one - loop effective potential of the model in terms of a scalar field @xmath48 whose correlation function @xmath49 gives a direct measure of the interaction between instantons in three - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the calculation of the effective potential leads to an estimate of the instanton mass ( which is different from the mass of the scalar field ) .",
    "we also derive the rg equations for the model . the reulting effective potential and the rg equations confirm in a physically appealing way the well - known result@xcite that in absence of matter the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional compact gauge theory permanently confine test charges .",
    "this result contrasts with the one in 3 + 1 dimensions , where a deconfined phase has been proven to exist.@xcite    section iii is where we start with the analysis of compact qed@xmath44 or qsd .",
    "here is very difficult to write a field theory in terms of the original variables .",
    "it will be necessary , just like in sect .",
    "ii , to work with a field theory describing the dynamics of the instantons .",
    "we still have a gas of instantons , but it is no longer of the coulomb type , since the interaction between the instantons is modified by the vacuum polarization .",
    "the rg equations are obtained in essentially the same way as in sect .",
    "ii , except that the effects of the vacuum polarization are taken into account . these change the phase structure of the theory in an essential way . by considering a theory with @xmath1 replica of dirac fermions ,",
    "we show that spinons deconfine for @xmath2 .",
    "this is a considerable numerical change with respect with our previous calculation of @xmath3,@xcite where a value smaller by a factor @xmath50 was found due to a wrong counting of @xmath33 factors in the rg calculation .",
    "apart from this mistake , the analysis in ref . is correct , in the sense that a critical value of @xmath1 is predicted above which deconfinement occurs .",
    "here we elaborate further the nature of the confined phase .",
    "in particular we show that confinement is the only possibility for @xmath5 while deconfinement certainly occurs only for @xmath51 . in the region @xmath4 either phase",
    "is possible , depending on the instanton density .",
    "the universal properties of qsd are encoded in the coefficient of the @xmath52 contribution to the interspinon potential . in the deconfined phase this coefficient",
    "is given by the fixed point in the renormalization flow derived in the @xmath53 expansion .",
    "however , in the confined phase the @xmath53 expansion does not hold and an expansion in the fugacity is made instead .",
    "spinon deconfinement implies the stability of the spin liquid .",
    "the experimentally relevant case is the @xmath6 one , which corresponds to the regime where the spin liquid is unstable , since the spinons are confined in this case .",
    "the nature of the confined phase for @xmath6 is discussed in sect .",
    "iv , where the important role played by chiral symmetry breaking is emphasized .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional compact electrodynamics studied by polyakov,@xcite abreviated here as @xmath54 , is actually maxwell theory in @xmath46 dimensions in which the gauge group u(1 ) is made compact .",
    "the model was originally motivated by the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern of the georgi - glashow model in @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the su(2 ) group one is left with a residual u(1 ) group which is compact , since it is a subgroup of su(2 ) .",
    "another place where this theory arises naturally is in lattice gauge theory.@xcite    it is well known that @xmath54 is equivalent via duality to a three - dimensional coulomb gas of instantons,@xcite whose energy interaction is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the bare gauge coupling and @xmath57 with @xmath58 are the instanton charges .    in two dimensions",
    "the coulomb gas corresponds to a theory dual to the two - dimensional xy model @xcite or , equivalently , a two - dimensional classical superfluid.@xcite the coulomb interaction between the charges is in this case proportional to @xmath59 . in the context of two - dimensional superfluids ,",
    "the charges in the coulomb gas are interpreted as vortices in two dimensions .",
    "the two - dimensional coulomb gas is known to undergo a vortex - antivortex pair unbiding phase transition , the cellebrated kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition.@xcite in the language of the coulomb gas we have a low - temperature dielectric phase separated from the high - temperature `` metallic '' plasma phase by a phase transition without breaking the u(1 ) symmetry of the original superfluid or xy system , in agreement with the mermin - wagner theorem.@xcite in three dimensions , on the other hand , no phase transition occurs in the coulomb gas and the system remains in the plasma phase . in this case the debye - hckel ( dh ) mean - field theory is essentially correct and the interaction is screened in such a way that the excitations are always gapped .",
    "this can be conveniently expressed in field theory language by means of the sine - gordon representation of the coulomb gas . in the context of @xmath54",
    "the corresponding sine - gordon theory reads @xmath60 the above lagrangian corresponds to the field theory model dual to @xmath54 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is the bare fugacity of the coulomb gas .",
    "the dh theory amounts to a gaussian approximation to the above lagrangian .",
    "this leads to a mass @xmath62 for the scalar field @xmath63 .",
    "this behavior of the dual model implies a corresponding mass gap in the magnetic field correlation function.@xcite fluctuation corrections to the dh approximation essentially do not change this result . to see this , let us compute the one - loop effective potential .",
    "this can be easily obtained by standard methods.@xcite at one - loop order it is more easily obtained by writing @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a constant background field while @xmath66 represents a small fluctuation around it . by integrating out the gaussian fluctuations , the one - loop effective potential is obtained : @xmath67^{3/2},\\ ] ] where a counterterm proportional to @xmath68 was used to trivially subtract the contribution @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being an ultraviolet cutoff . as with eq .",
    "( [ sg ] ) , the obtained effective potential implies a degenerate vacuum at @xmath71 , @xmath72 , whose energy density is given by @xmath73 , which is always negative , just as the energy of the vacuum without the quantum corrections . from this",
    "we conclude that the instantons of this theory are always massive .    in order to better understand the meaning of this statement ,",
    "let us compare the above effective potential with the one of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional sine - gordon theory . in this case",

    "the result is @xmath78.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ground state energy density is now @xmath79 .",
    "this changes sign at @xmath80 , precisely at the critical kt stiffness value.@xcite in this case we can use the results of ref . to obtain the soliton mass as @xmath81 for @xmath82 , which corresponds to low temperatures in the kt theory , the soliton mass vanishes while the energy becomes positive .",
    "for @xmath83 , on the other hand , we can write @xmath84 note that while the soliton mass vanishes at @xmath85 , the scalar field mass does not . this is very important , since in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case the mass of the scalar field also does not vanish for any @xmath86 , but there the same is true of the mass of instanton excitations . by analogy to eq .",

    "( [ msol - e0 ] ) .",
    "the above results are made more transparent when we consider the rg equations of @xmath89 , which are equivalent to the rg equations of the three - dimensional coulomb gas .",
    "to lowest order this may be achieved by means of a scale - dependent dh approximation , in the same spirit of the analysis of the two - dimensional coulomb gas made by young.@xcite the rg equations for the three - dimensional coulomb gas were originally derived by kosterlitz,@xcite using the so - called poor - man scaling approach .",
    "as shall we see , for our purpose it is better to use young s approach,@xcite which we generalize to the higher - dimensional case .",
    "the derivation is given in appendix a for the case of a @xmath90-dimensional coulomb gas .",
    "again , it will be useful to compare the rg equations for the kt case with those for @xmath54 .",
    "setting @xmath91 in eqs .",

    "( [ kt - y ] ) is negative , such that the system will flow to a regime of zero fugacity , leading to a line of fixed points . at this line",

    "( [ flow - msol ] ) corresponds precisely to the kt critical point . in this equation",
    "it should be understood that for @xmath97 and @xmath82 its right - hand side vanishes , since @xmath98 is zero for all @xmath99 and @xmath82 .",
    "now let us see what happens in @xmath89 .",
    "in this case we set @xmath100 in the equations of appendix a , where @xmath101 is a short - distance cutoff , and define the dimensionless gauge coupling @xmath102 , such that @xmath103 with @xmath104 being a logarithmic length scale .",
    "thus , @xmath105 is just given by the screening constant ( `` dielectric '' constant ) of the coulomb gas of instantons . in this way we obtain from eqs .",

    "( [ betay - polyakov ] ) is different from the one obtained by us in ref . , where factors of @xmath33 were overcounted .",
    "it is easy to see that , in contrast with eqs .",
    "( [ kt - k ] ) and ( [ kt - y ] ) , the rg flow pattern does not exhibit any fixed point , giving a further confirmation that the three - dimensional sine - gordon model does not undergo any phase transition .",
    "in other words , the excitations are always gapped .",
    "when fermionic matter is present , the energy of the instanton gas ( [ moninterac ] ) is changed due to the vacuum polarization .",
    "the effective bare gauge coupling is modified to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the wave function renormalization of the gauge field in the noncompact theory .",

    "we see that there is a manifest duality between `` electric '' and instanton charges even after the vacuum polarization is included . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ bare - u-1 ] ) the effective squared instanton charge is given by @xmath116 , thus verifying the dirac duality relation @xmath117 between the effective charges .",
    "at one - loop order we have @xmath118 , implying that at large distances the potential becomes @xmath119 instead of having the logarithmic behavior expected classically .",
    "thus , quantum fluctuations lead in two spatial dimensions to a large distance behavior of the potential similar to the one of electrodynamics in three spatial dimensions .",
    "interestingly , the above power is @xmath120 for all dimensions @xmath121 and the coefficient in front of the factor @xmath120 is universal,@xcite a situation similar to the one obtained from string models for the interquark potential.@xcite    since the energy of the instanton gas is changed by the presence of matter , the sine - gordon theory ( [ sg ] ) must be changed correspondingly.@xcite it is easy to see that the field theory of the instanton gas is now given by @xmath122 where the symbol @xmath123 has an operator meaning such that in momentum space the gradient energy reads simply @xmath124 .",

    "this leads to @xmath138 signaling a `` dielectric '' phase for the instanton gas .",

    "the large distance limit was being taken at a too early stage .",
    "we may argue that if one has a logarithmic gas of instantons in 3d it should not be particularly surprising that a 3d kt - like transition emerges .",

    "the string tension has precisely the same form as in the @xmath54,@xcite except that the bare parameters are replaced by the renormalized ones .",
    "thus , @xmath190 , or in terms of dimensionless quantities , @xmath191 . the term @xmath192 is assumed to be given by a string model for the electric flux tube due to lscher,@xcite which in @xmath90 dimensions has the form @xmath193 such a term has to be included in order to account for the fluctuations of the electric flux tube occuring even in absence of matter .",
    "the factor @xmath194 represents the number of transverse modes of the string worldsheet .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath120 terms in eq .",
    "( [ v+- ] ) are universal and the string tensions @xmath189 reduce to the one obtained by polyakov@xcite in the limit case where no matter fields are present .    the schematic flow diagram for @xmath185 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this case",
    "the system can be either in the confinement or deconfinement phase , since the fixed points on each side of the dashed line in fig.1 are infrared stable .",
    "the fixed point @xmath183 is infrared stable only along the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 . precisely for this reason it plays an important role in our discussion .",
    "the point is that @xmath184 vanishes for @xmath161 , which is the value of @xmath1 leading to @xmath160 .",
    "this result gives a string tension @xmath195 that vanishes for all @xmath5 , thus leading to a collapse of the fixed point @xmath183 into the fixed point of the noncompact theory .",
    "since the fixed point @xmath183 is unstable in the direction leading to the fixed point @xmath178 and the one of the noncompact theory , the latter will no longer be stable and only the confinement phase governed by the infrared stable fixed point @xmath178 will exist . note that while the string tension @xmath195 vanishes continously as @xmath1 approaches @xmath196 from above , this is not the case as @xmath1 approaches 36 from below .",
    "in fact , @xmath197 has a finite value for @xmath198 .",
    "since @xmath199 vanishes for @xmath51 , it follows that there is a universal jump in the string tension for @xmath198 .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the physical interspinon potential corresponds to the one associated with the infrared stable fixed point , i.e. , @xmath200 .",
    "since the fixed point @xmath183 is unstable , the dashed line represents a critical line separating confined and deconfined regimes .",
    "this role of a separatrix played by the dashed line of fig .",
    "1 is most clearly seen as @xmath1 cross the value @xmath161 , in which case the line collapses along the axes @xmath201 and @xmath176 , with the fixed point @xmath183 becoming identical to the one of the noncompact theory .    the phase of the system when @xmath185 is determined by the size of the debye - hckel parameter , @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the instanton density and @xmath204 the debye length . since for @xmath51",
    "only the fixed point at zero fugacity exists , we have that @xmath205 , i.e. , deconfinement occurs for @xmath51 and the large-@xmath1 result is essentially correct.@xcite     featuring the fixed points at nonzero fugacity given by eqs .

    "we have presented in this paper a description of the quantum spinon dynamics in a heisenberg antiferromagnet using a field theory of @xmath1 identical replica of fermions with a constraint .",
    "only the limit @xmath206 can be treated exactly , the lower @xmath1 results are obtained from different approximations .",
    "since @xmath6 corresponds to the physically interesting case , one may wonder to which extent our results are physically relevant .",
    "this question is hard to answer .",
    "originally , the study of spin liquids in 2 + 1 dimensions was motivated by the properties of high-@xmath12 cuprate superconductors.@xcite it was hoped that doping a mott insulator provides a mechanism for superconductivity in the cuprates . at zero doping the cuprates",
    "are antiferromagnetic insulators , i.e. , the global su(2 ) spin symmetry of the model is broken in the ground state .",
    "spin liquids , on the other hand , have no broken symmetries . nevertheless , by doping a spin liquid we expect to obtain a superconducting state.@xcite the idea was that doping may frustrate the magnetic state of the system and produce a spin liquid . with further doping",
    "the system would eventually become superconducting through a kind of hole condensation .",
    "hence doping plays a role similar to frustration due to the triangular lattice in the organic compound @xmath207-(et)@xmath208cu@xmath208(cn)@xmath87 , where a spin liquid phase was recently reported.@xcite    our analysis considers neither doping nor triangular lattices .",
    "instead , the spin liquid emerges from the large-@xmath1 limit , which provides the needed frustration to produce a spin liquid .",
    "our treatment at lower values of @xmath1 was based on an expansion in the instanton fugacity .",
    "this treatment is essentially non - perturbative , and as such difficult to control .",
    "nevertheless the stability of the spin liquid for large @xmath1 seems to be established beyond doubt .",
    "note , however , that the large-@xmath1 analysis of the lattice model is made in a particular representation of the su(n ) group , by writing the spin operators in terms of fermions.@xcite if the spin operators are written in terms of bosons  which is an equally valid description of the problem  other representations are obtained .",
    "in such a case the berry phase plays an essential role in determining the phases of the system.@xcite there @xmath1 is kept fixed and large , while a coupling constant @xmath209 related to the exchange constant is varied . in the lower phase ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the critical coupling , the su(n ) symmetry is broken and we have a nel - like state . for @xmath212 , on the other hand , the paramagnetic phase _ is not _ a spin liquid . instead , the so - called valence - bond solid ( vbs ) state emerges.@xcite for",
    "@xmath6 the vbs state can only occur if frustrating interactions respecting the su(2 ) symmetry are included in the hamiltonian .",
    "in such a scenario , where also an effective compact u(1 ) gauge theory is featured , the spinons are confined in both phases , but conjectured to be deconfined precisely at @xmath213 .",
    "this is the so called _ deconfined quantum criticality scenario _ and provides a new paradigm for quantum phase transitions.@xcite one of the main characteristics of the this new type of quantum criticality is a large value for the @xmath214 exponent . in",
    "which systems this new paradigm actually holds is still under discussion .",
    "there is a recent numerical evidence@xcite supporting the scenario proposed in ref . .",
    "on the other hand , it was recently demonstrated using large scale monte carlo simulations@xcite that quantum antiferromagnets with easy - plane anisotropy do not exhibit deconfined quantum criticality , contrary claims in ref . .",
    "in qsd , our analysis certainly breaks down for @xmath6 .",
    "the description in terms of the generalized sine - gordon theory ( [ sg - new ] ) no longer holds .",
    "the reason for this is that the derivation of the lagrangian ( [ sg - new ] ) assumes that the fermions are massless,@xcite and it is known that in noncompact qed@xmath44 the fermion mass is dynamically generated through chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) for small @xmath1.@xcite while the precise value of @xmath1 below which csb occurs is still a matter of debate , it seems to be more or less consensual that the chiral symmetry is broken for @xmath6.@xcite massive fermions modify the vacuum polarization in such a way that makes the derivation of an effective instanton lagrangian difficult . furthermore ,",
    "independent of the csb occuring in noncompact qed@xmath44 , confinement is likely to induce csb in qsd already for @xmath1 below and near 20 , in a regime where the effective lagrangian ( [ sg - new ] ) can still be considered to be valid . in any case , csb corresponds to spin density waves and this is precisely the state one would expect for undoped cuprates .",
    "the conclusion seems to be that no spin liquid state is possible for @xmath6 in the undoped system , unless frustrating interactions are added . in this case",
    "it may well be possible that a vbs emerges instead a spin liquid .",
    "moreover , the resulting paramagnetic state may depend on the nature of the frustration . here",
    "it is worth to mention that a local su(2 ) gauge theory of ( fermionic ) spinons for a frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet@xcite exhibits a stable spin liquid phase .",
    "when doping is included the rg analysis becomes considerably more difficult due to the coupling of the gauge field with a non - relativistic complex scalar field.@xcite in this case there are additional topological defects .",
    "these are vortex excitations coupled to the instantons .",
    "we are currently investigating this situation.@xcite",
    "in order to make the paper self - contained we consider here the general @xmath90-dimensional coulomb gas , whose rg equations were set up by kosterlitz.@xcite they were originally derived using the poor - man scaling approach . here",
    "we employ the method due to young,@xcite which is physically appealing , since it amounts to applying a scale - dependent debye - hckel argument which leads to the same results .",
    "although young applied the method to derive the rg equations associated to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition , it can easily be generalized to the @xmath90-dimensional case .",
    "we have done this previously @xcite to derive the rg equations for anomalous coulomb gases in @xmath90-dimensions .",
    "here we concentrate on the ordinary @xmath90-dimensional coulomb gas .",
    "next , in the spirit of the debye - hckel theory , we introduce an effective medium via a scale - dependent dielectric constant @xmath139 .",
    "this gives the renormalized electric field @xmath220 the dielectric constant @xmath221 is expressed in terms of the the susceptibility @xmath222 as @xmath223 where @xmath224 with @xmath225 being the surface of the unit sphere in @xmath90 dimensions , and @xmath226 is the polarizability . for small separation of a dipole pair , it is given approximately by @xmath227 the average number of dipole pairs is @xmath228 where @xmath61 is the bare fugacity and @xmath229 the renormalized potential obtained by integrating the renormalized electric field ( [ rene ] ) ,      the renormalized version of @xmath231 is @xmath232 where @xmath233 .",
