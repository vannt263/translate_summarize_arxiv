    "the kreutz system of sungrazers is by far the most prominent ensemble of closely related comets . named after the german astronomer for his monumental work on the orbital properties of its 19th century and earlier members ( kreutz 1888 , 1891 , 1901 ) , this comet system is unique .",
    "dynamically , the most peculiar attribute of its members is their extremely close approach to the sun at perihelion , when the heliocentric distance in an overwhelming number of cases is well below @xmath42",
    "@xmath5 ( 1  @xmath5 = 1  solar radius = 0.0046548  au ) or just about 0.01  au . due to perturbations , the perihelion distance can become less than the sun s radius , even though a _ de facto _ collision with the sun is prevented by disintegration .",
    "all kreutz sungrazers move about the sun in retrograde orbits , with an inclination in a range of .",
    "their orbital periods are , to the extent we can state , based on a few quality data available , probably between @xmath4600 and @xmath41000  years .",
    "the angular elements , pinpointing the spatial positions of the sungrazers orbital planes , may vary from object to object by up to at least 40@xmath3 and are subjected to the indirect perturbations by the planets , jupiter in particular .",
    "in contrast ,  the apsidal line orientation , as derived for the bright members with reliable orbits ( also referred to hereafter as the _ major sungrazers _ , such as c/1843  d1 , c/1882  r1 , c/1963  r1 , etc . ) , is essentially invariable , with trivial scatter ( sec .  2 ) .",
    "it is this _ fixed position of the line of apsides _ that marsden ( 2005 ) regarded as a paramount condition for defining the _ kreutz system s membership_. this definition reflects a common origin of all kreutz sungrazers and its significance is supported both by marsden s ( 1967 ) study of the indirect planetary perturbations ( resulting in a deviation , from one return to perihelion to the next , of typically a few tenths of a degree in the apsidal line ) and by s ( 2002 ) computation of perturbations due to cascading fragmentation of kreutz comets along the orbit ( similarly resulting in a difference of up to 0@xmath6.02 per event for a typical separation velocity of @xmath41 m s@xmath7 ) .",
    "no kreutz sungrazer bright enough to observe from the ground appeared between 1970 and 2011 .",
    "however , 19 fainter members were detected with coronagraphs on board two satellites between 1979 and 1989 ( see marsden 2005 for a review ) .",
    "this activity expanded dramatically following the launch , in late 1995 , of the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ; brueckner et al .",
    "1995 ) ; over 2000 kreutz sungrazers have so far been discovered , mostly by amateur astronomers , in images taken with the c2 and c3 coronagraphs on board _ soho _ since january 1996 .",
    "none of these faint members of the kreutz system , which we hereafter refer to as _ dwarf sungrazers _ , survived perihelion and none of them achieved a peak brightness greater than apparent magnitude of about @xmath80.5 ( e.g. , sekanina & kracht 2013 and the references therein ) .",
    "the beginnings of the consensus on a common origin of all kreutz sungrazers date back to the 19th century .",
    "this paradigm has been strengthened by more recent developments extensively reviewed by marsden ( 2005 ) in a paper , which the reader is referred to for details .",
    "accordingly , it is fitting to require that the _ invariable spatial orientation of the apsidal line _",
    ", typical for the kreutz system s bright members , _ be exhibited by all dwarf sungrazers _ as well .",
    "strangely , this fundamental issue has never been addressed in any detail .",

    "2008 ) between early 1996 and mid-2010 were single - handedly computed by marsden .",
    "this is a homogeneous set of orbits suitable for an in - depth study of apsidal - line orientation , even though the quality of astrometric positions measured from _ soho _ and _ stereo _ images is inferior ( because of a large pixel size ) compared to the quality of ground - based observations .",
    "one also should expect larger uncertainties in the orbital elements of the dwarf sungrazers because of their short orbital arcs under observation , but not any systematic trends .    even though the orbital elements of nearly 100 additional dwarf kreutz sungrazers , observed with _",
    "soho _ and _ stereo _ in the second half of 2010 , have recently been published by gray ( 2013 ) , we exclude these from our investigation to avoid mixing different orbit determination approaches .",
    "in this paper we employ the relationship among the angular elements  the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath0 ; the inclination , @xmath1 ; and the argument of perihelion , @xmath2  of the 1600 dwarf sungrazers to examine in detail their compliance with the condition of fixed apsidal orientation and to investigate the forces that affect their motions near the sun .",
    "the apsidal orientations of the bright and dwarf kreutz comets are derived , respectively , in secs .  2 and 3 , while a perturbation analysis of momentum changes in the orbital motions of the dwarf sungrazers is presented in sec .",
    "5 compares potential interpretations of detected variations in the apsidal orientation of the dwarf sungrazers , including the role of erosion - driven nongravitational effects , and sec .",
    "6 displays and explains the distribution of apsidal orientations from gravitational orbital solutions .",
    "further refinements in a model for determining the magnitude of an erosion - driven acceleration are introduced in secs .  7 and 8 , where implications of the findings are also addressed .",
    "9 offers a summary and conclusions , followed by our thoughts for future work in sec .",
    "high - quality sets of orbital elements are available only for seven bright kreutz sungrazers seen since the 1840s .",
    "all of them were more or less spectacular objects visible with the unaided eye and observed astrometrically over mostly extended periods of time from the ground , and their orbits have the lines of apsides nearly perfectly aligned .",

    "the maximum deviations from the adopted mean values amount to 0@xmath6.4 in the longitude and less than 0@xmath6.2 in the latitude . the curve that in plots of @xmath1 against @xmath0 and of @xmath2 against @xmath0 fits the coordinates ( 1 )",

    "a near - perfect alignment of the lines of apsides is unfortunately not what one finds when examining the relationship between the longitude of the ascending node and the inclination of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers , as is readily apparent from figure 1 .",
    "an overwhelming majority of these objects in the plot is distributed along an arc that passes through the location occupied by c/1843 d1 and makes a sizable angle with the curve of reference apsidal orientation .",

    "similarly , in figure 2 we plot the longitude of the ascending node against the argument of perihelion for the same set of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers .",

    "the roots of the inconsistence between the behavior of the major and the dwarf sungrazers in figure 1 are apparent from figure 3 in a plot of the orientation of the apsidal line of the dwarf comets against the position of their nodal line , that is , of @xmath9 and @xmath10 against @xmath0 . except for the scatter",

    "in addition to the thickly populated branch , which fits the position of comet c/1843 d1 , we recognize in figure  3 , just as in figure  1 , the two thinly populated branches that pass , respectively , through the positions of c/1970  k1 and c/2011  w3 .    by dividing the entire range of the longitudes of the ascending node into a number of intervals",

    "we followed a simple rule :  we first incorporated all dwarf kreutz sungrazers picked up by the computer code in the given range of @xmath0 ; next we inspected the inclinations of all these entries and eliminated those ( if any ) judged to be clearly out of acceptable bounds ; and finally we checked the arguments of perihelion of the remaining sungrazers and again removed those that appeared to be out of bounds to get the final set for each interval of @xmath0 .",

    "the rate is for the set in table  2 , but + 0.23 and + 0.19 , respectively , for the two sets in table  3 .",
    "the validity of this comparison may be questioned because the overall ranges of the longitude of the ascending node for the three sets are very different . however , in the intervals of @xmath0 covered by the two sets in table  3 , the thickly populated branch offers for @xmath27 even higher values than is the average , + 0.33 and + 0.30 , respectively .",
    "thus , this effect appears to be genuine .",

    "to summarize , the systematic trend in the perihelion latitude of the dwarf sungrazers appears to be linked to some effects that the bright members of the kreutz system manage to avoid . and",
    "because the dwarf sungrazers could not , as individual bodies , survive longer than one revolution about the sun ( otherwise they should be seen to recede from the sun after perihelion ) , the effects in figures  1 and 3 and in tables  2 and 3 should be a product of the dwarf sungrazers evolution in the course of this revolution about the sun .    tables 2 and 3 also present the averaged perihelion distance @xmath13 of the dwarf sungrazers in each interval of the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "we find that in the thickly populated branch the minimum nominal distance of @xmath41.1 @xmath5 is reached near but that the minima are closer to 1.41.5 @xmath5 in the two thinly populated branches .",
    "because of the uncertainties involved and also because the orbits of some of these objects were derived with the perihelion distance being forced by marsden to particular values ( sekanina 2002 ; see also sec .",
    "9 ) , one should not attach much significance to these variations .    a more interesting result is found from inspection of the entries for the interval of in table  2 .",
    "all five tabulated angles equal , within the limits of error , the respective angular elements of comet c/1843  d1 ( table  1 and sekanina & chodas 2008 ) .",
    "this match  strongly suggests a close relationship between this comet and the most populated branch of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers despite the 150 + years spanned between them .",
    "the contrast between the plot of @xmath1 against @xmath0 ( figure 1 ) , in which the dwarf kreutz sungrazers behave differently from the major members , and the plot of @xmath2 against @xmath0 , in which the two categories of objects almost overlap , is illustrated best by the calculated values of the elements at the ends of the @xmath0 range in table 2 . at",
    "the difference between the major and the dwarf members is nearly @xmath820@xmath3 in @xmath1 but only + 10@xmath3 in @xmath2 , while at it is + 9@xmath3 in @xmath1 but about @xmath83@xmath3 in @xmath2 .",
    "we next address  these discrepancies , as well as the differences in the behavior of @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers in figure 3 and tables 2 and 3 , in terms of perturbations caused by momentum changes in the dwarf sungrazers motions .",
    "the enormous population of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers could have arisen on the timescale of a single revolution about the sun only by cascading fragmentation of larger objects in the kreutz system , which are likely to have included some very massive members .",
    "one can hypothesize that , as a consequence of numerous fragmentation events , the orbits of the fragments have gradually been modified compared to the initial parent s orbit , and that their observed distribution reflects a cumulative effect of these modifications .",
    "if so , the question then arises about the nature of these effects that ( a )  show up in the plot of @xmath0 against @xmath1 , but not ( at least nowhere as prominently ) in the plot of @xmath0 against @xmath2 , and ( b )  manifest themselves as systematic variations in the perihelion latitude @xmath10 but not in the longitude @xmath9 .    aiming to examine the nature of the effect in figures 1 and 3 and in tables 2 and 3 , we begin with the relations between ( a )  the instantaneous rate of change , at time @xmath29 , of the angular orbital elements  @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32  and ( b )  the momentum acquired during a breakup , expressed in terms of the components of an acceleration @xmath33 imparted to a fragment relative to the parent body in the three cardinal directions defined by the heliocentric orbit of the parent in the radial ( away from the sun ) , r , transverse , t , and normal , n , directions of the right - handed rtn coordinate system .",

    "4 of the variations in the angular orbital elements and in the orientation of the line of apsides of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers orbits has shown that the observed systematic increase in the latitude of perihelion with the longitude of the ascending node in figure 3 and in tables 2 and 3 is  on the condition of an invariable longitude of perihelion ( also apparent from the figure and the two tables )  a product of some perturbations , or momentum increments , in the direction _",
    "normal _ to the comets orbital planes .",
    "this effect can in principle be either continuous or discrete .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is so profound that , if discrete , it must consist of a large number of individual events , because the separation velocities during a cometary splitting are known to be at most only a few meters per second ( e.g. , sekanina 1982 , 2005 ) , much too low to fit .",
    "the first scenario we consider is based on a hypothesis that the large range of perihelion latitudes represents an accumulation of minor impulses acquired by these dwarf comets during the many fragmentation events in the course of one revolution about the sun , from perihelion to next perihelion .    to scrutinize this hypothesis in some detail",
    ", we need to postulate a law governing the sequence of such fragmentation events and to estimate an average normal component of the impulse ( differential velocity ) a fragment ought to acquire per event in order to match the total observed effect . for this purpose",
    "we adopt the fragmentation sequence proposed by sekanina ( 2002 ) , which was found to be in fair agreement with the known sequence of secondary breakups of comet d/1993",
    "f2 ( shoemaker - levy  9 ) .",
    "the time @xmath67 of an @xmath68-th event is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the time of the primary fragmentation event ( close to perihelion ) , which is tidal or tidally - supported or triggered in nature ; @xmath71 is an initial interval for secondary fragmentation ; and is a dimensionless constant that describes the rate of fragmentation slowdown along the orbit .",
    "if we reckon time from perihelion , then and @xmath72 , the total number of fragmentation events or impulses imparted to a fragment , equals @xmath73}{\\log   \\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the orbital period .",
    "this equation is a relation between @xmath72 , @xmath75 , and @xmath71 . if , as was argued above , the dwarf kreutz sungrazers in the thickly populated branch in figure 1 are closely related to comet c/1843",
    "d1 and if this comet , as postulated in & chodas ( 2007 ) , is indeed the most massive known fragment of the celebrated sungrazer x/1106  c1 , then the dwarf kreutz sungrazers have orbital periods close to  years .",
    "next , it is necessary to adopt a certain breakup pattern .",
    "let us first consider that a kreutz fragment born from the primary breakup at the sun splits into two approximately equal pieces , each of which again breaks up into two about equal parts , etc .",
    ", until the fragments are eventually as small as the faint dwarf sungrazers . assuming 10@xmath76grams for the mass @xmath77 of the initial fragment and 10@xmath78grams for an average mass @xmath79 of the final products , the number of fragmentation events @xmath72 must satisfy a condition , so that in this case . equation ( 18 ) is now a relation between @xmath75 and @xmath71 . for example , for @xmath75 between 1.1 and 1.2 the initial interval @xmath71 drops from 2  years to 45  days .",
    "it is now possible to apply equation ( 13 ) to the proposed sequence of fragmentation events , described by pairs of various values of @xmath75 and @xmath71 . expressing @xmath54 in degrees , @xmath40 and @xmath49 in au , and @xmath48 in ms@xmath7 , the reciprocal gravitational constant .",
    "the product @xmath80 , the variable in eq.(13 ) for @xmath54 , reaches a peak value @xmath81 at a distance @xmath82 that is equal to the semimajor axis @xmath83 of the orbit . adopting  au and , or  au",
    ", we find  au and for any single event .    since the normal component of the separation velocity of fragments of the split comets does not exceed a few meters per second ( see the first paragraph of sec .  5 ) and , in addition , the sign of the expression for @xmath54 changes at aphelion ( because of @xmath84 ) , so that , we conclude that this scenario can not explain the magnitude of the systematic rate of change in the latitude of perihelion with the longitude of the ascending node in tables  23 and figure  3 .",
    "this holds true even if we adopt a different breakup pattern with a much greater total number of fragmentation events and/or a different law governing their sequence .",
    "this information is consistent with the perturbations due to a fragment s separation velocity , listed in table 8 of sekanina ( 2002 ) .",
    "while a normal velocity of 5  ms@xmath7 can trigger a change of up to nearly 27@xmath3 in the longitude of the nodal line and up to nearly 5@xmath3 in the inclination , it fails to shift the latitude of perihelion by even 0@xmath6.1 .",
    "this category of hypotheses regards sizable deviations of the lines of apsides of dwarf kreutz sungrazers from the line of reference apsidal orientation ( figure 3 and tables 2 and 3 ) to be an effect of a continuous force , which is nongravitational in nature and acts while these sungrazers are under observation .",
    "we first discuss briefly the lorentz force , which acts in the direction normal to the orbital plane .",
    "the lorentz force is known to appreciably affect the motions of submicron - sized charged particles of dust .",
    "compelling evidence suggests , however , that the dust tails of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers , consisting of such microscopic grains , are subjected to no detectable effects of the lorentz force ( sekanina 2000 , thompson 2009 ) . on the strength of this argument",
    ", it is inconceivable that the nuclei of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers could be subjected to this force to an extent of triggering a major effect of the kind examined .",
    "an alternative scenario is based on an assumption that these are effects due to a momentum transferred to the nucleus by sublimation of water ice _ and/or _ more refractory species at small heliocentric distances , at which the dwarf kreutz sungrazers are observed . such small heliocentric distances are strongly suggested by a peak inclination near in figure  1 .",
    "this value of @xmath0 corresponds to in figure  2 .",
    "furthermore , the peak inclination requires that in eq.(15 ) , so that , equivalent to a time a little less than 1  day before perihelion , when the dwarf sungrazers are indeed observed .    in order for this scenario to work",
    " that is , to explain the effect normal to the orbital plane  we need to test whether the introduction into the equations of motion of a term containing a normal component of the momentum - transfer acceleration could offer orbital solutions in which the angular elements are consistent with the reference apsidal orientation presented in table  1 .",
    "the standard orbit determination technique , which was developed by marsden et al .  ( 1973 ) and whose versions are nowadays almost universally employed worldwide to compute cometary orbits , sets up the nongravitational terms in the three cardinal directions of an rtn right - handed coordinate system , identical to that in sec .",
    "the introduced law , @xmath85 ( see sec .",
    "7 ) , mimicks the dependence of an averaged water - ice sublimation rate on heliocentric distance @xmath49 .",
    "the magnitude of the momentum - transfer acceleration at 1  au from the sun is measured by the so - called style  ii parameters , @xmath86 in the radial direction ( away from the sun ) , @xmath87 in the transverse direction in the orbital plane , and @xmath88 in the direction normal to the orbital plane ( marsden et al .",

    "each selected dwarf sungrazer was to satisfy these conditions :  ( i )  be a member of the thickly populated branch in figure 1 ; ( ii )  the value of @xmath0 to come from a broad range of the longitudes of the ascending node , between @xmath4300@xmath3 and @xmath440@xmath3 ( table 2 ) ; ( iii ) as published , the parabolic orbit be consistent with a least - squares solution , with no element forced to any particular value ; and ( iv )  the orbit be based on at least seven astrometric positions , measured from the images taken with the c2 coronagraph on board the _ soho _ satellite and/or with one of the cor2 coronagraphs on board the two _ stereo _ spacecraft .",
    "this last condition stems from our focus on the final segment of the trajectory and from our need to have astrometric observations of the best possible quality . because of the pixel sizes , 11@xmath91.4 for the c2 coronagraph and 14@xmath91.7 for the cor2 coronagraphs",

    "two sets of orbital elements were derived .",
    "the first set was a parabolic gravitational solution , whereas the second set was a restricted nongravitational solution , which employed a parabolic approximation and marsden et al.s ( 1973 ) standard formalism , in which we assumed that and which we used to search for the magnitude of the acceleration component normal to the orbit plane , . because of fairly large uncertainties in the astrometric observations and very short orbital arcs observed , we decided at this point not to incorporate @xmath88 as a variable directly into the least - squares differential optimization procedure , but , instead , to proceed by iteration .    based on our estimates of several meters for the nuclear sizes of faint dwarf kreutz sungrazers near the end of their lifetime ( by extrapolating the derived diameters of brighter ones ; e.g. , sekanina 2003 ) and on the highest known values of auday@xmath90 ( marsden&williams 2008 ) among ordinary long - period comets ( in particular , objects such as c/1993  a1 or c/1998  p1 ) with presumably kilometer- or subkilometer - sized nuclei , we began each computer run with an initial value of auday@xmath90 .",
    "this was a fairly conservative estimate since the comparison comets , of perihelion distances comparable to or exceeding 1  au , imply momentum - transfer effects due almost exclusively to water ice driven sublimation , while at the heliocentric distances at which the dwarf kreutz sungrazers are observed  around 0.05  au or @xmath411  @xmath5  numerous species less volatile than water ice also sublimate profusely .",
    "together with progressive fragmentation this should increase the magnitude of the momentum - transfer acceleration .",
    "thus , applying a least - squares optimization procedure to derive the orbital elements , without removing any of the astrometric positions available , we searched for a value of @xmath88 that , in the context of the common origin of the kreutz sungrazers ( sec .  1 ) , provided a minimum offset from the reference apsidal orientation .",
    "the results for eight test dwarf kreutz sungrazers are summarized in table  4 , in which we compare three sets of orbital solutions .",
    "the first set , in the row _ cat .",
    "_ , is the orbit as computed by marsden ; it is copied either from marsden & williams ( 2008 ) catalogue ( entries 13 and 6 ) , or from mpc6359963601 ( entries 4 and 78 ) or mpc66704 ( entry 5 ) .    the second set , in the row _ grav .",
    "_ , represents our own parabolic gravitational approximation .",
    "we made this run in order to confirm that marsden s results , the details of which have never been published , are closely reproduced .",
    "comparison with the catalogued orbital elements tolerated formal differences of up to a few tenths of a degree in the angular elements and up to 0.01@xmath5 in the perihelion distance .",
    "as expected , the perihelion times always agreed to better than 0.01  day .",
    "however , a number of objects , especially from the earlier times , considered initially as suitable test cases , had to be rejected , because the catalogued perihelion distances were forced by marsden , usually upwards but sometimes downwards , to make them exceed 1@xmath5 but stay smaller than @xmath42@xmath5 .",
    "this manipulation resulted in changes in the other elements as well , including the longitude of the ascending node , and consequently interfered with our effort to have the test sungrazers distributed more or less uniformly between and .",
    "the third set , in the row ( @xmath88 ) , is our nongravitational solution , referred to above .",
    "the deviation of an iterated value of @xmath88 from the value we were searching for was measured by an offset of the iterated apsidal orientation , given by the perihelion coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath98   & & \\\\[-0.28 cm ] \\sin b_\\pi & = & \\sin \\omega \\ , \\sin i , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the reference orientation .",

    "for the seven cases with offsets smaller than 1@xmath3 , the perihelion distance is confined to a narrow range from 1.00  @xmath5 to 1.08  @xmath5 .",
    "our a priori estimate of 10@xmath106au day@xmath90 for the parameter @xmath88 compares rather favorably with the results .",
    "it is within a factor of @xmath44 for six of the eight entries in table  4 and is closer to the lower end of the range .",
    "the @xmath88 values statistically correlate both with the offsets from the line of apsides and with the longitudes of the ascending node derived from the gravitational solutions .",
    "however , as confirmed by our additional tests , there is no functional correlation .",
    "the crossover from negative to positive values of @xmath88 is near the position of comet c/1843  d1 .    of much interest",
    "are the magnitudes of @xmath107 at the upper end of their range .",
    "the value for comet c/2007  x13 ( normalized to a distance of 1  au from the sun ) is equivalent to 0.503  cm  s@xmath90 , alarmingly close to 0.593  cm  s@xmath90 , the sun s gravitational acceleration . at a heliocentric distance of about 0.046",
    "au , at which the comet s image was last astrometrically measured , the sun s gravitational acceleration is 280  cm  s@xmath90 , or 0.140 au day@xmath90 , while the applied nongravitational law predicts for this distance a water - ice sublimation rate 768  times greater than at 1  au from the sun , so that the nongravitational acceleration at 0.046  au was 387  cm  s@xmath90 or 0.193  au  day@xmath90 .",
    "the results in table  4 thus imply that at the end of its visible trajectory , _",
    "c/2007  x13 was subjected to a normal component of the nongravitational acceleration that exceeded the sun s gravitational acceleration by nearly 40  percent ! _ for the other objects in table  4 the numbers are less extreme but still remarkable .",
    "we should also comment on the relative magnitude of the rms residuals from the orbital solutions in the last column of table 4 . not in a single case",
    "is the formal fit from the nongravitational solution markedly worse than from the gravitational solution .",
    "thus , the introduction of @xmath88 was tolerable from the data - analysis standpoint ; it was of course vital from the standpoint of our dynamical arguments .",
    "the equivalence of the gravitational and nongravitational solutions in terms of the rms residuals is not surprising ; it is simply a sign of fairly low accuracy of the astrometric observations .",
    "it is the offset from the apsidal line and not the formal quality of fit that is the _ driver _ in our undertaking this task and the _ prime criterion _ in measuring the significance of the results .    graphically , the reduction of the ranges of the three angular elements @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 brought about by the introduction of the nongravitational term with the parameter @xmath88 , is dramatically revealed by figures  5 and 6 . from figure  5",
    "it is obvious that all test sungrazers whose gravitational solutions were distributed along the thickly populated branch associated with c/1843  d1 are in their nongravitational solutions distributed tightly along the line of apsides instead .",
    "all shifts in the test objects positions in the plot of @xmath0 against @xmath1 , however large , were accomplished by `` sliding '' along , not across , the curve .",
    "our last comment on the results in table 4 and figures  5 and 6 is to point out the unanswered questions and employed approximations .",
    "although the nongravitational solutions for the eight test sungrazers appear to be satisfactory and are responsive to the argument based on the observed trend in @xmath10 from gravitational solutions , the effects driven by the process of erosion should , in general , include a radial component ( parameter @xmath86 ) and a transverse component ( parameter @xmath87 ) as well . while the two components in the orbital plane do not affect the longitude of the ascending node or the inclination directly , the introduction into the equations of motion of their contributions could affect the value of @xmath88 as well .",
    "we return to this issue , which requires a fuller incorporation of erosion - driven effects , in sec .",
    "an important question to answer is whether the enormous scatter in the angular orbital elements of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers derived from the gravitational solutions is only a dynamical effect , as discussed in the previous section or whether there also is a significant contribution from the errors of measurement and/or reduction of the astrometric observations . to address this question , the plot in figure 7 shows , as a function of a limiting offset @xmath108 , a cumulative distribution of these objects whose angular offsets @xmath99 from the reference apsidal orientation exceed , or are equal to , @xmath108 .",
    "figure 7 and table 5 , which summarizes the results from the cumulative distribution , show that the offsets from the reference apsidal orientation are the largest for the set of sungrazers observed with the c2 coronagraph only .",
    "this suggests that the gravitational orbits of the dwarf sungrazers are the most inaccurate when they are based only on astrometric observations from c2 images .",
    "this effect could be instrumental , because the orbital arcs in c2 are shorter and the number of reference stars is sometimes insufficient or their field distribution strongly nonuniform , both of which may lead to inferior orbital solutions .",
    "on the other hand , due to the much smaller pixel size of the c2 coronagraph , the astrometry should be better .",
    "perplexingly , if the greater offsets in figure  7 were an instrumental effect , one would expect that the _",
    "c3 only _ distribution curve should lie below the _ other than c2 only _ distribution , because the latter includes largely the sungrazers whose orbits were based on images from both c3 and c2 .",
    "this expectation is however contradicted in the figure , as the _",
    "c3 only _ distribution shows that the orbits based on c3 images yield offsets that are larger than those from the orbits based on c3 _ plus _ c2 , so that c2 images improve the orbits .",
    "we suggest that the solution to this puzzle lies in the same issue that led us to examine a set of representative examples of sungrazers observed _ only _ in c2 , that is , at the very end of their trajectory . at this late evolutionary phase ,",
    "the size of the nucleus of a dwarf sungrazer is near zero because of escalating erosion , and the deviation from a gravitational motion is at a maximum .",

    "this comparison led to our discovery that the ougassing - driven accelerations for the dwarf sungrazers were orders of magnitude higher than those for ordinary comets and in the extreme cases comparable in magnitude to the sun s gravitational acceleration .",

    "although the temperature varies over the surface greatly , for the orbit - determination purposes the formula ( 22 ) has over the many decades provided excellent service and still is employed nowadays .    encouraged by the results summarized in table 4 , we continued our experimentation with the nongravitational terms in the equations of motion by testing nongravitational solutions for the dwarf kreutz sungrazers observed with the c2 coronagraph by directly incorporating the parameter @xmath88 , next to the orbital elements , as a variable into the least - squares optimization procedure . employing marsden et al.s ( 1973 ) formalism",

    "5.2 ) that this effort is doomed to failure , given the uncertainties of the _ soho _ astrometry and very short orbital arcs of the objects observed only with the c2 coronagraph .",

    "is strongly supported by the fact that numerous species considerably less volatile than water ice , including atomic sodium ( e.g. , knight et al .",

    "it is therefore highly doubtful that the sublimation of water ice typically dominates the erosion process in close proximity to the sun .",
    "accordingly , the issue of an appropriate momentum - transfer law for the dwarf sungrazers needs comprehensive examination .",

    "we introduce three such laws .",
    "one of them , @xmath116 , is based on the sublimation of sodium ( derived from the dependence of the saturated vapor pressure on temperature ; e.g. , hicks 1963 ) , which is known to outgas profusely from dwarf kreutz sungrazing comets ( e.g. , biesecker et al.2002 ; sekanina 2003 ; knight et al .  2010 ) .",

    "although the scaling distance @xmath117 is much smaller than for water ice , in a range of heliocentric distances where the dwarf kreutz sungrazers are typically observed , sodium and water ice sublimate at rates that have a similar dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "we would therefore expect that the two laws should lead to similar results , a circumstance that is useful in checking the validity of computations .",
    "the second employed momentum - transfer law refers to one of very highly refractory materials  forsterite , the magnesium - rich end - member of the olivine solid solution series ( mg@xmath118sio@xmath119 ) , a common silicate in comets , including kreutz sungrazers ( e.g. , sekanina 2000 , kimura et al .",

    ".    inspection of table 6 suggests the following :  ( i )  the resulting values of @xmath124 from the solutions based on the standard law and the sodium sublimation law are practically identical , as expected , for all eight test sungrazers ; ( ii )  the nongravitational acceleration for c/2007  x13 at 10  @xmath5 from the sun exceeds the sun s gravitational acceleration by up to nearly 40  percent ; for the other seven comets it is smaller , but it always amounts to more than 1  percent of the sun s attraction ; ( iii )  for five comets ( c/2007  x13 , c/2007  x3 , c/2008  m4 , c/2006  j9 , and c/2008  k8 ) the modified nongravitational law provides the best solution in terms of the apsidal - line offset ; while for c/2001  y4 the solutions based on the modified law , the standard law , and the sodium sublimation law all fit the data equally well ; no minimum apsidal - line offset was found among the solutions based on the modified law for c/2009  l5 and c/2008  m5 ; ( iv )  for c/2009  l5 the ice , sodium , and forsterite sublimation laws offer equally good solutions in terms of the apsidal - line offset , but the solution based on the forsterite sublimation law provides a  fit with a rms residual superior to those from the solutions based on the other two laws ; ( v )  for c/2008  m5 , the best fit results by a narrow margin from the solution based on the sodium sublimation law ; ( vi )  the forsterite sublimation law does not work for c/2008  k8 ; ( vii )  in terms of the scaling distance of the modified law , the comets are divided into three groups :  two ( c/2007  x3 and c/2008  m4 ) have the nongravitational variations steeper than even the forsterite sublimation law ; three ( c/2006  j9 , c/2008  k8 , and c/2007  x13 ) have the variations steeper than the sodium sublimation law , but less steep than the forsterite sublimation law ; and only one ( c/2001  y4 ) has variations less steep than the sodium law , though still steeper than the ice sublimation law .",
    "to summarize , in terms of the apsidal - line offset and the rms residual , the water - ice sublimation law proves competitive with the other three laws only in the case of c/2001  y4 . for the remaining seven comets , the laws with smaller scaling distances , that is , implying steeper variations , are superior , suggesting that momentum - transfer effects driven by the sublimation of species substantially less volatile than water ice dominate the motions of these kreutz sungrazers",

    "no three - parameter nongravitational solution has been attempted , because a single - parameter solution already implies an offset smaller than the stipulated limit of 0@xmath6.2 . for the remaining entries of table  7 ,",
    "the three - parameter solution was successfully carried out , yielding in most cases the radial component positive and dominating the other two components .",
    "the exceptions are c/2007  x3 and c/2008  m4 , for which the radial component came out to be negative , for which we do not have an explanation .",
    "the sungrazers c/2007 x3 and c/2008 m4 are , together with c/2009  l5 , the objects in tables 6 and 7 with the most steeply varying nongravitational accelerations , characterized by the smallest scaling distances @xmath117 .",
    "next comes another group of three  c/2006  j9 , c/2007  x13 , and c/2008  k8  whose scaling distances are in a range from 0.05  au to 0.15  au , intermediate between those of the forsterite sublimation law and the sodium sublimation law .",
    "the equivalent sublimation heat is estimated at 50000 to 80,000 cal mol@xmath7 .",
    "the motion of c/2008  m5 was fitted best by the sodium sublimation law , and the volatile end is represented by c/2001  y4 , whose motion appears to have been affected by sublimation of species that may have included water ice ; the effective sublimation heat is estimated at between 13000 and 15000  cal mol@xmath7 .",
    "because the laws applicable to the last two sungrazers vary essentially as an inverse square of heliocentric distance along the observed arcs of the orbits , there could be contributions from the solar radiation pressure ( but only in @xmath147 of course ) , if the nuclei of these comets were already shattered into dust at the time .",
    "the very high nongravitational accelerations , already mentioned in sec .",
    "5.2 , are fully confirmed , including the record value of @xmath124 for c/2007  x13 , which is 134  percent of the sun s gravitational acceleration .",
    "similarly , the overall nongravitational accelerations of c/2001  y4 and c/2009  l5 amount to , respectively , 67 and 51  percent of the sun s attraction .",
    "even the least overall nongravitational accelerations in table  7 are still on the order of @xmath420  percent of the sun s attraction .",
    "there are at least three physical processes that operate on the dwarf sungrazers in the final phase of their disintegration near the end of the visible trajectory and are responsible for the very high nongravitational accelerations applied to the test objects in table 7 :  sublimation , fragmentation , and the sun s radiation pressure . the joint contribution to the acceleration from the first two processes , which result in erosion of the sungrazer s nucleus , with a progressive loss rate of its mass ,",
    "can numerically be simulated by the law @xmath135 , whereas the radiation pressure acceleration varies of course as @xmath153 except at close proximity to the sun , where it increases as ; this rate of variation is 1.03 times steeper than the inverse square law 3@xmath5 from the sun , 1.15 times steeper at 1.5@xmath5 , 1.29 times at 1.2@xmath5 , and 1.53 times steeper at 1.05@xmath5 .",
    "we begin with the conservation of momentum law , which requires that a relative mass erosion rate , @xmath154 , of a comet generates an acceleration @xmath155 on its nucleus of mass @xmath156 , which at time @xmath29 satisfies a relation @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the outflow velocity of the eroded mass , @xmath159 is a factor that accounts for the degree of its collimation , and the minus sign indicates that @xmath158 and @xmath160 , both taken here as positive quantities , point in opposite directions .",

    "when measured by @xmath184 , a mass loss over a @xmath44-hour long period , typically involved , was found from the ratios @xmath185 to be equivalent to a decrease in the effective dimensions by two to five orders of magnitude . however , this result overestimates the rate of mass drop because @xmath184 is , as seen from table  7 , dominated by the radial component @xmath147 . since much of the mass of the nucleus of a dwarf sungrazer in this late stage of disintegration is reduced to expanding clouds of dust , including microscopic particles , a fraction of the detected acceleration is necessarily contributed by the sun s radiation pressure .",
    "loss effects due to erosion are more realistically estimated from the transverse and normal components , which include no contributions from solar radiation pressure . in that case",
    "the decrease in the effective nuclear size over the 4  hours is found to amount to @xmath186 to 2@xmath186 orders of magnitude , a result that suggests the objects imminent decay .",
    "the heliocentric distances at which the test dwarf sungrazers were observed ranged from 14.5 to 8@xmath5 .",
    "the presence of nongravitational laws with slopes much steeper than the square of heliocentric distance even this close to the sun ( which is the case primarily with c/2007  x3 , c/2008  m4 , and c/2006  j9 ) does not necessarily rule out effects of radiation pressure , because the dust grains continue to fragment rapidly and the radiation - pressure acceleration varies inversely as the grain size , except for particles not exceeding in size a small fraction of a  micron .",
    "we are aware of the limitations that uncertainties in the astrometric data and short orbital arcs covered by the observations place on the quality of the orbit determination . as a result",
    ", the orbits in table  7 should be perceived with great caution .",
    "observational errors are likely to be responsible for the two dynamically meaningless cases of negative @xmath147 ( c/2007  x3 and c/2008  m4 ) .",
    "we also readily admit that the orbital sets and nongravitational parameters of all test sungrazers in table  7 do not necessarily present unique solutions .",
    "on the other hand , we notice a high concentration of perihelion distances between 1.0 and 1.1  @xmath5 among the nongravitational solutions in both table  4 and 7 , which is significant . in the other elements ,",
    "the deviations between the two sets of nongravitational solutions do not exceed a few degrees in @xmath2 and @xmath0 , but only 1@xmath3 in @xmath1 , and 0.03  day in @xmath94 .",
    "the prime objective of this paper was to understand the discrepancy in the spatial orientation of apsidal lines between the bright and the dwarf members of the kreutz sungrazing system , as revealed by their catalogued purely gravitational orbits .",
    "the apsidal lines of seven bright kreutz sungrazers , observed from the ground in the years 18432011 , are nearly perfectly aligned ( to within a small fraction of 1@xmath3 ) , whereas the apsidal lines of about 1600 faint , dwarf kreutz sungrazers , detected only with the coronagraphs on board the _ soho _ and _ stereo _ spacecraft between early 1996 and mid-2010 , are distributed along an arc extending @xmath425@xmath3 in perihelion latitude @xmath10 but not in perihelion longitude @xmath9 , which is statistically invariable and equal to @xmath9 of the bright sungrazers .",
    "a corollary of this peculiar effect in a plot of the orbit inclination against the longitude of the ascending node is a distribution of the dwarf sungrazers along three parallel curves , each of which subtends an angle of about 15@xmath3 with the curve of the reference apsidal line , populated by the bright sungrazers , and passes through , respectively , the locations in the plot of comets c/1843  d1 , c/1970  k1 , and c/2011  w3 .",
    "the differences between the apsidal - line orientation patterns of the dwarf and the bright kreutz sungrazers suggest that the dwarf objects failed to avoid exposure to nongravitational dynamical forces that the bright ones managed to escape . from the perturbation theory we find that the dwarf sungrazers extension of the apsidal - line distribution in @xmath10 is a product of nongravitational accelerations , directed normal to the orbital plane .",
    "the broader is the range of these accelerations acting on individual dwarf sungrazers , the wider is the spread in the objects angular elements .",
    "we examined several different processes that could potentially generate the major effects in the latitude @xmath10 .",
    "the only plausible trigger appears to be the erosion - driven transfer of momentum from outgassing to progressively fragmenting debris of the original nucleus of the dwarf sungrazer .",
    "this conceptual model  deems   the motions of dwarf sungrazers by any purely gravitational orbit inappropriate and emphasizes the need to apply , instead , a nongravitational orbit whose apsidal line matches the reference apsidal line as closely as possible . for each dwarf sungrazer",
    "this condition requires ( i )  the incorporation of a nongravitational term with an unknown parameter into the equations of motion ; ( ii )  the iteration of the orbital solution with the nongravitational term until a minimum offset from the reference apsidal line is reached ; and ( iii )  the determination of a final set of orbital elements and the nongravitational parameter as products of the corrected apsidal - line offset .",
    "a successful implementation of this corrective procedure requires that the quality of fitting the astrometric observations ( that is , their rms residual ) by the nongravitational solution be better than , or comparable to , that by the gravitational solution .    to examine the nature and the magnitudes of the nongravitational forces , we employed a sample of eight test dwarf sungrazers whose gravitational orbits were distributed nearly uniformly along a @xmath490@xmath3-long arc in the longitude of the ascending node , between 305@xmath3 and 33@xmath3 .",
    "the gravitational solutions left offsets from the reference apsidal line of up to @xmath417@xmath3 ( table  4 ) ; to rectify these unacceptably large deviations , we proceeded in three steps .    in the first step , we applied the standard style  ii formalism by marsden et al .",
    "( 1973 ) that incorporates the nongravitational terms into the equations of motion . because of the strong trends in @xmath10 , we focused on the normal component of the erosion - driven acceleration , which we introduced into the computations iteratively and minimized the offset of each dwarf sungrazer s orbit from the reference apsidal - line orientation to find the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "we assumed in this step that the radial and transverse components of the nongravitational acceleration were nil , .",
    "the resulting parameters @xmath88 for the eight test dwarf sungrazers were on the orders of 10@xmath187 to 10@xmath188  au  day@xmath90 , at least one order and up to three orders of magnitude _",
    "greater _ than the largest values of @xmath86 among the non - kreutz comets catalogued by marsden & williams ( 2008 ) .",
    "c/2007  x13 was found to be subjected to a _",
    "nongravitational acceleration greater than the sun s gravitational acceleration _ at the same heliocentric distance .",
    "the derived parameters approximately correlated with the offsets from the reference apsidal line left by the gravitational orbital solutions .",
    "these offsets were reduced by the nongravitational solutions substantially , never to exceed 1@xmath6.4 .    because marsden et al.s ( 1973 ) formalism employs a momentum - transfer law based on the assumption that the nongravitational acceleration is driven by outgassing of water ice , we compared , in our second step , this standard law with a few novel laws that describe outgassing of other species , more likely than water ice to match the sublimation conditions at extremely small distances , about 10  @xmath5 , from the sun , where the dwarf kreutz sungrazers are typically observed ( footnote c to table  7 ) .",
    "the most powerful among the tested scenarios was the _ modified law _",
    ", with a variable scaling distance @xmath117 , linked to the degree of volatility of outgassing species .",
    "this exercise illustrates a great variety of behavior among the test sungrazers , from cases suggesting that outgassing is dominated by substances more refractory than forsterite to those with substances more volatile than sodium and almost as volatile as water ice .",
    "the magnitudes of the erosion - driven acceleration did not change substantially from those found in the first step .",
    "the test objects apsidal - line offsets offered by the best fitting nongravitational laws were now further reduced to less than 0@xmath6.7 .",
    "the default condition , , was relaxed in the third step , in which only the statistical constraint was still retained .",
    "the expansion from single - component to three - component nongravitational solutions was computationally much more demanding , even though an employed relationship between the radial and transverse components meant an increase by only one parameter .",
    "for each of the test comets we used a solution based on the law that provided the least offset from the reference apsidal - line orientation , usually the modified law .",
    "the offsets for all eight tested sungrazers were now reduced to less than 0@xmath6.2 , the level of intrinsic scatter in the orientation of the reference line of apsides among the bright sungrazers ( table  1 ) ; and , remarkably , in four cases the offset did not even exceed 0@xmath6.01 .    even though the rms residual was not a criterion by which we judged the quality of orbital solutions , the results in table  7 show that the final nongravitational sets of orbital elements provide a significantly better fit than the gravitational solutions ( table  4 ) in one case and slightly to moderately better fits in three cases , and that the fits are comparable in the remaining four cases .",
    "the parameters @xmath147 to @xmath124 in table  7 show that at a distance of 10  @xmath5 from the sun , _ all _ test dwarf sungrazers were subjected to nongravitational accelerations of more than 15  percent of the sun",
    "s gravitational acceleration , or more than two orders of magnitude higher than implied by the peak outgassing - driven accelerations for the catalogued comets in nearly parabolic orbits .",
    "there are two more points to emphasize .",
    "the first is that the eight test sungrazers do by no means represent a random sample .",
    "the condition that the orbits of the test objects be approximately uniformly distributed in the longitude of the ascending node required a careful selection of appropriate candidates .",
    "it was the small number of astrometric observations made with the c2 coronagraph that caused difficulties .",
    "the second point has to do with the catalogued gravitational orbits of the dwarf kreutz sungrazers .",
    "we required in this paper that for each selected test object the set of orbital elements computed by marsden be closely reproduced by our code .",
    "this turned out to be more constraining than first thought , because in his effort to obtain a sungrazing - like orbit marsden sometimes manipulated the values of the elements by assuming a particular value for the perihelion distance .",
    "the first author has been aware of marsden s frustration with this issue for a number of _ soho / stereo _ sungrazers .",
    "he altogether too often obtained a perihelion distance smaller than the sun s radius , which  especially in early years . ]",
    " he considered unphysical . on other occasions , the perihelion distance came out to be much too large , so that , without manipulation , he could not classify the object as a sungrazer in spite of the signature in the angular elements .",
    "since marsden s forcing a perihelion distance affected the other elements as well , all such cases curtailed the list of candidates for our test objects .    in this context , the strong concentration of perihelion distances just beyond 1  @xmath5 , apparent from table  7 ( as well as from the nongravitational solutions in table  4 ) and",
    "already commented on , is notable . given a scatter of 0.8  @xmath5 in the perihelion distances from the gravitational orbits of the test sungrazers ( table 4 ) , the apsidal - line constraint should in no way",
    "cause the sharp peak in the distribution .",
    "it therefore appears that the introduction of the nongravitational terms into the equations of motion improved substantially the quality of orbit determination , even though the realistic errors in the elements in table  7 are greater than the last decimal places carried . from comparison of the nongravitational sets of elements in table  4 with those in table   7",
    ", we estimate that the errors are on the order of 0.01  day in @xmath94 , from 0@xmath6.1 to a degree or so in @xmath2 and @xmath0 , from better than 0@xmath6.1 to nearly 1@xmath3 in @xmath1 , and from better than 0.01@xmath5 to @xmath40.1@xmath5 in @xmath13 ; the least well determined orbit appears to be that of c/2007  x3 , which happens to be derived from only 7 astrometric observations .",
    "application of a basic mass - loss model for the test dwarf sungrazers suggests that while observed in the  field of the _ soho _",
    "c2 coronagraph , along the terminal segment of their orbits , the nuclei fragmented copiously and their dimensions shrank at a dramatic rate , resulting in the objects imminent decay , as illustrated by schrijver et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in the case of c/2011  n3 . along the radial direction ,",
    "the nongravitational effect due to erosion - driven momentum transfer should , in the late stage of disintegration , have been enhanced , to at least a limited degree , by solar radiation pressure acting on the microscopic debris of the nucleus .",
    "the results of our orbital analysis strongly suggest that due to a major erosion of their mass , the   of dwarf kreutz - system comets are in close proximity to the sun subjected to a momentum - transfer effect of such magnitude that :  ( i )  their motions can not be fitted by employing the gravitational law alone , as such orbital solutions lead to grossly misleading results , and ( ii )  the apsidal - line orientations derived from such solutions require major corrective measures , whose application is involved and time consuming . yet , the gravitational orbits are the only orbital data currently available for the dwarf kreutz sungrazers .",
    "a perplexing issue is what to do to rectify this situation ?",
    "a skeptic would suggest that the quality of astrometric observations of the dwarf comets from _ soho / stereo _ images is too poor to mount a massive project in an effort to fix the problem .",
    "in fact , reference to the low accuracy of the positional data has often been an argument used to question the merit of these objects published orbital elements in the first place . our results",
    " although based on a very limited data sample  suggest that these doubts are not necessarily justified and that the problem can in principle be cured by appropriately accounting for the large erosion - driven nongravitational forces .    in practical terms ,",
    "should the orbits of all , or in the least a sizable fraction , of the dwarf sungrazers of the kreutz system be reanalyzed from scratch ?",
    "the authors admit that they have neither  resources nor a motivation for getting involved with such a large - scale but essentially routine project that should basically follow the algorithm prescribed in this paper .",
    "accordingly , we limit our comments to acknowledging that the current state of orbital analysis of the body of these objects is rather depressing , but we refrain from proposing a workable plan of action beyond merely recognizing that the task requires highly sophisticated computer - driven automation . + the authors thank a.  vitagliano for modifications in his code _ exorb7 _ that he made at our request and thus allowed us to pursue all planned steps in our investigation .",
