    "similarly , multi - epoch observations of some high velocity pulsars show evidence for h  i 21  cm opacity variation on scales of 5 - 100 au @xcite .",
    "several other pulsars however do not show opacity variations @xcite , leading to suggestions that the occurrence of fine scale structure in the galaxy may be rare .",
    "much of these observed fluctuations on au scales were earlier believed to originate in h  i `` clouds '' with densities @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "it is hard to explain the existence of such structures in equilibrium with other , orders of magnitude lower density , components of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite has shown that the observed small scale transverse variations have contributions from structure on all scales and that the fluctuations at larger spatial scales could , in projection , produce the measured small scale fluctuations .",
    "conversely , there are other observational and numerical simulation results supporting the existence of tiny scale structures which have a size of @xmath13 au , with a density of @xmath14 @xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with an evaporation timescale of @xmath15 myr , these structures can survive only if the ambient pressure is much higher than the normal value or if they are formed continuously on a comparable timescale .",
    "details regarding their origin and physical properties are , however , still not understood . on somewhat larger scales , @xcite measured opacity variations of the h  i absorption across cassiopeia a and cygnus a , and found that the power spectrum of these fluctuations could be fairly well represented by a power law .",
    "the slope of the power law was similar for the absorption in the perseus arm ( towards cas  a ) and the outer arm ( towards cygnus a ) , but substantially different for that from absorption towards cygnus a arising in the local arm .",
    "the scale free behavior of fluctuation power spectra of a variety of tracers ( h  i 21  cm emission intensity , dust emission ) is the main observational evidence for the existence of turbulence in the atomic ism .",

    "recently @xcite have reported that the h  i 21  cm intensity fluctuation power spectra for a sample of dwarf and nearby spiral galaxies have a power law index of @xmath17 and @xmath18 on scales respectively smaller and larger than the scale height of the galaxy disk .",
    "this is interpreted as the effect of a transition from three dimensional to two dimensional turbulence at scales larger than the disk thickness .",
    "the observed fractal structure of h  i in several dwarf galaxies in the m  81 group is also consistent with the self - similar hierarchical structure of the turbulent ism without any preferred length scale @xcite .    on the theoretical side , fine scale structure in the neutral gas",

    "@xcite show that in the case of small fluctuations of density , the dependence on temperature is small .",
    "turbulence however , gives rise to fluctuations in both the density and velocity of the gas and both of these contribute to the observed opacity fluctuations .",
    "@xcite show that the slope of the observed power spectrum changes depending on whether the h  i 21  cm emission is averaged over a velocity range that is large ( `` thick slices '' ) or small ( `` thin slices '' ) compared to the turbulent velocity dispersion . observations with high enough spectral resolution can hence disentangle the statistical properties of the velocity and the density fluctuations .",

    "a recently developed formalism for statistically robust extraction of the fluctuation power spectrum from interferometric data is used here to re - examine the issue and to constrain the h  i 21  cm opacity fluctuation power spectrum towards cas  a. this method is particularly useful because one can completely avoid the complications of deconvolution and imaging the strong background source .",

    "the fluctuations are also assumed to be statistically isotropic which implies that @xmath32 depends only on @xmath39 .",
    "the visibility @xmath40 measured in radio interferometric observations directly probes a fourier mode of the sky brightness fluctuation @xmath41 . here",
    "the inverse angular scale @xmath42 directly corresponds to a baseline , the antenna separation projected in the plane perpendicular to the direction of observation , measured in units of the observing wavelength @xmath43 .",

    "the fourier relation between @xmath40 and @xmath33 allows us to identify each baseline with an inverse angular scale , and to directly estimate the angular power spectrum from the measured visibilities .",
    "detailed discussions of the visibility based power spectral estimator that we use here can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , the estimator @xmath44 , is obtained by correlating every visibility @xmath40 with all other nearby visibilities @xmath45 , i.e. those which lie within the disk defined by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angular radius of the source . in the case of cas  a , @xmath48 , i.e. the angular radius of the source . since the fluctuations are assumed to be statistically isotropic , the correlations are averaged over different @xmath42 directions to obtain the final estimator . to increase the signal to noise ratio we further average the estimator in bins of @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite show that the expectation value of the estimator @xmath50 is the convolution of the power spectrum @xmath51 with a window function @xmath52 .",
    "the window function , which quantifies the effect of the finite angular extent of the source , is peaked around @xmath53 and has a width of order @xmath54 beyond which @xmath55 .",
    "for the optically thin shell - type geometry of cas  a the convolution does not effect the shape of the power spectrum beyond a baseline @xmath56  k@xmath43 @xcite , and we may directly interpret the real part of the estimator @xmath50 as the power spectrum @xmath51 .",
    "the estimator @xmath50 also has a small imaginary component arising mainly from noise .",
    "we compute the @xmath57 error bars for the estimated power spectrum by assuming the error to be the quadrature sum of contributions from two sources of uncertainty , viz .",
    "the sample variance and the system noise . at small @xmath49",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the sample variance which comes from the fact that we have a finite and limited number of independent estimates of the true power spectrum . at large @xmath49",
    ", it is dominated by the system noise in each visibility .",
    "the longest baseline in our observation ( @xmath58 km ) corresponds to an angular resolution of @xmath59 , but our power spectrum estimation is restricted to @xmath60  k@xmath43 ( angular scale @xmath61 ) because the larger baselines do not have an adequate signal to noise ratio . similarly for @xmath62  k@xmath43 ( angular scale @xmath63 ) the sample variance leads to large uncertainties in the power spectral estimate .",
    "note that since the estimator is local in @xmath49 , the estimate of the power spectrum over this specific range in @xmath49 is not affected by the missing zero spacing baselines or the cut - off at large @xmath49 .",
    "certainly these cut - offs and consequent gibbs phenomena will produce significant ringing and distortion in the image .",
    "however , since the power spectrum is estimated directly in the @xmath64 plane , our method , unlike image based techniques , has completely avoided these problems .",
    "figure [ fig : pk ] shows the estimated power spectrum for four different channels with h  i absorption features of different optical depth . note",
    "that since channel a has no h  i absorption , it just shows intensity fluctuations power spectrum of the background source cas  a. on the other hand , channel d has inadequate signal to noise to constrain the power spectrum due to very large optical depth .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath65 of the continuum emission from cas  a , seen in the channels without h  i absorption , has been studied in @xcite .",
    "this power spectrum is well fit by a broken power law @xmath66 which has been interpreted as arising from magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in this shell type supernova remnant .",

    "the sky brightness @xmath68 towards the extended source cas  a may be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the continuum radiation from cas  a and @xmath71 is the optical depth for absorption by intervening h  i. we expect @xmath70 and @xmath71 to be independent , whereby we can write @xmath72 both @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be decomposed into the sum of a constant average value and the fluctuation around that value ( as a function of @xmath73 ) @xmath74 and hence equation ( [ eqn : interm1 ] ) can be re - written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the autocorrelation function of continuum intensity fluctuation .",
    "further , we assume that the opacity fluctuation @xmath77 is a gaussian random field with zero mean , variance @xmath78 and autocorrelation function @xmath79 , whereby @xmath80 the opacity power spectrum @xmath81 , which is our main interest in this paper , is the fourier transform of @xmath79 .",
    "the power spectrum of the brightness fluctuations for a frequency channel with h  i absorption can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath65 is the power spectrum of brightness fluctuations of the continuum emission , i.e. the fourier transform of @xmath76 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : psf ] ) relates @xmath83 to the convolution of @xmath84 and @xmath85 which refer to the continuum and the h  i opacity respectively .",
    "it should be noted that while the terms @xmath83 , @xmath65 and @xmath85 are all functions of @xmath42 , the terms @xmath86 and @xmath87 do not have any @xmath42 dependence . in our analysis we have treated @xmath88 as a free parameter that determines the amplitude of @xmath83 .",
    "the terms @xmath89 and @xmath65 , that refer to the continuum radiation , are known from cas  a s total continuum flux density and analysis of the brightness fluctuations in the line free channels ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ eq : model ] ) respectively . the h  i opacity power spectrum @xmath90 , which is the quantity that we wish to determine in this analysis , enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : psf ] ) through the term @xmath91 .",
    "we have assumed that the opacity power spectrum is a power law @xmath92 under this assumption the brightness power spectrum @xmath32 is completely determined by three parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 . for each velocity channel that shows",
    "h  i absorption we have used standard chi - square minimization to determine the value of these three parameters for which our model prediction ( eqs . [ eq : psf ] and [ eq : ptau ] ) best fits the measured @xmath83 .",
    "the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 are not of particular interest in the present analysis . hence we derive only the best fit value of @xmath94 and marginalize over @xmath95 and @xmath96 to estimate errors for @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ fig : hips-2 ] shows the measured @xmath83 and the best fit model of @xmath83 for a single channel with h  i absorption .",
    "we find that our model , which assumes a power law h  i opacity power spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ptau ] ) , provides a good fit to the measured sky brightness power spectrum @xmath83 .",
    "the reduced chi - square values for the best fit model are , however , not close to @xmath97 but are about @xmath98 .",
    "this is most probably because of an overestimation of the errors in the measured @xmath83 .",
    "the estimated errors , for example , are found to be significantly more than the variation of the continuum power spectra across line free channels .",
    "it implies that the very conservative and approximate error estimates adopted here may result in a smaller value of the reduced chi - square even when the model represents the observed power spectrum quite well .",
    "hence , we have scaled down the errors of the observed @xmath83 so that the reduced chi - square is close to @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath57 errors of the power law index correspond to a change of the reduced chi - square by @xmath99 from its minimum value .",
    "intensity fluctuation power spectrum for a `` thin '' velocity channel with h  i absorption ( channel c marked in figure [ fig : hips-1 ] and figure [ fig : pk ] ) .",
    "the best fit model power spectrum is plotted with the data points . ]",
    "the velocity channels with very strong absorption do not have adequate signal to noise to constrain the power spectrum . on the other hand , for a few channels with dominant continuum signal and very weak h  i absorption , the power spectrum does not deviate significantly from the `` continuum '' power spectrum , making it hard to constrain the opacity spectrum .",
    "the optimal channels for this analysis are hence those with moderate h  i absorption , where there is still sufficient signal to noise ratio , and the total power spectrum has been significantly modified by the h  i absorption .",
    "we note that any image - based method of estimating the power spectrum will also be constrained to the same optimal channels by the signal to noise considerations mentioned here .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath94 is found to be @xmath100 ( @xmath5 error ) for the angular scale of @xmath101 probed in this observation .",
    "note that this error bar is based on the quadrature sum of the estimated noise due to `` cosmic variance '' and the signal to noise ratio on each visibility .",
    "as discussed above , this is likely to be an overestimate of the true error .",
    "consistent with this , the channel to channel variation of the best fit value of @xmath94 is much less than the estimated error of @xmath102 .",
    "computing the variance over independent estimates of @xmath94 derived for different velocity channels leads to @xmath103 ( @xmath5 error ) .",
    "we find no significant difference in @xmath94 between the velocity channels with absorption produced by gas from the perseus arm and from the local arm .",
    "the angular scales that our power spectral estimator is valid for corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath104  pc for the perseus arm ( for an assumed distance of 3 kpc to the arm ) .",
    "the local arm is @xmath14 pc wide in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "so , for the local arm , the upper limit of linear scale range ( adopting a distance of @xmath105 pc to the absorbing gas ) is @xmath106 pc ( @xmath107 au ) . we note that , for the local arm towards cygnus  a , @xcite have reported @xmath108 , an index somewhat shallower than what we find here , or what those authors find for the perseus arm and the outer arm .",
    "for the perseus arm towards cas  a , @xcite report @xmath109 ( @xmath5 error ) for a similar range of linear scales .",
    "this factor of @xmath110 smaller uncertainty in the current measurement is partly due to the better sensitivity of the present observations and partly due to using a more optimal estimator of the power spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath94 that we find here is also consistent with the value ( @xmath16 ) reported from the galactic h  i emission observations @xcite probing the scales of @xmath111  pc .    for power law opacity fluctuations power spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ptau ] ) with @xmath112 , the opacity fluctuation smoothed over a length - scale @xmath113 is predicted @xcite to have a rms @xmath114 which is also a power law .",
    "using our best fit model we have @xmath115 .",
    "extrapolating this power law , the rms opacity variation is @xmath116 on scales of @xmath105 au which is broadly consistent with recent vla and vlba studies @xcite .",
    "the present study of h  i absorption , combined with this result derived from h  i emission observations at larger linear scales indicates that there is no significant change in the slope of the power spectrum over @xmath117 orders of magnitude in linear scale .",
    "this spectrum is significantly shallower than the kolmogorov spectrum ( with power law index of @xmath118 ) expected from an incompressible turbulent medium @xcite .",
    "this may be because of the fact that the turbulence in h  i is compressible and magnetohydrodynamic in nature ( see * ? ? ? * for discussion on this issue ) .",
    "if the density fluctuation is small compared to the mean density , then for gas in pressure equilibrium , the slope of the opacity fluctuation power spectrum will be nearly the same as that of the density fluctuation power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , fluctuations in both the density and velocity fields contribute to the observed h  i opacity fluctuations .",
    "it can be shown that for the power spectrum estimated from `` thick slices '' , i.e. those with velocity width larger than the turbulent velocity dispersion , the contribution is only from the density fluctuations , and all velocity information get averaged out @xcite .",
    "so , for `` thick slices '' , the intensity fluctuation is dominantly due to density fluctuation and the observed power law index @xmath119 is expected to be same as the index of the density fluctuation power spectrum . on the other hand , for `` thin slices '' , the power law index of the observed power spectrum is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the power law index of the velocity structure function .",
    "hence , it is possible to decouple the density and velocity fluctuations from the power spectra derived from `` thin '' and `` thick '' velocity channels .",
    "@xcite reported a near - kolmogorov power law index for both density and velocity fluctuations power spectra for the milky way and the small magellanic cloud by applying this technique to the h  i emission data @xcite .",
    "for our data , we find that though there is a very weak trend of smaller @xmath94 for larger channel width , the observed change of @xmath94 by about @xmath122 for a change of velocity width from @xmath31 to @xmath123  km  s@xmath2 is within the @xmath124 error bar . since @xmath94 remains unchanged for `` thin slices '' with velocity width as small as @xmath125 km  s@xmath2 , i.e.  much smaller than the typical value of @xmath126  km  s@xmath2 for turbulent dispersion in galactic cold h  i @xcite , we can constrain @xmath121 to be @xmath127 ( @xmath5 error ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath128 predicted for turbulence in an incompressible medium @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have studied the h  i 21  cm opacity fluctuation towards cas  a. a simple but robust method of directly estimating the power spectrum from the observed visibilities is outlined . in this analysis",
    "we avoid the complications of imaging the bright , extended continuum source , of subtracting the continuum and of making optical depth image for channels with h  i absorption .",
    "we have found that the h  i opacity fluctuation power spectrum can be modelled as a power law with an index of @xmath129 ( @xmath5 error ) .",
    "this is consistent with earlier observational results .",
    "we have not found any significant difference of the power law index between velocity channels with absorption produced by the gas from the perseus arm and the local arm .",
    "we have also checked , by smoothing the visibility data for adjacent channels , if there is variation of the power law index with the velocity width of channels .",
    "it is found that , within the estimation errors , the power law index remains constant for a wide range of velocity widths .",
    "we can not , however , rule out contribution of velocity fluctuations to the observed opacity fluctuations if the power law index of the velocity structure function is @xmath127 ( @xmath5 error ) .",
    "we plan to apply , in future , this visibility based method to study the opacity fluctuations for other lines of sight in different regions of the galaxy .",
