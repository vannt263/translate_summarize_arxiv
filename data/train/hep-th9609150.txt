    "this paper extends our previous nonperturbative studies of quantum electrodynamics in three spacetime dimensions ( qed@xmath0 )  @xcite from scalar to vector positronium states .",
    "being a confining theory , the low energy behaviour of qed@xmath0 must be dealt with nonperturbatively .",
    "we consider qed@xmath0 to be a simple but effective testing ground for non - perturbative methods commonly applied to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd@xmath1 ) . again",
    "our approach is via a solution to the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) with fermion propagator input from the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) .",
    "we consider a numerically solvable system of integral equations within the quenched , ladder approximation for the bse and the quenched , rainbow approximation for the dse .",
    "it is well known that the combination of ladder bse and rainbow dse respects goldstone s theorem , i.e , in the chiral limit of zero current fermion mass , the spectrum admits a massless `` pion ''  @xcite .",
    "our four - component fermion version of qed@xmath0 admits a spontaneously broken chiral - like symmetry leading to a doublet of goldstone bosons .",
    "it is reasonable to expect therefore that the important effect of chiral symmetry breaking on the light bound state spectrum will be well modelled by this approximation .",
    "we note , however , that our truncation does break local gauge covariance .",
    "of particular concern is the effect of the rainbow approximation on the analytic structure of the fermion propagator .",
    "this approximation is known to generate ghost poles in the complex momentum plane in both qed@xmath1",
    "@xcite and qed@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "such poles can be an impediment to the bse formulated in euclidean space , which samples the fermion propagator over a region of the complex momentum plane  @xcite .",
    "herein we assume the position that , provided the ghost poles do not impinge upon this region of the complex plane , the rainbow - ladder approximation is a reasonable one .",
    "we acknowledge , however , that this point deserves further investigation .",
    "several qed@xmath0 studies  @xcite have examined the effect on the spacelike behaviour of the fermion propagator if the fermion - photon vertex is replaced by a more sophisticated ansatz satisfying the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "these studies find the spacelike behaviour to be qualitatively similar to that of the rainbow approximation .",
    "extension of these results to the remainder of the complex plane is beyond the scope of this current paper .",
    "we also note that any improvement in the fermion - photon vertex should be matched by a corresponding improvement in the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) kernel in such a way as to preserve goldstone s theorem .",
    "that this can in principle be achieved by consistently matching a loop expansion of the vertex with crossed diagrams in the bs kernel has recently been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the extension from scalar to vector states enriches considerably the spectrum of bound states .",
    "this facilitates an understanding of the importance of symmetry principles in determining the dynamics of the positronium spectrum , and allows analogies to be drawn with the meson spectrum of qcd@xmath1 .",
    "we find that there is a one to one correspondence between the classification of states in 4-component qed@xmath0 in terms of `` axial parity '' and charge conjugation on the one hand , and the conventional @xmath2 classification of charge neutral mesons in qcd@xmath1 on the other .",
    "we consider bare fermion mass ranging from zero to large values . for large fermion masses we are able to make contact with the non - relativistic limit .",
    "in this limit we extend our previous derivation of the schrdinger equation as a limit of the bse formalism to higher spin states , and observe spectrum degeneracies analogous to those of heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we look at the bethe - salpeter and dyson - schwinger approximations used and set out the method we employ to find the vector bound state masses .",
    "transformation properties in qed@xmath0 , with special attention given to the newly considered vector states , are discussed in appendix a. these transformation properties are necessary for understanding the structure of bethe - salpeter amplitudes , and classification of the vector bound states .",
    "the bethe - salpeter coupled integral equations for the vector states are given in appendix b. section iii describes the nonrelativistic limit for the vector states . in section iv numerical vector bethe - salpeter solutions are reported and comparisons are made with existing nonrelativistic limit calculations .",
    "the results are discussed and conclusions drawn in section v.",
    "as in previous work  @xcite , the bs kernel is the quenched ladder approximation kernel ( bare one - photon exchange ) . again , for convenience , we use feynman gauge and work with the euclidean metric .",
    "the bse can then be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the one fermion irreducible positronium - fermion - antifermion vertex with external legs amputated .",
    "the photon propagator @xmath5 in feynman gauge is @xmath6 .",
    "the fermion propagator @xmath7 is the solution to a truncated dse . for bare fermion mass @xmath8 this truncated dse ( the quenched rainbow approximation )",
    "is @xmath9 from here on we use the units @xmath10 allowable due to the fact that in the quenched approximation the bse and dse can be recast in terms of dimensionless momentum @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 .",
    "we write the fermion propagator in the following general form @xmath13 where the vector and scalar parts of the propagator are given by @xmath14 non - zero @xmath15 signals dynamical fermion mass generation in the massless limit .",
    "suitable analytic fits to @xmath16 and @xmath15 were found in earlier work  @xcite , namely @xmath17 @xmath18 the parameters @xmath19,@xmath20 ( functions of fermion mass ) were the result of fits to iterative solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ds ] ) and can be found in the aforementioned paper .",
    "the analytic properties of the propagator are summarised at the end of this section .    in order to solve the bse",
    "we must write it as a set of numerically tractable coupled integral equations . to do this , we write the bound state amplitude @xmath21 in its most general form",
    "consistent with the parity and charge conjugation of the required bound state , substitute it into the bse and project out the coefficient functions for the individual dirac components .",
    "the general vector vertex can be found in appendix a and the integral equations in appendix b.    the solution to the bse involves iteration of the eight coupled integral equations eq .",
    "( [ eq : ie ] ) .",
    "these equations can be written in the form of an eigenvalue problem .",
    "let @xmath22 then we have @xmath23 for a given test mass @xmath24 .",
    "this equation is solved for different test bound state masses until an eigenvalue @xmath25 is obtained .",
    "such an equation exists for each symmetry case ( vector @xmath26 , vector @xmath27 , axivector @xmath28 and axivector @xmath29 ) and for each fermion mass @xmath8 .",
    "the bse described in this section requires a fermion propagator input in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsef ] ) and this needs to be available over a region in the complex momentum plane defined by @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdef ] ) with @xmath31 and @xmath32 real .",
    "this is the region  @xcite @xmath33 the dse solution should be well behaved over @xmath34 . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have studied the analytical properties of the propagator and here we summarise briefly .",
    "conjugate poles exist where the factor @xmath35 appearing in the denominator of the fermion propagator is zero .",
    "@xcite lists the conjugate poles arising from the fits for each fermion mass and the corresponding maximum bound state masses allowed .",
    "the maximum @xmath24 allowed is the value for which the boundary of @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : region ] ) coincides with the conjugate poles as we should not allow the singularities to enter into the bse sampling region .",
    "if the singularities were to enter that region it would be necessary for compensating zeros to exist in the dirac coefficients ( ie : nodes in the wavefunction ) .",
    "note that the region boundary  ( [ eq : region ] ) is bound state mass @xmath24 dependent and thus one must take care as @xmath24 increases during the bound state search .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that both the dse solution and our spacelike fits eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) have conjugate singularities . for small bare fermion mass @xmath8",
    "we find that the fits reproduce well the position of singularities .",
    "however , as @xmath8 is increased beyond the scale @xmath10 of the model , the spacelike propagator functions @xmath16 and @xmath15 become quite level , and the propagator poles recede further into the timelike half of the complex plane . in this limit ,",
    "numerical propagator fits are unable to model accurately the important analytic pole structure in the timelike half of the @xmath36-plane .",
    "we therefore find our numerical bound state mass solutions contaminated by noise for @xmath37 .",
    "for this reason , the non - relativistic limit @xmath38 of the theory must be treated separately .",
    "in previous work  @xcite a nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath38 ) of the bse was derived for the scalar states of the positronium system . in this work",

    "we were left to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : nrv2 ] ) for possible positive and negative charge parity @xmath173 vector solutions .",
    "it was found that the @xmath170 solution did exist and had a mass increasing linearly in @xmath174 as did the smaller @xmath98 solutions .",
    "however , the @xmath159 solution mass did not level off to the same slope and appeared to have a strongly divergent mass in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "we interpret this by saying that there is no @xmath159 bound state , in agreement with the generalised pauli exclusion principle .",
    "although the 1-loop nonrelativistic masses can not be quantitatively compared with masses found with the rainbow propagator , we again point out that the results do contain useful qualitative information .",
    "we find that the ordering of the states in the nonrelativistic limit is @xmath170 ( @xmath169 ) followed by @xmath175 ( @xmath171 ) and then @xmath170 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "based on both the relativistic calculations and the nonrelativistic 1-loop exercise , it appears that it is energetically favourable for the scalars to have positive charge parity , and for the vectors to have negative charge parity , in agreement with the qcd@xmath1 meson analogy .",
    "we compare our relativistic integral equation results with those of existing qed@xmath0 schrdinger equation results .",

    "the @xmath183 1 curve can be seen to match up with one or more of @xmath159 , @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "we know from our nonrelativistic analysis that the @xmath175 ( axivector ) states are the only @xmath183 1 states and become degenerate in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "it therefore seems as though there is a surprisingly good match up between relativistic and nonrelativistic @xmath183 1 states .",
    "the lowest @xmath183 2 and the first excited @xmath169 curves should coincide with higher vector @xmath170 states but no such states were solved for in our relativistic bse treatment .",
    "also there is no nonrelativistic @xmath159 state to match up with the relativistic vector state with positive charge parity as shown in our nonrelativistic bse exercise and as predicted by the generalised pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we emphasise that the schr \" odinger equation results are of course formulated in the nonrelativistic limit and we can not expect close numerical agreement with the small mass relativistic results .",
    "in fact , there is quite a broad region of intermediate masses where neither the relativistic bse nor the schr \" odinger results are suitable .",
    "finally , we may make qualitative comparisons between the calculated spectrum of @xmath152 states in qed@xmath0 and the spectrum of observed @xmath2 meson states in qcd@xmath1 . since the observed meson spectrum is best established for light mesons , the comparison is made in the chiral limit @xmath184 . in table  [ tabmes ] we list the @xmath184 spectrum of scalar and axiscalar states from ref .",
    "@xcite , and of vector and axivector states from this work , together with the corresponding observed light meson states  @xcite .",
    "( note that , as pointed out in the previous section , the axial parity quantum number @xmath16 in @xmath99 dimensions plays the role of conventional parity @xmath185 in @xmath151 dimensions . )",
    "firstly we see that the gaps in the observed meson spectrum occur for parity combinations disallowed by the generalised pauli exclusion principle .",
    "in our fully relativistic qed@xmath0 calculations , there is nothing in principle to prevent such states from occurring away from the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "we are unable to say whether the unnatural parity solutions are a genuine property of qed@xmath0 , or an artefact of the rainbow , ladder approximation . if these states are ignored , we observe surprising agreement between the ordering and relative magnitudes of bound state masses in qed@xmath0 and the observed meson spectrum . in both cases",
    "the dynamics of the bound state spectrum is driven mainly by confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , these being the common features of qed@xmath0 and qcd@xmath1 .",
    "we have extended our earlier study of the positronium states of 4-component qed@xmath0 from scalar to vector states .",
    "qed@xmath0 is a confining theory , and the positronium states are in some sense the analogues of mesons in qcd@xmath1 . in @xmath99 dimensions",
    "the bound states are classified as eigenstates of reflection parity @xmath185 , axial parity @xmath16 ( i.e. a spatial rotation through @xmath186 ) , and charge conjugation @xmath177 . in the four component version of massless qed@xmath0",
    ", a @xmath187 symmetry analogous to chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath188 .",
    "the resulting spectrum consists of reflection parity doublets for which @xmath185 is an exact symmetry .",
    "the states are therefore classified by the quantum numbers @xmath152 .",
    "we had previously studied in detail axiscalar ( @xmath189 ) and scalar ( @xmath190 ) positronium .",
    "herein our focus is mainly on the extension of this work to vector ( @xmath191 ) and axivector ( @xmath192 ) states .",
    "we calculate bound state masses using the combination of rainbow dyson - schwinger and ladder bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "fermion propagators calculated for spacelike momenta from the dyson - schwinger equation are extended into the required part of the complex momentum plane by making analytic fits to the spacelike part of the propagator .",
    "there are two important issues raised by this extrapolation procedure , both of which we addressed for the scalar case in our previous work .",
    "firstly , the solution to the rainbow approximation dyson - schwinger equation , and the analytic fits , contain ghost poles in the timelike half of the complex momentum plane .",
    "it is necessary for the success of the approximation that these poles do not impinge on the set of complex momentum values sampled by the bse . as for the scalar case considered previously , we find that the vector states do not pose a problem in this regard .",
    "this is because the scalar and vector bound state masses are typically of comparable size over the range of bare fermion masses considered .",
    "secondly , in both the scalar and vector cases , the extrapolation procedure is inadequate for intermediate or large bare fermion masses ( viz .",
    "@xmath193 ) .",
    "this is because the important contributions to the bse in the heavy fermion limit come from deep into the timelike part of the complex plane .",
    "for this reason the heavy fermion limit must be treated separately .",
    "we have obtained numerical solutions to the combination of dyson - schwinger and bethe - salpeter equations over a range of dimensionless bare fermion masses @xmath12 for each of the axial and charge parity combinations @xmath170 , @xmath159 , @xmath161 and @xmath160 .",
    "solutions exist over the broad range of bare fermion masses considered except for the @xmath161 , for which the eigenvalue of the integral operator in the bse becomes complex for @xmath194 .",
    "we interpret this as a shortcoming of the rainbow - ladder approximation .    in our previous work we obtained the nonrelativistic ( i.e. @xmath38 ) limit of the bse for scalar and axiscalar states in the form of a schrdinger equation . here",
    "we have extended the proof to vector and axivector states in a way which enables us to identify the orbital angular momentum of each state .",
    "we find that the relation @xmath195 is automatically satisfied , and are furthermore able to restrict the allowed charge parities by using the generalised pauli exclusion principle . in this limit",
    "it becomes clear that it is axial parity , and not space reflection parity , which is the qed@xmath0 counterpart of conventional parity in qcd@xmath1 .",
    "we also find that in the nonrelativistic limit , the bound state spectrum becomes insensitive to the spin of constituent fermions .",
    "this is manifested as a degeneracy between @xmath196 and @xmath170 states and between the @xmath197 and @xmath175 states .",
    "precisely the same phenomenon occurs in the observed heavy meson spectrum to within order of the inverse heavy quark mass , and can be explained in terms of heavy quark effective theory  @xcite .",
    "while certain @xmath152 combinations are disallowed by the generalised pauli exclusion principle in the nonrelativistic limit , there is nothing in principle to prevent their occurrence in the relativistic regime .",
    "we have in fact obtained unnatural parity solutions in both our earlier scalar and current vector positronium calculations .",
    "this is not in agreement with the observed meson spectrum , even for light quark mesons , where for instance negative charge parity scalar or pseudoscalar mesons are never observed .",
    "one is led to question whether the unnatural parity solutions in qed@xmath0 are an artefact of the rainbow - ladder approximation .",
    "more importantly we find that , if the unnatural parity solutions are ignored , there is surprising agreement between the relative mass scales of calculated @xmath152 states in qed@xmath0 and observed @xmath2 mesons in qcd@xmath1 , as evidenced in table  [ tabmes ] .",
    "the original aim of studying 4-component qed@xmath0 was to explore nonperturbatively a theory which has properties in common with qcd@xmath1 , namely confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , but without the complications of being nonabelian .",
    "we have demonstrated that the bethe - salpeter formalism generates a bound state spectrum with qualitative characteristics in common with the observed meson spectrum .",
    "one shortcoming of the rainbow - ladder formalism is that gauge covariance is broken by using a bare fermion - photon vertex . in any practical truncation",
    "it is likely that some symmetry of the original problem will be lost . in this paper",
    "we have adopted the position that it is more important for bound state mass calculations to maintain the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism than to maintain gauge symmetry .",
    "an alternative approach is that of lattice gauge theory , in which gauge symmetry is maintained , but the original chiral symmetry of qed@xmath0 survives only as a small remnant subgroup  @xcite .",
    "specifically , lattice gauge theory simulations of quenched , non - compact qed3 with 4-component fermions can be carried out with comparative ease  @xcite , and the chiral condensate checked against the predictions of model dyson - schwinger calculations  @xcite .",
    "we are unaware of any existing bound state spectrum calculation of this simple lattice model .",
    "such a calculation would provide a much needed cross check between two vastly differing non - perturbative field theory methods .",
    "solution to the bse in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) for the vector states requires a general vertex function which will allow individual dirac components to be projected out leaving a system of coupled integral equations .",
    "we assume a knowledge of the transformation properties of qed@xmath0  @xcite and of the scalar bs amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "we work in the four - component version of qed@xmath0 where there exists a complete set of 16 matrices ( where @xmath198 = 0 , 1 and 2 ) @xmath199 satisfying @xmath200 .",
    "these matrices can be found in ref .",
    "the qed@xmath0 action is invariant with respect to discrete parity and charge conjugation symmetries , which for the fermion fields are given by @xmath201 @xmath202 where @xmath203 .",
    "the parity and charge conjugation matrices ( @xmath204 and @xmath177 respectively ) are each determined up to an arbitrary phase by the condition that the action be invariant  @xcite : @xmath205    vector , pseudovector , axivector and axipseudovector bound states are defined by the following transformation properties under parity transformations @xmath206 where @xmath207 and in minkowski space @xmath208 .",
    "similar transformation properties exist for charge conjugation .",
    "we also find the need to classify our nonrelativistic states in terms of the transformation properties under what we call `` axial parity '' which is the ( 2 + 1)d analogue of the ( 3 + 1)d parity where @xmath209 .",
    "the fermion fields transform like @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the operator which corresponds to a rotation through angle @xmath132 in the @xmath212 plane .",
    "we find that a suitable operator @xmath211 which performs such a rotation and leaves the action invariant is the matrix @xmath213 .",
    "this is the same operator as used in the ( 3 + 1)d case .",
    "the phase @xmath214 is responsible for making @xmath215 and has no effect on the transformation of bilinear currents of concern here . given that the bound state wavefunctions transform like the bilinear currents @xmath216 we find the following transformation properties for scalars and vectors under axial parity .",
    "@xmath217    the matrix @xmath218 is defined as @xmath219 .",
    "the corresponding axial parities ( @xmath220 ) for each state are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this definition parallels the ( 3 + 1)d case where a vector state transforms like @xmath221 and is assigned negative parity .",
    "let us now derive a general vector vertex .",
    "consider the momentum @xmath222 which transforms like @xmath223 under parity .",
    "the bound state momentum @xmath224 seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) is another such vector .",
    "three other vectors can be found which transform in this way which are @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the vectors @xmath228 and @xmath229 used in previous work  @xcite are mutually orthogonal with @xmath185 and are defined as @xmath230 the proof that these vectors transform like @xmath231 is simple using the knowledge that a vector @xmath232 transforms under parity like @xmath233 and that the five matrices @xmath225 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 form an anticommuting set and @xmath236 .",
    "so we have a set of five vectors with even parity .",
    "a linear combination of @xmath185 and @xmath237 can be found which gives @xmath231 and so it is not required .",
    "the four vectors we work with are thus @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "any other available vectors even in parity would be linear combinations of these .",
    "a massive boson of spin 1 will have a purely transverse wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "thus the vector vertex will be purely transverse .",
    "this zero divergence criterion in momentum space means that @xmath238",
    ". we must find linear combinations of the four vectors above which are all purely transverse .",
    "only three can be found which are @xmath239 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "it therefore appears as though the most general vector @xmath240 we can write which is even under parity and purely transverse is a sum of these quantities , each multiplied by the most general scalar vertex  @xcite .",
    "the result is an expression with twelve terms and with twelve parameters .",
    "however , some terms have been included more than once .",
    "it can be shown that four of the twelve terms can be eliminated leaving the general vector vertex @xmath241 where @xmath242 ( @xmath24318 ) are functions of @xmath244 and @xmath245 only .",
    "the pseudovector ( pv ) , axivector ( av ) and axipseudovector ( apv ) vertices are given by @xmath246    for a specified charge parity @xmath89 of a bound state , the parity of the dirac coefficients ( @xmath242 ) under the transformation @xmath247 can be determined .",
    "the quantity @xmath245 is the only lorentz invariant which changes sign under charge conjugation and thus determines the charge parity of those functions .",
    "table  [ tab5 ] lists the charge parities of each function for each case .",
    "we can see from this table that multiplying the vector vertex by @xmath248 ( and thus producing the pseudovector vertex ) leaves the function charge parities unchanged but multiplying the axivector vertex by @xmath248 ( producing the axipseudovector vertex ) reverses the function charge parities .",
    "we know that the same bse results when we multiply the vertex @xmath249 by @xmath248 .",
    "this means that the vector @xmath29 and pseudovector @xmath29 states are degenerate as are the vector @xmath28 and pseudovector @xmath28 states .",
