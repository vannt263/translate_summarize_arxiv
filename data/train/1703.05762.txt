    "x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are gravitationally interacting binaries in which a stellar remnant accretes matter from its companion .",
    "the term xrb is often used for binaries in which the accretor is a neutron star or black hole , and here we will apply it as well to binaries in which the accretor is a white dwarf .",
    "we include both cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , in which the white dwarf accretes from a close low - mass companion , and symbiotics , in which the donor is a giant .",
    "we consider the possibility that some xrbs host planetary systems , and we present a method to discover planets orbiting within or around such interacting binaries .",
    "planets in binaries may be common . at the time of this writing ,",
    "roughly 70 examples are known of planets orbiting one member of a binary ( e.g. , butler et al .",
    "1997 ; cochran et al . 1997 ; roell et al .",
    "2012 ) , and more than a dozen cases are known in which the planet orbits both members ( e.g. , thorsett et al . 1999 ; doyle et al .",
    "2011 ; hinse et al .",
    "2015 , orosz et al .",
    "2016 ) . following the terminology of dvorak ( 1986 ) ,",
    "these two types of systems are s - type and p - type , respectively .",
    "the first known p - type system consists of a planet orbiting a pulsar and a white dwarf and was detected from observed changes in the travel time of the radio pulses ( thorsett et al .",
    "this system passed through an epoch as an x - ray binary , during which the giant progenitor of today s white dwarf transferred mass to the neutron star , spinning it up . here",
    "we consider how to search for planets in active mass - transfer systems .",
    "planets have also been discovered in p - type orbits around binaries which _ will become _ cvs during their next evolutionary phase ( e.g. , hw vir , lee et al . 2009 ; beuermann et al . 2012 ; dp leo , qian et al . 2010 ; nn ser , beuermann et al .",
    "these binaries are referred to as _ pre - cvs _ or _ post - common - envelope _ binaries .",
    "pre - cvs contain a white dwarf which is the remnant of a giant that filled its roche lobe under circumstances inconsistent with dynamically stable mass transfer .",
    "the giant s envelope was transformed into a common envelope within which the white dwarf and its stellar companion spiraled closer to each other , but did not merge .",
    "eventually , the white dwarf s companion will fill its roche lobe , and the binary will become a cv .",
    "if the planet is retained , it will be in orbit with an x - ray binary .    since planets have been found in p - type orbits both prior to and after the binary is an xrb",
    ", it is clearly important to consider planets during the xrb phase .",
    "planets in s - type orbits around accreting compact objects or companion donor stars may also be present , especially in wider binaries , where mass transfer may proceed through winds .",
    "those planets not destroyed by mass transfer may transit the compact object and portions of its accretion disk , potentially causing detectable x - ray eclipses .",
    "the same considerations apply , whether the accretor is a white dwarf , neutron star , or black hole .",
    "x - ray light curves provide ideal opportunities to search for transits , because the sizes of the x - ray emitting regions in many xrbs are so small that the passage of a planet produces a sharply - defined total eclipse .",
    "for example , x - ray emission from black holes can be dominated by a soft ( @xmath0 kev ) component emanating primarily from the inner portion of an accretion disk , which may have an extent of only tens or hundreds of kilometers ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "x - rays from neutron stars may also emerge from very small regions . in certain states ,",
    "emission from a white dwarf emanates from an area comparable to its surface area , so that an earth - size planet could cause a deep eclipse , and somewhat larger planets could produce total eclipses .",
    "this would apply to a white dwarf in a supersoft state ( e.g. , van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ) , or post - nova , and also to some magnetic cvs ( e.g. , nucita et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the question of detectability hinges on whether the number of photons missing due to the eclipse is large enough that the deficit and its duration can be reliably measured .",
    "if reliable detection can not be made during a single transit , then the signal could possibly be identified through repeated transits , if the orbital period is short enough .",
    "the challenges are similar to those that have been successfully met by analyses of data from the _ kepler _ mission , which has identified earth - size and even smaller planets orbiting sun - like stars .",
    "the x - ray data analyses we advocate would take place in a complementary part of the discovery parameter space : the x - ray transits are deeper , in some cases total eclipses ; the background is small or nonexistent , eliminating problems of blending with light from nearby stars ; and the numbers of x - ray photons are small .",
    "the paucity of x - ray photons is a new challenge which provides a lower bound on the baseline count rate relative to the eclipse time scale and the total exposure time ( see  4 ) . nevertheless , if planets orbit within or around xrbs , then detectability is possible for many systems .",
    "x - ray binaries are also copious emitters of optical light . in cases in which the optical emission , like the x - ray emission , emanates from a small region , optical transits may also be detected .",
    "ht cas and oy car are examples of cvs in which both optical and x - ray eclipses have been studied ( horne et al .",
    "1991 ; thorstensen et al . 2008 ; nucita et al . 2009 ; wood et al .",
    "1989 ; wheatley & west 2003 ) . in many xrbs",
    ", however , the sources of optical emission can be complex and extended .",
    "the donor star and outer regions of the accretion disk can both contribute to or dominate the optical emission , diluting the effects of stellar or planetary transits .",
    "in these cases , x - rays may provide the best route to planet detection . moreover , the detection of transits in two widely separated wavebands increases confidence in the interpretation that the dips are related to the passage of a solid body .",
    "in addition , different wavebands reveal complementary aspects of the emission during mass transfer .",
    "periodic pulsations , like those emanating from millisecond pulsars , can reveal the presence of planets through radio timing measurements . as with optical observations , combining information across wavebands is an exciting prospect .",
    "we demonstrate that planets may produce detectable x - ray eclipses .",
    "we consider two extremes of planet masses and sizes , from earth- to jupiter - sized .",
    "our main goals are ( 1 ) to examine the parameter space of stable orbits for planets in xrbs ; ( 2 ) to study the expected light curve characteristics ; and ( 3 ) to consider which xrbs would likely be most profitable to study with our approach .    in section [ sec : stability ] , we present the equations for investigating the stability limits of planets orbiting xrbs , with a specific focus on cvs .",
    "we provide examples of theoretical transiting light curves in section [ sec : light_curves ] .",
    "we address the issue of detectability and consider the properties of xrbs that are the most promising targets for light curve analysis in section [ sec : discussion ] . in section [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions and discuss the implications of our work .",
    "our goal in this section is to explore a realistic range within the parameter space of stable orbits for planets in xrbs . for simplicity , we restrict our considerations to single planets in circular , coplanar orbits .",
    "an illustration of a planet orbiting and transiting the compact accretor of an xrb is shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "stability in triple systems generally requires a hierarchical structure , with the outer orbit being at least a few times larger than the inner orbit .",
    "thus , for p - type ( or , circumbinary ) orbits , there is a critical value , @xmath1 , for the semimajor axis of the planetary orbit in terms of the separation @xmath2 between the components of the binary .",
    "holman & weigert ( 1999 ) determined an expression for @xmath1 by conducting numerical simulations of test particles moving in the gravitational field of binaries : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the orbital eccentricity , which will generally be zero in the mass transfer binaries we consider .",
    "the binary mass ratio is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of primary , and @xmath7 is the mass of its stellar companion . in our case , without loss of generality , we define the primary to be the compact accretor .",
    "this equation applies over the range @xmath8 ( holman & weigert 2009 ) . for @xmath9",
    "the orbit is stable .",
    "lc + symbol & variable definition + @xmath10 & mass of primary ( donor ) star + @xmath11 & radius of primary ( donor ) star + @xmath12 & planet mass + @xmath13 & planet radius + @xmath14 & mass ratio : @xmath15 + @xmath16 & @xmath17 + @xmath18 & planet - to - primary size ratio : @xmath19 + @xmath2 & semi - major axis of binary + @xmath20 & critical semi - major axis of planetary orbit + @xmath21 & orbital period of planetary orbit + @xmath22 & eccentricity , impact parameter , inclination + @xmath23 & tidal disruption radius + @xmath24 & full duration time of transit + @xmath25 & total duration time of transit + @xmath26 & ingress / egress time of transit + @xmath27 & transit depth +    [ table1 ]    it is also possible for the planet to be located within the binary orbit . in this case ,",
    "holman & weigert ( 2009 ) find that the critical orbital radius of an s - type planet , @xmath28 is @xmath29 equation ( [ eq : outer ] ) is valid to within 36% over the range @xmath30 , and equation ( [ eq : inner ] ) is valid to within 411% for @xmath31 .",
    "the variables used in the above equations and the rest of this paper are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the specific values we derive for the innermost and outermost stable orbits are not expected to represent exact results for all planets in binaries , because some of the input assumptions may not be satisfied .",
    "for example , the orbits may not be coplanar , there may be a distant third star , multiple planets , or the process of mass transfer may alter the results somewhat .",
    "nevertheless , the general result should be robust : the planetary and stellar orbits must be hierarchical , with the semimajor axis of a stable planetary orbit differing from the semimajor axis of the binary orbit by a factor of a few .        when mass transfer occurs because the donor fills its roche lobe , the binary s orbital separation is set by the condition that the radius of the donor , @xmath32 , equals the size of its roche lobe , @xmath33 . using the function derived by eggleton ( 1983 ) , we have : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : a_vs_mu ] , we display the binary separation of xrbs as a function of @xmath14 , for a fixed accretor mass of @xmath36 , corresponding to a white dwarf .",
    "we consider a case in which a main - sequence donor , with @xmath37 , fills its roche lobe .",
    "the orbits are circular ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the plot also shows the critical semimajor axes for a single planet .",
    "we show both outer ( @xmath39 ; dotted line ) and inner ( @xmath40 ; dashed line ) critical orbits .",
    "overplotted are data points from zorotovic et al .",
    "( 2011 ) of binary separations for real cvs .",
    "there are no cvs on the upper right portion of the curve because mass transfer becomes unstable when the donor is much more massive than the accretor .",
    "the cvs depart from our curve on the lower left because the low - mass donors in these systems are degenerate and have larger radii than would be given by the extrapolation of the radius - mass relation for main - sequence stars .",
    "we note that the orbital separation can be significantly larger in mass transfer binaries .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is generally @xmath41 times the radius of the donor , when the donor fills its roche lobe .",
    "thus , when the donor is a subgiant or giant , @xmath2 is larger than in the main - sequence case we have shown .",
    "in addition , mass transfer is often effected through winds . the winds can be driven by radiation from the accretor or else may be generated by a highly evolved donor . in these cases , the separation is larger than it would be for roche - lobe - filling systems .",
    "another factor that must be taken into account is the value of the mass ratio , since large values are associated with mass transfer that is unstable on dynamical time scales . for mass transfer mediated by winds , there is not a fixed analytic limit on the mass ratio , since larger mass ratios are allowed if much of the mass lost from the donor exits the system carrying only a small amount of angular momentum per unit mass . for mass transfer that occurs through the l1 lagrange point",
    ", the limit depends on the evolutionary state of the donor , the fraction of the mass it loses that is ejected from the system , and the amount of angular momentum carried by ejected mass . the critical mass ratio for stability may have values somewhat smaller than unity , although values as large as @xmath42 can apply to main - sequence donors ( e.g. , ivanova 2015 ) .    a planet that ventures too close to a white dwarf or",
    "other compact object would not be able to survive disruption by tidal forces .",
    "the tidal disruption radius ( the roche limit ) is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are the mass densities of the planet and of earth , respectively .",
    "tidal forces present a challenge for the survival of inner orbit ( s - orbit ) planets .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tidal ] , we show the orbital parameters for several roche - lobe filling binaries . each panel shows the critical inner semimajor axis , @xmath45 , as a function of donor mass .",
    "we show plots for four different values of the primary star s mass , @xmath46 , 1.4 , 10 , and 50 @xmath47 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line marks the tidal radius for an earth - density planet , ( @xmath48 , and a jupiter - density planet , ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus , for instance , a jupiter - density planet in an xrb with a primary of mass @xmath50 ( top panel ) would be ripped apart for binary orbital separations less than @xmath51 .",
    "an earth - density planet in such a system could not survive orbital separations less than @xmath52 .    these plots",
    "illustrate several key points .",
    "first , as the formula for @xmath23 indicates , survival is more likely for planets of higher density .",
    "second , for accretors with masses in the range expected for white dwarfs and neutron stars , we do not expect to find stable s - type orbits if the donor star fills its roche lobe .",
    "thus , neither cvs nor low - mass x - ray binaries with neutron - star accretors are likely to have planets in stable s - type orbits .",
    "it is only for accretors of higher mass that we can find stable s - type orbits for binaries in which the donor is less massive than the accretor , ensuring the dynamical stability of mass transfer .",
    "in fact , the discovery of a planet in an s - type orbit may place lower bounds on the accretor s mass , something very useful in the study of black holes .",
    "the above results do not rule out s - type orbits in mass transfer binaries .",
    "first , when the donor is larger , either a subgiant or giant , the orbital separation is larger even when the donor fills its roche lobe .",
    "second , when mass transfer occurs through winds , the orbit can be even larger .",
    "when the stellar orbits are wide , planets can orbit around either or both stars as well as around both .",
    "to model the transit light curves , we need to assess the duration and the ingress / egress times of transits for a set of orbital parameters .",
    "a cartoon illustration of a transit in figure [ fig : cartoon ] shows that , for a non - grazing eclipse , the stellar and planetary disks touch at four contact times @xmath53@xmath54 .",
    "( for a grazing eclipse , the second and third contacts do not take place . ) the transit duration @xmath24 and ingress / egress duration @xmath26 depend on the planet period , @xmath21 , the radius of the primary star , @xmath55 , the radius of the planet , @xmath13 , the impact parameter , @xmath56 , and the inclination , @xmath57 . for a circular orbit , the total duration , @xmath58 , and full duration , @xmath59 ,",
    "are given by ( e.g. , winn 2010 ) , @xmath60,\\ ] ] @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
    "the ingress and egress durations , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are usually unequal for eccentric orbits , though the difference is minor in practice . here , since we consider only circular orbits , we take @xmath64 , and thus @xmath65 in many xrbs , the source of x - rays is a small region .",
    "it could for example be the inner accretion disk of a black hole or of a neutron star .",
    "in such cases the duration of the eclipse is determined by the amount of time it takes for the planet to cross this very small region . in the case where the primary is a white dwarf of mass @xmath6",
    ", the size of the x - ray - emitting region can be close to the size of the white dwarf ( e.g. , nucita et al .",
    "2009 ) , @xmath55 , which is determined by the white dwarf mass - radius relation : @xmath66 .",
    "the orbital period of the planet is simply derived using kepler s third law , @xmath67 where @xmath12 is the planet mass , and @xmath20 is determined from equations ( [ eq : outer ] ) or ( [ eq : inner ] ) for outer or inner orbits , respectively . for inner orbits around the primary star , @xmath68 would refer to the mass of the primary star alone . for outer orbits , however , the planet circles the combined mass of the primary and donor star , so @xmath69 . we consider earth - mass and jupiter - mass planets .",
    "figure [ fig : period ] shows the planetary period for outer and inner orbits as a function of @xmath14 for a cv in which the primary is a 0.8 @xmath47  white dwarf . because @xmath14 varies and @xmath6 is fixed , this is equivalent to plotting the period for a range of donor masses , @xmath70 . since @xmath71 ,",
    "the periods of earth- and jupiter - mass planets are essentially equal .",
    "recall that we have derived the period for values of the _ critical _ semimajor axis , within which planetary orbits are unstable .",
    "but orbits greater than @xmath20 are also permissible , and therefore the periods we calculate should be considered lower limits for a given @xmath68 . in figure",
    "[ fig : period ] , we overplot the periods of potential planets in circumbinary ( cb ) orbits around the zorotovic et al .",
    "( 2011 ) sample of cvs . using the measured masses of the binary members to define @xmath14",
    ", we calculate the periods assuming the planets are in stable orbits at the critical semimajor axis , @xmath72 .",
    "these calculations suggest that the periods of cb planets around xrbs may be as short as a few to tens of hours .    for completeness",
    ", we plot the period for inner orbits in figure [ fig : period ] as well , though based on the analysis of the tidal disruption radius in  [ sec : stability ] , such orbits may be physically implausible in cvs and other low - mass xrbs .",
    "figure [ fig : time_outer ] plots the full duration and ingress / egress transit times versus @xmath14 for both earth- and jupiter - mass planets orbiting outside the binary .",
    "again , we show the scenario where the primary mass is fixed to that of a 0.8 @xmath47  white dwarf . and we focus our attention on simplified cases where the orbit is coplanar and the planet transits directly across the equator of the primary , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "the general trend is for both transit and ingress / egress durations to increase with binary mass ratio , @xmath14 .",
    "this is because as either the primary or donor mass increases , the orbit at which a planet is stable is pushed further outward , corresponding to an increase in the orbital period .",
    "small planets are expected to have short transit durations , on the order of a few seconds , and comparatively longer ingress / egress times , because their sizes are comparable to the sizes of white dwarfs ( @xmath74 ) . due to their similar sizes , a small planet will spend relatively little time fully covering the stellar disk and a longer time crossing the edge of the stellar disk ( ingress / egress ) .",
    "the inverse is true for larger , jupiter - like planets , which have long transit durations , on the order of several minutes , and comparatively shorter ingress / egress times .",
    "jupiter , for instance , is about 8.5 times larger than the 0.01 @xmath75 white dwarf in the ht cas binary observed by horne et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and nucita et al .",
    "because white dwarfs ( and other compact objects ) are so small , the ingress / egress times of both small and large planets should be comparable .",
    "simulated transit light curves for earth- and jupiter - mass planets in cb ( p - type ) orbits around cvs with different mass ratios @xmath14 are shown in figures [ fig : transit1 ] and [ fig : transit2 ] .",
    "the orbits are circular and have no inclination . in figure",
    "[ fig : transit1 ] , the white dwarf mass varies ( @xmath76 , 0.8 , 1 , and 1.2 @xmath47 ) in each of the panels , while the donor mass remains fixed at @xmath77 . in figure",
    "[ fig : transit2 ] , the white dwarf mass is fixed at @xmath78 @xmath47  in each of the panels , while the donor mass varies ( @xmath79 , 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1 @xmath47 ) . in each plot in figures [ fig : transit1][fig : transit2 ] , the critical semimajor axis of the planet , ( which depends on the mass ratio of the binary ) , sets the orbital period and therefore the transit duration .",
    "in this section , we discuss the signatures we might expect in the light curves of cb planets in mass - transfer binary systems . in figure [ fig : transit1 ] we plot light curves for a set of cvs in which the mass of the donor stays fixed at 0.1 @xmath47 , and the white dwarf mass increases from 0.6 @xmath47  to near the chandrasekhar limit at 1.2 @xmath47 . as the white dwarf mass increases , @xmath14 decreases , and therefore the transit duration becomes increasingly short .",
    "the transit depth , @xmath80 , for earth - like planets gets deeper as @xmath6 increases , while jupiter - like planets entirely eclipse the white dwarf for all mass ratios .",
    "the former effect is due to the decrease in white dwarf size with increasing mass , according to the relationship @xmath66 . as the size of the white dwarf decreases",
    " assuming the size of the x - ray emitting region in the cv is comparable in size to the white dwarf  an earth - like ( or larger ) planet is capable of blocking out increasingly more of the flux , giving rise to deeper transit depths .",
    "for @xmath76 , an earth - like planet would block @xmath81 of the x - ray flux for a few seconds , while for @xmath82 , it would block roughly 95% of the flux for less time .",
    "if we now consider cvs in which the white dwarf mass is fixed at a typical value of 0.8 @xmath47  and the donor mass increases , we find that the transit durations become increasingly longer , most noticeable for large , jupiter - like planets ( figure [ fig : transit2 ] ) . for a cv in which @xmath83 and @xmath84 , a jupiter - like planet would eclipse the white dwarf for roughly 4 minutes .",
    "if instead , @xmath85 , a jupiter would cover the white dwarf for roughly 9 minutes .",
    "this trend is due to the increasing @xmath20 , which increases with the mass ratio of the binary . for smaller planets ,",
    "the transit depth @xmath86 remains fixed for all mass ratios ; that is , roughly 68% of the x - ray flux would be blocked out by an earth - like planet orbiting a cv with a 0.8 @xmath47  white dwarf .",
    "we note that for small , earth - like planets , the duration over which the transit is deepest can be very short , lasting only a few seconds ( see figure [ fig : time_outer ] ) .",
    "this might raise doubts as to the possibility of detecting such small planets around xrbs .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the ingress / egress durations of small planets are longer , around @xmath8745 seconds .",
    "thus , the entire time scale of such a transit ( @xmath88 ) will be @xmath89 minute , an interval over which there could plausibly be detectable effects .",
    "for any given xrb with transiting planets , the identification of transits depends on ( 1 )  the baseline , i.e. , the out - of - eclipse background - subtracted count rate of the source , @xmath90 ; ( 2 )  the duration , @xmath91 , of the occultation ; and ( 3 )  the depth of the occultation .",
    "the depth of the occultation depends on the relative surface areas of the source and planet , as well as on the inclination of their orbit .",
    "let @xmath92 be the area of the source which is covered by the planet at some time @xmath93 after the first contact has been made and before the last contact is made .",
    "the average value of the area covered is @xmath94 .",
    "the number of counts `` missing '' during the transit is then @xmath95\\bigg\\}\\ ,    \\times \\delta\\ , t,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the size of the x - ray - emitting region .",
    "exact expressions for @xmath91 , which include the geometrical effects , are given in   2 .",
    "here we express @xmath91 simply as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the orbital speed during the eclipse , and @xmath99 is an effective radius .",
    "@xmath100 where @xmath68 is the total mass enclosed by the orbit , and @xmath101 is the radius of jupiter . in the limit of a small source and/or a large planet ,",
    "@xmath99 may be taken to be the radius of the planet , @xmath13 . more generally , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a number ( generally @xmath104 ) which takes into account orientation and ingress / egress effects .",
    "equation ( [ eq : counts ] ) shows that , for a given count rate , more counts are missed during a transit for larger orbital separation and smaller total mass .",
    "these same factors yield longer orbital periods , however , producing fewer opportunities to detect additional transits that could validate the interpretation that a dip in the count rate was associated with a transit .",
    "thus , for any given system , there is an optimal compromise between larger @xmath2 and smaller @xmath68 , which promotes the detection of a single passage , and smaller @xmath2 and larger @xmath68 , which may make it possible to detect multiple transits .    to set scales relevant for the analysis of archived data , we consider the distribution of background - subtracted count rates obtained during observations with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( wang et al . 2016 ) .",
    "there were 772,000 x - ray states were found , and roughly 1000 ( 6000 , 21,000 ) of them exhibited count rates larger than 1 s@xmath105 ( 0.1 s@xmath105 , 0.01 s@xmath105 ) .",
    "many sources were detected multiple times , so that the total number of distinct _ states _ observed is about @xmath106 times larger than the total number of distinct sources . ] many of the x - ray sources producing these states are xrbs . with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory , count rates of the same sources",
    "would generally be several times larger , depending on the observational set up ( snowden 2002 ) .",
    "however , the number of background counts per unit time would also be larger .    for the highest count rates , a total eclipse lasting a minute would be readily detected ; for the lowest of these count rates , the passage might have to last for tens of minutes to assure the reliable detection of a single planetary passage .",
    "repeated transits could be detected , allowing better analysis of the dips , if the total exposure time , generally comprised of a sum of exposure times from separate observations , encompasses multiple orbits .",
    "some regions of the sky contain specific individual xrbs of high interest ( e.g. , black hole candidates ) , and have been imaged many times .",
    "in addition , dozens of galaxies have had total exposure times in the range of 12 days , with some sources ( e.g. , in m31 ) having had more coverage .",
    "it therefore seems well within the realm of possibility to detect planetary transits .",
    "already - discovered eclipsing xrbs can be used to guide searches through archival data for planetary transits for a number of reasons .",
    "first , these systems provide specific examples of a compact source being obscured , in that each exhibits a measured eclipse depth and duration . by studying the signal - to - noise and other characteristics of the eclipse",
    ", we can determine how small and how fast - moving a planet orbiting the x - ray source could be and still be detected .",
    "such feasibility studies will also inform analyses of other xrbs which do not exhibit stellar eclipses .",
    "second , because stellar and planetary orbits may be coplanar , an xrb in which there is a stellar eclipse may be more likely to also exhibit planetary eclipses , should that system host planets .",
    "thus , xrbs with stellar eclipses may be the most promising systems in which to search for planetary transits",
    ". the period of planetary transits would be different from the binary period ; the stability issues we discuss here would provide useful guides .",
    "finally , a stellar eclipse establishes that the x - ray source is compact .",
    "for example , the long - lasting x - ray eclipse in the black - hole / wolf - rayet binary x1 in the dwarf galaxy ic  10 , illustrates that some black hole binaries do have compact regions emitting distinctive x - rays .",
    "similarly , several eclipsing white dwarfs are known , where x - rays emanate from near the surface of the white dwarf ( e.g. , nucita et al .",
    "these indicate that it could be productive to search for planets orbiting white dwarfs that have recently experienced novae .",
    "post - nova , many systems pass through a _ supersoft _ phase in which x - rays with energies @xmath107  kev are emitted from near the white dwarf s surface",
    ". such searches may find planets in p - type orbits around close - binary novae and in s - type orbits in symbiotic novae , which generally have wide - orbit giant donors .",
    "equation ( [ eq : counts ] ) allows an estimate of the count rate necessary to allow transits to be identified .",
    "count rates that are large enough for this purpose can be provided by nearby xrbs or by distant yet bright xrbs .",
    "consider a source with x - ray luminosity equal to @xmath108  erg  s@xmath105 at @xmath109  mpc ; this corresponds to an ultraluminous xrb in an external galaxy .",
    "if the x - ray spectrum is a power law of index @xmath110 , _ xmm - newton _ would collect @xmath111 counts per second ( cps ) .",

    ") this can be sufficient for the discovery of transiting planets . ] the same flux would be obtained from a source of @xmath114  erg  s@xmath105 at @xmath109  kpc ; this could correspond to a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) in a galactic globular cluster , while the flux from a bright globular cluster lmxb would be @xmath115 times larger .",
    "alternatively , a very dim source with x - ray luminosity of @xmath116  erg  s@xmath105 at @xmath117  pc , would provide the same flux .",
    "an interesting application of our proposal to search for planets around xrbs is that the same technique could be used in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) , since if advanced civilizations exist , they may produce anomalies in astronomical systems .",
    "one possible anomaly could be caused by placing around a star a dyson sphere , a surface designed to capture a star s energy and convert the starlight into far - infrared emission ( dyson 1960 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that smaller , multiple structures could be placed in orbit around a star ( see , e.g. , harrop & schulze - makuch 2010 ) .",
    "should they exist , some such artificial structures might caused detectable transits .",
    "such artificial structures are often discussed in conjunction with the possible energy needs of an advanced civilization , and because any convincing discovery of them would provide evidence of exocivilizations .",
    "here we make a possible connection to xrbs , which are ( 1 ) highly luminous and therefore potentially desirable as sources of energy , and also ( 2 ) distinctive and rare enough to be targeted for x - ray observations by emerging technological civilizations .",
    "we therefore suggest that searching for transits around xrbs could in addition to or instead of leading to evidence of natural planets lead to evidence of artificial structures . while it is not clear that we could distinguish between natural and artificial structures , one could attempt to answer such questions as : are the planetary orbits stable ? does the light curve , especially during ingress and egress , suggest an unusual shape ?",
    "we also make a particular connection to globular clusters , which have been suggested as environments within which advanced civilizations may be able to thrive because of ( 1 ) the absence of young stars and the attendant risks , such as supernovae ; ( 2 ) the stability of orbits in the habitable zones of the low - mass stars comprising the primary cluster populations ; and ( 3 ) the relatively high stellar density , which could facilitate interstellar travel , should technologically advanced civilizations inhabit globular clusters ( distefano & ray 2016 ) .",
    "xrbs are rare , but are more common in globular clusters than in the rest of the galaxy ( clark 1975 ; distefano & rappaport 1994 )",
    ". furthermore , they could be significant sources of energy in an environment dominated by m dwarfs , while at the same time lying within a relatively small distance of any point in the cluster , due to the limited ( generally @xmath118 pc ) size of globular clusters .",
    "we have presented a novel idea for searching for exoplanets around mass transfer x - ray binaries . for demonstration of concept ,",
    "we have focused on cvs , in which the typical mass of the white dwarf is @xmath119 @xmath47  and the donor is a main - sequence star or a brown dwarf .",
    "if a planet is associated with such a binary , it is most likely to have a circumbinary ( p - type ) orbit . while , for a mass ratio of @xmath120 , the closest possible orbit would exhibit transits of just under a minute for an earth - size planet and about @xmath121 times longer for a jupiter - size planet , the transit durations would be larger in wider orbits .",
    "we have shown how these quantities scale for accretors of higher mass ( neutron stars and black holes ) and for a range of mass ratios .",
    "if the binary has a wider orbit , then either the compact object or the donor star , may support a planet in an s - type orbit .",
    "we have demonstrated that transits of planets orbiting xrbs , including symbiotic binaries , are detectable with present - day technology .",
    "future observations with missions such as the proposed _",
    "lynx _ x - ray mission , which may have @xmath117 times the sensitivity of _ chandra _ , will dramatically extend the opportunities for transit detection . if and when the first planet is detected around a mass transfer binary , follow - up observations could be conducted with other telescopes to constrain its atmospheric properties and to search for biosignatures ."
