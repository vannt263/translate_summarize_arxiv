    "<S> sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photons collected with the large area telescope on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope_. we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them . </S>",
    "<S> , with period @xmath0ms , was detected in archival parkes telescope data and subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope ( gbt ) . </S>",
    "<S> its received flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has a very small dispersion measure of @xmath1 , implying a distance of @xmath2kpc and possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar . at this distance , for isotropic emission , </S>",
    "<S> its gamma - ray luminosity above 0.1gev corresponds to 25% of the spin - down luminosity of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the gamma - ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely - spaced peaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also identified a soft source that is the likely x - ray counterpart . in many respects </S>",
    "<S> resembles the geminga pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> the second source , , was detected at the gbt . </S>",
    "<S> it has @xmath5ms , and its @xmath6  suggests a distance of @xmath7kpc , but we consider it likely that it is located within the  stellar association at half that distance . </S>",
    "<S> the radio emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized , and the main radio peak precedes by @xmath8 the first of two narrow gamma - ray peaks that are separated by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the second peak has a harder spectrum than the first one , following a trend observed in young gamma - ray pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> faint , diffuse x - ray emission in a  image is possibly its pulsar wind nebula .  </S>",
    "<S> likely accounts for the egret source , while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentified hegra source .  </S>",
    "<S> is coincident in projection with , a be star in , although apparently not a binary companion of it . </S>"
