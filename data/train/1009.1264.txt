    "prediction of the failure point is a major challenge in various scenarios of fracture and breakdown @xcite ranging from fracturing in nano - materials to onset of earthquakes .",
    "a material body can tolerate certain level of load or force on it and beyond that level it collapses . if the load is increased continuously - when does the collapse point come ?",
    "is there any precursor which signals that the complete failure is imminent ?    fiber bundle model ( fbm ) has been proved @xcite to capture the essentials of failures in composite materials .",
    "fbm contains a large number of fibers with statistically distributed strength thresholds .",
    "it has simple geometry and clear - cut rules for how stress caused by a failed fibers is redistributed on intact fibers .",
    "most importantly , this model can be solved analytically to an extent ( for reviews , see @xcite ) that is not possible for any other model of material - failure .",
    "the statistical properties of fbm is well studied @xcite , and the failure dynamics at a constant load has been formulated @xcite through recursion relations which in turn explore the phase transition and associated critical behavior in this model .        in this article",
    "we discuss how we can predict the failure point of a loaded fbm from the available precursors .",
    "the term _ precursor _ usually means @xcite some prior indications of an upcoming incident and in current context such incident is the complete failure ( collapse ) of a fiber bundle under external load .",
    "we consider equal - load - sharing model , in which the load previously carried by a failed fiber is shared equally by all the remaining intact fibers @xcite .",
    "the bundle consisting of @xmath0 elastic fibers , clamped at both ends ( fig .",
    "[ fbm - model ] ) .",
    "all the fibers obey hooke s law with force constant set to unity for simplicity .",
    "each fiber @xmath1 is associated with a breakdown threshold @xmath2 for its elongation .",
    "when the length exceeds @xmath2 the fiber breaks immediately , and does not contribute to the strength of the bundle thereafter .",
    "the individual thresholds @xmath2 are assumed to be independent random variables with the same cumulative distribution function @xmath3 and a corresponding density function @xmath4 : @xmath5    we analyse three different loading cases : quasi - static loading , load increment by equal steps and overloaded situation . for prediction purpose",
    "it is important that precursors can be seen in a single system .",
    "therefore , throughout this article we will present and discuss results that can be seen in a single bundle containing large number of fibers . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the uniform distribution of fiber thresholds : @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the _ quasi - static _ loading is a strain controlled method , where at each step the whole bundle is stretched till the weakest fiber ( among the intact ones ) fails . at an elongation @xmath8 per surviving fiber the total force on the bundle",
    "is @xmath8 times the number of _ intact _ fibers .",
    "the expected or average force at this stage is therefore @xmath9 the maximum @xmath10 of @xmath11 corresponds to the value @xmath12 for which @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath14 where @xmath12 is the critical elongation value above which the bundle collapses .",
    "when a fiber fails , the stress on the intact fibers increases .",
    "this may in turn trigger further fiber failures , which can produce bursts ( avalanches ) that either lead to a stable situation or to breakdown of the whole bundle .",
    "a burst is usually defined as the amount or number ( @xmath15 ) of simultaneous fiber failure during loading .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the average number of burst events of size @xmath15 follows a power law of the form @xmath16 in the limit @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the _ universal _ burst exponent and @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is , under mild assumptions , independent of the threshold distribution @xmath3 : the probability density needs to have a quadratic maximum somewhere within the range of threshold values .",
    "when all the bursts are recorded for the entire failure process , the burst distribution follows the asymptotic power law @xmath21 .",
    "if we just sample bursts that occur near the breakdown point , a different power law is seen which can be explained analytically @xcite .",
    "[ single - dist ] compares the complete burst distribution with what we get when we sample merely bursts in the threshold interval @xmath22 .     and",
    "@xmath23 ( circles ) .",
    "the figure is based on a single bundle containing @xmath24 fibers with uniformly distributed fiber thresholds within @xmath25 and @xmath26.,width=207,height=170 ]    this observation may be of practical importance , as it gives a criterion for the imminence of complete failure @xcite .",
    "the bursts or avalanches can be recorded from outside -without disturbing the ongoing failure process .",
    "therefore , any signature in burst statistics that can warn of imminent system failure would be very useful in the sense of wide scope of applicability .",
    "it is enticing to note the recent observation @xcite of a crossover behavior in the magnitude distribution of earthquakes before the largest earthquake appears . a similar crossover behavior is also seen @xcite in the burst distribution and energy distribution of the fuse model which is a standard model for studying fracture and breakdown phenomena in disordered systems .",
    "most important is that this crossover signal does not hinge on observing rare events and is seen in a single system ( see fig .",
    "[ single - dist ] ) . therefore , such crossover signature has a strong potential to be used as a detection tool .",
    "we have seen that if external load is increased quasi - statically on a bundle of large number of fibers , bursts of different sizes occur during the whole breaking process till complete failure .",
    "one can ask - what is the average burst size at a particular elongation ( @xmath8 ) value ?",
    "the average burst size is indeed a very relevant quantity that can be measured easily during the failure process .",
    "it seems ( fig .",
    "[ avdel2 ] ) that average burst size ( @xmath27 ) around some elongation value @xmath8 goes as @xmath28 this means if we plot @xmath29 vs. @xmath8 , we should get a straight line which touches the @xmath30 axis at @xmath31 . even in a single system",
    "we can see this signature ( fig .",
    "[ avdel1 ] ) .     vs. elongation @xmath8 for the same fiber bundle as in fig .",
    "[ single - dist].,width=207,height=170 ]     for the same data set as in fig .",
    "[ avdel2 ] .",
    "a straight line can be fitted near @xmath12 from which one can predict the failure point.,width=207,height=170 ]",
    "in the force - controlled case , load can be increased on a bundle by equal amount at each loading step . here",
    ", the failure dynamics of the bundle can be represented by a recursion relation : let @xmath32 be the number of fibers that survive after step @xmath33 , where @xmath33 indicates the number of stress redistribution steps .",
    "we call @xmath34 , the applied stress and @xmath35 , the surviving fraction of total fibers .",
    "then the effective stress after @xmath33 step becomes @xmath36 and after @xmath37 steps the surviving fraction of total fibers will be @xmath38 . therefore we can construct the following recursion relation @xcite @xmath39 at equilibrium @xmath40 . for uniform fiber strength distribution , the cumulative distribution becomes @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the recursion relation becomes @xmath42 at the fixed point the above relation takes a quadratic form @xmath43 with the solutions @xmath44 one can define the breakdown susceptibility @xmath45 , as the change of @xmath46 due to an infinitesimal increment of the applied stress @xmath47 : @xmath48 to study the failure dynamics around the critical point ( @xmath49 ) , the recursion relation ( eq .",
    "[ rec - u - uniform ] ) can be replaced by a differential equation @xmath50 close to the fixed point one gets @xcite @xmath51 where the relaxation time @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "therefore , near the critical point @xmath53 diverges : @xmath54     and @xmath55 with applied stress for the same bundle as in fig.[single - dist ] .",
    "the dotted straight lines are the best linear fits near the critical point.,title=\"fig:\",width=207,height=170 ]   and @xmath55 with applied stress for the same bundle as in fig.[single - dist ] .",
    "the dotted straight lines are the best linear fits near the critical point.,title=\"fig:\",width=207,height=170 ]    since the susceptibility ( @xmath45 ) and the relaxation time ( @xmath53 ) follow power laws ( exponent @xmath56 ) with external stress and both diverge at the critical stress , therefore , if we plot @xmath57 and @xmath55 with external stress , we expect a linear fit near critical point and the straight lines should touch @xmath30 axis at the critical stress .",
    "we indeed found similar behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xi - tau ] ) in simulation experiments for a single sample .",
    "what happens if the initial applied load @xmath58 is larger than the critical load of the bundle ? the stepwise failure process continues and the bundle collapses at some step @xmath59 . if we consider the uniform distribution of fiber thresholds , and assume that the load is slightly above the critical value : @xmath60 with @xmath61 , we can rewrite the recursion relation ( eq . [ rec - basic ] ) as @xmath62 the solution @xcite of the above recursion shows that there is a relation between the minimum of the breaking rate @xmath63 ( treating @xmath33 as continuous variable ) and the final step @xmath59 : @xmath64 at the minimum of the breaking rate , the bundle is just halfway to its complete collapse .",
    "simulations on a single sample show that the breaking rate has a minimum at some value @xmath65 , and that for varying @xmath66 the minima all occur at a value close to @xmath67 when plotted as function of the scaled variable @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ breaking - rate - fig ] ) .     vs. step @xmath33 ( upper plot ) and vs.  the rescaled step variable @xmath68 ( lower plot ) for the same fiber bundle as in fig.[single - dist ] .",
    "different symbols are used for different excess stress levels @xmath69 : 0.001 ( circles ) , 0.003 ( triangles ) and 0.005 ( squares ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=207,height=170 ]",
    "it is well known that during fracturing process in composite materials , energy releases in the form of acoustic emissions @xcite and most of the cases these acoustic bursts follow power laws .",
    "very recently the statistics of energy emission bursts has been studied @xcite in fbm -both analytically and through numerical simulations .",
    "as the fibers obey hooks law up to the failure , when a fiber fails at an elongation @xmath8 , elastic energy of amount @xmath70 will be released , where @xmath71 is the force constant .",
    "therefore for a burst of size @xmath15 the corresponding energy release @xmath72 can be calculated as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the strength of failing fiber .",
    "now at a constant applied load , if we record @xmath72 at each step of load redistribution , it shows different pattern ( fig .",
    "[ en - pattern ] ) depending on the stress level at critical , over - critical or below - critical .",
    "if we record such energy emission bursts separately for below - critical and over - critical levels , the corresponding distributions exhibit convincing difference ( figs .",
    "[ en - below],[en - over ] ) . for stresses below - critical level , there are many many small energy bursts which are absent in the later case .",
    "the exponent of the energy burst distributions are different for these two situations : @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .     vs. step number in the same bundle as in fig.[single - dist ] .",
    "different symbols indicate different stress levels : at critical stress @xmath77 ( circles ) ; stress @xmath78 ( triangles ) and stress @xmath79 ( squares).,width=188,height=143 ]     in the same fiber bundle as in fig [ single - dist ] for stresses below critical value : @xmath79 ( circles ) , @xmath80 ( triangles ) .",

    ". the straight line has a slope @xmath76.,width=188,height=132 ]",
    "in summary , the fiber bundle model of composite material shows some precursors which can help to predict the failure point of the system under different loading situations .",
    "when external load is increased quasi - statically , near the failure point the exponent of burst distribution shows a crossover from @xmath83 to @xmath84 and the average burst size diverges . while the crossover signature can only warn of an imminent failure , it is possible to predict critical elongation value ( @xmath23 ) in advance by measuring the average burst size .",
    "if the load is increased by equal steps , susceptibility and relaxation time seem to diverge at failure stress ( @xmath77 ) following robust power laws - from which one can predict the failure stress value without approaching too close to the failure point . when the bundle is overloaded",
    "the rate of breaking has a minimum at half way to the collapse point and the distributions of energy emission bursts follow different power laws for below - critical and over - critical load levels .",
    "a very recent study @xcite shows that for overloaded case , the energy bursts also attain a minimum value around half way to complete collapse .",
