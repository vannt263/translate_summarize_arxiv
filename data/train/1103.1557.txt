    "in the course of the last decade , a great deal of interest has been drawn to theoretical and experimental studies of the nonlinear dynamics in systems with periodic potentials .",
    "physical realizations of this topic are well known in nonlinear optics @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in optical media , the periodic ( lattice )",
    "potentials may be created as permanent or virtual ones ( in the latter case , these are photonic lattices induced in photorefractive crystals @xcite ) . in becs",
    ", similar potentials can be induced in the form of optical lattices ( ols ) , i.e. , interference patterns formed by laser beams shone through the condensate .",
    "the ols make it possible to study a great variety of dynamical effects in becs @xcite .",
    "similar periodic potentials may also be imposed by magnetic lattices @xcite .",
    "it is commonly known that , in the free space , stable one - dimensional ( 1d ) solitons exist in optical waveguides and becs with the attractive cubic nonlinearity , while in the 2d and 3d geometry the solitons are unstable to the collapse @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been predicted that 2d @xcite and 3d baizakov1,baizakov3 solitons can be stabilized by dint of the corresponding ols .",
    "moreover , low - dimensional ols , i.e. , quasi-1d and quasi-2d lattices in the 2d @xcite and 3d baizakov3,mihalache1 space , respectively , also provide for the stabilization of fully localized multidimensional solitons .",
    "a related prediction is the existence of stable 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite solitons in models with radial ols .    in becs with repulsive interactions between atoms ,",
    "i.e. , the repulsive intrinsic nonlinearity , solitons can not exist in free space , but gap solitons ( gss ) may be supported by the ol .",
    "the principle behind the formation of the gs is that the periodic potential can invert the sign of the effective mass of collective excitations , which may then balance the repulsive nonlinearity . in the 1d case ,",
    "several species of gss are known , which include fundamental solitons and their two- and three - peak bound complexes , in the first and second bandgaps @xcite , and _",
    "subfundamental _ solitons in the second gap ( the latter means a twisted soliton squeezed into a single cell of the potential lattice , whose norm is smaller than the norm of the fundamental soliton existing at the same value of the chemical potential ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of the gs families may be traced back to bifurcations generating them from bloch waves at edges of the bandgaps @xcite .",
    "multidimensional gss are represented by fundamental solitons multidimensionalgs1,multidimensionalgs2,sakaguchi , gubeskys2 and gap - type vortices gubeskys1,multidimensionalgs2,ostrovskaya , sakaguchi , mayteevarunyoo2 . in particular , the simplest gap vortices",
    "are composed of four density peaks , and fall into two different categories : densely packed squares ( alias off - site - centered vortices ) , in which the center is positioned around a local maximum of the ol potential multidimensionalgs2,ostrovskaya , mayteevarunyoo2 , and rhombic ( on - site - centered ) configurations , featuring a nearly empty lattice cell in the middle @xcite . while gs families in 2d are also generated by bifurcations from the respective bloch waves @xcite , there are gap - vortex families which do not originate from such bifurcations @xcite .    in the experiment , an effectively one - dimensional gs , composed of few hundred atoms , was created in the condensate of @xmath3rb @xcite . in another experiment , which involved a stronger ol ,",
    "broad confined states were created @xcite .",
    "they were interpreted as modes intermediate between the gss and extended nonlinear bloch waves @xcite .    in a different framework , solitons can be supported by a spatial modulation of the local nonlinearity ( a particular case of the  nonlinearity management \" @xcite ) . in terms of solid - state physics , an effective potential structure induced by means of this method",
    "is called a _ pseudopotential _",
    "realizations of such structures are possible in optics and becs , where they are expected to give rise to many new effects , see recent review @xcite . in optical media ,",
    "nonlinearity - modulation profiles can be induced by means of nonuniform distributions of resonant dopants , similar to those in resonantly - absorbing bragg reflectors , see original works @xcite and review rabr - review .",
    "such dopant - density patterns can be created by means of available technology @xcite . for matter waves in becs",
    ", similar nonlinear profiles can be created via the spatial modulation of @xmath4 , the local value of the _ s_-wave scattering length .",
    "such modulations can be induced by means of the feshbach resonance , controlled by a nonuniform dc magnetic field @xcite or resonant optical field fedichev , theis .",
    "it was also predicted that the feshbach resonance may be controlled by dc electric fields @xcite .",
    "note that the feshbach resonance allows one to create a pseudopotential corresponding to a _ sign - changing _",
    "function @xmath4 ( actually , this is possible in the condensate of @xmath5li @xcite ) , which implies the spatial alternation between the attractive and repulsive signs of the nonlinearity .    in the context of the becs , many works dealt with solitons and related dynamical states in the framework of 1d pseudopotential structures becpseudopotential .",
    "nonlinear structures based on the spatial modulation of the kerr coefficient were also considered in optics , giving rise to similar states @xcite .",
    "solitons supported by 2d pseudopotentials were theoretically studied too , with a conclusion that it is much more difficult to stabilize them than using linear ol potentials @xcite .",
    "the results accumulated in the studies of solitons in nonlinear lattices are summarized in a recent review @xcite .",
    "a specific example of such nonlinear pseudopotential settings is a model where the nonlinearity is concentrated at a single point , which is represented by a @xmath0-function . a prototypical model of this type",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "it may represent a planar linear waveguide with a narrow nonlinear stripe embedded into it ( for the case of the second - harmonic - generating quadratic nonlinearity , spatial solitons in a similar setting were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in terms of the becs",
    ", localized nonlinearity may be induced through the feshbach resonance imposed by a focused laser beam .",
    "it should be said that a more realistic model would also include a uniform background nonlinearity , as it is difficult to create a setting where it might be completely eliminated .",
    "nevertheless , it makes sense to consider , as the basic one , the model in which the nonlinearity is represented solely by the localized terms , as it is reasonable to assume that the weakly nonlinear background will not lead to a drastic change of the results . extending the studies in this direction , a model of a double - well pseudopotential , based on a symmetric set of two @xmath2-functions , or their regularized counterparts ,",
    "was introduced , with the purpose of studying the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of localized modes @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is possible to find full analytical solutions for symmetric , asymmetric and antisymmetric states in the model with two ideal @xmath0-functions . in this model , where the ssb bifurcation is of the subcritical type , the symmetric solutions are stable up to the bifurcation point . beyond this point ,",
    "the symmetric states and the emerging asymmetric states are unstable , as well as all the antisymmetric ones .",
    "symmetry breaking in a circular nonlinear lattice , with a smooth spatial modulation of @xmath6 , was studied , in the framework of both the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) and many - body quantum system , in ref .",
    "a natural extension of the settings outlined above is a model integrating the linear ol potential and the nonlinearity concentrated at one or two points , represented by the respective @xmath0-functions or their regularized versions .",
    "these systems are the subject of the present work .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that , while cusp - shaped solitons pinned to the @xmath2-function multiplying the attractive cubic nonlinearity turn out to be unstable , the linear periodic potential readily stabilizes them .",
    "another issue of obvious interest is whether the strongly localized repulsive nonlinearity may support gss in finite bandgaps of the ol - induced spectrum ( we demonstrate that this is possible indeed ) .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is formulated in section  [ sec : model ] . for the system including the single @xmath0-function and ol potential , analytical approximations , based on the perturbation theory ,",
    "are developed for the pinned modes in the first and second finite bandgaps , as well as in the semi - infinite gap , in section sec : approximation .",
    "a comparison with numerical findings is performed too .",
    "detailed results of the numerical analysis for the existence and , most important , stability of the pinned modes in the semi - infinite , first and second gaps are reported in section [ sec : singledelta ] .",
    "both the attractive and repulsive signs of the @xmath0-functional nonlinearity are considered , for different positions of the @xmath0-function with respect to the underlying lattice . in section  [ sec : twodeltas ] , the analysis is reported for symmetric , antisymmetric and asymmetric modes supported by a pair of the @xmath0-functions , positioned symmetrically with respect to a maximum or minimum of the ol potential .",
    "the paper is concluded by section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the model featuring the cubic nonlinearity represented by the @xmath0-function was introduced in ref .",

    "<S> nonlinear periodic systems , such as photonic crystals and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) loaded into optical lattices , are often described by the nonlinear schrdinger / gross - pitaevskii equation with a sinusoidal potential . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a model based on such a periodic potential , with the nonlinearity ( attractive or repulsive ) concentrated either at a single point or at a symmetric set of two points , which are represented , respectively , by a single @xmath0-function or a combination of two @xmath1-functions . with the attractive or repulsive sign of the nonlinearity </S>",
    "<S> , this model gives rise to ordinary solitons or gap solitons ( gss ) , which reside , respectively , in the semi - infinite or finite gaps of the system s linear spectrum , being pinned to the @xmath0-functions . </S>",
    "<S> physical realizations of these systems are possible in optics and bec , using diverse variants of the nonlinearity management . </S>",
    "<S> first , we demonstrate that the single @xmath0-function multiplying the nonlinear term supports families of _ stable _ regular solitons in the self - attractive case , while a family of solitons supported by the attractive @xmath0-function in the absence of the periodic potential is completely unstable . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the @xmath2-function can support _ </S>",
    "<S> stable _ gss in the first finite bandgap in both the self - attractive and repulsive models . </S>",
    "<S> the stability analysis for the gss in the second finite bandgap is reported too , for both signs of the nonlinearity . alongside the numerical analysis , </S>",
    "<S> analytical approximations are developed for the solitons in the semi - infinite and first two finite gaps , with the single @xmath0-function positioned at a minimum or maximum of the periodic potential . in the model with the symmetric set of two @xmath2-functions , we study the effect of the _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ of the pinned solitons . </S>",
    "<S> two configurations are considered , with the @xmath0-functions set symmetrically with respect to the minimum or maximum of the underlying potential . </S>"
