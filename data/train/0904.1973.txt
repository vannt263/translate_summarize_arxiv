    "<S> as the @xmath3-wave collective mode contribution arises only from multiple scattering among the @xmath17 bands , the contribution from the @xmath9 bands will be determined from simple non - interacting considerations given in ref . . </S>",

    "<S> this may allow for this mode contribution to appear at low energies distinctly separate from the continuum in raman experiments on the pnictides , unlike the situation in conventional superconductors.@xcite    therefore the detailed lineshape of the electronic raman continuum may be determined from the interplay of anisotropies of the raman vertices and the structure of the pairing interaction using symmetry arguments , as applied successfully in the cuprates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what may distinguish the fe pnictides from the cuprates may be the presence of pairing channels having almost equal strength , as indicated in recent spin - fluctuation and rg considerations . </S>",
    "<S> this paper has shown that such a circumstance will result in collective mode contribution which will have an unique polarization signature in the raman spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this could open a window into the determination of the pairing structure of the pnictides and provide important clues to the pairing mechanism . </S>"
