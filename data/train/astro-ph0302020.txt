    "during the thermally - pulsing ( tp- ) agb phase of low- and intermediate - mass stars , several `` third dredge - up '' episodes  followed by hot - bottom burning in the most massive stars  cause the surface pollution with he and cno elements of primary origin , which are eventually ejected into the interstellar medium .",
    "although the occurrence of the third dredge - up is well established from theory , its efficiency is still uncertain .",
    "also uncertain is the total duration of the tp - agb phase , determined by both the dredge - up efficiency in reducing the core mass , and the mass - loss efficiency in peeling the star of its envelope .",
    "these uncertainties directly affect the estimates of the he and cno chemical yields , as well as the predicted abundances of planetary nebulae .",
    "the most evident effect of the third dredge - up is the formation of carbon ( c ) stars when the surface c / o ratio increases above 1 . therefore , c stars in resolved stellar populations constitute the best tool for calibrating the third dredge - up efficiency and hence constraining tp - agb models and their chemical yields ( see e.g. marigo et al . 1999 , and marigo 2001 ) .",
    "recently , marigo ( 2002 , and talk in this meeting ) showed that the adoption of variable molecular opacities  suitably coupled to the varying envelope composition along the tp - agb  dramatically changes the evolutionary properties of tp - agb models , allowing a much better agreement with observed @xmath6 and c / o values for c stars .",
    "the improved models make it necessary a re - calibration of the third dredge - up efficiency . with this aim",
    ", we are currently analysing the c star data for the magellanic clouds .",
    "one main evolutionary effect of variable molecular opacities is a reduction of @xmath6 values for c stars , which then causes an earlier onset of the superwind regime and reduces their lifetimes .    to check the lifetimes of the new tp - agb models , we have used the number of c stars in lmc star clusters normalised to their integrated @xmath7-band luminosity , @xmath8 ( fig.1a ) .",
    "this plot gives an almost direct and model - independent measure of the typical c - star lifetimes .",
    "the data ( dots with error bars ) put clear constraints for masses between 1.5 and 2.8 @xmath9 , whereas at higher / lower masses just upper limits ( arrows ) can be defined .",
    "models with more efficient dredge - up ( lower @xmath4 and/or higher @xmath5 ) are clearly favoured by the comparison with these data .",
    "the same data indicate that c - star lifetimes vary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 myr , for stars in the mass interval from @xmath2 to @xmath10 ( fig.1b ) . it should be noticed that several models in the literature present lifetimes significantly shorter than these values . in models with variable molecular opacities ,",
    "the observed lifetimes are attained provided that efficient dredge - up is favoured at low - masses  for instance with the dredge - up parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these are the same values calibrated by marigo et al .",
    ".    models with these parameters tend to reproduce reasonably well the luminosities of individual c stars observed in lmc clusters , although such data is scarse and do not cover the complete age interval of interest . instead ,",
    "the lmc c - star luminosity function is slightly better reproduced by models with a later onset of the dredge - up , i.e.  @xmath13 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for the smc , the mean peak luminosity is well reproduced with @xmath11 .",
    "we are presently testing different combinations for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in order to find dredge - up parameters that best fit all the available data .",
    "our preliminar calibrations are being checked in comparison with additional data for agb stars in local group galaxies . once the calibration is carried out , improved sets of chemical yields for tp - agb models",
    "will be derived , as well as the related theoretical isochrones and synthetic cmds ( marigo et al .",
