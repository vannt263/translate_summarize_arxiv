    "in contrast to our discussion on graphs and their domination reliability , the vertices of the hypergraph are assumed to be perfectly reliable , whereas the edges fail randomly and independently with known probabilities , given by a vector @xmath190^{\\mathscr{e}}$ ] .",
    "the _ coverage probability _ of @xmath22 , which is abbreviated to @xmath191 , is the probability that the operating edges of @xmath22 constitute a covering of the vertex - set of @xmath22 .",
    "given a hypergraph @xmath187 and a probability vector @xmath192^{\\mathscr{e}}$ ] , construct a graph @xmath1 on @xmath193 with edge set @xmath194 by defining @xmath195 for any @xmath10 ( in addition to the given probabilities @xmath196 where @xmath197 ) , a probability of operation is associated with any vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "evidently , by this construction , the coverage probability of @xmath22 equals the domination reliability of @xmath1 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the domination reliability of any graph can be expressed in terms of the coverage probability of an associated hypergraph : given a graph @xmath0 and @xmath198^{v}$ ] , construct @xmath187 where @xmath199\\mathrel|v\\in v\\}$ ] and where for any @xmath200 , @xmath201 is the probability that some vertex in @xmath202=e\\}$ ] is operating in @xmath1 . by the principle of inclusion - exclusion",
    "this probability can be computed as @xmath203=e \\,\\forall i\\in i}}(-1)^{|i|-1}\\prod_{i\\in i}p_{i}\\quad(e\\in\\mathscr{e}).\\ ] ] by this construction , the domination reliability of @xmath1 equals the coverage probability of  @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the equivalence of the two concepts is shown .",
    "the concept of coverage probability of hypergraphs goes back to ball , provan , and shier @xcite .",
    "the significance of this concept is due to the fact that the reliability of any coherent binary system can be expressed in terms of the coverage probability of an associated hypergraph , and vice versa ( see @xcite for definition and details ) .",
    "in this paper , we introduced a new network reliability measure called _ domination reliability _ and proved that its computation is np - hard .",
    "efficient solutions are only known for cographs . for complete graphs , complete bipartite graphs , paths , and cycles explicit and recursive",
    "formul can be given in the case where all vertex reliabilities are equal .",
    "this case is of particular interest as it leads to a new graph polynomial , which is called _ domination reliability polynomial _ , and which is closely related to the domination polynomial  a graph polynomial which recently received considerable attention .",
    "the authors propose to investigate the domination reliability polynomial in context with the domination polynomial , and to work out relationships with other graph polynomials .    from a practical point of view",
    ", the connection with the coverage probability of a hypergraph is significant : any coherent binary system can be transformed into a graph whose domination reliability equals the reliability of that system , and vice versa .",
    "thus , the study of domination reliability may reveal some new insights into system reliability ."
