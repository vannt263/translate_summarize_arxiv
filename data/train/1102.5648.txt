    "it is well known that @xmath0 decays overwhelmingly via strong and electromagnetic interactions , which are the ozi @xcite suppressed processes .",
    "the goal of the research on @xmath0 is not only to study the low energy qcd effects which determine the hadronic transition matrix elements , but also to find evidence of new physics in the concerned processes .",
    "since the strong interaction qcd dominates , the contributions of new physics whose effects are in general much smaller , would be drowned by the qcd background and unobservable . to observe the processes where new physics may play more important role",
    ", we need to turn to the rare decays of @xmath0 .",
    "one obvious field is the weak decays of @xmath0 . of course ,",
    "due to the dominance of the strong interaction at @xmath0 decays , the branching ratios of such weak decays are very small , so that measurements on them are extremely difficult .    in our earlier papers @xcite the branching ratios of semi - leptonic and hadronic weak decays of @xmath0 into two mesons ( vector or pseudoscalar ) are evaluated in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) and we found that they are of order of @xmath6 to @xmath7 which is much beyond the range of detection for any present machines .",
    "however , the situation is not so pessimistic , as the database accumulated at the bes iii is becoming large and the proposed super - flavor factory will be running in the future , measurements on the weak decays may be possible .",
    "it is expected that if some sizable signals for the weak decays are observed ( even still very small ) , one would conclude that there is new physics or new mechanism beyond our present knowledge",
    ". moreover , as stated above , the main goal is to see if for some modes the ratios obviously exceed the values theoretically calculated in terms of sm , if yes , it would be clear signals for new physics beyond sm .",
    "that is what we expect .    for a long time",
    "more researches focus on mesons than baryons .",
    "the reason is that there are three constituents in baryon and there are only two in mesons in comparison .",
    "the three - body system indeed is much more complicated than the two - body one , even in the classical physics .",
    "another reason is that the data concerning baryon final states are not as abundant as for mesons , so that it is harder to fix the model parameters .",
    "but now a larger database on baryon final states will be available at the lhcb and other experiments such as bes - iii , especially the proposed super - flavor factory .",
    "since baryons possess different characteristic from mesons a thorough study on the production and decay processes of baryon is becoming an important field which will provide a clearer insight into the structure of hadron , underlying physics , mechanics and the fundamental interactions , especially such processes may be more sensitive to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "on the other hand we will also have a chance to test some models and constrain their parameter space .",
    "moreover , the plan of studying baryon case at bes iii is substantialized , so that we would like to pay more attention to the weak decays of @xmath0 into baryon final state , even though corresponding processes are rare .",
    "in this paper we study the production of @xmath8 which occurs via weak interaction . concretely",
    ", we will calculate the rate in the frameworks of the sm and beyond . as an example for the model beyond the sm",
    ", we employ the unparticle scenario proposed by georgi @xcite .",
    "some phenomenology concerning the unparticle scenario has been explored @xcite and constraints on its parameter space were set by fitting observational data .",
    "therefore , the concerned model parameters have been determined and there is not much room for adjusting them . in this work",
    "we will estimate the contributions from both the sm particles and the unparticle as the intermediate agent to @xmath4 .",
    "a comparison between their contributions may shed some light on the role of the possible models beyond the sm .    since three pairs of quarks and antiquarks",
    "are produced from either the intermediate bosons or vacuum , the processes are more complex than the case for mesons .",
    "but it does not cause any principal difficulty . in this work",
    "we will employ the quark - pair - creation model(qpc model)@xcite to deal with the quark pair production and the harmonic oscillator wave function for the hadrons .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair is created from vacuum in this model and the essence of the picture is that the quark - pair is created from the soft gluons radiated from the quark - antiquark legs .",
    "the key point is to evaluate the transition matrix elements between hadrons which are governed by the non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the harmonic oscillator wave function is used to describe the bound states in this model and the corresponding non - perturbative effect is included in the model - parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after the introduction , in section ii and iii we formulate the transition amplitude of the process @xmath10 in sm and unparticle model respectively .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section we are going to calculate the decay widths of @xmath10 in sm .",
    "we show the feynman diagrams in fig.[fig : qpc ] and the left one is that in the sm .",
    "the c quark directly transits into the finial @xmath11 as a spectator and @xmath12 decays into @xmath13 and @xmath14 via a w - boson exchange .",
    "a pair of @xmath15 is created from the vacuum .",
    "then those quarks and anti - quarks eventually hadronize into @xmath11 and @xmath16 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      in the fig.[fig : qpc ] a pair of @xmath17 is created from vacuum .",
    "the qpc model is also named as 3p0 model since the quantum number of the vacuum is @xmath18 . in the qpc model",
    "the pair of quark - antiquark is created from the vacuum while other quarks are unaffected .",
    "the s - matrix element is @xmath19 and the hamiltonian @xmath20 which is responsible for the creation of quark - antiquark pair from the vacuum@xcite is @xmath21 b^{+}_{i}(\\mathbf{p}_{q},s)d^{+}_{j}(\\mathbf{p}_{\\bar q},s'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is an su(3 ) flavor - singlet , @xmath23 is a color - singlet , @xmath24 for a spin - triplet , @xmath25 is a solid harmonic polynomial for the @xmath26 orbital angular momentum and @xmath27 is a dimensionless constant representing the strength of the creation and generally it is a fully non - perturbative qcd factor and must be determined by fitting data .",
    "the s - matrix element can be expressed in terms of the amplitude @xmath28 @xmath29    for a two - body decay the width is @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands as the initial particle , b and c are the daughter hadrons .",
    "it is noted that the bjorken - drell convention is used .",
    "now we begin to evaluate the transition matrix element in the qpc model .",
    "first in terms of eq.([qpc1 ] ) we have @xmath32 where the hamiltonian @xmath33 is responsible for the weak transition .",
    "the expression becomes @xmath34 and @xmath35    in terms of the wave functions listed in the appendix we obtain @xmath36\\delta^3(p_j - p_{\\lambda_c}-p_{\\sigma } ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a color - related factor and @xmath38 is a flavor - spin factor .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we need to emphasize that the expansion of the field operator @xmath1 and @xmath40 and the anti - commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators need to follow the bjorken - drell convention .",
    "here we take the unparticle model as an examplefor the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that other new physics models beyond the sm may behave quite differently from the unparticle and their contributions to the mode may deviate by orders from that of unparticle .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are presented in fig.[fig : qpc](b ) where the intermediate agent is replaced by an unparticle . unlike the w - boson ,",
    "the unparticle is neutral and allows existence of a flavor - changing neutral curresnt , so @xmath41 decays into @xmath42 .",

    "since it is impossible to integrate out the variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath28 analytically we instead proceed the whole calculation in eq.([qpc4 ] ) numerically .",
    "the input parameters @xmath51gev , @xmath52gev , @xmath53gev and @xmath54 are set in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 in the wave function is corresponding to @xmath55 in @xcite which can be fixed by fitting its decay constant . instead , by means of the binding energy @xmath56 , we have @xmath57gev@xmath58 @xcite which is close to the number obtained by fitting the decay constant .",
    "@xmath59gev@xmath58@xcite was determined for light baryon , thus we set @xmath60gev@xmath58 in our numerical computations . for @xmath11",
    "if the @xmath61 quarks can be regarded as a diquark @xmath62 should be equal to @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , approximately , but sufficiently accurate , we set @xmath65 gev@xmath66 . in our calculation",
    "we suppose that the quarks which participate in the weak transition are approximately on shell .",
    "the parameters in the sm sector are @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69@xcite . with all the parameters we get @xmath70 .",
    "if we replace @xmath13 by @xmath42 in fig.[fig : qpc ] we obtain @xmath71 as @xmath72 .    for the unparticle scenario , according to the present literature , the relevant parameters are fixed as @xmath73tev , @xmath74 @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 according to ref.@xcite , and we also set @xmath78 and @xmath79 in our calculations .",
    "if only the contribution from unparticle is considered , one has @xmath80 to be @xmath81 for scalar unparticle and it is @xmath82 for vector unparticle .",
    "because they are many orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution of the sm , the interference between the sm and unparticle contributions are negligible .",
    "thus it is found that the branching ratio of baryonic decays @xmath83 has the same order of magnitude with that of @xmath0 decaying into a charmed meson plus something else@xcite .",
    "in this work we study the weak baryonic decay of @xmath0 : @xmath84 in the sm and beyond . in the calculation",
    "we employ a phenomenological model i.e. the qpc model to deal with the quark - antiquark pair creation and for calculating the hadronic transition matrix elements we use the harmonic oscillator wavefunction to describe both the baryonic and mesonic bound states . the model parameters are fixed by fitting the available experimental data .",
    "the advantage is that we can reduce the model - dependence , while the disadvantage is that the errors in the data will be unavoidably brought into the theoretical predictions .",
    "as one has a better knowledge on the error in the data , on the other side however , the uncertainties are well controlled within a reasonable range , so the numerical results are trustworthy , at least at the order of magnitude , even though not very accurate .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath83 in the sm would reach the order of magnitude as about @xmath5 , which is of the same order as that for mesonic decays of @xmath0 .",
    "such small branching fraction definitely can not be observed by the present experimental facilities .    at first",
    "look , the unparticle scenario might provide a larger contribution to the decay mode because there does not exist a heavy weak scale @xmath85 at its propagator .",
    "however , the the data of @xmath86 mixing@xcite , neutrino experiment@xcite and lepton flavor violation @xcite rigorously constrains the effective couplings of the unparticle and the sm particles , thus one can not freely adjust anything at all .",
    "the resultant contribution of the unparticle to the decay width is many order of magnitude smaller than that of the sm .",
    "therefore this decay mode can not be a probe for the unparticle scenario which has been explored by many authors .",
    "the large database of @xmath0 which will be collected at bes iii and the will - be super - flavor factory may reach the accuracy to realize the measurements on weak transitions . just because of its significance such experiment is required to be carried out .",
    "indeed , if such weak processes were observed to be larger by orders than that we estimated above , it signifies existence of new physics beyond the sm or new mechanisms or new hadronic structure , but by our calculation , definitely not from the unparticle contribution .",
