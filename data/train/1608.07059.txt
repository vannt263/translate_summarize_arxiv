    "<S> in the literature , there are numerous studies of one - dimensional discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqws ) using a moving shift operator . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no exact solution for the limiting probability distributions of dtqws on cycles using a general coin or swapping shift operator . in this paper , we derive exact solutions for the limiting probability distribution of quantum walks using a general coin and swapping shift operator on cycles for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> based on the exact solutions , we show how to generate symmetric quantum walks and determine the condition under which a symmetric quantum walks appears . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that choosing various coin and initial state parameters can achieve a symmetric quantum walk . by defining a quantity to measure the variation of symmetry , deviation and mixing time of symmetric </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks are also investigated . </S>"
