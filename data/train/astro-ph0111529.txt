    "shock acceleration has been studied carefully and a vast literature exists on the topic , including some recent excellent reviews @xcite .",
    "hence we do not try to provide here any extensive introduction to the problem , but we rather limit ourselves to summarize some of the open issues related to the backreaction of the accelerated particles onto the shocked fluid .",
    "the accelerated particles start to affect the fluid when their energy density becomes comparable to the kinetic energy density of the fluid . in this regime",
    "the test particle approximation breaks down , and the standard results of shock acceleration can not be recovered .",
    "the only way to have a complete quantitative picture of this problem is to use numerical simulations @xcite , but it is useful to have a practical analytical tool to understand the physics behind the simulations and also to take into account the non linear effects also when these simulations are not available , which is unfortunately the rule rather than the exception .",
    "numerical simulations show that even when the fraction of particles injected from the plasma is relatively small , the energy channelled into these few particles can be close to the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid , making the test particle approach unsuitable .",
    "the most visible effect is on the spectrum of the accelerated particles , which shows a peculiar hardening at the highest energies .",
    "the need to have a theoretical understanding of the non - linear effects in particle acceleration fueled many efforts in finding some _ effective _ though simplified picture of the problem ( see @xcite for a discussion of these alternative approaches ) .",
    "we will compare our findings with those of ref . @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we summarize the results widely discussed in @xcite , where an approach was proposed that provides a very nice fit to the results of simulations and is in agreement with previous analyical calculations .",
    "the distribution function of the particles accelerated at a planar infinite shock can be written in implicit form as @xcite : @xmath0 @xmath1\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : implicit}\\ ] ] where we put @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the compression factor at the shock surface [ @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the fluid velocity upstream ( downstream ) ] .",
    "@xmath7 is the number density of particles injected at the shock , parametrized here as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gas density at @xmath10 ( upstream ) .",
    "particles are assumed to be injected at the shock surface with momentum @xmath11 .",
    "( [ eq : implicit ] ) tells us that the spectrum of accelerated particles has a local slope given by @xmath12 .",
    "the problem of determining the spectrum of accelerated particles is then solved if the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is found .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the shocked fluid are embedded in the usual conservation equations , including now the contribution from accelerated particles .",
    "the mass and momentum conservation equations read : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gas pressures at the point @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , and @xmath21 is the pressure in accelerated particles at the point @xmath22 ( we used the symbol @xmath23 to mean _ cosmic rays _ , to be interpreted here in a very broad sense ) . in writing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) and ( [ eq : pressure ] ) we implicitly assumed that the average velocity @xmath13 coincides with the fluid velocity at the point where the particles with momentum @xmath14 turn around to recross the shock .",
    "our basic assumption is that the diffusion is @xmath14-dependent and that therefore particles with larger momenta move farther away from the shock than lower momentum particles . at each fixed @xmath22",
    "only particles with momentum larger than @xmath14 are able to affect the fluid .",
    "since only particles with momentum @xmath24 can reach the point @xmath20 , we can write @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the velocity of particles whose momentum is @xmath14 , and @xmath27 is the maximum momentum achievable in the specific situation under investigation . in realistic cases , @xmath27 is determined from geometry or from the duration of the shocked phase , or from the comparison between the time scales of acceleration and losses .",
    "here we consider it as a parameter to be fixed _ a priori_. from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure ] ) we can see that there is a maximum distance , corresponding to the propagation of particles with momentum @xmath27 such that at larger distances the fluid is unaffected by the accelerated particles and @xmath28 .",
    "assuming an adiabatic compression of the gas in the upstream region , we can write @xmath29 , where we used the conservation of mass , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) . the gas pressure far upstream is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the ratio of specific heats ( @xmath32 for an ideal gas ) and @xmath33 is the fluid mach number far upstream .",
    "note that the adiabaticity condition can not be applied at the shock jump , where the adiabaticity condition is clearly violated .",
    "after some algebra ( se @xcite for the details ) , the conservation equations imply the following equation : @xmath34\\ ] ] @xmath35 + 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{inj}}\\right ) -\\ ] ] @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and we put @xmath39 . solving this differential equation provides @xmath40 and therefore the spectrum of accelerated particles , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : implicit ] ) .",
    "the operative procedure for the calculation of the spectrum of accelerated particles is simple : we fix the boundary condition at @xmath41 such that @xmath42 for some value of @xmath5 ( fluid velocity at @xmath10 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath14 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nobel ] ) .",
    "the physical solution must have @xmath44 because at @xmath45 there are no accelerated particles to contribute any pressure .",
    "there is a unique value of @xmath5 for which the fluid velocity at the prescribed maximum momentum @xmath27 is @xmath46 . finding this value of @xmath5",
    "completely solves the problem , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : nobel ] ) provides @xmath40 and therefore the spectrum of accelerated particles .",
    "1 illustrates the distribution function ( multiplied by @xmath47 ) for mach number at infinity @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 and for @xmath51 ( solid line ) , @xmath52 ( dotted line ) and @xmath53 ( dashed line ) , where @xmath54 is the mass of the accelerated particles .",
    "the superimposed symbols show the corresponding results for the method in @xcite .",
    "( solid line and crosses ) , @xmath52 ( dotted line and stars ) and @xmath53 ( dashed line and diamonds.,width=302,height=226 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we plotted the results of our method for another set of parameters ( indicated in the figure ) and compared these results with the output of numerical simulations reported in @xcite .",
    "it can be easily seen that the agreement is impressive .",
    "we report on a novel semi - analytical approach to non linear shock acceleration , which improves some previous attempts of other authors .",
    "this method is in good agreement with the previous approaches , and is also in impressive agreement with the results of numerical simulations on shock acceleration .",
    "an extensive sets of predictions of this approach and a more complete comparison with previous results are presented in @xcite .",
    "the most important phenomenological consequence of the inclusion of the non linear effects in shock acceleration is the hardening of particle spectra , which may reflect in a corresponding hardening of the spectra of secondary particles ( photons , electrons and neutrinos ) generated in the interactions of the accelerated particles with the environment ."
