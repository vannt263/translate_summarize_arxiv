    "@xcite reached the same conclusion for otp , and obtained and tested the gaussian - linear harmonic ( denoted glh ) equation of state . with these approximations , @xmath36 the pressure has the form @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 the _ is _ energy reaches a high-@xmath3 plateau , @xmath39 , and , correspondingly , @xmath40 .",
    "the @xcite `` potential energy landscape equation of state '' , evaluated via computer simulation , was shown to accurately reproduce the true pressure for a range of liquid - state @xmath20 and @xmath3 in otp . here",
    "we attempt to reach some more general conclusions .",
    "we identify the origin of the van der waals equation in the _ is _ formalism , and obtain expressions for density - dependent `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath2 '' coefficients .",
    "there is an additional contribution , @xmath41 in the glh approximation , which we call the `` landscape pressure '' .",
    "the resulting extended van der waals equation has the possibility of yielding a water - like density anomaly ( already pointed out by sciortino et al .",
    "@xcite ) , flat isotherms in the coexistence region , as opposed to _",
    "vdw _ loops , a positive derivative @xmath42 at high density , and a critical anomaly in @xmath43 .",
    "we make use of the glh approximation but also derive results independent of any assumptions about the vibrational free energy .",
    "relevant _ pel _ quantities are determined by computer simulations on the single - component lj fluid for a wide range of densities including the coexistence region .",
    "fits to the data lead to to an analytic equation of state .",
    "in the _ vdw _ equation the pressure , @xmath44 is a sum of a @xmath3-independent term and a linear term . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the well known coefficients expressing the reduction of @xmath45 from the ideal gas value by the attractive forces and the increase due to repulsions , respectively .",
    "_ 1 . the gaussian linear harmonic ( glh ) approximation _    identification of the attractive and repulsive - ideal gas contributions with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is obvious , and holds up upon further consideration .",
    "the standard expression is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total energy . in the glh approximation , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . in general",
    "the derivative is @xmath3-dependent but the plateau value , @xmath52 , is a function of density only .",
    "thus ( eq  [ pc ] ) we propose a density - dependent extended _ vdw _ @xmath1 coefficient @xmath53 and the less familiar _ is _ energy is related to a textbook parameter .",
    "the _ vdw _ repulsive / ideal gas pressure is conventionally derived from the entropy . in the glh approximation it is easy to see that eq  [ pt ] just involves the derivative of the total entropy / particle , @xmath54 , and we propose @xmath55 with a density - dependent @xmath2 coefficient . since the entropy is evaluated on the plateau , @xmath47 is @xmath3-independent .",
    "the contribution to the pressure is @xmath56 , with the explicit multiplicative factor coming from the way entropy enters the free energy , @xmath57 .",
    "it might seem that harmonic oscillations have nothing to do with the molecular congestion that increases the pressure at high density , but the density dependence of @xmath58 is entirely due to the change in the shape of the basins , expressed through the frequencies , and that is relevant to packing .",
    "eq  [ b ] does not look terribly transparent . for clarification",
    "consider that , if @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a @xmath20-independent constant , and if for now we let @xmath2 be @xmath20-independent as well , the _ vdw _ @xmath47 is obtained .",
    "eq  [ st ] is plausible , with entropy / particle properly varying as @xmath61 at low density and vanishing as `` close packing '' is approached , @xmath62 .",
    "specifically , @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath64 .",
    "however real molecules with soft cores retain positive entropy as they are compressed to very high density , so any vanishing of @xmath65 must be understood as an extrapolation from a particular density range .",
    "we anticipate that @xmath66 defined in eq  [ b ] will decrease at high @xmath20 , keeping the entropy positive and the pressure finite .",
    "this expectation will be explicitly realized in sec  [ lj ] .",
    "there is considerable interest @xcite in the variation of the parameter @xmath67 , which determines the total number of _ is _ , with density and from substance to substance . if the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath67 ( via @xmath68 ) dominates that of @xmath63 , @xmath69    thus , the free energy evaluated on the high-@xmath3 plateau of the _ pel _ yields an equation of state with more complicated density dependence than the _ vdw _ equation , but the same @xmath3-dependence .",
    "the extended version also takes into account the deviation of @xmath70 from its plateau value , measured by @xmath71 . in the glh approximation , where @xmath72 , this gives rise to @xmath73 . with no density",
    "dependent vibrational energy @xmath74 is the entire relevant energy drop , and it also controls @xmath75 via @xmath76 ; everything is proportional to @xmath29 . adding the landscape pressure yields the extended _ vdw _ equation in the glh approximation , @xmath77    _ 2 . beyond the glh approximation _",
    "simulation shows that the glh expression for @xmath70 is only a crude representation ; what is the source of the error ?",
    "the gaussian approximation has no upper or lower bound on possible _ is _ energies , but is a good representation for the contributing fluid - like states over a substantial range of @xmath3 and @xmath20 , and has @xcite some theoretical justification .",
    "the harmonic approximation is valid for a particular normal coordinate when the system remains close to the _ is_. this suggests high density , where in fact the harmonic @xmath70 is better , and deterioration as @xmath20 is decreased towards the coexistence region . the imaginary frequency instantaneous normal modes @xcite , whose number correlates @xcite very well with the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath78 and increases with decreasing density , are completely anharmonic vibrational coordinates .",
    "thus we aim to retain a gaussian density of states , but to abandon the linear harmonic approximation for @xmath10 .",
    "deriving specific expressions for @xmath10 is a current focus of our research but we will now just try to draw some simple , general conclusions .",
    "the true @xmath70 does reach a high-@xmath3 plateau .",
    "accordingly , we rewrite the free energy , @xmath79 \\nonumber \\hspace{0 in }   \\\\ - [ d\\phi(t,\\rho)-k_{b}td\\phi^{2}(t,\\rho)/2\\delta^{2}]-[a_{v } ( \\phi_{\\infty},t,\\rho)-   \\nonumber \\hspace{.2 in }   \\\\ a_{v } ( \\phi(t,\\rho),t,\\rho)-k_{b}t ( \\phi_{0}-\\phi_{\\infty})d\\phi(t,\\rho)/\\delta^{2 } ] ,   \\hspace{.4 in } \\label{a3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] suppressing the @xmath20-dependence of the constants @xmath80 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "eq  [ a3 ] has three distinct groups of terms , enclosed by square brackets .",
    "the first group is the plateau free energy , which yields @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the glh approximation , the second group describes the effect of the drop of @xmath70 from the plateau and becomes the landscape pressure @xmath41 in the glh , and the third group vanishes in the glh .    as a first step",
    "consider the form @xmath81 then , @xmath82 eq  [ av ] is hardly the most general possibility but it does include linear @xmath8-dependence of both the vibrational energy and entropy , while the linear harmonic approximation has nontrivial entropy only ( @xmath83 , eq  [ phit1 ] ) .",
    "of course , a function of @xmath3 only does not influence @xmath45 or @xmath70 . with the gaussian ,",
    "eq  [ av ] constitutes the gaussian linear ( gl ) approximation .    returning to eq  [ a3 ] , the first group of terms now contains the total ( configurational plus vibrational ) energy and entropy on the plateau .",
    "the vibrational entropy terms in the third group still cancel but the deviation @xmath84 of the vibrational energy from the plateau value survives , and combines with @xmath85 in the second group to form the deviation of the total energy from the plateau value . the new contribution @xmath84 will vanish as the harmonic approximation becomes accurate , i.e , high density .",
    "evaluating the second group with eq  [ phit2 ] , the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath45 is unchanged from the glh approximation and @xmath86 the corresponding gl extended _ vdw _ equation is @xmath87 eq  [ b ] still holds for @xmath2 , but @xmath88    a more general treatment of anharmonicity is necessary to discuss densities , including the liquid - gas coexistence range , where @xmath70 is not described by eq  [ phit2 ] . in the glh and gl approximations",
    "there is no characteristic temperature at which the plateau is reached ; @xmath74 vanishes smoothly as @xmath89 .",
    "simulation , however , shows @xcite an identifiable `` top of the landscape '' temperature @xcite , @xmath90 , at typical liquid densities . considering the exact eq  [ a3 ] for the free energy ,",
    "if we assume that true plateau quantities are available , they will yield @xmath46 and @xmath47 according to eqs  [ pc2 ] and  [ pt2 ] .",
    "it is not terribly difficult to obtain the true @xmath70 from computer simulation , so let us also consider that it is known ; then the second group can be evaluated .",
    "the third group , with its cancellations , is less certain . in the gl approximation it converted @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "if we assume that happens more generally we obtain a third gaussian - anharmonic extended _ vdw _ equation of state @xmath93 the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by eqs  [ a2 ] and  [ b ] , respectively , with the understanding that the true thermodynamic functions are to be employed . their properties , and the behavior of @xmath70 ,",
    "implicitly incorporate the effect of an anharmonic @xmath10 upon the pressure .",
    "again , the argument is that , since the glh approximation for @xmath91 can be quite poor , the most important step is to correct the contributions to @xmath45 which directly reflect @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "contributions evaluated on the plateau are left in the extended _ vdw _ form .",
    "they also contain anharmonic effects implicitly through any non - glh behavior of @xmath94 and @xmath95 when they are evaluated , e.g , via simulation .",
    "the extended _ vdw _ equation has density - dependent @xmath1 and @xmath2 coefficients , but its most striking feature is the landscape pressure , in which we now include the @xmath84 contribution , with a new @xmath3-dependence .",
    "this term is @xmath96 in the glh and gl approximations , has a more general form in eq  [ evdw3 ] , and physically expresses the effect on the pressure of the descent of the system from the high-@xmath3 plateau in the _ is _ energy .",
    "thus we have a _ pel_-based criterion : the extended _ vdw _ equation should provide a good representation of thermodynamic states corresponding to the plateau . in the angell classification of liquids on a strong - fragile scale @xcite , the more complex behavior of fragile liquids is associated with a more pronounced drop @xmath91 from the plateau . thus we further suggest that the ordinary vdw equation should be most useful for strong liquids .    _",
    "1 . isotherms _    perhaps the most - discussed features of the _ vdw _ equation are the loops in the isotherms below the critical temperature @xmath97 they are a property of the metastable or unstable homogeneous fluid in the coexistence region .",
    "there is no provision in the _ vdw _ equation for the phase separation which goes hand in hand with the true , flat isotherms .",
    "there are two possibilities upon crossing the liquid - gas coexistence curve , @xmath98 , from above in the ( @xmath99 ) plane : the system may phase separate in thermal equilibrium , or it may remain a metastable , homogeneous fluid . similarly , above the triple point density , cooling below the melting temperature may lead to liquid - solid phase separation or a metastable supercooled liquid . at a given density",
    ", there will exist _ is _ representative of all the possible thermodynamic states . under the coexistence curve",
    ", there will be both homogeneous fluid and phase - separated liquid - gas and gas - solid _",
    "is_. above the triple point density the _ is _ types will be homogeneous liquid , liquid - solid phase separated , and crystal with varying amounts of disorder . due to surface effects , phase - separated _ is _ may be difficult to observe , and/or modified in character , in finite-_n _ simulation . a _ pel_-based calculation in a metastable state is achieved by including only the _ is _ to which the system is restricted , while equilibrium results from keeping all the _ is_.    phase separation causes a large drop in @xmath70 , or a strong increase in @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand @xmath74 varies more gently when the system remains homogeneous .",
    "thus the landscape pressure in eq  [ evdw3 ] behaves quite differently for the two cases .",
    "we suggest that it is small for homogeneous states , making the extended _ vdw _ equation a good approximation , but is large and _ leads to flat isotherms _ if phase separated states are included in the evaluation of @xmath74 .",
    "to demonstrate this idea , let phase separation at a given @xmath20 , and the corresponding strong growth in @xmath74 , begin at @xmath98 . for @xmath100 , the distance to the coexistence curve , @xmath101 , is an increasing function of @xmath20 for @xmath102 and a decreasing function for @xmath103 ; the density derivative changes from positive to negative at @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath74 is a monotonic function of @xmath101 , its derivative @xmath105 will have the same behavior .",
    "then the landscape pressure will be negative below @xmath104 and positive above , i.e. it will form a _",
    "van der waals anti - loop _ which can cancel the _ vdw _ loop and produce a flat isotherm .    as an illustration only ,",
    "consider the simple anzatz @xmath106 , with @xmath107 estimated from the ordinary _ vdw _ equation .",
    "we use @xmath20-independent @xmath1=4 and @xmath2=1 for an approximate description of the lj fluid and , since the growth of @xmath74 is the physical effect of interest , ignore @xmath108 .",
    "all quantities are expressed in natural lj units .",
    "the landscape pressure is nonzero within the _ vdw _ coexistence curve only , so we assume it does not change the critical point from @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "fig  [ iso ] shows _ vdw _ and extended _ vdw _ isotherms at @xmath111 for the choices @xmath112=1.91 , @xmath29=1 .",
    "we do not claim to have the correct @xmath91 but the point is that any model in which its growth begins at the coexistence curve will yield an anti - loop and potentially a flat isotherm .",
    "_ 2 . some thermodynamic derivatives _",
    "there is considerable current interest in the phenomonon of a negative @xmath113 , the `` density anomaly '' well known in water , which may or may not be associated @xcite with the existence of multiple critical points .",
    "some textbook manipulations show that equivalent conditions are @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the _ vdw _ equation can not have a density anomaly , since @xmath116 but things are quite different @xcite when the landscape pressure is added . in the gl approxination , @xmath117 and",
    "thus , if the density derivative is negative and large enough , thwre will be an anomaly .",
    "a more complicated condition can be expressed with the true @xmath74 via eq  [ evdw3 ] .",
    "there exists a clear physical interpretation of why the extended _ vdw _ equation can have a density anomaly .",
    "one expects that entropy should decrease with increasing density ( positive @xmath118 ) , as the system becomes more congested , but this is only true on the high-@xmath3 plateau where @xmath65 is a maximum . in the gl approximation ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath70 from the plateau at constant @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath29 decreases with increasing density , the system gets closer to the maximum plateau entropy , which may compensate for the decrease in @xmath119 itself , leading to @xmath120 and @xmath114 .    for the _ vdw _ equation the energy decreases with increasing density ;",
    "the relation @xmath121 yields @xmath122 , corresponding to the negative energy of attraction .",
    "this is because repulsions enter via the entropy only , i.e , there is no true positive repulsive energy contribution to the pressure , no matter how high the density . in the extended",
    "_ vdw _ equation , @xmath123 can ( sec  [ lj ] ) become large and positive , corresponding to a large negative @xmath124 , at high density ; the `` _ vdw _ attractive '' term then transforms into a repulsive pressure .",
    "furthermore , taking the landscape pressure into account , in the gl approximation , @xmath125 which can possibly change sign for the same reason given in the last paragraph for the density anomaly .",
    "the critical behavior of the heat capacity is described @xcite by the exponents @xmath67 and @xmath126 , @xmath127 in the _ vdw _ approximation @xcite , @xmath67=@xmath126= 0 .",
    "since we are obtaining @xmath45 from the free energy the simplest consistent route to @xmath49 is also through @xmath17 ; elementary statistical mechanics yields the exact relation @xmath128 where the notation is intended to convey that the derivative acts on the explicit @xmath3-dependence of @xmath10 only , not on that which enters implicitly through @xmath70 . for an equation of state based upon a particular approximation to @xmath10 , use of that approximation in",
    "eq  [ u ] yields the corresponding potential energy . since the _ vdw _ equation is obtained by ignoring the deviations of @xmath8 and @xmath129 from their plateau values in @xmath10 , strong @xmath3-dependence of @xmath130 is discarded .",
    "that is why @xmath67=@xmath126= 0 ; the critical anomaly is in the landscape term .",
    "here we present some preliminary results on lj . a careful study of phase",
    "equilibria @xcite determined that the critical point and triple point are @xmath104=0.31 , @xmath131=1.31 and @xmath132=0.84 , @xmath133=0.75 , lj units .",
    "an estimate of @xmath134 , determined from @xmath70 , _ n=256 _",
    ", is shown in fig  [ tol ] , along with the coexistence curve from ref  @xcite .",
    "a minimum is found near the triple point density , and with decreasing density @xmath134 runs between the liquid - gas spinodal and coexistence curve to the critical point .",
    "earlier we discussed the liquid - gas coexistence temperature , @xmath107 , as marking the onset of a rapid rise in @xmath74 ; @xmath107 is a `` _ tol _ '' temperature for _ equilibrium _ states .",
    "practically , the metastable homogeneous phase can survive until the spinodal is reached , and our result is expected in finite - size simulation .",
    "what may be interesting is that the liquid - gas spinodal and the _ tol _ temperature discussed in supercooled liquids , found at densities above the minimum , are thus connected .",
    "leyvraz and klein @xcite have suggested that properties of supercooled liquids may be influenced by a spinodal .",
    "we have obtained @xmath135 and @xmath94 ( fig  [ del2 ] ) for 2.0@xmath136@xmath20@xmath1360.20 , _ n=500 _ , from the distribution of _ is _ visited at high @xmath3 , where @xmath29 becomes @xmath3-independent , and from @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "starting at low density both quantities , like @xmath90 , decrease to minmium values near the triple point , and then begin to rise .",
    "similar behavior has been observed @xcite for the _ is _ pressure .",
    "correspondingly the _ vdw _ attractive term becomes a positive , repulsive pressure . in the glh approximation",
    "the behavior of @xmath135 would cause the landscape pressure to vanish near the triple point , identifying a region well described by the extended _ vdw _ equation .    the higher the density , the better we expect the harmonic approximation to perform .",
    "thus we are going to use our data to evaluate the glh equation of state over the entire available density range , but but we do not make any claims of validity at low to intermediate density .",
    "fitting @xmath135 and @xmath94 to a sum of two exponentials gives good fits , particularly at high density , 2.0@xmath136@xmath20@xmath1361.2 .",
    "taking density derivatives yields @xmath46 ( @xmath124 ) and the landscape pressure @xmath41 .",
    "we do not at the moment have the information necessary to calculate @xmath66 from first principles .",
    "this coefficient involves an extrapolation , i.e , in some small density range it appears that the pressure would diverge at a particular , higher `` close packed '' density , but since the cores are soft that density is never reached .",
    "consequently @xmath2 may appear to be constant at low density , but its @xmath20-dependence becomes essential at high density .",
    "it is difficult to equilibrate the system at @xmath20@xmath1371.2 without going to quite high @xmath3 .",
    "to get some idea of the behavior of @xmath2 we have calculated the @xmath3=25 isotherm , and @xmath66 from the glh eq  [ evdw1 ] .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ brho ] . because of the soft cores , the quantity @xmath138 can become small , but never zero .",
    "thus we suggest a plausible behavior is exponential decay with @xmath20 , giving @xmath139 and the smooth curve in fig  [ brho ] is eq  [ b1rho ] with @xmath140=1.31 . combining everything , @xmath141 anticipating that the analog of the _ vdw _ attractive term will be positive , and the landscape term negative .",
    "matching the @xcite true @xmath104 and @xmath131 of lj to the _ vdw _ equation gives @xmath2=1.07 and @xmath1=4.73 at the critical density we find @xmath142=4.92 ( negative of first parenthesis in eq  [ hiro ] ) and ( eq  [ b1rho ] ) @xmath66=1.08 .",
    "again , we expect the missing anharmonicity to be important at the critical density and regard these results with some skepticism , but the agreement is remarkable .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath1 , along with @xmath2 , is shown for @xmath143 in fig  [ abrho ] ; note the sign change near the triple point density .",
    "the equation of state is obtained from the density derivative of the helmholtz free energy , as always .",
    "approach simply provides a less traditional way to view the problem and generate approximations . since a gaussian approximation for the _ is _ energy distribution is reasonable",
    ", the focus is on the vibrational free energy @xmath10 .",
    "the glh approximation was worked out @xcite by la nave et al . , and the starting point of this paper is simply the observation that their result resembles the van der waals equation with density - dependent @xmath1 and @xmath2 coefficients , and an extra `` landscape '' term .",
    "in addition , we have tried to include the anharmonicity of @xmath10 with as few assumptions as is possible ; in the extended _ vdw _ eq  [ evdw3 ] , anharmonicity is implicit in the @xmath3-dependent inherent structure energy , and in the plateau entropy",
    ". the smaller the drop of the _ is _ energy from its high-@xmath3 plateau , the smaller the landscape pressure , suggesting that the _ vdw _ equation is best suited to strong liquids .",
    "the extended equation can reproduce , and provide _ pel _ interpretations of , thermodynamic phenomena absent from the usual _ vdw _ equation .",
    "computer simulation in the lj fluid yields @xmath124 and @xmath66 . the @xmath1 coefficient becomes negative at @xmath144 , as the `` _ vdw _ attractive '' pressure becomes a repulsive pressure .",
    "the @xmath2 coefficient is represented by a simple expression stemming from the idea that the pressure may become exponentially large , but not infinite .",
    "since the harmonic approximation may be accurate at high density , the resulting analytic expression is suggested as a high density equation of state , which we will explore in future work .",
    "nevertheless , when evaluated at the critical density , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are remarkably close to the accepted values .",
    "the quantities @xmath94 and @xmath135 have minima near the triple point .",
    "thus in the glh approximation both @xmath46 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath41 ( landscape pressure ) vanish .",
    "the `` top of the landscape '' temperature also has a minimum near the triple point . at lower density @xmath134",
    "runs under the coexistence curve to the critical point , at higher density it rises and becomes the quantity discussed @xcite for supercooled liquids ; this connection may support the conjecture @xcite of klein and leyvraz .",
