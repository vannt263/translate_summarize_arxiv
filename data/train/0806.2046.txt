    "ultra high energy neutrinos uhe @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at eev s up to gzk energies ( @xmath4 ev ) can hit the earth crust at the horizon leading to uhe @xmath5 which may decay in flight at high altitude .",
    "the consequent uhe air showers might be observable by next generation gamma - ray space missions like glast .",
    "here we show the expected fluence and time signature considering two different complementary signals : the upward @xmath5 air shower ( uptau ) near the vertical at pev energies and the horizontal @xmath5 air shower ( hortau ) at 1.4 10@xmath6 ev .      assuming a given altitude ( @xmath7 ) for the circular orbit of the satellite , the distance between the detector and the edge of the earth crust can be written as @xmath8}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the angle of the shower from the horizontal . in first approximation @xmath10    a pictorial view of the detection method",
    "is shown in figure  [ glastscheme1 ] .",
    "now we can calculate the area @xmath11 of the corresponding front of the upward @xmath5 showers that is given by :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the typical opening angle for showers .",
    "the lateral density profile is , of course , more dense near the inner part , and here we assume that @xmath14 of the gammas are contained in a narrow angle of @xmath15 of degree , leading to a reduces area :    @xmath16    this areas allow us to calculate the secondary gamma - ray flux .",
    "we considered @xmath17 s with a primary energy of the order of @xmath18 ev because at greater energies they are suppressed by the earth opacity , while at lower energies the cross section and the @xmath5 propagation length are smaller @xcite . indeed",
    "the probability @xmath19 of escaping from the earth is approximately @xmath20    where @xmath21 is nearly the complementary angle of the direction of the upcoming @xmath5 angle with the zenith , @xmath22 is the interaction length of the @xmath5 and @xmath23 is the @xmath24 interaction length .",
    "the @xmath5 energy is typically @xmath25 less then the @xmath17 one s .",
    "the number of gamma @xmath26 with energies around 100 mev in the showers is in first approximation @xmath27    for @xmath28 with the assumption of the energy equi - partition between @xmath29 , electron pairs ( @xmath30 33% each component ) , as well as taking in account a partial ( @xmath30 33% ) opacity of the atmosphere for the @xmath5 shower .",
    "the number of photons per unit reduced area at the altitude of glast is then :    @xmath31 in the inner@xmath32 core and @xmath33 in the wider @xmath34 cone shower .",
    "the characteristic time structure of the shower is @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the shower attenuation length at altitude @xmath37 , where upward @xmath5 take place .",
    "( see ref.@xcite ) .    assuming the lateral glast detector area , @xmath38 , an efficiency @xmath39 , the total effective area is @xmath40 the number of photons for each event is , respectively for narrow and large view angle :    @xmath41 @xmath42",
    "so we conclude that glast can measure upward @xmath5 only in coincidence with the grb monitor approximately one over 6 upward @xmath5 showers .",
    "therefore the high energy @xmath29 detection alone is not an effective way to discriminate upward tau air - showers ( uptaus ) by glast .",
    "we can now use the above procedure to calculate the rate of events for the horizontal @xmath5 air shower .",
    "the distance between the detector and the edge of the earth crust is in this case    @xmath43 km for the same altitude of 575 km and where the angle of the shower from the horizontal is @xmath44 .",
    "however the tau decay in flight and the hortau appearence takes place at great distance ( @xmath45 km ) from the earth and the hortau shower has a characteristic distance of ( @xmath46 km ) making the real distance from the shower front to the satellite reduced to @xmath47 km .",
    "now we can calculate the area of the corresponding front of the showers given by : @xmath48 this area is comparable with future auger experiment area . in analogy to previous uptaus scenario we also consider inner shower cone of a nominal beam angle @xmath49 of degree obtaining a reduced area @xmath50 .",
    "this areas allow us to calculate the secondary gamma - ray flux .",
    "the optimal observable primary neutrino energy is 1.1 @xmath51 ev because of the earth crust slant depth combined with the horizontal atmospheric opacity @xcite .",
    "the number of gamma @xmath52 with energies around 100 mev in the showers is in first approximation @xmath53 with the same assumption of the energy equi - partition between @xmath29 , electron pairs but without the opacity of the atmosphere for the @xmath5 shower because in this case we are at the maximum of the shower with nearly no atmospheric suppression .",
    "the number of photons per unit area ( or reduced area ) at the altitude of glast is then :    @xmath54 @xmath55    the characteristic time structure of the shower is @xmath56    where @xmath57 km , is the shower attenuation length at high altitude @xmath58 km , where air is much diluted ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "assuming as before the lateral area of the detector @xmath59 , an efficiency @xmath39 , the total effective area is @xmath60 the number of photons for each event is for @xmath61 :    @xmath62 @xmath63      the number of events may be estimated by scaling the euso experiment event rate at the horizons , keeping care of the different beaming angle and of the different horizontal area and duty cycle life - time @xmath64 respect the glast one @xmath65 , for a nominal three years of recording .",
    "these event rate are scaled assuming a minimal , guaranteed gzk ( greisen , zatsepin , kuzmin ) neutrino fluence @xmath66 produced by observed ultra high cosmic rays , uhecr , during their photopion scattering on cosmic big bang radiation within the gzk cut - off volumes : @xmath67    the consequent reduced area ( narrower beamed ) event number is :    @xmath68      among these upward - horizontal showers by @xmath5 we must consider the competitive signals of more common and known uhecr showers at horizons : horizontal high altitude shower hias ( @xcite ) are observed by satellites above the horizons ( @xmath69 ) and they behave as a background signal respect to hortau below the horizons ( @xmath70 ) . indeed their event number in three years ( at the same gzk energies @xmath71 ev , and flux @xmath72 as in previous section : @xmath73 ev ) is @xmath74 the consequence of this expected signal above the horizons is the necessary presence of a background ultra high cosmic rays at a rate comparable to present agasa and hires records .",
    "the very natural advantage is the general calibration of this uhecr physics on ground with this high quota showering in space .",
    "the drawback is the need of a clear angle discriminator between hortaus and hias . because at the distances we are dealing",
    "the split angle is nearly one degree we may expect that a dozen or more gamma events will be enough to estimate the arrival direction within a needed accuracy ( a few tenth of degree ) . in summary",
    "the glast thresholds are described in the included figure below .",
    "the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast)@xcite , has been selected by nasa as a mission involving an international collaboration of particle physics and astrophysics communities from the united states , italy , japan , france and germany for a launch in the first half of 2006 .",
    "the main scientific objects are the study of all gamma ray sources such as blazars , gamma - ray bursts , supernova remnants , pulsars , diffuse radiation , and unidentified high - energy sources .",
    "many years of refinement has led to the configuration of the apparatus shown ( see figure  [ glastscheme2 ] ) , where one can see the 4x4 array of identical towers each formed by : @xmath75 si - strip tracker detectors and converters arranged in 18 xy tracking planes for the measurement of the photon direction .",
    "@xmath75 segmented array of csi(tl ) crystals for the measurement the photon energy .",
    "@xmath75 segmented anticoincidence detector ( acd ) .",
    "the main characteristics are an energy range between 20 mev and 300 gev , a field of view of @xmath30 3 sr , an energy resolution of @xmath30 5% at 1 gev , a point source sensitivity of 2x10@xmath76 ( ph  @xmath77  s@xmath78 ) at 0.1 gev , an event deadtime of 20 @xmath79 and a peak effective area of 10000 @xmath80 , for a required power of 600 w and a payload weight of 3000 kg .",
    "the list of the people and the institution involved in the collaboration together with the on - line status of the project is available at _ http://www - glast.stanford.edu_. the important number for our estimate is the lateral area of the tracker for each of the four sides that is @xmath81 .",
    "the projected total area is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the angle between the arrival @xmath5 shower and the horizon constrained by the geometry of the servicing modules that do not allowed to see upward showers ( see figure  [ glastscheme2 ] )",
    "the gamma - ray space experiment glast is just in orbit .",
    "its clear detection of cosmic rays secondaries , mostly single gamma and electron pairs as well as muons must take place at a high rate ( thousands of events a year ) .",
    "most muons pairs will hit the detector at 400 gev energies .",
    "more rare bundle of x-@xmath29 and @xmath84 tev @xmath85 as well as uhe ( tens gev ) neutrons ( with and without gamma - x traces ) might be also observable soon .",
    "pevs - eevs cosmic rays air - showering at the terrestrial atmosphere edge must occur at daily - weekly rate in glast .",
    "the first neutron - gamma - electrons and or muon - gamma - electrons at associated bundles must flash soon opening a new road to uhecr astrophysics .",
    "moreover with a high angular resolution ( below @xmath86)it might be even possible in a future to reveal first eev persistent gamma source as well as rarest pevs - eevs upgoing tau .",
    "this signals are to be distinguished from background noises whose single event or whose rare pair structure in different from rarest ( tens ) bundles of x - gamma - muons or x - gamma neutron burst at 0.1 millisecond time structure .",
    "this upgoing airshowers will be the most exciting signal of the long waited uhe neutrino astronomy .",
    "similar results , but an order of magnitude below , maybe applied to agile detector .",
