    "the physics of atomic nuclei and nuclear systems is very rich but extremely complicated to describe .",
    "it unites many of the toughest aspects of the quantum many body problem in a single spot . to name only a few",
    ", we can mention the existence of four different types of fermions ( proton / neutron - spin up / down ) , the relevance of pairing and quartet correlations in the dynamics , or the role of the mean field approach as a first order approximation while quantum fluctuations are very important as a consequence of the smallness of nuclei .",
    "moreover , the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force is very complicated with its hard core , tensor ( dipolar ) components and strong spin orbit interactions .",
    "it is remarkable that nuclear theory has nowadays mastered a great deal of those challenges and many of the experimental data are very well described either on a phenomenological basis , or , more rarely , with microscopic approaches . in this work",
    "we try to progress with the latter strategy .",
    "theories aiming towards a global description of low energy nuclear data always start with a mean field description and a semi - phenomenological nuclear energy density functional . in a recent paper @xcite , we proposed an approach slightly different from the usual for the establishment of a nuclear energy density functional .",
    "we tried to follow as much as possible the kohn - sham ( ks ) @xcite density functional theory ( dft ) , which is based on the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite , and is of common use , e.g. , in atomic and molecular physic @xcite .",
    "the ks method introduces a set of auxiliary single - particle states and takes for the kinetic energy the slater form in this basis . in the ks method the energy density functional is written as a sum of two terms .",
    "one of them corresponds to the uncorrelated kinetic energy density plus the direct contribution derived from the underlying two body ( coulomb ) interaction .",
    "the other piece contains an unknown term for the exchange and correlation energies .",
    "for a practical implementation of the method , the latter term has to be guessed and therefore many strategies have been developed along the years to describe different physical phenomena .",
    "a popular strategy in atomic and molecular physics is to use accurate theoretical calculations ( mainly by monte - carlo techniques ) as a function of the density in simplified models where finite size effects are neglected",
    ". the results of those calculations are used to make an educated guess of the unknown exchange and correlation part of the functional in the real system . in this way",
    "the minimization procedure gives hartree - like equations for the single - particle states , where the potential part includes in an effective way the overall exchange and correlation contribution .",
    "the application of the ks - dft scheme to self - bound systems like atomic nuclei is not straightforward , because of the absence of a external confining potential .",
    "the usual procedure used with skyrme functionals has been justified recently @xcite by reformulating the problem in the",
    " intrinsic \" system .    in nuclear physics to build up the exchange and correlation contribution amounts to a detailed determination of the ground state of symmetric nuclear matter and of neutron matter to be used as a guide for finite nuclei energy density functionals .",
    "accurate nuclear matter calculations are very complicated and not as much advanced as for electron systems of condensed matter .",
    "nonetheless , in recent years , quite some progress has been achieved and we will build our ks - dft approach on the equation of state ( eos ) of baldo et al . , developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the well known hole line expansion .",
    "this eos is calculated from realistic two body and three body interactions treated at the brueckner hartree - fock level .",
    "it is compatible with phenomenological constraints coming from data of heavy ion reactions @xcite as well as from the analysis of astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that only two works exist which tried to follow the same strategy as here , one by fayans @xcite and the other by steiner et al @xcite .",
    "however , they are based on a somewhat older eos @xcite .",
    "the functional obtained will be used to describe finite nuclei at the mean field level concentrating on the binding energy systematic . therefore , it is important to include beyond mean field effects having a strong impact on binding energies and not present in nuclear matter .",
    "the most obvious one is the correlation energy associated to symmetry restoration that will be accounted for in the case of translational and rotational invariance .    a different approach to nuclear energy density functional ( edf )",
    "was developed on the basis of the chiral two- and three body forces @xcite .",
    "the final form of the edf contains a set of contact interactions , similar to the skyrme functionals , with a corresponding set of about a dozen of parameters .",
    "this part is supplemented by a contribution coming from pion exchanges , which is non - local and treated through the density matrix expansion procedure .",
    "preliminary calculations @xcite on a selected set of nuclei show a slight improvement with respect to the standard skyrme functionals and open a promising prospect for large - scale fitting procedures .",
    "the reason for such an intense focus on an accurate theoretical description of bulk properties of nuclei all over the nuclide chart is discussed for instance in @xcite : many physical scenarios involve neutron rich nuclei which are far from reach from an experimental point of view and therefore reliable theoretical predictions are the only possible option at present .",
    "the present status is that good agreement between different theoretical models is to be expected as long as we do not move towards the neutron drip line , a region of relevance in stellar nucleo - synthesis processes .",
    "therefore , a new model based on somewhat different ideas closer to the ks - dft approach than the more traditional skyrme - like edf ( inspired by contact central potentials ) , can help to clarify the uncertainties associated to present - day models .    in the present work ,",
    "a ks approach based on the same microscopic bulk input as in @xcite will be used for the particle- hole channel .",
    "however , we will be able to reduce the number of parameters by two without losing accuracy .",
    "as before , we will consider an additional bulk parameter for a precise adjustment of the numerically obtained e / a value .",
    "however , for the surface , we will reduce the number of parameters from three to one by the condition that , in infinite symmetric and infinite pure neutron matter , the strength parameters of the finite range term reproduce the coefficients of the quadratic terms of the bulk energy density obtained from the microscopic calculation .",
    "therefore , no subtraction term in the finite range part as in @xcite is necessary .",
    "the range @xmath0 of the surface term remains the only adjustable parameter , see the more detailed discussion below . although there are , together with the strength of the spin - orbit term , three parameters in the particle - hole channel , we want to emphasize that the most relevant are the ones from bulk and surface .",
    "we stress this point , because it seems to us a reduction to two basic physical inputs to the binding energy of nuclei : energy per particle of infinite matter and surface energy ! that this is possible is as much surprising as it is gratifying !",
    "it also should be mentioned that the adjustment of those two parameters is extremely sensitive : both have to be fine tuned to the order of @xmath1 ! this sensitivity points to a well defined physical content of the parameters .    it should be pointed out , however , that ks - dft addresses only the ground state and is , in principle , not tailored to describe excited states of the system .",
    "nevertheless , we will also use it for the description of the giant monopole resonances ( gmr s ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the following section is devoted to briefly recall our previous bcp functional . in the third section , the new energy density functional built up in this paper is discussed .",
    "the results obtained with this improved functional , that we will call bcpm ( barcelona - catania - paris - madrid ) , are also presented in the same section .",
    "the predictive power of the bcpm functional regarding other observable such as charge radii , quadrupole and octupole deformations and fission barriers are discussed in the fourth section . the ability of the bcpm functional for describing the isoscalar giant monopole resonance is the subject of the fifth section .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the former bcp functional was proposed in ref .",
    "this and subsequent refinements @xcite are based on the kohn - sham density functional theory ( ks - dft ) where the one body density @xmath2 plays a central role . in the ks - dft theory an auxiliary set of @xmath3 orthonormal wave functions @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the mass number , is introduced to express formally the density as if it were obtained from a slater determinant as a sum of the product of single particle wave functions @xmath5 with the @xmath6 s determined from the minimization of the ground state energy . in condensed matter and atomic physics",
    "the energy density functional @xmath7 $ ] is usually split into two parts @xcite : @xmath8 + w[\\rho].\\ ] ] the first piece @xmath9 $ ] corresponds to the uncorrelated kinetic energy written in the usual manner as @xmath10 the other piece , @xmath11 $ ] , contains the potential energy and the correlated part of the kinetic energy . in the bcp family of functionals",
    "this part is given as the sum of spin - orbit energy , the coulomb part and the nuclear energy term which depends on the neutron and proton densities @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "in nuclear physics , contrary to the situation in condensed matter and atomic physics , the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction to the energy functional is very important .",
    "non - local contributions have been included in dft in several ways long ago ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of this topic ) . in line with this , we split the spin - orbit part into an uncorrelated part @xmath14 plus a remainder not treated explicitly here .",
    "the form of the uncorrelated spin - orbit part is taken exactly as in typical skyrme @xcite or gogny forces @xcite .",
    "another piece that we explicitly split off is the coulomb part @xmath15 .",
    "we treat this contribution at lowest order , i.e. the direct term plus the exchange contribution in the slater approximation , that is @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 .    the nuclear energy functional contribution @xmath19 $ ] contains the nuclear potential energy as well as additional correlations .",
    "this contribution is divided into a finite range term @xmath20 $ ] to account for correct surface properties and a bulk correlation part @xmath21 $ ] that we take from one of the most advanced microscopically determined eos existing so far in the literature @xcite as mentioned before .",
    "collecting all these contributions our final ks - dft functional reads @xmath22 the functional is supplemented by a density dependent pairing interaction and some beyond mean field corrections ( see below ) .",
    "one of the prominent results of our recent work within the ks - dft bcp density functional scheme @xcite was that , with a very reduced number of adjustable parameters to finite nuclei , rms values for binding energies and radii came out to be of the same quality as the ones of some skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite functionals .",
    "the reduction of the number of parameters stemmed from the fact that , prior to a fit of the functional to nuclear masses , the bulk part of the functional @xmath23 was adjusted to the microscopic eos obtained in refs . @xcite by fitting polynomials in the total density @xmath24 to microscopic results in symmetric and pure neutron matter , followed by a quadratic interpolation in the asymmetry parameter @xmath25 between these two limits .",
    "the curve obtained in the polynomial fit can be slightly changed without changing significantly the mean square deviation to the microscopic eos . on the other hand , although the microscopic eos is state - of - the - art , the uncertainties in the underlying interaction and the ones attributed to the approximations involved translate to minor uncertainties in the computed points of the microscopic eos that will eventually lead to minor changes in the polynomial curve .",
    "we will exploit this limited freedom to produce polynomial fits with slightly different values of e / a at saturation ( around e / a=16 mev ) .",
    "the resulting edfs are then used in the finite nuclei fit ( see below ) and the one leading to the smallest binding energy rms is chosen . only changes of the order of a few hundred of kev in e / a are considered .",
    "the additional surface term in @xcite was of the form @xmath26   = & \\frac{1}{2 } & \\sum_{t , t'}\\!\\!\\iint \\!\\ !",
    "d { \\bf r } d { \\bf r}'\\rho_{t}({\\bf   r})v_{t , t'}({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}')\\rho_{t'}({\\bf r } ' ) \\\\ \\nonumber & - & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{t , t'}\\gamma_{t , t'}\\int d { \\bf r}\\rho_{t}({\\bf r})\\rho_{t'}({\\bf r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath27 is the label for neutron and proton , i.e. @xmath28 , and @xmath29 the volume integral of @xmath30 .",
    "the subtraction term was introduced not to contaminate the bulk part , determined from the microscopic infinite matter calculation . for the finite range form factor @xmath30",
    "a simple gaussian ansatz @xmath31 was made .",
    "the strength parameters were chosen to distinguish only between like and unlike particles , i.e. @xmath32",
    "so that the finite range term contained three adjustable parameters : @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "together with the adjustment of the bulk and the spin - orbit strength , the functional in @xcite has all in all five adjustable parameters , even though they are not all to be considered on the same level of significance .",
    "we will come back to these considerations later in the text where we also will show how to avoid the subtraction term in the finite range part of the energy .    in order to describe properly open shell nuclei",
    "one has to introduce pairing correlations .",
    "the formal way of including pairing within the dft is also known since long from the generalization of the hohenberg - kohn theorem to paired systems @xcite . in @xcite we have introduced pairing in our functional through the bcs approach using a zero - range density dependent interaction adjusted to reproduce the neutron gaps of the gogny force in symmetric nuclear matter with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the free parameters of the energy density functional reported in @xcite were fitted either to reproduce the binding energies of a few spherical nuclei or binding energies and charge radii of the same set of spherical nuclei .",
    "we called these functionals bcp1 or bcp2 ( barcelona - catania - paris ) , respectively .",
    "the predictive power of these functionals was illustrated by computing the binding energies and charge radii of 161 spherical nuclei between @xmath36ne and @xmath37u .",
    "we found that the rms in energy and charge radii are similar to the ones obtained with successful mean - field models such us the gogny d1s force @xcite , the skyrme sly4 interaction @xcite and the relativistic mean field parametrization nl3 @xcite .    in subsequent publications we explored the properties of bcp1 and bcp2 in describing quadrupole and octupole deformation ground state properties , fission , excited octupole states , etc @xcite . in dealing with deformed nuclei",
    "the most relevant beyond mean field effect , namely the rotational energy correction has been considered in an approximate way @xcite .",
    "also some other parametrizations of the functional based on fitting to the binding energy of deformed nuclei instead of the fitting to spherical nuclei , have been considered @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that for other energy density functionals , like the ones of the skyrme , gogny , or relativistic mean field type , the number of parameters seems much higher , typically more than ten . however , many of those parameters are implicitly used to get a reasonable nuclear matter and neutron matter equation of state .",
    "the advantage of our ks - dft procedure is that one clearly separates the tasks of reproducing the nuclear matter eos from the most prominent finite size effects , namely the surface and coulomb energies and the spin - orbit potential .",
    "following @xcite we write the bulk part of the energy density functional as @xmath38=\\int\\ !",
    "d{\\bf r } \\big[p_{s}(\\rho)(1-\\beta^{2 } ) + p_{n}(\\rho)\\beta^{2}\\big]\\rho\\label{eq : eq4a},\\ ] ] where the interpolating polynomials for symmetric and pure neutron matter , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , read @xmath41 where the reference densities are @xmath42=0.16 @xmath43 and @xmath44=0.155 @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "as compared to the former version of the bcp energy density functional , the fit of the microscopic eos has been redone in order to avoid some rather strong oscillatory behavior in the density - dependent incompressibility of the nuclear matter ( see section iv below ) when plotted as a function of density . to cure this unwanted effect ,",
    "the number of theoretical points is increased and a fifth order polynomial in the density is chosen for fitting the microscopic eos in symmetric nuclear matter in a wider range of densities , up to 0.625 @xmath43 , instead of the prescription given in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "furthermore special care has been paid to the smoothness not only of the fitted eos but also of the density - dependent incompressibility .",
    "this has been achieved by considering only polynomial fits with smooth high order derivatives with respect to the density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] the microscopic eos for nuclear and neutron matter as well as the corresponding polynomial fits are shown as function of the density . in the lower panel ,",
    "the symmetry energy computed using the polynomial fits as a function of the density is also displayed . as discussed in @xcite , the low density behavior of the microscopic nuclear matter eos",
    "has a characteristic trend , usually not reproduced by skyrme and gogny functionals ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , missing there quite a substantial part of binding .",
    "since we want to construct the ks - dft functional on the basis of the microscopic calculations , the bulk part @xmath23 of the functional , directly related to a realistic eos , is determined once and for all as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4a ] ) together with the local density approximation .",
    "however , as mentioned before slightly different polynomial interpolations with different values of e / a at saturation have been considered to improve the finite nuclei results for the binding energies .",
    "the saturation density has been kept fixed at the nominal value of 0.16 @xmath43 . for e / a at saturation",

    "/ a the complete fitting process for finite nuclei has been performed ( see below ) .",
    "the optimal value for the saturation energy per particle turns out to be 15.98 mev .",
    "the fine tuning of e / a at saturation is to be expected because of the extreme sensitivity of the mass of heavy nuclei to this parameter .",
    "in addition , as the fine tuning involves finite nuclei calculations where the surface term is included it can be considered as a way to account for the coupling of volume and surface in finite nuclei .",
    ".parameters ( in mev ) of the polynomial fits , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for symmetric and neutron matter , respectively .",
    "the reference densities are @xmath47 @xmath43 and @xmath48 @xmath43 .",

    "as far as we are including in our study tin and cadmium ( neglecting the effects of the small deformation ) isotopes and @xmath55sm , for which pairing correlations are essential to describe accurately the ground state , we discuss first the role of pairing in the sum rule approach used to estimate @xmath52 .",
    "the generalization of rpa to the case of nuclei with open shells when pairing correlations are active , is the quasi - particle rpa ( qrpa )",
    ". the so - called dielectric theorem , which justifies constrained calculations within qrpa to obtain the @xmath56 sum rule , has been proven recently by col and collaborators in @xcite .",
    "also khan et al have shown the validity of the thouless theorem for the energy weighted sum rule in the case of self - consistent qrpa based on hfb @xcite . as far as a simple generalization of the thouless theorem allows to obtain the @xmath57 sum rule @xcite",
    ", it can be expected that this also will be the case in the qrpa framework .",
    "in addition we have also numerically checked that the virial theorem , i.e. the stability against scale transformations of the wave - functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , is also fulfilled in the hfb approximation . from this discussion",
    "we may conclude that the sum rule approach can also be applied in the qrpa case .    in table",

    "the escape width ( [ eq21 ] ) lies in a window of 2 - 3 mev , pointing out that the monopole strength of the considered nuclei is mainly concentrated around well defined peaks .",
    "the influence of pairing correlations on @xmath52 has been discussed in earlier literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have repeated the scaled and constrained estimates of the @xmath52 switching off pairing and the corresponding results are reported in table [ t2 ] . comparing tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ]",
    "we notice that , when pairing correlations are taken into account ( table [ t1 ] ) , the @xmath54 and @xmath53 values in open shell nuclei slightly decrease as compared with the values obtained without pairing ( table [ t2 ] ) which in agreement with the results of refs .",
    "the effect of pairing correlations is , in general , more important in the constrained calculations than in the scaled ones , especially in half - filled major shell nuclei as it is the case of @xmath63sn , @xmath64sn , @xmath65sn , @xmath66cd , @xmath67cd , @xmath63cd .",
    "when the occupancy of the shell increases , as it happens in @xmath68sn , @xmath69sn , @xmath70sn , @xmath71sn , @xmath64cd and @xmath65cd , the influence of pairing is actually very small as it can be seen in table [ t2 ] .    in order to compare with the experiment , we will use as representative the constrained energy @xmath54 , which estimates the energy of the centroid in a very precise way at least in the case of the nucleus in @xmath58pb @xcite ( see also table iv of @xcite in this respect ) . from table",
    "[ t1 ] , we see that the experimental @xmath52 in @xmath58pb is very well reproduced by @xmath54 obtained using the bcpm energy density functional .",
    "the experimental excitation energies of @xmath59zr and @xmath55sm are slightly overestimated by the theoretical constrained calculation",
    ". however , our theoretical calculation are less successful in the case of the cadmium and tin isotopes .",
    "the predicted @xmath54 values are shifted by around 1 mev up as compared with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "this is a general tendency shown by mean - field models of different nature @xcite .",
    "several attempts to explain this behavior have been proposed in the past such as the density dependence of the incompressibility in neutron rich matter @xcite or different types of pairing interactions @xcite . however , no clear explanation has been found to date and the question why sn ( and cd ) isotopes are so soft is still an open problem .",
    "it may be that nonlinear effects coming from particle vibration coupling play a role in such nuclei as sn isotopes , since we reproduce the stiff doubly magic nucleus of @xmath58pb and not the semi - magic ones as , e.g. , the sn isotopes .    from the previous discussion it seems that the @xmath52 estimated with the bcpm functional are somewhat high as compared with the experiment in spite of its relatively low incompressibility modulus @xmath72=216 mev ( see table [ nmatter ] ) .",
    "the fact that effective mean field models with different values of @xmath72 can give similar values of @xmath52 in @xmath58pb has actually been a general puzzle in the past ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the reason is the proportionality between @xmath52 and the square root of @xmath73 found by blaizot @xcite for gogny forces .",
    "for example rmf approaches systematically lead to @xmath52 comparable to the ones obtained with non - relativistic theories like skyrme or gogny , in spite of the fact that @xmath73 values are appreciably larger in relativistic than in non relativistic approaches .",
    "some time ago col et al .",
    "@xcite showed that one can construct skyrme functionals that give reasonable values for @xmath52 but with relatively high values of @xmath73 i.e. values which approach the ones of rmf theories .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the underlying reason of this fact can be attributed to the different density dependence of the symmetry energy at , and around , saturation . in the same reference @xcite",
    "it is concluded that within non - relativistic models there is not a unique relation between the value of @xmath73 associated to a given model and the energy and the @xmath52 predicted by the same model .    to clarify this latest problem a very recent proposal of khan , margueron and vidaa @xcite may be useful .",
    "these authors analyzed a relatively large set of skyrme , gogny and rmf interactions finding that the corresponding density dependent incompressibilities @xmath74 defined in eq .",
    "( [ incomp ] ) show a crossing point at a density of about 75% of the saturation density .",
    "this crossing density corresponds roughly to the average density of a heavy nucleus defined as _ av = ^2 ( ) d .",
    "the authors claim that the excitation energy of finite nuclei is more properly correlated with the slope of incompressibility @xmath74 computed at the crossing density than with the incompressibility modulus computed at saturation density @xmath72 .",
    "this scenario is similar to the one found for the nuclear symmetry energy in bulk matter , which also shows a crossing point for a similar value of the density ( @xmath750.11 @xmath43 ) @xcite . in this case",
    "it is also found @xcite that the slope of the symmetry energy at the crossing density is linearly correlated with the neutron skin of a heavy nucleus , e.g. @xmath58pb . in general , the existence of a crossing point",
    "is actually related to the fact that the parameters of successful mean- field models have been fitted to reproduce properties of finite nuclei whose densities are , on the average , smaller than the saturation density .",
    "therefore , if an observable measured in finite nuclei is related to some property of nuclear matter , the correlation is better described at the average ( crossing ) density than at the saturation one @xcite .    following the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed the behavior of @xmath52 of @xmath58pb and @xmath59zr calculated using different mean field models as a function of the parameter @xmath76 defined as m = 3 _ _ av , which is directly related to the slope of the density dependent incompressibility @xmath74 at the crossing density @xmath77 . in our study in addition of the bcpm energy density functional , we have also considered the d1 and d1s gogny forces , the skm@xmath78 and t6 skyrme interactions and the rmf parametrizations nl1 , nl3 and nlsh . using these models the correlation between the scaled and constrained estimates of @xmath52 s and the parameter @xmath76",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for the two aforementioned nuclei .",
    "the data of the @xmath52 predicted by gogny forces and rmf parametrizations are taken from refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively .    from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath52 follows a linear trend with the parameter @xmath76 ( the correlation parameter is r=0.985 in all the considered cases ) with high accuracy , in agreement with the suggestion of @xcite . consequently , and as it is claimed in @xcite , the density dependence of @xmath74 can be constrained by the @xmath52 measured in finite nuclei .",
    "the same correlation is also fulfilled by the nucleus @xmath59zr with @xmath76 evaluated at the same average density .",
    "this fact points out that the dependence on the mass number of the average density is actually rather weak for medium and heavy nuclei @xcite . from the lower panel of this figure",
    "we also see explicitly that considering globally mean field models of different nature , the linearity between @xmath52 and the square root of the incompressibility modulus at saturation @xcite is lost in some cases , in agreement with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite .    to investigate this aspect in more detail , we plot in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the bulk incompressibility of eq .",
    "( [ incomp ] ) as a function of the density . in the lower panel",
    "we show , magnified , the relevant region of the upper panel . for densities close to 0.72@xmath42 the density dependent incompressibility @xmath74 computed with skyrme and gogny forces and the rmf takes similar values around 40 mev .",
    "however , the bcpm functional predict relatively larger values of @xmath74 at this average density .",
    "the reason of that lies , probably , in the fact that @xmath74 grows more linearly with the density than the other considered models .",
    "as far as the slope of @xmath74 has a value consistent with @xmath52 , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the value of @xmath74 at 0.72 @xmath42 is larger than the value predicted by the other considered mean field models . from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] one derives two important conclusions .",
    "first , the crossing density actually disappears when one considers mean field models of different nature .",
    "what is actually relevant , is to compute the slope of @xmath74 at _ the average density_. the same happens in the analysis of the symmetry energy using different mean field models @xcite .",
    "second , the small differences of @xmath74 at the average density may explain why @xmath79 and @xmath52 are not always linearly correlated .",
    "this happens , e.g. , with the nl1 parametrization with @xmath80=211 mev , a value similar to the one of the skm@xmath78 force but predicting @xmath52 clearly smaller , or the case of bcpm discussed previously .    in what concerns the isgqr , we are well aware of the fact that a theory with @xmath81 , as is the case of the bcpm functional , underestimates the collective quadrupole excitation energy . in table [ t1 ] we display the scaled energies of the quadrupole excitation computed with bcpm for several nuclei together with the available experimental values @xcite .",
    "insofar as the focus with a ks - dft approach is on ground state properties , we may not worry about the failure in the estimate of the isgqr .",
    "in general , for the description of excitation energies , the ks - dft should be generalized to include non - localities .",
    "attempts in this direction exist in condensed matter",
    ". it may be worth to look into that in the future also in the nuclear context .",
    "in this work we further elaborated on the previously established kohn - sham dft functional , bcp @xcite , based on advanced microscopic nuclear and neutron matter calculations .",
    "the bcp contained by large 5 adjustable parameters , three for finite size , one for spin - orbit and one for bulk .",
    "we reduced this number by approximately a factor of two coming up with a ks - dft functional containing only three adjustable parameters without deteriorating the excellent results .",
    "one of these parameters , the strength of the spin - orbit force , has the usual value , the results being quite insensitive to its variation within a relatively large margin .",
    "we would like to call this a rather weak , i.e. almost predetermined parameter ( in addition it may be possible to extract it from the g - matrix @xcite ) .",
    "the other two parameters , on the contrary , are fixed within extremely tight margins of the order of 10@xmath82 .",
    "they concern the bulk energy per particle , e / a , on the one hand and the surface energy on the other hand . indeed in the polynomial fit to the microscopically determined eos ,",
    "a single fine tuning parameter had to be introduced in order to get a minimal rms value for nuclear masses as well as a drift free ( i.e. scatter around zero ) difference of theoretical and experimental binding energies as a function of mass number .",
    "this parameter turned out to pin down the binding energy to the value , e / a = 15.98 mev .",
    "we emphasize that the fourth digit is significant here .",
    "for the second parameter , we made the simplifying ansatz to introduce a finite range gaussian convoluting the two densities in the @xmath83 terms of nuclear and neutron matter fits , that is @xmath84 .",
    "the pre - factor is determined from the bulk , so that the only free parameter is the range @xmath34 which evidently is responsible for the surface energy .",
    "the minimization of the rms of masses ( see main text for details ) again is determined within the very narrow margin of 10@xmath82 and turned out to have the value @xmath85 fm . with this , a rms value for the masses of 1.58 mev for 579 nuclei and of 0.027 fm for the radii with 313 nuclei is obtained .",
    "those values are as good as , e.g. , the ones of the gogny d1s and d1 m forces for the same set of nuclei .",
    "this very encouraging result calls for some comments .",
    "it is , indeed , quite surprising but on the other hand very satisfying , that the two basic nuclear quantities , energy per particle of the bulk and surface energy essentially suffice to determine a ks - dft functional with excellent ground state properties of nuclei .",
    "we should point out that the ks - dft approach is tailored for the ground state and that a time dependent extension is not evident .",
    "we nevertheless tried to determine at least the gmr energies with the sum rule technique and found that the results are in the same ball park as the ones of other skyrme , relativistic , or gogny type approaches . on the other hand",
    "the energies of the gqr seem to be underestimated systematically by about 1 mev .",
    "this is not so surprising , since a particularity of the ks - dft approach is that the bare mass is used while it is known that the gqr is sensitive to the value of the effective mass .",
    "future developments concern eventually the introduction of an effective density dependent mass @xmath86 .",
    "whether this is possible with results as satisfying as here , remains to be seen . a further point which needs to be improved",
    "is pairing . at the moment",
    "we treat it at a rather elementary level with a zero range force and cut off",
    ". a finite range force of the gogny type in the pairing channel would certainly be preferable .",
    "promising developments in this direction have recently been published @xcite . at the end",
    "let us mention that our theory fulfills all the eleven criteria put forward in @xcite besides one .",
    "our functional does not agree with the constraint concerning the value of the volume isospin incompressibility coefficient that appears in the leptodermous expansion of the finite nucleus incompressibility @xcite .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath87 the bcpm functional predicts @xmath88=-195.2 mev which is outside of the range proposed in @xcite , -760 @xmath89 -372 mev .",
    "however , two comments are in order .",
    "first the extraction of this coefficient from the experimental excitation energies of the gmr in finite nuclei @xcite is not a simple task at all and may give erroneous estimates of the coefficients of the leptodermous expansion of the finite nucleus incompressibility as it has been discussed in the past ( see for example refs .",
    "second , there are other estimates of the @xmath88 coefficients available in the literature , as for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , that predict -370 @xmath90 120 mev which embraces the prediction of the bcpm functional .",
    "in general , the criteria and their limitations in @xcite can certainly be subjected to debate .",
    "for example there is no reason to exclude functionals with @xmath35 as we have demonstrated in this work .",
    "the fact that our results comply with the criteria of @xcite is an indication that nuclear density functionals should be based as much as possible on a solid microscopic input . in this respect",
    "it is to be noted that out of the five functionals which survived the criteria in @xcite , three are also based on a microscopic input .",
    "we are grateful to p. danielewicz for useful discussions .",
    "we would like to thank n. schunck for a careful reading of the manuscript and many useful suggestions .",

    "in the sum rule approach it is enough to know few low energy weighted moments of @xmath91 ( the so - called sum rules ) to estimate the excitation energies of the giant resonances .",

    "however , if the moments are computed within the 1p1h rpa , it is possible to replace the exact ground - state wavefunction by the uncorrelated hf one to obtain the sum rules ( [ eq06 ] ) and ( [ eq07 ] ) @xcite . in spite of all these simplifications ,",
    "the calculation of the sum rules is only easy to handle in few particular cases , namely the isgmr and isgqr ones . in these cases the sum rules needed to estimate",

    "the direct evaluation of the commutators entering in eq . ( [ eq07 ] ) to compute the @xmath57 sum rule is a rather cumbersome task , that in the case of the monopole and quadrupole oscillations can be avoided with the help the so - called scaling method @xcite .",
