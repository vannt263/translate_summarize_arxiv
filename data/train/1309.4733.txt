    "in recent years , infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy has become an important tool for stellar astronomy , as demonstrated by results from the spitzer and wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) space telescopes , the cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ( crires ) at the very large telescope , and the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) spectrometer at the siding spring observatory , to name but a few .",
    "this research has been made possible by the continual development of better ir detectors for both ground - based and satellite - borne spectrometers ; a trend set to continue in the coming decade with the european space agency s ( esa ) gaia mission , and planned spectrometers for the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) facility .",
    "however , during these studies it has become clear that the analysis of expensively acquired astrophysical spectra is often not limited by the capabilities of the spectrometers themselves , but by the lack of accurate reference data in the atomic line database ( see @xcite and @xcite , for example ) .",
    "one project presently being affected in this way is the apache point galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) - part of the third sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) @xcite .",
    "apogee is using a highly - multiplexed near - ir spectrometer @xcite , capable of acquiring spectra in the h - band ( between @xmath2 m and @xmath3 m ) from up to 300 stars simultaneously with a spectral resolving power of the order of 30,000 . at these wavelengths",
    "galactic dust absorption is more than 5 times lower than in the optical ( e.g. @xmath4 ) , allowing stars in the galactic bulge and disc to be probed in addition to other stellar populations . during the planned three years of bright time",
    "a homogenous data set of 100,000 stars will be obtained , providing an integrated picture of the chemical and kinematical evolution of the galaxy @xcite .    among the stellar properties being derived from these spectra",
    "are the abundances of 15 elements , including fe peak elements , which will be measured to a precision of 0.1 dex ( the unit dex stands for decimal exponent .",
    "@xmath5 dex @xmath6 ) .",
    "a key requirement for such measurements is the availability of accurate oscillator strengths , f ( usually used as the @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the statistical weight of the lower level ) , for strong enough , well - resolved lines seen within the h - band .",
    "however , in the important case of neutral iron ( fe i ) , the recent critical compilation of @xmath7s by @xcite listed only the 51 transitions of @xcite with wavelength greater than 1 @xmath9 m ; grading them c to d+ , indicating uncertainties in @xmath7 of 25% to 50% .",
    "this inadequacy is at least in part due to the difficulty in measuring @xmath7s in the infrared .",
    "typically , oscillator strengths are obtained in the laboratory from measurements of atomic transition probabilities , a @xcite .",
    "@xmath10~,\\ ] ]    where the subscript @xmath11 denotes a target upper energy level , and @xmath12 , a transition from this level to a lower state , @xmath13 , that results in emission of photons of wavelength @xmath14 ( nm ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the statistical weight of the upper level .",
    "the @xmath16 values are found by combining experimental branching fractions , @xmath17 , with radiative lifetimes , @xmath18 @xcite . @xmath19",
    "the @xmath17 are commonly obtained from the ratio of calibrated emission line intensities , measured , for example , with fourier transform spectrometery @xcite .",
    "this was the technique adopted in this study , and is described in more detail in section [ section : bf ] .",
    "however , for reliable line intensity calibration , all emission lines from an upper level must be sufficiently closely spaced in wavenumber to either be observed in a single spectrum , or be seen in a number of overlapping spectra where at least one line from the target upper level is present in the overlap region to carry the intensity calibration from one spectrum to the next .",
    "@xmath18 is usually measured with time - resolved laser induced fluorescence ( lif ) . in a typical lif experiment , such as",
    "that reported by @xcite and @xcite , an atomic beam of the target material is generated by a hollow - cathode discharge lamp ( hcl ) , and is then excited by a light pulse from a pumped dye laser , the frequency of which is tunable in the visible to uv range . for a target upper level to be populated by this pulse , a strong transition must exist between it and an already populated lower level , where the energy difference matches that of the laser light .",
    "however , when studying infrared transitions , the requirements for each of these two experiments often become mutually exclusive .",
    "bfs can be obtained for transitions from upper levels that only produce closely - spaced infrared lines , but since these levels are relatively highly excited , they are not easily populated in a lif experiment .",
    "conversely , lif measurements can be performed on upper levels that include at least one transition to a populated low - lying state , but since such a transition would usually be seen in the ultraviolet , a large gap would be present between it and any infrared lines , preventing emission spectra acquired in the two regions from being placed on a common intensity scale .    in identifying the fe i transitions that will be required for the analysis of apogee spectra",
    ", we have found that the former situation typically prevails .",
    "we have therefore measured bfs in the normal way @xcite , as described in section [ section : bf ] , but have been forced to seek alternative means of normalising them to obtain the required transition probabilities from equation [ eqn : trprob ] .    in section [ section :",
    "lifetimes ] , we describe a method for obtaining ` effective lifetimes ' for target upper levels by refining the semi - empirical lifetimes of @xcite .",
    "transition probabilities obtained with reference to these effective lifetimes are then examined further in section [ section : bowtie ] , where we employ the long - established ladenburg technique to obtain _ relative _ @xmath7s from networks of interconnected transitions without prior knowledge of the associated upper level lifetimes @xcite .",
    "results obtained from each of these two methods are then presented in section [ section : results ] , where we also provide recommended @xmath7 values for the most critical fe i transitions needed for the apogee project .",
    "further transitions of interest to apogee ( and complementary projects , such as gaia - eso ) will be published in the near future .",
    "the branching fraction of a given transition from upper level , @xmath11 , is the ratio of its @xmath16 to the sum of all @xmath16 associated with @xmath11 . given an intensity calibrated line spectrum , this is equivalent to the ratio of observed relative line intensities for these transitions .",
    "@xmath20    this approach does not depend on any form of equilibrium in the population distribution over different levels , but it is essential that all significant transitions from @xmath11 be included in the sum over @xmath13 .",
    "the bfs reported here were obtained from fe  i atomic emission line spectra measured between @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath22 ( between @xmath24 nm and @xmath25 nm ) on the 2 m fourier transform ( ft ) spectrometer at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was excited from a 99.8% pure fe cathode mounted in a water cooled hcl running under the conditions shown in table [ table : spectra ] .",
    "all the results reported in section [ section : results ] were obtained from spectrum a , with spectra b and c being used to check the target lines were free from self - absorption or blends with carrier gas lines .",
    "the intensity of each spectrum was calibrated using a tungsten ( w ) halogen lamp with spectral radiance known to @xmath261.1% between @xmath27 nm and @xmath28 nm .",
    "spectra of this lamp were recorded both before and after the acquisition of each fe spectrum using the same spectrometer parameters , and the measured intensity used to obtain the spectrometer response function .",
    "the full procedure is discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the number of fe scans taken between each w lamp spectrum was limited to ensure all three spectra ( w , fe , w ) could be acquired within approximately 2 hours . over this period ,",
    "negligible variation in spectrometer response was observed .",
    "the two w lamp spectra were thus co - added , and the resulting spectrum used to obtain the spectrometer response function , from which the fe spectrum was intensity calibrated .    where additional fe scans were required to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of target transitions , multiple sets of w , fe , w spectra were obtained , and each of the calibrated fe spectra co - added to produce a single composite spectrum .",

    "the emission lines of these transitions were then identified in our fe spectra , and the ` xgremlin ` package @xcite used to obtain relative line intensities by fitting voigt profiles to them .",
    "some lines , predicted by kurucz to contribute less than 1 % to the total bf , were too weak to be observed .",
    "the sum total of their predicted branching fractions was thus assigned to an unobserved ` residual ' .",
    "this was then included in the summation over @xmath13 in equation [ eqn : bf ] to normalise the sum of all bfs to unity .",
    "bfs and @xmath7s were obtained with the aid of the ` fast ` package @xcite .        in some cases",
    ", there was disagreement between the predicted intensity of a line and that observed experimentally . where lines were predicted to be visible above our experimental noise limit , but were absent in our spectra , we assigned a maximum possible bf to each unobserved line based on the noise at its expected wavenumber .",
    "these disagreements were associated with transitions from @xmath29 upper levels , and would likely be due to a high degree of level mixing , lowering the accuracy of predicted line intensities .",
    "several sources of uncertainty contributed to the overall uncertainty in intensity of a given line :    1 .   the uncertainty in intensity of the line profile , obtained from the inverse of its signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "2 .   the uncertainty in intensity of the tungsten standard lamp when measured on the ft spectrometer , obtained from the inverse of its s / n at the same wavenumber as the line . 3 .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibrated spectral radiance of the tungsten lamp at the same wavenumber as the line . within one spectrum",
    "we ascribe @xmath30 of the quoted one standard deviation lamp calibration error , @xmath31 , to each line so that the uncertainty in the intensity ratio of any two lines is @xmath31 .",
    "these are added in quadrature to give an overall uncertainty in the calibrated intensity of a given line profile , @xmath32 .",

    "the uncertainty in the transition probability of a given line , @xmath37 , is then @xmath38    where @xmath39 is in the uncertainty in upper level lifetime .",
    "this then leads to the uncertainty in @xmath7 of a given line , @xmath40 - \\log[g_lf]~,\\ ] ]      upper level radiative lifetimes are typically obtained from lif measurements , as described in section [ section : intro ] .",
    "however , this technique can not be applied to the levels studied here , forcing us to adopt a different approach .",
    "table [ table : lifetimes ] lists the upper levels from which we wish to find the @xmath7s of transitions to lower levels .",
    "the theory column shows the upper level lifetimes calculated by @xcite .",
    "these were combined with our experimental bfs to arrive at an initial estimate to the @xmath7 of each transition listed in table [ table : linefit ] .",
    "these @xmath7s were then used in conjunction with a 1d model atmosphere interpolated from the calculations by @xcite for the atmospheric parameters of the sun ( @xmath41 k , log(gravity in cm s@xmath42 ) = 4.437 ) to generate synthetic fe i spectral lines , which were then compared with the solar spectrum from the atlas by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this solar atlas was obtained with the fourier transform spectrograph formerly at the pierce - mcmath facility at kitt peak national observatory , with a resolving power @xmath43 .",
    "the spectral synthesis calculations were performed with the ass@xmath31 t code @xcite .",
    "we would have liked to have obtained an optimized solar iron abundance from fits to fe i h - band lines with known , accurate @xmath44s .",
    "however , as already stated in the motivation for this study , such data are not available . in their absence , we adopted the solar abundance of @xmath45 dex from @xcite .",
    "although this value was obtained by those authors through the use of a 3d stellar atmosphere code , 3d effects on fe i lines in the sun are known to be small @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other recent solar studies using 1d model atmospheres , have produced fe abundances in agreement with this value @xcite .",
    "we made use of the most complete line list available to us , including both atomic and molecular transitions ( m. shetrone , private communication ) , which facilitates the analysis of fe i lines in the vicinity of other transitions .",
    "radiative and stark damping constants were adopted from kuruczs website while van der waals ( vdw ) while damping constants ( collisional damping due to neutral atoms ) were taken from @xcite when available ( calculated from the tables by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and slightly adjusted to match the solar spectrum @xcite . a micro - turbulence of 1.1 km s@xmath46 was included in the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "each model spectrum was convolved with a gaussian with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 2.3 km s@xmath46 to account for the instrumental profile ( fwhm @xmath47 1 km s@xmath46 ) and , most importantly , macro - turbulence .",
    "the adopted macro - turbulence is smaller than the values typically found in the optical ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such difference is likely related to the fe i infrared lines forming in a different range of atmospheric layers than fe i optical lines due to the lower continuum opacity in the h band .",
    "wavelength offsets were removed ( since it was line intensities that were of interest ) , and the background continuum level adjusted when necessary .",
    "the intensity of each model line , i@xmath48 , was then compared to the corresponding line intensity observed , i@xmath49 , and our initial @xmath7 varied until the two were matched .",
    "this provided a @xmath7 correction factor , @xmath50 , for each line .",
    "figure [ fig : linefit ] shows two examples of the fitted line profiles .",
    "our refined synthetic profile is plotted as a dashed black line and the observed solar profile as a solid black line .",
    "the remaining solid and dashed grey plots show the change in i@xmath48 for successive @xmath51 offsets to our initial @xmath7 .",
    "the cross - hatched grey area around each line shows the region used to compare the model and observed spectra .",
    "its width was chosen to avoid neighbouring lines , and its height restricted to relative fluxes between 0.7 and 1.0 to limit the influence of possible non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects .",
    "nlte effects tend to be most important in the outermost , low - density atmospheric layers , and therefore affect most significantly the cores of strong lines .",
    "the inset in each plot shows the sum of differences in relative flux , @xmath52 , as a function of @xmath50 , where the dashed vertical line indicates the optimal value of @xmath50 , obtained from the minimum of a parabolic fit to the differences at each @xmath50 .",
    "table [ table : linefit ] lists all the lines for which refined @xmath7s were determined . if it is assumed that each @xmath50 is due to an error in the corresponding kurucz upper level lifetime , rather than any other source , it can be directly related to a correction in @xmath18 . by adding each @xmath53 @xmath7 to its initial experimental @xmath7 and determining the corresponding value of a@xmath54 , equation [ eqn : trprob ]",
    "can be inverted to obtain an improved estimate of the upper level lifetime , as listed in table [ table : linefit ] . averaging these values over all lines belonging to a given upper level",
    "then provides a refined value of @xmath18 for that level , as listed in table [ table : lifetimes ] in the  effective lifetime \" column .",
    "these were then combined with our experimentally measured bfs to provide refined @xmath7s for all lines from each target upper level , as described in section [ section : results ] and listed in ",
    "bf & effective @xmath55 \" column in table [ table : results ] .    the uncertainties in the individual lifetimes shown in table [",
    "table : linefit ] were estimated by combining the uncertainty in bf ( and thus intensity ) for the line , the uncertainty in determining @xmath50 , and the standard deviation of refined lifetimes for all lines belonging to the same upper level .",
    "when these were combined to provide the uncertainties in effective lifetimes listed in table [ table : lifetimes ] , an additional uncertainty of 12% was included to account for the @xmath56 dex uncertainty in solar fe abundance quoted by @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty in solar fe abundance significantly increased the overall uncertainty in the effective lifetimes . yet",
    "nonetheless , the refinement procedure reduced the probable error in each lifetime from approximately 20% or more , found by taking the median difference between the @xcite lifetimes and experimental values for the levels studied in @xcite and @xcite , to between 12% and 15% .",

    "one technique that holds promise in this respect would be the coupling of an ir laser frequency comb with time domain ft spectroscopy measurements .",
    "however , in spite of this limitation , we have employed the ladenburg technique of determining relative @xmath7s for networks of related transitions to demonstrate that the @xmath7s reported here are consistent relative to one another , and  assuming the reported @xmath7s for the @xmath158 to @xmath140 and @xmath94_7 $ ] to @xmath210 transitions are correct  are accurate on an absolute scale . if necessary , the uncertainties in the ladenburg @xmath7s may be reduced in the future by replacing the solar line intensities shown in tables [ table : bowtie_n7d ] and [ table : bowtie_4f ] with laboratory - measured absorption intensities @xcite .",
    "this would eliminate , for example , non - lte , convective , and magnto hydrodynamic effects that arise from the complex nature of the solar photosphere .",
    "the results presented here represent the first part of an effort to provide the community with laboratory data for transition metal elements in the infra - red ; particularly in the regions of importance to surveys such as apogee and gaia - eso , space - borne missions such as esa s upcoming gaia satellite , and to support future research at facilities such as e - elt .",
