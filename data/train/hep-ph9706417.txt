    "theoretical description of hadronic amplitudes of the quark currents is one of the key problems of particle physics as such amplitudes provide a bridge between qcd formulated in the language of quarks and gluons and observable phenomena which deal with hadrons . in particular , the knowledge of such amplitudes",
    "is necessary for extraction of the parameters of the quark  mixing matrix in the standard model from the experiments on weak heavy hadron decays .",
    "the difficulty in such calculations lie in the fact that hadron formation occurs at large distances where perturbative qcd methods are not applicable and nonperturbative consideration is necessary .    various theoretical frameworks more or less directly related to qcd have been applied to the description of meson transition form factors : among them constituent quark models @xcite , lattice qcd simulations @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , analytical constraints @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd simulations is the most direct qcd based nonperturbative approach and thus should in principle provide most reliable results .",
    "however it faces serious technical problems with placing heavy particles on the lattice and performing calculations with inclusion of quark loops .",
    "so far direct calculations with @xmath0-quark are not possible and extrapolation in the quark mass is used which considerably reduces the predictive power of the method .",
    "various versions of qcd sum rules to meson decays give very uncertain predictions strongly dependent on the technical subtleties of the particular version .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite disregards the three  point qcd sum rules in favor of the light ",
    "cone sun rules which however involve more phenomenological inputs .",
    "constituent quark models have proved to be a fruitful phenomenological method for the description of heavy meson transition form factors .",
    "constituent quark models employ the fact that heavy meson consists of a heavy quark and light degrees of freedom with have quantum numbers of the quark state and assume that these light states can be approximately described by an effective constituent quark .",
    "the application of the various versions of the constituent quark picture to the decay processes has a long history .",
    "the first models were based on a semirelativistic @xcite or nonrelativistic @xcite considerations and did nt treat the quark spins thoroughly .",
    "further developments demonstrated the relativistic description of the quark spins to be important for consistent applications to meson decays .",
    "the exact solution to a complicated dynamical problem of treating the spins of the interacting particles is not known , but a simplified self  consistent relativistic consideration of the quark spins can be performed within the light  cone quark model ( lcqm ) @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with the application of this approach to the decay processes lies in the fact that the applicability of the model is restricted by the condition @xmath1 , while the physical region for hadron decays is @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the initial and final hadron masses , respectively .",
    "the problem is connected with the contribution of the so ",
    "called pair  creation subprocesses which can not be taken into account thoroughly in the model , except for a trivial case of a pointlike interaction . at spacelike momentum",
    "transfers the contribution of these subprocesses can be killed by choosing an appropriate reference frame , whereas at timelike momentum transfers such a frame does not exist and thus pair creation contributes together with the partonic contribution .",
    "an estimate of the form factors at timelike momentum transfers within the lcqm has been done in @xcite where the transition form factors have been calculated in the spacelike region and then numerically extrapolated to the timelike region assuming some particular @xmath4behavior .",
    "this works well if the accessible momentum transfer interval is not large .",
    "however , in the heavy  to  light meson decays this interval is of order of the heavy meson mass squared and the extrapolation procedure yields large uncertainties .",
    "the approach of refs @xcite calculates the partonic contribution to the form factors at timelike momentum transfers and thus avoids extrapolations .",
    "however , the nonpartonic contribution is omitted .",
    "such treatment can be justified if the latter is small that is not obvious @xmath5 .",
    "thus , one can see that for a reliable description of the decay processes within the lcqm it might be reasonable to find another formulation of the model appropriate also at timelike momentum transfers .",
    "such a formulation has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the approach of @xcite is based on the dispersion formulation of the lcqm .",
    "namely , the transition form factors obtained within the light ",
    "cone formalism at @xmath6 @xcite , are represented as dispersion integrals over initial and final hadron masses through their light  cone wave functions .",
    "the spectral densities of these representations can be calculated from the feynman graphs .",
    "the transition form factors at @xmath7 are derived by performing the analytical continuation in @xmath4 from the region @xmath1 . as a result , for a decay caused by the weak transition of the quark @xmath8 , form factors in the region @xmath9 are expressed through the light  cone wave functions of the initial and final hadrons and can be calculated in the decay region avoiding dangerous extrapolations .",
    "at the same time , such a dispersion formulation of the lcqm allows also a bit different view on the problem of constructing the form factors within the quark model : actually , we calculate the double spectral densities from the feynman graphs and thus obtain unsubtracted spectral representations .",
    "on the other hand we know that in general subtractions might be added to such representations and we need some additional arguments to decide on the necessity and the structure of the subtraction terms .",
    "let us notice that once we are working within an approach not directly deduced from qcd it is important to preserve essential features of the underlying fundamental theory in the model .",
    "thus matching the results obtained within the quark model to rigorous qcd results might be helpful for bringing more realistic features to the model .",
    "we use such matching to qcd results for determining the subtraction terms in the double spectral representations of the form factors .",
    "there are few qcd predictions on meson form factors in the decay region .",
    "fortunately , there is an important case in which qcd provides rigorous and model  independent results on transition form factors : namely , meson decays induced by transitions between heavy quarks . in this case the heavy ",
    "quark symmetry simplifies all the form factors in the leading @xmath10 order to the universal isgur ",
    "wise function @xcite .",
    "a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass can be constructed within the heavy quark effective theory @xcite based on qcd with the heavy quarks .",
    "although the form factors appearing in different @xmath10 orders can not be determined within the hqet , the latter restricts the structure of the expansion and the number of these universal form factors in each @xmath10 order and provides constraints on some of them at zero recoil .",

    "quark expansion of hqet has been employed in the isgw2 model @xcite .",
    "however the isgw2 model does not calculate the form factors within a relativistic dynamical approach on the basis of considering the meson structure but rather gives prescription for constructing the form factors .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite also employs matching to the heavy ",
    "quark expansion and obtains interesting results within the constutuent quark picture assuming a strong peaking of the momentum distribution of the constituent quarks inside a meson and avoiding details of the dynamics of the process .",
    "this model imposes constraints on the form factors but does not allow one to calculate them .",
    "the idea implemented in this work is to perform the heavy ",
    "quark expansion in the dispersion formulation of the quark model and to match this expansion to the hqet .",
    "this matching is used for determining the structure of the subtraction terms in the spectral representations .",
    "we consider the form factors of pseudoscalar meson transitions into pseudoscalar and vector final mesons through the vector , axial  vector , and currents and analyze the expansion in the leading and next  to  leading order .",
    "further constraints on the subtraction terms are obtained by considering the case of the heavy  to  light quark transition and analyzing the relations between the form factors of the tensor , vector and axial  vector currents .",
    "comparing the relations obtained within the dispersion quark model to the general relations found by isgur and wise @xcite allows us to fix the subtraction terms .",
    "our main results are the following : + 1 . applying the approach of @xcite to heavy meson transition",
    "throught the tensor current , we derive the decomposition of the form factors @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( the definitions are given in the next section ) in the next  to  leading order in @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we have found that the @xmath10 corrections to the form factor @xmath11 at zero recoil vanish just as for the form factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( the luke theorem ) .",
    "although the heavy meson transitions through the tensor current do not correspond to a real experimental situation we need the expansion for such form factors as a bench mark for comparison of the quark model .",

    "the unsubtracted double spectral densities are calculated from the feynman graphs and the subtraction terms in the spectral representations are determined by matching the @xmath10 expansion in the quark model to the hqet .",
    "we perform the heavy ",
