    "the atmosphere and ocean around the earth are rotating geophysical fluids , which are also two important components of the climate system .",
    "the phenomena of the atmosphere and ocean are extremely rich in their organization and complexity , involving a broad range of temporal and spatial scales . according to j. von neumann @xcite",
    ", the motion of the atmosphere can be divided into three categories depending on the time scale of the prediction .",
    "they are motions corresponding respectively to the short time , medium range and long term behavior of the atmosphere .",
    "one of the primary goals in climate dynamics is to document , through careful theoretical and numerical studies , the presence of climate low frequency variability , to verify the robustness of this variability s characteristics to changes in model parameters , and to help explain its physical mechanisms .",
    "the thorough understanding of this variability is a challenging problem with important practical implications for geophysical efforts to quantify predictability , analyze error growth in dynamical models , and develop efficient forecast methods .",
    "one typical source of the inter - annual climate low frequency variability is el nio - southern oscillation ( enso ) , which is associated with the walker circulation of the atmosphere over the tropics .",
    "the main objective of this article is to introduce a mathematical theory of the general circulation of the atmosphere over the tropics .",
    "the modeling part of the study is based on two important ingredients .",
    "first , from the general circulation point of view , there are three invariant regions of the atmosphere : the northern hemisphere , the southern hemisphere and the region over the tropics corresponding to zero latitude .",
    "the second is the new scaling law introduced recently by the authors , leading to correct circulation length scales .    the model",
    "is then analyzed using the dynamic transition theory and the geometric theory of incompressible flows , both developed recently by the authors .",
    "we refer the interested readers to @xcite and the references therein for the geometric theory , and to the appendix , @xcite and the references therein for the dynamic transition theory .",
    "we mention in particular here that the main philosophy of the dynamic transition theory is to search for the full set of transition states , giving a complete characterization on stability and transition .",
    "this complete set of transition states represent the *  physical reality \" * after the transition , and are described by a local attractor , rather than some steady states or periodic solutions or other type of orbits as part of this local attractor . with this theory ,",
    "many longstanding phase transition problems are either solved or become more accessible leading to a number of physical predictions .",
    "for example , the study of phase transitions of helium-3 leads not only to a theoretical understanding of the phase transitions to superfluidity observed by experiments , but also to such physical predictions as the existence of a new superfluid phase c for liquid helium-3 @xcite .",
    "the main results obtained in this article , on the one hand , verifies the general circulation patterns over the tropics associated with the walker circulation , and , on the other hand , lead to a new mechanism of el nio southern oscillation ( enso ) , which will be published in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "this new mechanism of the enso amounts to saying that enso , as a self - organizing and self - excitation system , with two highly coupled processes .",
    "the first is the oscillation between the two metastable warm ( el nio phase ) and cold events ( la nia phase ) , and the second is the spatiotemporal oscillation of the sea surface temperature ( sst ) field .",
    "the interplay between these two processes gives rises the climate variability associated with the enso , leads to both the random and deterministic features of the enso , and defines a new natural feedback mechanism , which drives the sporadic oscillation of the enso .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the atmospheric circulation model over the tropics , which is analyzed in sections 3 and 4 , with concluding remarks given in section 5 .",
    "physical laws governing the motion and states of the atmosphere and ocean can be described by the general equations of hydrodynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the atmospheric motion equations over the tropics are the boussinesq equations restricted on @xmath0 , where the meridional velocity component @xmath1 is set to zero , and the effect of the turbulent friction is taking into considering using the scaling law derived in @xcite : @xmath2 here @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) represent the turbulent friction , @xmath5 is the radius of the earth , the space domain is taken as @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the one - dimensional circle with radius @xmath5 , and @xmath8    for simplicity , we denote @xmath9 in atmospheric physics , the temperature @xmath10 at the tropopause @xmath11 is a constant .",

    "in an idealized case , the temperature deviation @xmath27 vanishes . in this case , the study of transition of ( [ 10.39 ] ) is of special importance to understand the longitudinal circulation . here , we are devoted to discuss the dynamic bifurcation of ( [ 10.39 ] ) , the walker cell structure of bifurcated solutions , and the convection scale under the idealized boundary condition @xmath28    for the problem ( [ 10.39 ] ) with ( [ 10.41 ] ) and ( [ 10.44 ] ) , let @xmath29 then , define the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the leray projection , and @xmath35 @xmath36 . under the definitions ( [ 10.46 ] ) , the problem ( [ 10.39 ] ) with one of ( [ 10.41 ] ) and ( [ 10.44 ] ) is equivalent to the following abstract equation @xmath37    consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath38 which is equivalent to @xmath39 with the boundary conditions ( [ 10.41 ] ) and ( [ 10.44 ] ) .",
