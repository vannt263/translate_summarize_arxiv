    "in the last years the interest in charmonia has been renewed by the experimental observation of new charmonium - like states  @xcite .",
    "some of these states have been easily identified as charmonia , e.g. @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath5  @xcite , as reported by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite . however there",
    "exist other important resonances that are still under examination .",
    "these states , denoted as @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , do not match the predictions of the nonrelativistic or semirelativistic @xmath0 potential models and have been described as tetraquarks , molecules , glueballs and hybrids  @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation suggests that some of these states may be the result of kinematic effects  @xcite that appear in the nearby of the thresholds of the open charm channels .",
    "however , this point is a controversial issue  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these resonances depends , to a certain extent , on the theoretical approach that is followed to perform the amplitude analysis of the data  @xcite and to study charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) must be considered , in any case , the underlying field theory for the study of these systems . however , due to the difficulty of finding analytically ( approximated ) solutions for qcd , alternative approaches have been followed .",
    "for example , numerical lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite , potential quark models  @xcite , unquenched quark models ( uqm )  @xcite , and bethe - salpeter approaches  @xcite .",
    "lqcd represents a very promising but , at the same time , highly difficult tool . in particular",
    ", it is computationally taxing and still needs to be improved in order to reproduce accurately the hadron spectrum  @xcite .",
    "hence , more phenomenological models have been developed . in more detail ,",
    "the construction of potential quark models , inspired by qcd , has proved to be a very useful tool for the study of these physical systems .",
    "historically , the cornell potential  @xcite represents the first interaction that was introduced , with partial success , to study the charmonium spectrum .",
    "this model consists of a coulomb - like potential and a linear term inserted in a standard nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "the coulomb - like term takes into account reduction of the one gluon exchange ( oge ) in the short range region .",
    "the linear term introduces quark confinement in the model , in approximate agreement with the spectroscopy of the first excited states .",
    "lqcd studies have confirmed the presence of the linear term in the long range effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "however , in this model , the nonrelativistic approximation can not be really justified and the fine structure of the spectrum , related to the spin - spin , spin - orbit and tensor interactions , has to be introduced by hand in a purely phenomenological way . furthermore , higher order effects of the field theory reduction are also absent .    throughout the literature several",
    "_ relativized _ quark models have been introduced in order to incorporate some relativistic effects  @xcite .",
    "a possible approach to include some of the relativistic effects in a consistent way is given by the generalization of the fermi - breit expansion ( originally studied for the electromagnetic interaction ) followed in  @xcite to study the resonant states of strongly interacting quarks .",
    "we point out that this approach is not fully relativistic because the interaction terms are expanded in powers of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the quark momentum and mass , respectively .",
    "these models also assume that the mean values of @xmath9 are small and , consequently , only the first terms of the expansion are retained .",
    "the obtained effective interaction , by means of a fourier transform , can be expressed in the coordinate space in terms of local operators . as a consequence ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the effective hamiltonian of these models can be solved with the standard techniques . for the specific case of relativized quark models for hadronic systems ,",
    "the bakamjian - thomas construction may be used in the context of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to perform exact lorentz boosts on the wave functions of the model , but no connection between the interaction hamiltonian and the dirac structure of the underlying theory can be easily established .",
    "another approach to improve the dynamical description of the quarkonium spectrum consists in employing the uqm formalism . in the uqm",
    ", starting from a relativized quark model , the coupling of the valence quarks to the continuum is taken into account through a self energy term  @xcite .",
    "this coupling causes a shift in the energy , generally leading to a reduction in the masses of the quarkonia  @xcite in the high - lying states .",
    "this effect can also be incorporated , in a more phenomenological way , through the screening of the interaction potential  @xcite which produces a similar global result .",
    "it is also possible to perform a four - dimensional fully relativistic computation of the heavy meson spectra solving the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this approach has been taken in the context of the _ rainbow ladder _",
    "approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approach presents relevant theoretical advantages , however the quality of the theoretical spectrum is not completely satisfactory and , in particular , spurious states are obtained  @xcite as a consequence of the adopted dynamical approximations  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we develop a relativistic model inspired by the oge interaction . in our calculation",
    "we do not perform any nonrelativistic expansion . hence , the well - known spin - orbit , spin - spin and tensor effects are automatically given by the relativistic calculation .",
    "due to the dirac structure of the interaction , the model is necessarily constructed in the momentum space .",
    "we include vector and scalar interaction terms as well as phenomenological screening factors  @xcite .",
    "we solve an integral eigenvalue hamiltonian equation in the momentum space through a variational method and we perform the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in a selected orthonormal basis .",
    "we determine the parameters of the model by fitting the low - lying charmonia states taking into account the experimental uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties are exactly propagated to the parameters and to the computed spectrum using the bootstrap technique  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we develop the general structure of our theoretical model .",
    "in particular , we show the details of the vector and scalar interactions that we use to obtain the charmonium spectrum . in section  [ sec : determspectr ] we discuss the methods used to solve the eigenvalue equation and to determine the free parameters of the model and their uncertainties .",
    "we also show how these uncertainties are propagated to the energy levels of the theoretical charmonium spectrum . in section  [ sec : charm ]",
    "we provide our results compared to the available experimental data and we discuss different phenomenological interpretations .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the results of the study .",
    "the details on the spin - angle matrix elements are left for appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "in this section we provide a detailed description of our theoretical model for the study of charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "the model consists in a three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation in which only the contributions of the positive energy dirac spinors of the quarks are retained .",
    "dirac spinors guarantee that relativity is satisfied and the dirac structure of the interaction is highlighted . due to the relativistic nature of the model , the well known spin - orbit , spin - spin and tensor effects",
    "are all automatically included in our calculation .",
    "if we expand our model in powers of @xmath9 we recover the standard semirelativistic fermi - breit interaction  @xcite .      as it is customary , we work in the center of mass ( cm ) reference frame of the @xmath3 system and we use the system of natural units ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the quantities of the ket and bra states are labeled with the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "the matrix elements of the total hamiltonian in momentum space are obtained adding two terms that represent the vector and the scalar interactions @xmath37 where , for brevity , the spin matrices have not been explicitly written .",
    "however , the standard phenomenological potentials , do not allow for a good reproduction of the spectrum , in particular , above the open charm threshold  @xcite .",
    "a more complete dynamical treatment is necessary .",
    "some of the vacuum quantum effects predicted by qcd can be taken into account by _ unquenching _ the quark model as in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the virtual pair creation effects are incorporated to the hamiltonian , i.e , the contribution given by the coupling of the @xmath3 states to the meson - meson continuum  @xcite .",
    "below threshold , this coupling to the continuum states gives rise to virtual @xmath38 components in the meson wave function that shift the charmonia  @xcite and bottomonia  @xcite masses through a self - energy term .",
    "part of these virtual pair production effects can be taken into account , in a more phenomenological way , introducing a screening factor in the confinement interaction in the coordinate space  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce this screening effect phenomenologically , incorporating momentum dependent factors in the interaction hamiltonian as follows @xmath39 where the factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 take into account the screening effect . in the present work we use the following step - wise function to describe such screening effects @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 will be determined ( as the rest of the parameters of the model ) by fitting to the lowest energy levels of the charmonium spectrum .",

    "the @xmath147 state is obtained with higher values than the experimental data found by lhcb for both potentials .",
    "more precisely , potentials i and ii predict this state approximately @xmath171 and @xmath214 above the experimental value , respectively .",
    "this resonance was observed for the first time more than 20 years ago  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was observed again by belle collaboration  @xcite and confirmed by besiii collaboration  @xcite . in agreement with semirelativistic potential models",
    "@xcite , our model describes reasonably well this state with both potentials , @xmath216 versus an experimental value of @xmath217 , with the standard assignment @xmath218 . in  @xcite , it was found a mass value of @xmath219 , similar to ours . in the uqm",
    "@xcite a mass of @xmath220 was found .",

    "the last missing resonance , the @xmath222 state , also remains undetected despite that its energy value is close to the open charm threshold .",
    "we have studied the charmonium spectrum employing a @xmath3 relativistic dirac potential model in momentum space with a vector and a scalar interaction .",
    "positive energy dirac spinors have been used without performing any nonrelativistic expansion .    in our model , we have employed for the vector interaction a one gluon exchange term plus a confining term . for the latter term we used a standard",
    "regularized linear confining interaction transformed to momentum space . for the scalar interaction we have considered two possibilities : ( i )",
    "potential i , which is given by a constant term only , namely @xmath71 ; and ( ii ) potential ii , that together with the constant term @xmath71 it also incorporates a standard regularized linear confining term .",
    "we have also incorporated phenomenological screening factors that take into account the coupling of the @xmath3 system with virtual @xmath0 states .",
    "potential i depends on 7 parameters : the @xmath108 and @xmath109 quark mass @xmath11 , the zero point energy @xmath80 , the strong coupling constant @xmath64 , the strength of the confining term in the vector interaction @xmath66 , the constant term of the scalar interaction @xmath71 , and the parameters of the screening factors @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "potential ii depends on 8 parameters : the same ones as potential i plus the strength of the confining term of the scalar interaction @xmath72 .",
    "both potential models have been fitted to the experimental masses of 8 resonances below the open charm threshold ( see table  [ tab : table2 ] ) : @xmath119 , @xmath122 , @xmath124 , @xmath128 , @xmath126 , @xmath130 , @xmath225 and @xmath114 . in both cases",
    "we obtain a good description of these states , including the unusual splitting between @xmath126 , @xmath128 and @xmath130 resonances .",
    "the uncertainties in the parameters have been computed using bootstrap technique . in this way",
    "we can propagate exactly the statistical errors in the data to both the parameters and the resonance masses taking into account all the correlations .",
    "we predict the energies of the resonances above the open charm threshold and compute the associated uncertainties ( see tables  [ tab : table3 ] and [ tab : tabla4 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : espec1 ] and [ fig : espec2 ] ) .",
    "we predict correctly the structure of the charmonium spectrum and we obtain a reasonable agreement with most of the available experimental data .",
    "the screening effect turns out to be relevant in the description of the spectrum with both potentials , especially at energy values above the open charm threshold .",
    "the correlation matrices of the parameters for potential i ( table  [ correlation1 ] ) and ii ( table  [ correlation2 ] ) show that there is a small correlation between the screening parameters and the vector interaction parameters . however , the correlation is strong with the parameters of the scalar interaction .",
    "hence , we confirm that the screening factors in our model take phenomenologically ( and only partially ) into account the excitation of @xmath0 degrees of freedom . as the excitation energy grows , it becomes more difficult to reproduce the data , indicating that the presence of new degrees of freedom that should be introduced in the theoretical model .",
    "this point requires a new and more comprehensive investigation .    in more detail , the @xmath135 , @xmath2 and @xmath5",
    "are identified as @xmath226 states with @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5 is accurately reproduced .",
    "the @xmath2 mass is slightly overestimated ( @xmath227 with potential i and @xmath154 with potential ii ) signaling that this state is mostly a @xmath3 state with its mass dynamically modified by effects not taken into account in our models , e.g. molecular components or open channel effects .",
    "the @xmath135 is not well described , and , hence , the @xmath141 splitting among these states is not properly accounted for .",
    "we also recover the general structure of the @xmath174 states above the @xmath1 threshold , namely @xmath160 ( @xmath166 ) , @xmath161 ( @xmath167 ) , @xmath162 ( @xmath168 ) and @xmath163 ( @xmath175 with potential i and @xmath176 with potential ii ) .",
    "however , while @xmath160 and @xmath161 are sufficiently well described , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are not .",
    "our two models produce different results for the @xmath179 [ @xmath180 , @xmath181 [ @xmath182 and @xmath183 [ @xmath189 resonances .",
    "potential i produces a @xmath169 state that can roughly be identified with the @xmath179 resonance .",
    "the controversial higher - lying @xmath183 resonance is reproduced within the uncertainties of the model with potential ii but not with potential i , and the @xmath181 resonance is reproduced with both potentials , but within very large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we consider that we are not able to provide a good description of @xmath190 and @xmath191 resonances with our model , an indication that these states might be dominated by dynamical effects that go beyond the @xmath3 picture .",
    "the @xmath208 resonance is reproduced with potential i , suggesting an acceptable correspondence with a @xmath3 @xmath210 state ; however , it is not properly reproduced by potential ii despite the large uncertainties of the theoretical prediction .",
    "the @xmath215 state is also well reproduced , in agreement with semirelativistic potential models .    further investigation should be devoted to understand confinement in a more complete way .",
    "the inclusion of a confining term in both the vector and the scalar interactions provides , in general , slightly better results than just a confining term in the vector term .",
    "unfortunately , both terms become highly correlated .",
    "the inclusion of relativistic effects in @xmath0 potential models constitutes an important step forward in the description of charmonia , especially the higher - lying states .",
    "however , it is apparent that further dynamical effects such as molecular admixture , tetraquark components , as well as open channels and threshold effects have to be taken into account to obtain a complete description of the experimental states .",
