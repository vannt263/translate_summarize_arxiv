    "genetic information in living cells is carried in the double - helical linear sequence of nucleotides in dna .",
    "the dna double - helix can be found in several forms that differ from each other in the geometrical characteristics such as diameter and handedness . under normal physiological conditions",
    ", dna adopts the b - form , in which it consists of two helically twisted sugar - phosphate backbones with a diameter @xmath3 nm , which are stuffed with base pairs and are located asymmetrically with respect to each other as characterized by the presence of major and minor grooves .",
    "the helix is right - handed with @xmath4 base pairs per turn , and the pitch of the helix is @xmath5 nm @xcite .",
    "it is well known that above ph 1 each phosphate group in dna has a negative charge @xcite , which renders the polymer stiff due to the electrostatic repulsion between these groups .",
    "the presence of neutralizing counterions and salt in the solvent screens the electrostatic repulsion , thereby leading to an effective way of controlling the stiffness of polyelectrolytes via the ionic strength of the solution . to account for the electrostatic stiffening , odijk @xcite , and skolnick and fixman @xcite have adopted an effective wormlike chain description for the bending elasticity of stiff polyelectrolytes , and have calculated the correction to the persistence length due to the electrostatic interactions .",
    "the so - called electrostatic persistence length is found to be proportional to the square of the debye screening length , implying that the stiffness of polyelectrolytes such as dna should be very sensitive to salt concentration @xcite .",
    "while there are experiments that measure the electrostatic contribution to the bending rigidity of dna in various salt concentrations @xcite , it is generally believed that changing the ionic strength has no significant effect on the rigidity of dna under most physiologically relevant conditions @xcite .",
    "hence , in this so - called salt saturation limit , the bending rigidity of dna is entirely due to the mechanical stiffness of the double - helical backbone .",
    "= 2.0 cm    0.9truecm    similar studies have shown that the twist rigidity of dna is also relatively insensitive to the ionic strength of the solution @xcite .",
    "this experimental finding is usually explained by saying that ( unlike bending ) twisting a polyelectrolyte does not change the distance between the different charges on its backbone appreciably , and thus it is not affected by electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "here , we set out to revisit this line of argument and attempt to account for the above experimental observation from a different point of view .",
    "we consider the electrostatic self - interaction of the double - helical sugar - phosphate backbone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics ] ) and show that the periodic arrangement of the charge distribution effectively screens the electrostatic interaction with the screening length given by the pitch of the dna . in other words , corresponding to such a periodic charge distribution , there are two competing screening lengths : ( 1 ) the debye screening length of the bulk solution @xmath6 that is controlled by the ionic strength , and ( 2 ) the period of the charge distribution @xmath7 , and it is the smaller of these two lengths that controls the range of coulomb interaction .",
    "we find that electrostatic interactions make an appreciable contribution to the twist rigidity of dna , although it depends only weakly on the debye screening length as long as this length is larger than the dna pitch .",
    "we study the effect of various geometrical parameters such as the diameter of the double - helix , the distance between the two helices , and the pitch , as well as the debye screening length , on the electrostatic contribution to twist rigidity and show that it can be both positive and negative depending on the values of these parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , where a diagram is sketched in the parameter space delineating all the different regimes .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : model ] describes the model that is used to study the electrostatic contribution to twist rigidity of dna , followed by the presentation of the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , sec . [",
    "sec : discussion ] concludes the paper , while some details of the calculations appear in three appendices .",
    "to study the effect of electrostatic interactions on the twist rigidity of dna , we consider a simple model in which the sugar - phosphate charged backbone of each dna strand is assumed to wrap around a cylinder of radius @xmath8 in a helical manner , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics ] . the double - helix can then be viewed as a cylinder with a surface charge density @xmath9 corresponding to the negative charges , whose electrostatic self - energy can be calculated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 parameterizes the position on the surface of the cylinder with @xmath12 being the coordinate along the axis and @xmath13 being the polar angle .",
    "the effective pair potential between two charges in the solution is given by the debye - hckel interaction @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bjerrum length , and @xmath6 is the debye screening length , defined via @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the valence and the concentration of the salt species @xmath19 , respectively , and summation holds over the ionic species in the solution .    due to the helical structure of dna",
    ", @xmath9 is a doubly periodic function , namely , @xmath20 , where @xmath7 is the helix pitch .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to write @xmath9 in the fourier space as @xmath21 where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are integer numbers .",

    "( [ e - electro ] ) using the fourier representation of the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "after some manipulation , whose details can be found in appendix [ app : coulomb ] , one finds @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the spontaneous twist of the helix , and @xmath27 is the overall length of the macromolecule .",

    ", we can then read off the electrostatic twist rigidity as @xmath39 subject to the constraint that the relative positioning of the two helical strands should not alter upon deformation , and thus we should assume that the parameter @xmath30 changes accordingly to @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",

    "one observes that for the relatively large window of @xmath86 , @xmath81 is almost constant , and is thus not sensitive to the relative positioning of the two strands . for @xmath87 and @xmath88 ,",
    "a divergence sets in due to the fact that the charges on the two strands develop contacts with each other .",

    "[ fig : kappa ] as a function of @xmath77 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the dependence on the debye screening parameter in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) comes only from the first term , where the negative sign of the coefficient of @xmath91 causes a dip in the plot for @xmath81 around @xmath92 , which by chance corresponds to the normal physiological salt concentration .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] , the dependence of the electrostatic twist rigidity on @xmath77 is extremely weak as long as @xmath93 , which is a manifestation of the fact that screening is controlled by the periodic charge distribution and the effective screening length is set by the pitch @xmath7 that is shorter than @xmath6 in this regime .",
    "it is worth saying a few words about the other limit where @xmath94 , corresponding to high salt concentration . in eq .",
    "( [ efinal ] ) , one can manifestly see that in the @xmath23th term in the series there is a competition between @xmath57 and @xmath95 to control the screening .",
    "if the salt concentration is so high that we have @xmath96 , the periodic structure plays no role and screening is entirely controlled by the debye screening in the bulk . for relatively strong debye screening",
    "when @xmath97 , we can use the simple asymptotic forms of the bessel functions and find an asymptotic expression for the electrostatic twist rigidity as @xmath98 } { [ ( \\kappa a)^2+(n a \\omega_0)^2]^{5/2}}.\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{csalt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression can be used for the region @xmath94 , where it predicts @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for @xmath102 , for a value of @xmath103 .",
    "for a polyelectrolyte with a periodic spatial charge distribution , such as the double - helical structure of dna , there are two competing mechanisms for screening the electrostatic self - interaction and its contribution to twist rigidity , namely , the _ debye screening _ due to the free ions in the solution , and the _ structural screening _ caused by the periodic structure of the charge distribution .",
    "while the screening length for the former case is set by the debye length @xmath6 , it is set by the period @xmath7 of the charge distribution in the latter , and the dominant mechanism corresponds to the one with the shorter screening length .",
    "it appears that the contribution of electrostatic interactions to twist rigidity can be both negative and positive , depending on the parameters .",
    "the negative values for the electrostatic torsional stiffness could lead to instability in the structure of the helical polyelectrolyte , depending on whether the mechanical structure of the macromolecule can counter - balance the effect of the electrostatic instability .",
    "we have used this criterion in fig . [",
    "fig : diagram ] to summarize these different regimes in the parameter space . considering that a helical polyelectrolyte seems to be the general structure of many stiff biopolymers ( such as dna and actin ) it will be interesting to know which helical configurations can in principle lead to stable structures , and which ones can not .",
    "this could especially be important in the case of biopolymers that self - assemble through polymerization processes , such as actin , where such energetic considerations could hamper or favor the polymerization process .",
    "the twist rigidity of b - dna is believed to be roughly 75 nm @xcite , which should be thought of as the sum of the mechanical and the electrostatic contributions : @xmath104 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath105 nm reveals that about @xmath106 of the twist rigidity of dna is due to electrostatic interactions .",
    "this result is more or less independent of the salt concentration , as the dependence of @xmath81 to salt concentration is very weak .",
    "for example , the difference between @xmath81 at zero and very high salt concentration is about @xmath107 .",
    "therefore @xmath108 , which is very small .",
    "while this naturally explains why in the experiments no sensitivity on the salt concentration has been observed , it certainly does not mean that the electrostatic contribution to @xmath109 is negligible .    in the above analysis",
    "we have assumed that imposing a finite angle of twist between the two ends of a helical polyelectrolyte leads to a uniform twist .",
    "this is analogous to the assumption of a uniform bending made by odijk when calculating the electrostatic bending rigidity , and presumably holds true when the effective elasticity due to electrostatics is local . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this assumption has been scrutinized and it has been shown that this assumption is valid provided one of these conditions hold : ( 1 ) the polyelectrolyte segment is long , ( 2 ) the debye screening is strong , ( 3 ) the charging is weak , or ( 4 ) the mechanical stiffness of the polyelectrolyte is larger than the electrostatic contribution .",
    "we expect the same argument to hold true for the twist rigidity as well .",
    "since for the case of dna we have shown that the mechanical twist rigidity is much larger than the electrostatic contribution , we can safely assume that the twist is uniform .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the electrostatic contribution to twist rigidity of dna , taking into account its dependence on salt concentration in the solvent .",
    "we have shown that there is a non - negligible electrostatic contribution to twist rigidity , which varies very slowly by changing the salt concentration in the solution . by changing the geometrical parameters of the helix and the debye screening length , the electrostatic twist rigidity can change sign and become negative , implying that a helical structure could be a both stable as well as unstable configuration for a helical polyelectrolyte .",
