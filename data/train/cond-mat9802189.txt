    "interest in quantum spin chains as examples of low - dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems was greatly revived in 1983 by haldane s famous conjecture@xcite of a fundamental difference between half - integer and integer quantum spin chains , a phenomenon without equivalent in higher dimensional systems .    in the meantime ,",
    "haldane s conjecture has been firmly established , while not rigorously proven .",
    "the numerical values of the predicted gaps and finite correlation lengths for isotropic integer spin chains are by now extremely well known both in the @xmath3@xcite and the @xmath0@xcite cases , which constitute the extreme quantum limit .",
    "furthermore , for both cases haldane s predictions of a massive - relativistic dispersion relation have been confirmed@xcite .",
    "haldane s conjecture was derived from a non - linear quantum sigma model , which is an effective low - energy continuum theory of the isotropic heisenberg model in the semiclassical limit @xmath4 .",
    "it does not provide immediate insight in the ground state of integer spin chains .",
    "the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model@xcite provides a profound physical understanding of gapped spin liquids .",
    "the aklt model is the hamiltonian which gives rise to the following exact ground state : each spin of length @xmath8 is decomposed into @xmath9 completely symmetrized @xmath10 spins .",
    "pairs of such spins on neighboring sites are linked up by singlet bonds , giving rise to @xmath8 singlet bonds between sites . in the case of @xmath3 ,",
    "all important features of the isotropic heisenberg model and the aklt model , which has the hamiltonian @xmath11 are in qualitative agreement@xcite .",
    "a particularly striking feature of both models is the existence of a hidden non - local topological order , also known as string order@xcite , @xmath12 which does not vanish in the limit @xmath13 . for the aklt model ,",
    "the value is @xmath14 , for the heisenberg model @xmath15@xcite . in the case of a @xmath3 chain",
    ", it describes a hidden antiferromagnetic order of @xmath16 spin states , which is diluted by arbitrary numbers of interposed @xmath17 spin states and thus not seen in the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "the existence of the hidden order can further be associated with the breaking of a @xmath18 symmetry in the haldane phase@xcite , as well as with the existence of a four - fold degenerate ground state of an open heisenberg chain in the haldane phase@xcite . for @xmath3 , the success of the aklt - model",
    "can be understood as it is a quantum disorder point , a remnant of a classical phase transition@xcite . for higher spins , as we will see , both the existence of hidden order and its signification are not clear .    in this paper",
    ", we want to make progress towards understanding how the classical phase diagram emerges out of the substantially different @xmath3 phase diagram . examining different scenarios@xcite",
    ", we will see that their fundamental difference regards whether or not there exists hidden order in the @xmath0 phase diagram for suitable anisotropies .",
    "our results will allow to decide quite clearly in terms of a scenario without hidden order for @xmath0 .",
    "we finish by addressing briefly why the aklt model is not successful in explaining the anisotropic @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "in real physical systems , such as nenp as the quintessential @xmath3 spin chain@xcite , anisotropies are always present , in the case of nenp an easy - plane on - site anisotropy @xmath19@xcite . in order to link experiments to theory ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to understand the phase diagram with anisotropies . at the same time",
    ", this may provide deeper theoretical insight into the interplay of the different phases .    _",
    "@xmath3 phase diagram .",
    "_ the @xmath3 phase diagram , as the physically most relevant one with at the same time the strongest quantum effects for an integer spin chain , has been studied extensively and is by now extremely well understood@xcite .",
    "let us summarize the main features ( figure [ fig : s1diag ] ) .    both for substantially strong @xmath20 anisotropy and sufficiently small @xmath6 ,",
    "one finds ising - like ordered ( anti)ferromagnetic phases , depending on the sign of @xmath20 .",
    "the transition lines are not very far from those in the classical limit ( see below ) .",
    "all other phases are disordered , but otherwise physically quite distinct : for large @xmath6 , all @xmath21 states are suppressed and a singlet phase emerges , with a gap proportional to @xmath6 , as the gap is essentially the energy to excite one spin to @xmath22@xcite .",
    "below that , there are two phases .",
    "their separation line is strictly @xmath23 , as first shown by den nijs and rommelse@xcite , and later on confirmed numerically with increasing precision@xcite . for @xmath24 , there is a gapped quantum liquid , the haldane phase , including the isotropic heisenberg model , with the properties described above . for @xmath25",
    ", there is an xy - phase with power - law decay in the @xmath26 correlations .",
    "in fact , the xy phase decomposes into two phases with different correlation functions , linked by an ising - like transition@xcite .",
    "phase transitions out of fm order are first order , from afm order to the large-@xmath6 phase first order , from haldane to xy , and from xy to large-@xmath6 kosterlitz - thouless like , and the haldane to large-@xmath6 transition has been likened to a preroughening transition in rsos models@xcite .    _ classical phase diagram .",
    "_ on the other hand , the @xmath1 phase diagram in the semiclassical limit @xmath4 is very easily obtained ( figure [ fig : classical ] ) .",
    "the quantum spins of length @xmath8 are replaced by unit vector spins which do commute .",
    "this is in order as all terms in the hamiltonian are of the order @xmath27 , such that this factor can be scaled out .",
    "one finds three phases :    1 .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 : ordered antiferromagnetic ising - phase ( afm ) 2 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 : ordered ferromagnetic ising - phase ( fm ) 3 .",
    "@xmath32 : ordered antiferromagnetic xy phase ( xy ) : all spins in - plane",
    "how does this classical phase diagram emerge from the @xmath3 phase diagram ? in recent years , various scenarios have been proposed .    \\1 . bosonisation@xcite predicts for all integer spins @xmath8 essentially the same scenario as for @xmath3 ( figure [ fig : boson ] ) .",
    "bosonisation can be expected to predict the nature of the phases found and their topology ( i.e.  which phases are joined by a transition ) , but not to yield quantitative values for the phase boundaries .    for @xmath3 , bosonisation indeed predicts all phases and the correct topology of the phase diagram ; it merely misses that the large-@xmath6 , afm and fm phases meet respectively for very large anisotropies , beyond the limit of applicability of bosonisation . for higher spins",
    ", it is predicted in particular that for an isotropic exchange interaction @xmath33 there is exactly one transition from the haldane phase to the large-@xmath6 phase for @xmath34 . from other arguments@xcite",
    "it can be concluded that for large @xmath8 the large-@xmath6 phase will pushed out to @xmath34 , whereas the gap of the haldane phase vanishes ; in the @xmath4 limit the gapless xy - phase emerges ( but for the isotropic point , any @xmath35 will then favour in - plane spins for @xmath36 ) .",
    "numerical studies@xcite are by now in excellent agreement that already for the @xmath0 case there are not only two , but three phases when taking @xmath37 for positive @xmath6 and @xmath33 . while the results of ref .",
    "are not reconcileable with bosonisation , those of refs .   and could be interpreted as being in accordance with bosonization , if one allows for a major deformation of the bosonization phase diagram . in the scenario we are going to show numerically below",
    ", bosonisation will be found to predict the correct phases , but we will also see that the necessary deformation of the bosonisation phase diagram changes it almost beyond recognition .",
    "a second scenario was proposed by oshikawa@xcite in the spirit of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model ( figure [ fig : s2oshi ] ) .",
    "oshikawa@xcite has shown that the hidden topological order parameter ( the string order parameter ) disappears exactly in the aklt model , describing the isotropic chain , for all even integer spins @xmath38 , while it yields a finite value for odd integer spins @xmath39 . on the other hand , oshikawa argues that the effect ( assuming for the moment an isotropic exchange interaction , @xmath33 ) of an increase in the easy plane anisotropy @xmath35 is to successively suppress the large @xmath40 states : first @xmath41 , then @xmath42 , and so on .",
    "this yields in his analysis a succession of spin chains with effective spin lengths @xmath43 . the enviseaged succession of spin models can be schematically drawn in the aklt picture as in figure [ fig : oshiprop ] .    as the string order parameter should be alternatingly zero and non - zero in the even and odd integer spin chains ,",
    "oshikawa predicts a succession of @xmath44 phases with @xmath8 phase transitions , beginning with the isotropic haldane phase ( spin length @xmath8 ) and ending with the large-@xmath6 phase , assimilated to a spin length 0 .",
    "the transitions are characterized by the ( dis)appearance of a finite string order parameter .",
    "the classical limit would then emerge by a softening of the quantum phase transitions and a disappearance of possible gaps in the @xmath44 phases .",
    "the aklt scenario works excellently for the @xmath3 case ; and it is extremely well established that a similar scenario , also proposed by oshikawa@xcite , of multiple phase transitions works extremely well to describe successive phase transitions in an isotropic heisenberg integer spin antiferromagnet with increasingly strong dimerization of the interaction bonds , in excellent agreement with field theoretical predictions@xcite and numerical verification@xcite .",
    "all this makes this a very strong scenario .    the existence of an intermediate phase , as should exist for @xmath0 ,",
    "was first established in ref .",
    ", and later confirmed in refs . and .",
    "oshikawa et al.@xcite , using quantum monte carlo on systems up to @xmath45 , claim to see , at least for @xmath46 and @xmath36 , a non - vanishing string order parameter , which they extrapolate to a thermodynamic limit of @xmath47 at that particular point .",
    "they interpret furthermore the behavior of spin - spin correlations as indicative of a phase transition for @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , a sign - alternation exists in the string order at the isotropic point , but not at @xmath49 .",
    "these results would support oshikawa s scenario of multiple transitions .",
    "a third scenario results from numerical work by schollwck et al@xcite ( figure [ fig : s2scholl ] ) .",
    "it actually has a precursor in the works of khveshchenko and chubukov@xcite .",
    "they argue that the large-@xmath6 phase moves as @xmath27 up to @xmath34 for @xmath4 , while the haldane phase recedes to the isotropic point .",
    "the xy phase already present in the @xmath3 phase diagram invades the emptied part of the phase diagram ; in the xy phase the hidden order parameter is zero in the thermodynamic limit . the @xmath3 case with its strict @xmath50 transition line between xy and haldane phase emerges thus as particular .",
    "numerically it is found that the haldane phase is reduced to a small stripe next to the antiferromagnetic phase and squeezed out for @xmath51 , as the gap is suppressed exponentially as @xmath52 ; the large-@xmath6 phase moves up to @xmath34 , and the classical phase diagram emerges in a particularly simple fashion .",
    "there is no clear information on the behavior of the haldane phase at its two end points .",
    "it is not clear whether ( i ) the haldane phase touches the large-@xmath6 phase at its top right end point and ( ii ) whether xy and afm phase meet at its left end .",
    "if both are true , then not only the same phases , but also the same phase boundaries as in the bosonization picture emerge ; the phase diagram looks still quite different .",
    "numerically , the existence of an additional phase between the haldane and the large-@xmath6 phase has been demonstrated@xcite using the dmrg@xcite . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the transition points were placed at @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the intermediate phase was identified as gapless , with exponentially decaying @xmath55 correlations , power - law like decay in the @xmath56 correlations , and a vanishing string order parameter , in support of the above picture .",
    "however , available computational ressources did not allow a very precise determination of the quantities involved ( lengths up to 200 , keeping 200 block states in the dmrg ) .",
    "1truecm    recently , nomura and kitazawa , combining exact diagonalization and field theory techniques , have shown@xcite that there are , on the @xmath33 line , two phase transitions , one from the haldane phase to an xy phase , one from an xy phase to a large-@xmath6 phase .",
    "they localise their transitions at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "while the first result is in good agreement with dmrg results , the second is not .",
    "as the gap opens exponentially weak , the dmrg , which determines the gap directly , has difficulty in extracting such a transition point ; fits to an exponential law are hindered by the presence of small additive errors which become important when the gap approaches @xmath59 .",
    "however , evaluating new , more precise dmrg data with this fit formula shows that @xmath60 was overestimated in ref .",
    "; with higher precision , we can show a gap down to @xmath61 .",
    "in essence , the findings do agree , and the identification of the phase is the same in both works , at least on the @xmath33 line . the numerical data in ref .",
    "leaves however open the possibility that the phase with a non - vanishing string order parameter proposed by oshikawa might be located closer to the point where the large-@xmath6 and antiferromagnetic phase meet directly .",
    "we will address this question now .",
    "\\1 . before we discuss our results on gaps and correlation functions , a remark on the calculation of the string order parameter",
    "is in order , as the crucial information is whether it is finite or not in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "conventionally , the string order parameter is defined by @xmath62 this means that the exponential string includes _ one _ of the two spins correlated . in the @xmath3 literature ,",
    "numerically often two alternative quantities are calculated : an order parameter with a string including _ both _ correlated spins , @xmath63 and an order parameter including _ none _ of the correlated spins , @xmath64 obviously , this changes some of the signs of contributions to the expectation value , depending of the actual value of the correlated spins . in the @xmath3 case , it is obvious that a sign change occurs exactly in all contributions that are not zero , where both @xmath65",
    ". therefore @xmath66 strictly . in the @xmath0 case , this is no longer true : @xmath67 and @xmath68 lead to different sign behavior in the three definitions .",
    "it is however , if computational ressources are stretched to their limit , more efficient for memory consumption reasons to calculate either @xmath69 or @xmath70 in the dmrg method because then the string can be decomposed into two symmetric parts , if @xmath71 and @xmath72 are chosen symmetric about the chain center of an open chain .",
    "only one needs to be stored then .",
    "we have checked in lower precision calculations ( 200 states kept , length 200 ) that in the region of importance the following inequality is always observed : @xmath73 the very small difference in these correlations decreases with increasing @xmath74 both absolutely and relatively .",
    "therefore , in the following , we always refer to the calculation of @xmath75 .",
    "it provides both an upper bound to @xmath76 and converges to the same thermodynamic limit for @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , on all our plots the difference between the various correlations would be invisible to the eye .",
    "an observation that can be made numerically is that the string order parameter at @xmath78 , @xmath33 decays with alternating sign , whereas in the intermediate phase it decays with no sign - alternation .",
    "this might be attributed to a substantial difference between the various @xmath0 phases , as it has been done in ref .  .",
    "alternatively , this might naively be attributed to the fact that @xmath35 suppresses both large @xmath40 values and leads to a very fast decay of @xmath79 correlations : with @xmath33 , spin - spin correlations are antiferromagnetic for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "this introduces a fundamental sign - alternation in the string order .",
    "what is effectively observed , now depends on the string : for @xmath80 and @xmath33 , the close neighbourhood of the ising afm phase indicates that @xmath67 states dominate in the string , contributing factors 1 .",
    "the string order parameter therefore exhibits sign - alternation .",
    "when @xmath6 is successively increased , @xmath68 and then @xmath81 states dominate , introducing a sign alternation in the string for the former and no alternation for the latter case , such that the total order parameter is non - alternating and then alternating again .    calculating chains up to length @xmath82 with the dmrg",
    ", we find for @xmath83 that the string order parameter shows sign - alternation for small distances , but no sign - alternation for longer distances .",
    "as we find ( see below ) a rather strong dependence of the string order parameter on the total system size if the string length becomes of the order of the system size , we have localized this `` crossover '' of the sign - behavior for various total system lengths . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the crossover point is sufficiently small compared to the total system length that it may be considered almost converged ; the numerical data does not exclude the possibility that the sign crossover can already be observed for smaller @xmath85 .",
    "we find crossover points as in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the sign crossover can be attributed to rather strong short ranged neel like order , which is still present for small @xmath6 , but does not survive for larger distances .",
    "it is of no importance whatsoever for larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "the change in behavior is gradual and not directly linked to the critical value of @xmath86    for the large-@xmath6 phase , the second change in sign behavior is not observed up to @xmath87 , which is already deep in the large-@xmath6 phase ( gap of the order 0.05 ) .",
    "this establishes that there is no direct relationship between the phase transitions and the sign behaviour of the string order ; a non - alternating decay is no unique feature of the intermediate phase .",
    "furthermore , we have compared the decay of various correlation functions in the xy phase . in all points",
    ", we find a very fast exponential decay of @xmath79 correlations , and power - law decays in the string order and the @xmath7 correlations .",
    "the decay of the string order is much faster than that of the typical xy phase correlations , even though the difference decreases towards the upper right corner of the xy phase .",
    "we see no change in behavior between @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",
    "to give an example , decays follow laws @xmath88 , with @xmath89 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath91 for the @xmath7 correlations and @xmath94 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath95 for @xmath93 , @xmath91 for the string order .",
    "this is indicative of the xy nature of the intermediate phase .    \\4 . before we discuss results on the string order in the intermediate phase ,",
    "let us first try to locate it with more precision .",
    "we consider only the part of the phase diagram with @xmath28 and @xmath35 ( figure [ fig : points ] )",
    ".    the transition line from the afm phase to the haldane or large-@xmath6 phases can be easily located with the behavior of the @xmath79 correlation function .",
    "considering chains up to length @xmath96 , this transition line was determined with a precision of @xmath97 in the critical @xmath6-value .",
    "the haldane phase is very narrow ( cf .",
    "former results for @xmath33@xcite ) , approximately 0.1 wide in units of @xmath6 .",
    "a more precise determination has not yet been carried out , only at @xmath98 ( considered above ) and @xmath99 ( see below ) .",
    "the crucial question is the location of the transition from the intermediate to the large-@xmath6 phase , because the gap in the large-@xmath6 phase opens exponentially slow . here , we have calculated the gap in high - precision calculations ( 300 states kept , length 300 ) for various values of @xmath6 for @xmath100 .",
    "the fact that the gap is very small ( or vanishes ) implies an extremely large or divergent @xmath101 , which has the advantage that a simple @xmath102-extrapolation of the gap should provide a rather precise estimate of the gap ( cf .  the detailed discussion of such extrapolations in refs . ) .",
    "dmrg errors cancel to some extent as both ground and first excited state have similar truncation errors ( approximately @xmath103 or better for @xmath104 and @xmath105 states kept ) .",
    "variation of the number @xmath106 of kept states reveals that we overestimate gaps slightly . extrapolation in @xmath106 as well as gap calculations for points where",
    "the gap is known to disappear let us estimate that gap values @xmath107 are really finite",
    ". consider figure [ fig : gaps ] . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the truncation error is comparatively large , @xmath108 .",
    "the very small gaps observed leave two scenarios : ( i ) between the haldane phase ( @xmath109 ) and the large-@xmath6 phase ( for d larger than @xmath110 ) there is a small intermediate phase ; ( ii ) haldane and large-@xmath6 phase meet directly , at @xmath111 . for smaller @xmath20 ,",
    "the two phases can be clearly separated , still there is some uncertainty as regards the transition to the large-@xmath6 phase .",
    "this leads us to the diagram shown in figure [ fig : points ] ; the upper transition line might in reality be somewhat lower ( by no more than 0.2 units in @xmath6 close to the upper right end of the xy phase ; the transition point for @xmath36 is essentially exact ) . in any case",
    ", if we _ over_estimate the size of the intermediate phase , there is no finite string order in the true intermediate phase if we do nt find it in our oversized one .",
    "so our argument is not weakened .",
    "in fact , most of our points are far from the transition line anyways .",
    "\\5 . within the intermediate phase",
    "thus identified we are now going to calculate the thermodynamic limit of the string order for a large number of points .    to discuss the possibility of an oshikawa - like phase in the upper right corner , we will systematically investigate points for large @xmath112 .",
    "our procedure to calculate the thermodynamic limit of the string order parameter is as follows . using the dmrg , we calculate for a given set of @xmath113 the string order parameter @xmath114 with @xmath115 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 symmetric about the center of an open chain of length @xmath116 studied using a reduced hilbert space of @xmath106 states per block .    to obtain the thermodynamic limit @xmath117",
    ", we first have to eliminate the dmrg typical dependence on @xmath106 of an order parameter for given @xmath118 , @xmath116 .",
    "this extrapolation can be done by fitting the string order against the dmrg truncation error .",
    "we find that for @xmath105 the errors in the extrapolated results are of no relevance to the following extrapolations .",
    "having obtained @xmath119 , we now have to take the thermodynamic limit first in @xmath116 and @xmath118 .",
    "the numerical result is an interplay of both the finite @xmath118 and @xmath116 ; as can be seen from the example shown in figure [ fig : loglog ] , the influence of finite @xmath116 is strong . in ref .",
    ", these two limits are essentially taken at the same time , with @xmath120 ; to take this into account , a conformal field theory formula for correlations in systems with periodic boundary condition was used .",
    "as the power - law extracted seems in very good accordance with our findings , which consider however much larger systems ( @xmath104 vs.  @xmath45 ) , we attribute the deviations found in that reference to the evaluation of the monte - carlo data used . keeping @xmath118 fixed ,",
    "we find that the convergence of the string order parameter to thermodynamic limit value for fixed @xmath118 is extremely well fitted by a @xmath102 law , if @xmath118 is up to @xmath121 ; for larger @xmath118 , effects from the open chain ends start to dominate . for @xmath118 less than @xmath122 ,",
    "the extrapolation correction is virtually negligible .",
    "we thus get @xmath123 .",
    "this value can now safely be extrapolated to @xmath117 .",
    "we find numerically that @xmath124 vs.  @xmath118 can for @xmath118 not too small ( such that lattice effects disappear ) be extremely well fitted by power laws such as @xmath125 as expected in a critical phase , where @xmath126 varies slowly .",
    "the exponent @xmath126 is given in table [ tab : table2 ] for our representative highest precision points ; all points calculated at less computational expense reflect the given results .",
    "the law expected in a massless phase from conformal field theory is @xmath127 for conformal weight @xmath128 .",
    "we observe therefore a decay of the string order to zero in the thermodynamic limit in the intermediate phase , following a typical decay law of a massless phase , which we identify as an xy phase .",
    "it can also be observed that the exponent @xmath126 decreases with increasing @xmath20 and increases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "in our opinion , our numerical findings together with the analysis of nomura and kitazawa@xcite show that the emergence of the classical limit is governed by the third scenario of an almost classical phase diagram for @xmath0 ( figure [ fig : s2scholl ] ) .    why the failure of the aklt model to account for the phase diagram of the @xmath0 ( and thus @xmath129 ) phase diagram under the introduction of anisotropies , while it is extremely successful both for the isotropic heisenberg model and for higher-@xmath8 spin chains with dimerization ?",
    "in our view the failure is largely and simply due to the fact that the whole construction of the aklt model(s ) for various spin lengths @xmath8 resides entirely on the use of singlet spin - spin bonds . at the isotropic point , each of these singlet bonds is separated from the neglected triplets by an energy roughly of the order of the gap energy .",
    "dimerization is rotationally invariant and accounted for by singlet redistribution between neighboring bonds .",
    "anisotropies however destroy rotational invariance , splitting the triplet states , and lower the energetic distance between the singlet and the lowest triplet state(s ) .",
    "a description of the chain simply in terms of singlets then quickly becomes inadequate .",
    "obviously the @xmath3 phase diagram has a very special property in that its xy and haldane phases are separated by @xmath50 strictly , which is linked to the fact that the @xmath3 chain can be mapped to a six vertex times ising model@xcite , a mapping which is not possible for higher spins .",
    "the @xmath0 phase diagram reveals no such special property .",
    "it might therefore be conjectured that the @xmath3 case itself is particular among integer spins and @xmath0 the really generic case .",
    "all calculations were performed on a pentiumpro 200 mhz linux and an alpha 533 mhz linux machine ( up to @xmath130 , @xmath96 ) , and a cray t3e ( up to @xmath105 , @xmath104 ) .",

    ".position of crossover from alternating to non - alternating sign behavior of the string order parameter for chain length @xmath116 , @xmath36 , and on - site anisotropy @xmath6 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in this paper we study an antiferromagnetic heisenberg @xmath0 quantum spin chain at @xmath1 with both interaction and on - site anisotropy , @xmath2 while the phase diagram of this chain for @xmath3 and the isotropic point for @xmath0 are by now excellently understood , contradictory scenarios exist for the @xmath0 anisotropic phase diagram , which imply completely different mechanisms of the emergence of the classical @xmath4 limit , hence the importance of the question . one main scenario predicts the emergence of a cascade of phase transitions not seen in the @xmath3 case , based on an analysis using the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki model . </S>",
    "<S> another scenario is in favor of an almost classical phase diagram for @xmath0 , from which the @xmath5 phase diagram evolves quite trivially ; the @xmath3 case then emerges as very special with its dominant quantum effects . </S>",
    "<S> numerical studies have so far not been conclusive .    </S>",
    "<S> using the density matrix renormalization group , we study gaps and correlation functions in the anisotropic @xmath0 chain . </S>",
    "<S> the question of the existence of hidden topological order in the anisotropic @xmath0 chain is emphasised , as it distinguishes between the proposed scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> careful extrapolation allows us to show that the topological order is zero in the thermodynamical limit in all disordered phases , in particular in the new phase interposed between the haldane and large-@xmath6 phases . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the hidden order is substantially faster than that of @xmath7 correlations and excellently fitted by power - laws typical of massless phases . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes the aklt - model based scenario in favor of an almost classical phase diagram for the @xmath0 and thus higher spin chains . </S>"
