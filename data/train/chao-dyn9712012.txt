    "chaotic behaviour is a characteristic feature of the overwhelming majority of deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "classical chaos manifests itself in the exponential sensitivity of the trajectories with respect to the initial conditions and has nicely been understood as the very complex topological process of ever lasting stretching and folding of the motion . in view of the complexity of chaotic trajectories",
    "it appears hard to imagine that chaotic motion could be described by means of closed analytical formulae . to our knowledge there",
    "exists only one exception , i.e. dynamical law , which allows the representation of its chaotic trajectories for arbitrarily long times in a closed analytical form : the solutions of the logistic map in the ergodic chaotic limit are given by the celebrated pincherl@xmath0 relation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our lack of knowledge concerning exact expressions for chaotic motion there exists a well - founded and justified interest in obtaining solutions to ergodic and chaotic behaviour .    on the o.h.s .",
    "it is clear that the frequently used numerical solutions of chaotic dynamical systems do not yield one and the same trajectory for long time scales @xcite . nevertheless due to the shadowing argument statistical quantitites of chaotic ergodic systems with and without external noise can in many cases",
    "approximately be obtained through a numerical investigation @xcite .",
    "however there are exceptions like the case when a lyapunov exponent fluctuates about zero and this is expected to be common in simulations of higher - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to make exact properties accessible : if the exact trajectory could be derived this would be an excellent starting - point for calculating the exact correlation function , invariant measure , lyapunov exponent or other quantities @xcite .",
    "in particular it would also offer the possibility of determining the exact long time behaviour of relevant physical quantities .",
    "even more important may be the fact that analytical representations of chaotic motion are of principle interest and can certainly enhance our understanding of the complexity of chaotic dynamics in general .",
    "typical questions which could then be addressed are : how does the exponential sensitivity with respect to the initial conditions come about ? are there any characteristic ( scaling ) properties and/or self - similar structures of the analytical expressions which are responsible for the complex stretching and folding process of chaotic dynamics ?",
    "the current investigation represents a first step in the above direction and provides closed analytical formulae for two classes of one dimensional unimodal , dissipative , ergodic and chaotic maps of the interval each containing an infinite number of members .",
    "in particular we will derive exact solutions for two classes of maps : the conjugates to both the symmetric as well as asymmetric tent maps .",
    "using these solutions we will derive exact expressions for important physical quantitites like , for example , the correlation function .",
    "some specific examples are discussed in detail thereby demonstrating the deviation of exact and numerically determined properties .",
    "let us begin our investigation by considering the symmetric tent map ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-th iterate of the stm @xmath2 possesses @xmath3 monotonicity intervals with alternating constant slopes @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the zeros and maximas are at the positions @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "this makes it possible to represent @xmath2 in the form @xmath7 & \\\\ & -2^nx+2k & ; \\;x\\in [ \\frac{2k-1}{2^n},\\frac{2k}{2^n } ] & \\label{tentna}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right\\}\\ ] ] the above formula can be recast into the following very simple expression @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the modulo operation .",
    "we consider now the family of maps @xmath10 which are obtained from the stm by conjugation with an invertible and differentiable function @xmath11 which maps the unit interval onto itself and obeys @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-th iterates of the maps @xmath13 are then given by @xmath14 and therefore @xmath15 takes on the following appearance @xmath16 which represents a closed form analytical solution to the dynamics of the maps conjugated to the stm .",
    "the general conjugation yields a variety of symmetric as well as nonsymmetric maps .",
    "imposing the restrictive condition @xmath17 for the conjugating functions @xmath11 we obtain the special class of so - called doubly symmetric maps for which both the invariant density as well as the map is symmetric . in particular if we use the specific conjugation @xmath18 and correspondingly @xmath19 we arrive at the logistic map @xmath20 and after a little algebra at the pincherl@xmath0 relation @xmath21\\right\\}$ ] for the @xmath1-th iterate of the logistic map .",
    "eq.(4 ) nicely demonstrates the exponential sensitivity with respect to the initial conditions as well as the infinite process of stretching and folding .",
    "the stretching process takes place through the multiplication with an exponential factor ( @xmath3 ) and the folding through the @xmath9-function which cuts with increasing iterations an increasing number of digits making a more detailed specification of the initial conditions necessary in order to describe the actual motion .",
    "since the lyapunov exponent is invariant with respect to conjugation @xcite all members of the above - discussed class of maps possess the same lyapunov exponent @xmath22 . in particular , since @xmath23 is the invariant measure of the stm , the measure of the conjugated maps is @xmath24 and , therefore , varies widely with changing conjugating function .",
    "next let us derive analytical expressions for another important physical quantity namely the correlation function which is defined by @xmath25 with @xmath26 and the mean value @xmath27 let us denote the positions of the zeros and maxima of @xmath15 by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "using the fact that @xmath15 is conjugate to some original map @xmath30 as well as the relation @xmath31 the correlation function can be decomposed as follows @xmath32 in order to provide exact correlation functions for some specific classes of maps we now specialize to the case that @xmath33 is given by the stm . using eq.(1 ) we can derive the following simple structure for the terms of the sum of the correlation function @xmath34 in general the terms @xmath35 can be evaluated analytically as we shall show in the following by means of a few examples .",
    "let us first choose the conjugation @xmath36 which results in the invariant measure @xmath37 and the corresponding normalized power law density @xmath38 .",
    "due to their scaling properties power law densities are of particular interest for physical systems with critical or self - similar behaviour . using eqs.(5,6 )",
    "we arrive after some algebra at the following closed form analytical expressions for the corresponding correlation function @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the complete and incomplete unnormalized beta function , respectively , and @xmath42 is the hypergeometric function . for the particular case @xmath43 the above expression reduces to the @xmath44-correlation @xmath45 as expected .",
    "figure 1a shows the absolute value of the above correlation function for different values of the power @xmath46 .",
    "the short time as well as long time behaviour changes somewhat with changing parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour @xmath47 of @xmath48 is an exponential decay .",
    "the decay constant @xmath49 can be determined using the euler - maclaurin sum formula @xcite for the asymptotic expansion of eq.(7 ) .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath50 @xmath51 while for @xmath52 we have @xmath53 independent of @xmath46 .",
    "having obtained the exact correlation function for the above class of maps with power law density we are in the position to compare these results with those of numerical trajectory simulations .",
    "figure 1b shows the comparison of the exact correlation function for @xmath54 ( full circles ) with the results of numerical trajectory calculations using @xmath55 ( squares ) @xmath56 ( diamonds ) and @xmath57 ( triangles ) points . obviously there is a strong inherent deviation and",
    "in particular it can be observed that an enhancement of the number of points of the numerically calculated trajectory does not yield an improvement in the statistical accuracy of the corresponding correlation functions .",
    "this is due to the fact that a naive numerical simulation looses for the above dynamical systems very rapidly the original trajectory and gets due to numerical inaccuracies trapped on a certain orbit.    finally let us provide one more example out a large number accessible by the above given analytical formulae .",
    "we choose as a conjugating function @xmath58 which results in the measure @xmath59 and the invariant density @xmath60 .",
    "a straightforward but tedious calculation yields the terms @xmath61 which can be summed up to the final beautiful result of the correlation function @xmath62 which shows with respect to its asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath63 ) an exponential decay with a decay constant @xmath64 .",
    "solving the problem of the chaotic and ergodic dynamics generated by the general class of maps conjugated to the asymmetric tent maps ( atm ) @xcite is a much more intricate task than the corresponding solution of the dynamics of the maps conjugate to the stm . in order to develop the necessary concepts and techniques we therefore proceed in several steps .",
    "the knowledge of the position of the minima / maxima , i.e. the length of the monotonicity intervals , of the @xmath1-th iterate of the atm is central to the derivation of an analytical expression for the @xmath1-th iterate of the atm . in the present subsection",
    "we therefore provide a method which allows to determine the length @xmath65 of the @xmath66-th monotonicity interval ( we count the intervals starting from the origin ) by a decomposition technique of the corresponding frequency distribution @xmath67 ( see below ) into independent modes .",
    "the atm is unimodal with constant slopes @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 on the two monotonicity intervals , respectively .",
    "first of all we remark that each iteration process @xmath71 divides a monotonicity interval of the @xmath1-th iterate into two monotonicity intervals of the @xmath72 iterate which possesses positive and negative slopes in these intervals , respectively",
    ". the ratios of their lengths are given by @xmath73 or @xmath74 depending on whether the @xmath1-th iterate of the atm on the original monotonicity interval possesses a positive or negative slope , respectively . in order to specify the length of the @xmath66-th monotonicity interval",
    "we do not need such detailed information like the symbolic sequence @xcite but only the frequency of the occurence of the factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 during the iteration process .",
    "the number of different lengths for the monotonicity intervals is therefore much smaller than the number of monotonicity intervals themselves .",
    "the length of the @xmath66-th monotonicity interval of the @xmath1-th iterate of the atm is given by @xmath77 where @xmath67 is the frequency of the occurence of the factor @xmath76 during the branching process into the final @xmath66-th monotonicity interval of the @xmath1-th iterate .",
    "using the above - described properties of the branching of the monotonicity intervals it can be shown that @xmath67 obeys the following recursion formula @xmath78 @xmath79 can therefore be obtained from @xmath67 through a reflection @xmath80 of the function @xmath81 with respect to the vertical axis located at @xmath82 and subsequent addition @xmath83 of @xmath84 to the attached part of @xmath79 which yields in total @xmath85 .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure 2 for the three functions @xmath86 .    in the following",
    "we derive a decomposition of the functions @xmath67 into different modes , i.e. @xmath67 can then be described by a superposition of these modes .",
    "let us introduce @xmath87 modes @xmath88 and the additional mode @xmath89 .",
    "each mode @xmath90 is defined on the finite support @xmath91 and oscillates as a function of @xmath66 with the period @xmath92 .",
    "in addition it possesses a phase @xmath93 which describes the shifting of the oscillations on the @xmath66-axis . the mode @xmath94 is characterized by the period @xmath95 and the phase @xmath96 .",
    "the equally weighted superposition of these modes yields the quantity @xmath67 , i.e. we have @xmath97 figure 3 illustrates the three modes @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 which are necessary in order to build up @xmath101 .",
    "in particular we now briefly verify that the above decomposition obeys the recursion formula given in eq.(10 ) .",
    "the action of the reflection @xmath80 onto the modes @xmath90 is given by @xmath102 the application of the subsequent addition @xmath83 to the reflected modes corresponds to the inclusion of the mode @xmath103 . in total",
    "we therefore arrive at the desired relation @xmath104 in the following subsection we provide construction principles and closed analytical formulae for the modes @xmath90 and @xmath94 .",
    "each mode function is defined on @xmath3 natural numbers and their continuation and representation on the real axis is therefore not unique . in the present subsection we provide two different representations for the mode functions @xmath90 and @xmath105 .",
    "the first one is characterized by the application of the step function to trigonometric functions and the second one uses polynomials and their periodic continuation in order to describe the modes .",
    "the first step in the derivation of a second , smooth , representation of the modes @xmath90 and @xmath105 is the construction of a polynomial with suitable properties . to achieve this ,",
    "our starting - point is a polynomial @xmath111 which possesses at @xmath112 points @xmath113 the value @xmath114 and at other @xmath112 points @xmath115 the value @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 for the time being the domain of definition of the above introduced polynomial includes @xmath118 integer values and possesses @xmath112 zeros .",
    "such a polynomial can be written as a sum of @xmath118 terms , each of the terms thereby acquires the value @xmath114 or @xmath116 at exactly one position given by @xmath113 or @xmath115 , respectively whereas at all other positions @xmath119,@xmath120 , @xmath121 it vanishes .",
    "these properties are guaranteed if each term consists of a normalized product of linear factors and we therefore arrive at the following expression for the polynomial @xmath111 @xmath122 the points of support @xmath123 , @xmath124 ought to be equidistant in the unit interval @xmath125 $ ] and should be arranged symmetrically with respect to @xmath126 , i.e. we have @xmath127 after a little algebra this leads to an essential simplification of the polynomials ( 17 ) @xmath128 as a next step we perform a periodic continuation of the polynomial @xmath111 by substituting @xmath129 in order to describe the modes with the constructed polynomials we have to adapt the frequency as well as phase of the oscillating periodic functions defined by eqs.(19,20 ) .",
    "in addition a shift is performed in order to make the points of support equal to integers on which the modes are defined .",
    "finally we arrive at the following expressions for the individual modes @xmath130 @xmath131 and for the frequency distribution @xmath67 of the @xmath66-th monotonicity interval    @xmath132    this concludes our construction of the modes .",
    "the knowledge of the frequency distribution @xmath67 is a key ingredient for the derivation of analytical solutions to the chaotic motion of the conjugates of the atm .",
    "arbitrarily high iterates are now accessible in closed analytical form via the following procedure .",
    "first of all we give some important quantities related to the @xmath1-th iterated map :    * the length of the @xmath66-th monotonicity intervals is given by @xmath77 * the slope in the @xmath66-th monotonicity interval is @xmath133 * the left and right boundary @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the @xmath66-th monotonicity interval can be obtained by summation of the lengths of the corresponding intervals : @xmath136 * definition of the index - function : let us define a function @xmath137 \\rightarrow \\left\\{1, ... ,2^{n}\\right\\}$ ] whose value @xmath138 tells us the number of the monotonicity interval in which @xmath139 is contained .",
    "the index function can be described with the help of the step function @xmath140 in the following way @xmath141= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{2^n}\\theta \\left [ x- \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{i-1 } p^{n - r_n(j)}q^{r_n(j)}\\right ] \\ ] ]    we are now in the position of formulating the @xmath1-th iterate @xmath142 of the atm in a closed analytical expression @xmath143\\right \\ } s_n[i_n(x)]+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+(-1)^{i_n(x ) } \\right)\\ ] ] inserting eqs.(26,27 ) into the above expression yields @xmath144 p^{r_n[i_n(x)]-n}q^{-r_n[i_n(x ) ] } ( -1)^{i_n(x)-1 } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+(-1)^{i_n(x)}\\right)\\ ] ] similar to the case of the stm we obtain the @xmath1-th iterate @xmath145 of the maps conjugated to the atm by the following decomposition @xmath146 which gives together with eq.(29 ) our final result @xmath147 s_n\\left(i_n(u^{-1}(x))\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+(-1)^{i_n(u^{-1}(x))}\\right)\\right\\}\\ ] ] eq.(31 ) can be used to calculate arbitrarily high iterates of the conjugates of the atm . as an example",
    "we show in figure 4 the @xmath148-th iterate of the conjugate @xmath149 of the atm for @xmath150 which gives an idea of the scaling structures contained in the above analytical formula .",
    "the invariant measure of the conjugates of the atm is given by @xmath24 and the lyapunov exponent is known to be @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "the above eq.(31 ) can be used to calculate the correlation functions of the conjugates of the atm as well as any other physical property .",
    "we have presented analytical solutions to the chaotic and ergodic dynamics of two classes of noninvertible single humped maps : the conjugates of the symmetric as well as asymmetric tent map . with the exception of the iterates of the logistic map this is , to our knowledge , the first time that closed analytical representations of chaotic trajectories",
    "are derived .",
    "this enables us to calculate exact physical quantities , like , for example , the time correlation function , even in those cases for which numerical trajectory calculations fail to predict the correct long time behaviour . the complex stretching and folding process of the iteration of the dynamical system",
    "is clearly revealed within our analytical approach through the combination of conjugating functions , scale transformations and cut - off operations .",
    "the key to the construction of the analytical solutions is the complex superposition of modes connected with the monotonicity intervals of the @xmath1-th iterate of the dynamical system .",
    "we conjecture that this holds also for the general case of arbitrary single humped maps and might be a hint towards the construction of their solutions .",
