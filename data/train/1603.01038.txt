    "<S> the observed wavelength agrees neither with @xmath22 nor with @xmath23(see supplemental figure 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> even the dependence of the parameters on @xmath24 does not agree . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this discrepancy is natural : pattern formation occurs from the homogeneous limit cycle , which is far from the unstable fixed solution . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the standard analysis for the turing pattern does not work in this system .    </S>",
    "<S> now we need to find a procedure to determine the spatial pattern without utilizing linear stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we note that once the diffusion term is given , the stationary solution @xmath25 can be obtained from the dynamical system of two variables @xmath26 , where standard nullcline analysis works . as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath36 is the rescaled diffusion constant which satisfies @xmath37 . from these equations </S>",
    "<S> , we can derive the spatial map as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inverse function of @xmath4 given that @xmath0 is fixed to @xmath40 , which corresponds to the cross - points of the nullclines . with these equations , @xmath41 is determined from @xmath40 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , while @xmath44 is determined as @xmath45 ( for the use of a `` spatial map '' in the analysis of a spatial pattern , see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , there can be multiple candidate solutions for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , not all of the above solutions are stable in terms of dynamical systems ( [ eq : reaction - diffusion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this solution must be attracted from the uniform oscillatory state . </S>",
    "<S> these properties lead to the following selection principles . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * selection principles *    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> ignore candidates in which the resulting state @xmath46 is not stable against small perturbations in @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> 3 .   calculate @xmath47 from all remaining candidates , and choose the solution that gives the smallest value of @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first criterion is necessary for the stability of the novel fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> the second criterion is necessary for the pattern to emerge from the limit cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the third criterion implies the smallest net diffusion , which minimizes the distance from a uniform state . with the second and third criteria , the solution that is attracted from the uniform oscillatory state </S>",
    "<S> is selected .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of the pattern obtained from the spatial map with the above selection criteria is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , which agrees well with the numerically obtained pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the above procedure works independently of the parameter values , demonstrating its validity .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the spatial periodic pattern is obtained as an attractor of the spatial map ( [ eq : spatialmap ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , independently of the initial condition in the map , the same periodic pattern is selected as long as the initial condition in the spatial map belongs to the basin of the above attractor . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition in the spatial map corresponds to the value of fixed boundary . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a pattern of the same wavelength is reached independently of the boundary value , while the phase of wave pattern is different , which is consistent with the numerical result ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) .    in the state space , </S>",
    "<S> pattern selection using the spatial map can be described as follows . </S>",
    "<S> when the diffusion term is small , the shift of the nullcline is small . </S>",
    "<S> the same stable fixed point , i.e. , @xmath43 on the same branch , continues to exist and is selected according to the above criteria . </S>",
    "<S> with iteration of the spatial map , the shift of the nullcline due to the diffusion term is accumulated and at some point , the fixed point of the same branch vanishes with bifurcation , or do not fulfill selection principles . </S>",
    "<S> the selected fixed point is replaced by that of the new branch , as the solution according to the above criteria . repeating the above procedure </S>",
    "<S> , a periodic pattern is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> this procedure suggests there can be a relationship between the period of oscillation @xmath49 and the wavelength @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> first , by rescaling the spatial scale , the wavelength @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the period is scaled by @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 are similarly scaled by @xmath55 , but this is already set to unity in ( [ eq : reaction - diffusion ] ) . ) now , following the vector field @xmath56 in the state space ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) , @xmath57 oscillates with the period @xmath49 . on the other hand , when a stripe is formed , the `` spatial orbit '' @xmath16 along space @xmath17 orbits the state space similarly to the limit cycle orbit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , except for the vicinity of the hopf bifurcation , we numerically confirmed that one stripe is generated in correspondence with one period of oscillation . with the parameter change , the ( magnitude of ) vector @xmath58 in the state space changes , which changes the rate of change along the limit cycle as well as that of the `` spatial orbit '' in the same way . </S>",
    "<S> if these orbits do not have a small radius in the state space , both speeds are expected to change in proportion , implying that the period @xmath49 and wavelength @xmath50 ( or @xmath59 ) change in proportion . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this is a rough estimate , but this proportionality approximately holds against changes in the parameter values @xmath24 ( and @xmath5 ) , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fixation of the temporal to the spatially periodic pattern as well as the analysis using the spatial map can be generally applied to a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion equation that has a uniform limit - cycle attractor . as another illustration </S>",

    "<S> the approximate proportionality between the period and wavelength is worse than the model ( 2 ) ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) , possibly because the change in the flow @xmath61 against the parameters is highly dependent on the state @xmath62 .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the formation of a periodic pattern from a uniform oscillatory state induced by the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent pattern is predicted as an attractor of the spatial map under the selection principle . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed the generality of this pattern formation in reaction - diffusion systems . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic oscillation exists in a two - component reaction system with negative feedback . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in a system with an activator and an inhibitor , for a certain range of parameters , the spatially periodic pattern that exists as an attractor replaces the uniform oscillatory state , triggered by the fixed boundary condition , if the diffusion of the inhibitor is sufficiently large .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the pattern formation process as well as the nullcline analysis is still valid even for @xmath63 , although the spatial map explicitly includes the inverse function of @xmath1 , which would make the analysis more difficult </S>",
    "<S> .    pattern formation generally depends on the boundary and initial conditions . in the spatial map , </S>",
    "<S> the former is represented by the initial condition in the map , while the latter is considered by the second and third criteria of the selection principle , which indicate that the initial condition is not far from the uniform oscillatory state . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial condition is far from uniformity , local inhomogeneity can grow . in the state - space representation , whether such growth occurs is determined according to the size of the spatial diffusion term , specifically whether the spatial diffusion term is large enough to go across the nullclines and to induce saddle - node bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the condition close to uniformity represents the absence of such inhomogeneity . on the other hand , for such initial conditions to allow for the local growth in inhomogeneity , the selection criteria are replaced so that the choice of the fixed - point solution is close to a given initial condition , leading to a requested switch to a different branch of fixed - points . hence , the choice of the selection principle corresponding to the initial condition can predict the emergent pattern . </S>",
    "<S> control of an emergent pattern is thus possible by manipulating the initial condition .    here </S>",
    "<S> , one stripe is formed with one - to - one correspondence of one oscillation period in time . near the hopf bifurcation point , however , a complex pattern with one stripe is observed per few periods of oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the spatial map can have an attractor with such complex ( or quasiperiodic ) oscillation in the vicinity of the bifurcation and also by modifying the selection principle . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of such complex patterns in terms of the spatial map ( see also @xcite ) will be of interest in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental confirmation of the present pattern formation will be possible in reaction - diffusion systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , relevance of boundary condition to pattern selection should be of importance because the real experimental system is finite and often under a fixed boundary condition . by carefully examining the boundary effects </S>",
    "<S> , we can confirm the present pattern formation mechanism , where the period - wavelength relationship ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) will be confirmed .    as mentioned in the introduction , spatial pattern formation based on temporal oscillation </S>",
    "<S> is often observed in biological morphogenesis@xcite as well as in the numerical evolution of morphogenesis@xcite , where the relevance of cell - cell interaction has been recently discussed in addition to the external morphogen gradient@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the simplicity in our mechanism , which only requires diffusion of the inhibitor and a fixed boundary , we expect that it could be adopted in biological development , which will be confirmed by examining cell - cell interaction and boundary effects .    </S>",
