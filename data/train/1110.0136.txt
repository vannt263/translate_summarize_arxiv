    "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite , in which an optimal level of noise allows a nonlinear system to follow the periodicity of the input signal , received ample attention in a number of disciplines over the last decades .",
    "the term stochastic resonance was introduced by benzi , parisi , sutera and vulpiani @xcite in their original conjecture explaining the earth s ice ages periodicities .",
    "the word resonance referred to the existence of a maximum in the system s response synchronous with the periodic input , observed for a certain amplitude of the noise .",
    "initial theoretical work to understand sr on discrete or continuous bistable models emphasized the non - linear aspects of the phenomenology @xcite , while other efforts @xcite noted that its main aspects can be described within the framework of linear response theory , such as for example the relation between the sinusoidal input and the spectral output component of the same frequency .",
    "while sr was initially considered to be restricted to the case of periodic input signals , now it is widely used including aperiodic or broadband input signals .",
    "differences exist also in current measures of the system s output performance : the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is used for periodic inputs , mutual information for random or aperiodic signals and linear correlation between output and input signals in other cases .",
    "this introductory review is dedicated to a variant of sr termed ghost stochastic resonance ( gsr ) which is ubiquitous for nonlinear systems driven by noise and periodic signals with _",
    "more than one frequency_. gsr was first proposed @xcite to explain how a single neuron suffices to detect the periodicities of complex sounds . later",
    ", similar dynamics was found to describe the quasi - periodicity observed in abrupt temperature shifts during the last ice age , known as dansgaard - oeschger ( do ) events @xcite .",
    "between these two examples , other manifestations of gsr were subsequently identified in disparate systems including neurons , semiconductors lasers , electronic circuits , visual stimuli , etc . in the following sections gsr",
    "will be reviewed including its main underlying ingredients and the most relevant manifestations in different natural phenomena .      to introduce the main aspects of gsr",
    ", we will use two examples where a system responds with spectral components which are not present in their inputs .",
    "pitch is a subjective attribute by which any sound can be ordered on a linear scale from low to high .",
    "if a tone is composed of a single frequency , the perceived pitch is its frequency . in the case of complex sounds , composed of several pure tones ,",
    "there is no an objective measure of the pitch , despite the fact that the accuracy of different observers to distinguish between different complex sounds can be as small as a few percents , even for untrained ears .",
    "a well known illusion used to study pitch perception takes place when two tones of different frequencies are heard together .",
    "the paradox is that , under these conditions , the perception corresponds to a third , lower pitched , tone and not to any of the two frequencies .",
    "this is referred to as the _ missing fundamental illusion _ because the perceived pitch corresponds to a fundamental frequency for which there is no actual source of air vibration .",
    "a characteristic phenomenon in pitch perception is the so - called _",
    "pitch shift_. this refers to the variation of the perceived pitch when the frequencies of an harmonic tone are rigidly displaced .",
    "the first quantitative measurements of this phenomena are reproduced in fig.[fig_schou ] ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the experiment is described as follows : a sinusoidal amplitude modulated sound :    @xmath0    is presented to a group of subjects which were asked to report the perceived pitch .",
    "this is a complex tone composed by three components equi - spaced in frequency by a value @xmath1 . if @xmath2 with @xmath3 integer , the three tones are higher harmonics of the fundamental @xmath1 . if the three components are displaced by @xmath4 , e.g , @xmath5 , the three tones are no longer higher harmonics of @xmath1 ( @xmath1 is not the missing fundamental ) but the difference between them remains equal to @xmath1 .",
    "these stimuli are represented in the top diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig_schou ] for @xmath6  hz , @xmath7  khz and @xmath4 between @xmath8 and @xmath9  khz .",
    "it was assumed for many years that , under these experimental conditions , the auditory system would report a pitch corresponding to nonlinear distortions @xcite . in other words ,",
    "pitch perception would be related to the difference between the intervening tones .",
    "if that were the case , the reported pitch should remain constant ( i.e. , the red dashed line of bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_schou ] ) .",
    "instead , the reported pitches fall along straight lines of slopes close ( but not exactly ) to @xmath10 . in addition , there is a notorious ambiguity in the judgement , which is peculiar in the sense that although the same stimulus may produce different percepts they group in well defined values of pitch .",
    "the results in section [ secpitch ] will show that all of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these experiments can be replicated at once in terms of ghost stochastic resonance .",
    "many paleoclimatic records from the north atlantic region and eurasia show a pattern of rapid climate oscillations , the so - called dansgaard - oeschger ( do ) events @xcite , which seem to exhibit a characteristic recurrence time scale of about @xmath11  years during the second half of the last glacial period @xcite .",

    "this work indicates that the apparent @xmath11  year response time of the events could result from a superposition of two shorter input cycles , together with a strong nonlinearity and a millennial relaxation time in the dynamics of the system as another manifestation of the gsr , as will be discussed in section [ sec : d - o ] .",

    "this analysis was addressed in braun et al .",
    "@xcite who reported in their supplementary material that such changes typically alter the average inter - event waiting time by less than 20 per cent , consistent with the results presented in the supplementary material of a successive study @xcite .",
    "another effect discovered in both studies is that the dispersion of the inter - event waiting time distribution increases when the system is driven out of the resonance case by a change in any of the forcing frequencies .",
    "thus , the phenomenon was found to be stable under changes of the input frequencies .",
    "besides the question of _ how _ pitch is perceived , another contested debate relates to _ where _ perception takes place .",
    "although interval statistics of the neuronal firings @xcite show that pitch information is already encoded in peripheral neurons , under other conditions pitch perception can take place at a higher level of neuronal processing @xcite .",

    "it is known that in that case a ( rather weak ) low - frequency pitch is perceived .",
    "this is called `` dichotic pitch '' , and can also arise from the binaural interaction between broad - band noises .",

    "[ fig3lopera ] shows two interesting results : one is that the experimental data follow the theoretical prediction for @xmath26 and @xmath48 ; the second is that there is not ambiguity in resonant frequencies as was reported in the previous sections .",
    "the reason behind this difference is related to the shape of the periodic inputs ( see details in @xcite . ) .",
    "along these notes we have reviewed how a nonlinear system responds to a combination of pure tones with different frequencies .",
    "in all the exposed cases , the input frequencies followed a particular relation : the difference between them was always constant and equal to @xmath28 , which in the harmonic case corresponds to the missing fundamental . in all cases ,",
    "the analyzed systems responded with a preferred frequency which was absent in the input .",
    "the dynamics of nonlinear devices , when stimulated by more than one frequency plus noise , was also studied from related perspectives .",
    "for example , the response of a discrete model system to a dichromatic input in the regimes of stochastic and vibrational resonance was numerically analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the transition between the stochastic resonance regime ( where frequencies are of the same order ) to the vibrational resonance one ( where one of the frequencies is much higher that the other ) was studied in bistable and threshold devices .",
    "similar analysis were carried out experimentally in bistable schmitt trigger circuits @xcite , where the authors analyzed the phenomena of mean switching frequency locking and stochastic synchronization and their dependence on the input parameters .",
    "another perspective in the study of the dynamic of nonlinear devices driven by more than one frequency was carried out in @xcite , where the problem of transport in a noisy environment was studied . in this work ,",
    "ratchet devices were stimulated by two periodic signals with frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 following rational ratios ( i.e. @xmath161 ) .",
    "the results focused on how the rectification of a primary signal by a ratchet could be controlled more effectively if a secondary signal with tunable frequency and phase is applied .",
    "having reviewed the main theoretical aspects of the gsr mechanism and how it contributed to explain real - world problems of active scientific research in such diverse branches as paleoclimatology and neuroscience , open questions certainly remain in at least three aspects of the phenomenon : theoretical insights , new manifestations of the same mechanism and developing of new statistical measures .",
    "it is clear that important efforts are needed to attain analytical descriptions of the gsr mechanism , as was done earlier for the case of stochastic resonance .",
    "a second line of inquire might be directed to uncover new manifestations of the same mechanism . for instance , to study the characteristics of the gsr phenomenon in response to more realistic , non - sinusoidal cycles , since many real - world cyclic processes are far from sinusoidal .",
    "another relevant question may be to investigate the response to input frequencies which are not constant but jitters randomly from one cycle to another , such that noise appears in the frequency rather than in the amplitude domain .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that most of the studies performed so far on the subject of gsr were based on comparably simple , low - dimensional models . since it is not certain up to what degree the complexity of real - world systems ( such as the climate or auditory systems ) can be reduced , future work should focus on the study of this phenomenon in more detailed , higher dimensional models .",
    "finally , future work is required concerning the development of new measures of regularity that are particularly useful to distinguish between a gsr and other related noise induced phenomena in real data .",
    "this includes , among other approaches , rigorous null - hypothesis testing , using modern methods of non - linear time series analysis .",
    "the output of nonlinear systems driven by noise and periodic stimulus with more than one frequency is characterized by the emergence of a  ghost \" frequency which is absent in the input .",
    "this phenomenon , called ghost stochastic resonance , was proposed to explain a well known paradox in psychoacoustic : the missing fundamental illusion .",
    "it was later found to provide a theoretical framework to understand a wide variety of problems , from the perception of pitch in complex sounds or visual stimuli to climate cycles .",
    "the robustness of this phenomenon relies in two simple ingredients which are necessary to the emergence of gsr : the linear interference of the periodic inputs and a nonlinear detection of the largest constructive interferences , involving a noisy threshold .",
    "theoretical analysis showed that when the input frequencies are higher harmonics of some missing fundamental @xmath28 , the predominant output frequency is @xmath28 . on the other hand , when the input frequencies are still spaced by @xmath28 but they are no longer higher harmonic of @xmath28 , the predominant response frequencies follow a family of linear functions described by eq.[deltaf ] . the remarkable agreement found between theory , simulations and experiments is parameter independent and able to explain problems in a wide variety of systems ranging from neurons , semiconductor lasers , electronic circuits to models of glacial climate cycles .",
