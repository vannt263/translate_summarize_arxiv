    "let @xmath0 be a finite group and @xmath1 a normal subgroup such that the quotient  @xmath7 is cyclic . in this paper",
    "we establish a quite general result ( theorem [ mt ] ) about the distribution of the conjugacy classes of @xmath0 between the cosets of @xmath1 . a key idea in this work is that of the centralizing subgroup of a conjugacy class ; the centralizing subgroup of @xmath3 is defined to be the smallest subgroup of  @xmath0 containing both  @xmath1 and the centralizer  @xmath8 .",
    "this subgroup determines how the class splits when the conjugacy action is restricted to subgroups of @xmath0 containing  @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate that the centralizing subgroup is fundamental to an understanding of the distribution of the conjugacy classes of @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ mt ] states that the conjugacy classes with a particular centralizing subgroup  @xmath5 are equally distributed amongst the cosets of @xmath1 in @xmath5 ; the proof occupies the greater part of the paper . in section [ application ]",
    "we present an interesting application of theorem  [ mt ] : enumerating the conjugacy classes of a subgroup @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 in terms of the numbers of conjugacy classes of @xmath0 contained in various subgroups .",
    "the reader may recognize that our main result has a character - theoretic flavour .",
    "indeed it seems likely that theorem  [ mt ] can be proved by character theory : specifically by means of a combination of clifford theory and brauer s permutation lemma ( for an account of these subjects see @xcite ) .",
    "so far as the authors have investigated , it appears unlikely that such an approach will lead to a shorter proof than the elementary one given here .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mt ] relies on a preliminary result ( lemma [ pl ] ) , which states that the number of conjugacy classes in a generating coset of @xmath2 is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of @xmath0 contained in @xmath1 which do not split when the action by conjugacy is restricted to @xmath1 .",
    "although the proof of this result is straightforward , we are not aware of any previous appearance of the fact in the literature , at least in this general form . the special case where @xmath9 is of course well known and often cited , partly because of its usefulness in deriving the character table of @xmath10 from that of @xmath11 ; see  @xcite for example .    in @xcite the authors present a result which relies upon a special case of lemma  [ pl ] , together with hall s marriage theorem .",
    "it is shown , in the case where @xmath12 is prime , that the set of conjugacy classes whose centralizing group is @xmath0 can be partitioned in such a way that each part contains one class from each coset , and any two classes in the same part contain elements which commute with one another .",
    "the importance of lemma  [ pl ] in the present paper is that it can be used to derive a set of linear equations which relate the numbers of conjugacy classes in different cosets of @xmath1 which have a given centralizing subgroup .",
    "this allows us to reduce the problem to one of linear algebra : namely , finding the dimension of one of the eigenspaces of a certain matrix .",
    "a further reduction of the problem by means of a tensor factorization allows us to focus on the case where @xmath2 is a cyclic @xmath13-group ; in this form , the problem turns out to be readily soluble .    from this brief description of the proof",
    ", it will be clear to the reader that the proof is to be presented backwards .",
    "rather than building up to the main theorem , we shall proceed by reducing it by stages to a simpler problem .",
    "our justification for this _ modus operandi _ , if one is needed , is that it seems the most  perhaps the only  coherent way to present the argument .",
    "we have not attempted to deal with cases where @xmath2 is non - cyclic . that the quotient should be abelian",
    "is necessary ( and sufficient ) for each conjugacy class to lie wholly within a single coset .",
    "the case of a non - cyclic , abelian quotient seems problematic however ; for example , if  @xmath0 is nilpotent of class  @xmath14 , and  @xmath1 is the centre of  @xmath0 , then the elements of @xmath0 whose centralizing subgroup is  @xmath0 are precisely the elements of  @xmath1 .",
    "this precludes the possibility of a result directly analogous to theorem  [ mt ] ; however our methods do seem to provide some information about the general case , and the problem is surely worthy of further study . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the convention that a summation sign indicates a sum over a single variable , which is in every case the variable denoted by the first letter appearing in the conditions below the sign .",
    "throughout this paper , we shall assume that @xmath0 is a finite group , and that @xmath1 is a normal subgroup of @xmath0 such that @xmath2 is cyclic .",
    "for an element @xmath15 , we define the _ centralizing subgroup _",
    "@xmath16 of  @xmath17 with respect to @xmath1 , to be @xmath4 . for each conjugacy class @xmath18 of @xmath0 , we define the centralizing subgroup @xmath19 to be @xmath16 for an element @xmath20 .    in the present section we consider centralizing subgroups only with respect to @xmath1 , and shall not always mention @xmath1 explicitly . later in the paper , however , we shall have occasion to refer to centralizing subgroups with respect to other subgroups of @xmath0 .    we can now state our main theorem .",
    "[ mt ] let @xmath0 be a finite group , and let @xmath1 be a normal subgroup of @xmath0 such that  @xmath2 is cyclic .",
    "let  @xmath5 be such that @xmath6 .",
    "then the @xmath0-conjugacy classes contained in @xmath5 whose centralizing subgroup is @xmath5 , are equally distributed between the cosets of @xmath1 in @xmath5 .    before introducing the lemma which will be the principal tool in the proof of theorem [ mt ] , it is convenient to make the following definition .",
    "we define an _ integral @xmath21-class _ to be a conjugacy class of @xmath0 whose centralizing subgroup with respect to @xmath1 is @xmath0 .",
    "equivalently , an integral @xmath21-class is one which does not split when the conjugacy action is restricted to @xmath1 .",
    "[ pl ] suppose that the coset @xmath22 is a generator of the quotient group  @xmath2 .",
    "then the number of conjugacy classes contained in @xmath22 is equal to the number of integral  @xmath21-classes contained in @xmath1 .    if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath25 meets every coset of @xmath1 in @xmath0 , and in particular it meets @xmath22 . now",
    "the number of integral @xmath21-classes in @xmath1 is @xmath26 which is the number of conjugacy classes in @xmath22 .",
    "this establishes the lemma .",
    "we now want to widen our focus in two respects : by including conjugacy classes whose centralizing group is a proper subgroup of @xmath0 , and by considering all of the cosets of @xmath1 in @xmath0 .",
    "the following lemma lays the foundations .",
    "the number of conjugacy classes with a particular centralizing subgroup is equal in cosets of equal order in  @xmath2 , since a conjugacy class in  @xmath22 is mapped by  @xmath27 to a conjugacy class in  @xmath28 , while the centralizing subgroup is invariant .",
    "it follows that we lose nothing by selecting a representative coset of each order in @xmath2 .",
    "the following definition takes advantage of this fact .    in terms of this new notation",
    ", we may restate theorem [ mt ] simply as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ". then @xmath31 .",
    "by multiple applications of lemma [ pl ] we derive a set of linear equations in the quantities  @xmath32 , allowing us to reduce the proof of theorem [ mt ] to a problem of linear algebra . to obtain the linear equations , we need for each particular choice of  @xmath33 , to express the following numbers in terms of the quantities",
    "@xmath32 :    1 .   the number @xmath34 of integral @xmath35-classes in @xmath36 , 2 .   the number @xmath37 of integral @xmath35-classes in a generating coset of @xmath38 .",
    "lemma [ pl ] tells us that these numbers are equal .",
    "we first handle the quantity @xmath34 .",
    "it is straightforward to identify the @xmath0-conjugacy classes of  @xmath36 whose centralizing subgroups with respect to  @xmath36 , contain @xmath39 .",
    "but it is necessary to allow for the fact that these classes may split when the conjugacy action is restricted to @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , a @xmath0-conjugacy class in @xmath36 with centralizing subgroup @xmath40 splits into @xmath41 classes under the action of  @xmath39 . if @xmath42 is a divisor of @xmath43 , then @xmath36 contains @xmath44 cosets of @xmath1 whose order in @xmath2 is @xmath42 , where @xmath45 is euler s totient function ; one of these is our representative coset @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that an element of @xmath46 has centralizing subgroup @xmath40 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "then its centralizing subgroup with respect to @xmath36 is @xmath47 .",
    "so the quantity @xmath34 is given by the formula @xmath48    to find @xmath37 in terms of the quantities @xmath32 , we need to describe a generating coset of  @xmath38 as a union of cosets of  @xmath1 .",
    "this requires us to look at the arithmetic of @xmath43 and @xmath49 a little more closely .",
    "[ gcl ] suppose that @xmath50 , and let @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the largest divisor of @xmath43 coprime with  @xmath53 .",

    "an element of order @xmath61 in @xmath55 is contained in a generating coset of @xmath56 if and only if @xmath62 .",
    "suppose that this is the case .",
    "if @xmath13 is a prime divisor of @xmath49 which does not divide  @xmath52 , then  @xmath63 , the highest power of  @xmath13 dividing  @xmath49 , is strictly greater than the highest power of @xmath13 dividing @xmath43 , and so @xmath63 must divide  @xmath61 . since no prime divisor of @xmath57 can divide @xmath52 , it follows that  @xmath57 divides  @xmath61 .",
    "the number of elements of  @xmath55 with order  @xmath61 is  @xmath64 , and the number of generating cosets of  @xmath54 in @xmath55 is @xmath65 , and so the number of elements of order  @xmath61 in each such coset is @xmath66 .",
    "suppose that @xmath67 where  @xmath42 is a divisor of @xmath52 ; then since @xmath52 is coprime with @xmath57 we see that @xmath68 now the prime divisors of @xmath57 are precisely the prime divisors of @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath69 for any prime @xmath13 and positive integers @xmath70 , it follows that @xmath71 , which gives the required result .    now arguing similarly to the calculation of @xmath34 above",
    ", we find that @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath52 are as in lemma [ gcl ] .",
    "the condition that @xmath74 allows us to replace the condition that @xmath75 with the simpler condition that @xmath76 .",

    "[ e1 ] the linear equation @xmath83 is satisfied if @xmath31 for all @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    the equation becomes @xmath86 which is satisfied since @xmath87    we define @xmath88 to be the matrix with rows indexed by pairs from @xmath89 and columns by pairs from @xmath90 , such that each entry @xmath91 is the coefficient of  @xmath32 in  @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath92 to be the matrix whose entry @xmath93 is the coefficient of  @xmath32 in  @xmath37 .",
    "proposition [ e1 ] gives us a subspace of the kernel of @xmath94 whose dimension is the number of divisors @xmath95 of @xmath96 . to establish theorem  [ mt ]",

    ". then the product @xmath101 must be non - zero .",
    "we see from the definition ( [ l ] ) of @xmath34 that @xmath102 unless @xmath103 .",
    "so @xmath104 for all @xmath61 , and it clearly follows that @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , we see that @xmath102 unless @xmath30 and @xmath106 . now",
    "since we have shown that the values @xmath107 in our cycle are equal , it follows that we require @xmath108 for all @xmath61 , and hence that @xmath109 .",
    "we therefore see that @xmath110 for all @xmath61 , and so @xmath111 .",

    ", we shall establish @xmath95 as an upper bound for this dimension ; this will suffice to prove theorem [ mt ] .",
    "in fact we shall eventually establish the following result , which characterizes the matrix @xmath118 completely .",
    "[ rlinv ] @xmath118 is diagonalizable , and its characteristic polynomial is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the mbius function .",

    ". then if @xmath122 and @xmath123 are coprime integers , we may identify the set @xmath124 with the tensor product @xmath125 by identifying @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",

    "then an argument similar to that above shows that @xmath139    this tensor factorization transfers easily to the matrices @xmath88 and @xmath92 ; for the rest of this section we shall use the more explicit notation @xmath140 and @xmath141 for these matrices .",
    "then it is easy to see from the equations above that ( provided that rows and columns are suitably ordered ) , @xmath142 and it follows that @xmath143    the reduction of lemma [ rlinv ] to the case where @xmath96 is a prime power is now straightforward . for",
    "we notice that @xmath144 is diagonalizable if its tensor factors are ; its eigenvalues are the products of the eigenvalues of the tensor factors , with corresponding multiplicities .",
