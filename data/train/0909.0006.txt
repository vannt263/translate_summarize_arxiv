    "eclipsing systems are the gold standard by which theoretical models of stars , brown dwarfs , and extrasolar planets are tested , as they enable direct mass , radius , and temperature measurements . for example , mass and radius measurements of stars have provided critical tests of stellar interiors and key insights into stellar magnetism @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the discovery of transiting extrasolar planets has extended such fundamental measurements to the study of giant planets orbiting nearby stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the existence of such a population of short - period giant planets was originally a surprise , and the ongoing measurement of masses and radii for these planets continues to reveal remarkable diversity ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , spurring active research to characterize their atmospheres and understand their formation history .",
    "the first multi - epoch all - sky surveys , such as pan - starrs @xcite , skymapper @xcite , and the planned large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will soon open the door to the discovery of eclipsing systems different from those previously accessible .",
    "all - sky surveys contain the most comprehensive information for objects in the immediate solar neighborhood , which is populated predominately with m  dwarfs .",
    "historically , m  dwarfs have been neglected by surveys for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets .",
    "this is because m  dwarfs represent a tiny fraction of sources detected in magnitude - limited stellar variability surveys ( @xmath21:1000 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) constraints have limited radial velocity ( rv ) searches for extrasolar planets to monitor only the nearest m  dwarfs , which typically comprise @xmath210% of rv samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "consequently , there are only seven known eclipsing binaries with both component masses @xmath6  0.5   and only one extrasolar planet known to transit an m  dwarf .",
    "because of their small size ( 0.10.5  ) , m  dwarfs experience more extreme eclipses for a given size companion than solar - type stars . for example",
    ", the eclipse depth due to a transiting jupiter - size object is @xmath210% for a mid - m  dwarf ( @xmath20.3  ) , while it is an order of magnitude smaller ( @xmath21% ) for a solar - type star .",
    "such deep eclipses are in principle readily detectable in sparsely sampled light curves , where the interval between observing epochs is large compared to the periodic eclipse signal .",
    "the power of this approach has been demonstrated by the discovery of short - period m  dwarf eclipsing binaries in both the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) calibration fields @xcite and the sdss - ii supernova survey @xcite .",
    "pan - starrs-1 ( ps1 ) is the first of the large , multi - epoch surveys to be on sky , having begun extensive on - sky commissioning runs in spring 2009",
    ". it will conduct a number of different surveys , including a conventional , dedicated transit survey pointed at a fixed position on the sky ( pan - planets ) .",
    "we have instead focused on the 3@xmath0  survey ( described in detail in appendix  [ app : ps1 ] ) , the largest ps1 survey , which will image the entire 3@xmath0 steradians of sky visible from haleakala , on the island of maui , at 12  epochs spanning 3  years in each of 5  bandpasses .",
    "each ) at 72  epochs over 3  years in each of 5  bandpasses , with a @xmath24-day cadence designed to detect supernovae .",
    "since it covers only @xmath70.2% of the area of the 3@xmath0  survey , the medium deep survey is a negligible source of nearby , low - mass eclipsing systems . ]",
    "the cadence is designed to both detect asteroids and measure the parallaxes of nearby stars and is not specifically tailored to detect eclipsing binaries and transiting planets .",
    "however , its sparsely sampled light curves will be amenable to the detection of deep eclipses ( @xmath1  0.10  mag ) such as those produced by eclipsing binaries or jovian planets transiting m  dwarfs . the light curves for the hundreds of thousands of low - mass stars in the immediate solar neighborhood with parallaxes measured by ps1 will enable a novel , volume - limited variability survey of the entire northern sky .",
    "such an approach is conceptually similar to the mearth project @xcite , which is monitoring a carefully selected sample of 2000 nearby m  dwarfs for planetary transits and has already discovered and characterized one eclipsing binary @xcite .",
    "previous transit surveys have been magnitude - limited and have thus encountered two challenges : ( 1 ) overcoming a broad range of astrophysical false positives that mimic planetary transits and are more numerous by @xmath220:1 ; ( 2 ) obtaining follow - up observations on transit host stars that are fainter than those discovered by dedicated rv surveys .",
    "a volume - limited sample naturally reduces such rare astrophysical false positives and focuses on only the nearest , and thus brightest , stars in the sky .",
    "also , even if no events are detected , such a well - defined sample can enable meaningful statements about the underlying population of eclipsing systems , which can be challenging to quantify for magnitude - limited samples .",
    "however , sparsely sampled light curves are potentially more vulnerable to mundane false positives ( e.g. , due to star spots or photometric outliers ) since by definition they contain no information about the light curve shape during eclipse .",
    "previous authors have estimated the transit yield of pan - starrs , considering all stars detected within the magnitude limits of selected surveys . @xcite and @xcite used analytic relations to derive the number of transits for solar - type stars ( @xmath220 ) and m  dwarfs ( @xmath240 ) in the magnitude - limited sample of the ps1 medium deep survey .",
    "@xcite used a semi - analytic approach and , assuming that a large fraction ( 10% ) of m  dwarfs host a short - period ( 1  @xmath6  @xmath8  @xmath6  3  days ) neptune - mass planet , estimated that @xmath2300 transits in the 3@xmath0  survey and @xmath210 transits in the medium deep survey could be detected .",
    "neither of these results are directly comparable to our simulations , as we have used substantially different input assumptions , most importantly restricting ourselves to a volume - limited sample , and we also evaluate the detectability of such events in simulated survey light curves . in addition , we consider low - mass eclipsing binaries , which produce essentially the same eclipse signal in the sparsely sampled light curves as jupiters transiting m  dwarfs .",
    "such `` false positives '' in the search for planets would be interesting in their own right , given the small number of low - mass eclipsing binaries currently known .    in this paper",
    ", we predict the yield of eclipsing binaries and transiting jupiters in ps1 3@xmath0  survey data . using the best available empirical information , we have constructed a model of the solar neighborhood encompassing solar - type stars to the coldest known brown dwarfs , including a realistic binary population .",
    "we have developed a method for analytically predicting the planetary transit yield given an inventory of survey targets .",
    "we also constructed monte carlo simulations to predict the yield of both planets and eclipsing binaries and to characterize their host stars , while carefully considering the false positive rate due to star spots .",
    "the prospects of characterizing the candidate eclipsing systems found in sparsely sampled light curves with follow - up observations is discussed in detail , along with the impact of our input assumptions on the survey yield .",
    "we first created a model that describes the population of stellar and substellar objects within the solar neighborhood .",
    "these are the host stars for the transiting / eclipsing systems .",
    "the distance limit is set by the astrometric precision of the survey , since this determines the smallest parallaxes it will be able to measure .",
    "both ps1 and lsst have astrometric precision goals of 10  mas per epoch , which will enable s / n  @xmath9  10 parallax measurements for objects within 100  pc . since",
    "this distance is smaller than the scale length and height of the galactic disk ( 2600  pc and 300  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assumed that objects are uniformly distributed within this volume .",
    "we assigned the properties of these simulated objects as follows : ( 1 )  masses and ages were drawn from appropriate initial mass and birth rate functions ; ( 2 )  luminosities and radii were determined from evolutionary models ; ( 3 )  spectral types were assigned based on an empirical relation with luminosity , ( 4 )  optical and near - infrared colors and bolometric corrections were assigned based on empirical relations with spectral type ; ( 5 )  binary companions were assigned to an appropriate fraction of simulated objects , with the orbital separations and mass ratios randomly drawn from empirical distributions ; and ( 6 )  short - period ( @xmath8  @xmath6  11.5  days ) jupiter - like planets were assigned to an appropriate fraction of simulated objects , with orbital periods randomly drawn from an empirical distribution .",
    "the resulting population of low - mass stars ( @xmath10  @xmath6  1.0  ) and brown dwarfs is summarized in table  [ tbl:100pc ] .",
    "we list both the total number of objects within 100  pc ( over 4@xmath0 steradians ) and the objects expected to be within the magnitude limits and areal coverage of the ps1 3@xmath0  survey , which is described in appendix  [ app : ps1 ] .",
    "for example , our model predicts that a total of 94 m  dwarfs within 100  pc host planets with orbits aligned such that transits are observable from earth . of the 70 of these in the 3@xmath0",
    "steradians observable by ps1 , 56 are expected to be within the magnitude limits of the 3@xmath0  survey ( 14 are saturated ) . in our simulations , the number of actual transits observed by ps1 will be some subset of these 56 , depending on if transit events occur at the observation epochs .      as the starting point for our simulation",
    ", we drew masses and ages of objects from appropriate random distributions . for ages , we assumed a constant star formation rate over a period of 10  gyr . for the mass function , we used the best fit log - normal function derived by @xcite .",

    "we created a 2-dimensional array , uniformly gridded in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for each model - predicted property .",
    "then , for each simulated object , we bilinearly interpolated its model - predicted @xmath15 and @xmath16 from these arrays . because our simulated objects span a wide range of masses and temperatures ( from low - mass main - sequence stars to old brown dwarfs ) , different evolutionary models are appropriate for different simulated objects",

    "the last remaining property that we determined for simulated objects were their absolute magnitudes in the relevant optical and near - infrared bandpasses .",
    "we chose not to use the absolute magnitudes predicted by evolutionary models because it is well known that they do not accurately reproduce the colors of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "light curves were randomly drawn for every survey star .",
    "the flux of each star was determined from its magnitude in the ps1 bandpasses and the zero points derived in appendix  [ app : ps1 ] .",

    "eclipse false positives due to star spots , we added sinusoidal variability to a fraction of the light curves .",
    "since m dwarfs are the primary source of detected eclipsing systems and can potentially have large amplitude variability due to spots , we only added simulated variability to m  dwarfs .",
    "we used the best available information on such periodic variability from @xcite , who found a median variability amplitude of 0.014  mag ( 0.0050.02  mag observed range ) in their @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 bands for 21@xmath4311% of m  dwarfs . in appendix",
    "[ app : alg ] , we discuss the issue of false positives in more detail , considering other cases beyond our simple m  dwarf spot model .",
    "we ran separate simulations for planets and binary companions ( i.e. , we did not consider transiting planets in double star systems ) and we used the `` s / n model '' ( algorithm 3 in appendix  [ app : alg ] ) in a blind search of the simulated light curves for eclipse events .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tbl : sim - res ] , where we have again treated bandpasses separately , as in our semi - analytic approach .",

    "7 is an unrealistically optimistic threshold , this does not sensitively impact the planet or eclipsing binary yield . figures  [ fig : sim - plnt ] and [ fig : sim - comp ] show that the median s / n of detected transits and eclipses are about 15 and 20 , respectively . ] summing the detections in individual bandpasses , the survey yield for planets is in good agreement with the results from the semi - analytic approach ( both find 16 transits ) .",
    "we also found that limb - darkened eclipse curves gave the same numbers to within @xmath210% as uniform disk illumination , and thus in table  [ tbl : sim - res ] we only quote the uniform disk results as these are directly comparable to the semi - analytic results .    for the ps1 3@xmath0  survey , the monte carlo simulations predict that about 16 transits for 13 jupiters orbiting m  dwarfs are detectable , so about three transits are detected in two different bandpasses over the course of the survey .",
    "however , the vast majority of detected flux dips are predicted to be due to eclipsing binaries : 570 eclipses for 260 eclipsing binaries .",
    "about 40% of these binaries are detected in only one bandpass , about 25% are detected in two , and about 15%/10%/10% are detected in 3/4/5 bands . because different bandpasses are not observed simultaneously , such multi - band detections can not be used to measure the color in and out of eclipse , which could help distinguish planets from stellar companions .",

    "our simulations predict @xmath210 eclipsing binaries with a substellar secondary , and these would be important discoveries as there are currently no known field brown dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and therefore no direct measurements of the radii of brown dwarfs .",
    "different bandpasses contribute different numbers of eclipsing binaries by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "for example , the @xmath26 band contributes about twice as many eclipses as the @xmath72 or @xmath59 bands .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that m  dwarfs have red optical colors and the detection volume of mid - m  dwarfs within 100  pc is most strongly limited by saturation .",
    "thus , the effective volume of @xmath26 band is @xmath22 larger than @xmath72 or @xmath59 bands because saturation affects @xmath26 band less ( see figure  [ fig : survey - limits ] in appendix  [ app : ps1 ] ) .",

    "thus , m  dwarfs may have a systematically different period at which planets terminate their migration . given their lower energy output , the inner disk edge for m  dwarfs should be closer to the star , which would result in a shorter pile - up period and an increase in the number of detected transits .",
    "for example , if the inner disk edge occurs at a fixed temperature , where the gas becomes ionized @xcite and/or dust sublimates @xcite , its distance from the star will scale as @xmath89 . during pre",

    "because of the flat mass  radius relation for brown dwarfs , substellar eclipsing binaries should be among the easiest eclipsing systems to detect : equal radii imply eclipse depths of 50100% ( depending on the flux ratio ) over a wide range of mass ratios . *",

    "the seeing has a significant impact on the saturation limits , and such a change would make these less restrictive by 0.4  mag .",
    "this would make more of the earlier type and/or nearer m  dwarfs accessible to the 3@xmath0  survey , increasing the number of detectable transiting planets and eclipsing binaries .",
    "for example , table  [ tbl:100pc ] shows that 22% of m  dwarfs within 100  pc are saturated assuming 08 seeing , and this would change to 15% for 10 seeing .",
    "thus , more m  dwarfs would be unsaturated in more bandpasses .",
    "eclipse events are only expected to be observed once , or possibly twice , per star over the entire course of the ps1 3@xmath0 survey .",
    "this has two consequences : ( 1 ) the eclipse signatures of transiting planets and eclipsing binaries will be indistinguishable from each other in ps1 data ; and ( 2 ) detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations will be required to characterize all systems . since eclipsing binaries",

    "however , we conservatively assume that robust discrimination will only be possible with photometric and/or spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "transiting planets may be distinguished from binaries either by their much lower rv semi - amplitude ( via spectroscopic follow - up ) or by the shape of the light curve and lack of a secondary eclipse ( via photometric follow - up ) . with unknown ephemerides , rv measurements from at least two , possibly three , epochs would be needed to identify eclipsing binaries .",
    "assuming 20 pairs of rv measurements could be obtained per night , at least 14 nights would be required to follow - up all 273 candidates .",

    "photometric follow - up would be most efficiently broken into two campaigns : first , to determine rough ephemerides ( transit times and periods ) ; second , to measure higher precision and cadence light curves during transit . the initial campaign would require regular monitoring every eclipse half - interval ( 15 minutes ) over at most two full periods ( 0.4  days for binaries ; 3  days for planets ) , in order to catch two eclipses . assuming 5 minutes per observation ( slewing and integration time )",
    ", this amounts to 6.4  hours per binary and 48 hours per planet , for a total of 230 nights . with ephemerides in hand ,",
    "detailed light curves can then be obtained . in order to measure both the primary and secondary",
    "eclipses of binaries , at least two such light curves are required , so this second phase would cost @xmath72  hours per object , for a total of 55 nights .",

    "however , particularly for the initial campaign of 230 nights , this cost could be distributed among several small telescopes , possibly even in collaboration with amateur astronomers  a strategy employed with success by the xo transit survey @xcite and the microfun ] consortium .",
    "this is possible because eclipsing systems discovered in the 3@xmath0 survey would be relatively bright : ps1 achieves a s / n  @xmath1  100 in 30  s with a 1.8-m telescope , so @xmath730  cm apertures should be able to achieve a photometric precision of @xmath72% in just a few minutes .    to summarize the initial follow - up requirements , either an rv campaign costing at least 14 nights on 8-m class telescopes or a photometric campaign costing 285/@xmath98 nights on @xmath98 small - aperture ( @xmath1  30  cm ) telescopes is needed to separate all the transiting planets from the 20:1 more numerous eclipsing binaries .",

    "in fact , only a few of these systems have parameters determined to high precision because of their apparent faintness , whereas eclipsing binaries discovered in a volume - limited sample by ps1 would naturally include some of the brightest eclipsing binaries in the sky .",
    "the number of detectable substellar eclipsing binaries is uncertain ( ranging from none to @xmath23 for the 3@xmath0  survey ) due to poor observational constraints on substellar regime of the initial mass function and on the properties of brown dwarf binaries at such small orbital separations .",
    "the mass ratio distribution for tight m  dwarf binaries is nearly as uncertain , but using the best available data our simulations predict that dozens of brown dwarfs are potentially detectable in eclipsing binaries with m  dwarfs . such systems would enable radius measurements of field brown dwarfs for the first time , providing sorely needed tests of substellar evolutionary models .",
    "this is the first detailed analysis of the expected yield of eclipsing systems from pan - starrs , revealing its potential to discover systems that have largely eluded previous surveys .",
    "the extensive set of tools we have developed for our simulations can be readily applied to other sparsely sampled , multi - epoch all - sky surveys planned for the coming decade .",
    "surveys such as lsst are anticipated to far exceed the revolutionary surveys of the present by imaging the whole sky deeper and more often , opening the door to intrinsically fainter and rarer eclipsing systems .",
    "we have benefited from conversations with eugene magnier about the ps1 surveys , j. patrick henry and thierry forveille about statistics , eric hilton about m  dwarf variability and flares , and adam kraus about low - mass binaries .",

    "in the following , we describe the attributes of the ps1 photometric system and the 3@xmath0 and medium deep surveys .",
    "ps1 is a 1.8-m telescope located on haleakala on the island of maui , and has an effective collecting area of 1.73  m@xmath101 , after accounting for obscuration and diffraction losses .",
    "it is equipped with the gigapixel camera # 1 ( gpc1 ) , comprising 60 orthogonal transfer array ( ota ) chips , each 4k@xmath34k pixels , sampling a circular field - of - view 3  in diameter .",
    "gpc1 has a nominal pixel scale of 026  pixel@xmath100 , read noise ( @xmath102 ) of 5  @xmath103  pixel@xmath100 , and gain of 1  @xmath103  dn@xmath100 @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the best possible photometric precision for ps1 is 0.01  mag , i.e. , a systematic noise floor of ( s / n)@xmath54  =  100 in the photometry .",
    "the ps1 photometric system is largely patterned after the sdss photometric system @xcite , but the ps1 detectors are much more red - sensitive so low - mass stars and brown dwarfs will have somewhat different colors in the ps1 photometric system than in sdss .",
    "the total predicted system throughput in each of the five ps1 bandpasses ( @xmath104 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : ps1-filt ] along with the sdss bandpasses .",
    "compared to sdss , ps1 has significantly increased sensitivity at @xmath59-band , along with an additional bandpass ( @xmath28 ) centered at 0.98  .",
    "we have computed the ab system zero points of these bandpasses , as well as the expected sky flux in each filter .",
    "these quantities are listed in table  [ tbl : ps1-filt ] .    for our simulations",
    ", we drew on the extensive body of optical photometry from sdss for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have derived conversions from the sdss to the ps1 photometric systems as a function of spectral type by computing synthetic photometry from publicly available spectra .",
    "we used the averaged stellar spectra of g0m6 dwarfs from @xcite , which has essentially complete wavelength coverage at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we used optical spectra retrieved from link:\\texttt{dwarfarchives.org}[\\texttt\\{dwarfarchives.org } ] for k5m9 dwarfs , most of which are either unpublished or are from @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "we used flux - calibrated spectra of m , l , and t dwarfs both from s.  k.  leggett s spectral library , ] which comprise a variety of published spectra , and from the irtf / spex spectral library ( * ? ? ?",
    "* j.  t.  rayner et al .",
    "2009 , submitted ) . ]",
    "our derived sdss - to - ps1 photometric conversions are shown in figure  [ fig : phot - conv ] , along with polynomial fits as a function of spectral type ( coefficients given in table  [ tbl : phot - conv ] ) .",
    "these conversions reflect how the flux ratio between an object of a given spectral type and a zero - magnitude source differs from sdss to ps1 . by definition ,",
    "the ab zero - magnitude source is blue ( @xmath105 ) , while m , l , and t dwarfs are red at optical wavelengths .",
    "thus , ps1 filters that are somewhat redder than their sdss counterparts ( like @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) gain object flux without as much change in the zero - magnitude flux , leading to brighter ps1 magnitudes of up to 0.3  mag for the reddest objects .",
    "the ps1 @xmath72 band is very similar to sdss , resulting in @xmath106  0.1  mag differences in zero point .",
    "band synthetic photometry does not accurately reproduce details in the @xmath72 band photometric conversion as a function of spectral type .",
    "however , the discrepancies between our fit and the actual photometry are @xmath106  0.06  mag , and thus have an insignificant impact on our results . ]",
    "the biggest photometric conversion factor is for the @xmath59 band , which is understandable since for sdss this is a longpass filter but for ps1 it has well defined cut - on and cut - off wavelengths .",
    "the pan - starrs-1 telescope will be used to conduct several surveys , and the largest two of these are the 3@xmath0  survey and the medium deep survey , nominally using 56% and 25% of the available observing time , respectively . at the time of writing , the exact survey strategies to be employed are somewhat uncertain , pending on - sky tests of ps1 performance . for our simulations , we have assumed the surveys will be conducted as conceived in the design reference mission document .",
    "the cadence employed by the 3@xmath0  survey is planned to be optimized for parallax measurements of nearby low - mass objects , with redder bands sampling epochs nearer the maximum parallax factor .",
    "thus , observations in each of the five bandpasses will be spread out over each observing season .",
    "also , each observation is expected to consist of a pair of images taken in the same bandpass within 3060  minutes of each other , in order to identify asteroids , and we count these as separate epochs .",
    "the expected medium deep survey cadence is to simply rotate through the five filters every four days .",
    "tables  [ tbl:3pi ] and [ tbl : m - d ] summarize the relevant information for each survey , as well as detection and saturation limits that we derived . for the detection limits , we have assumed an aperture that is 1 fwhm in diameter , which for a 2-dimensional gaussian collects 50% of the source flux . we also tabulate the earliest spectral type that is unsaturated at 100  pc , which is the limiting distance at which ps1 is able to measure s / n  =  10 parallaxes . unless the seeing is worse than the nominal 08 ( see section  [ sec : assump ] ) , objects earlier than this will not have measurable parallaxes because they will be saturated . loss of time due to weather has been accounted for in the survey parameters .    using the survey information given in tables  [ tbl:3pi ] and [ tbl : m - d ] and the empirical relations in section  [ sec : sim - star ] , we have derived detection limits as a function of spectral type for each ps1 bandpass .",
    "figure  [ fig : survey - limits ] shows the distances at which objects of a given spectral type are expected to reach the detection threshold ( s /",
    "n  =  5 ) , as well as the distances within which they are so bright that they will be saturated .",
    "because the color selection of nearby stars may benefit from , or require , the use of near - infrared photometry , we also show the distance limit at which 2mass is 99% complete in @xmath107 band ( @xmath107  @xmath6  15.8  mag ) .",
    "we chose not to show the @xmath17-band limit for simplicity , although it is very similar to the @xmath107-band limit ( except for t dwarfs ) due to the trade off between a brighter sky background but more object flux for red objects at @xmath17 band .",
    "we have investigated algorithms for detecting eclipse signatures in sparsely sampled light curves , such as those generated by upcoming multi - epoch all - sky surveys .",
    "this problem is inherently different from searching for a low - amplitude periodic signal in a densely sampled light curve , for which robust methods have been developed for current planetary transit surveys .",
    "rather , a sparsely sampled light curve will likely only catch one eclipse event at a single epoch , so we are interested in identifying a single discrepant point for an otherwise constant star .",
    "below we describe three algorithms for identifying such eclipses and then assess their detection limits and vulnerability to false positives .    1 .   _",
    "@xmath108  null test_. the @xmath108 of a light curve may be reliably computed when measurement errors are well determined : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the counts ( dn ) and uncertainty at each light curve point , and @xmath112 is the weighted average of the light curve .",
    "any deviation from a constant light curve will increase the value of @xmath108 .",
    "for example , an increase in @xmath108 could signify a single very discrepant point ( e.g. , a deep eclipse ) or variability throughout the light curve .",
    "the value of @xmath108 gives the confidence interval for the null hypothesis that the flux from the star is constant .",
    "@xmath113  index_. @xcite introduced an eclipse detection statistic ( @xmath113 ) which combines the @xmath108 values of different portions of the light curve to give an index which is roughly equivalent to the ( s / n)@xmath114 of the detection .",
    "we adopt the form of the @xmath113 index as modified by @xcite , which was used to assess the presence of eclipses and flares in sparsely sampled light curves in sdss stripe 82 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the same as equation  [ eqn : chi2 ] , @xmath117 is computed excluding the minimum point in the light curve , and @xmath118 is the number of degrees of freedom of @xmath116 ( i.e. , @xmath119 for a light curve with @xmath50 points ) .",
    "the @xmath113 index is designed to be more robust against false positives due to variability than the @xmath108 null tests , since @xmath113 is only large when the out - of - transit portion of the light curve is nearly constant ( small @xmath120 ) . to determine whether an eclipse was detected ,",
    "a threshold value of @xmath113 must be chosen ( e.g. , a @xmath113 value of 100 corresponds to a s / n of @xmath210 ) .",
    "3 .   _ s / n model_. the s / n of a candidate eclipse event can be computed directly from the light curve and its errors : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the counts ( dn ) and error at light curve s minimum point , @xmath124 is the mean of the remaining points , and @xmath125 is the standard error of the mean . in our s / n model , @xmath125 and @xmath123 are limited by the systematic noise floor ( s / n@xmath54  =  100 for ps1 ) .",
    "for example , the uncertainty in the out - of - transit counts ( @xmath125 ) is not allowed to be smaller than @xmath124/(s / n@xmath54 ) .",
    "the eclipse s / n computed using this model will be small for a constant light curve and large when the minimum point is very different from the remaining points .",
    "a threshold s / n must be chosen to determine whether an eclipse was detected .",
    "the ideal eclipse detection algorithm is sensitive to the smallest flux diminutions , while also being robust against false positives . in figure",
    "[ fig : alg - mindepth ] , we show the minimum detectable eclipse depths of the various algorithms for a source with a photometric s / n of 100 ( i.e. , at the photometric error floor of ps1 ) . as points are added to the light curve , the sensitivity of the algorithms change in different ways . for the @xmath113 index ,",
    "the sensitivity monotonically improves , while for the @xmath108 null test the sensitivity actually gets worse .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that by adding more constant flux points to the light curve , the significance of the single discrepant point is decreased compared to the null hypothesis of constant flux .",
    "the s / n model gives essentially the same sensitivity for any light curve because in this case we have considered a source whose photometric errors are already at the noise floor ; thus , adding more points does not reduce the noise . in figure",
    "[ fig : alg - mindepth ] , we have chosen a @xmath113 threshold of 150 in order to roughly match the sensitivity of the s / n model threshold of 10 and @xmath108 null test confidence limit of 10@xmath126 .",
    "of course , the exact choice of the detection threshold should be based on the expected number of false positives .    in practice ,",
    "the number of false positives resulting from different detection algorithms depends on the particular survey strategy and the nature of the contaminating sources . in our simulations",
    ", we have found that ps1 will be particularly sensitive to transiting jupiters around m  dwarfs .",
    "a large fraction of m  dwarfs are chromospherically active ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus they are expected to show photometric variability due to spots , making this one of the most likely sources of false positive eclipse detections in sparsely sampled data . in figure",
    "[ fig : alg - false - pos ] , we show contours of the false positive fraction due to spots for the 3@xmath0  survey s 12-point light curves .",
    "the variability due to spots is assumed to be sinusoidal , and we have considered a range of amplitudes , properly accounting for the fact that a sine curve has an rms of @xmath127 .",
    "we adopt the best available estimate of variability among m  dwarfs from @xcite who found a median variability amplitude of 0.014  mag ( 0.0050.02  mag observed range ) for 21@xmath4311% of m  dwarfs .",
    "the contours in figure  [ fig : alg - false - pos ] show the fraction of false positives over a range of parameter space that covers low to high amplitude variability and rare to common occurence fractions of variability .    for the 3@xmath0  survey , figure  [ fig : alg - false - pos ] shows that the @xmath108 null test is vulnerable to false positives over a broader range of variability parameter space than the other algorithms .",
    "this is intuitively expected as it is sensitive to any deviations from a constant light curve , not just eclipses .",
    "the @xmath113 index and s / n model yield false positives over about the same amount of parameter space , but in different regions .",
    "the s / n model is vulnerable to very rare , highly variable objects .",
    "for example , if 1 in 10@xmath128 m  dwarfs are variable at the 0.10  mag level , this would result in an unmanageable false positive fraction of @xmath210@xmath12 .",
    "such a population could easily have been missed by the best available variability surveys , which have targeted only a few dozen m  dwarfs . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath113 index is vulnerable to relatively common objects with a lower level of variability .",
    "we also experimented with arbitrarily increasing the number of light curve points and found the most drastic improvement for the @xmath113 index which for light curves with @xmath9  15  points had a false positive rate @xmath6  10@xmath129 over the entire variability parameter space in figure  [ fig : alg - false - pos ] .",
    "the improvement for the s / n model was less extreme , with contours changing by only 0.02  mag for 72-point light curves , and the @xmath108 null test actually worsened .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated three algorithms for eclipse detection in sparsely sampled light curves with very few ( @xmath210 ) epochs .",
    "we have paid particular attention to possible contamination from variability due to star spots , which is the most likely source of eclipse false positives in such data for m  dwarfs .",
    "all algorithms achieve similar eclipse depth sensitivities for a given confidence interval ( figure  [ fig : alg - mindepth ] ) .",
    "we found that the @xmath108 null test is a good general tool for identifying deviations from a constant light curve , but because of this it has the highest false positive rate .",
    "the @xmath113 index and s / n model are vulnerable to different source populations of false positives ( e.g. , rare , highly variable objects ) , which are largely unprobed by current variability surveys .",
    "thus , it is impossible to predict the better algorithm for robustly detecting transits in advance of actual survey data .",
    "in fact , using _ both _",
    "algorithms simultaneously may prove to be the best strategy for eliminating false positives .",
    "we emphasize that the proper eclipse detection algorithm depends not only on the underlying source of false positives , but also on the particular survey strategy .",
    "for example , in the ps1 3@xmath0  survey observation epochs will actually be obtained in pairs separated by 3060  minutes for the purpose of asteroid detection .",
    "this may help distinguish spots from true eclipse events since stellar rotation for m  dwarfs occurs over much longer time scales , and thus spots would cause a flux dip in both images in the pair , whereas a transit would only be detected in one ( e.g. , see the discussion on paired observations by * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the survey will measure parallaxes for the @xmath24@xmath310@xmath4  stars within 100  pc which will enable a volume - limited eclipse search , reducing the number of astrophysical false positives compared to previous magnitude - limited searches . using the best available empirical data , we constructed a model of the extended solar neighborhood that includes stars , brown dwarfs , and a realistic binary population . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the yield of deeply eclipsing systems using both a semi - analytic and a full monte carlo approach . </S>",
    "<S> we examined statistical tests for detecting single - epoch eclipses in sparsely sampled data and assessed their vulnerability to false positives due to stellar variability . assuming a short - period planet frequency of 0.5% for m  dwarfs , our simulations predict that about a dozen transiting jupiters around low - mass stars ( @xmath5  @xmath6  0.3  ) within 100  pc are potentially detectable in the ps1 3@xmath0  survey , along with @xmath2300 low - mass eclipsing binaries ( both component masses @xmath6  0.5  ) , including @xmath210 eclipsing field brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> extensive follow - up observations would be required to characterize these candidate eclipsing systems , thereby enabling comprehensive tests of structural models and novel insights into the planetary architecture of low - mass stars . </S>"
