    "one of the outstanding challenges facing quantum information proposals based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) is the development of a method for transferring photons between different cavities @xcite . with a robust photon transfer method ,",
    "a cavity containing one or more atoms can act as a single node in a quantum network made up of many such cavities connected by optical fibres @xcite .",
    "quantum networks provide a way to solve the problem of scalability in quantum information processing , scalability being one of the divincenzo criteria for the realization of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "a scheme for the efficient transfer of photons between distant atoms has been put forward by cirac _",
    "et al . _",
    "they considered what happens when a photon wave packet is emitted by an atom into a high - q optical cavity which is connected , via an optical fibre , to a second cavity containing a second atom .",
    "a generic wave packet reflects from the highly reflective mirror of the second cavity , thus leaving the wave packet to slosh around inside the cavity - fibre system",
    ". however , cirac _ et al . _",
    "realized that if the emitted wave packet was time - symmetric then it could be absorbed by the second atom with high efficiency .",
    "the coherent exchange of photons between an atom and a cavity mode can be controlled by time - dependent laser pulses applied through the side of a cavity @xcite , and this allows the temporal shape of the wave packet to be controlled .",
    "a different approach has been suggested by pellizari @xcite . in analogy with",
    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , which uses two or more control lasers to transfer an atom between two internal states via an intermediate state which is never populated , pellizari proposed that laser pulses applied to the two atoms could be used to control the transfer of photons between them along the fibre , the role of the intermediate state being played by the cavity and fibre photon states .",
    "the appeal of an adiabatic passage method lies in the fact that the details of the pulse shape and timing are not important .",
    "furthermore , because the cavity and fibre modes are only virtually populated , the scheme is insensitive to cavity and fibre losses .",
    "inspired by @xcite , the theory of adiabatic passage of photons between two atoms via cavities and optical fibres has been developed by a number of groups , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we also note that the basic concept of stirap has also been discussed in the context of the adiabatic passage of matter waves , such as atoms and electrons , where it is referred to as coherent tunneling adiabatic passage ( ctap ) .",
    "for example , references @xcite and @xcite consider the adiabatic transfer of ultracold atoms along a chain of traps .",
    "is the difference in length between the two cavities . ]    in this paper we consider the adiabatic transfer of light between two coupled cavities by changing their lengths .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by translating the cavity mirrors using piezo - electric actuators ( motors ) .",
    "alternatively , if the cavity takes the form of a dielectric waveguide the mirror positions can remain fixed but the optical length of the cavities can be controlled by modulating the refractive index @xcite .",
    "the specific model system we choose to illustrate the adiabatic transfer process in either of these experimental scenarios is a double cavity in one dimension as depicted in figure [ fig : cavitysetup ] .",
    "changing the lengths of the two cavities changes the structure of the electromagnetic modes in such a way that a mode which is initially localized in one cavity can be smoothly transferred into the other cavity .",
    "our study of the spatial adiabatic passage of light is in the same spirit as pelizzari s , although we shall not consider the atoms , but focus instead on the global normal modes of maxwell s equations whose frequencies form a net of avoided crossings as a function of mirror displacement",
    ". it would be straightforward to introduce atoms into the scheme : for certain mirror displacements a quasi - resonant global light mode can be strongly localized in one of the cavities , and so a photon emitted by an atom in that cavity will find itself in that chosen mode . this global mode",
    "is then transferred to the other cavity , where the other atom can interact with the photon with high efficiency . on the other hand ,",
    "if during the emission the mirror is not at a position which localizes the relevant global mode in the first cavity , then the photon will be placed into a superposition of global modes and the resulting time - dependence of the superposition leads to an oscillation of the photon back and forth between the two cavities , thereby lowering the transfer efficiency to the other atom and/or introducing the necessity for good timing .    because our model is simple , it allows a straightforward analysis of the conditions for adiabatic transfer , and a number of analytic results can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , the yale opto - mechanical group have realized a double cavity @xcite which is close to that considered by us here .",
    "their experimental setup consists of an optical cavity divided in half by a thin silicon membrane . when the cavity is driven through an end mirror by an external laser , the membrane vibrates due to radiation pressure .",
    "indeed , a recent theoretical paper @xcite , discusses photon shuttling between the two halves of the cavity , in close correspondence to what we will consider here .",
    "other theoretical studies of this system treat it as a photonic version of the josephson junction @xcite .",
    "the important difference between our paper and previous optomechanical studies is that we propose to control the motion of mirror from outside rather than allowing it to move under the action of radiation pressure .",
    "the problem of a cavity with moving mirrors is also of general interest from the point of view of studying cqed with time - dependent boundary conditions .",
    "this is an interesting generalization of cqed with many potential applications , including the field of opto - mechanics .",
    "other related applications include the possibility of modifying the decay rate of light from a cavity by modulating the position of the mirrors in time @xcite , and if the mirrors accelerate very rapidly , photon pair production @xcite .",
    "observations of this dynamical casimir effect have recently been reported in microwave cavities @xcite . also on the experimental side ,",
    "advances in the ultrafast manipulation of the refractive index of silicon microcavities ( which is equivalent to changing the cavity s length ) have been used to demonstrate transitions between modes @xcite . when the refractive index is changed more slowly , the light adiabatically follows the modes , leading to a change in its color @xcite .",
    "the programme we follow in this paper is to treat cavity electrodynamics with time - dependent boundary conditions from first principles , by starting with maxwell s wave equation . from this",
    "we derive an effective ` hamiltonian ' which can be used for the purposes of first - order time propagation .",
    "more precisely , by making an approximation analogous to the paraxial approximation familiar from optics , but in time rather than space , we find that the maxwell wave equation reduces to an equation of motion for the classical maxwell field that is first order in time and has a mathematical resemblance to the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "( for a different approach to mapping the maxwell wave equation onto the schrdinger equation see @xcite ) . under certain conditions",
    "we are therefore able to apply landau - zener theory @xcite , familiar from non - relativistic quantum mechanics , to the calculation of the coupling between classical maxwell modes induced by changing the lengths of the cavities .",
    "we emphasize that our method is different from one in which the hamiltonian obtained from the _ static _ problem is used for time propagation .",
    "in particular , we show that there are higher order terms which provide significant corrections to the latter scheme @xcite .",
    "the idea of using the landau - zener model to understand time - dependent processes in optics is not new .",
    "for example , the experiment reported in @xcite studied the time evolution of light in cavity where an electo - optic modulator was used to couple the two polarization states of a single longitudinal mode .",
    "a second electo - optic modulator was used to vary the energy separation between two polarization states : varying this separation linearly in time whilst maintaining a constant coupling corresponds to the landau - zener model .",
    "another system which is useful for studying the analogies between optical and quantum dynamics is provided by evanescently coupled waveguides , where the coupling between the waveguides changes with distance along the waveguide @xcite .",
    "this system has been studied experimentally by a number of groups and various optical analogues to quantum phenomena have been observed , including zener tunneling @xcite , adiabatic evolution @xcite , and dynamical localization @xcite .",
    "there have also been numerous studies of the conditions necessary for adiabaticity in cqed when atoms are included , see , for example , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of a two - level system coupled to a cavity field is studied in the situation where the separation between the two energy levels is varied linearly in time , and in @xcite the principle of stirap is applied to a two - mode jaynes - cummings model with degenerate mode frequencies , with the aim of adiabatically transferring photons between modes .",
    "we show in this paper that the application of the landau - zener model to the problem of a double cavity with changing cavity lengths illustrates in a simple fashion some of the similarities and differences between classical electrodynamics obeying maxwell s equations and quantum mechanics obeying schrdinger s equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : deltafunctionmirrormodel ] we introduce a simple model for the spatial dependence of the dielectric permittivity function inside a double cavity .",
    "this model treats the central mirror as a dirac @xmath0-function which facilitates analytic calculations later in the paper . in section [ sec : maxwelleqns ] we find the global static solutions ( normal modes ) of maxwell s wave equation subject to this dielectric function . in section [",
    "sec : transferratio ] we use these solutions to compute the transfer ratio , i.e.  the degree to which the light can be localized on one side of the central mirror or the other depending on mirror position . in section",
    "[ sec : lz ] we introduce time - dependence by relating the problem of the transfer of light in a double cavity with a moving mirror to the well known landau - zener problem in quantum mechanics . in order to apply the results from the landau - zener problem we need to map the maxwell wave equation , which is second order in time , onto the schrdinger wave equation , which is first order in time , and this is accomplished in section [ sec : frommaxwelltoschrodinger ] .",
    "the electric field is quantized in section [ sec : quantization ] , and in section [ sec : regimes ] we examine the regimes of validity of the mapping onto the schrdinger wave equation .",
    "the @xmath0-function mirror model is compared to a more realistic model for a mirror in section [ sec : finitewidthmirror ] , and in section [ sec : experimentalfeasibility ] we discuss the experimental feasibility .",

    "consider a double cavity formed from two end mirrors plus a common mirror located between them , as shown figure [ fig : cavitysetup ] .",
    "we assume that the end mirrors are much more reflective than the central mirror and that the loss of light from the double cavity is negligible during the time taken for the light to be transferred from one side to the other .",
    "the stringent conditions this places on an experiment will be examined in section [ sec : experimentalfeasibility ] .",
    "as mentioned above , our proposed setup is motivated by remarkable developments in opto - mechanics @xcite .",
    "the additional feature we require here is that the common mirror be externally controlled , i.e.  can be moved along the cavity axis .",
    "a simple theoretical model describing a double cavity has been given in a classic paper by lang , scully and lamb @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of solving maxwell s wave equation in the double cavity , they treated the end mirrors as perfect reflectors and the central mirror as a thin slab of dielectric material which is modelled by a dirac @xmath0-function spatial profile .",
    "the double cavity model is thereby encoded in a dielectric permittivity function of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the positions of the end mirrors .",
    "@xmath6 is a parameter which determines the reflectivity of the common mirror , see the appendices for more details .",
    "the total length of the double cavity is @xmath7 , and we also define the difference between the lengths of the two cavities to be @xmath8 , which is also twice the displacement of the common mirror from the center of the whole cavity .    maxwell s wave equation for the electric field @xmath9 in the double cavity is @xmath10 we use this @xmath0-mirror model for the bulk of this paper because its simplicity facilitates analytic results .",
    "however , in section [ sec : finitewidthmirror ] we compare the results of the @xmath0-mirror model to the more realistic case of a mirror of finite width",
    ".    note that for mathematical convenience we have chosen a coordinate system in eq .",
    "( [ perm ] ) where the common mirror is always located at @xmath11 .",
    "however , we do not intend to attach any physical significance to this choice : physically , one can either take the view that the common mirror has a fixed position and it is the two end mirrors that are displaced , or vice versa .",
    "the latter view corresponds to an experimental situation , such as that described in @xcite and @xcite , where a common membrane is displaced , whilst the former view is closer in spirit to an experiment in which the position of the common mirror is held fixed , but the refractive index of the two cavities is modulated @xcite , see appendix [ sec : appendix2b ] for more details . in sections [ sec : lz ] and [ sec : frommaxwelltoschrodinger ] we treat the case of moving mirrors : providing the mirrors are moving at constant velocities , it is physically equivalent to imagine either translating the end mirrors or the common mirror because these two situations simply correspond to two different inertial frames",

    "the larger @xmath6 is , the stronger this localization becomes ( and the more the avoided crossings close up ) .",
    "the general procedure for the adiabatic transfer of a light mode from one side of the double cavity to the other is now apparent : if the common mirror position is initially set to one side of an avoided crossing ( the optimal position is roughly halfway to the next avoided crossing ",
    "see section [ sec : transferratio ] ) then the localized and global modes approximately coincide and the mode is localized on one side on the common mirror . if the mirror is now slowly translated to the equivalent point on the other side of the avoided crossing , the system will follow the global curve on which it began . on the opposite side of the avoided crossing this global mode",
    "approximately coincides with the localized mode on the other side of the common mirror .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in figure [ fig : modeplotnew ] .",
    "it is notable that the wave number of the degenerate localized solutions at @xmath30 coincides exactly with the lower branch of the corresponding global solutions at the avoided crossing , rather than lying halfway between the two global branches .",
    "this is because the lower global branch corresponds to an odd solution in the double cavity .",
    "odd solutions have a node at the @xmath0-mirror and hence do not see the mirror at all .",
    "connoisseurs of the related problem of the double well potential in quantum mechanics will immediately observe that this is the reverse of the situation found there , where the lower branch is due to the even global solution .",
    "this reversal of the ordering of the solutions with respect to the double well problem in quantum mechanics is due to the fact that for light propagating in 1d there can be no evanescent waves ( assuming the refractive index is @xmath50 and there is no absorption ) and so there can be no tunnelling barriers , only wells .",
    "the double cavity system for classical light waves is actually equivalent to a quantum reflection problem in quantum mechanics .",

    "for example , in the key eqns ( [ even approx2 ] ) , ( [ odd approx2 ] ) , ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ delta approx ] ) , the speed of light @xmath383 in needs to be replaced by the speed @xmath384 in the guide .",
    "the solution of the transcendental equation ( [ transcendental2 ] ) allows us to construct global modes which exist throughout the double cavity .",
    "the global modes are the eigenvectors of the time - independent maxwell wave equation in the double cavity and need to be recalculated for each value of the difference between the cavity lengths @xmath31 .",
    "these modes give the so - called adiabatic basis as specified by eqns ( [ eq : e+=keven ] ) and ( [ eq : e-=kodd ] ) , and we denote this basis by @xmath385 and @xmath386 .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec : lz ] , it is convenient to be able to express the double cavity problem in a basis which we refer to as the `` lz diabatic basis '' , or the `` diabatic basis '' for short . we _",
    "define _ the diabatic basis as the basis in which solutions to the time - independent maxwell / schrdinger wave equation can be expressed in the form given by the lz hamiltonian matrix ( [ lz - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "in other words , the diabatic energies @xmath91 and eigenvectors are those found from the lz hamiltonian when @xmath387 .",
    "we shall denote the diabatic basis vectors @xmath388 and @xmath109 .    for a @xmath0-function mirror the diabatic basis does not in general coincide with the entirely localized basis , as defined by the wave numbers @xmath389 found when @xmath22 .",
    "this can easily be seen by comparing the lz hamiltonian ( [ lz - hamiltonian ] ) , for which the diabatic energies cross exactly halfway between the two adiabatic solutions , to the entirely localized solutions which cross on the lower adiabatic curve ( see figure [ fig : avoidedcrossing ] ) .",
    "actually , we are in the slightly curious situation of already knowing the adiabatic basis and needing to find the diabatic basis .",
    "this is the converse of the usual situation .",
    "indeed , the adiabatic solutions are in a sense better defined because they correspond to the basis which diagonalizes the hamiltonian and is therefore unique",
    ". meanwhile , the diabatic basis is somewhat arbitrary because it corresponds to a particular `` undiagonalization '' of the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , this particular undiagonalization into the specific lz form ( [ lz - hamiltonian ] ) can easily be achieved by rotating the states correctly .",
    "we begin from the diagonalized lz matrix ( i.e.  lz hamiltonian in the adiabatic basis ) @xmath390 \\label{eq : diagonalized}\\ ] ] where @xmath391 are the adiabatic energies ( global wave numbers ) , where the plus sign corresponds to the solution which is even at @xmath30 .",

    "the relationship between the two sets of basis states is then @xmath398 and conversely @xmath399 the orthogonality relations satisfied by @xmath400 can be found by substituting eqns ( [ eq : ueven ] ) and ( [ eq : uodd ] ) into eq .",
