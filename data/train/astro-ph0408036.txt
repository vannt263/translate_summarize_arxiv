    "spirals may represent a more pristine population undisturbed by major disruptive events .",
    "the origin of intermediate types  particularly s0s  has been the subject of much debate .",
    "one proposed scenario to explain the apparent increase in the fraction of s0s in rich clusters over time @xcite is that , as spirals enter dense environments , their reservoirs of neutral gas are cut off either by disrupting further accretion ( i.e. , by strangulation ; larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ; balogh , navarro & morris 2000 ; bekki , couch & shioya 2002 ) , or by removing gas directly from the disk ( i.e. , via ram - pressure stripping ; gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "star formation in the disk would then cease , and the disk would evolve passively and fade as high - mass stars die . studies of clusters at higher redshift @xcite have uncovered a population of recently star forming ( @xmath0 1 - 2 gyr earlier ) , but now quiescent , galaxies with normal disk morphologies that those authors cite as possible examples of systems whose star formation was disrupted as described above .",
    "another possibility is that galaxy - galaxy interactions , including close tidal encounters and mergers , increase the luminosity of the bulge component by heating the central parts of the disk or triggering star formation in the center @xcite .",
    "extensive observations demonstrate that such interactions do increase central star formation rates @xcite and can produce bulge - enhanced merger remnants @xcite .",
    "these interactions are likely in clusters with substructure ( i.e. , poor groups accreted from the field ) , where the relative speeds and internal velocity dispersions of subcluster members are similar .",
    "both scenarios increase the bulge fraction , @xmath1 , the fraction of the total luminosity of a galaxy associated with the bulge .",
    "the first scenario increases @xmath1 by reducing the luminosity contribution from the disk .",
    "the second scenario increases @xmath1 by increasing the luminosity of the bulge .",
    "could either mechanism be responsible for generating the morphological sequence in clusters ?",
    "past observational work has attempted to address this question by comparing bulge fractions or bulge luminosities to hubble type and/or environment @xcite , with often conflicting conclusions .",
    "@xcite finds that the bulges of s0s are more luminous than those of spirals , and that their luminosity is increased in denser environments .",
    "in contrast , @xcite , working from the same sample , argue that disk luminosities are decreased in dense environments .",
    "@xcite finds bulge fractions of s0s to be similar to those of spirals above a certain @xmath1 , while @xcite find s0s to have systematically larger bulge fractions .",
    "several problems affect these studies : 1 ) while @xcite and @xcite consider a large , apparent magnitude - limited sample of cluster galaxies , they are not able to spectroscopically confirm cluster members and must resort to statistical background subtraction . @xcite have pointed out that background subtraction can fail in optically selected cluster samples , because cluster selection is biased towards clusters with higher - than - average background contamination . as a consequence",
    ", artificial correlations between environment and galaxy morphology could arise from interloping galaxies , especially at large projected radii from the cluster center , if the background subtraction is not perfect .",
    "2 ) hubble types are generally used as morphological quantifiers , a measure that is subjective and not easily reproducible .",
    "3 ) the bulge - disk decompositions in @xcite ( also used by solanes et al . )",
    "are done visually and affected by larger uncertainties than achievable with the best automated mechanisms and digital imaging .",
    "purely visual analysis techniques may also fail to resolve some bulges and disks , leading to incompletenesses that are difficult to quantify .",
    "4 ) none of the studies above quantify how their morphological classifications may be influenced by the bulge fraction .",
    "this bias , whether conscious or otherwise , may dramatically affect the interpretation of those results , because it could introduce intrinsic correlations between bulge and disk luminosities and morphological type .",
    "5 ) the impact of bulge enhancement and disk fading is on the luminosity distributions of the bulge and disk components , and the luminosity functions of bulges and disks are thus the best discriminators between the two evolutionary hypotheses outlined above , but only @xcite determine a luminosity function .",
    "this determination is semi - empirical and not calculated directly from the observed luminosity distribution of bulges .",
    "more recently , @xcite have calculated bulge and disk luminosity functions directly , but their sample is too small to hold any discriminatory power over the evolutionary mechanisms described above .    in this paper , we compare the luminosity functions for bulges and disks , calculated directly from a sample of several hundred spectroscopically - confirmed cluster galaxies @xcite to determine whether early type galaxies could have evolved from late type galaxies by disk fading alone .",
    "we use the bulge fraction , @xmath1 , rather than hubble type , as a quantitative , reproducible measure of morphology , which enables us to account for any bias that could introduce intrinsic correlations between bulge luminosity and morphology . by examining bulge and disk luminosities as a function of projected radial distance from the cluster center ,",
    "we test whether the morphology - environment relation @xcite could have been generated principally by bulge - enhancing or disk - diminishing effects .",

    "we then determine the mean and scatter of the value of the luminosity function in each magnitude bin due to these @xmath1 uncertainties and add the scatter in quadrature to the poisson errors .",

    "does this result imply that the disk luminosities of individual galaxies remain constant as a function of radial distance ?",
    "on its own , the fact that the correlation coefficient is close to zero does not permit such a conclusion , because effects at the bright and at the faint end of the disk luminosity function could cancel each other .",
    "for example , a simultaneous brightening of the brightest @xmath73 and increase in the number of faint disks could conspire to keep the median disk luminosity constant .",

    "however , if we consider both observations together  that neither the characteristic bright - end disk magnitude nor the median disk luminosity of all galaxies with @xmath38 vary significantly as a function of projected radius  then we can conclude that radial distance has no significant effect on the luminosities of individual galaxy disks .",

    "using a new survey of six clusters of galaxies @xcite , we constrain the mechanisms by which early - type galaxies may evolve from late - type galaxies in two ways : 1 ) by comparing the luminosities of bulges and disks as functions of overall galaxy morphology , as measured by the bulge fraction @xmath1 , and 2 ) by comparing the trends of bulge and disk luminosity with radial distance from the cluster center .    models that generate early type galaxies by fading the disks of late - type galaxies are ruled out for a wide range of morphologies .",

    "there is a significant tendency for bulges to be brighter towards the cluster center , while galaxy disks have a similar luminosity regardless of their position within the cluster .",
    "this test reveals no evidence that cluster - specific processes reduce the luminosity of disks , and thus does not support disk fading mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping or strangulation as shapers of the morphological sequence in clusters . instead , our results favor processes like galaxy - galaxy interactions and mergers , which can enhance galaxy bulges . such processes are more efficient in lower - density environments such as poor groups of galaxies , which , when accreted hierarchically by clusters , may have played a major role in generating the morphological sequence that we observe in rich clusters today .",

    "<S> we examine whether early - type galaxies in clusters may have evolved from later types by the fading of their disks ( e.g. , as a result of ram - pressure stripping or strangulation ) or by enhancement of the bulge luminosity ( e.g. , due to tidal interactions and mergers ) . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the bulge and disk luminosities of early- and late - type galaxies and of galaxies at different radial distances from the cluster center . we find that , in order for early - type galaxies , including s0s , to have evolved from late - type galaxies , their bulge luminosities must have been physically enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> disk fading models can not explain the differences observed . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that galaxy bulges are systematically brighter at small projected distances from the cluster center , while disk luminosities are uncorrelated with cluster - centric distance . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that bulge enhancement , not disk fading , distinguishes early from late types and is thus at least partially responsible for the morphology - environment relation of bright cluster galaxies . </S>"
