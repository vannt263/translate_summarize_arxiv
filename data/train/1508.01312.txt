    "the subject of the paper is the construction of new numerical method for cauchy and initial - boundary problems for scalar conservation laws .",
    "the method is a generalization of the transport - collapse scheme introduced in @xcite . a consequence of the analysis of the scheme is a new solution concept of the initial - boundary value problem for scalar conservation laws , and this is the most important contribution of the paper .",
    "in order to introduce it , let @xmath0 be a bounded smooth domain and @xmath1 .",
    "we consider @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "if not stated otherwise , we assume that @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath6    a typical problem described by , , arises e.g. in traffic flow models .",
    "namely , if we aim to describe a flow on a finite highway ( required to model on and off ramps ) we need to use boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for instance , optimization of travel time and cost between two points can be obtained by controlling incoming and outgoing car densities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the boundary conditions can not be prescribed if the characteristics corresponding to equation and emerging from the boundary leave @xmath7 .",
    "this means that one needs to introduce a new concept defining what conditions the unknown function @xmath8 should satisfy in order to be a solution to , , .",
    "this was first done in @xcite where the existence of strong traces at the boundary of solutions is assumed ; see @xcite .",
    "the weak formulation which does not require existence of strong traces was later proposed by f.otto @xcite and the corresponding numerical method was developed in @xcite .",
    "the concept is further extended in @xcite in a more general setting ( on manifolds necessarily implying that the flux depends on @xmath9 ) .",
    "let us recall it here .",
    "[ def - panov]a function @xmath10 is said to be the weak entropy solution to , , if there exists a constant @xmath11 such that for every @xmath12 and every non - negative @xmath13 , @xmath14 , it holds    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the measure on @xmath18 .    as it comes to the refinement of the latter concept , we actually base it on an interesting observation from @xcite roughly stating that if the characteristics emerging from @xmath19 hit the boundary then the corresponding boundary value should not affect the solution .",
    "thus , we are going to construct the definition of solution so that it involves somehow only those parts of the boundary which essentially influence on solutions .    to be more precise , assume that we are dealing with the flux depending on @xmath9 i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "denote by @xmath21 where @xmath22 contains all essential values of the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( i.e. of appropriate entropy solution @xmath8 ) , and @xmath25 is the outer unit normal on @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath26 actually consists of all points such that all possible characteristics from that point enter into the ( interior of the ) set @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath27 , the trace of the corresponding entropy solution is actually @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , for    @xmath29 all possible characteristics issuing from @xmath30 leave the set @xmath7 , and @xmath28 does not influence on the weak entropy solution @xmath8 to , , .    however , both sets @xmath26 and @xmath31 can be empty since for some @xmath32 , it can be @xmath33 and for other @xmath34 we could have @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in order to refine former arguments , we need to rewrite considered conservation laws so that we can more accurately take into account behaviour of the flux @xmath36 with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "a natural choice is the kinetic formulation to since it includes the variable @xmath37 in a desired way . before we introduce it ,",
    "let us recall the kruzhkov entropy admissibility conditions for ( general , heterogeneous ) scalar conservation laws .    [ def1 ] a bounded function @xmath8",
    "is called an entropy admissible solution to @xmath38 with the initial conditions if for every convex function @xmath39 , every @xmath40 and every non - negative @xmath41 , it holds @xmath42 d\\mx dt \\\\ & + \\int_{\\r^d } v(u_0(\\mx))\\varphi(0,\\mx ) d\\mx\\leq 0 ; \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of the heterogeneous equation , we shall consider the cauchy problem .",
    "as we shall see , the heterogeneity causes significant technical challenges .",
    "it is possible to overcome them in the case of the boundary problem as well , but we believe that this would be unnecessary complication which would hide main ideas of the new initial - boundary concept . in the numerical examples at the end of the paper , we shall take a space dependent flux in order to show how the method works in general situations .",
    "equivalent and more usual definition of admissible solution is given by the kruzhkov entropies @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and it states that a bounded function @xmath8 is called an entropy admissible solution to , if for every @xmath40 it holds @xmath45 + { \\rm sgn}(u-\\lambda)\\div_{\\mx}f(t,\\mx,\\lambda ) \\leq 0\\end{aligned}\\]]in the sense of distributions on @xmath46 , and it holds @xmath47 .",
    "roughly speaking , by finding derivative with respect to @xmath37 in one reaches to the kinetic formulation provided below ( see e.g. @xcite for different variants ) .",
    "[ db]@xcite the function @xmath48 is the entropy admissible solution to , if and only if there exists a non - negative radon measure @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for all @xmath51 and such that the function @xmath52 represents the distributional solution to @xmath53=\\pa_\\lambda m(t,\\mx,\\lambda ) , \\ \\ ( t,\\mx)\\in \\r^+\\times \\r^d , \\\\ \\label{ickin } & \\chi(\\lambda , u(t=0,\\mx))=\\chi(\\lambda , u_0(\\mx)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 .    in the next section , we shall provide properties of the function @xmath55 .",
    "remark that through the kinetic concept , one reduces the nonlinear equation on the linear ( so called kinetic ) equation ( see theorem [ db ] )",
    ". however , derivative of a measure figures in the equation ( see the right - hand side of ) and it has one more variable which is usually called kinetic or velocity variable . due to the former reason ,",
    "the kinetic equation is not convenient for numerical implementation . nevertheless ,",
    "if we neglect the derivative of the measure , and then average out the solution to the obtained linear equation with respect to the kinetic variable , we obtain entropy solution to the considered problem .",
    "such a procedure is proposed in @xcite for cauchy problems corresponding to equation .",
    "one of the aims of the paper is to extend the transport - collapse scheme @xcite for the initial value problem for heterogeneous scalar conservation laws .",
    "the power of the method to be presented is in its ability to transform nonlinear problem into linear .",
    "linear scalar conservation laws are easy to solve numerically since there are a lot of robust numerical schemes available .",
    "the cost of that `` transformation '' in practical computing is adding one more dimension ( see ) .",
    "moreover , we shall use the transport - collapse techniques to construct the bounded function @xmath8 satisfying the following definition .",
    "[ def2 ] we say that the function @xmath56)$ ] is a weak entropy admissible solution to , , if for every @xmath12 and every non - negative @xmath57 it holds    @xmath58    and    @xmath59    it is not difficult to see that if @xmath8 satisfies conditions of definition [ def2 ] then @xmath8 also satisfies definition [ def - panov ] .",
    "this will be proved in the last section .",
    "let us briefly comment definition [ def2 ] .",
    "the first two terms on the left - hand sides of and are standard in the entropy admissibility concept ( compare with definition [ def - panov ] and ) and they are related to the behaviour of the solution @xmath8 in the interior of @xmath7 and on @xmath60 .",
    "the final terms on the left - hand sides of and simply say that when the characteristics enter @xmath7 ( i.e. when the angle between the normal @xmath25 and @xmath61 is greater than @xmath62 , i.e. when @xmath63 ) then we shall take the boundary data into account .",
    "remark that we shifted a solution by @xmath64 in and by @xmath65 in since then @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , implying @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this enabled us precise control of the behaviour of the solution at the boundary ( see the last section ) .",
    "finally , let us remark that work in the field of numerical methods for conservation laws is rather intensive .",
    "most of the papers deal with cauchy problems for conservation laws ( scalar conservation laws or systems ; see e.g. classical books @xcite and references therein ) . as for , , , there are not so many results since the interest for this kind of problem has arisen relatively recently .",
    "we mention @xcite and references therein . for results in the case of systems ,",
    "one can consult @xcite where one can also find thorough overview of the subject .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall prove convergence of the transport - collapse scheme for initial value problems corresponding to .",
    "in section 3 , we shall introduce a transport - collapse type operator for , , , and the proof of its convergence toward the entropy solution .",
    "the transport - collapse scheme is based on tracking of characteristics of conservation law . in the homogeneous case",
    "( i.e. when the flux is independent of @xmath70 ) , the characteristic have very simple form @xmath71 and it is significantly easier to analyse them than in the case when the flux is @xmath70-dependent .",
    "thus , this section represents a non - trivial generalization of the method from @xcite .",
