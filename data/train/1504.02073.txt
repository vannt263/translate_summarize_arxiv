    "we will also introduce a different setup , where the leads are now coupled to frequency selective cavities ( or tunable lc reonators which can be built with current technology @xcite ) .",

    "exotic many - body physics has also been addressed @xcite .",
    "we now briefly discuss the physics of our setup .",
    "naturally , no current is rectified when the system is put in state of overall zero temperature : it is necessary to give some energy to the system for a current to flow .",
    "we consider two ways to do this : first , we consider the case when the conduction electrons are at zero temperature so that the charging energy of the quantum dot forbids electrons to tunnel onto it . however , if the quantum dot is capacitively coupled to an electrical environment via capacitance @xmath6 with impedance @xmath5 , and temperature @xmath9 , the electrons have a new way of gaining energy : photons from the hot impedance can be absorbed , allowing the electrons to tunnel onto the dot .",
    "this corresponds to the setup displayed in the fig .",
    "second , we consider a model where the electrons in the two leads are in thermal equilibrium , both at the same small temperature @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to the setup displayed in the fig .",
    "in both cases , the finite charging energy of the quantum dot requires an energy @xmath10 from the incoming electron to be occupied . in the first case , this is supplied by absorbing a photon from the hot circuit ; in the second it is from the fact that some of the electrons are thermally populated into that energy .",
    "giving some energy to the system is however not sufficient to induce a current .",
    "we also need to break the spatial symmetry of the system in order to favor one direction of tunneling events with respect to the other .",
    "this can be done by coupling the leads to zero temperature electrical circuits with different impedances @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or the same impedance but with different coupling capacitances @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) . to leave the dot ,",
    "the electron must reenter the fermi sea of the quasi - particles surrounding it .",
    "this process is sensitive to the vacuum fluctuations of the electrical circuit .",
    "if the impedances coupled to the two leads are different , the fluctuations of the vacuum will break left / right symmetry , giving a preferred direction for the particle to exit the system into - thus giving current rectification .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate a quantum dot coupled to fermionic ( electronic ) leads and show how zero - point quantum fluctuations stemming from bosonic environments permit the rectification of the current . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic baths are either external impedances modeled as tunable transmission lines or lc resonators ( single - mode cavities ) . </S>",
    "<S> voltage fluctuations stemming from the external impedances at zero temperature are described through harmonic oscillators ( photon - like excitations ) then producing the quantum vacuum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the differing sizes of the zero - point fluctuations of the quantum vacuum break the spatial symmetry of the system if the quantum dot is coupled to two reservoirs or two junctions with different bosonic environments . </S>",
    "<S> we consider current rectification and power production when the system is operated as a heat engine in both non - resonant and resonant sequential tunneling cases . </S>"
