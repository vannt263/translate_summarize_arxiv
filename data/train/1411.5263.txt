    "in its original form , gi hypothesis posited that gas giants are made in situ by gravitational fragmentation of a massive protoplanetary disc @xcite .",
    "this has been correctly criticised @xcite since the discs can actually fragment only beyond @xmath0 tens of au @xcite .",
    "however , since simulations show that gi fragments migrate in rapidly @xcite , it appears perfectly feasible for them to form at @xmath1  au but then end up arbitrarily close to the parent star due to disc migration .",
    "furthermore , some of the fragments could give birth to earth - mass or more massive cores due to grain sedimentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if these gas fragments are tidally disrupted , only the cores survive @xcite , which potentially provides a new pathway to forming all kinds of planets at all separations in a single framework that was called `` tidal downsizing '' ( td ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , there appears to be a major inconsistency of td / gi with observations .",
    "are much more frequent around metal - rich hosts @xcite . radiative contraction of gi planets is slower at high metallicities @xcite , hence predicting fewer planets surviving tidal disruption .",
    "core accretion ( ca ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) paradigm is , in contrast , consistent with the metallicity trend and explains it as a consequence of a more robust massive core assembly at high metallicities .",
    "nayakshin ( 2014b ) showed that accretion of medium sized grains (  pebbles  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onto pre - collapse gas fragments actually speeds up their contraction and collapse . in this picture",
    "giant planets collapse not due to emission of radiation ( like stars do ) but due to accretion of metals in small grains , which acts as an effective cooling mechanism ( cf .",
    "equation [ etot ] below and figure 1 ) .",
    "this paper presents first detailed coupled planet - disc evolutionary calculations of td hypothesis that incorporate this new physics , treating non - linear disc - planet interaction , the rate of grain deposition into the planet and its response to that in detail . a grid of models covering a reasonable range in poorly constrained parameters of the model ( such as grain opacity , disc viscosity , etc . )",
    "is calculated to delineate statistical trends of the model .",
    "a strong positive correlation of planet survival probability with metallicity of the host is found .",
    "we also note in passing that bowler et al ( 2015 , arxiv:1411.3722 ) find that giant gas planets are extremely rare at large @xmath1  au separation from their parent stars , which the authors interpret as evidence that gravitational instability does _ not _ produce giant planets often .",
    "this interpetation of the data is based on outdated ideas in which gi planets do not migrate .",
    "modern simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all show that that gi clumps migrate in rapidly .",
    "another interpretation of the bowler et al ( 2015 ) results , consistent with the papers cited above and the calculations below , is that most of gi fragments migrate closer in to the star and are either tidally destroyed and became terrestrial like planets or survive the disruption and became hot jupiters instead .",
    "in the protoplanetary disc environment , both gas and grains are gravitationally attracted to massive bodies embedded in it , but gas has pressure gradient forces able to resist the pull , whereas grains do not .",
    "grains that are moderately weakly coupled to gas via aerodynamical friction  grains of a few cm in size , @xmath2 , in the inner disc , but @xmath3 mm or less in the outer disc  are captured by the body most efficiently @xcite .",
    "pebble accretion rate appropriate for the massive planets that we study here is @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath5 is keplerian velocity at the planet s location , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the surface densities of pebbles and gas , respectively , and @xmath9 is the fraction of pebbles in the total grain surface density ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 increases linearly with @xmath12 due to a more rapid grain growth at higher @xmath12 , so @xmath13 , where @xmath14  const@xmath15 is a free parameter , and @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the disc and solar metallicities , respectively .",
    "the disc surface density at the planet s location , @xmath8 , is not independent of the planet , as the planet interacts with the disc strongly .",
    "following @xcite , the protoplanetary disc is described by a viscous azimuthally symmetric time - dependent model that includes the tidal torque of the planet on the disc @xmath17    -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial    r}\\left(2\\omega r^2\\lambda\\sigma\\right )   \\label{eq : diffplanet}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the disc surface density at radius @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the tidal torque from the planet",
    ". the torque can be either in type i ( no gap ) or type ii ( a gap in the disc is opened ) .",
    "two - dimensional hydro simulations @xcite show that a deep gap in the disc is opened when parameter @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the disc vertical scale height at @xmath6 , and @xmath23 is the disc viscosity parameter . based on this result",
    ", we smoothly join the type i and type ii regimes using the self - consistently found value of @xmath24 at the location around the planet .",
    "this approach is necessary since migration rates of planets depend sensitively on whether a gap in the disc is opened or not @xcite .",
    "nayakshin ( 2014b ) , @xcite , uses a 1d spherically symmetric radiative hydrodynamics ( rhd ) code with grains treated as a second fluid to simulate contraction of an otherwise isolated planet that accretes grains .",
    "such an approach is unfortunately too computationally expensive in the framework of a full disc - planet interaction problem , and forced previous workers to use analytical models for the planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    ", a simpler `` follow the adiabat '' approach @xcite in which the planet is assumed isentropic , is used .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since the energy transfer inside the planet is strongly dominated by convection even at solar opacities / metallicities @xcite . for a given initial conditions , e.g. , the planet mass , @xmath25 , the central fragment s temperature , @xmath26 , and grain properties for each radial zone in the planet ,",
    "a solution of the equilibrium equations is found by iterations on the central gas density .",
    "this determines planetary radius , @xmath27 , and the total energy of the planet , @xmath28 , which is then evolved in time according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radiative luminosity of the planet , and the last term on the right is the change in the gravitational potential energy of the planet due to grain accretion on it at the rate @xmath31 .",
    "after evolving @xmath28 by a small amount , a grain growth step of same duration then follows .",
    "the new total energy and grain properties in every zone in the planet then allow us to determine the new planet s structure , which is found by iterating on both @xmath26 and the central gas density",
    ". the procedure is then repeated .",
    "we tested the isentropic approach against the rhd code for a number of fragment contraction cases , including metal loading tests on the planet , and found an acceptable ( typically @xmath32% ) agreement .",
    "it is important to point out the following .",
    "pebbles sedimenting down onto the planet do so at differential velocities ( usually linearly proportional to their size , @xmath2 ) . from experiments",
    "it is well known that grains colliding at velocities exceeding a few m  s@xmath33 fragment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of td",
    ", @xcite showed that grain - grain collisions limits the grain size inside the planets to a few cm .",
    "therefore , the velocity with which pebbles impact the planet , @xmath34 , can not be much larger than a few m  s@xmath33 , which is very small compared to the escape velocity from the planet , @xmath35  m  s@xmath33 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37  au is used .",
    "for this reason the kinetic energy input term in equation [ etot ] , @xmath38 , is neglected .",
    "this is in stark contrast to ca theory ( ca ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the solids from the disc enter the planet as planetesimals  huge rocks very poorly coupled to gas  and impact the growing planets at @xmath39 and therefore heat the gaseous envelope strongly .",
    "solids may nevertheless heat the gas envelope in both scenarios if they eventually reach a _ massive _ solid core in the planet .",
    "this effect is not considered here but is included in a follow - up paper .    following @xcite , dust opacity in the fragment is directly proportional to the metallicity of the gas , @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the interstellar gas plus dust opacities from @xcite which assume solar metallicity , @xmath43 , and @xmath44",
    "const  @xmath45 is a positive constant which may be smaller than unity due to grain growth .",
    "before presenting the more complex planet - disc calculations , figure [ fig:1 ] shows evolution of central temperature for four isolated gi fragments of mass @xmath46 .",
    "black curves are for two different constant fragment metallicities , @xmath47 and 5 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the red curves are for fragments with metal abundance increasing at rate @xmath49 with @xmath50 labelled on the figure .",
    "the inset shows metallicity @xmath40 for the four cases .",
    "the red and the @xmath47 black curves end when @xmath26 reaches @xmath51  k , at which point h@xmath52 molecules dissociate , and the fragment collapses dynamically to much higher densities .",
    "this marks formation of a dense young jupiter that could survive tides in the inner disc .",
    "the @xmath53 fragment contracts the slowest due to a high dust opacity .",
    "in contrast , @xmath54 fragments ( red curves ) contract faster than the @xmath47 one .",
    "the metallicity of the fragment corresponding to the dot - dashed curve is @xmath55 yet it collapses @xmath56 times faster than the @xmath47 case .",
    "such a collapse could be termed `` dark '' as relatively little radiation is emitted during contraction of the planet .    as explained in nayakshin ( 2014b ) in detail , and can also be qualitatively seen from equation",
    "[ etot ] , accretion of pebbles by the fragments is a form of non - luminous cooling which is directly proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "this must help fragments to survive .",
    "for example , if the fragments from figure 1 were migrating inward on a time scale of @xmath57 years , the @xmath53 one would have been tidally destroyed in about 20,000 years , whereas the @xmath58  years fragment would have collapsed and could therefore continue to migrate almost arbitrarily close to the star .    to quantify these ideas , figure [ fig : disc_planet ] tests survival of fragments born at @xmath59  au for the pebble accretion model at three disc metallicities , @xmath60 1 and 2 for the dashed , dotted and solid curves , respectively .",
    "colours are used to delineate different quantities for the same fragment .",
    "the top panel shows time evolution of the planet s separation , @xmath6 , planet s radius , @xmath27 , and hill radius , @xmath61 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows metallicity of the planets , ( c ) shows central temperature , @xmath62 , and ( d ) compares the migration time scale , @xmath63 , where @xmath6 is planet s semi - major axis , with the metal loading time scale , @xmath64 , calculated self - consistently .",
    "namely , first @xmath31 in the hill s regime ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is found from the simulation , and then equation [ tz ] is inverted to find @xmath64 .",
    "initially , @xmath65 , so that tidal forces from the star are weak compared to the planet s self - gravity .",
    "as the planet migrates closer in , @xmath27 and @xmath66 decrease at different rates , and the planet is tidally disrupted if @xmath67 .    in all three cases , radiative cooling of",
    "the planet is negligible , that is , @xmath30 is much smaller ( or even _ negative _ due to planet irradiation from the disc , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the last term in equation [ etot ] .",
    "the planets therefore contract mainly due to accretion of pebbles . the higher the disc metallicity , the quicker the planet s metallicity increases with time , and the faster it contracts ( note that @xmath27 decreases and @xmath26 increases ) .",
    "the lowest metallicity planet is disrupted the soonest , at @xmath68  au .",
    "@xmath69 planet is about twice as compact , so it makes it to @xmath70  au before being disrupted .",
    "this planet almost manages to collapse ( reaches @xmath71  k ) , but @xmath31 plummets when a deep gap around the planet is opened after @xmath72 years ( note that @xmath73 at later times ) .",
    "starved of metals , the planet stops contracting and gets disrupted soon thereafter .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath74 planet contracts much more rapidly , and collapses at @xmath75 years , before it is tidally compromised .",
    "this planet could be driven into the `` hot jupiter '' region by a continuing disc migration , not simulated here .",
    "these results suggest that gi planets may be more likely to survive at higher @xmath76 . to ascertain metallicity trends of the model ,",
    "given large uncertainties in the input physics , a grid of fragment survival experiments just like those described in figure [ fig : disc_planet ] , but now repeated for parameters varied over a reasonably broad range , is run .",
    "parameter values in the grid are : disc viscosity @xmath77 ; planet s birth location , @xmath78 ; pebble mass fraction @xmath79 , 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "we also tested type i migration torque at @xmath80 , 1 and 2 times that from @xcite .",
    "the grid of models is calculated for 9 different disc metallicity values between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the fraction of planets surviving ( that is collapsing before being tidally disrupted ) is then found for each metallicity bin .",
    "this comprises 486 planet survival experiments in total .",
    "figure [ fig : zcorr ] shows the results for @xmath83 .",
    "fragments are indeed much more likely to survive at high @xmath12 than they are at low @xmath12 .",
    "black solid line shows the full grid of models , while the blue dotted and the red dashed lines show @xmath79 and 0.2 only , respectively .",
    "the correlation with metallicity remains strong but is shifted to higher @xmath12 ( lower @xmath12 ) if pebbles are less ( more ) abundant .",
    "the strength of the correlation appears sufficient to explain qualitatively the observed trend of giant planet frequency being proportional to @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : zmp ] shows the same grid of survival experiments as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zcorr ] , but now conducted for different planet s masses .",
    "it is seen that the correlation is qualitatively unchanged for @xmath85 and @xmath86 planets ( which are abundant in the * ? ? ?",
    "* sample ) .",
    "the final mass of the planet may be different from the pre - collapse value for two reasons .",
    "firstly , due to a substantial angular momentum of pre - collapse clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not all of the planet s mass may end up in the planet , some may end up in the circum - planetary disc and then be lost . on the other hand ,",
    "more gas could in principle be accreted from the disc onto the planet .",
    "these effects may extend the positive metallicity correlation found here for the @xmath87 planets to both lower and higher masses .",
    "planet survival experiments in the context of tidal downsizing model for planet formation @xcite were performed .",
    "the new ingredient in the model is `` pebble accretion '' of grains from the disc onto the fragments , plus simultaneous treatment of the coupled planet and disc evolutionary equations . since pebble accretion accelerates collapse of gas fragments , a strong positive correlation of the fraction of survived giant planets versus metallicity of the host is found .",
    "td / gi origin for giant gas planets is not , therefore , in conflict with the observed planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "formation of solid cores within the planets is turned off in the present paper for simplicity but is to be considered and reported on in a forthcoming paper .",
    "@xcite find results that are somewhat in disagreement with ours .",
    "they find a much more copious production of giant planets without pebble accretion which we found to be instrumental in driving the planets to collapse here .",
    "this difference in the results may be in part due to a different radiative cooling formalism used by @xcite .",
    "namely , these authors use earlier results of @xcite who studied disc fragmentation and gas fragment collapse in 3d simulations , which is clearly preferable to our 1d study in that aspect . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the radiative cooling of the fragments is modelled with a semi - analytical prescription ( as commonly done in 3d simulations of discs by a number of authors , see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than with a radiative transfer scheme",
    ". our results , on the other hand , are motivated ( nayakshin 2014b ) by radiative hydrodynamics simulations of contracting planets in which transfer of radiation is calculated with the classical radiation diffusion approximation , albeit in 1d .",
    "ideally , one would like to combine 3d hydrodynamics with 3d radiative transfer to study formation of giant planets .",
    "we must leave this challenging goal to future papers , unfortunately .",
