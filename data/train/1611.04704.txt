    "asymptotic analyses have been widely conducted in various research areas related to wireless communications .",
    "although they do not quite provide the same information as complete ( non - asymptotic ) results , they usually give very useful insights , while being much more tractable and available for larger classes of models .",
    "for example , the asymptotic coding gain in coding theory @xcite characterizes the difference of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) levels between the uncoded system and coded system required to reach the same bit error rate ( ber ) in the high - snr regime ( or equivalently , the low - ber regime ) ; the diversity gain and the multiplexing gain introduced in @xcite are also high - snr asymptotic metrics that crisply capture the trade - off between the snr exponents of the error probability and the data rate in mimo channels ; in wireless networks , the asymptotic transmission capacity @xcite gives the network performance when the density of interferers goes to 0 , or equivalently , in the high signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) regime .",
    "these asymptotic analyses provide simple and useful results that capture important design trade - offs . in this paper , we focus on the asymptotic analyses of the sir distribution in wireless networks , which is a key metric that determines many other performance metrics , such as the achievable reliability , transmission rate , and the delay  it is instrumental for the analysis and design of interference - limited wireless networks @xcite .",
    "our analysis is not limited to one scenario but comprehensively covers a wide range of models , including both ad hoc and cellular networks , both singular and bounded path loss laws , and general stationary point processes and general fading  unless otherwise specified . besides",
    ", we also consider networks where each location of the transmitter ( or antenna ) has another transmitter ( or antenna ) colocated , which results in non - simple point processes .    in all scenarios",
    ", we mainly analyze the asymptotic properties of the sir distribution . for cellular networks with nakagami-@xmath0 fading and both singular and bounded path loss models , it has been observed in @xcite that the success probability , defined as the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) of the sir , for different point processes are horizontally shifted versions of each other ( in db ) in the high - reliability regime .",
    "generally , in non - poisson networks , the success probability is intractable . under this observation ,",
    "however , we can obtain good approximations of the lower part of the sir distribution ( coverage probabilities above 3/4 ) for non - poisson networks if we know the result of the poisson networks and the corresponding shift amounts . for the tail of the sir distribution , a similar property holds , which has been proved in @xcite , if the singular path loss model is applied .",
    "in general , the horizontal gaps of the sir distributions between a point process and the poisson point process ( ppp ) at both ends differ slightly , so for higher accuracy , the two asymptotic regimes should be treated separately .",
    "this paper summarizes the known asymptotic properties , derives results for scenarios that have not been previously studied , and gives insight about the factors that mainly determine the behavior of the sir .",
    "the reasons that we focus on the asymptotic sir analysis include the following :    1 .",
    "it captures succinctly the performance of the various network models ( especially for the high - reliability regime ) .",
    "it permits the isolation of the key network properties that affect the sir distribution .",
    "3 .   it gives insight into when it is safe to use the singular path loss model instead of a bounded one .",
    "4 .   it shows when a nearest - interferer approximation is accurate .",
    "the tail determines whether the mean sir ( and higher moments ) exist .      for poisson networks ,",
    "the sir distribution has been derived in exact analytical form in a number of cases , namely for bipolar ad hoc networks with general fading @xcite , for ad hoc and cellular networks with successive interference cancellation @xcite , for multitier cellular networks ( hetnets ) with strongest - on - average base station association and base station cooperation without retransmissions @xcite and with retransmissions @xcite , for cellular networks with intra - cell diversity and/or base station silencing @xcite and for multitier cellular networks with instantaneously - strongest base station association @xcite . while for some specific assumptions ,",
    "closed - form expressions are available , the results for the sir distribution typically involve one or more integrals .    the only exact result for a non - poisson network is given in @xcite for cellular networks whose base stations form a ginibre process ; it contains several nested integrals and infinite sums and is very hard to evaluate numerically .    from these exact results ,",
    "simple asymptotic ones can often be derived , see , e.g. , @xcite , where results on the diversity gain are extracted from the more complicated complete results .",
    "the true power of the asymptotic approach , however , becomes apparent when general non - poisson models are considered , for which essentially no exact results are available .    in general ad hoc networks modeled using the bipolar model ,",
    "the asymptotic sir distribution as the interferer density goes to 0 has been analyzed for rayleigh fading in @xcite and for general fading in @xcite . in (",
    "* ch .  5 )",
    ", the interference in general ad hoc networks has been analyzed .",
    "relevant to our work here are the bounds on the ccdf of the interference and the asymptotic result on the interference distribution for both singular and bounded path loss models . in @xcite , we analyzed the asymptotic properties of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) distribution in general cellular networks in the high - reliability regime for nakagami-@xmath0 fading and both singular and bounded path loss models . in @xcite , a simple yet versatile analytical framework for approximating the sir distribution in the downlink of cellular systems",
    "was proposed using the mean interference - to - signal ratio , while @xcite considers general cellular networks with general fading and singular path loss and studies the asymptotic behavior of the sir distribution both at 0 and at infinity .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic properties of the ccdf of the sir @xmath1 , often referred to as the _ success probability _ or _",
    "coverage probability_. regarding the transmitter / base station ( bs ) distributions , we do not restrict ourselves to simple point processes ( where there is only one point at one location almost surely ) , which are the ones used in almost all the literature , but also consider",
    " duplicated-2-point \" point processes .",
    "the duplicated-2-point point processes are defined as the point processes where there are two points at the same location , i.e. , each point is duplicated .",
    "the motivation to study this model is three - fold : ( 1 ) by comparing the results with those for standard ( simple ) network models , it becomes apparent whether the asymptotic behavior critically depends on the fact that the distances to the desired transmitter and to the interferers are all different ( a.s . ) .",
    "( 2 ) there are situations where it is natural to consider a model where two nodes are at the same distance , such as when edge users ( who have two base stations at equal distance ) in cellular networks are analyzed or when spectrum sharing between different operators is assumed and the two operators share a base station tower .",
    "( 3 ) the only kind of networks that are not captured by simple models are those that are formed by two fully correlated point processes .",
    "the  duplicated \" models fills this gap .",
    "the asymptotic properties of @xmath2 are summarized in table [ t_total ] with respect to @xmath3 as @xmath4 and @xmath5 for both singular and bounded path loss models , both ad hoc models and cellular models , and both simple point processes and duplicated-2-point point processes .",
    "our results show that the asymptotic sir behavior is determined by two factors@xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0 is the nakagami fading parameter and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the path loss exponent .",

    "based on the insight obtained from the asymptotic results for the cases where the total interference is taken into account and where only the nearest interferer is considered , we can formulate three conjectures that succinctly summarize and generalize our findings for both cellular and ad hoc models  assuming they hold .",
    "let @xmath56 be the desired transmitter and @xmath57 the nearest interferer .",
    "@xmath58    in words , this conjecture states that if the ( mean ) power of the nearest interferer can get arbitrarily large relative to that of the desired transmitter , then the outage probability only decays with @xmath59 as @xmath60 , and vice versa .",

    "if the signal power is bounded and the fading is exponential , the tail will be exponential with @xmath63 .",
    "we considered a comprehensive class of wireless network models where transmitters / bss follow general point processes and analyzed the asymptotic properties of the lower and upper tails of the sir distribution . in all cases ,",
    "the lower tail of the sir distribution decays as a power law . only the path loss exponent or the fading parameter determines the asymptotic order for ad hoc networks ; only the fading parameter determines the asymptotic order for cellular networks .",
    "this indicates that we can use the sir distribution of the ppp to approximate the sir distribution of non - poisson models in the high - reliability regime by applying a horizontal shift , which can be obtained using the mean interference - to - signal ratio ( misr ) defined in @xcite . for the tail of the sir distribution , only cellular network models with singular path loss have power - law tails . in these cases ,",
    "we can approximate the tail of the sir distribution of non - poisson networks using the corresponding poisson result and the expected fading - to - interference ratio ( efir ) defined in @xcite . for cellular networks with bounded path loss and ad hoc networks , we mainly investigated the poisson case with rayleigh fading and showed that the tail of the sir distribution decays exponentially .",
    "the exponential decay does not imply that it is not possible to approximate the tail of the sir distribution for non - poisson networks using the distribution of poisson networks .",
    "we conjecture that the same approximation method as for polynomial tails can be applied , but a proof of the feasibility of this approach is beyond the scope of this paper and left for future work .    moreover , we investigated the impact of the nearest interferer on the asymptotic properties of the sir distribution .",
    "if the nearest interferer is the only interferer in the networks , we proved that the scaling of the lower tail of the sir distribution remains the same as when all interferers are taken into account , which means that the nearest interferer alone determines the decay order .",
    "in contrast , for the tail of the sir distribution , the nearest interferer alone does not dominate the asymptotic trend , and the tail decays as a power law , with a light tail in most cases and a heavy tail for simple cellular networks with singular path loss .",
