    "after the seminal work of lorenz @xcite , it is well understood that the predictability of the state of a system ruled by a deterministic evolution law has severe limitations in presence of deterministic chaos . in systems with sensitive dependence on the initial condition one has an exponential divergence of the distance @xmath1 between two initially close trajectories , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the maximum lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "consequently , if @xmath3 and one accepts a maximum tolerance @xmath4 on the knowledge of the state of the system , ( [ eq : dx ] ) implies that the systems is predictable up to a time @xmath5    equation ( [ eq : tlyap ] ) gives only a first rough answer to the problem since it does not take into account some important features of chaotic systems .",
    "endeed to study the predictability of a generic dynamical system one has to consider the following non trivial aspects :    * \\a ) the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 is a global quantity : it measures the average exponential rate of divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "in general there are finite - time fluctuations of this rate and it is possible to define an ` instantaneous ' rate @xmath6 , called effective lyapunov exponent @xcite , which depends on the particular point of the trajectory @xmath7 where the perturbation is performed . in the same way , the predictability time @xmath8 fluctuates , following the @xmath6-variations . *",
    "\\b ) in dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom , the interactions among different parts of the system play an important role on the growth of a perturbation .",
    "the statistics of the effective lyapunov exponent is not sufficient to characterize the growth of infinitesimal perturbations and one has to analyze the behavior of the tangent vector @xmath9 , i.e. of the direction along which an infinitesimal perturbation grows , see e.g @xcite .",
    "moreover , if one is interested in the behaviour of a perturbation concentrated on certain degrees of freedom , e.g. small length scales in weather forecasting , and in a prediction on the evolution of other degrees of freedom , e.g. large length scales , a relevant quantity is the time @xmath10 necessary to the tangent vector to relax on the time dependent eigenvector @xmath11 of the stability matrix , corresponding to the maximum lyapunov exponent . if the perturbations are small enough , i.e. @xmath1 is proportional to the tangent vector , one has that @xmath12 where in general @xmath10 may depend on @xmath13",
    ". so the mechanism of transfer of the error @xmath13 through the degrees of freedom of the system could be more important than the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories @xcite .",
    "* \\c ) in systems with many characteristic times , such as the eddy turn - over times in fully developed turbulence , if the perturbation is not infinitesimal , or if the threshold of accepted error is not small , @xmath8 is determined by the detailed mechanism of transfer due to the non - linear effects in the evolution equation for @xmath13 . in this case",
    ", the predictability time might have no relation with the lyapunov exponent and @xmath8 depends in a non - trivial way on the details of the system .",
    "the aspects a ) and b ) have been studied in previous works @xcite . in this paper",
    "we mainly address point c ) .",
    "we investigate the predictability problem for non - infinitesimal perturbations in the framework of two models : a system of coupled maps , and a shell model for the energy cascade in three dimensional turbulence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : somer ] we discuss some phenomenological results in fully developed turbulence . in section [ sec : maps ] the predictability problem is discussed in a system of coupled maps , using analytic methods supported by some numerical investigations .",
    "section [ sec : shellm ] analyzes the more realistic case of a shell model of turbulence by both numerical simulations and closure approximations . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the physical relevance of our results and open problems .",
    "in three dimensional fully developed turbulence , the inverse maximum lyapunov exponent is roughly proportional to the smallest characteristic time of the system , the turn - over time @xmath14 of eddies of the size of the kolmogorov length @xmath15 .",
    "the argument , due to ruelle @xcite , is the following .",
    "the kolmogorov theory predicts that the longitudinal velocity difference at distance @xmath16 scales as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the typical velocity and length of the energy containing eddies , and @xmath20 is the mean rate of energy dissipation .",
    "the non - linear transfer of energy is stopped at the kolmogorov scale @xmath15 where viscosity @xmath21 is able to compete with the convective term , i.e. @xmath22 , thus from ( [ eq : dvl ] ) we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reynolds number .",
    "the corresponding turn - over time is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the life time of the large scale disturbances .",
    "these dimensional relations imply that the maximum lyapunov exponent scales with @xmath27 as @xmath28    taking into account the intermittency one expects that the presence of quiescent quasi - laminar periods changes the chaotic features of the fluid flow .",
    "the intermittency of energy dissipation can be described by introducing a spectrum of singularities @xmath29 of the velocity gradients @xcite , i.e. assuming a local scaling invariance so that in any point @xmath30 of the fluid @xmath31 . in the framework of the multifractal approach ,",
    "one thus finds @xcite @xmath32 \\label{eq : lambdamf}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the fractal dimension of the set of fluid points characterized by a given singularity @xmath29 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 depends on @xmath33 . by using the function @xmath33 obtained by fitting the exponents @xmath35 of the velocity structure functions with the random beta model @xcite",
    ", one has @xmath36 , slightly smaller than the ruelle prediction @xmath37 , see ( [ eq : lambda ] )    relation ( [ eq : tlyap ] ) and ( [ eq : lambdamf ] ) tell us that considering a very small perturbation at @xmath38 and a very small tolerance @xmath4 , the predictability time vanishes as the reynolds number increases , as verified in recent numerical simulations of the shell model ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : shellm ] ) @xcite .    on a very different ground , without considering the exponential growth of infinitesimal disturbances , lorenz @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite , proposed a phenomenological approach to the predictability problem in turbulence .",
    "consider wave - numbers around @xmath39 with corresponding typical spatial scale @xmath40 .",
    "the time @xmath41 for a perturbation at wavenumber @xmath42 to induce a complete uncertainty on the velocity field on the wave number @xmath39 is assumed to be proportional to the typical eddy turn - over time at scale @xmath43 , from ( [ eq : dvl ] ) : @xmath44    an incertitude @xmath45 propagates through an inverse cascade from the kolmogorov scale @xmath46 up to the scale of the energy containing eddies @xmath47 .",
    "the predictabilty time on the large scales is therefore @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the geometric series ( [ eq : tsum ] ) is dominated by the term @xmath50 so that @xmath8 is practically independent of reynolds number : @xmath51    it is worth remarking that closure approximations @xcite allows one to write down simple equations for the evolution of disturbances in turbulent flows and fully confirm these results . in appendix b",
    ", we derive this type of equations in the simplified framework of the shell model , but there are no conceptual differences with the analogous derivation in the case of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the lorenz picture of an inverse cascade of a perturbation also permits to estimate the growth of a perturbation at intermediate times .",
    "indeed , after a time @xmath52 , a perturbation localized on the kolmogorov length scale , is expected to affect an eddy of size @xmath53 such that its turn - over time is @xmath54 .",
    "it follows @xcite , see ( [ eq : taulorenz ] ) @xmath55 let us indicate by @xmath56 the reference velocity field and by @xmath57 the perturbed field .",
    "the size of the difference @xmath58 between two velocity fields at time @xmath52 can be estimated as the typical velocity of a disturbance at scale @xmath53 , so that from ( [ eq : dvl ] ) and ( [ eq : scalet ] ) @xmath59 perturbations grow as square root of time .",
    "let us stress again that such perturbations can not be considered infinitesimal so that the inverse cascade picture is not in contrast with the exponential amplification of errors on initial conditions that is present in chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "there are two main predictions of the lorenz approach : predictability time on large scale independent of reynolds number and growth of perturbations as a power of time instead of an exponential .    in the next sections we use the theory of dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom to argue that while the former is correct , the latter is a too rough description of the real behavior of @xmath58 .",
    "in this section we discuss the predictability problem in a system of coupled maps each with a different time scale .",
    "this is an idealized situation where each degree of freedom has a chaotic dynamics with its own characteristic time and it is coupled to the other degrees of freedom by a weak local interaction .",
    "our toy model can be considered the prototype for physical situations where one can separate the evolution on different scales . despite its simplicity , it displays non - trivial properties which enlighten the behaviour of more complex systems .",
    "the system is given by a chain of chaotic coupled maps @xmath60 where the @xmath61 variables @xmath62 are defined on the interval @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath20 is the coupling constant , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are functions of @xmath66 into itself . in order to mimic the energy cascade of turbulent flow , we assume that the function @xmath64 represents the evolution law of an eddy of size @xmath67 in the absence of interactions . in this context ,",
    "@xmath68 can be regarded as the velocity difference of the eddies on the octave of length scale @xmath69 .",
    "the evolution is chaotic with a lyapunov exponent proportional to the inverse of the eddy turn - over time @xmath70 .",
    "the simplest possible choice for @xmath71 is the piecewise linear map @xmath72    from dimensional arguments , and using ( [ eq : taulorenz ] ) we can estimate the eddy turn - over time @xmath70 so that the lyapunov exponent is @xmath73    the coupling parameter @xmath20 is small and constant for each scale , although more realistic models could consider scale - dependent couplings .",
    "the form of @xmath74  the term representing the local interaction between eddies  does not affect the qualitative results .",
    "we have considered two possibilities : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    in order to study",
    "the predictability , the system ( [ eq : guno ] ) has been integrated with two different initial conditions @xmath77 and @xmath78 differing on the smallest scale , @xmath79 .",
    "the initial incertitude is thus confined to the smallest and fastest scale @xmath80 while we want to forecast the behavior of the system at the largest scale @xmath81 .",
    "because time - scales are well separated , we expect that at the beginning the uncertainty in the system is driven by the fastest scale @xmath80 and the error at any scale grows with the smallest characteristic time @xmath82 where the power of @xmath20 is due to the locality of the interactions .",
    "the behavior ( [ eq : gtre ] ) will last up to the time @xmath83 at which the perturbation at small scale saturates , i.e. @xmath84 . then a second regime drived by the variable @xmath85 , which has now the fastest exponential growth of errors , sets in .",
    "when this second regime holds , the incertitudes at scales @xmath86 grows as @xmath87 until , at time @xmath88 , the variable @xmath85 saturates and @xmath89 dominates , and so on .",
    "such an argument suggests that a perturbation @xmath90 at the largest scale @xmath81 follows different exponential laws with rates @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) in each different regimes , with a global ( envelope ) evolution which appear very similar to a power law .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the error observed at large scale @xmath90 as a function of time in a numerical experiment realized with a chain of @xmath93 maps .",
    "the coupling function is chosen linear , @xmath75 , the coupling parameter is @xmath94 , the largest characteristic time is @xmath95 .",
    "the initial conditions are random and the initial perturbation on the small scale is @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the error observed at large scale @xmath90 as a function of time .",
    "some exponential regimes are still recognizable , the straight lines with different slopes in the linear - logarithmic plot .    the observed behaviour can be well understood by means of a quasi - linear analysis which also allows for some analytical estimates .",
    "the evolution with ( [ eq : guno3 ] ) and linear @xmath74 leads to a linear evolution for the perturbation , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath99 jacobian matrix @xmath100 let us denote with @xmath101 the time at which scale @xmath39 saturates , i.e. @xmath102 , and with @xmath103 the period ( number of steps ) during which scale @xmath39 dominates the dynamics , i.e. @xmath104 . if we suppose that the main contribution to the growth of perturbations during period @xmath103 is given by the faster scale @xmath105 , which is correct whenever @xmath20 is very small , we can write for any @xmath106 @xmath107 while @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "the matrix @xmath110 can be easily computed and at the leading order is given by @xmath111 the saturation periods are given by @xmath112 so that from ( [ eq : gsei ] ) , ( [ eq : gsette ] ) , ( [ eq : gotto ] ) and using the fact that @xmath113 we obtain @xmath114    figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the result obtained averaging over @xmath115 initial perturbations .",
    "scattered markers represent the values of @xmath116 at the different saturation times , obtained according to the quasi - linear analysis .",
    "the agreement with the direct simulation of ( [ eq : guno ] ) is quite good .",
    "the global behavior can be fitted by a power law , whose slope can be roughly estimated by the following argument . from ( [ eq : gnove ] )",
    ", one has that the periods @xmath103 scale , a part logarithmic corrections , as @xmath117 . from ( [ eq : gsette ] ) the growth of @xmath90 during period @xmath103",
    "is estimated to be @xmath118 .",
    "then , we expect @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "we have also performed a second numerical experiment with a stronger coupling @xmath121 and quadratic coupling function @xmath76 .",
    "the initial error is @xmath122 , while all the other parameters in the model are unchanged .",
    "we take an average of @xmath115 runs of @xmath123 steps in order to get a good statistics .",
    "the results are reported in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , where one sees that the error on large scale @xmath124 has a complex behaviour resulting from the combinations of several time - scales , which are now not well separated .",
    "however , even in this case , it is possible to determine an apparent power - law regime for intermediate times .",
    "the system of coupled maps with different chaotic characteristic time teaches us that it is possible to have non trivial time evolutions of _ non - infinitesimal _ perturbations at slowest scale , and that these can be fitted by power laws , although they are actually generated by saturation processes . in this kind of systems , if we are interested in long time predictions , the maximum lyapunov exponent is of little or no importance and one should consider all the time scales present in the system .",
    "in this section we discuss the problem of predictability in a model for the energy cascade in three dimensional fully developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "the model , which is intended to mimic the navier - stokes equations , is defined in the fourier space as follows .",
    "the fourier space is divided into @xmath61 shells labelled by the wavevector modulus @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is an arbitrary constant , each one containing all the wavevector @xmath127 with modulus @xmath128 .",
    "the velocity difference over the length scale @xmath129 is given by a complex variable @xmath130 representing the fourier components of the velocity field .",
    "the evolution is given by the set of @xmath61 ordinary differential equation @xmath131 where @xmath132 is an external forcing , acting on large scale , necessary to have a stationary state , and @xmath21 the viscosity .",
    "the main differences with the navier - stokes equations are :    * \\i ) the wave - vectors and the velocity fields @xmath130 are scalars ; * \\ii ) there are only nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions among shells .",
    "the first point implies that it is not possible to have geometrical structures , all informations on phases being lost .",
    "the second point does not represent a strong limitation as long as the energy cascade in fourier space is local , with exponentially decreasing interactions among shells .",
    "this is rather sensible for three - dimensional turbulence , but not for the two - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the time evolution governed by ( [ eq : sh1])-([eq : sh3 ] ) spends long times around an unstable fixed point given by the kolmogorov law @xmath133 @xcite , it exhibits chaotic behaviour on a strange attractor in the @xmath134 dimensional phase space , with maximum lyapunov exponent roughly proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "the velocity structure functions @xmath136 have non - linear exponents @xmath137 very similar to those of real turbulence @xcite .",
    "our study of predictability is based on the comparison of the temporal evolution of pairs of different realizations of the velocity field , say @xmath130 and @xmath138 .",
    "both fields evolve according to ( [ eq : sh1])-([eq : sh3 ] ) form initial conditions such that :    * \\i ) the energy spectra of @xmath130 and @xmath138 at the initial time are equal ; * \\ii ) @xmath130 and @xmath138 at initial time differ only on small scales , corresponding to wavenumber @xmath139 : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a random number uniformly distribited in the range @xmath142 $ ] .    by changing the value of @xmath143 we can modify the correlation between the two field . the extreme case @xmath144 , i.e. completely uncorrelated variables for @xmath145 , corresponding to the lorenz choice discussed in section [ sec : somer ] .",
    "previous works @xcite investigated the growth of different small perturbations in shell models . here",
    "we want to study this issue for a finite perturbation at initial time .    in the numerical simulation we have taken as the reference field @xmath130 in ( [ eq : vn0 ] ) a solution of ( [ eq : sh1])-([eq : sh3 ] )",
    "obtained from a long simulation starting from a random initial condition .",
    "the forcing @xmath132 was taken constant and equal to @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "the simulations were done mainly for two different systems : ( a ) @xmath148 and @xmath149 ; ( b ) @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we used the leap - frog method of integration with time step @xmath152 in the case ( a ) and @xmath153 in the case ( b ) .",
    "the average is over @xmath154 different realizations of the field @xmath138 .",
    "all the figures will be for the case ( a ) , the case ( b ) being similar .    in order to understand whether intermittency has any effect on the qualitative features",
    ", we also performed a detailed study in terms of closure approximation , where , by construction , one considers averaged quantities neglecting intermittency .",
    "we thus developed the standard eddy damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) approximation @xcite for the shell model ( see appendices [ app : a ] and [ app : b ] ) .    among the various quantities that can be computed , we focused on the error - spectrum at wavevector @xmath155 @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the energy of the two fields and @xmath158 is the overlap energy at scale @xmath159 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] the error energy spectrum @xmath160 is showed at different times for @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we see that at the beginning we have a very fast growth until @xmath160 reaches the saturation ( i.e. @xmath163 ) at large @xmath159 .",
    "then one has a sort of inverse cascade on the error .",
    "this is also the main feature one observes in the case of strong initial perturbation ( figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) .    in order to compare the error growth in the shell model with",
    "the behaviour observed in the toy model of section [ sec : maps ] , we also compute the ( global ) growth of the moments of the difference field , defined as @xmath164^{q/2 }                             \\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] and the large - scale error @xmath165^{1/2 } \\label{eq : lserror}\\ ] ]    figures [ fig : fig6 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] show the growth of the moments of @xmath166 respectively for @xmath161 and @xmath167 .",
    "for the first case we observe at intermediate times a power law behaviour in agreement with the lorenz prediction .",
    "the intermittency produces anomalous scaling , i.e. @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a non increasing function of @xmath170 .",
    "let us note that @xmath171 , as in lorenz prediction where no intermittent effects are taken into account .",
    "in the case of small initial perturbation ( figure [ fig : fig7 ] ) one can recognize an initial exponential growth until the error saturates at small scales .",
    "then we find a kind of power law behaviour .    for a qualitative comparison with the results discussed for the coupled maps , we show in figure [ fig : fig8 ] the growth of @xmath172 .",
    "we can recognize an initial exponential growth driven by the smallest scale ; in later times all the time scales interplay leading to a non simple function which can be misinterpreted as a power law .",
    "the closure approximation for the shell model leads to a qualitaive similar behaviour .",
    "the basic idea of closure is quite straightforward : one writes a reynolds hierarchy for the moments of the shell variables , and truncate the chain of equations at the lowest sensible order .",
    "the full derivation is given below in appendices [ app : a ] and [ app : b ] .",
    "the closure equation thus gives information of the behaviour of @xmath173 and @xmath174 as functions of time .",
    "the results are similar to those obtained by the direct integration ( and ensamble average ) of the shell model , as is evident by the direct comparison of figure [ fig : fig9 ] with figure [ fig : fig4 ] and figure [ fig : fig10 ] with [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the relevant mechanism , at least at a qualitative level , is due to the existence of many characteristic times and not to intermittency effects .",
    "the predictability problem can be formulated in terms of the lyapunov exponent , or the effective lyapunov exponent , only for infinitesimal perturbations . on the other hand in systems with many different characteristic times and finite perturbations",
    "the non - linear effects are very relevant .",
    "direct consequence is that the growth of the perturbation is , a part at very short times , not exponential but rather similar to a power law .",
    "actually it is a sequence of exponentials with varying rates .",
    "this mechanism has an important practical relevance : the predictability time for finite perturbations can be much larger than the inverse of the lyapunov exponent ( [ eq : dx ] ) .",
    "for example , in three dimensional turbulence for a `` physical '' perturbation localized at the initial time at the kolmogorov lenght @xmath15 , @xmath175 , the predictability time is @xmath176 , independent of the reynolds number . on the contrary ,",
    "the predictability time for an infinitesimal perturbation is proportional to the inverse of the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath0 , which grows as a power of the reynolds number .",
    "hence the predictability time decreases for increasing @xmath27 .",
    "these results give a strong indication that despite the presence of strong chaos , realistic situations have relatively long predictability times .",
    "in conclusion we have showed that the concepts of lyapunov exponents , effective lyapunov exponent , kolmogorov entropy give insufficient informations on the chaotic behaviour of extended systems , and it is urgent the identification of new indicators .",
