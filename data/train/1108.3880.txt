    "although the spin - singlet excitations in semiconducting single - walled carbon nanotubes ( s - swcnts ) have been widely investigated both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , the literature on spin - triplet excitations in these systems is relatively sparse .",
    "theoretical predictions of the energy difference between the optically bright spin - singlet exciton and the lowest triplet exciton ( hereafter @xmath3 ) in the s - swcnts vary widely , with estimates of @xmath3 in s - swcnts with diameter @xmath4 nm ranging from @xmath5 @xcite to @xmath6 mev @xcite .",
    "the earliest determination of spin triplet excitations were for s - swcnts with large @xmath7 nm , where @xmath3 are rather small @xcite and precise calculations are difficult .",
    "experimental identification of triplet excitations is made difficult by the occurrence of optically dark spin - singlet excitons below the singlet bright exciton @xcite .",
    "it is significant , however , that early experimental work on s - swcnts with @xmath4 nm found two distinct groups of optically dark excitons @xcite , redshifted relative to the singlet bright exciton by @xmath8 mev and 100 - 130 mev , respectively , a point we come back to later .",
    "more recent careful measurements have determined the energy locations of the lowest triplet excitons in several s - swcnts with diameters close to 1 nm @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xmath3 are different from both sets of theoretical predictions and are intermediate in magnitude ( see below ) .",
    "in contrast to nanotubes , where considerable photophysical studies have been carried out , the existing literature on the photophysics of graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) is largely theoretical in nature @xcite .",
    "discussions here have been limited to spin - singlet excitations only .",
    "the sparseness of the literature on triplet excitations is surprising , since even though the spin - selection rule requires that optical excitations from the singlet ground state occur only to singlet excited states , triplet excitations can play strong indirect roles in optoelectronic applications . in the context of light emitting diodes with molecular or polymeric @xmath2-conjugated systems as the active materials , for example ,",
    "the relative yields of light emissive singlet excitons versus nonemissive triplet excitons in electroluminescence is a topic of strong interest @xcite .",
    "the formation rates of the singlet and triplet excitons depend strongly on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "similar discussions are ongoing also in the area of organic photovoltaics ; the possibility of harvesting longlived triplet excitons that are reached from the singlet optical exciton via _ intersystem crossing _ ( isc ) @xcite or _ singlet fission _ @xcite are being actively investigated .",
    "the efficiencies of both isc and fission depend on @xmath3 .",
    "thorough investigation of @xmath3 and the nature of the spin - triplet excitations in the carbon nanostructures is thus called for .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the results of theoretical calculations of triplet excitations in several s - swcnts and armchair gnrs ( agnrs ) within a molecular correlated - electron model .",
    "we compare these results with those for poly(para - phenylenevinylene ) ( ppv ) for which experimental results are known @xcite .",
    "our findings reveal that there is a _ qualitative _ change in the triplet state wave function in agnrs with increasing width ; nanoribbons with widths as narrow as 2.5 times the graphene lattice vector already exhibit small @xmath3 .",
    "coulomb correlation effects on the honeycomb lattice appear to be different from those in one - dimensional chainlike systems .",
    "similar behavior as agnrs for the triplet state wave function is also found in s - swcnts with increasing diameter .",

    "we assume hydrogenation of the edge carbon atoms in agnrs and take uniform @xmath20 ev . in real systems",
    ", the site energies of the edge carbon atoms and hopping integrals linking them are expected to be slightly different from the corresponding quantities for the carbon atoms near the centers of the nanoribbons . however",
    ", we expect this effect to contribute weakly to the relatively large difference in @xmath3 between ppv and agnrs ( see below ) . for the s - swcnts , based on earlier work ,",

    "the zigzag s - swcnts were chosen because of the simplicity of performing calculations for these with a very large number of unit cells .",
    "previous experience has shown that energy difference in nanotubes depend primarily on diameters @xmath41 and relatively weakly on chiralities .",
    "thus the calculated @xmath3 for the zigzag nanotubes may be considered representative for all nanotubes with diameters that are close .",
    "in contrast to the zigzag s - swcnts , experimental results for @xmath3 are available for the @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath37 nanotubes . we show below that our calculated results for both the spin - singlet bright exciton and the lowest spin - triplet exciton are in excellent agreement with experiments in these cases .",
    "while the triplet subspace of the two remaining chiral s - swcnts in our list , @xmath34 and @xmath36 , have not been studied experimentally yet , their photophysics has been widely investigated in the past .",
    "the long exciton lifetime in the @xmath34 s - swcnt has allowed experimental estimation of the size and the mobility of the optical singlet exciton @xcite .",
    "our calculated singlet exciton size compares very favorably with the experimental value .",
    "our predicted theoretical results for triplet excitations can thus be compared against future experiments in the @xmath34 and @xmath36 s - swcnts .",
    "the agnrs we have chosen are obtained by unrolling our zigzag nanotubes after cutting them along their translational vectors .    as in previous works @xcite ,",
    "our calculations for the s - swcnts and agnrs are done with open boundary condition . for the zigzag s - swcnts , our calculations are for 50 unit cells with @xmath42 2000 carbon atoms in each case . for the chiral s - swcnts the number of unit cells we retain is smaller , but the number of carbon atoms is comparable ; in all cases , we retain larger than 2000 carbon atoms .",
    "furthermore , for each of the three s - swcnts for which experimental results are available , we have done careful finite - size analysis to confirm that our calculated energies have converged to within a few percent .",
    "calculations for the agnrs are for 40 unit cells .",
    "tractable approximate approaches to the many - body ppp hamiltonian are necessary to determine the excitation energies of large systems . as discussed in the context of singlet excitations @xcite , we use the single configuration interaction ( sci ) approximation , which involves diagonalization of the ppp hamiltonian in the space of single excitations from the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state .",
    "the excitation of a single electron from the ground state can give either the singlet or triplet electron - hole pair or exciton .",
    "indirect exchange within eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) differentiates between the two spin states .",
    "in table  [ table1 ] , we have given our calculated singlet and triplet exiton energies ( hereafter @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ) . in the case of the s - swcnts , there occur singlet dark excitons below the optical bright exciton .",

    "[ table1 ] , @xmath43 corresponds to the singlet bright exciton and @xmath44 to the _ lowest _ triplet exciton .",
    "thus in s - swcnts , there occur several dark singlet and triplet excitons between these two states .",
    "we have also included in table  [ table1 ] the calculated singlet exciton binding energies ( hereafter @xmath45 ) , corresponding to the difference in energy between the lowest hf continuum within sci and the singlet exciton @xcite . quantitative agreement between the calculated @xmath43 and @xmath45 , and their experimental estimates @xcite in s - swcnts",
    "have been pointed out earlier @xcite .",
    "we therefore compare theory and experiments here only for the s - swcnts for which triplet energies are available .",
    "for ppv , the calculated @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ev are to be compared against experimental quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ev , respectively @xcite . the experimental triplet exciton energies for the @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 s - swcnts in table i were obtained from emissions from triplet states that became optically active upon pulsed - laser irradiation @xcite or hydrogen absorption @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the emissions are from the lowest triplet exciton within the triplet manifold @xcite .",
    "excellent agreement between theory and experiments is seen in all three cases .",
    "the most striking aspect of the results in table  [ table1 ] is the very small @xmath3 in the s - swcnts and the agnrs , nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that in ppv .",
    "we do not find the simple @xmath52 diameter dependence of @xmath3 suggested previously @xcite .",
    "for each of the chiral s - swcnts in table  [ table1 ] , our results are for the longest nanotubes that were computationally accessible . whether or not convergence in energies has been reached is clearly an important issue , both from the perspective of comparisons to experiments and because of the seemingly surprising difference between s - swcnts and ppv in the triplet sector , given that in the singlet sector @xmath45 in s - swcnts is smaller than that of ppv by only about a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "we have therefore done careful finite - size analysis for the three s - swcnts for which experimental results are available for both the singlet bright exciton and the triplet exciton . in table",
    "[ table2 ] , we have shown these results .",
    "convergence to a few percent or less in both @xmath54 and @xmath55 gives us confidence about our results in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "comparing our results for the @xmath36 s - swcnt with that in ref .  , we see that the reason for the large @xmath3 found in that work lied not in the limitation to two unit cells , but the relatively large difference between the calculated spin - singlet exciton energy there and the experimental value .    in order to understand physically the origin of the difference between ppv on the one hand and s - swcnts and agnrs on the other , we have done careful wave function analyses .",
    "the amplitude for an electron located at site @xmath13 in real space with a hole located at site @xmath24 within a bound electron - hole exciton is @xmath56 with @xmath57 the sci singlet ( triplet ) exciton wave function and @xmath58 the hf ground - state wave function @xcite . in eq .",

    "each point @xmath13 on the diagonal gives the probability of finding the electron and the hole on the same location , and vertical displacements from the diagonal points @xmath13 gives the probability of finding a hole at some @xmath61 , with the electron fixed at @xmath13 .",
    "giving multiple @xmath13 becomes necessary because of the open boundary condition we have chosen .",
    "microscopic details such as electron - hole separations within a unit cell can not be obtained from the figure , which , however , does give a coarse - grained comparison between singlet and triplet excitons .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] indicates that the triplet exciton in ppv exhibits a significantly more localized probability density compared to the singlet exciton .",

    "the root mean square ( rms ) electron - hole separation ( `` exciton size '' ) @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) gives the location of the electron ( hole ) , is thus significantly different for singlet and triplet excitons ( @xmath65 , see fig .",

    "the ( 21,1 ) agnr is obtained by `` unrolling '' the ( 11,0 ) nt , while the ( 7,6 ) nt has a diameter close to that of the ( 11,0 ) nt .",

    "the probability density patterns are wider for all three carbon nanostructures compared to ppv , and are nearly the same for spin - singlet and triplet excitons .",
    "both of these indicate some fundamental difference between the wave functions , in particular the triplet wave functions , in @xmath2-conjugated polymers versus the carbon nanostructures .",
    "the wider probability dispersion in the agnr indicates greater electron - hole separation in the exciton wave functions here , presumably a consequence of partial two - dimensionality , as the exciton acquires greater width within the same unit cell .",
    "the @xmath66 for the ( 7,6 ) nt , with very large unit cells is particularly interesting .",
    "each bright square within the checkerboard pattern in figures  [ f2](e ) and ( f ) corresponds to @xmath13 and @xmath24 within the same unit cell .",
    "the overall pattern indicates exciton wave functions delocalized over the cylinder within a unit cell , even as the unit cells themselves are coupled one dimensionally ( justifying partly the characterization of nts as `` quasi - one - dimensional '' ) .",
    "our results for _ other chiral s - swcnts _ also exhibit similar checkerboard patterns within the unit cell for @xmath66 .",
    "similar structure should be true also in the ( 11,0 ) zigzag nt , except that because of the much smaller unit cell size - 44 carbon atoms - this is not visible on the scale of fig .",

    ", @xmath79 ev in s - swcnts with @xmath80 nm . @xmath3s even smaller than ours for s - swcnts of similar diameters were calculated in refs .   and .",
    "the smaller @xmath3 was justified on the basis of the argument that it should be comparable to the energy splitting between optically bright and dark singlet longitudinal excitons , which is , indeed , smaller than our @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these authors claimed that the bright - dark spin singlet exciton splitting is determined by the same exchange energy that gives the singlet - triplet splitting , and hence the two quantities should be comparable .",
    "this argument is not correct however .",
    "bright - dark exciton splitting requires _",
    "pairs _ of occupied orbitals ( labeled , say , 1 and 2 ) and unoccupied orbitals ( 1@xmath81 and 2@xmath81 ) , such that within one - electron theory the optically allowed excited states @xmath82 and @xmath83 are nearly degenerate . in the presence of many - electron interactions that give nonzero matrix elements between these excited configurations new eigenstates",
    "@xmath84 are obtained of which one is optically bright and the other dark @xcite .",
    "thus unlike in the exchange process where only two orbitals and two electrons are involved , permutation of the coordinates of pairs of electrons are not involved in the splitting behind the bright and dark excitons .",
    "the latter is thus driven by direct coulomb interactions , as has also been emphasized by others @xcite .",
    "both the direct and the exchange coulomb interactions vary as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the exciton radius . the bright - dark splitting is small for the longitudinal excitons with large radii , but the same mechanism is behind the splitting of bright and dark _ transverse _ excitons in s - swcnts @xcite and ppv @xcite , where because of the short radii of the transverse excitons , the coulomb matrix elements are large and so are the splittings .",
    "the above argument justifies @xmath3 larger than the singlet bright - dark separation , as the exciton radii are smaller for the triplet than for the singlet exciton . in view of this and the results of table  [ table1 ] , we then arrive at the following interpretation of the experiments of ref .  : the optically dark states @xmath8 mev below the bright exciton are spin singlet , while the ones @xmath87 below are spin triplets .",
    "this interpretation agrees with our results for the triplets in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "understanding the small @xmath3 in spite of the relatively large @xmath45 , in comparison to ppv , requires going through a somewhat more complicated discussion .",
    "the ppp hamiltonian reduces in the strong - coupling limit to a hubbard hamiltonian [ @xmath88 limit of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ] with effective @xmath17 , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "the correlated - electron wave function of @xmath2-conjugated polymers corresponds to that of a mott - hubbard semiconductor , since in one dimension the critical @xmath17 ( hereafter @xmath91 ) for metal - insulator transition within the simple hubbard model is arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "this implies that the ground state is dominated by covalent valence bond diagrams with only singly occupied sites @xcite . _",
    "the important point now is that the nature of the ground - state wave function and of the lowest spin triplet states are related .",
    "_ thus the lowest triplet states in one dimension are also covalent , while the optical state consists of ionic valence bond diagrams @xcite .",
    "this is why of course @xmath3 in @xmath2-conjugated polymers is large .",
    "in contrast to one dimension , recent theoretical work has shown that in the graphene lattice @xmath91 is rather large , @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "graphene is a semimetal since @xmath93 within the ppp model is smaller than this @xmath91 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath91 becomes nonzero for nanoribbons with finite width @xmath94 , with @xmath91 rising gradually with width @xmath95 . for nanoribbons that are metallic within one - electron theory and",
    "have @xmath95 then the ground - state wave function is no longer covalent but has strong admixing with ionic configurations with double occupancies .",
    "we _ speculate _ that a similar effect occurs in _ semiconducting _ nanoribbons with @xmath95 , where the ground - state wave function begins to resemble that of a conventional semiconductor rather than a mott - hubbard semiconductor .",
    "this would also mean that the ground state is no longer covalent ; furthermore , in conventional semiconductors , the singlet optical state and the triplet are both ionic and @xmath3 is small .",
    "our calculations in fig .",

    "<S> we show that the energy differences between the lowest optical singlet exciton and the lowest triplet exciton in semiconducting single - walled carbon nanotubes with diameter @xmath0 nm and graphene nanoribbons with widths @xmath1 nm are an order of magnitude smaller than in the @xmath2-conjugated polymer poly(para - phenylenevinylene ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated energy gaps between the singlet and triplet excitons are in excellent agreement with the measured values in three different nanotubes with diameters close to 1 nm . the spatial extent of the triplet exciton is nearly the same as that of the singlet exciton in wide nanotubes and nanoribbons , in contrast to that in @xmath2-conjugated polymers , in which the triplet exciton exhibits strong spatial confinement . weakly confined behavior of the triplet state begins in nanoribbons with widths as narrow as 2.5 times the graphene unit lattice vector . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible consequences of the small singlet - triplet energy difference in the carbon nanostructures on device applications .    </S>",
