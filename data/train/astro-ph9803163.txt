    "the association of universities for research in astronomy ( aura ) , with nasa support , recently appointed a committee to `` study possible missions and programs for uv - optical - ir astronomy in space for the first decades of the twenty - first century . ''",
    "the report urged the development of a general - purpose , near - infrared observatory equipped with a passively cooled primary mirror ( @xmath0  k ) with a minimum diameter of 4 meters ( dressler 1996 ) . to enhance its performance ,",
    "the report recommended that the observatory be placed as far from the earth - moon system as possible to reduce stray light and to maintain the telescope s relatively low temperature .",
    "with such a facility , it should be possible to learn in detail how galaxies formed , measure the large - scale curvature of space - time by measuring distant standard - candles , trace the chemical evolution of galaxies , and study nearby stars and star - forming regions for signs of planetary systems . a detailed discussion of the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) and its scientific potential given by stockman ( 1997 ) .",
    "for ngst to attain these scientific objectives , it must have an instrument which is designed to execute panchromatic observations over the critical 115 @xmath1 m wavelength range of the faintest detectable objects . with njy sensitivity levels attainable at near - infrared ( 15 @xmath1 m ) ( nir ) and mid - infrared ( 515@xmath1 m ) ( mir ) wavelengths",
    ", ngst will be able to study the well - calibrated rest - frame optical diagnostics in distant ( @xmath2 ) galaxies , thus probing for the first time , their stellar content , star - formation history and nuclear activity . at the longer wavelengths",
    ", ngst can investigate these properties in @xmath3 galaxies using diagnostics that are unaffected by dust extinction and reddening , and also study the dust properties directly .    at the flux limits characteristic of ngst ,",
    "the confusion limit is likely to be approached , with virtually every pixel having significant information ( e.g. , by extrapolation from counts in the hubble deep field ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) ) . as a result , one of the best ways to maximize the scientific output from ngst is to provide a wide - field imaging spectrograph that is efficient in this limit .",
    "an imaging fourier transform spectrometer ( ifts ) provides these capabilities in a low - cost , high throughput , compact design .",
    "it provides the only efficient means of conducting _ unbiased _ spectroscopic surveys of the high-@xmath4 universe , i.e. , without object preselection ( e.g. , using broad band colors ) and without the restrictions imposed by spectrometer slit geometry and placement .",
    "an ifts also allows spectroscopy over a wide bandpass , affords flexibility in choice of resolution , is easy to calibrate , and is ideal for wide - field spectroscopic surveys .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and bennett , carter , & fields ( 1995 ) describe the operating principles of imaging fourier transform spectrographs and compare their performance with alternative imaging spectrometers .",
    "a comprehensive review of the application of interferometers and the techniques of fourier spectroscopy to astrophysical problems is given by ridgway & brault ( 1984 ) , and a recent summary of the field , including a description of an astronomical ifts is given by maillard ( 1995 ) .",
    "spaceborne fourier transform spectrometers have been responsible for spectacular results in the fields of planetary exploration and cosmology .",
    "infrared ft spectrometers developed at the goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) flew on board the mariner 9 mission to mars , and were carried to the outer planets by the voyager spacecraft ( hanel et al .",
    "the instruments provided superb data revealing , for the first time , the composition of the atmospheres of the giant gaseous planets ( e.g. jupiter , hanel et al .",
    "the composite infrared spectrometer ( cirs ) , currently traveling to saturn onboard the cassini spacecraft , is another instrument developed at gsfc .",
    "cirs is the first step towards an imaging fts as it has a linear array of detectors , rather than a single element detector , in order to map the temperature and composition of the atmospheres of saturn and titan as a function of altitude during limb soundings .",
    "( kunde et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the definitive measurement of the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) was one of the most dramatic experimental measurements of this decade ( mather et al .",
    "1990 ; gush , halpern & wishnow 1990 ) . the firas instrument onboard the nasa satellite cobe which first performed this measurement , and the cobra rocket experiment conducted by the university of british columbia which confirmed it a few months later , were both liquid - helium cooled , differential fourier transform spectrometers .",
    "these instruments used a dual - input , dual - output configuration where one input viewed the sky and the other viewed a blackbody calibrator ( mather , fixen & shafer 1993 ; gush & halpern 1992 ) .",
    "absolute photometric measurements were obtained by reference to the blackbody calibrator , and the cmbr was observed to have an undistorted planck spectrum corresponding to a temperature of @xmath5 k ( fixen et al .",
    "the ifts proposed here can be thought of as an extension of these experiments where focal plane detector arrays yield simultaneous imaging and spectral information .    in the next decade",
    ", missions such as wire , axaf , and sirtf will expand astrophysical horizons , possibly unveiling entirely new populations of objects .",
    "an ifts offers the flexibility ( e.g. , spectral resolution ) that may prove essential in investigating the nature of these sources .",
    "due to its flexibility and its ability to provide simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy of every object in the field of view ( fov ) , an ifts is a _ necessary _ instrument for the ngst mission .",
    "an ifts ( fig . [ fts ] ) is axis - symmetric , and the optical path difference ( opd ) is the same for all the points of the image with the same angle of incidence from the axis of the interferometer .",
    "hence , the fov is circular . on the object side ,",
    "an entrance collimator illuminates the interferometer with parallel light .",
    "the interfering beams are collected by the output camera , creating a stigmatic relation between the object and image planes . by placing a detector array in the output focal plane the entrance field",
    "is imaged on the array and each pixel works as a single detector matched to a point on the sky .",
    "retrieving spectral information involves recording the interferogram generated by the source imaged onto the focal plane array ( fpa ) .",
    "the opd is scanned in discrete steps since fpas are integrating detectors .",
    "scanning in this way generates a data cube of two - dimensional interferograms .",
    "the signal from the same pixel in each frame forms an independent interferogram .",
    "these interferograms are fourier transformed individually yielding a spectral data cube composed of the same spatial elements as the image .",
    "the features of an ifts which make it the instrument of choice for ngst are efficiency , flexibility , and compactness .",
    "the most compelling reason for choosing an ifts is that in the dual port design ( see fig .",
    "[ optical - layout ] ) virtually every photon collected by the telescope is directed towards the focal plane for detection .",
    "other solutions are inefficient , inflexible , and wasteful of mass , power , and volume .",
    "cameras equipped with filters admit only a restricted bandpass at low spectral resolution . to compete with the spectral multiplex advantage of an ifts , a camera system needs multiple dichroics and fpas .",
    "the additional mass and thermal load is a severe penalty .",
    "classical dispersive spectrographs have slit losses , grating inefficiencies due to light lost in unwanted orders , and limited free spectral range ( the same is true for a fabry - perot ) . _",
    "an ifts acquires full bandpass imaging simultaneously with higher spectral resolution data .",
    "_ therefore , a high snr broad - band image always accompanies full spectral sampling of the fov with no penalty in integration time .",
    "an ifts is a true imaging spectrograph and measures a spectrum for every pixel in the fov .",
    "it is not necessary to choose which regions in the image are most deserving of spectroscopic analysis .",
    "overheads are eliminated because no additional observing time is needed for imaging prior to object selection , and there is no delay in positioning slit masks , fibers , or image slicing micro - mirrors .",
    "thus , an ifts will produce a rich scientific legacy with tremendous potential for serendipity .",
    "table [ capabilities ] details the capabilities of a putative ifts suitable for ngst .",
    "we use the instrument described by this table to illustrate the potential of an ifts .",
    "two points in table [ capabilities ] must be stressed : 1 ) an ifts is spectrally multiplexed , therefore all spectral channels are obtained simultaneously within the stated integration time .",
    "2 ) the free spectral range of an ifts is limited only by the band - pass filter and the detector response .",
    "consequently , the usual definition of resolution , @xmath6 , is of limited use .",
    "it is conventional to scan the opd of an ifts in equal steps so that the resolution is constant in wavenumber , @xmath7",
    ". thus , we use @xmath8 to denote the number of spectral channels .",
    "for example , in the nir with a 1 - 5 @xmath1 m band - pass , @xmath9 means that @xmath10  @xmath11 , and a scan yields 5 bands centered 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.7 , 2.3 , & 3.6 @xmath1 m .    lll design & dual - port & dual - port + bandpass & 1 - 5 @xmath1 m & 5 - 15 @xmath1 m + resolution & 1 @xmath11 & 1 @xmath11 + fov & @xmath12 & @xmath13",

    "an ifts has no loss of light or spatial information because there is no slit , hence an ifts is perfectly adapted to doing multi - object spectroscopy in crowded or confusion limited fields .",
    "a ifts uses every photon whereas traditional cameras and spectrographs throw away photons ( either spectrally with a filter or spatially with a slit ) , so at a very fundamental level an ifts is superior . on blaze , a good grating is 80% efficient , but averaged over the free spectral range this drops to about 65% .",
    "an ifts is not optimized for single - object spectroscopy because the broad - band photon shot noise is associated with every frame in the interferogram .",
    "hence , for a single object a slit spectrograph is @xmath20 times faster than an ifts of the same resolution in background limited operation , where @xmath21 is the grating efficiency averaged over the blaze function , and @xmath22 is the slit loss , where typically the product @xmath23 . this disadvantage is more than compensated for by the spatial - multiplexing capability of an ifts .",
    "a typical deep background limited exposure of an ifts will reach @xmath24 , snr=10 and will contain at least 3500 and possibly , depending on cosmology , up to 11,000 , objects per field ( see fig .",
    "[ number - counts ] ) .",
    "a grating spectrograph with a fiber feed or multi - slit capability can perhaps record spectra for only a few percent of these objects at a time , requiring hundreds of pointings to make an unbiased survey of a single field , as opposed to the single ifts imaging - cum - spectroscopic observation .",
    "an ifts is tolerant of detector noise because it always operates under photon limited conditions due to the broad spectral bandpass transmitted to the fpa .",
    "this is illustrated in table [ readoutexamples ] which shows a break - down of the noise sources in the nir and mir channels corresponding to the performance listed in table [ capabilities ] .",
    "table [ readoutexamples ] also shows that the read - out rates required to avoid saturation are modest ( @xmath25  mhz ) , since typical well depths for nir insb or hgcdte arrays are a few @xmath26 e@xmath27 and @xmath28 e@xmath27 for mir si : as arrays .",

    "the ifts instruments liftirs and hiris are routinely operated with ambient temperature optics in the 8 - 14 @xmath1 m band ( bennett et al .",
    "1995 ) , whereas dispersive spectrometers , like sebass ( bennett , _ private communication _ ) , operating in the same spectral region must have the slit and all following optics cooled far below ambient temperatures .",
    "the reason is that in a dispersive spectrometer the thermal emission of all the elements and optics downstream of the slit reach the detector at full spectral range determined by the bandpass limiting element at or near the coldstop , whereas only the narrow spectral range corresponding to the width of a spectral channel for the signals of interest reach the detector pixels .",
    "for the ifts , both the signals of interest and the thermal emission are seen over the full spectral range determined by the bandpass limiting filter , and thus it is only necessary that the thermal emission of the optical elements along the optic axis integrated over the bandpass of interest , either 1 - 5 @xmath1 m or 5 - 15 @xmath1 m , be somewhat less than that of the integral of the zodiacal foreground , telescope emission , and source signal level integrated over the same broad spectral region .",
    "an ifts is potentially immune to cosmic ray hits because the `` energy '' of a single upset pixel in one opd frame appears as a sinusoidal signal divided among all bins in the spectral transform of the interferogram for that pixel .",
    "we can ignore cosmic ray hits only if the counts generated are at or below our noise level .",
    "a minimum ionizing cosmic ray proton ( @xmath33 gev ) has ionization losses of @xmath34 ev @xmath1m@xmath35 in si . assuming that 3.6 ev is required to produce an electron - hole pair ,",
    "a cosmic ray will yield at least a few thousand events , since typical pixels have sensitive layers that are tens of @xmath1 m thick .",
    "we would obtain similar number for a hybrid device , i.e. , insb or hgcdte on a si multiplexer .",
    "if a cosmic ray hit produces a significant signal in a certain number of pixels , those pixels must be `` repaired '' by interpolating the interferogram between the previous few `` good '' frames , and the following few `` good '' frames which are not contaminated by cosmic ray hits .",
    "the same sort of processing would be needed for any other system as well , be it an imager or a spectrometer .",
    "comparison with the noise sources listed in table [ readoutexamples ] indicates that cosmic ray hits will have to be repaired in the nir channel , while the mir channel will be more tolerant .    a dual port design ( fig .",
    "[ optical - layout ] ) delivers the complementary symmetric and antisymmetric interferograms . in this dual - input dual - output design , the field of the complementary input ( labeled `` calibration input '' in fig .",
    "[ optical - layout ] ) is also imaged and superimposed on each image of the `` primary input '' .",
    "this property is often used to cancel the sky emission . in operation , when observing the sky in the primary input , the secondary input would be fed with a cold blackbody load , having negligible radiance .",
    "the final interferogram is constructed from the difference between the two outputs ( which is therefore also immune to common mode electrical noise ) while the normalized ratio reveals systematic variation due to detector drifts .",
    "the wavelength scale and the instrumental line shape ( a @xmath36 function if there is no apodizing ) are precisely determined and are independent of wavelength .",
    "absolute wavelength calibration is done by counting fringes of an optical single - mode laser . compared to a dispersive system",
    "the broad - band operation of an ifts means that there are @xmath8 times more photons for flat fielding and determining signal - dependent gain ( linearity ) .",
    "hence , high signal - to - noise calibration images can be acquired faster or with lower power internal sources .",
    "spatial multiplexing renders the performance of an ifts equal to that of an ideal multi - slit spectrograph ( bennett 1995 ) .",
    "hence , even if we ignore slit losses and blaze inefficiency the other advantages of an ifts are overwhelming . the spectral resolution can be varied arbitrarily from the coarsest case of a small number of bands up to a spectral resolution limit determined only by the maximum opd characteristic of the instrument .",
    "the proposed instrument has a maximum opd of 1 cm and hence can operate over a range of resolutions from full band up to @xmath8=8000 in the nir    the spectral resolution limit , @xmath37 , of a michelson interferometer is    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the angular diameter of the fov , @xmath40 is the diameter of the beam splitter , and @xmath41 the telescope primary mirror diameter ( e.g. , jacquinot 1954 ; maillard 1995 ) .",
    "classically , @xmath39 refers to the entire field , but in the case of an ifts , @xmath39 is the fov of an on - axis pixel .    although convenient if a single fringe fills the fpa , just as with imaging fabry - perots , there is no reason why each pixel should record the same apparent wavenumber .",
    "fringes crowd together with increasing field angle .",
    "therefore , the need to maintain modulation efficiency over the entire field of view requires that the spatial separation of the fringes at the edge of the fpa , for a given retardance , is significantly greater than the pixel spacing .",
    "if @xmath42 is the opd for a normally incident beam with wavenumber @xmath7 , and @xmath43 is the field angle of off - axis rays at the beam splitter , then the path difference at @xmath43 is @xmath44 and the apparent wavenumber of this beam is    @xmath45    the angles @xmath43 and @xmath39 are related by the angular magnification , @xmath46 . if @xmath47 is the angular width , also at the beam splitter , corresponding to a single pixel , the spectral resolution limit for off - axis points can be found by differentiating eq ( 2 ) ,    @xmath48    fig .",
    "[ pixel_fov ] shows the pixel size for a given field of view for a range of resolutions .",
    "for example , for an 8  m diameter primary aperture and a beam splitter of diameter 10  cm , a fov of @xmath12 , and a pixel size of @xmath14 , the corresponding angles at a beam splitter of diameter 10  cm are @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , leading to a resolution limit of @xmath51 .",
    "since this resolution is two orders of magnitude greater than we are proposing , it is clear that spectral resolution is not the principal factor determining pixel size .",
    "an alternative way to view this constraint is that @xmath40 , i.e. , the size of the optics , is determined not by spectral resolution , but by the requirement that there be no vignetting over the field of view .",
    "thus , the optics for an ifts are similar to that of a simple re - imaging camera , and are smaller and slower than those of an equivalent dispersive spectrograph .",
    "we therefore have broad freedom to choose the pixel size by trading off field of view and spatial sampling . given that nir arrays of @xmath52 pixels are likely to be available in the near future , a pixel size of @xmath14 yields a @xmath53 field of view and @xmath54 sampling at 4 @xmath1 m .",
    "this choice of pixel size does not preclude diffraction limited imaging at shorter wavelengths .",
    "if pixels have sharp boundaries , then it is possible to extract information at spatial frequencies above the cut - off in the pixel - sampling modulation transfer function if the spacecraft can offset and track at the sub - pixel level ( cf .",
    "fruchter and hook 1998 ) .",
    "similar reasoning suggests @xmath15 pixels would be a satisfactory compromise for the mir channel .",
    "an ifts views all frequencies in its pass band simultaneously , but multiplexes them by modulating each optical frequency in the source at an `` acoustic '' frequency proportional to the optical frequency .",
    "near the zero phase difference point of the interferometer , assuming an ideal beamsplitter , full intensity is transmitted through one port of a dual port interferometer , and no intensity through the other . for reasonably high resolution , most of the points in the interferogram are acquired away from the centerburst , and thus , to a good approximation , the average intensity transmitted through _ each port _ is 50% of the source intensity . in the time domain ,",
    "the average signal photoelectron count rate for a dual - port interferometer is    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the source photon rate per unit wavenumber , @xmath57 is the system efficiency , including the telescope , collimator , beam - splitter , and camera throughput and the detector qe . the integral is taken over the full bandpass of the system .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the time domain is given , on average , by    @xmath58^{1/2 } } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the noise consists of photon shot noise from source and background photon rate , @xmath59 , dark current @xmath60 , and read noise , @xmath61 .",
    "the integration time per opd step is @xmath30 .",
    "the factor of two in dark and read noise occurs because of the twin fpas required for a dual - port instrument .",
    "the relation between the signal to noise ratio in the spectral domain to the signal to noise ratio in the temporal domain can most easily be derived using parseval s theorem .",
    "if there are @xmath62 frames in the interferogram the relation between the noise level in the spectral domain , @xmath63 , to the noise in the time domain , @xmath64 , assuming that it is approximately white is given by    @xmath65    hence , the snr in the frequency domain is    @xmath66    where the last equality is obtained under the assumption of a white spectrum extending over @xmath8 spectral channels .",
    "the snr for an ifts at any given resolution simply scales as @xmath67 per spectral channel .",
    "for all snr calculations ( table [ capabilities ] and numbers in  [ science ] ) we have assumed a dual - port design on a 8-m telescope and @xmath68 .",
    "the background consists of zodiacal light at 1 au and thermal emission from the telescope .",
    "the internal background within the ifts is orders of magnitude lower than the external background because we expect that the ifts optics and detectors will operate in the same low temperature ( @xmath69 30  k ) environment within the ngst instrument bay .",
    "therefore the internal background has been neglected .",
    "we have used the emission measured at the ecliptic pole ( hauser et al .",
    "1984 ) , and include thermal background from the telescope optics , assuming @xmath70  k and an emissivity of @xmath71 .",
    "the snr results simulate optimal extraction of synthetic aperture photometry of a point source from a digital image .",
    "the size of the aperture which maximizes the snr depends on the dominant noise source and the wavelength , and ranges between @xmath72 , i.e. , the angular diameter which encircles 50% of the light , and @xmath73 .",
    "the instrument performance depends on the detector dark current and read noise . for the nir channel",
    "we assume a dark current of 0.03 e  s@xmath35 and an rms read noise of 5 e@xmath27 [ with fowler sampling , ( fowler & gatley 1990 ) ] . for the mir channel",
    "we assume a dark current of 1 e@xmath27  s@xmath35 and an rms read noise of 5 e@xmath27 .",
    "this performance is optimistic , but not unrealistic given projected detector development for ngst ( bely & mccreight 1996 ) .",
    "the versatility , broad wavelength coverage , and spatial multiplexing capability of an ifts renders it well suited to executing a large space telescope s broad range of science goals . in this section",
    ", we discuss the applications of an ifts which are representative of the many programs that can be carried out with this instrument .",
    "since the rest - frame optical emission of distant galaxies is redshifted to the nir , broad - band , wide - field ir imaging surveys are essential to the study of their formation , early evolution , and merging history .",
    "the nir colors synthesized from a low resolution 5 spectral channel ifts survey offer excellent separation of galaxy type and redshift throughout the range @xmath74 to @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ color_color ] ) .",
    "thus , high-@xmath4 galaxies can be picked out from foreground objects , and a preliminary determination of their stellar populations made .",
    "an ifts provides this capability along with the flexibility to conduct much higher spectral resolution surveys .",
    "-1.8 in    with an integration time of @xmath26 s per @xmath53 fov , an ifts will obtain a snr=5 - 15 at the 1 njy flux level in each of the 5 spectral channels , and measure dwarf ( rest - frame @xmath76 ) star forming irregular galaxies at @xmath77 at a snr=40 , and detect lmc - like star - forming systems or super star - clusters which might be representative of proto - globular clusters forming stars at 1 @xmath78  yr@xmath35 for 25 myr out to @xmath79 , and , if they exist , dwarf ellipticals ( @xmath80 ) to @xmath81 ( fig .",

    "hence , in this mode , an ifts can probe the evolution of the luminosity function as a function of morphological type and stellar content , and thereby determine the spectral and merging history of galaxies .",

    "for example , the intrinsic star - formation rates in the @xmath4=2.53.5 lyman drop galaxies are likely to be @xmath91  factors of a few above the rates estimated from their rest - frame 1500  luminosity ( steidel et al .",

    "population synthesis modeling of the observed spectra can yield even more accurate measures of the relative ages and stellar content of galaxy samples , and potentially provide an estimate for the first epoch of galaxy formation and a lower limit to the age of the universe .      while only one third of the bolometric luminosity of local galaxies is radiated in the ir ( soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) ,",
    "there is growing evidence that this fraction is actually increasing with redshift .",
    "the deepest counts available from iras at 60 @xmath1 m ( hacking & houck 1987 ) , which correspond to an average redshift of about 0.2 ( ashby et al . 1996 ) , already suggest some evolution of the ir emission in the universe .",
    "a deep survey with the iso at 15 @xmath1 m has discovered a few objects at @xmath4=0.5 - 1 with star formation rates much higher than deduced from the optical ( rowan - robinson et al .",

    "this has led to claims that the primary epoch of star formation in the universe has been seen .",
    "however , the conversion of uv luminosities into star formation rates must take into account a correction for the luminosity fraction absorbed by the dust which is generally associated with young stars .",
    "since this correction is uncertain for high redshift galaxies , the star formation rates currently deduced from optical surveys alone might be substantially underestimated ( calzetti 1997 ) . for high redshift galaxies , the only current direct observational constraint is set by the recent detection of the cosmic far - ir background built up from the accumulated ir light of faint galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "the far - ir and sub - mm background light detected by cobe implies a star formation rate which is a factor of two above that inferred from optical galaxies in the hubble deep field ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; schlegel et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "mid - ir low resolution spectroscopy can be used to search for dusty , star forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "[ midir - plot ] shows a sequence of redshifted spectra representing an ultraluminous ( @xmath98 ) iras galaxy such as arp  220 , which is a prototype for a deeply embedded starburst ( guiderdoni et al .",
    "( arp  220 is not an agn , as recent iso spectroscopy and vlbi observations show ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ; smith , lonsdale , & lonsdale 1998 ) . )",
    "the most prominent feature in these spectra is 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission which is shifted to the mir band .",
    "low resolution mir spectral scans will be exquisitely sensitive to this broad emission feature , and therefore provide a sensitive way to search for deeply extincted star - formation at high-@xmath4 .",
    "for example , sirtf will survey 1 square degree in the far - ir to a flux level of about 100 @xmath1jy to study the cosmological evolution of these sources .",
    "this detection threshold is sufficient to find about 200 ultraluminous ir galaxies to @xmath99 .",
    "a ngst follow - up of the sirtf square degree survey , lasting 1 month ( 330 fields @xmath16 @xmath100  s ) , would detect all these galaxies at high snr in addition to many objects with lower star formation rates .",
    "the detection of redshifted pah emission provides a unique signature of embedded star formation , and protects against confusion with galactic cirrus , that limits the usefulness of longer wavelength searches .",
    "the study of galaxy clustering is a classical test of theories of cosmic structure formation and a means of discriminating among cosmological world models . since an ifts acquires simultaneously both spatial and redshift information , it is the ideal instrument for the exploration of 3-dimensional clustering .",
    "the @xmath53 fov of our ifts is well - matched to the size of clusters of galaxies at @xmath101 .",
    "foreground contamination will be a serious obstacle to the identification of high-@xmath4 clusters , and obtaining spectra of very many ( faint ) galaxies is critical to establishing cluster membership and richness . without redshifts , clusters might easily go unnoticed .",
    "since an ifts obtains a spectrum for every pixel in the fpa , it is suited to the discovery and study of clusters .",
    "in particular , obtaining spectra of galaxies with complex morphologies ( where slit placement would be difficult or wasteful of light ) is straightforward with an ifts .",
    "examples include young galaxies that appear as a collection of small proto- globular cluster - sized clumps undergoing bursts of star formation ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) , or galaxies undergoing merging .",
    "ifts spectral scans with 1000 spectral channels are well - suited to probing the velocity dispersion of rich clusters ( @xmath102   km  s@xmath35 ) . in a @xmath26  s scan ,",
    "an ifts can obtain spectra throughout the 1 - 5 @xmath1 m region of objects at the 800 njy level ( snr=5 ) , i.e. , @xmath93 star - forming galaxies at @xmath103 or @xmath93 ellipticals , if they exist , at @xmath104 .",
    "emission line diagnostics such as [ oiii ] and h@xmath105 are well - suited to probing the cluster velocity field .",
    "in addition , absorption lines such as nai can be used to study the interstellar absorption of cluster galaxies ( cf .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "1996 )    since we will simultaneously obtain high snr rest - frame optical / uv morphology for these objects , it will be possible to study the virialization process and merging history of high-@xmath4 clusters . these results , while interesting in and of themselves , will also complement future x - ray studies of the cluster virialization process to be carried out with axaf .",
    "since a spectrum is obtained for every pixel , ifts studies of clusters will also detect and obtain spectra for gravitational lens arcs and images .",
    "while the morphology and surface brightness structure of lensed images can be used to reconstruct the cluster mass distribution , their spectra can be used to probe the properties of very distant galaxies at high snr ( e.g. , franx et al . 1997 ) .",
    "simultaneous broad wavelength studies of star forming regions enable the study of stars , brown dwarfs , and planets at short wavelengths ( @xmath106 m ) and their formation environments at longer wavelengths ( @xmath107 m ) .",
    "ngst can observe low - mass stars in star - forming regions out to several kpc , and will map out the detailed properties of protoplanetary disks as a function of age , stellar mass , and environment in many star - forming regions with a total sample of thousands of stars .",
    "the unique ability of an ifts to obtain colors and spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range for every object in the field makes it a powerful tool .",
    "colors , reddening , luminosity and spectral classification for every object will discriminate against cluster non - members , allow construction of hertzsprung - russell diagrams , and provide determination of cluster ages , age spreads , and measurement of the initial mass function .    the combination of the nir and mir channels of an ifts can be used to determine the frequencies and lifetimes of protoplanetary disks and to understand the evolution of their dust and gas . while nir excess emission traces hot dust near ( 0.1 au ) the star , the mir is critical for probing material at planet formation distances .",
    "spectra from 1 - 15  @xmath1 m at @xmath108 will provide detailed spectral energy distributions and yield radial disk structure , reveal gaps due to the presence of protoplanets , and determine dust composition from solid - state emission features . for stars",
    "in which active accretion has ceased , and in older clusters , an ifts will provide sensitive mir measurements of optically thin dust disks , the precursors of @xmath105 pic - like systems .",
    "spectroscopy of the mir rotational lines of h@xmath109 will be used to determine the relative gas and dust dispersal time - scales and place limits on the time for the formation of giant gas planets .",
    "star formation regions are ideal for the study of the sub - stellar mass function and isolated super - planets due to the high stellar density and the brightness of sub - stellar objects in their youth .",
    "an exciting prospect is the study of extra - solar giant planets ( egps ) that have been ejected from young planetary systems .",
    "the unexpected discovery that some jupiter - mass planets orbiting nearby stars have highly eccentric orbits ( marcy & butler 1996 ; cochran et al . 1997 ) suggests that ejection of planets by dynamical scattering is a common outcome of the planet formation process ( lin & ida 1997 ) .",
    "these planets can be distinguished from free - floating egps that formed in isolation ( via gravitational collapse ) by their high proper motions that will far exceed the velocity dispersions in young clusters .",
    "very young ( 1 myr ) clusters are optimum for searching for ejected egps since they would be luminous and not have traveled far from where they formed .",
    "in addition , the high stellar density ( @xmath110/fov ) provides a high probability of discovering ejected egps .",
    "planets formed at au distances will be ejected with velocities @xmath69 30 km s@xmath35 ; in orion this is a proper motion of 0.06 \" in 5 yr , easily measured during the ngst lifetime .",
    "the discovery of high proper - motion egps will provide an unique opportunity to study , via @xmath111 100 spectroscopy , the atmospheres of _ true jupiter analogs _",
    "( i.e. , planets with a formation history similar to that of our own solar system ) without the usual difficulties of studying orbiting planets in the glare of the central star .",
    "an ifts on ngst can be used to measure the mass function for sub - stellar objects from brown dwarfs to super - planet masses on account of its ability to obtain photometry and spectroscopy of distant ( @xmath1121 kpc ) , young open clusters .",
    "such clusters are well matched to the fov of our ifts , and @xmath113 spectroscopy will provide spectral classification via h@xmath109o and ch@xmath114 bands of several hundred very low - mass stars and sub - stellar objects per cluster . at an age of 10 myr ,",
    "an ifts can study free - floating super - planets of 5 @xmath115 at a distance of 1 kpc in @xmath26  s. comparison of the atmospheric compositions implied by the spectral properties of ejected egps and those formed in isolation may confirm their different formation histories .",
    "kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) hold great significance for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system , both as a source of short period comets and as primitive remnants of the planet - building phase of solar system history .",
    "one of the primary barriers to the detailed study of kbos is that ground - based surveys do not reach deep enough limiting magnitudes to accumulate significant samples of objects .",
    "in addition , the high proper motion of kbos ( 0.5 - 2.5\" / hour for objects at 40 au ) requires that accurate orbital parameters must first be derived for precise slit placement in spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "an ifts offers the sensitivity and multi - object capability that is perfectly suited to discovery and follow up spectroscopy of numerous , faint , high proper motion targets . in an ifts surveys of the ecliptic plane , kbos would be detected by their characteristic proper motion observed in a series of images taken at each successive opd .",
    "the corresponding interferograms for each detected object may be appropriately re - registered and stacked for fourier transform recovery of the spectrum for each source .",
    "the spectrum of kbos is a clue to their surface composition and collisional history .    assuming a typical @xmath116 color for kbos ( e.g. , tegler & romanishin 1997 ) and extrapolating the number counts at @xmath117 ( jewitt , luu , & chen 1996 ) to the njy level , an ifts scan of @xmath26  s over 5 spectral channels between 1 - 5 @xmath1 m is sufficient to detect about 40 kbos per @xmath53 fov at snr=10 .",
    "much higher spectral resolution scans are feasible for brighter objects . from these data",
    "we would be able to construct a detailed census of objects between the orbit of neptune and the oort cloud , and thereby provide a direct observation of the solar nebula and unique constraints on the dynamical history of the solar system .",
    "an ifts instrument can perform a wide variety of ngst science .",
    "the advantages of the ifts concept are :    1 .",
    "deep imaging acquired simultaneously with higher spectral resolution data over a broad wavelength range .",
    "2 .   `` hands - off '' , unbiased , multi - object , slitless spectroscopy ( ideal for moving objects ) .",
