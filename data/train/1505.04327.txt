    "spiral arms are one of the the most striking , beautiful and scientifically challenging structures of disc galaxies .",
    "they have fascinated and intrigued astronomers for centuries . as a rough initial approximation to treat this complex problem , the spiral arms had to be assumed as almost massless and/or with extremely modest pitch angles , in order to obtain a solution as a linear perturbation to the axisymmetric background potential .",
    "the proposed solution to the permanence of spiral arms in galaxies was based on the spiral density wave linear theory ( @xcite , inspired in the 60 s work of b. lindblad and p.o .",
    "lindblad ) .",
    "the analytical solution at first order of the theory , known as the tight - winding approximation ( twa ) , that represents a weak potential model , extremely idealized as a smooth , even negligible perturbation to the background potential , was modeled as a simplified cosine function to represent the spiral arms gravitational potential .",
    "probably followed by this initial attempt of solving the nature of spiral arms , a lot of work has tackled repeatedly the problem of modeling them , as a simplified periodic function that disregards the importance of their dynamical effects . however ,",
    "spiral arms have proven to be an influential feature on galactic modern models ( such as perlas and n - body models , based on three dimensional density structures ) , far beyond of a simple smooth perturbation .",
    "if we compare the spiral arms with the galactic bar , the latter has a mass between 10 and 20% of the disc mass @xcite , unlike the spiral arms that have a mass smaller in general than 5% of the disc mass @xcite .",
    "consequently , the largest influence on the disc of strongly barred galaxies is , of course , due to the central bar .",
    "therefore one would be tempted to oversimplify the scenario , by assuming that spiral arms are not influential at all on the dynamics of the disc . however , there are determinations that suggest that the majority of spiral galaxies , or at least those with clearly delineated spiral arms , are rather far from being linear @xcite .    based on all those rigorous studies ,",
    "spiral arms seem to merit an extra effort to model them beyond a simple perturbing term .",
    "this fact is even more significant in the case of the interstellar gas , which is considerably more sensitive to the details of the potential , and in general , responds strongly even if the mass of the spiral arms is only a small fraction of the axisymmetric background @xcite .    * for almost a century , formal studies of spiral arms have been carried on . yet , the spiral arms morphology , origin and nature are still poorly understood . with respect to their morphology",
    ", there is plentiful theoretical and observational literature on structures related to spiral arms , such as spurs , branches , feathers and beads , and their plausible explanations @xcite .",
    "regarding spurs and feathering , interesting scenarios to explain these features include plain hydrodynamic simulations , where the kelvin - helmholtz instability creates spurs produced by shocks with the spiral arms ( @xcite ; an extension to self - gravitating three dimensional models of this work is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "other scenarios include the use of global mhd simulations , adding gas self - gravity and magnetic fields that produce differential compression of gas flowing through the arms resulting in the formation of sheared structures in the interarm regions that resemble spurs and feathers @xcite , or through gravitational or magneto - jeans instabilities @xcite .",
    "*    on the other hand , features such as branches are significantly longer than spurs that emerge almost parallel to the main spiral arms but with different pitch angles ( usually smaller ) , and are generally associated with resonances .",
    "it is worth to note that , in the literature , the names spurs , feathers and branches are assigned to slightly different structures . in this work",
    "we will adopt the definition given by @xcite and @xcite , where the `` spurs '' and `` feathers '' are small structures that arise almost perpendicularly from the main spiral arm , and `` branches '' are narrow structures that arise almost parallel to the main spiral arm , with smaller pitch angles and extension longer than spurs ( examples of branches can be seen in galaxies like ngc 309 , ngc 1637 , ngc 2997 , ngc 6946 , among others ) .",
    "regarding such structures , theory and gas simulations have already shown a bifurcation of spiral arms produced by ultraharmonic resonances induced by the main spiral arm on the background gas flow @xcite . in this case , the bifurcation of the arms is expected due to the topology of the stable periodic orbits at the 4/1 resonance .",
    "other interpretations also include the possibility that branches are the response of the gas produced by strong shocks against the main massive spiral arms , i.e. the ones made mainly of older and smaller stars * @xcite . *",
    "specifically , regarding the milky way galaxy , its general structure has been extensively studied and the latest determinations seem to agree with two grand design symmetric spiral arms , seen on ir and optical , and some other weaker arms , detectable mainly in optical observations @xcite .",
    "the weaker arms ( * branches * ) have been explained through hydrodynamic simulations as the response to the two - armed stellar pattern .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite found that the gas response to a barred potential can produce a four - armed spiral structure .",
    "likewise , from hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations , the gas responds to an imposed two - armed spiral potential with four spiral arms @xcite . in this context , the gas component shocks at the position of the spiral arms , producing a density enhancement and star formation @xcite that , depending on the relative velocity between the gas and the spiral arm , dwell upstream or downstream or in the spiral arm .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that the nonlinear response of the gas to a stationary stellar spiral arm potential may produce two shocks , which then would be associated to a doubling of the spiral arm number as seen in the gas component .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that shocks in galaxies arise necessarily if the spiral arm strength exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "additionally , they found a range of values for the wave frequency that generates an ultraharmonic resonance which can provoke a secondary compression of the interstellar gas .",
    "this effect has been related to the origin of the carina arm in the milky way @xcite , for example . however , since branches have been traditionally explained as shocks induced by the spiral arms , it is important to mention other observational work that shows there is little difference ( or non at all ) in the star formation efficiency ( i.e. no shocks ) between the spiral arms regions and the rest of the disk @xcite .    finally , regarding their nature , a problem of great interest is whether spiral arms are a transient or a long - lived feature . on this matter ,",
    "recent numerical simulations show that spiral arms are transient and recurrent structures @xcite .",
    "however , in a study by @xcite on a sample of 27 galaxies , the authors concluded that the break found in the radial metallicity distribution near to corotation resonance ( cr ) , implies that the spiral structure is a rather long lived feature .",
    "other authors , employing different techniques , seem to find observational proofs of long - lasting spiral arms @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the gas response to a bisymmetric spiral arm potential . for this purpose we employed two different models , a cosine potential ( generally used in literature ) and the three - dimensional , density distribution based potential perlas , applied to the particular case of a milky way - like galaxy . with this study",
    "we find an alternative explanation to the formation of branches in disk galaxies , and their relation to transient or long - lived spiral arms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] , the galactic potential used to compute the stellar orbits and the mhd initial simulation set - up are described . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present first a comparison between the models of the spiral arms : perlas and the cosine potential ; second , we present the gas response to spiral arms perlas model changing the structural parameters such as the pitch angle and the mass of the spiral arms , and their connection with the presence of galactic branches as a signature of transient spiral arms . finally , we present a discussion and our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "motivated by the fact that the gas in galaxies is dynamically colder than the stellar disk , in addition to being collisional , we can expect it to be much more sensitive to details of the given potential than stars .",
    "therefore , any differences between the cosine and perlas potentials might be magnified in gas with respect to the stellar response . * and so , * for purposes of comparison",

    "in contrast , the perlas spiral arms model @xcite is a bisymmetric , three - dimensional , self - gravitating stationary model based on an adjustable mass distribution , rather than a local arm approximation , as the cosine potential .",
    "several studies have shown that there are differences in the stellar orbital dynamics when the spiral arms are modeled with the cosine potential or with the perlas model @xcite . furthermore , chaotic orbital studies have demonstrated that a more detailed spiral arm potential ( the perlas model ) induces an important fraction of chaos , enough to destroy the spiral structure @xcite , when all chaotic behavior was originally attributed to effects produced by the bar , such as overlapping of resonances @xcite .",

    "the spiral arms have a well defined mass , unlike the cosine potential , where the spiral arms are treated as a periodic function of the potential not straightforward translatable to mass .",

    "notice that in this last simulation , there is not much that can be said about the ( stellar or gaseous ) orbital support since periodic orbits tend to disappear due to the strong forcing of the imposed spiral arms , meaning that spiral arms would rather be transient by construction in this case and the mhd gaseous disk behavior is difficult to predict from periodic orbit computations .",
    "however , such as the stellar arms constructed in this case , the gaseous spiral would be transient in likely even shorter timescales than in the case where periodic orbits exist but settle down systematically in smaller pitch angles than the original imposed spiral arms in the region where periodic orbits do exist .",

    "we conclude that the spiral arm strength is not responsible for the four - arm gas response , but rather it is the product of the forcing generated by the whole density distribution better represented by the perlas model that , in turn , forces the periodic orbit response to shift its crowding regions inside the imposed locus of the massive spiral arms . *",
    "using the perlas model , we changed the structural parameters of the spiral arms according to the observational and theoretical uncertainties in the determination of the milky way s spiral arms in literature . within these values , for the general case , the stellar response density maxima systematically forms spiral arms with a smaller pitch angle than the imposed spiral , meaning that the spiral arms might be a transient feature in the milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "the presence of a second pair of lighter spiral arms ( `` branches '' ) , with smaller pitch angles induced by the first more massive stellar spiral arms , might be evidence of the lack of support to the stronger arms on a galactic disk , and therefore evidence of the transient nature of spiral arms in a given galaxy . applying this scenario to the milky way ,",
    "for the stronger spiral arm values reported in literature ( i.e. pitch angles larger than @xmath72 , and masses larger than @xmath73 of the disk ) , the spiral arms in the milky way would be of transient nature . *",
    "although in this work we applied the models to milky way - like galactic discs , it is worth noticing that the results are general .",
    "this means that the presence of branches with smaller pitch angles than the main arms might be the `` smoking gun '' that proves transiency of spiral arms in any given galaxy .",
