    "in two seminal works in the early 1980 s , sachs  @xcite and conway and gordon  @xcite showed that @xmath1 , the complete graph on six vertices , is _ intrinsically linked _ , i.e. , every embedding of it in @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) contains two disjoint cycles that form a nontrivial link . in @xcite ,",
    "conway and gordon also showed that @xmath4 is _ intrinsically knotted _",
    ", i.e. , every embedding of it in @xmath2 contains a nontrivial knot .",
    "since then , these results have been extended to other graphs , to more `` complex '' types of linking and knotting , and to _ linear embeddings _ ( or _ straight - edge embeddings _ ) , i.e. , embeddings of graphs in @xmath2 in which every edge of the graph is a straight line segment .",
    "for example , negami  @xcite showed that given any knot or link , for all sufficiently large @xmath5 , every linear embedding of @xmath6 contains that knot or link .",
    "miyauchi  @xcite extended this result to complete bipartite graphs . and ramirez alfonsin  @xcite showed that every linear embedding of @xmath4 contains a trefoil .",
    "going back to `` not - necessarily - linear embeddings , '' a graph is called _ intrinsically @xmath5-linked _ ( i@xmath5l , for short ) if every embedding of it in @xmath2 contains a _ non - split _ @xmath5-component link ,",
    "i.e. , for every embedded @xmath7-sphere @xmath8 disjoint from the link , all @xmath5 components of the link are contained in the same component of @xmath9 .",
    "the smallest complete graph that could possibly be i3l is @xmath0 , since @xmath10 does nt have enough vertices to contain a @xmath11-link ( each of the three components requires at least 3 vertices ) . in @xcite ,",
    "flapan , naimi , and pommersheim showed that @xmath0 is not i3l , but @xmath12 is ; they illustrated an embedding of @xmath0 that contains no non - split @xmath11-link .",
    "this embedding , however , was not a linear embedding .",
    "so it is natural to ask whether there also exists a linear embedding of @xmath0 that contains no non - split @xmath11-link . in this paper",
    "we show that there is no such embedding .",
    "[ maintheorem ] every linear embedding of @xmath0 in @xmath13 contains a non - split link with three components .",
    "it is not difficult to show that every finite graph has only finitely many linear embeddings up to isotopy .",
    "so , in theory , one could check every linear embedding of @xmath0 to see whether or not there is one with no non - split @xmath11-links . finding all linear embeddings of @xmath0 up to isotopy , however , is a different story .",
    "we were inspired by the paper of ramirez alfonsin  @xcite to use oriented matroid theory to approach this problem . to every linear embedding of a graph one",
    "can in a natural way associate an oriented matroid .",
    "the oriented matroid determines up to `` linear embedding isotopy '' the embedding of the graph , in particular , it determines which pairs of disjoint cycles in the embedded graph are linked .",
    "linear embeddings of @xmath0 , in particular , give non - degenerate uniform oriented matroids of rank 4 on 9 elements . and",
    "the set of all such oriented matroids has already been found by the use of computers @xcite .",
    "this provided us with a great tool for working on the @xmath0 problem .",
    "it turns out that there are over two billion such oriented matroids .",
    "we wrote a mathematica computer program , which we ran in parallel on 31 computers for 36 hours on average , to go through these oriented matroids .",
    "the program , with full documentation , is available for download at @xcite .",
    "we thank lew ludwig for suggesting this problem to us ; lukas finschi for his help on retrieving the oriented matroid database and for maintaing an awesome website on oriented matroids ; and sonoko moriyama for sharing with us the oriented matroid database we needed .",
    "we are also grateful to the faculty of the mathematics department at occidental college for offering to run our program on their computers .",
    "before giving a precise and detailed account of how oriented matroids are associated with linear embeddings of graphs , we first give an informal explanation for the case of @xmath0 .",
    "every linear embedding of a graph in @xmath2 is determined solely by where its vertices are embedded . in a linearly embedded _",
    "complete _ graph , no four vertices are coplanar , since otherwise at least two edges would intersect each other in their interiors .",
    "suppose we are given a linear embedding @xmath14 of @xmath0 .",
    "we label the vertices @xmath15 .",
    "given any four vertices @xmath16 with @xmath17 , we can form three vectors , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . since the four points @xmath16 are not coplanar , @xmath20 is a basis for @xmath2 and the determinant of the matrix @xmath21 $ ] is nonzero .",
    "we assign a @xmath22 or @xmath23 sign to @xmath24 according to whether @xmath25 is positive or negative .",
    "doing this for every set of four vertices of @xmath14 amounts to associating an oriented matroid to @xmath14 : a uniform oriented matroid of rank @xmath26 on @xmath5 elements is an assignment of a @xmath22 or @xmath23 sign to every @xmath26-subset of the @xmath5 elements ( called bases ) , subject to certain conditions ( called `` chirotope conditions '' ) .",
    "it turns out that this set of @xmath22 and @xmath23 signs captures enough information for determining which pairs of triangles in @xmath14 are linked . for three non - collinear points",
    ", we will refer to both the union of the three edges they determine and to their convex hull as a triangle .",
    "a different but equivalent way to assign an oriented matroid to the embedding @xmath14 is via circuits instead of bases . for each 5-subset of the 9 vertices of @xmath14 ,",
    "either one of the vertices will be inside the tetrahedron determined by the remaining four vertices , or two of the vertices will determine an edge that `` pierces '' the triangle determined by the remaining three vertices , as in figure  [ circuits ] .",
    "accordingly , each 5-subset of the 9 vertices is given a 4 - 1 or a 3 - 2 partition .",
    "this assignment of a 4 - 1 or a 3 - 2 partition to every 5-subset is sufficient for describing an oriented matroid of rank 4 on 9 elements : a uniform oriented matroid of rank @xmath26 on @xmath5 elements can be defined by assigning a partition to each of the @xmath27-subsets ( called circuits ) of its elements , subject to certain conditions ( called `` circuit axioms '' ) .",
    "there is a procedure for obtaining the signs of the bases from the partitioned circuits , and vice versa .",
    "knowing exactly which edges pierce which triangles is sufficient for determining whether any two disjoint triangles are linked or not .",
    "thus , knowing the circuit partitions of the oriented matroid associated to @xmath14 is all we need to determine the links in it . with this informal description of oriented matroids and their connection",
    "to linear embeddings and linking , we now move on to a more formal and detailed presentation .",
