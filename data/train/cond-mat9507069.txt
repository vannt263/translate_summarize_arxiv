    "<S> we observe a dramatic reduction in the degree of spin - polarization of a two - dimensional electron gas in a magnetic field when the fermi energy moves off the mid - point of the spin - gap of the lowest landau level , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid decay of spin alignment to an unpolarized state occurs over small changes to both higher and lower magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of electron spin polarization as a function of @xmath1 is measured through the magneto - absorption spectra which distinguish the occupancy of the two electron spin states . </S>",
    "<S> the data provide experimental evidence for the presence of skyrmion excitations where exchange energy dominates zeeman energy in the integer quantum hall regime at @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 73.40.hm , 78.66.-w , 73.20.mf , 71.70.gm , 73.20.dx    psfig    the exchange energy dominates the basic physics in gaas two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) when the fermi energy is located between spin - split landau levels at odd - integral filling factors @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the small @xmath2-factor in gaas makes the zeeman energy much less than the coulomb energy which is responsible for the exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the small @xmath2 results in a spin degree of freedom , even at high magnetic fields , leading to spin - unpolarized ground - states and to novel excited - states at fractional filling factors.@xcite recent theoretical work has pointed out that the response of a 2des with a small @xmath2-factor in the spin - polarized state ( @xmath0 ) to a change of one quanta of magnetic flux is not a single - particle spin - flip excitation , but rather a macroscopic spin object called a skyrmion or charged spin - texture excitation ( cste ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidence of these excitations have been recently observed in nmr and in tilted - field transport measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they consist of a radial spin density distribution that is reversed at the center but gradually heals to the spin background over a distance of many magnetic lengths . </S>",
    "<S> since each particle sits in a nearly aligned spin neighborhood , the exchange contribution is significantly smaller for the cste than for a single flipped spin . </S>",
    "<S> the physical size of the cste is governed by the relative strength of the zeeman and coulomb energies , parameterized by @xmath3 , @xcite where @xmath4 is the magnetic length and @xmath5 the dielectric constant . in the limit of vanishing @xmath2-factor </S>",
    "<S> , the radius extends to nearly the edge of the sample , while for @xmath6 the size shrinks to zero , eliminating the distinction between single - particle and skyrmion excitations . in gaas samples with 2des densities of @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> cste s are then expected to be the lowest energy excitations with the change in total spin per flux - quanta significantly greater than one , destroying the spin - polarization of the electron system for small excursions from @xmath0 .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present experimental observation of skyrmions through the rapid loss of spin - polarization about @xmath0 measured with polarized absorption spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show quenching of absorption to the lower energy , spin - up electron band directly correlated to an increase in the higher energy , spin - down absorption at @xmath0 ( see figure  [ sky - fig1 ] ) . as we will show , this indicates the spin - up state fills with electrons while the spin - down state empties , providing a large spin polarization @xmath9 ( see inset ) which exhibits a pronounced , symmetric decay when @xmath1 deviates from @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this new technique provides a measurement of the absolute electron spin and has identified saturation in the spin polarization not previously resolved .    </S>",
    "<S> the samples were two single - side n - modulation doped algaas - gaas @xmath11 single quantum wells ( sqw ) . </S>",
    "<S> sample a had mobility @xmath12 and 2des carrier concentration of @xmath13 , and sample b had @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in transport these wafers exhibited strong fractional hall minima at @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the sqws were chosen to minimize inhomogeneous broadening , and for absorption measurements were mounted strain - free and thinned to @xmath18@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> incident power of @xmath19mw/@xmath20 yielded typical signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath21 with line widths of @xmath22 to @xmath23 mev ( fwhm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption coefficients @xmath24 , were calculated neglecting reflection which has been measured in similar samples to contribute only a small variation ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the raw transmission spectra @xmath26 were then normalized to obtain the magneto - absorption coefficient @xmath27 , where @xmath28 quantum well width .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we concentrate only on the lowest landau level in the regime from @xmath29 about the spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> representative spectra taken in lcp and rcp polarizations are displayed in the lower left and right of figure  [ sky - fig1 ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as described below , the final electron spin state for the lowest energy lcp ( rcp ) absorption is the lower ( higher ) energy spin - up ( spin - down ) state . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - band optical absorption is proportional to the available density of states in these final electron spin levels . </S>",
    "<S> the total spin - polarization is then given by the difference between the number of spin - up and spin - down states under the constraint that the sum yields the particle number . </S>",
    "<S> with this technique we are able to determine within @xmath30 accuracy the total spin . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to figure  [ sky - fig1 ] shows the spin - polarization @xmath9 , as a function of filling factor determined in this way for the data presented .    we should mention that a wealth of data on a seemingly similar effect , the quenching of the photoluminescence from the lowest energy transition accompanied by an increase in the emission from the higher energy transition , has been observed by one of the authors and others@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the total integrated emission was relatively constant , yielding an explanation based on a decrease in the re - combination rate in the lowest energy state due to localization . in the absence of significant non - radiative channels , </S>",
    "<S> the minority photo - excited hole must eventually emit a photon on re - combination , and hence the emission from the two electron levels must be correlated </S>",
    "<S> . however , not only is absorption largely unaffected by localization , but also the photons absorbed which cause transitions into the lower and higher energy spin states are completely uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the conclusion that the correlation observed in the absorption data is due to the changes in the occupancy and thus the total spin of the electron system .    to determine the occupancy of the electron spin states and hence the spin - polarization , we have first calculated the inter - band transitions and optical matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> sub - band energies and wave - functions for electrons and holes were determined self - consistently within the local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the hole landau levels were then calculated employing the luttinger hamiltonian@xcite to take into account the valence band mixing.@xcite figure  [ sky - fig2 ] compares the calculated and measured peak energy positions versus magnetic field about @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the insets display measured and calculated spectra , and the lower right schematic identifies the relevant transitions : the lowest energy transition in rcp is from a pure heavy - hole state with @xmath31 to the upper electron spin state @xmath32 which we label @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy state in lcp is from a mixed heavy - hole state with dominant character in the @xmath34 components to the lower energy spin state @xmath35 , labeled @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath35 part of the hole envelope function for @xmath36 is associated with a higher oscillator index and can not cause an optical transition to the lowest electron landau level.@xcite this is corroborated both by the absence of absorption peaks at the same energy in the different polarizations , and the narrowness ( less than the bare zeeman energy ) of the @xmath36 transition at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> these observations confirm the validity of the matrix element calculations in the axial approximation .    we proceed to determine the spin level occupancy from the raw data as follows : the spin - polarization per particle is given by @xmath37    where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is the landau level degeneracy @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the available density of states in the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) spin up ( down ) band of the lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated absorption peaks are linearly related to the number of available final states @xmath41 of the transition as @xmath44    where @xmath45 , the oscillator strengths @xmath46 are taken to be constant over the narrow absorption peaks , and @xmath47 label the initial and final states respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the constant of proportionality @xmath48 may be found using the sum - rule @xmath49    which conserves particle number @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath51    and the available densities of states are obtained from (  [ eq - na ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated scaling factor @xmath52 changes by less than @xmath53 over the range of @xmath54 , while typical @xmath55 s change by nearly an order of magnitude , demonstrating that the raw data come very close to obeying the sum - rule over this field range and indicating that few higher - order processes are affecting the absorption .    </S>",
    "<S> several additional self - consistency checks exist for this treatment , providing confidence in our hole level and matrix elements calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath9 from the @xmath33 and @xmath36 transitions , and the one from the @xmath56 and @xmath36 transitions are nearly identical in the range where the transitions have good signal to noise ( see inset to fig . 1 . ) . since the @xmath57 and the @xmath58 independently monitor the occupancy of the upper electron spin state , the similarity of the spin - polarizations calculated means that the matrix elements are internally consistent with our simple sum - rule and that the data truly reflect a change in occupancy of the electron spin states . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the matrix elements themselves are varying relatively slowly over the filling factor range of interest @xmath54 , typically less than @xmath59 , and hence can not simply account for the structure observed . </S>",
    "<S> nor are they particularly sensitive to the carrier density or the precise value of the zero - field splitting ; these parameters have been varied with no significant change in the final spin polarization @xmath9 .    in figure  [ sky - fig3 ] spin polarization versus filling factor </S>",
    "<S> is plotted for samples a and b and compared with both a single particle and a skyrmion based model . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle model is based on exchange enhanced @xmath2-factor that modulates the overlap of the two electron spin levels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the self - consistent solution of @xmath60    where @xmath61    @xmath62 is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath63 is the field dependent level width . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange coefficient @xmath64 in (  [ eq-1p ] ) , was chosen to satisfy @xmath65 at @xmath0 , as determined from activated transport measurements in @xcite , leaving @xmath66 the only adjustable parameter . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the single particle model does not capture the behavior of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization quickly saturates to unity for @xmath67 and goes as @xmath68 for @xmath69 , in contrast to the measured polarization which decays symmetrically about @xmath0 at a much more rapid rate .    </S>",
    "<S> the changes in polarization do adhere however , to a treatment which includes skyrmion excitations ( see solid line fit figure  [ sky - fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the model proposed by barret _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite the one - particle available densities of states are scaled by a parameter @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) that gives the number of spin flips per unpaired flux quanta @xmath72 , above ( below ) @xmath0 . in this model the spin polarization is    @xmath73    particle - hole symmetry requires that the size of the skyrmion be the same as the anti - skyrmion , @xmath74 , giving a rapid quasi - symmetric loss in polarization about @xmath0 for @xmath75 . when @xmath76 the single particle model is recovered ( modulo overlap effects ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fit for sample b in figure  [ sky - fig3 ] gives a skyrmion size of of @xmath77 which is near the theoretically predicted value for a 2des in gaas of @xmath78 @xcite . for sample </S>",
    "<S> a the skyrmion size is somewhat smaller , only @xmath79 flipped particles per flux quanta .    </S>",
    "<S> a feature of our technique is that it allows a quantitative determination of the total spin . </S>",
    "<S> the data display a marked saturation in the peak spin polarization at @xmath0 for decreasing temperature ( see figures  [ sky - fig3 ] and  [ sky - fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation could be due to the finite level width with the result of non - vanishing overlap of the spin - states at @xmath0 , consistent with our measured line - widths .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated a novel method of extracting spin polarization from interband absorption spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent checks of the subband and matrix element calculations as well as an adherence of the raw data to a simple sum rule provide confidence in our technique . </S>",
    "<S> the measured size of the charged spin - texture excitations is consistent with a spin of @xmath80 flips per unpaired flux quanta .    </S>",
