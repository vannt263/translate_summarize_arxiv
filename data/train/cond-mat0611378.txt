    "the electronic transport through carbon nanotubes ( cnt s ) has received much attention in the last decade due to the peculiar features of the band structure of these quasi - one dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "depending of their diameter and chirality cnt s can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behavior and therefore be promising candidates for new carbon nanotube - based electronic devices .",
    "some of them have already been realized , such as field effect transistors@xcite , field emission displays@xcite and nanosensors@xcite .",
    "the quantum - mechanic behavior of the electronic transport in cnt s has been experimentally confirmed by tans et .",
    "@xcite whom showed that individual single - walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) between two contacts behaves as coherent quantum wires , and by frank et .",
    "@xcite , they have proved the quantization of the conductance of multiwalled carbon nanotubes . on the other hand , effects of time - dependent potentials on transport properties of cnt s has been studied previously for various authors @xcite .",
    "recently , kim et .",
    "al.@xcite studied experimentally the microwave response of individual multiwall cnt finding an enhancement of the linear conductance under the microwave radiation .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the quantum transport through swcnt connected to leads in the presence of an external radiation field .",
    "specifically , we consider a time - dependent spatially uniform potential applied normal to the tube for modeling the effect of the radiation field .",
    "this problem is closely related to photon - assisted tunneling in nanostructures@xcite .",
    "basically , the external field induces the apparition of side - bands in the spectrum and therefore the tunneling current is drastically modified@xcite .",
    "we solve the problem using standard nonequilibrium green s function ( ngf ) techniques .",
    "the conductance is calculated by the landauer formula in terms of the transmission function which is obtained from the retarded and advanced green s function of the swcnt in the presence of the field , and the coupling of the nanotube to the leads@xcite .",
    "we analyze the conductance spectra as a function of the frequency and amplitude of the external time - varying potential .",
    "we found that above a critical value of the radiation field intensity , an enhancement of the conductance as a function of the field strength occurs .",
    "the conductance increases displaying oscillations with amplitudes strongly dependent on the field frequency . for low photon energies in comparison to the lead - cnt coupling energies ,",
    "the oscillations evolve to a structure of well defined steps .",
    "this effect can be explained as due to the electric - field induced side - band resonances that increase the ldos at the fermi energy opening new channels for electronic transmission .",
    "the system under consideration is formed by a swcnt embedded between two leads .",
    "the full system is modeled by the following hamiltonian within a noninteracting picture , that can be written as @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the creation operator of an electron at the state @xmath3 of the carbon nanotube , and @xmath4 is the corresponding operator of an electron in the state @xmath5 of the right ( @xmath6 ) or left ( @xmath7 ) lead . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the energy spectrum of a metallic carbon nanotube@xcite .",
    "we will solve the problem using standard non - equilibrium green s function techniques . in this formalism",
    "the retarded and correlated green s function can be expressed by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . where the green s functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are obtained from the dyson equation @xmath13 $ ] , and the keldysh equation @xmath14 . where @xmath15 is the unperturbed green s function of the nanotube .",
    "the self energies are given by,@xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the fermi distribution .",
    "the line - width functions @xmath19 , in the wide bandwidth approximation , are taken to be independent of the energy and energy levels .",
    "once the green s function @xmath11 and @xmath12 are known , an expression for the current can be derived@xcite :    @xmath20 \\right\\ } \\right ) , \\ ] ]    if the cnt is perturbed by a time - dependent , spatially uniform , potential given by : @xmath21,@xcite the zero - voltage limit linear conductance will be given by@xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the time - averaged current .",
    "for this simple model an effective density of states can be derived ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the bare density of states corresponding to the cnt in the absence of the perturbing potential . in the case of a @xmath26 cnt in the tight - binding approximation this density of states",
    "can be expressed in analytic form as@xcite :    @xmath27 ^ 2}}\\right ) \\ ] ]    the above equation can be physically interpreted as follow : photon absorption ( @xmath28 ) and emission ( @xmath29 ) can be viewed as creating an effective electron density of states at energies @xmath30 with a probability given by @xmath31 .",
    "in what follow we will adopt the parameters : @xmath32 , which is the cnt hoping integral , and @xmath33 , the leads - cnt coupling parameters . figure 2",
    "shows the dos of a zigzag cnt ( 12,0 ) as a function of the energy in units of @xmath34 , for different values of the radiation field strength @xmath35 and for a particular photon energy @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the cnt pseudo - gap is strongly modified by the presence of the sideband resonances appearing due to the presence of the radiation field .",
    "these resonances are more dense near the fermi energy for increasing values of the field strength .",
    "this effect has strong influence on the system conductance due to the opening of new channels for electronic transmission , as we will see below .     and",
    "different values of the field strength.,width=264 ]    , for @xmath38 ( solid blue line ) , @xmath39 ( solid magenta line ) and @xmath40 ( dotted line).,width=264 ]    in figure 3 we have displayed the linear normalized conductance @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the conductance for zero field , for the cnt ( 12,0 ) as a function of the intensity of the radiation field .",
    "we have plotted the corresponding conductance for different photon energies @xmath36 ( blue online ) , @xmath43 ( magenta online)and @xmath44 ( dotted line ) .",
    "it can be observed that in all cases the conductance increases as a function of the radiation field strength . for low frequencies ,",
    "@xmath45 the conductance presents a very well defined structure of steps . for increasing frequencies",
    "some oscillations appears by inducing a complete suppression of the step features for higher frequencies .",
    "the steps structure in the conductance for low frequencies @xmath45 , can be understood because of in that range of frequencies the system is found in a quasi - static regime , and the spectrum as a function of the strength of the radiation field @xmath35 , is just linearly shifted . as the field intensity increases the van hove singularities cross the fermi energy leading to an abrupt increase in the conductance .",
    "in fact , each step in the conductance reflects the energy position of the corresponding van hove singularity of the nanotube dos .",
    "figure 4 shows the normalized conductance versus the strength of the radiation field for a ( 15,0 ) cnt .",
    "there we have included the corresponding dos in the same energy range .    , for @xmath38 .",
    "it is also plotted the corresponding dos of the cnt in the same energy range .",
    ", width=302 ]    .,width=302 ]    in figure 5 we show the behavior of the normalized resistance versus radiation - field strength with the nanotube radius .",
    "the figure displays plots for ( a ) ( 9,0 ) and ( b ) ( 18,0 ) metallic nanotubes . in both cases",
    "the step structure is clearly manifested with increasing number of steps for larger radii .",
    "this steps structure is a reflex of the cuasi - one dimensional density of states of the cnt .",
    "the above results can be compared with the experimental results of kim at al.@xcite whom studied the microwave response of an individual cnt .",
    "they effectively found that the resistance decreases as a function of the radiation field power regardless of the frequency . in their experiment the step structure is not observed because they studied a multiwall nanotube of about 25 nm wide . in this case",
    "the cuasi - one dimensional character of the cnt dos is completely suppressed .",
    "we have investigated quantum transport through swcnt connected to leads in the presence of an external radiation field .",
    "we studied the conductance spectra as a function of the frequency and of the field strength .",
    "we found that above a critical value of the field strength an enhancement of the conductance , or suppressed resistance , as a function of the field intensity occurs .",
    "the conductance increases displaying oscillations which amplitude shows a strong dependence on the frequency of the oscillating field . for low radiation energies in comparison to the lead - cnt coupling energies , the oscillations evolve toward a structure of well defined steps in the conductance .",
    "we have shown that in this range of frequencies the field intensity dependence of the conductance can give direct information of swcnt energy spectra .",
