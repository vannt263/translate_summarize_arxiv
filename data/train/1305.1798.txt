    "if the centre of @xmath119 is both a white vertex ( of one larger octagon in @xmath117 ) and at the same a red vertex ( of another larger octagon in @xmath117 ) , we cut @xmath119 into eight pieces @xmath120 precisely as above .",

    "the latter is equivalent to saying that @xmath132 is a tiling of @xmath3 .",

    "moreover , in each step , @xmath130 and @xmath136 are non - overlapping ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this can be seen as follows : by construction , the red parts and the white parts are distinct , thus their closures are non - overlapping .",
    "we can repeat the construction with any other octagon coloured red , instead of the octagon at 0 .",
    "again , this new fundamental cell ( @xmath138 , say ) does not overlap with any white parts .",

    "then one places smaller dodecagons on the vertices of the larger ones , either white , red or mixed , compare figure [ fig : fd12 ] .",

    "* case 3 : * rhombohedral ( 7 ) .",
    "this lattice consists of equidistant layers of the hexagonal lattice @xmath145 .",
    "so we can either use a thickened fundamental cell of @xmath145 with @xmath77-symmetry , yielding a three - dimensional fundamental cell @xmath5 with @xmath225 , @xmath226 and index @xmath19=2 $ ] .",
    "or we can use a thickened version of @xmath146 as in case 1 , yielding a fundamental cell with @xmath227 , @xmath228 and index @xmath19=4 $ ] .",
    "* case 4 : * orthorhombic ( 8 - 11 ) .",
    "these lattices consist of equidistant layers of rectangular lattices .",
    "thus we can use the thickened version of the fundamental cell of the rectangular lattice , its symmetry group being @xmath229 of order 16 .",
    "the rectangular lattices are indicated in figure [ fig:3d ] by shaded points . in number 11",
    "the rectangular lattice is rather hard to spot .",
    "one may ask whether lattice number 11 does indeed consist of _ equidistant _ layers of rectangular lattices , but this is clear from the lattice property .    * case 5 : * monoclinic ( 12 - 13 ) .",
    "these two lattices also consist of equidistant layers of rectangular lattices .",
    "thus we can reason as in the preceding case .",
    "alternatively , we can use rectangular cuboids as fundamental cells , having symmetry group @xmath230 of order 8 .",
    "* case 6 : * triclinic ( 14 ) .",
    "this lattice  or rather : these lattices  consist of layers of oblique lattices .",
    "we may use a right prism over a parallelogram as a fundamental cell , or a skew prism over a rectangle , or even a cuboid ( erected on the rectangles of figure [ generic ] ) . this yields symmetry groups @xmath231 of the fundamental cell of order 4 , or @xmath232 of order 8 , or @xmath233 of order 16 , respectively .",
    "the above results can imply several further questions . here",
    "we mention a few we assume to be of possible interest .",
    "the reason that we excluded cubic lattices in theorem [ thm : satz2 ] is that there exist no fundamental cells @xmath5 for the cubic lattices @xmath219 , bcc or fcc such that @xmath8 contains @xmath6 ( @xmath234 ) as a proper subgroup of finite index .",
    "this is just because there are no such groups @xmath235 .",
    "there still may be fundamental cells which have more symmetries in the sense that @xmath236 ( but the author doubts it ) .",
    "the reason that we excluded rhombic lattices in theorem [ thm : satz1 ] is that we were not able to find a general construction for fundamental cells @xmath5 for any rhombic lattice @xmath0 such that @xmath8 is larger than @xmath6 .",
    "one can construct such fundamental cells for several particular cases , but a general construction seems hard to obtain . if one tries to use the same idea as in the other non - obtuse cases  start with a packing of polygons of higher symmetry ( octagon , dodecagon , square ) and refine ",
    "one runs into problems because the packings are in general not vertex - to - vertex from some point on .",
    "are there fundamental cells @xmath5 with @xmath237 > 2 $ ] ?",
    "we have found a few ones : in the case of oblique plane lattices there is a rectangular fundamental cell with @xmath237 = 4 $ ] . in the case of the triclinic primitive lattice",
    "there is a cuboidal fundamental cell with @xmath237 = 8 $ ] .",
    "what is the maximal value of the index @xmath237 $ ] in @xmath1 ( @xmath238 ) ?      the results in the present paper has been obtained by considering all different classes of lattices with respect to their symmetry group .",
    "there are 5 such classes in @xmath3 , 14 such classes in @xmath4 , 64 such classes in @xmath239 , 189 such classes in @xmath240 and 826 such classes in @xmath241 @xcite . at some point it seems desirable to find more general arguments than case - by - case considerations .",
    "however , it is very likely that in higher dimensions there are several lattices @xmath0 with fundamental cells @xmath5 such that @xmath6 is a proper subgroup of @xmath8 .",
    "the constructions used in this paper work also in spherical or hyperbolic spaces , using spherical or hyperbolic regular @xmath22-gons .",
    "the fact that these @xmath22-gons are not similar to each other on different length scales does not matter .",
    "all we need is that there are edge - to - edge packings by regular @xmath22-gons on different length scales .",
    "the fundamental cells @xmath85 of the square lattice , @xmath146 of the hexagonal lattice and those of the rectangular lattices with incommensurate basis lengths are of fractal appearance . it might be possible to compute the hausdorff dimensions of the boundaries of these cells , as well as other fractal dimensions , like the box - counting dimension or the affinity dimension @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "the two latter dimensions are particularly easy to compute if one finds an iterated function system ( ifs ) generating the fractal under consideration , see @xcite . up to the knowledge of the author , no ifs for @xmath85 or @xmath146 or",
    "the fundamental cells of rectangular lattices are known yet .",
    "the constructions used in this paper can be altered in many ways .",
    "for instance , there are other ways to partition the octagons , dodecagons and squares into two regions of different colours than the one used in the proof of theorem [ thm : satz1 ] .",
    "all that is required is to keep the mirror symmetry of the partition , and take care that no overlaps occur .",
    "one possibility is just to interchange the colours .",
