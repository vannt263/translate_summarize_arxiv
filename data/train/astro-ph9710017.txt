    "until recently , the view that age is the second parameter of horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphology has been widely accepted .",
    "recent developments suggest , however , a much more complicated scheme where several parameters may be playing important rles ( stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 ; ferraro et al . 1997 ; etc . ) .",
    "second - parameter candidates can be divided into two categories : those which do _ not _ affect the hb luminosity ( age , mass loss on the red giant branch ) , and those which _ do _ ( envelope helium abundance @xmath0 , core mass at helium - flash ) .",
    "_ we thus propose to use rr lyrae variables , whose properties are strongly sensitive to the hb luminosity ( e.g. , van albada & baker 1971 ) , as a vertical diagnostic of the hb morphology_.      the limited number of variability studies for the outer - halo globular cluster pal  3 ( burbidge & sandage 1958 , bs58 ; gratton & ortolani 1984 , go84 ) has prompted us to undertake a new survey for short - period variables .",

    "ii cepheids are usually found in clusters with blue - hb tails only ( e.g. , smith & wehlau 1985 ) .",
    "the determination of rr lyrae  equilibrium temperatures \" ( @xmath1 ) relies on the transformation of mean colors into temperatures ( e.g. , sandage 1990 ; carney , storm , & jones 1992 , csj92 ) .",
    "csj92 demonstrated the existence of a tight relationship involving @xmath1 , periods , blue amplitudes ( @xmath2 ) , and metallicity [ fe / h ] for field rr lyraes .",
    "we have rederived the csj92 relationship from data in their table 4 , but using the latest [ fe / h ] values from layden ( 1994 ) .",
    "stars ss leo and tt lyn were excluded from the fit , due to their poorly determined parameters .    to our surprise , we discovered that the period term in the @xmath1period@xmath2[fe / h ] relationship does _ not _ lead to a significant reduction in the residuals to justify its inclusion .",
    "in fact , _ determining temperatures from the periods may easily mask the effects of luminosity variations upon cluster - to - cluster period shifts , and should thus be avoided whenever possible_. our new relationship reads :    @xmath3}.\\ ] ]    this relationship provides an excellent match to the csj92 temperatures .",
    "the rms deviation is only 56.9 k , compared with 54 k from eq .",
    "( 16 ) in csj92 ( which does include a period term ) .",
    "assuming eq .  ( 1 ) to be also valid for gc rr lyraes , we have computed temperatures and measured the  period shifts \" @xmath4 at fixed @xmath1 with respect to the  reference \" cluster m3 , for ab - type rr lyraes in a set of 34 gc s .",
    "blazhko variables were avoided .",
    "our main findings may be summarized as follows : a ) clusters with similar metallicity may present significantly different @xmath4 values ( e.g. , ngc  6171 vs. ngc  6712 ) ; b ) the bimodal - hb gc ngc  1851 shows very large @xmath4 s ( and also _ very _ high @xmath2 s ) , the opposite occuring in ngc  6229 ( which also has a bimodal hb ) ; c ) among the oosterhoff type ii ( ooii ) gc s , we find a range in @xmath4 s , with a mild correlation with hb type ( which however can be almost entirely ascribed to ngc  5986 ) ; d ) in the mean , ooii gc s do not show very large @xmath4 s ; e ) the rr lyrae variables in the metal - rich clusters 47  tuc and ngc  6388 have very large @xmath4 s ; f ) @xmath5  cen variables have large @xmath4 s , but a detailed analysis of the correlation between @xmath4 and [ fe / h ] in this cluster must await the resolution of the discrepant [ fe / h ] distributions found for its giants and rr lyraes ( suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) .",
    "possible helium abundance differences between field and gc rr lyraes ( sweigart 1997 ) may have to be further investigated , as far as the period - shift effect is concerned .",
    "in particular , from marconi s ( 1997 ) models , we find that _ m15 variables lie in the region of the @xmath6 plane most affected by @xmath0 , whereas the m3 ones fall mostly in the region not sensitive to @xmath0_.    carney , b. w. , storm , j. , & jones , r. v. 1992 , , 386 , 663 ( csj92 ) ferraro , f. r. , paltrinieri , b. , fusi pecci , f. , cacciari , c. , dorman , b. , & rood , r. t. 1997 , , 484 , l175 layden , a. c. 1994 , , 108 , 1016 marconi , m. 1997 , private communication sandage , a. 1990 , , 350 , 631 stetson , p. b. , vandenberg , d. a. , & bolte , m. 1996 , , 108 , 560 suntzeff , n. b. , & kraft , r. p. 1996",

    "recent hst observations have revealed that the metal - rich globular clusters ( gc s ) ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 contain an unexpected population of hot horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars and therefore exhibit the well - known second parameter effect ( rich et al .",
    "most surprisingly , the hb s of these clusters have a pronounced upward slope with decreasing @xmath30 , with the mean hb luminosity at the top of the blue tail being roughly 0.5  mag brighter in @xmath7 than the well - populated red clump , which itself also slopes upward .",
    "differential reddening is not the cause of these sloped hb s",
    "( piotto et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the second parameter effect has often been attributed to differences in age or mass loss on the red - giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "however , canonical simulations show that increasing the assumed age or rgb mass loss will move an hb star blueward , but will _ not _ increase a star s luminosity ( fig .",
    "this indicates that the blue hb population in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 does not arise from either an older cluster age or greater mass loss .",
