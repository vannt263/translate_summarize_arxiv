    "constraining the galactic potential optimally has been a very difficult yet important aspect of studies of the milky way and the local group . understanding the various components of the galactic potential , for instance separating the potential contributions from the baryonic disc and that from the dark matter halo , is fundamental to understanding the history and formation of our own galaxy .",
    "furthermore , understanding the dark halo potential near the sun is a crucial step to pin down the density and thus the scattering cross - section of the dark matter , which in turn is crucial input for interpreting any dark matter annihilation signal at the centre of milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the past few decades , constraining the galactic potential",
    "has mostly relied on the jeans equation ( for a summary , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) despite the known problems of this approach .",
    "for instance , one only keeps the velocity dispersion moments up to second order in the jeans equation . this predicts a gaussian ellipsoid velocity distribution that does not capture the observed and expected asymmetries in the angular velocity @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one of the ways to alleviate these problems is through explicitly modelling the stellar population distribution function ( df ) , either via integrals of motions or actions instead of just taking position ",
    "velocity moments , as is the case of the jeans equation @xcite .",
    "for such modelling , it is crucial that relatively simple analytic dfs , e.g. based on the actions , are reasonably good approximations to the actual orbit distributions for at least subpopulations of stars in the galactic disc .",
    "how well such df approximations work in practice is not yet clear . to explore this question",
    ", we consider in particular stellar subpopulations of a particular age or abundance pattern @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter refer all of these references as bo12 ) showed , using g - dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) survey @xcite , that mono - abundance , stars that have nearly the same [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath1/fe ] , populations have very simple @xmath2 phase - space distribution properties : spatial density distributions that vary exponentially , both in the radial and vertical directions ; furthermore , each mono - abundance population shows isothermal velocity dispersion in the vertical direction and exponentially in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "this simplicity in @xmath2 space gives hope that one could describe mono - abundance populations with simple action - based dfs which is one of the purposes of this study .",
    "since stars are the most abundant tracers of the galactic potential , simple action - based dfs will naturally provide a statistical and rigorous method to constrain the galactic potential because the conversion of position  velocity variable ( configuration space ) to the action  angle variable depends on the parameters of the potential ( see @xcite for generic ground work on the topic ) .",
    "the main idea is to determine the likelihood of the observational data , given a joint set of parameters for both the df and the gravitational potential ; subsequent marginalization over the df parameters provides then a rigorously derived constraint on the potential .",
    "such an approach appears to be a precondition to fully exploit the dynamical information content of large galactic surveys that will provide us spatial and velocity distribution , along with elemental abundances , including the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment @xcite , galactic archaeology survey with hermes ( galah ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and european southern observatory-_gaia _ @xcite .    in the context of dynamically modelling the galactic disc with action - based dfs ,",
    "the goals of the paper are three - fold : explore how well ` mono - abundance populations ' can be approximated by simple action - based analytic dfs ; lay out a formalism that provides constraints from a set of discrete stellar positions and velocities on the gravitational potential , after marginalizing over the df ; forecast what constraints on the _ shape _ of the potential we can expect given existing sample sizes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section[sec : df ] , we discuss the choice of parametrization of the df and summarize the adiabatic approximation that we assume to calculate the action variable efficiently . in section[sec : df - match ] , we will show that our choice of df exhibits all the basic phase - space distribution properties of mono - abundance stars , with the only caveat that disc potential has to be included in order for the vertical spatial profile to fit . in section[sec : constrain_potential ] , we show that by studying the likelihood of the df  potential parameters , one can recover the potential parameters , even under a restrictive and realistic spatial selection function .    throughout this study",

    "we find that the vertical profile is predicted satisfactorily with the miyamoto ",
    "nagai potential ( as shown in fig.[fig : nm_fit ] ) but not with the flattened isothermal potential ( as shown in fig.[fig : log_fit ] ) .",
    "this can be explained by the following . in the case where @xmath98 , the vertical restoring force of the miyamoto  nagai potential and thus @xmath99 is about constant .",
    "this implies that the vertical action is proportional to @xmath100 , and the vertical profile in ansatz equation([eq : df ] ) goes down exponentially . on the other hand ,",
    "the vertical restoring force of the flattened isothermal potential and thus @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "this implies that the vertical action is proportional to @xmath101 , and the vertical profile will go down too drastically [ proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "also note that , in the upper panel of fig.[fig : nm_fit ] , the df predicts a shallower vertical density profile near the galactic plane . as segue does not observe the galactic plane , we can not decide whether this prediction is accurate or one should revise the df to better fit the vertical density profile at this point .",
    "nonetheless , the density distribution is not expected to be exponential all the way to @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "our aim here is to match the exponential profiles in the range of @xmath38 and @xmath100 where segue has data .",

    "in this section , we will show that , given a functional form of the potential and the df , we can recover the optimal potential parameters by marginalizing over the df parameters .",
    "note that in practice , we only observe a very small part of the galaxy . in this study , we assume that the observed volume is a cylinder around the sun with a finite width and height .",

    "we use the results with the sample size @xmath121 to be our reference , because the uncertainty of the potential parameters is @xmath122per cent in this case .",
    "we show that this reference value coincides with the true value , indicating that , assuming a potential model , we can recover the true potential parameter with observation restricted to a small volume .",
    "we show that we can find the best - fitting potential parameters within one- to two - sigma significance from the true value regardless of the sample size .",
    "more importantly , the data constrain a highly degenerate combination of @xmath110 and @xmath111 : since @xmath123 , we find that @xmath124 as seen in fig.[fig : nm_2d_opti_potential ] . on top of that , we show that , with the sample size of @xmath125 , we recover both parameters with a precision of about @xmath126per cent for a @xmath127per cent significance ( two - sigma ) .",
    "the uncertainties are larger than the one in the study of a flattened isothermal potential below because the parameters are highly correlated .",
    "we extend this result to the three - dimensional case by considering the flattened isothermal potential with two parameters ( equation[eq : isothermal_potential ] ) : @xmath14 and @xmath90 .",
    "we choose to constrain only two potential parameters because ( 1 ) the main purpose of this study is to show that we can pin down the two upmost important parameters of the galactic potential around the solar neighbourhood , namely the total mass and the vertical density scaleheight . in this regard , two parameters are sufficient .",
    "( 2 ) while our method is general and could be used to constrain any number of potential parameters , it is computationally expensive to add another dimension in the nested - grid optimization method that we use .",
    "we could have implemented markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) and have increased the efficiency of higher dimensional search , but the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the new method .",
    "we shall leave the mcmc implementation to a later study .",
    "we consider the warm - disc case where @xmath112kpc , @xmath113kpc , @xmath114 and @xmath128 for df in equation([eq : df ] ) .",
    "we create the mock data from the potential with @xmath35 and @xmath129 . as shown in fig.[fig : log_3d_opti_potential ] , one can recover both the circular velocity @xmath14 and the axis ratio @xmath90 successfully with our proposed method .    note that , in most cases , without a galactic dust map , observations in the equatorial galactic disc are less reliable",

    "the result as shown in fig.[fig : log_3d_opti_potential_without_midplane ] shows that we can about equally well constrain the axis ratio @xmath90 and the circular velocity @xmath14 , given the same sample size",
    ". this could be probably due to the fact that our three - dimensional flattened isothermal potential is too restrictive ; therefore , the axis ratio is not too sensitive to the vertical observed volume restriction . in both cases , we show that , with the sample size of @xmath125 , we recover the circular velocity with a precision of about @xmath66per cent for a @xmath127per cent significance ( two - sigma ) and of about @xmath131per cent for the axis ratio .",
    "it is important to note that , in this study , we perform the potential parameter estimation by marginalizing over the df parameters instead of maximizing over the df parameters .",
    "it has been argued that this is the best way to constrain the potential in this type of study @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our study is also the first successful study in implementing this marginalization .",
    "interestingly , we find that by performing marginalization , the results we obtain are almost exactly the same as maximizing over the df parameters .",
    "since marginalization will take at least an order of magnitude more in terms of computational time , it might be worthwhile to explain these results . to illustrate these results",
    ", we consider a two - dimensional parameter space @xmath132 and we marginalize over one of the dimensions .",
    "it is trivial to generalize the arguments to higher dimensions .",
    "if the posterior joint distribution is a two - dimensional joint gaussian probability distribution , assuming flat prior , the posterior probability distribution is given by @xmath133    since this is a monotonic function , the contour of the posterior probability distribution will resemble the contour of @xmath134 .",
    "note that the general formula for a two - dimensional posterior gaussian probability distribution can be written as @xmath135.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can show that the maximum of @xmath136 is obtained at @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , @xmath138    differing only by a multiplicative constant , this is the same as @xmath139    when considering the difference in @xmath134 with respect to the minimum point , the multiplicative constant will drop out .",
    "hence , with all the arguments above , we show that in the marginalized @xmath140 , to obtain the boundary point at which @xmath141 , it is the same as maximizing over parameter @xmath142 , with the assumption that the posterior is a multidimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "to better address the concern of systematic error arising from the use of the adiabatic approximation in the potential parameter estimation , we also perform an identical study with mock data generated using the torus machinery ( mcmillan & binney , private communication ) .",
    "the torus machinery @xcite , compared to the adiabatic approximation , is an more accurate method of calculating actions .",
    "we find that the best - fitting parameters ( recovered assuming the adiabatic approximation ) , in this case , are slightly shifted ( about @xmath66per cent ) compared to the input parameters ( generated using the torus machinery ) .",
    "this is probably due to the error in calculating actions with the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we conclude that more accurate and efficient ways of calculating actions are very valuable in improving our analysis ; however , our analysis with the adiabatic approximation only introduces a non - significant error .    , but with the vertical range of available tracer constraints restricted to @xmath143kpc  the mid - plane is cutout : this is a more realistic selection function since in most cases , without a galactic dust map , observations in the equatorial galactic disc are less reliable . ]    we also test our method by shifting the galactocentric frame velocities by @xmath144 , mimicking the uncertainty due to the solar motion .",
    "we find that all the results presented in this paper remain to be qualitatively similar , with the only difference that the estimated circular velocity of the galactic potential will be shifted by the same amount .",
    "more importantly , when the galactocentric frame is shifted by a larger amount , the maximum likelihood decreases more , accordingly .",
    "therefore , if we consider the solar motion to be another free parameter in the fit , we could study the most probable solar motion with our proposed method and put an independent constraint on the true solar motion in the galactocentric frame .",
    "bo12 show that the galactic disc , when decomposed into mono - abundance populations , contains cold populations ( i.e. smaller velocity dispersion ) as well as warmer populations .",
    "to compare the constraints which we can obtain from different populations , we study the three - dimensional miyamoto  nagai potential .",
    "we consider a warm population with @xmath114 , @xmath128 as before , and a cold population with @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "we fit for @xmath147 ( the scaleheight ) and @xmath110 ( the total mass ) , but fix @xmath111 ( the scalelength ) to keep the computational cost down ( see above ) .",
    "we find that cold populations constrain the total mass @xmath110 better and also constrain slightly better the scaleheight @xmath147 .",
    "the result is expected for @xmath110 because it is related to the circular velocity .",
    "one should be able to pin down the circular velocity better if the dispersion of the velocity is smaller .",
    "we interpret the result for the scaleheight as follows : there are two competing effects for the scaleheight estimation : ( 1 ) the warm populations probe a wider range in height , given the same selection function ; ( 2 ) the cold populations can pin down the trajectories / orbits better .",
    "we find that in our case , the latter effect slightly dominates the former .",
    "however , the results should be viewed with caution .",
    "the results could be biased because ( 1 ) our model might be too restrictive , ( 2 ) the selection function that we choose ( @xmath148kpc ) is larger than the galactic scaleheight ; therefore , there is not much gain in probing a wider range in height . with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we find that colder populations are more valuable in the study of the galactic potential with our proposed method .",
    "we demonstrate a way to constrain the galactic potential from mono - abundance stellar populations .",
    "we show that the phase - space distribution properties of mono - abundance stars can be fitted very well with a simple action - based df . assuming that the vertical and radial velocity dispersion scalelengths are the same , these properties are fully determined by only four df parameters .",
    "we further show that , assuming that the proposed df is the true representation of the mono - abundance populations and certain parametrization of the galactic potential , we devise a statistical and rigorous method to measure the galactic potential parameters .",
    "this is achieved by calculating the likelihood of observational data , given a joint set of parameters for both the df and the gravitational potential and subsequently marginalizing over the df parameters .",
    "@xcite perform a rigorous test on the method we propose in this paper and confirm that our method has significant advantages on both the uncertainty in the potential parameter estimation and the computational time .",
    "we create a mock data sample from the df with various potentials , including the miyamoto  nagai in - plane potential and a flattened isothermal potential .",
    "we show that even with a mono - abundance sample of the size of a few thousands , given a two - parameter gravitational potential , we can pin down the potential parameters to a few per cent .    in this study , we assume that the measurement is perfect without uncertainty in the position and velocity measurements",
    ". the inclusion of measurement uncertainty should be conceptually straightforward .",
    "although a more realistic potential , for instance a combination of halo , bulge and disc potential , will contain more than two parameters and hence post a challenge to the estimation , different mono - abundance stars are tracing the same galactic potential and therefore their joint constraints with the method we propose are still very promising . in the current available segue survey , considering an elemental abundance bin of [ fe / h]@xmath149 and @xmath150=0.05 $ ] , we have about @xmath151@xmath152 tracers per bin . in the future ,",
    "when galah is fully operational , we expect to have about @xmath153 tracers per bin . in practice ,",
    "when dealing with multiple mono - abundance populations , one can combine the constraints from different populations by multiplying the individual likelihoods marginalized over the df parameters .",
    "the assumptions of axisymmetry , of dfs that are smooth in the actions and no time variation remain important limitations in our current study . to tackle some of these aspects ,",
    "we have started analysing data from the large @xmath154-body simulation described in @xcite , which has strong , time - dependent spiral structure . as a preliminary result",
    ", we find that , even with realistic levels of non - axisymmetry and time variation of the potential , the method still works , but we plan to describe this in a later paper for a more concrete and rigorous analysis of this problem .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments .",

    "<S> we present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the galactic potential based on the phase - space information for many individual stars . such an approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic surveys of the galaxy and in the future _ gaia_. this approach describes the orbit distribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function ( df ) proposed by mcmillan and binney , which are based on actions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these parametrized dfs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase - space distributions of individual abundance - selected galactic subpopulations of stars ( ` mono - abundance populations ' ) for a disc - like gravitational potential , which enables independent dynamical constraints from each of the galactic mono - abundance populations .    </S>",
