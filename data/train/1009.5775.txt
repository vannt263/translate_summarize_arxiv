    "the study of phase transformation between liquid and crystal through a nucleation and subsequent growth regime is a problem with a very long history @xcite . understanding the crystallization process , including the rate of phase transition and the morphology of the crystal formed , has a great importance for many technological applications .",

    "the generally established outcome here , which confirms the experimental observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , is that the shear drive can have a significant impact on the various aspects of the nonequilibrium phase transitions , in particular , on the transition , nucleation and crystal growth rates as well as on the induction time @xcite .    in terms of nucleation",
    ", the influence of a finite shear rate on the structural ordering of a system appears to be , in general , that a small shear rate speeds up nucleation , while larger shear rates prevent ordering @xcite .",
    "fluid - crystal coexistence can also be affected by shear , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite where crystallization is shown to be suppressed by flow .",
    "hence , the shear flow influences both the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects of nucleation , in a way that may depend on the depth of supercooling and on the intensity of the strain rate , presumably compared to the system internal relaxation time . for a deeply supercooled , glassy system , the relaxation time is essentially infinite , so that a finite shear rate will always have a favorable impact on nucleation .    the cluster growth process , which follows nucleation , is also expected to be affected by a finite strain rate . for a specific ,",
    "ising like , two - dimensional system , it was shown recently that a moderate shear - drive plays a significant role in crystal erosion and growth governing by single `` particle '' attachment and coalescence processes @xcite .",
    "more generally , one may inquire how the domain growth law are affected by the shear rate . in systems at rest , the standard description for the apparition of a crystalline phase through nucleation and cluster growth , is generally reproduced by the classical kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) theory @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the extension of the kjma theory for the case of the time - dependent nucleation and growth in a model metallic glass under shear drive .",
    "extension of the theory is tested together with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation data at different temperatures and wide range of shear rates .",

    "moreover , the maximum in potential reflects the first of the friedel oscillations and favors icosahedral local order in the system , therefore making it a good glass - former at low pressure @xcite .",
    "the system under study and the simulation setup are completely identical to the considered one in ref .",
    "namely , the system consists of @xmath19 particles within the simulation box @xmath20 with @xmath21 that corresponds to the density @xmath22 .",
    "a set of glassy samples is prepared by fast cooling from the equilibrated liquid state to the temperatures @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 that is well below the melting point @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the shear drive is applied by moving two amorphous walls created at the sides of the simulation cell perpendicular to the @xmath27 direction .",

    "the critical cluster size @xmath77 is one of the crucial parameters in nucleation theories .",
    "since the critical clusters are undetectable by the common traditional experimental tools , especially at the high supercoolings corresponding to a glassy phase , advanced methods must be used to define the critical cluster size and to clarify the question about subcritical cluster morphology ( see review @xcite ) . here",
