    "for a@xmath2@xmath348 , the compound nucleus ( cn ) so formed decays subsequently by the emission of mainly the lps ( n , p , @xmath4 and @xmath5-rays ) , and a significant ( 5 - 10% ) decay strength is observed for the complex imfs .",
    "the measured angular distributions and energy spectra for imfs are consistent with fission - like decays of the respective cn .",
    "the statistical hauser feshbach ( hf ) analysis , given for lps emission , is also used to include the imfs emission ( busco code @xcite , or the extended hf scission - point model ( ehfm ) @xcite ) . for imfs ,",
    "a more accepted process is the binary fission of the cn ( fusion - fission ) , worked out in the statistical scission - point fission model @xcite or the saddle - point `` transition - state '' model ( tsm ) @xcite , with the lps still treated within the hf method .",
    "the recently advanced dynamical cluster - decay model ( dcm ) @xcite include the missing structure information of the statistical fission models , by taking each fragment ( lp or imf ) preformed in the cn , which subsequently follows the dynamical cluster - decay process rather than the fission process of the statistical model .",
    "the structure information influences the observed yields strongly through the observed strong resonance behaviour in the measured excitation functions of large - angle elastic and inelastic scattering yields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which enters the dcm via the preformation probability of the fragments .",
    "the dcm for hot and rotating compound systems is a reformulation of the preformed cluster model ( pcm ) of gupta et al .",
    "@xcite for ground - state decays , briefly developed in section 2 .",
    "the application of dcm to @xmath6s+@xmath7mg@xmath8@xmath9ni@xmath10 is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the @xmath9ni@xmath10 has a negative q - value ( q@xmath11 ) , with experimental mass distributions of both lps and imfs being available @xcite .",
    "the model has also been applied successfully for the positive q - value @xmath12 system .",
    "a summary of our results is presented in section 4 .",
    "the dcm uses collective coordinates of mass ( charge ) asymmetry @xmath13=(a@xmath14-a@xmath15)/(a@xmath14+a@xmath15 ) ( @xmath16=(z@xmath14-z@xmath15)/(z@xmath14+z@xmath15 ) ) , and relative separation r , characterizing , respectively , the nucleon - exchange between the outgoing fragments , and the incident channel kinetic energy ( e@xmath17 ) transferred to internal excitation of outgoing channel ( e@xmath2+q@xmath11(t)=tke(t)+txe(t ) ; txe and tke as the total excitation and kinetic energy ) , since r@xmath18r(t,@xmath13 ) . for decoupled r-,@xmath13-motions , in terms of partial waves , the fragment formation or cn decay cross - section @xmath19",
    "the preformation probability p@xmath20 , refering to @xmath13-motion , is the solution of stationary schrd- inger eqn . in @xmath13 ( with t - dependent collective fragmentation potentials @xcite ) , at a fixed @xmath21    = 6.8 in    c@xmath22 are ssmann radii and t is from e@xmath2=e@xmath17+q@xmath23=@xmath24t@xmath25-t .",
    "@xmath26(t ) , the only parameter of model , simulating the two - centre nuclear shape , is similar to neck - length used in statistical models @xcite .",
    "the penetrability p , refering to r - motion , is the wkb integral , with v(r@xmath27)=v(r@xmath28)=q@xmath29 .",
    "r@xmath28 is second turning point .",
    "q@xmath29 , the effective q - value or tke(t,@xmath30=0 ) , is q@xmath29(t)=b(t)-[b@xmath14(t=0)+b@xmath15(t=0)]=tke(t)=v(r@xmath27 ) , for the cn at t to decay to two observed cold fragments ( t=0 ) .",
    "this transition occurs by emitting lps of energy e@xmath31=b(t)-b(0)=q@xmath29(t)-q@xmath11(t=0 ) . instead",

    "fig . 1 gives the variation of @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath30 for both the lps ( @xmath37 ) and imfs ( a@xmath38 ) refering to energetically favoured fragments .",
    "interestingly , the behaviour of lps is different from that of the imfs ; whereas for lps @xmath35 decreases with increase of @xmath30 , for imfs it increases as @xmath30 increases and then starts to decrease at a large @xmath30-value .",
    "thus , lps contribute to @xmath35 for smaller @xmath30-values whereas the same for imfs is important for higher @xmath30 s ( @xmath39 ) . similarly , the @xmath36 s for lps are large at all @xmath30-values , whereas the same for @xmath40 is nearly zero for all imfs .",
    "this means that the lower @xmath30 s contribute only towards lps cross - section @xmath41 and the higher @xmath30 s ( @xmath39 ) to fission - like , imfs cross - section @xmath42 , as shown in fig .",
    "the total cross - section @xmath43 is also plotted , and the summed up cross - sections are given in braces , to be compared with experiments .",
    "2(b ) illustrates the contributions of individual imfs .",
    "apparently , the lighter imfs contribute more than the heavier imfs towards @xmath42 , pointing to the observed favourable asymmetric mass distribution .",
    "interestingly , similar results , as presented by figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , are obtained by the statistical fission model @xcite ( see e.g. fig .",
    "14 in @xcite ) .",
    "3(a ) shows the summed up @xmath44 for decay of @xmath9ni@xmath10 at @xmath4551.6 mev to both the lps and even - a , n = z imfs , along with the tsm and ehfm calculations , compared with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the tsm and ehfm for lps are the hf results , whereas the dcm treats both the lps and imfs emissions on similar footings .",
    "for the lps emission , the measured @xmath46 mb but the separate yield for each emitted light particle is not available for a direct comparison .",
    "first of all , we notice in fig .",
    "3(a ) that the unphysical discontinuity at the point between @xmath474 and 6 in tsm is not present in our dcm results . in dcm",
    ", @xmath41 is over - estimated by a large factor of @xmath485 , a discrepancy that gets removed if mass - one - particle ( proton ) is replaced with neutron , for example .",
    "this signifies the importance of the contributing particles to @xmath41 . for the imfs ,",
    "the general comparison between the data and dcm is of similar quality as for the tsm or ehfm model , at least for @xmath49 .",
    "the use of @xmath50 improves the comparison slightly .",
    "3(b ) shows the average @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , compared with experimental data @xcite .",
    "apparently , the comparisons are reasonably good .",
    "the maximum @xmath30-value is less than @xmath53-value , which may be due to the use of @xmath26 instead of actual @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamical collective clusterization is shown as an alternative good decay process for both the lps and imfs produced in low energy reactions .",
    "the imfs are shown to be produced as clusters , like in cluster radioactivity , but from excited cn .",
    "the lps are also considered to be of the same origin , without invoking any statistical evaporation process .    9 j. gomez del campo , et al .",
