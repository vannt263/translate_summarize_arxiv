    "by starting with the boltzmann equation , valet and fert constructed the macroscopic model of the cpp - gmr@xcite , on which our calculation is based . before showing our results",
    ", we shall give a brief introduction to the valet - fert theory of cpp - gmr .",
    "in the macroscopic model of the cpp - gmr , it is assumed that the conduction electrons with spins @xmath1 can be characterized by the conductivity @xmath2 , spin relaxation rate @xmath3 , density of states @xmath4 and diffusion constant @xmath5 . since we consider a collinear alignment of the magnetizations we neglect the mixing of spin - up and spin - down bands .",
    "the current density for each spin band under an electric field @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the charge of an electron and @xmath9 represents the accumulation of the electrons with spin @xmath10 . by using einstein s relation @xmath11 ,",
    "we can rewrite as @xmath12 introducing the deviation of the spin - dependent chemical potential from the equilibrium state @xmath13 , the accumulation @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath14 . since the electric field is given by the gradient of the electrostatic potential @xmath15 as @xmath16 , it is convenient to define the spin - dependent electro - chemical potential as @xmath17",
    ". hence the current density can be written as @xmath18    in the ferromagnetic materials , the spin - polarization of the conductivity is represented by the parameter @xmath19 which is defined as @xmath20 . for example , the spin - polarization parameter @xmath21 for co @xcite",
    "the equations that determine electro - chemical potentials are derived by the continuity equations for charge and spin . the continuity equation for charge",
    "is given by @xmath22 which means that there is no source for electron charge .",
    "the continuity equation for spin is given by @xmath23 which means that the spin relaxation plays a role of spin source .",
    "substituting into and we obtain the following diffusion equations for electro - chemical potentials    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the characteristic length of the spin diffusion called `` spin diffusion length '' .",
    "the spin diffusion length is defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the averaged spin relaxation time defined as @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the averaged diffusion constant defined as @xmath30 .    by solving and with proper boundary conditions ,",
    "we obtain the electrochemical potential and therefore the total resistance of the system .",
    "the mr ratio is defined by the total resistance for the parallel alignment of the magnetizations @xmath31 , and that for the anti - parallel alignment @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "let us first consider the mr ratio of the conventional cpp - gmr spin - valves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) . the nonmagnetic ( n )",
    "spacer layer is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic ( f ) electrodes .",
    "the magnetization of the top electrode is assumed to be fixed at a certain direction and the magnetization of the bottom electrode is aligned to be parallel or anti - parallel to that of the top electrode .",
    "can be expressed as a parallel circuit of the effective resistances .",
    "( c ) mr ratio is plotted against the resistivity of the non - magnetic layer @xmath34 .",
    "( d ) mr ratio is plotted against the ratio of the effective resistances @xmath35 . ]",
    "we assume the translational invariance in the @xmath36 and @xmath37directions and the current is flowing perpendicular to the plane , i.e. , in the @xmath38direction .",
    "hence the equations to be solved reduce to a couple of one - dimensional diffusion equations : @xmath39 the general solutions of and are obtained as @xmath40 where @xmath41 s are arbitrary integration constants determined by the proper boundary conditions .",
    "we neglect the effect of interfacial scattering for simplicity .",
    "then we adopt the boundary conditions such that both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are continuous at the interface . after some algebra",
    ", we can show that the total resistance for parallel alignment of the magnetizations @xmath31 , and that for the anti - parallel alignment @xmath32 , have the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the thickness of the f(n ) layer , @xmath47 is the cross - section area of the system , and @xmath48 is the resistivity of the f(n ) layer defined as @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the conductivity for electrons with spin @xmath10 in the f ( n ) layer .",
    "@xmath51 is the total resistance of the system in the absence of the spin accumulation and independent of the magnetization configuration . the additional resistance @xmath52 originates from the voltage drop at the interfaces due to the spin accumulation , which has the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the effective resistances for f and n layers defined as @xmath56.\\ ] ] the function @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . from , @xmath52 is considered as a parallel circuit of the effective resistances @xmath54 and @xmath60 as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) , we plot the mr ratio against the resistivity of the non - magnetic layer @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the f layer is made of cofe and the n layer is made of cu . for numerical calculation , we use the following values : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 . the thickness of the f - layer @xmath67 is taken to be thick enough compared with the spin diffusion length @xmath68 in order to eliminate the spin accumulation at the bottom and the top electrodes .",
    "one can obviously see that the mr ratio takes its maximum value at a certain value of @xmath34 and vanishes in both limits of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the limit of @xmath69 , the effective resistance of n - layer",
    "@xmath60 is much larger than that of f - layer @xmath54 and the interface resistance @xmath52 equals to @xmath71 for both p and ap cases , which means that the mr ratio goes to zero .",
    "conversely , in the limit of @xmath70 , @xmath60 is much smaller than @xmath54 and the interface resistance @xmath52 goes to zero .",
    "therefore the mr ratio vanishes also in this limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) , the mr ratio is plotted against the ratio of the effective resistance @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the effective resistance of n - layer for an f / n bilayer system . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) , the mr ratio is maximized if the effective resistances @xmath54 and @xmath74 are balanced with each other , i.e. , @xmath75 . a similar idea is also applicable to the ccp - cpp - gmr system as will be discussed in the next section .    .",
    "next we move onto the ccp - cpp spin - valves , where the spacer layer is made of an nol with a lot of nanometer - size metallic channels .",
    "the system we consider is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "a narrow non - magnetic metallic contact is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "the cross - sectional view of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the curve of the contact region is modeled by the half ellipse , which is tangent to the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "the length of the major axis of the ellipse , which is the same as the thickness of the contact , is taken to be 2 nm . the length of the semi - minor axis of the ellipse is 0.5 nm .",
    "the f electrodes are assumed to be 40 nm x 40 nm x 45 nm rectangles .    in our calculation",
    "we keep the shape of the ellipse fixed and vary the size of the contact by changing the contact radius @xmath76 .",
    "the electro - chemical potentials are determined by numerically solving and by use of the finite element method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the system is divided into hexahedral elements and the total number of the elements is of the order of 10@xmath77 .",
    "we assume that the f electrodes and n contact are made of cofe and cu , respectively .",
    "we use the same material parameters we used in the previous section for the conventional cpp - gmr spin - valve system .",
    "the resistivity of cu is assumed to be @xmath7817 , 50 , 170 and 300 @xmath79 .",
    "the obtained mr ratios of the ccp - cpp - gmr system are plotted against the contact radius @xmath76 in fig .",
    "one can immediately see that the mr ratio increases with decreasing the resistivity of cu , @xmath80 .",
    "it has been considered so far that the mr ratio shows monotone increasing with decreasing the contact radius both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "we note that there is a contact radius that maximize the mr ratio , which is indicated by a circle in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for given values of @xmath80 and the mr ratio vanishes in the limit of @xmath81 .",
    "[ fig3 ] also shows that the value of the contact radius that maximize the mr ratio decreases with decreasing the resistivity of cu .    .",
    "the resistivity of cu in the contact is varied from 17 @xmath82 nm to 300 @xmath82 nm .",
    "the mr ratio takes a maximum value at a certain value of the contact radius which is indicated by a circle . ]    strictly speaking , the boltzmann approach loses its validity in the limit @xmath83 , especially in the region @xmath84 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the electron transport across a narrow metallic channel with the width of a single atom is studied based on the landauer formalism , where it is concluded that mr ratio is diminished by the quantum interference .",
    "this does not contradict our results that mr goes to zero in the limit @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) , we plot the mr ratios against the resistance area product ( ra ) . this behavior is qualitatively consistent with the experimental results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the difference of the absolute scale of the mr ratio between our theory and experimental results is due to the absence of high - resistance electrode layers in our theory , which decreases the mr ratio . in the experiment ,",
    "the total ra of the electrode layers is estimated to be about @xmath85 .",
    "if we take into account this extra resistance , the mr ratio goes down to 10% with the ra of a few hundred @xmath86 , which quantitatively agrees with the one obtained in the experiment .",
    "are plotted against the resistance area product ( ra ) .",
    "( b ) mr ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are plotted against the ratio of the effective resistances @xmath87 . in both panels ,",
    "circles indicate the maximum value of the mr ratio for each value of @xmath80 . ]",
    "the value of the contact radius that maximize the mr ratio can be qualitatively explained by considering the effective circuit shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) . for the ccp - cpp - gmr spin - valve , the resistance of the nol layer increases with decreasing the radius of the contact . in the effective circuit model shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) , the change of the contact radius can be realized by the corresponding change of effective resistance .",
    "since the thickness of the n - layer @xmath88 is much smaller than the spin diffusion length @xmath89 , we can employ the following approximations : @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath76 is the contact radius .",
    "based on this consideration , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) , we plot the mr ratio against the ratio of the effective resistances @xmath92 .",
    "it is observed that the mr ratio is maximized when the effective resistances @xmath54 and @xmath93 are balanced with each other , i.e. , @xmath94 .    finally we shall discuss the effect of the spin - dependent interfacial scattering which is represented by the spin - dependent interfacial resistance @xmath95 in the macroscopic model of the cpp - gmr @xcite . the boundary conditions for electro - chemical potentials at the interface located at @xmath96 are given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath38component of the current density and the spin - dependent interfacial resistance @xmath95 are defined as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the interfacial spin asymmetry coefficient and @xmath101 is the total interfacial resistance .    in our calculation , the spin - dependent interfacial scattering is realized by introducing fictitious layers with thickness @xmath102 , resistivity @xmath103 , spin polarization of the conductivity @xmath104 , and with the infinite spin diffusion length @xmath105 .",
    "we carried out the same calculations as shown in figs [ fig3 ] taking into account of the spin - dependent interfacial scattering at both sides of the contact .",
    "the parameters are taken to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results are qualitatively same as those shown in in figs [ fig3 ]",
    ". however , the contact radius that maximize the mr ratio decreases due to the spin - dependent interfacial scattering . for @xmath108 , for example , the contact radius that maximize the mr ratio decreases as @xmath109 nm @xmath110 nm .",
    "in conclusion , we theoretically study the magnetoresistance of a ccp - cpp - gmr system by numerically solving the diffusion equations for spin - dependent electro - chemical potentials in three - dimensional ccp geometry .",
    "we show that the mr ratio is not a monotone function of the contact radius but takes a maximum value at a certain value of the contact radius .",
    "we also show that the value of contact radius that maximize the mr ratio is qualitatively understood by considering matching of the effective resistances .",
