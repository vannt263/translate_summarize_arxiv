    "using the work of chang and skjelbred @xcite , goresky , kottwitz and macpherson in @xcite established the gkm theory , saying that the equivariant cohomology of certain algebraic varieties with complex torus actions can explicitly be calculated in terms of their associated labeled regular graphs ( also called _ gkm graphs _ ) .",
    "this indicates that there is an essential link between torus actions and the combinatorics of labeled regular graphs .",
    "later on , tolman and weitsman @xcite gave a simple proof of this result in the symplectic setting , and showed that such gkm graphs can be produced from a kind of @xmath7-manifolds ( called the gkm manifolds ) .",
    "in subsequent works ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) , guillemin and zara developed the gkm theory combinatorially . in @xcite , biss ,",
    "guillemin and holm studied the mod 2 version of the gkm theory , and showed that a mod 2 gkm manifold can still be associated to a unique labeled graph ( called the mod 2 gkm graph ) , and its equivariant cohomology can be read out from this graph , where a mod 2 gkm manifold @xmath8 is the real locus of a gkm symplectic manifold @xmath9 with a hamiltonian @xmath7-action , which is the fixed point set of an anti - symplectic involution ( compatible with the @xmath7-action ) on @xmath9 .",

    "for example , guillemin and holm in @xcite established the gkm theory for torus actions with nonisolated fixed points , and goldin and holm in @xcite generalized the gkm theory to the case in which the one - skeleton has dimension at most 4 , so the mod 2 gkm theory may be generalized to the case in which the one - skeleton has dimension at most 2 ( see @xcite ) , where the one - skeleton of a @xmath7-manifold ( resp .",

    "[ classification ] up to equivariant cobordism , @xmath988 gives all possible nonbounding actions in @xmath972 where @xmath989 and @xmath915 .",

    "without loss of generality assume that @xmath240 has exactly four fixed points .",
