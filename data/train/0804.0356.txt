    "it is evident from many experiments@xcite that the superconductivity of the high-@xmath0 cuprates can be described at low energies and temperatures by a bcs theory with effective interactions between square - lattice quasiparticles that lead to short - coherence - length @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",

    "none of these arguments are sufficently quantitative to favor the @xmath107 model choice over the @xmath124 choice , commonly used in @xmath125 model calculations and motivated by the theory of the superexchange mechanism .",

    "we close this section by commenting briefly on the role of inter - channel berry phase coupling , which has often been neglected in theoretical analyses , in determining the insr position and character .",
    "when only the spin - channel is included the equation for the resonance frequency is @xmath128 .",
    "because of the weak energy dependence of @xmath37 below the particle - hole continuum we see that when coupling is ignored , @xmath129 has to be adjusted to more than @xmath130 of @xmath37 to explain the resonance position , placing the system even closer to the antiferromagnetic state instability point . for a given value of the interaction stregth , mode coupling substantially lowers the resonance frequency .",
    "mode coupling is therefore important in explaining the experimental relationship between the value of the resonance frequency and the proximity of the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "this work starts from the observation that in the low - temperature limit cuprates act like ordinary superconductors with elementary quasiparticle excitations that are describable by bcs theory .",
    "arpes experiments find a fermi surface with area proportional to electron doping @xmath131 , rather than hole - doping @xmath43 and a fermi velocity which shows no sign@xcite of declining with @xmath43 .",
    "the most remarkable feature of cuprate superconductors at low - temperatures is the sharp collective excitation which appears at wavevectors near @xmath132 in neutron - studies of quantum spin - fluctuations .",
    "the apparently banal character of the low - energy excitations suggests that the ground state of these superconductors can be described using a weak - coupling theory in which the quasiparticles seen in arpes experiments interact in a way which leads to both d - wave superconductivity and the inelastic neutron scattering mode .",
    "given this starting point , it is natural to ask if quantitative comparison with experiments gives any indication as to the character of the presumably renormalized interactions which appear in this low - energy effective theory . in making this assessment ,",
    "it is important to acknowledge that the properties of cuprate superconductors are not entirely universal , and not all experimental data is available on any one material .",
    "nevertheless we judge that well established broad trends allow generic conclusions .",
    "the numbers mentioned below are intended to apply most closely to the bi2212 cuprate family .    in order to make progress toward identifing the renormalized interactions it seems to be necessary to start by limiting the forms which can reasonably be considered .",
    "the fact of singlet d - wave superconductivity on the cuprate square lattice appears to require either spin - independent attractive interactions ( possibly due to phonons ) or spin - dependent antiferromagnetic heisenberg interactions ( possibly due to short - range antiferromagnetic order ) between electrons on neighbouring sites .",
    "the proximity of a mott insulator state for hole - doping @xmath133 would seem to require allowing for the possibility of a strongly repulsive on - site hubbard - like interaction @xmath4 . we have therefore considered how the properties of the system depend on all three parameters @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . the simplest experimental constraint on this parameter set is imposed by the magnitude of the d - wave antinodal gap which , when combined with the band - structure known from arpes , constrains @xmath134 to a value @xmath135 which increases moderately with decreasing @xmath43 as summarized in table i.    an understanding of the implications of the strong insr at @xmath132 requires a more subtle analysis . in a weak - coupling theory we can determine collective excitation properties by examining the influence of interactions on single particle - hole excitations . as explained in section iii , for the case",

    "the strength for @xmath3 is comparable to the strength of the superexchange interactions in the undoped antiferromagnetic insulator state of the cuprates .",
    "the effective interactions that are consistent with experiment are therefore similar to the effective interactions which appear@xcite in @xmath125 models , intended to describe quasiparticles which live nearly entirely in the gutzwiller projected@xcite no - double - occupancy hubbard - model subspace .",
    "the absence of a large hubbard replusion @xmath4 in the effective interaction is also expected for quasiparticles which avoid this strong interaction by residing dominantly in the no - double - occupancy subspace .",
    "any other choice of interaction model requires improbable fine - tuning to achieve consistency with the main experimental facts .",
    "the consistency of the @xmath3-only interaction model with arpes and insr data partially affirms one of the main - pictures@xcite of cuprate superconductivity , namely that it emerges from the antiferromagnetic interactions in the parent @xmath133 mott insulator state when holes in the lower hubbard band become itinerant at sufficiently large doping .",
    "there are , however , at this point major challenges which still stand in the way of a fully consistent theoretical picture to accompany this scenario .",
    "mean - field - theory slave - boson and other related formulations@xcite of the @xmath125 model , for example , tend to lead to quasiparticle band widths which decreases wtih hole - doping and to superfluid density which is strictly proportional to hole - doping @xmath43 .",
    "these predictions are , however , clearly at odds with arpes@xcite and penetration - depth@xcite temperature - dependence observations , both of which indicate that the fermi velocity has a weak doping dependence and that the penetration depth vanishes at a rather large value of hole - doping .",
    "a second theoretical approach motivated by the @xmath125 model proceeds from the _ ansatz _ that the superconducting state can be described by gutzwiller - projected bcs paired states@xcite .",
    "variational monte carlo calculations@xcite have demonstrated that the gutswiller - projected bcs wavefunction reproduces a variety of quantities observed in experiments .",
    "furthermore , using the gutzwiller approximation@xcite , the effect of the gutzwiller projector can be replaced approximately by doping - dependent band energy and interaction renormalization factors , leading to mean - field equations similar to those of slave - boson mean - field theories and of the same form as those of the weak - coupling bcs theory .",
    "this simple approximation can reproduce the results of the variational monte carlo studies to a remarkable degree . as a result ,",
    "the _ plain vanilla _ theory helps provides a theoretical explanation for weak - coupling low - energy behavior in the superconducting state with effective interaction parameters that arise in a complex way from the correlated fluctuations of higher energy degrees of freedom . from this point of view , our main finding in this paper is that the same interactions are also quantitatively consistent with the insr feature .",
    "in addition , as we have shown@xcite previously , the pairing wavevector dependence of these low - energy antiferromagnetic fluctuations , provides a natural explanation for the fact that the superfluid density goes to zero at a finite value of hole - doping .",
    "one very interesting property of cuprate superconductivities is that the fermi velocity remains nearly constant throughout the underdoped regime , even as@xcite the superfluid density and the low - frequency infrared spectral - weight weight decline , presumably reflecting in part a decrease in the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath139 .",
    "although this property is reproduced by gutswiller projected variational monte - carlo calculations@xcite , it seems surprising from a perturbation theory point of view that @xmath139 should decline to a small value without a corresponding decrease in fermi velocity ; large values for the energy - dependence of the self - energy can easily arise from small energy denominators associated with resonances near the fermi energy , but it is not so obvious how correspondingly large values for the wavevector - dependence of the self - energy could arise .",
    "we suspect that the quasiparticle renormalization factor in the cuprates is not as small as suggested by the gutzwiller - projected bcs state _",
    "ansatz_.    another very interesting property of cuprate superconductores is the _ marginal fermi liquid _ behavior which often occurs when superconductivity is supressed by temperature ( in the overdoped regime ) or by a magnetic field .",
    "_ marginal fermi liquid _",
    "behavior suggests that quasiparticles are strongly coupled to very - low - energy bosonic excitations , or that the system would be very close to a quantum phase transition if superconductivity was suppressed .",
    "it seems likely to be more than a coincidence that in the low - energy effective model we have extracted from experiment , the cuprates would be very close to antiferromagnetism throughout much of the superconducting dome if they did not form a superconducting state .",
    "this statement is quantified in the appendix in which we discuss quantitative aspects of the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism .",
    "decreasing the gap @xmath140 decreases @xmath137 by approximately 50 mev , just the amount required to reach the antiferromagnetic instability . because superconductivity supresses antiferromagnetism , pair - condensation must raise a part of the electron - electron interaction energy .",
    "this property may be part of the explanation for the apparent increase@xcite in kinetic energy in the superconducting state .    in conclusion",
    ", we have performed a weak - coupling analysis of arpes and insr experiments in bi2212 , in an effort to indentify an effective interaction model which is consistent with both experiments .",
    "we find that the doping dependences of the superconducting gap , and the insr energy @xmath96 can be consistently explained by a model with near - neighbor heisenberg interactions with a strength that is consistent with superexchange interactions .",
    "this result suggests that strong short - range repulsion and incoherent remnants of the antiferromagnetic insulating parent compound are key to high - temperature superconductivity .",

    "numerical evaluation of @xmath141 as a function of @xmath104 for the doping @xmath142 using eq .",
    "[ chi0 ] . ]    in this appendix we explain in more detail how @xmath1-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism compete in a weak coupling grpa theory .",
    "as pointed out in an earlier paper@xcite , this competition is responsible for a correlation induced suppression of the superfluid density as antiferromagnetism is approached .",
    "the quantum zero point energy associated with the collective fluctuations probed in insr experiments is given approximately by : @xmath143 where the prime refers to the sum over wavevectors near @xmath144 for which the berry curvature @xmath145 is large .",
    "@xmath146 are adiabatic limit stiffnesses which equal @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively .",
    "the correlation contribution to the superfluid density is then given by@xcite : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the norm of the pairing wavevector of the bcs wavefunction .",
    "( we explain below why the @xmath150 dependence of @xmath36 is much stronger than the @xmath150 dependence of @xmath117 . )",
    "since both @xmath151 and @xmath152 are positive quantities , @xmath153 determines the sign of @xmath154 . using the chain rule leads to @xmath155 because we know that d - wave superconductivity is weakened by pair - breaking effect of finite @xmath150 doppler shifts on nodal quasiparticles",
    "we can conclude that @xmath156 .",
    "a positive value for @xmath157 characterizes competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "when the two orders compete , the energy cost of antiferromagnetic fluctuations is increased when superconductivity strengthens . in other words",
    ", @xmath102 will increase as @xmath104 increases , giving @xmath158 in this case . to confirm the competing nature of these interactions",
    ", we have performed a numerical calculation of @xmath104 dependence of @xmath102 . since @xmath159 ,",
    "the @xmath104 dependence of @xmath102 comes entirely from @xmath160 .",
    "[  [ fig : four ] ] plots @xmath141 as a function of @xmath104 for doping @xmath142 as an example .",
    "@xmath141 clearly increases monotonically with @xmath104 , consistent with the competing order picture discussed above .",
    "it is important to realize that the relative change in @xmath102 is larger than the relative chance in @xmath141 by apprxoximately a factor of ten because of the interaction contributions to the inverse response functions .",
    "we have shown separately@xcite that the size of this effect combined with the reduction in @xmath104 at finite @xmath150 can explain the large reduction in superfluid densities compared with mean - field theory values in underdoped cuprates .",
    "our demonstration that superconductivity and antiferromagnetism complete in the effective weak - coupling picture of cuprate superconductors contradicts the the conclusion of zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite who state that weak - coupling theory predicts an enhancement of antiferromagnetism due to @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "our calculation shows that their conclusion is not valid when the the normal state fermi surface is similar to what is observed in bi2212 systems . as pointed out by tchernyshyov _",
    "_ , the response functions @xmath161 at @xmath44 are dominated by the _ hot spots _ located near @xmath162 .",
    "if this is true , @xmath163 .",
    "this crude argument is consistent with @xmath164 , and very crudely consistent with fig .",
    "[  [ fig : four ] ] .",
    "the character of the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism is dependent on the normal state band structure .",
    "this dependence is likely responsible for some of the differences between hole - doped and electron - doped cuprates .",
