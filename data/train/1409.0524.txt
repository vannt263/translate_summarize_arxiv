    "for example , if we ignore the contribution of the bound state to the dynamics in eq .  , we find that the scattering states dephase in such a way that the dynamical contact asymptotes towards @xmath69 without any oscillations , regardless of the initial scattering length .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the unregularized bogoliubov prediction .",
    "once the scattering states dephase , however , the bound state is left to dominate the short - range wavefunction except in the relatively trivial case where @xmath136 .",
    "the excess short - range correlations , given by the second bracketed term in eq .  , are determined entirely by the original projection of the initial condition onto the bound state .",
    "we can estimate the amplitude of the depletion oscillations by simply integrating over the relevant portion of the momentum distribution . from eq .   and",
    "the fact that @xmath137 at large @xmath138 , the part of the momentum distribution oscillating at the bound - state frequency behaves as @xmath139 aside from the time - independent contribution to the @xmath61 tail . as mentioned previously , these oscillations occur at the momentum scale of the bound state , where @xmath140 . integrating eq .  , we find that the oscillating part of the depletion fraction is approximately @xmath141 the oscillation amplitude given here agrees with the many - body data shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : depletion ] to within a factor of order unity , and we expect it to be a reasonable estimate as long as the diluteness parameter @xmath2 is small before and after the diabatic quench .    as a final aside , we note that our two - body analysis is able to generalize the short - time dynamics following a quench to unitarity .",
    "although we have presented the derivation of eq .   for the case of weak interactions ( @xmath142 , @xmath125 ) , we have found that its @xmath143 limit is well defined and correctly describes the short - time contact dynamics after diabatically quenching the two - body wavefunction from weakly interacting to unitarity : @xmath144 this limit represents a generalization of eq .   for diabatic quenches from small initial scattering length @xmath145 , and it agrees with the earlier result when @xmath146 is vanishingly small .",
    "we have elucidated the important role of the bound state in determining the contact dynamics of a diabatically - quenched bec .",
    "we first computed these dynamics using a variational many - body model , demonstrating that large - amplitude oscillations of the contact can be observed even with existing magnetic - field - ramp technology .",
    "our calculations reinforce the idea that coherent , short - range physics can lead to measureable signatures even in the bec fraction .",
    "this is the dominant physics of the quenched gas on short time scales , before many - body effects and loss become important .",
    "we also developed a calibration scheme for two - body models that leads to an unambiguous , quantitative description of bec contact dynamics following a sudden quench .",
    "our prescription fixes both the log - derivative and absolute magnitude of the initial short - range , two - body wavefunction by matching to the many - body problem , and we are able to derive analytic formulae for the short - time evolution of the contact in the weakly - interacting and unitarity limits .",
    "our computed dynamics are shown to be independent of the arbitrary features of the models , and they agree with many - body predictions .",
    "this two - body picture indicates that bound - state oscillations of the contact are analogous to interferometry .",
    "we expect that one can account for finite ramp speeds by numerically solving the two - body schrodinger equation for a properly - calibrated model @xcite .",
    "the dynamical contact can be measured using time - resolved rf spectroscopy , as done in ref .",
    "our analysis shows that even the time - averaged contact @xmath133 may be greatly magnified relative to the unregularized bogoliubov prediction due to bound - state physics , and this could be observed with an rf pulse that is long compared to the bound - state oscillation period .",
    "measuring the oscillations themselves necessarily requires using shorter pulses , and that may lead to inconvenient broadening of the central rf peak . in any event , the temporal constraints on time - resolved rf spectroscopy depend both on the atomic species and on the transition under consideration , and they are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we reiterate that the bound - state dynamics that we have considered are a coherent , transient effect .",
    "they encapsulate the response of a short - range wavefunction to an abrupt change in the scattering length or , equivalently , a log - derivative boundary condition . at longer time scales ,",
    "we expect the oscillations to damp out as the system equilibrates .",
    "similar damping was observed in the ramsey experiment of refs .",
    "@xcite , and it was believed to be due to a combination of incoherent three - body loss and dephasing from magnetic - field inhomogeneities . still , the coherence of large - momentum dynamics persisted for many oscillation periods before damping became significant .",
    "the engineering of quench apparatus has improved over the years , especially in creating ramps that are diabatic with respect to the bound state @xcite .",
    "this opens the door for systematic experimental studies of bound - state signatures in quenched becs .",
    "j.p.c and j.l.b recognize support from the ndseg fellowship program and the nsf , respectively .",
    "we acknowledge helpful conversations from a. g. sykes and k. r. a. hazzard .",
    "the time - dependent , two - body momentum distribution can be calculated analytically for each of the initial conditions listed in eq .  , and",
    "for arbitrary initial and final scattering lengths . except in certain limits ( discussed in the main text ) , these formulas are generally too lengthy to usefully write down .",
    "we include here the simplest example , which is the distribution for the bare exponential of eq .   after a quench from noninteracting ( @xmath109 ) to unitarity ( @xmath147 ) . after evaluating the integrals in eqs .  - , we find that @xmath148\\right . \\\\ & \\quad\\quad\\left .",

    "@xcite , besides depending on the harmonic nature of the trap , depends strongly on the assumption that the nearest - neighbor separation is given by the wigner - seitz radius @xmath153 . if one uses the more - accurate chandrasekhar estimate for this separation ( cf . ref .",
