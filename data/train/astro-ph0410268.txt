    "the increasing bulk of data that have been accumulated in the last few years have paved the way to the emergence of a new standard cosmological model usually referred to as the _ concordance model_. the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( hereafter sneia ) , measured by both the supernova cosmology project @xcite and the high - z team @xcite up to redshift @xmath0 , first indicated that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . on the other hand , balloon born experiments , such as boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite , determined the location of the first and second peak in the anisotropy spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) strongly indicating that the geometry of the universe is spatially flat . if combined with constraints coming from galaxy clusters on the matter density parameter @xmath1 , these data indicate that the universe is dominated by a non - clustered fluid with negative pressure generically dubbed _ dark energy _ which is able , eventually , both to close the universe and drive its accelerated expansion .",
    "this picture has been further strengthened by the more precise measurements of the cmbr spectrum , due to the wmap experiment @xcite , and by the extension of the sneia hubble diagram to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of this scenario , an overwhelming flood of papers , presenting a great variety of models which try to explain this phenomenon has appeared ; in any case , the simplest explanation is claiming for the well known cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite . although the best fit to most of the available astrophysical data @xcite , the @xmath3cdm model failed in explaining why the inferred value of @xmath3 is so tiny ( 120 orders of magnitude lower ) compared to the typical vacuum energy values predicted by particle physics and why its energy density is comparable to the matter density right now ( the so called _ coincidence problem _ ) .",
    "as a tentative solution , many authors have replaced the cosmological constant with a scalar field rolling down its potential and giving rise to the model now referred to as _ quintessence _",
    "even if successful in fitting the data , the quintessence approach to dark energy is still plagued by the coincidence problem since the dark energy and matter densities evolve differently and reach comparable values for a very limited portion of the universe evolution that is taken to coincide with the present era .",
    "moreover , it is not clear where this scalar field originates from thus leaving a great uncertainty on the choice of the scalar field potential ( see @xcite for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "the subtle and elusive nature of dark energy has led many authors to look for completely different scenarios able to give a quintessential behavior without the need of exotic components .    to this aim , it is worth stressing that the acceleration of the universe only claims for a negative pressure dominant component , but does not tell anything about the nature and the number of cosmic fluids filling the universe .",
    "this consideration suggests that it could be possible to explain the accelerated expansion by introducing a single cosmic fluid with an equation of state causing it to act like dark matter at high densities and dark energy at low densities .",
    "an attractive feature of these models , usually referred to as _ unified dark energy _",
    "( ude ) or _ unified dark matter _",
    "( udm ) models , is that such an approach naturally solves , al least phenomenologically , the coincidence problem .",
    "some interesting examples are the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , the tachyon field @xcite and the condensate cosmology @xcite",
    ".    a different class of ude models has been recently proposed by some of us @xcite where a single fluid is considered whose energy density scales with the redshift in such a way that the radiation dominated era , the matter domination era and the accelerating phase can be naturally achieved .",
    "it is worth noting that such a model is extremely versatile since it can be interpreted both in the framework of ude models and as a two - fluid scenario with dark matter and scalar field dark energy .",
    "actually , there is still a different way to face the problem of cosmic acceleration .",
    "as stressed in lue et al .",
    "@xcite , it is possible that the observed acceleration is not the manifestation of another ingredient in the cosmic pie , but rather the first signal of a breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravitation . from this point of view , it is thus tempting to modify the friedmann equations to see whether it is possible to fit the astrophysical data with a model comprising only the standard matter .",
    "interesting examples of this kind are the cardassian expansion @xcite and the dgp gravity @xcite .    moving in this same framework , it is possible to find alternative schemes where a quintessential behavior is obtained by simply taking into account the effective contribution to cosmology of some usually neglected fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , a cosmological constant term may be recovered as a consequence of a non - vanishing torsion field thus leading to a model which is consistent with both sneia hubble diagram and sunyaev - zeldovich data coming from clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "sneia data could also be efficiently fitted including higher - order curvature invariants in the gravity lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that these alternative schemes provide naturally a cosmological component with negative pressure whose origin is simply related to the geometry of the universe thus overcoming the problems linked to the physical significance of the scalar field .",
    "it is evident , from this short overview , the high number of cosmological models which are viable candidates to explain the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "this abundance of models is somehow a result of having only a limited number of cosmological tests to discriminate among rival theories so that any new observable which could be added to the usual ones is welcome . to this aim",
    ", it is useful to remember that both the sneia hubble diagram and the recently proposed angular size - redshift relation of compact radio sources @xcite are distance based methods to probe cosmological models . from this point of view , it is interesting to look for tests based on time - dependent observables . to this aim , one can take into account the _ lookback time _ to distant objects since this quantity can discriminate among different cosmological models .",
    "the lookback time is observationally estimated as the difference between the present day age of the universe and the age of a given object at redshift @xmath4 . such an estimate is possible if the object is a galaxy observed in more than one photometric band since its color is determined by its age as a consequence of stellar evolution .",
    "it is thus possible to get an estimate of the galaxy age by measuring its magnitude in different bands and then using stellar evolutionary codes to choose the model that reproduces the observed colors at best .",
    "a quite similar approach was pursued by lima & alcaniz @xcite who used the age ( rather than the lookback time ) of old high redshift galaxies to constrain the dark energy equation of state ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the same method was then applied also to braneworld models @xcite and the chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the estimate of the age of a single galaxy may be affected by systematic errors which are difficult to control .",
    "actually , this problem can be overcome by considering a sample of galaxies belonging to the same cluster . in this way , by averaging the estimates of all galaxies , one obtains an estimate of the cluster age and reduces the systematic errors .",
    "such a method was first proposed by dalal et al .",
    "@xcite and then used by ferreras et al .",
    "@xcite to test a class of models where a scalar field is coupled with the matter term giving rise to a particular quintessence scheme . we improve here this analysis using a different cluster sample and testing three different approaches to the dark energy problem .",
    "moreover , we add a further constraint to better test the dark energy models and assume that the age of the universe for each model is in agreement with recent estimates . note that this is not equivalent to the lookback time as we will discuss below .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in sect.ii ,",
    "we briefly present the three classes of cosmological models considered giving also the main quantities which we need for lookback time test .",
    "the method is developed in sect.iii and the used data are presented in sect.iv . a detailed discussion of the results is the subject of sect.v .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sect.vi .",
    "as overviewed in the introduction , many rival theories have been advocated to fit the observed accelerated expansion and to solve the puzzle of the nature of the dark energy .",
    "actually , we may divide the different cosmological models in three wide classes . according to the models of the first class ,",
    "the dark energy is new ingredient of the cosmic hubble flow , the simplest case being the @xmath3cdm scenario and its generalization which we will refer to as qcdm model .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the assumption of ude models ( the second class ) where there is a single fluid described by an equation of state comprehensive of all regimes of cosmic evolution such as the one proposed in @xcite which we will consider here referring to it as the _ parametric density model_. finally , according to the third class models , accelerated expansion is the first evidence of a breakdown of the einstein general relativity ( and thus of the friedmann equations ) which has to be considered as a particular case of a more general theory of gravity . as an example of this kind of models , we will consider the @xmath5-gravity @xcite . far from being exhaustive , considering",
    "these three models allow to explore very different scenarios proposed to explain the observed cosmic acceleration .    in the following we will sketch these three dark energy models and derive all the quantities we will need for the analysis developed in sect.iii .",
    "cosmological constant @xmath3 has now become a textbook candidate to drive the accelerated expansion of the spatially flat universe . despite its _ conceptual _ problems ,",
    "the @xmath3cdm model turns out to be the best fit to a combined analysis of completely different astrophysical data ranging from sneia to cmbr anisotropy spectrum and galaxy clustering @xcite . as a simple generalization",
    ", one may consider the qcdm scenario in which the barotropic factor @xmath6 takes a negative value with @xmath7 corresponding to the standard cosmological constant .",
    "how such a negative pressure fluid drives the cosmic acceleration may be easily understood by looking at the friedmann equations :    @xmath8    @xmath9    where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and we have assumed that the universe is spatially flat as suggested by the position of the first peak in the cmbr anisotropy spectrum @xcite . from the continuity equation , @xmath12 , we get for the @xmath13-th fluid with @xmath14 :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the redshift , @xmath17 is the density parameter for the @xmath13-th fluid in terms of the critical density @xmath18 and , hereafter , we label all the quantities evaluated today with a subscript @xmath19 . inserting this result into eq.([eq : fried1 ] ) , we get :    @xmath20    using eqs.([eq : fried1 ] ) , ( [ eq : fried2 ] ) and the definition of the deceleration parameter @xmath21 , one finds :    @xmath22    the sneia hubble diagram , the large scale galaxy clustering and the cmbr anisotropy spectrum can all be fitted by the @xmath3cdm model with @xmath23 thus giving @xmath24 , i.e. the universe turns out to be in an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "the simplicity of the model and its capability of fitting the most of the data are the reasons why the @xmath3cdm scenario is the leading candidate to explain the dark energy cosmology .",
    "nonetheless , we will first consider its generalization , the qcdm model , before concentrating on the @xmath3cdm scenario .      in the framework of ude models",
    ", it has been recently proposed @xcite a phenomenological class of models by introducing a single fluid with energy density :    @xmath25 \\label{eq : rhor}\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) two scaling factors and @xmath30 a normalization constant . for several applications , it is useful to rewrite the energy density as a function of the redshift @xmath4 .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . by setting @xmath41",
    "the energy density smoothly interpolates from a radiation dominated phase to a matter dominated period finally approaching a de sitter state .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath30 may be estimated by inserting eq.([eq : rhor ] ) into eq.([eq : fried1 ] ) and evaluating the result today .",
    "this gives :    @xmath42    the continuity equation may be recast in a form that allows us to compute the pressure for our fluid and then the barotropic factor @xmath43 obtaining @xcite :    @xmath44 b^{\\alpha } - [ 3 ( a + s ) + ( \\alpha - \\beta ) s ] a^{\\alpha}}{3 ( a + s ) ( a^{\\alpha } + b^{\\alpha } ) } \\label{eq : wr}\\ ] ]    which shows that the barotropic factor strongly depends on the scale factor ( and hence on the redshift ) . combining the friedmann equations , we get for the deceleration parameter @xmath45 which , in our case , gives :    @xmath46 b^{\\alpha } - [ 2 ( a + s ) + ( \\alpha - \\beta ) s ] a^{\\alpha } } { 2 ( a + s ) ( a^{\\alpha } + b^{\\alpha } ) } \\ ; \\label{eq : qr}\\ ] ]    inserting @xmath47 gives the present day value as :    @xmath48 + ( \\beta - 4 ) ( 1 + y)}{2 ( 2 + z_s ) ( 1 + y ) } \\label{eq : qz}\\ ] ]    with @xmath49 .",

    "the choice of the evolutionary model is a key step in the estimate of the color age and the main source of uncertainty @xcite .",
    "an alternative and more robust route to cluster age is to consider the color scatter ( see @xcite for an early application of this approach ) .",
    "the argument , qualitatively , goes in this way : if galaxies have an extreme similarity in their color and nothing is conspiring to make the color scatter surreptitiously small , then the latest episode of star formation should happened in the galaxy far past , otherwise the observed color scatter would be larger .",
    "quantitatively , the scatter in color should thus be equal to the derivative of color with time multiplied the scatter of star formation times .",

    "the main results are plotted in figs.[fig : tauqcdm ] and [ fig : clqcdm ] . in the first plot , we compare the estimated clusters age with the quantity :    @xmath132    using the best fit values for the model parameters and the delay factor which turn out to be :    @xmath133    giving @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath108 value for the best fit parameters ( both for the qcdm model and the other dark energy models considered ) turns out to be quite small suggesting that we have seriously overestimated the errors .",
    "this is not surprising given the ( somewhat arbitrary ) way we have fixed the uncertainties on the estimated age of the clusters . that this is likely to be the case",
    "is also suggested by a qualitative argument .",
    "one could rescale the errors on @xmath89 in such a way that @xmath135 for the best fit model .",
    "since for the best fit qcdm model , @xmath136 , this leads to multiply by almost @xmath137 the uncertainties on @xmath89 . if the error on @xmath81 were negligible",
    ", this means that we should reduce the uncertainty on the cluster age from 1 gyr to 0.2 gyr that is indeed a more realistic value .",
    "the presence of an error on @xmath138 slightly complicates this argument , but does not change the main conclusion .",
    "we are thus confident that the very low value of the @xmath108 we get for the best fit model is only due to overestimating the uncertainties on the clusters ages .",
    "however , we do not perform any rescaling of the uncertainties since , to this end , we should select a priori a model as the confidence one which is contrary to the philosophy of the paper .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that such rescaling does not affect anyway the main results .",
    "fig.[fig : clqcdm ] shows the @xmath111 and @xmath112 confidence levels in the @xmath139 plane obtained by marginalizing over the hubble constant and the delay factor .",
    "two interesting considerations may be drawn from that plot .",
    "first , we note that also _ phantom",
    "_ models ( i.e. models with @xmath140 violating the weak energy condition ) are allowed by the data .",
    "this is in agreement with recent results coming from fitting the qcdm model to the sneia hubble diagram and the cmbr anisotropy spectrum @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison is not possible since the marginalized likelihood is too flat to get any constraints on @xmath141 so that all the values in the range tested @xmath142 are well within the @xmath111 cl .",
    "although essentially due to the paucity of the data , this result is also a consequence of having not used any prior on @xmath1 as it is usually done in other analyses . by using the procedure described at the end of sect.iii , we obtain the following estimates for the other qcdm parameters :    @xmath143    @xmath144    given that we are able to give only weak constraints on the qcdm model , from now on we will only dedicate our attention to the case @xmath7 , i.e. to the @xmath3cdm model and do not discuss anymore the results for the qcdm model . the best fit parameters for the cosmological constant model turn out to be :    @xmath145    that gives rise to the curve @xmath146 shown in fig.[fig : taulcdm ] , while fig.[fig : cllcdm ] reports the confidence regions in the @xmath147 plane after marginalizing over the delay factor . from the marginalized likelihood functions , we get :    @xmath148    @xmath149",
    "the @xmath3cdm model has been widely tested against a large set of different astrophysical data .",
    "this offers us the possibility to cross check both the model and the validity of method .",
    "it is instructive , in this sense , to compare our results with those coming from the fit to the sneia hubble diagram .",
    "for instance , barris et al .",
    "@xcite used a set of 120 sneia up to @xmath150 finding @xmath151 as best fit value with a large uncertainty ( not quoted explicitly , but easy to see in their fig.12 ) in good agreement with our result .",
    "a more recent result has been obtained by riess et al .",
    "@xcite which have used a sneia hubble diagram extending up to @xmath152 and have found @xmath153 still in agreement with our result .",
    "the @xmath3cdm model has also been tested by means of the angular size - redshift relation . using a catalog of ultracompact radio sources and taking carefully into account systematic uncertainties and selection effects ,",
    "jackson @xcite has found @xmath154 in almost perfect agreement with our estimate .",
    "neither barris et al .",
    "@xcite nor riess et al .",
    "@xcite quote a best fit value for @xmath77 since this parameter is infinitely degenerate with the supernovae absolute magnitude @xmath155 when fitting to the sneia hubble diagram .",
    "nonetheless , sneia may still be used to determine @xmath77 by fitting the linear hubble law to the low redshidt ( @xmath156 ) sneia . using this method , daly &",
    "djorgovski @xcite have found @xmath157 in good agreement with our result .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that our estimate for @xmath77 turns out to be in agreement with estimates coming from different methods such as various local standard candles @xcite , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in galaxy clusters @xcite and time delays in multiply imaged quasars @xcite .",
    "finally , let us quote the results obtained by tegmark et al .",
    "@xcite which have performed a combined fit of the @xmath3cdm model to both the wmap data on the cmbr anisotropy spectrum and the galaxy power spectrum measured by more than 200,000 galaxies surveyed by the sdss collaboration .",
    "they find @xmath158 and @xmath159 in very good agreement with our results .",
    "perhaps , the most interesting result of testing the @xmath3cdm model with our method is not the success of this model ( since it has yet been shown by a lot of evidences ) , but the substantial agreement among our estimates of the parameters @xmath147 and those coming from different kinds of data .",
    "this is quite encouraging since it is an important successful cross check and makes us confident about the results one could obtain by applying it to other cosmological models .",
    "let us now examine the results obtained for the parametric density model , pictorially shown in figs.[fig : tauhobbit ] and [ fig : clhobbit ] .",
    "the best fit model is obtained for the following values of the parameters @xmath130 and of the delay factor :    @xmath160    marginalizing over @xmath93 , we get :    @xmath161    @xmath162    note that the @xmath163 on the @xmath50 parameter has been truncated at the upper end since it formally extends to values higher than the physically acceptable one .    in @xcite ,",
    "the parameters of this model have been constrained by using both the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation .",
    "in particular , fitting the model to the sneia hubble diagram gives @xmath164 , while the physically acceptable range for @xmath50 turns out to be in agreement with the data for @xmath165 as best fit value .",
    "the present day deceleration parameter @xmath50 is better constrained using the data listed in jackson @xcite to perform the angular size - redshift test thus obtaining @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "both these results are in very good agreement with our estimates so that we conclude that the parametric density model is a viable candidate alternative to the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "finally , let us discuss the results for the curvature quintessence .",
    "figs.[fig : clcurvup ] and [ fig : clcurvdown ] report the confidence regions in the plane @xmath131 for the curvup and curvdown regime respectively after marginalizing over the delay factor .",
    "the first striking feature is that the contour plots are not closed so that the marginalized likelihood function gives only an upper ( lower ) limit to the parameter @xmath72 in the curvup ( curvdown ) regime .",
    "formally , we get the following estimates for the best fit values in the curvup and curvdown regime respectively :    @xmath167    @xmath168    but the best fit value for @xmath72 actually lies outside the investigated range for this parameter . being the confidence regions open , it is meaningless to give constraints on @xmath77 , but nonetheless it is possible to infer the following limits :    @xmath169    @xmath170    where the first row refers to the curvup regime and the second to the curvdown one .",
    "these limits do not contradict the ranges determined by fitting to the sneia hubble diagram @xcite , but seems to be quite non - realistic .",
    "actually , the deceleration parameter corresponding to these values of @xmath72 is quite small @xmath171 thus contradicting the evidence in favor of an accelerating universe .",
    "moreover , the results in @xcite have been obtained by using an old sample of sneia , including some sneia that have now been discarded from the gold set in riess et al .",
    "on the other hand , it is worth noting that fitting a power law scale factor to the angular size - redshift relation for compact radio sources gives @xmath172 @xcite which , by using eq.([eq : alphancurv ] ) , translates in an estimate for @xmath72 that is in good agreement with our result .",
    "the impressive amount of data indicating a spatially flat universe in accelerated expansion has posed the problem of dark energy and stimulated the search for cosmological models able to explain such unexpected behavior .",
    "many rival theories have been proposed to solve the puzzle of the nature of dark energy ranging from a rolling scalar field to a unified picture where a single exotic fluid accounts for the whole dark sector ( dark matter and dark energy ) .",
    "moreover , modifications of the gravity lagrangian has also been advocated .",
    "although deeply different in their underlying physics , all these scenarios share the common feature of well reproducing the available astrophysical data .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that the most widely used cosmological tests and in particular the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redhisft relation ) are essentially based on distance measurements to high redshift objects and are thus affected by similar systematic errors .",
    "it is hence particularly interesting to look for methods which are related to the estimates of different quantities .",
    "being affected by other kinds of observational problems , such methods could be considered as cross checks for the results obtained by the usual tests and they should represent complementary probes for cosmological models .",
    "the technique we have devised here is a first step in this direction .",
    "we have used the present age of the universe and the lookback time to galaxy clusters to build a sort of _ time diagram _ of the universe in order to reconstruct its age evolution .",
    "relying on stellar evolutionary codes , the estimate of the lookback time is related to a different astrophysics than the distance based methods and it is thus free from any problem connected with the evolution of standard candles ( such as the sneia absolute magnitude and the intrinsic linear size of radio sources ) . actually , this technique could be affected by its own systematics ( such as , for instance , the degeneracy between age and metallicity ) , but these may be better controlled . moreover , comparing the results thus obtained with those coming from distance based methods allows to strengthen the conclusions suggested by both techniques .    motivated by these considerations ,",
    "we have first applied our method to the @xmath3cdm model in order to estimate the present day values of the matter density parameter @xmath1 and of the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath77 obtaining ( at the @xmath111 cl ) :      these values are in agreement with the previous estimates in literature .",
    "this can be considered an independent confirmation not only of the viability of the @xmath3cdm model , but also of our method .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath3cdm scenario receives further support from this test and henceforth the cosmological constant @xmath3 still remains the best candidate to explain the dark energy puzzle from an observational point of view .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath3cdm model is severely affected by conceptual problems so that it is worthwhile to look fo alternative approaches . this has stimulated a plenty of models where the cosmic acceleration is due to a dominant scalar field rolling down its potential .",
    "however , such a scheme , on the one hand , still does not solve the coincidence problem and , on the other hand , is plagued by the unidentified nature of the scalar field itself and the ignorance of its self interaction potential .",
    "these considerations have opened the way to different models that are able to give an accelerated expansion without the need of scalar fields .",
    "two of these approaches have been tested in this paper .    in @xcite , it has been proposed a phenomenological unified model where a single fluid with a given energy density assigned by few parameters is able to fit both the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation for ultracompact radio sources without the need of any cosmological constant or scalar field .",
    "this parametric density model has been tested here with lookback time method and the following estimates ( at the @xmath111 cl ) for its characterizing parameters has been obtained :      in agreement with the results from the test performed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that our method turns out to be more efficient than the usual fit to the sneia hubble diagram for the parametric density model .",
    "it is also interesting to note that both @xmath50 and @xmath81 predicted by this model are in almost perfect agreement with those computed for the @xmath3cdm model with the parameters @xmath147 as discussed above .",
    "this is not surprising since eq.([eq : rhor ] ) shows that , nowadays , the energy density of the parametric density model is very similar to that of the @xmath3cdm model so that these two scenarios share most of the observable properties referred to today quantities .",
    "however , this does by no way mean that the two models are the same . actually , it is the underlying philosophy that is completely different having now a single fluid rather than a cosmological constant dominating over the matter term .",
    "both models predict similar values ofthe today observed quantities simply because they are tied to reproduce the same data and not because they are two different manifestations of the same underlying physics .",
    "another possible approach to the cosmic acceleration is to consider this feature as the first signal of the breakdown of the einstein general relativity at some characteristic scale . in this picture ,",
    "the universe is still dominated by standard matter , but the friedmann equations have to be modified as consequence of a different gravity lagrangian .",
    "this philosophy inspired curvature quintessence scenarios where an effective dark energy is related to the properties of the function @xmath5 which replaces the ricci scalar @xmath58 in the gravity lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the coupling between matter and curvature for a theory with @xmath63 gives rise to fourth order nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of the scale factor that is not analytically solvable .",
    "this difficulty disappears if one considers a toy model with @xmath175 so that power law solutions , @xmath176 , are possible provided that @xmath177 is linked to @xmath72 by eq.([eq : alphancurv ] ) .",
    "such a model is particularly attractive from a theoretical viewpoint ( since it allows to give a purely geometric interpretation of the dark energy ) and has also been shown to fit well sneia hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that , while it is able to pass successfully the loockback time test implemented in this paper , only weak constraints can be imposed on the parameter @xmath72 with the best fit value lying in a region corresponding to decelerating rather than accelerating models .",
    "we are thus tempted to conclude that this scenario could be rejected with some confidence .",
    "actually , this conclusion is also suggested by the recent result by riess et al .",
    "@xcite which , using the sneia hubble diagram up to @xmath152 , have convincingly detected a change in the sign of the deceleration parameter @xmath178 .",
    "the power law solutions predict , on contrary , a constant @xmath178 so that they are ruled out by the result in riess et al .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that this is not a definitive exclusion of the curvature quintessence scenario . actually , we have only considered power law solutions in absence of matter .",
    "it is indeed conceivable that including a matter term completely change the evolution of the scale factor possibly giving a past deceleration followed by the present acceleration thus leading the curvature quintessence model in agreement with what is suggested by the extended sneia hubble diagram ( see also @xcite and references therein for a further discussion of curvature models ) .",
    "having tested three different models , it is worth asking what is the better one .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible on the basis of the test results only . comparing the @xmath108 values",
    ", one could naively conclude that the parametric density model is the best one since it gives the lowest @xmath108 .",
    "however , while the difference among the @xmath108 values is significant between the parametric density model and the curvature quintessence scenario ( almost an order of magnitude ) , it is too small ( 0.07 vs. 0.09 ) to conclude that the @xmath3cdm model is disfavored .",
    "we have thus to conclude that this test alone is not able to discriminate among these two dark energy candidates . on the other hand , sandvik et al .",
    "@xcite recently claimed that ude models are not viable because the growth of density perturbations will lead to matter power spectrum in disagreement with what is observed .",
    "this should be an evidence against the parametric density model .",
    "however , it is worth noting that sandvik et al",
    ". explicitely consider the generalized chaplygin gas model which is characterized by a negative squared sound speed that seems to be the main cause of the anomalous growth of perturbations . for the parametric density model , the sound speed is always positive definite so that it is likely that the argument of sandvik et al",
    ". should be at least reconsidered .",
    "finally , we would briefly comment on the possibility to ameliorate our method by increasing the maximum redshift probed . to this aim",
    ", galaxy clusters do not appear as good candidates since it is quite difficult to detect a significative number of member galaxies up to redshifts larger than @xmath179 .",
    "however , high redshift galaxies may be taken into account provided that they are detected in as more photometric bands as possible .",
    "this latter requirement is fundamental since it allows not only to better estimate the age of the galaxy , but also to infer constraints on its formation redshift @xmath83 that can not be assumed to be the same for all the galaxies ( as it has been possible for clusters ) .",
    "the @xmath13 drop out technique allows to discover galaxies up to redshift @xmath180 @xcite and thus let us hope to measure lookback time up to such high redshift . with its ability of both furnishing multicolor photometry of high redshift galaxies ( and thus better estimates of their color ages and formation redshift ) and increasing the number of sneia , the goods survey @xcite seems to be the most promising source of cosmological constraints in the near future .",
