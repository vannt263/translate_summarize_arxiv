    "the stbcs @xmath26 and @xmath91 are said to be _",
    "equivalent_. to simplify our analysis of unitary - weight codes , we make use of _ normalization _ as described below .",
    "let @xmath26 be a unitary - weight stbc and let its codeword matrix @xmath60 be expressed as @xmath100 consider the code @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , from lemma [ unitary_mult ] , @xmath102 is equivalent to @xmath26 .",
    "the weight matrices of @xmath103 are @xmath104 with this , a codeword matrix @xmath105 of @xmath102 can be written as @xmath106 we call the code @xmath103 to be the normalized code of @xmath26 . in general , any unitary - weight ssd code with one of its weight matrices being the identity matrix is called _ normalized _ unitary - weight ssd code .",
    "studying unitary - weight ssd codes becomes simpler by studying normalized unitary - weight ssd codes .",
    "also , an upper bound on the rate of unitary - weight ssd codes is the same as that of the normalized unitary - weight ssd codes . for the normalized unitary - weight ssd code transmitting @xmath43 symbols in @xmath0 channel uses , the conditions presented in and can be rewritten as @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "so , every weight matrix except @xmath111 and @xmath112 should square to @xmath113 .",

    "let @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 be @xmath122 unitary , pairwise anticommuting matrices .",
    "then , the product matrix @xmath123 , with the exception of @xmath124 , is traceless .",
    "it is well known that @xmath125 for any two matrices @xmath11 and @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath126 be two invertible , @xmath10 anticommuting matrices .",
    "so , @xmath127 @xmath128 similarly , it can be shown that @xmath129 . by applying lemma [ lemma_4 ]",
    ", it can be seen that any product matrix @xmath130 , anticommutes with some other product matrix from the set @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , from the result obtained in , we can say that every product matrix @xmath132 except @xmath124 is traceless .",
    "since @xmath112 is a scaled product of @xmath133 matrices among @xmath134 unitary , pairwise anticommuting matrices , @xmath112 is traceless .",
    "so , becomes @xmath135 from the above expression , it is clear that for maximal - rate , unitary - weight ssd codes to offer full transmit diversity , the difference set @xmath136 , where @xmath47 is the constellation employed , should not have any points that lie on lines that are at @xmath137 degrees in the complex plane from the origin .",
    "further , since the analysis leading up to the expression in is not specific to any particular unitary - weight ssd code , we can infer that for any particular constellation @xmath47 , all maximal - rate , unitary - weight ssd codes have the same coding gain .      in this subsection",
    "we show that all maximal - rate , unitary - weight ssd codes have the same coding gain as the ciods @xcite for qam constellations .",
    "let @xmath138 , @xmath139 be the information symbols that take values from a constellation @xmath140 . consider the following unitary rotation .",
    "@xmath141 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c } y_{ii}\\\\ y_{iq } \\end{array}\\right ] , \\forall i = 1,2,\\cdots,2a.\\ ] ] the above operation is equivalent to rotating @xmath138 by @xmath142 radians to obtain @xmath143 .",
    "then , from , we have @xmath144 the above expression is the same as the one for ciod , obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that holds even when the angle of rotation is @xmath145 radians . in order to maximize @xmath146 , the minimum of the product @xmath147 , called the _ product distance _",
    ", must be maximized .",
    "this has been done for qam in @xcite , by rotating qam constellations by an angle of @xmath148 .",
    "so , @xmath138 , @xmath149 , should take values from a rotated qam constellation , with the angle of rotation being @xmath148 .",
    "so , the original information symbols @xmath143 , @xmath149 should take values from a rotated qam constellation , the angle of rotation being @xmath150 .",
    "since the coding gain for ciod has been maximized in @xcite by using a @xmath148 radian rotated qam constellation , the coding gain for all unitary - weight ssd codes when the symbols take values from a @xmath150 radian rotated qam constellation is also maximized .",
    "table [ table1 ] gives a comparison of the minimum determinants for the ciod , mdcqod and the unitary - weight ssd code presented in , all the codes designed for 4 transmit antennas . in the calculations , all the codes have the same average energy but the constellation energy has been allowed to increase with the increase in constellation size . as analytically shown , the minimum determinants are the same for all the three codes .      in this subsection , we provide some simulation results for 4 transmit antennas .",
    "all simulations are done assuming a quasi - static rayleigh fading channel .",
    "the number of receive antennas is 1 .",
    "[ plot ] shows the codeword error rate ( cer ) performances of the ciod for 4 transmit antennas , the mdcqod for 4 transmit antennas @xcite , and the new design whose codeword matrix is as in , at 2 bits and 3 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) . for transmission at 2 bpcu ,",
    "the constellation employed is the @xmath151 radian rotated 4-qam for the ciod and the @xmath152 radian rotated 4-qam for the mdcqod and the new design . for transmission at 3 bpcu , the constellations employed are the rotated rectangular 8-qam and the rotated square - derived 8-qam , the angle of rotation being the same as in the case of 4-qam .",
    "a squared - derived 8-qam constellation is obtained by removing the signal point with the highest energy from a 9-qam . specifically , it is the set @xmath153 .",
    "the simulation results support the fact that for qam constellations , the coding gain of the ssd codes is the same as that of the ciod .",
    "in this paper , we have provided an achievable upper bound on the rate of unitary - weight ssd codes for @xmath4 transmit antennas .",
    "the upper bound has been shown to be @xmath3 complex symbols per channel use .",
    "we also have completely characterized the structure of the weight matrices of the codes meeting the upper bound .",
    "we have further shown that all unitary - weight ssd codes that meet the upper bound have the same coding gain as that of the ciods and we have also identified the angle of rotation for qam constellations that allow the codes to have optimum coding gain .",
    "the analysis done in this paper throws open the following questions .    1 .",
    "what is the upper bound on the rate of square , non - unitary - weight ssd codes ?",
    "further , what are the conditions on the signal constellation that allow non - unitary - weight ssd codes to achieve full - diversity and optimum coding gain ?",
    "2 .   what is the upper bound on the rate of rectangular ssd codes , the class of which the rectangular mdcqods presented in @xcite and @xcite are a subclass ?    further , the analysis in this paper can be used to study the rates of multi - symbol decodable codes , the upper bounds of which has never been reported in literature .",
