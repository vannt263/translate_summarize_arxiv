    "the particle distribution is evolved using the high performance parallel treecode pkdgrav , using periodic boundaries and a variable timestep scheme based upon the local acceleration ( quinn _ et al _ 1997 , wadsley , quinn & stadel 2000 , in preparation ) . to maintain accurate forces when the mass distribution is fairly regular , from a redshift z=69 to z=2 we use an opening angle of @xmath41 and we complete the simulation using an opening angle of 0.7 .",

    "<S> can dissipationless n - body simulations be used to reliably determine the structural and substructure properties of dark matter halos ? a large simulation of a galaxy cluster in a cold dark matter universe </S>",
    "<S> is used to increase the force and mass resolution of current `` high resolution simulations '' by almost an order of magnitude to examine the convergence of the important physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster contains @xmath0 million particles within the final virial radius , @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) , and is simulated using a force resolution of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 of @xmath5 ) ; the final virial mass is @xmath6 , equivalent to a circular velocity @xmath7 at the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> the central density profile has a logarithmic slope of -1.5 , identical to lower resolution studies of the same halo , indicating that the profiles measured from simulations of this resolution have converged to the `` physical '' limit down to scales of a few kpc ( @xmath8 of @xmath5 ) . also the abundance and properties of substructure are consistent with those derived from lower resolution runs ; from small to large galaxy scales ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , the circular velocity function and the mass function of substructures can be approximated by power laws with slopes @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . at the current resolution , </S>",
    "<S> overmerging  a numerical effect that leads to structureless virialized halos in low - resolution @xmath13-body simulations  seems to be globally unimportant for substructure halos with circular velocities @xmath14 ( @xmath15% of the cluster s @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can identify subhalos orbiting in the very central region of the cluster ( @xmath17 ) and we can trace most of the cluster progenitors from high redshift to the present . </S>",
    "<S> the object at the cluster center ( the dark matter analog of a cd galaxy ) is assembled between @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the merging of a dozen halos with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> tidal stripping and halo - halo collisions decrease the mean circular velocity of the substructure halos by @xmath21 over a 5 billion year period . </S>",
    "<S> we use the sample of 2000 substructure halos to explore the possibility of biases using galactic tracers in clusters : the velocity dispersions of the halos globally agree with the dark matter within @xmath22 , but the halos are spatially anti - biased , and in the very central region of the cluster ( @xmath23 ) , they show positive velocity bias ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) ; however , this effect appears to depend on numerical resolution . </S>"
