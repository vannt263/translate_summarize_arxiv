    "some of the earliest studies to lay the foundation of galaxy formation have relied on analytical methods to follow the collisionless evolution of dark matter ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lead to pure power - law density distributions .",
    "several other studies have built on this early analytical framework . @xcite and @xcite have found similarity solutions for the spherical collapse of cosmological perturbations that produce nearly pure power - law density profiles .",
    "the halos in these studies are populated solely by radial orbits . @xcite",
    "have introduced nonradial motion , but the resulting density profiles are still well - approximated by a single power - law over at least two orders of magnitude in radius , with noticeable deviations only on small [ @xmath0 and large [ @xmath1 scales ( @xmath2 is the virial radius ) .",
    "as computing power has increased , another approach has been adopted to investigate cosmological structure formation , n - body simulations .",
    "these studies do not suffer from the same limitations of adopted approximations that are inherent in the analytically - based work , however such simulations do rely on other approximations , like gravitational softening .",
    "given appropriate initial conditions , cosmological n - body simulations ( cns ) can follow structure formation through non - linear development and investigate the impact of hierarchical merging ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",

    "these studies agree that the equilibrium dark matter halos that form in cns have nearly universal density profiles that are nothing like single power - laws .",
    "these halos generically have logarithmic slopes @xmath3 that become larger with increasing radius ; @xmath4 at one - hundredth of a virial radius and @xmath5 near the virial radius .",
    "there remain , however , disagreements regarding the exact values and behavior of @xmath6 , especially at small radii .    the fitting function that has been widely used to characterize the density profiles of cns halos , the nfw profile @xcite , has an explicit scalelength that divides the inner and outer behaviors . the nfw profile @xmath6 asymptotes to 1 as @xmath7 and 3 as @xmath8 .",
    "recently , @xcite have discussed another fitting function to describe the density profiles of higher resolution cns halos .",
    "unlike the nfw profile , @xmath6 of the new function does not approach asymptotic values at small and large radii and does not have the same well - defined scalelength as the nfw profile .",
    "instead , @xmath6 of this new profile changes continuously with radius , implying that there are no regions in which the density profile behaves like a power - law . at the same time , another recent study @xcite finds that the @xmath7 asymptotic power - law behavior persists in their high resolution cns .",
    "given this disagreement , it is unclear whether or not cns halos actually have preferred scalelengths .",
    "however , the nfw profile does provide a reasonable description of density distributions for galaxy and cluster scale cns halos @xcite .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we will refer to the radius at which @xmath9 as the scalelength .    despite these fairly minor disagreements regarding the behavior of @xmath6 ,",
    "cns halos ( as a class ) appear qualitatively similar .",
    "this similarity does not extend to the analytically - based ( ab ) halos described above .",
    "like previous studies that have sought to understand the differences between cns and ab halos ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are investigating how the input physics differs between the methods and whether or not such physics can explain the differences .",
    "we find evidence that a phenomenon related to the radial orbit instability ( roi ) can account for the differences as well as shed some light on the universality and scalelengths of cns halos .",
    "a brief introduction to the roi is given in ",
    "[ roisec ] .",
    "we lay out the hypothesis , drawing links between the roi , cns halos , and ab halos , in  [ hyp ] .",
    "the demonstration of the hypothesis relies on evolving dark matter halos semi - analytically and is based on the method presented in @xcite .",
    "our modifications to this method have been fully discussed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this method relies on spherical symmetry and ignores complications due to merging .",
    "this simplicity provides us with a degree of control not present in cns . at the same time , inclusion of secondary perturbations allows us to approximate the correct evolution of an isolated dark matter halo .",
    "details of the method and results of testing the hypothesis are presented in ",
    "we discuss the link between the roi and the shapes of cns halo density profiles in ",
    "the final section summarizes and presents the conclusions drawn from this work .",
    "early analytical and n - body studies have found that equilibrium spherical systems composed of purely radial orbits are unstable to forming bars or triaxial systems @xcite .",
    "although there is no general theory explaining the roi , @xcite argue that if a spherical system develops a small @xmath10 distortion , precession of radial orbits can draw them to reinforce the distortion , thereby increasing the distortion and leading to bar formation .",
    "whatever the exact mechanism is , it is clear that nonradial forces play a key role , as we will discuss in the next section .    @xcite",
    "have further investigated the roi by creating equilibrium systems with initial anisotropy ( @xmath11 ) profiles described by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is referred to as the anisotropy radius @xcite .",
    "these profiles are completely isotropic ( @xmath14 ) for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the initial half - mass radius . for smaller @xmath17 values ,",
    "the anisotropy increases from the center outwards . at the limit @xmath18 , the entire model is composed of radial orbits .",
    "@xcite list several fundamental results of the roi .",
    "first , an initially spherical system that undergoes the roi transforms into a nearly prolate bar with long - to - short axis ratio @xmath19 .",
    "second , for the anisotropy profile of equation  [ anisoeq ] there appears to be a fairly distinct border between systems that form a significant bar ( @xmath20 ) and those that remain relatively spherical ( @xmath21 ) ; however , other anisotropy profiles produce different stability criteria .",
    "third , the global anisotropy measure @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the kinetic energies associated with radial and tangential motions , respectively ) is not a universal arbiter of whether or not a system is unstable ; larger values of this ratio indicate instability , but there does not appear to be a definitive demarcation value @xcite .",
    "the @xcite work also highlights that the stability of any equilibrium system depends ( at a minimum ) on the anisotropy distribution , with centrally isotropic systems being more stable than those with radially anisotropic cores . in brief",
    ", collisionless systems will undergo the roi if a sufficient fraction of orbits are predominantly radial .",
    "while we have so far discussed the roi in equilibrium systems , collisionless collapses also appear to relate to the roi .",
    "the link with the roi is that these cold collapses produce mostly radial motion , a condition favorable to the onset of the roi .",
    "we compare the results of noncosmological and cosmological collapses and discuss the signature of the roi in the next section .",
    "studies of cold collisionless collapses in noncosmological settings @xcite report that the end results of collapses are good descriptions of observed surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies . for example , the collapses presented in @xcite result in mildly nonspherical systems with two - dimensional projected density profiles that are well - approximated by the srsic function @xmath25 $ ] @xcite , with @xmath26 like a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "these collapse products also display characteristic anisotropy profiles ; the inner regions are isotropic and transitions to radial anisotropy occur at larger radii .",
    "@xcite also point out that such collapses are less centrally concentrated than purely radial collapses .",
    "we extend and focus these thoughts by specifically investigating the link between density scalelengths and monotonic variations in velocity anisotropy .",
    "while some choices of initial conditions in the previously mentioned studies have an eye towards describing cosmological situations , their main goals relate to understanding elliptical galaxies .",
    "two studies directly deal with the differences between cosmological and noncosmological collapses .",
    "@xcite argues that the roi does not occur in cosmological settings because there is no correlation between final shape and initial @xmath27 value .",
    "however , this study also reports that the final states of collapses have density profiles that are well - approximated by a jaffe distribution @xcite , which is similar to a de vaucouleurs ( srsic @xmath28 ) profile when projected to two dimensions .",
    "more importantly , it is stated that the equilibria are supported by anisotropic velocity dispersions , like the results of the noncosmological studies .",
    "@xcite find that realistic cosmological collapses do not succumb to the bar instability , but , like @xcite , the final density profiles are approximated by a jaffe distribution ( again , similar to an @xmath28 srsic profile ) .",
    "unfortunately , this study focuses solely on the final shapes of the collapses and does not present any kinematic information to allow a comparison of anisotropy profiles . beyond these two studies , it is well - reported that halos formed in cns tend to appear similar to the products of noncosmological collapse simulations ; _ i.e. , _",
    "they appear prolate spheroidal / triaxial ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have monotonically increasing anisotropy distributions @xcite .",
    "all of these points lead us to conclude that cosmological collapse simulations result in systems that have the same qualitative density and anisotropy profiles as those from noncosmological studies .",
    "the final states of these collapses are similar , but have the systems undergone the roi ? from the literature , it appears that most researchers consider bar formation to be the signpost of the instability .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite studies suggest that the roi is absent in cosmological situations due to the lack of bars .",
    "@xcite refer to the merely slightly nonspherical results in @xcite as stable .",
    "we propose that bar formation may not be the only sign of the roi , but possibly only the most flagrant .",
    "the end results of collapses like those in @xcite , where no strong bar is formed , display a less drastic result of the roi .",
    "the equilibrium states resulting from collisionless collapses have similar anisotropy profiles ; anisotropy increases ( becomes more radial ) with radius .",
    "this is in line with the discussion in @xcite which regards systems with isotropic central regions as more stable than those with radially anisotropic central regions . from this point of view",
    ", the roi changes the mostly radial initial velocity distribution into one that has an isotropic core surrounded by a radial `` mantle '' . as we continue this discussion",
    ", we will use the term `` mroi '' ( mild aspect of the roi ) to include the onset of the anisotropy profile and possible mild triaxiality and to distinguish it from the usual ( and more extreme ) bar - formation criterion .",
    "figure  [ bplot ] shows anisotropy profiles that can be constructed from information in several previous studies .",
    "panel a ) shows the results of @xcite ( plus symbols ) and the analytical expression utilized by @xcite , equation  [ anisoeq ] . in the figure ,",
    "we have set @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the effective radius of the corresponding de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "note that the analytical expression is not a fit to the data points , it merely illustrates the initial anisotropy profile utilized in the roi study of @xcite .",
    "panel b ) shows the results from the `` @xmath31 '' ( here , @xmath32 refers to the power spectrum @xmath33 , not the srsic profile ) simulation of @xcite ( asterisks ) as well as the analytical expression adopted by @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the virial radius and we have chosen @xmath36 .",
    "this expression is intended to fit the data points from equilibrium systems .",
    "the last panel shows the results of the simulations of @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the amplitude of the anisotropy in the @xcite result ( panel b ) is much smaller than the other cases , but the monotonically increasing nature is still present .",
    "the mroi anisotropy profile is found generically in collapses .",
    "we find support for a link between the mroi and the presence of scalelengths in cns halos looking closely at the information from @xcite .",
    "this work has investigated 5 models of isolated dark matter halo formation .",
    "four of these have simple initial conditions that were chosen to highlight the impact of differing amounts of initial random motion .",
    "the fifth represents a standard nfw type halo .",
    "their model i is especially interesting since it has no initial tangential motions and tangential forces are not allowed , essentially forcing radial collapse .",
    "the resulting halo is described by a constant radial anisotropy ( @xmath37 , diamonds in figure  [ bplot]c ) and a single power - law density profile @xmath38 .",
    "once this restriction on tangential motion is lifted ( models ii - iv have increasing amounts of initial random motion and allow nonradial forces ) , the resulting anisotropy profiles show basically isotropic cores with @xmath39 increasing with radius ( figure  [ bplot]c ) , evidence that the mroi is present in these cases .",
    "the corresponding density profiles resemble nfw profiles , _",
    "i.e.,_a scalelength is introduced .",
    "while generic equilibria do not have a unique relation between @xmath39 and @xmath6 , @xcite point out that a wide variety of cns halos appear to have a specific link between the anisotropy distribution and @xmath6 . in ",
    "[ link ] , we further discuss this connection and the specific forms of the density and anisotropy profiles .",
    "these previous studies provide evidence of two things .",
    "one , the mroi , and its consequent anisotropy profile that has a distinct scalelength dividing an isotropic core from a radial mantle , is ubiquitous in collapses .",
    "two , this scalelength is linked to ( if not the same as ) the scalelength of the resulting density distributions .",
    "these points are the basis of the hypothesis that the mroi a ) is the key physics missing from previous ab studies of dark matter halo formation and b ) leads to density profiles with scalelengths",
    ". we will now proceed to describe and discuss our testing of this hypothesis .",
    "we are not interested in modeling the mroi .",
    "what we want to do is mimic the key result of the instability , the anisotropy profile , by suitable alterations of inputs .",
    "this approach will let us test the root of the hypothesis , the impact of the anisotropy distribution on the resulting density distribution .    to create the halos we will investigate , we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "initially thin spherical shells expand with the hubble flow until they reach their turn - around radius , at which time they collapse onto the mass interior . at the moment",
    "a shell begins to collapse , the integrated effects of secondary perturbations are introduced : a shell , which can be thought of as a mass of particles , is given a velocity dispersion .",
    "this can also be pictured as giving the shell a thickness , with apo- and pericentric distances . at the same time , the perturbation velocity is oriented randomly , introducing angular momentum for that shell .",
    "the perturbation velocities calculated per @xcite are actually rms values .",
    "therefore , we follow @xcite and randomly choose the magnitude of the velocity from the maxwell speed distribution ( truncated at 4 standard deviations ) with the rms value from @xcite . since our method relies on choosing random magnitudes and directions , for the rest of this paper we will average over some number ( usually 20 ) of halos and refer to the average quantities as belonging to a single halo .",
    "the benefit of the @xcite formalism is that it allows us to impose an arbitrary velocity dispersion profile and then study the halos that result from the subsequent collapse .",
    "however , before we explore variations in the anisotropy profile , we first establish a `` standard '' halo to use as a benchmark . by construction",
    ", it will be similar to the halos that have been created in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spatial density and phase - space density proxy @xmath40 profiles of the standard halo are shown in figure  [ stdden ] ( as usual , @xmath41 is the radius at which the halo density is 200@xmath42 ) .",
    "the top panel highlights the deviations from @xmath43 . over a substantial radial range ( @xmath44 ) ,",
    "the density is well described by a single power - law @xmath45 .",
    "this agrees well with the halo described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 11 ) .",
    "we show the @xmath40 distribution for the standard halo in the bottom panel .",
    "this distribution is nicely approximated by a power - law with exponent @xmath46 over a wide radial range @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we also present the velocity distributions in figure  [ stdsig ] .",
    "the radial , one - dimensional tangential , and total velocity dispersion profiles along with the anisotropy distribution are shown .",
    "note that the velocities are basically isotropic over the entire range ( the upturn outside @xmath41 is from infalling material ) .",
    "not surprisingly , given its scale - free power - law properties , we find that the standard halo is a poor match to those from cosmological n - body simulations , represented in figure  [ stdden ] by a nfw profile of concentration 10 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to altering the parameters of the standard halo by varying the velocities caused by secondary perturbations .",
    "we introduce a factor @xmath48 , which is a function of initial comoving radius @xmath49 , to effect the desired changes .",
    "since we are interested in mimicking the end result of the mroi , we introduce changes that produce an anisotropy profile that is isotropic near the center and becomes radially anisotropic with increasing radius .",
    "the prescription for doing this in @xcite is a simple one ; halve the perturbation velocities in a specified comoving radial range @xmath50 giving an inverted top - hat @xmath48 distribution , @xmath51 in this prescription , the perturbation velocities are simply multiplied by @xmath48 .",
    "the impact of this prescription is to decrease the angular momentum imparted by perturbations in the specified radial range .",
    "this prescription also alters the total perturbation velocity , thereby changing the energy imparted to the halo by the perturbations .",
    "the end result is a halo that loses the power - law properties of the standard halo and instead resembles an nfw profile ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "a representative @xmath52 distribution used in this study is shown in figure  [ fdist ] .",
    "the distance measure of the @xmath49-axis is the initial comoving radius of a shell in mpc .",
    "the algebraic expression is , @xmath53 e^{-(x - x_h)^n/2\\omega^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath54 control the shape and width of the trough , @xmath55 is the depth of the trough , @xmath56 is the mid - point of the trough , @xmath57)+\\nu_{\\infty},\\ ] ] @xmath58 controls the slope of @xmath59 at @xmath56 , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the asymptotic values .",
    "these parameters give us considerable flexibility to explore the impact of secondary perturbations on the final halos .",
    "after some experimentation , we have found that the interesting parameters to vary are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath56 .",
    "we fix the remaining parameters ; @xmath28 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in general ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "if we simply multiply the perturbation velocities by @xmath48 , then near the center ( @xmath67 ) we introduce more angular momentum than in the standard halo .",
    "conversely , @xmath68 saps angular momentum relative to the standard case . through various trials ,",
    "this change from @xmath67 to @xmath68 appears essential to reproducing the mroi anisotropy profile , and we point out that @xmath48 is simply a means of achieving this end .",
    "we have not determined the exact link between the behavior of @xmath48 , which is imposed only at a shell s initial turn - around point , and the physical process of the mroi .",
    "it is possible that the rms perturbations calculated according to @xcite are larger than those in cns because of the one - dimensional nature of this method .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath68 is simply reducing the effects of exaggerated secondary perturbations .",
    "while further work may elucidate the relationship between @xmath48 and the physics of the mroi , for the purposes of this study , it suffices that this @xmath48 distribution gives rise to an mroi - type anisotropy profile .",
    "as it seems unlikely that the mroi changes the energies of particles , we turn to a new prescription that leaves shell energies unchanged and instead affects the orientations of the perturbation velocities .",
    "the prescription presented here ( and shown in figure  [ fdist ] ) uses the following @xmath48 distribution parameters ; @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 mpc .",
    "the magnitude of the perturbation velocity remains unchanged from its value derived from the maxwell speed distribution , but @xmath67 increases the probability that the velocity is oriented tangentially and vice versa .",
    "we reiterate that this prescription is intended solely to produce an mroi - type anisotropy profile .",
    "there is no direct link between @xmath48 and the physics of the mroi , and so the correspondence between the final profiles is bound to be inexact .",
    "figure  [ try81den ] illustrates the resulting spatial density and @xmath40 profiles .",
    "we can see that adopting this new prescription has indeed provided a scalelength for the halo . while we have not set out to exactly recreate nfw halos ,",
    "the similarity is clear .",
    "some of the differences between the average and nfw profiles is due to the fact that many individual halos are good approximations to nfw profiles with different concentrations ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "averaging these together tends to smear the peaks into a broader profile .",
    "looking at the distribution in panel ( b ) , we see a profile that is a decent approximation to a power - law over a couple orders of magnitude",
    ". it also appears to be a bit shallower ( slope @xmath73 ) than the standard halo s @xmath40 profile and more in line with the results of @xcite who find a slope of @xmath74 for three cns halos .",
    "figure  [ try81sig ] contains the same velocity information as figure  [ stdsig ] .",
    "the break in the power - law that is present in the density has an analogous presence in the velocity distributions .",
    "also , the anisotropy profile is familiar from the preceding discussion of the mroi ; _ i.e.,_the velocities are isotropic near the center with a fairly sharp transition to anisotropy .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the discussion of collapses in @xcite ; the roi reduces the central density relative to purely radial collapses .    to this point ,",
    "the discussion and figures presented in this section are all based on a single set of parameters that determine the @xmath48 distribution .",
    "we have done some parameter space exploration and have found that the @xmath60 parameter can have an important impact on the final profiles .",
    "this is not very surprising , since it primarily determines the impact of the isotropic core . as @xmath60 is reduced from 1.6 to 1 , the inner @xmath6 of the density profile changes from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "also , while we are not trying to exactly reproduce nfw halos , we have noted that by eliminating the introduction of random perturbation velocity magnitudes ( _ i.e. , _  just using the rms values ) we can make the agreement between our halos ( not shown ) and nfw halos better .",
    "we speculate that this occurs because it provides `` colder '' initial conditions ( in the sense discussed regarding the roi ) .",
    "we also find that the anisotropy profile is hardly affected if @xmath61 is varied between 1.0 and @xmath55 ( the effect of changing @xmath61 is to lower the @xmath48 value from 1.0 to @xmath63 over the range @xmath77 , see figure  [ fdist ] ) .",
    "a more thorough investigation has been made regarding the importance of @xmath56 , the mid - point of the @xmath48 trough . this parameter directly impacts the extent of the isotropic core present in the final anisotropy profile . in figure",
    "[ suitec ] , we show density profiles ( left column ) and the corresponding anisotropy profiles for 7 values of @xmath56 surrounding the canonical value ; from top to bottom @xmath56=\\{0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2}. we note that all the density profiles have scalelengths , but the agreement with the nfw form is within the error bars only for @xmath78 .",
    "more importantly , these models highlight the correspondence between the density scalelength @xmath79 and the anisotropy scalelength @xmath80 , defined here to be the radius at which @xmath81 , as in equation  [ anisoeq ] .",
    "figure  [ suitep ] displays this correlation ( solid line ) and also shows how @xmath82 , the largest radius at which @xmath14 , changes with @xmath79 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the density and anisotropy scalelengths are roughly the same ( within @xmath83 20% ) in these halos , further supporting the hypothesis that mroi induced anisotropy profiles lead to scalelengths in density profiles .",
    "in this section , we take up a discussion of the `` true '' shape of n - body halos .",
    "the preceding discussion has purposely ignored the differences between the `` canonical '' nfw profile and other cns halo fitting functions ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one must realize that our lack of detailed understanding of the physics of halo formation has forced us to approach halo structure from a very reactive posture ; halos are formed and then functions are chosen that resemble the resulting density profiles .",
    "unfortunately , these functions are somewhat arbitrary and do not , by themselves , lead to a deeper understanding of halo dynamics .",
    "the central idea of this study , that the mroi leads to an anisotropy distribution that is linked to the density distribution , can potentially provide a way around this arbitrariness .",
    "a full understanding of this physical mechanism can provide us with an expected density profile for collapse equilibria .",
    "in reality , the roi is not fully understood and so no _ ab initio _ prediction can be made . at present , we are left to continue the passive role of finding the function(s ) that best explain the simulation results and we now discuss the density profile specifically .    the density profile that has long been found associated with both noncosmological ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cosmological ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) n - body simulations is the de vaucouleurs ( srsic @xmath28 ) profile .",
    "however , srsic profiles are not very similar to the nfw profile , the dominant density fitting function over the past decade .",
    "while nfw profiles do fit cns halo density profiles well , recent work by @xcite suggests that the asymptotic behavior of the nfw profile as @xmath84 and @xmath85 does not fit density profiles as well as a function similar to the srsic form ( however , for a dissenting view see * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , @xcite and @xcite have presented evidence that the srsic form is closer to the true shapes of halo density profiles .",
    "as the density profiles of the various roi studies listed in this paper also find srsic ( specifically de vaucouleurs ) profiles , the n - body findings mesh nicely with the hypothesis that the roi is a key part of forming collapse equilibria .    taking the link between the mroi and equilibrium density distribution",
    "as established , we now speculate about the causal relationship between them . @xcite point out that there are a wide variety of equilibria available to halos with density profiles like those from cns .",
    "this variety arises from different velocity distributions , but we have shown that cns halos display mroi - type anisotropy profiles exclusively ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we propose that this choice between the equilibria is dynamically set by the mroi , which brings about the anisotropy distribution that is associated with a srsic density profile . as mentioned before",
    ", we can not currently demonstrate this association analytically , but @xcite , following the work of @xcite and @xcite , discuss how the srsic density profile goes hand - in - hand with the isotropic core and radially anisotropic mantle associated with the mroi .",
    "they present a distribution function meant to describe systems that have experienced incomplete violent relaxation .",
    "when this distribution function is integrated over velocity space , the density profile is very similar to the srsic form . integrating this function over spatial coordinates ,",
    "one derives an anisotropy profile that has the characteristic mroi shape . in the context of this idea ,",
    "the link between anisotropy and density profiles is present regardless of initial conditions ( _ i.e.,_cosmological or noncosmological ) , but we speculate that such different initial conditions most likely lead to differing srsic @xmath32 values . returning to the `` true '' shape of n - body halos , we conclude that srsic , rather than nfw , profiles are better descriptions of the density profiles of cns halos and that a fuller understanding of the roi will provide insight to the actual density profiles .",
    "there is an important difference between models of collisionless dark matter halos created from analytically - based methods and those resulting from cosmological n - body simulations . unless the input physics @xcite or parameters are varied ( as in  [ test ] ) ,",
    "the halos that result from analytical calculations tend to be best described by a single power - law density profile and approximately constant isotropic velocity dispersion anisotropy profiles .",
    "cosmological n - body simulation halos tend to have density distributions that steepen and anisotropy profiles that become more radial with increasing radius .",
    "we have explored the hypothesis , akin to the discussion in @xcite , that the presence of scalelengths in cosmological n - body simulations can be attributed to a mild aspect of the radial orbit instability , which produces equilibrium halos with isotropic cores surrounded by regions of radial anisotropy .",
    "the hypothesis is that it is this fundamental change in the character of the orbits supporting the halo that leads to scalelengths .",
    "cosmological n - body simulation halos incorporate the physics of the mild aspect of the radial orbit instability and present such scalelengths .",
    "analytically - based halos do not have this instability `` built - in '' and therefore lack the consequent scalelengths .    utilizing an extension of the analytically - based method of @xcite , we have investigated whether or not a preferred scalelength can be introduced into a halo that would naturally have a single power - law density distribution . to mimic the impact of the mild aspect of the radial orbit instability , we have artificially altered the velocities introduced by secondary perturbations to be more tangential near the center and more radial in the outer parts of a halo .",
    "this is an approximate way to include the effect of the instability in a technique that does not explicitly include such physics . in our prescription , the magnitudes of the perturbation velocities are left unchanged , only the directions are altered .",
    "this leaves the energy budget of the halo unchanged , which we argue is an acceptable approximation to the instability .",
    "the important result is that the final halos have an anisotropy distribution reminiscent of those from cosmological n - body simulation halos and a density profile akin to an nfw profile .",
    "an exploration of the parameter space of our models shows that the presence of a scalelength is insensitive to the relative sizes of the isotropic and radially anisotropic regions , and the anisotropy radii of halos are approximately equal to their density scalelengths .    if cosmological n - body simulations are environments in which the mild aspect of the radial orbit instability plays a significant role ( and they appear to be so ) , two central features of such simulations have a ready explanation .",
    "one is the seeming universality of halo density profiles which appears in both noncosmological and cosmological n - body simulations as srsic density profiles . a physical mechanism , like the mild aspect of the radial orbit instability , that generically acts in collapses , even when mergers are absent , provides a simple generator for such universality .",
    "the outcome of the instability is a variable anisotropy distribution with isotropic orbits in central regions and radially anisotropic orbits in outer regions .",
    "this anisotropy distribution gives rise to density profiles with scalelengths , the second defining feature of halos formed in cosmological n - body simulations .",
