    "in the eighties the numerous hydrogen lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines , called the _",
    "ly-@xmath0 forest _ , seen in the spectra of quasars were interpreted as revealing a population of intergalactic clouds ( see sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) .",
    "the advent of numerical simulations changed the understanding of the low column density ly-@xmath0 forest , @xmath9 , from a population of discrete clouds to a smooth medium with density fluctuations produced by the process of structure formation ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; petitjean et al . 1995 ; miralda - escud et al . 1996",
    "; zhang et al . 1998 ) .",

    "; theuns et al . 1998 ; machacek et al . 2000 ; efstathiou , schaye & theuns 2000 ) , also caused a change in the way we mathematically treat the absorption lines . since then the igm has become a unique tool to study the evolution of the gas in the universe ( becker et al .",
    "2011 , bolton et al . 2013 ) and the large scale structures in the universe ( e.g. croft et al .",
    "2002 , busca et al .",
    "2012 ) thanks to the dramatic increase in the statistics provided by quasar surveys like the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey from sdss - iii ( eisenstein et al . 2011 ; pris et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "because the gravity of the underlying dark matter dominates , it is often assumed that the igm constitutes a stochastic field of spatially random fluctuations , since the cosmic mass is randomly distributed . in this",
    "scenarioseveral statistical approaches as the flux decrement ( da ) , the flux power spectrum , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and principally the probability distribution of ly-@xmath0 pixel optical depths ( pdf ) , have been used to analyze the observed ly@xmath0 forest ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ; rollinde et al . 2005 ; guimares et al . 2007 ; becker et al . 2007 ; viel et al .",
    "2008 ) .    among the stochastic approaches , the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) was proposed ( peng et al . 1994 ) to analyze long - range power - law correlations in non stationary systems .",
    "one advantage of the dfa method is that it allows the long - range power - law correlations in signals with embedded polynomial trends that can mask the true correlations in the fluctuations of a noise signal .",
    "the dfa method has been applied to analyze dna and its evolution ( peng et al .",

    "we propose the application of the dfa method to investigate the correlation properties presented in the ly-@xmath0 forest of quasar spectra .",
    "the unidimensional sequence of each spectrum was used to estimate the spatial organization of the igm ( building blocks ) , which is done by looking at spatial correlations .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe the data .",
    "we present the dfa method in section iii and the result of the dfa method applied along the line of sight to quasars in section iv .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and conclude in section v.",
    "the observational data used in our analysis were obtained from two different observatories ( one in the north and another in the south ) and telescopes / instruments .",
    "the two observational programs are described below .",
    "the first observational data set used in our analysis was obtained from the ultra - violet and visible echelle spectrograph ( uves ) mounted on the eso kueyen 8.2 m telescope at the paranal observatory in the course of the eso - vlt large programme ( lp ) `` cosmological evolution of the inter galactic medium '' ( pi jacqueline bergeron ) .",
    "this programme has been devised to gather a homogeneous sample of echelle spectra of 18 bright qsos , with uniform spectral coverage , resolution and signal - to - noise ratio suitable for studying the intergalactic medium in the redshift range 1.7 @xmath1 z @xmath1 4.5 .",
    "spectra were obtained in service mode and observations were spread over four periods ( two years ) during 30 nights under good seeing conditions ( @xmath1 0.8 arcsec ) .",
    "the spectra have a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath2 40 to 80 per pixel and a spectral resolution @xmath10 45000 in the ly-@xmath0 forest region .",

    "we describe in this section the detrend fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , wich is designed to treat data sequences with statistical inohomogeneities , such as in quasar spectra arising from non stationarity of the signal .",
    "we treat the pixels in the ly-@xmath0 forest as a stochastic sequence x(s ) , s = 1, ... ,n ( see fig .",

    "the scaling exponent @xmath0 , quantifying the degree of the long - range correlations , can be obtained from the slope of a straight line fit to @xmath22 \\sim \\alpha \\times log(n)$ ] on a log - log plot .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath0 quantifying the degree of the space scale correlations , can take the following values : uncorrelated signal ( random walk ) yields @xmath23 , antipersistent correlations yields @xmath24 , and persistent correlations indicating the presence of spatial correlations yields @xmath25 .",
    "the values @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to @xmath28 noise and brownian motion , respectively .",
    "long - range negatively correlated fluctuations or changes yields @xmath29 , while the positively correlated fluctuations yields @xmath30 .",
    "the spatial density fluctuations in the igm are nonperiodic and constitute a stochastic field . among the stochastic approaches , the dfa method described in the previous section is aimed at demonstrating the presence of scale - invariant self - similar features ( correlation , memory ) in the spatial linear density variations along the los to quasars .    the dfa method was applied to the two available data sets separately .      the scaling analysis results for the ly-@xmath0 forest of each esi / keck spectrum are shown in figure [ keck_scale ] .",
    "note that the scaling variation is not the same on small and large scales .",

    "the average of all crossover points for the keck data occurs at about @xmath33 pixels .",
    "the pixels do not have a constant size in mpc , so @xmath34 pixels can not match a single distance but is in the range @xmath35 ( comoving ) with a mean value of @xmath36 that is used hereafter .    as @xmath3 is always larger than @xmath5 we do see stronger correlations on short average space scales up to @xmath36 .",
    "we can infer from figure [ keck_scale ] that the fluctuation function presents the same pattern among the different lines - of - sight .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath0 does not vary significantly for different lines - of - sight .",
    "this can be considered as a confirmation about the isotropy of the igm on large scales .",
    "regarding the variation of @xmath0 with respect to scale , in figure [ keck_scale ] we can see that for scales n below @xmath37 pixels the scaling exponent is larger than 1.5 , reflecting highly deterministic correlations that can be related to the `` jeans lenght '' ( see bi et al . 1992 ; fang et al .",
    "1993 ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 ; nusser 2000 ) .",
    "the scaling exponent decays with respect to scale n , approaching an asymptotic value of @xmath38 and is characterized by the positive long - range weak correlation / persistency that can be related to the skeletonized weak clustering present in the igm on large scales .    in fig .",

    "we can also convert the @xmath0 scaling exponent , in a fractal dimension that generalises our intuitive concepts of dimension .",
    "@xmath39    we obtained for scales below @xmath36 ( comoving ) an average fractal dimension value of @xmath40 and for scales above @xmath36 until @xmath41 ( comoving ) an average fractal dimension value of @xmath42 .",
    "cold dark matter models of density fluctuations predict that at scales below @xmath43 we detect values of d smaller than 2 , with @xmath44 on scales larger than @xmath45 ( de gouveia dal pino et al .",

    "the crossover point for the uves data occurs at about @xmath48 pixels .",
    "however as for the esi / keck sample the pixels do not have a constant size in mpc , so @xmath49 pixels can not match a single distance but at a range of distances @xmath50 ( comoving ) .",
    "note that the spectral resolution is not the same for both instruments esi / keck - uves / vlt which means that pixel sizes are different .",

    "the present study investigates fluctuations in the density field of the igm using an extended random walk analysis , referred to as dfa .",
    "the advantage of the dfa method is that it can more accurately quantify the correlation property of original signals , even if masked by nonstationarity ( in the form of the trends ) compared with traditional methods such as flux decrement , power spectrum analysis , cumulative distribution function and probability distribution function .",
    "futhermore the dfa is not sensitive to continuous level uncertainties .    the dfa plots ,",

    ".    the small scale scaling exponent estimated from the esi / keck set of data , @xmath57 , and from the uves / vlt set of data , @xmath58 , are larger than 1.5 indicating positive strong spatial autocorrelation or persistency in the subsequent increases or decreases . in the long - range regime",
    "the scaling exponents for the set of esi / keck data is @xmath59 and that from the uves / vlt set of data is @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that on longer scales we found a weaker positive correlation or persistency than on short range scales . we can interpret this transition with scale as a transition from clumpiness to homogeneity .",
