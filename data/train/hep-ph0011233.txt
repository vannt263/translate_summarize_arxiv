    "it is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) being the most promising extension of the standard model offers a solution of the hierarchy problem , possesses gauge coupling unification and naturally proposes a dark matter candidate   the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in the framework of the low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) ,",
    "when susy breaking masses lie below a few tev , sparticles will be copiously produced ( and detected ) at future colliders like the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "on the other hand , there are several on - going and future projects searching for the lsp as a dark matter particle .",
    "one of them even claims a positive signal @xcite , although the situation remains rather contradictory @xcite .",
    "the present experimental upper limit on the spin - independent part of the elastic scattering of the lsp on a nucleon is around @xmath2  pb for @xmath3  gev . in any case",
    ", it seems very plausible that both , susy collider signals and lsp dark matter will be found in future .",
    "such dark matter searches offer interesting prospects for beating accelerators in the discovery of susy , particularly during the coming years before the lhc enters operation @xcite .",
    "in this situation naturally arised the question of how small the event rate of the lsp direct detection can be , provided the lsp is a cold dark matter particle .",
    "searching for the answer different susy models were considered ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recently exciting evidence for a flat and accelerating universe was obtained @xcite .",
    "the position of the first acoustic peak of the angular power spectrum strongly suggests a flat universe with density parameter @xmath4 while the shape of the peak is consistent with the density perturbations predicted by models of inflation .",
    "the density parameter @xmath5 is the ratio of the current mass density @xmath6 to the critical density @xmath7g@xmath8@xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the dimensionless hubble parameter .",
    "data support the straight line @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the matter density in the universe and @xmath13 is the contribution of the non - zero cosmological constant ( the energy density of the vacuum ) . at the same time one determines @xmath14 , which implies @xmath15 , a value that has been supported from high - redshifted supernova data @xcite . since the baryonic matter density is small , @xmath16 , the values for matter density @xmath12 give a cold dark matter ( cdm ) density @xmath17 , which combined with recent measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath18 , result in smaller cdm relic densities @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "previously we have restricted our analyses to the cosmological constraint for the relic density of the lsp in the range @xmath20 @xcite , where the neutralino relic density parameter @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the relic neutralino mass density . in this paper adopting the above - mentioned new cosmological data and going to compare our estimation with literature @xcite we constrain the allowed region for the neutralino relic density in the form @xmath23 .",
    "it is possible that there is more than one component in the cold dark matter , so that @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath25 .",
    "although , in general , a decrease of @xmath26 is associated with larger elastic scattering cross sections , the detection rate also must be reduced because of the corresponding reduction in the density of lsps in the galactic halo . here",
    "we neglect this possibility and assume that all the cold dark matter is composed of lsps , so that @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "there are two main approaches to evaluate the dark - matter - neutralino nucleon cross section and the expected event rate in a detector .",
    "the basis of the first approach is the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model @xcite .",
    "this model assumes the minimal supersymmetric standard model to be valid at all energy scales from @xmath28 up to @xmath29gev .",
    "the msugra model arises as the low - energy limit of a supergravity theory , where supersymmetry is broken in the hidden sector of the model at an energy scale of @xmath30 gev .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector via gravitational interactions , leading to soft susy breaking mass terms of the order of the electroweak scale . at the gut scale",
    "this leads to a common mass for all scalars @xmath31 and a common trilinear coupling @xmath32 .",
    "motivated by the apparent unification of gauge coupling constants , it is also assumed that all gaugino masses are unified to @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "the weak scale sparticle spectrum is derived from renormalization group running of the susy soft breaking parameters .",
    "requiring radiative electroweak symmetry breaking allows the determination of the superpotential higgsino mass squared @xmath35 , and allows the expression of the soft susy breaking bilinear term @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "thus , all sparticle masses and couplings are derived in terms of the minimal  parameter set @xmath38 @xcite . from a practical point of view",
    "this approach as much as possible relies on theoretical arguments like unification , naturalness etc , aiming to maximally reduce the set of free parameters and obtain maximally restricted predictions . in this approach",
    "@xcite the quantum stability of the gauge hierarchy suggests that sparticles weigh less than about 1  tev @xcite , which is also the range favored for a cold dark matter particle , and there are indeed generic domains of the mssm parameter space in which the relic lsp density falls within the range favored by astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the unsuccessful laboratory searches for sparticles impose non - trivial constraints on the mssm parameter space , suggesting that the lsp neutralino is mainly a @xmath39 gaugino ( bino ) @xcite . in the mssm",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath40 is a mixture of four superpartners of gauge and higgs bosons ( bino , wino and two higgsinos ) : @xmath41 it is commonly accepted that @xmath42 is mostly gaugino - like if @xmath43 and higgsino - like if @xmath44 , or mixed otherwise .",
    "it is due to the bino - likeness of the relic neutralinos that the calculated neutralino - nucleon cross sections appeared very small and one usually arrived at the conclusion that it was hardly possible to reach the msugra space by means of direct and indirect searches for dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "the other side of this conclusion is also well known : when @xmath45 decreases , the higgsino components @xmath46 and @xmath47 of @xmath42 increase ( @xmath48 decreases ) and as a result the spin - independent cross section increases .",
    "so higgsino - like ( and mixed ) neutralino on the other hand increases the prospect for its detection as a dark matter particle @xcite",
    ". therefore it seems a crucial question here , to what extent the neutralino is mostly gaugino - like , higgsino - like , or mixed .",
    "a way to look for any possibility of higher cross sections and higher expected rates of detection is to investigate alternate models .",
    "the basis of it is a departure from the stringent msugra by means of a relaxation of some unification and other theoretical assumptions aiming to obtain as general predictions for the expected detection rate as possible .",
    "a remarkable shift from msugra to more relaxed models was made by @xcite .",
    "it mostly included relaxation of unification of soft scalar mass parameters ( so called nonuniversal soft symmetry breaking ) as well as gaugino mass non - universality .",
    "the large @xmath37 regime was also considered as a source of higher cross sections .",
    "indeed in canonical msugra it was pointed out @xcite that the large @xmath37 regime allows regions where @xmath49pb .",
    "besides , with non - universal soft scalar masses , it was also found that @xmath49pb for small values of @xmath37 . in particular , this was obtained for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) working with universal ( non - universal ) soft terms in @xcite .",
    "these analyses were performed assuming ( non-)universality of the soft breaking terms at the unification scale , @xmath52 gev , which can be obtained within superstring theories @xcite and heterotic m - theory @xcite .",
    "completely new possibilities have also been discussed .",
    "for example , it is found that in supersymmetry models muli - tev scalar masses can exist consistent with naturalness on a certain branch of the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon appears in the so - called focus point supersymmetry models where one also avoids naturalness constraints with multi - tev scalars @xcite , and in models with moving intermediate unification scale @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that the assumptions concerning universality of the scalar masses @xmath53 , and the trilinear scalar couplings @xmath54 , are not very solid , at least from phenomenological point of view , since , universality might occur at a scale higher than @xmath55  gev @xcite , or according to string models at a scale @xmath56 smaller than @xmath57gev @xcite .",
    "it was realized that the string scale may be anywhere between the weak scale and the planck scale .",
    "for instance d - brane configurations allow these possibilities in type i strings @xcite .",
    "similar results can also be obtained in type ii strings @xcite and weakly and strongly coupled heterotic strings @xcite .",
    "moreover the @xmath56 might be anywhere between the weak scale and the planck scale @xcite , with significant consequences for the size of the neutralino - nucleon cross section .",
    "the case of non - universal gaugino masses was analyzed in @xcite and with respect to direct detection of the superlight dark matter neutralinos in @xcite .",
    "schemes with cp - violating phases one can find in @xcite .    therefore due to the large uncertainties involved in the choice of the scale @xmath56 and going to obtain as much as general predictions it appeared more convenient to work within a phenomenological susy model whose parameters are defined directly at the electroweak scale as for example in @xcite and which is denoted as an effective scheme of mssm ( effmssm ) in @xcite .",
    "obviously , this way much larger expected event rates were obtained and optimistic conclusions concerning the possibility to constrain significantly the susy parameter space with dark matter experiments were drawn @xcite .    in our previous calculations in effmssm",
    "@xcite we have adopted an ( effective ) scheme ( with non - universal scalar masses and with non - universal gaugino soft masses ) which has supplied us with large relatively direct detection rates of dark matter neutralinos , practically independently of what is the neutralino composition . in most of the mssm parameter space",
    "we , in agreement with others , have obtained at the detectable level mostly gaugino - like neutralinos , but always existed small higgsino admixtures ( at a level less than 1 - 5% ) which managed to produce large enough cross sections and rates .    in 1994",
    "we claimed that nuclear spin is not important for detection of dark matter particles , provided the detection sensitivity does not exceed 0.01 events@xmath58day@xmath58 kg , which was considered that time as unreachable @xcite .",
    "now the situation has changed and we would like to notice that for targets with spin - non - zero nuclei it might be the spin - dependent interaction that determines the lower bound for the direct detection rate when the cross section of the scalar interaction , which is usually assumed to be the dominant part , drops below @xmath59pb @xcite .",
    "new updated parameters of the nucleon structure involved in the evaluation of the elastic neutralino nucleon scattering have become available @xcite and one expects that they will affect the cross sections of neutralino nucleon scattering .",
    "at least significant cancellations may occur for some values of @xmath37 for scalar- and spin - dependent cross sections ( at least for @xmath60 @xcite ) .",
    "the above considerations stimulated us to perform a recalculation of our previous analysis .",
    "a dark matter event is elastic scattering of a relic neutralino from a target nucleus producing a nuclear recoil which can be detected by a suitable detector @xcite . the differential event rate in respect to the recoil energy is the subject of experimental measurements .",
    "the rate depends on the distribution of the relic neutralinos in the solar vicinity and the cross section of neutralino - nucleus elastic scattering . in our analysis",
    "we use the total event rate @xmath61 which is integrated over recoil energies and useful for searching for domains with extreme rates .",
    "we follow our papers @xcite , where one can find all relevant formulas and astrophysical parameters .",
    "we consider only a simple spherically symmetric isothermal distribution and do not go into details of any possible uncertainties ( and/or modulation effects ) of the galactic halo wimp distribution @xcite .    to calculate the event rate we use for the relic neutralino mass density and for the escape neutralino velocity commonly accepted values 0.3  gev@xmath58@xmath62 and 600 km@xmath58s , respectively .",
    "their experimental variations can slightly change @xmath61 but leave the dependence of @xmath61 on the mssm parameters unaffected . to compare our results with other calculations and sensitivities of different dark matter experiments we calculate also the total cross section for relic neutralino elastic scattering on the nucleon .",

    "the two corridors do ovelap .",
    "the inaccuracy maximally changes the proton - neutralino cross section ( event rate ) within about one order of magnitude .",
    "the value chosen in this work gives probably a more pessimistic view of the cross sections .",
    "the inaccuracy of other parameters has a smaller effect on the cross sections .",
    "the factors @xmath74 parameterize the quark spin content of the nucleon . a global qcd analysis for the @xmath75 structure functions",
    "@xcite , including @xmath76 corrections , corresponds to the values @xcite",
    "@xmath77    we calculate @xmath78 following the standard procedure on the basis of the approximate formula @xcite .",
    "we take into account all channels of the @xmath79 annihilation . since the neutralinos are mixtures of gauginos and higgsinos , the annihilation can occur both , via s - channel exchange of the @xmath80 and higgs bosons and t - channel exchange of a scalar particle .",
    "this constrains the parameter space @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we require @xmath23 , for comparison we also present our results when @xmath81 .",
    "another stringent constraint is imposed by the branching ratio of @xmath82 decay , measured by the cleo collaboration to be @xmath83 . in the mssm this flavor - changing neutral current process receives contributions from @xmath84@xmath85 , @xmath86@xmath87 and @xmath88@xmath89 loops in addition to the standard model @xmath90@xmath85 loop .",
    "this also restricts the susy parameter space @xcite .",
    "the masses of the supersymmetric particles are constrained by the results from the high energy colliders .",
    "this imposes relevant constraints on the parameter space of the mssm .",
    "in @xcite we used the following lower bounds for the susy particles @xcite : @xmath91  gev for the light chargino , @xmath92  gev for the heavy chargino , @xmath93  gev for non - lsp neutralinos , respectively ; @xmath94  gev for sneutrinos , @xmath95  gev for selectrons , @xmath96  gev for squarks , @xmath97  gev for light top - squark , @xmath98  gev for neutral higgs bosons , @xmath99  gev for the charged higgs boson .",
    "on the basis of last lep results @xcite we use now new lower limits for charginos : @xmath100gev , and neutral higgs bosons : @xmath101gev .    as previously @xcite we explore the mssm parameter space at the weak scale relaxing completely constraints following from any unification assumption .",
    "nevertheless we respect other available restrictions from cosmology , accelerator susy searches , rare fcnc @xmath82 decay , etc @xcite .",
    "the mssm parameter space is determined by entries of the mass matrices of neutralinos , charginos , higgs bosons , sleptons and squarks .",
    "the relevant definitions one can find in @xcite .",
    "the list of free parameters includes : @xmath37 is the ratio of neutral higgs boson vacuum expectation values , @xmath102 is the bilinear higgs parameter of the superpotential , @xmath103 are soft gaugino masses , @xmath104 is the cp - odd higgs mass , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) are squared squark ( slepton ) mass parameters for the 1st and 2nd generation , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) are squared squark ( slepton ) mass parameters for 3rd generation and @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 are soft trilinear couplings for the 3rd generation . in our numerical analysis the parameters of the mssm are randomly varied in the following intervals : @xmath118 following @xcite we assume that squarks are basically degenerate .",
    "bounds on flavor - changing neutral currents imply that squarks with equal gauge quantum numbers must be close in mass . with the possible exception of third generation squarks the assumed degeneracy therefore holds almost model - independently @xcite .",
    "therefore for other sfermion mass parameters we used the relations @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 . the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 are fixed to be zero .",
    "we consider the domain of the mssm parameter space , in which we perform our scans , as quite spread and natural .",
    "any extra expansion of it like , for example , using @xmath123  tev@xmath124  10  tev , etc , of course , can be possible , but should be considered , contrary to @xcite , as quite unnatural .",
    "the effects of coannihilation may become important when the next to the lowest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) has a mass which lies close to the lsp mass @xcite .",
    "the size of the effects is exponentially damped by the factor @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and where @xmath128 is the lsp mass . because of this damping the coannihilation effects are typically important only for regions of the parameter space where the constraint @xmath129 is satisfied .",
    "some of the possible candidates for nlsp are the light stau @xmath130 , @xmath131 , the next to the lightest neutralino @xmath132 , and the light chargino @xmath133 .",
    "it was found that in msugra the upper limit on the neutralino mass consistent with the current experimental constraints on the relic density is extended from 200 gev to 600 gev @xcite when the effects of @xmath134 coannihilation are included .    by means of excluding points which can give non - negligible contribution to relic neutralino annihilation via coannihilations with other susy particles we simply have estimates of the influence of the coannihilation to our previous results .",
    "we used the constraint : @xmath135 , where @xmath136 runs over next - to - lsp neutralino , charginos , staus , stops etc . in accordance with previous estimates of @xcite",
    "we found that the coannihilation does not significantly change our main results .",
    "in fact , less than 20% of the models were denied by this coannihilation constraint , which in the case of @xmath20 excludes points with simultaneously small @xmath45 ( @xmath137gev ) and large @xmath138 ( @xmath139gev ) , allowing for a substantial non - gaugino fraction of the lsp only in the region of relatively small @xmath45 .",
    "if the relic abundance of neutralinos is located in the range @xmath0 , the coannihilation constraint appears less restrictive .",
    "our calculations with the updated nucleon structure @xcite for the wimp - nucleon cross section of both spin and scalar interactions as function of the wimp mass are depicted below as scatter plots ( figs .",
    "[ crosssections][spinandscalar ] ) .",
    "the use of the updated parameters ( [ proton - update])([spin - update ] ) does not change significantly the general distribution of points over the scatter plots as compared with calculations with earlier nucleon parameters @xcite used in @xcite .",

    "one can see that the reduction of the allowed domain for the relic density does not significantly affect spin - dependent and the spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross sections , i.e. restriction to a flat and accelerating universe weakly affects these cross sections .    the different behavior of these cross sections with mass of the lsp can be seen from the plots .",
    "there is a more stringent lower bound for the spin - dependent cross section .",
    "it is at a level of @xmath140pb , which is about an order of magnitude larger then the one presented in @xcite , where for small @xmath37 ( @xmath141 , and small @xmath142 ) the effect of a cancellation induced by the difference in signs between @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( [ spin - update ] ) was reported . aside from the cancellation , the spin - dependent cross section peaks at about @xmath145 pb and drops rapidly as @xmath142 increases down to @xmath146  pb at @xmath147  gev @xcite .",

    "it is also worth noting that , for any fixed value of @xmath56 , the larger @xmath37 is , the larger the higgsino contributions become .",
    "also it is claimed @xcite that in the specific context of minimal supergravity ( focus point regime ) , a cosmologically stable mixed gaugino - higgsino state emerges as an excellent , robust dark matter candidate .",
    "the claim relies on recent arguments , that all squark and slepton masses can be taken well above 1 tev with no loss of naturalness on the basis of a seemingly reasonable objective definition of naturalness @xcite .",
    "the mathematical basis of this result is the existence of focus points in renormalization group trajectories , which render the weak scale ( i.e. , the higgs potential ) largely insensitive to variations in unknown supersymmetry parameters . while in these models",
    "the squark and slepton masses are unusually large , the electroweak gaugino and higgsino particle masses are generically well below 1 tev .",
    "the increase of the common soft scalar mass @xmath31 far beyond 1 tev associated with decrease of @xmath45 below the gaugino masses , @xmath156 , leads to significant mixing between higgsino and gaugino states accompanied by higgs boson diagrams enhancement .",

    "in addition to the lep constraints , this is because the value of @xmath102 is predicted as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath31 , placing the lsp firmly in the bino - like region .",
    "the same considerations exclude an lsp with mixed higgsino / gaugino content .    in the sugra framework of @xcite the elastic scattering cross sections , which are predicted for the lsp mass @xmath142 lie in a comparatively narrow band .",
    "this is essentially because the lsp is always mainly bino - like , so its couplings do not depend greatly on other mssm parameters such as @xmath31 .",
    "the principal causes of broadening are the uncertainties in the hadronic inputs and the possibilities of cancellations that may reduce the cross sections for some specific values of the constrained mssm parameters @xcite .",
    "figure [ crosssections - d ] shows that while the spin cross section displays almost full insensivity to @xmath102 and @xmath104 ( higgs bosons do not contribute ) the scalar cross section possesses remarkable dependence on these parameters .",
    "the cross section rather quickly drops with growth of the cp - odd higgs mass @xmath104 and increases with @xmath37 in accordance with results of @xcite .",
    "the different @xmath37- and @xmath104-dependence of spin - dependent and spin - independent cross section as well as general about-4-order - of - magnitude excess of spin - dependent cross section over spin - independent cross sections may be important for observations @xcite .      to be more definite with the statement claimed above , in fig .",
    "[ spinandscalar ] we present a comparison of total spin - dependent versus total spin - independent event rates in @xmath157ge ( spin@xmath158 )   as representative and one of the most promising isotopes for future construction of high - sensitivity detectors .",
    "figure [ spinandscalar ] shows the weak dependence of the ratio on mass of the lsp with the mean value being approximately 0.010.1 .",
    "there are very large and very small values for the ratio practically for any given mass of the lsp .",
    "the spin - independent ( scalar ) contribution obviously dominates in the domain of large expected rates in the germanium detector ( @xmath159events@xmath58day@xmath58 kg ) as was obtained before ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "but as soon as the total rate drops down to @xmath160events@xmath58day@xmath58 kg or , equivalently , the scalar neutralino - proton cross section becomes smaller than @xmath161pb , the spin - dependent interaction may produce a rather non - negligible contribution to the total event rate .",
    "moreover if the scalar cross section decreases further ( @xmath162pb ) , it becomes obvious that the spin contribution alone saturates the total rate and protects it ( see lower bounds in fig .",
    "[ crosssections - e ] and [ crosssections - d ] ) from decreasing below @xmath163events@xmath58day@xmath58 kg @xcite .",
    "this observation could be quite important for experiments actually looking for direct _ detection _  of dark matter , but not only for exclusion plots .",
    "indeed , while scalar cross sections governed mostly by higgs exchange can be rather small ( when higgs masses remain large enough , for example in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite ) the spin cross section can not be arbitrary small , because the mass of the @xmath164 boson , which gives the dominant contribution , is well defined , provided one ignores any possible fine - tuning cancellations @xcite .    therefore ,",
    "if an experiment with sensitivity @xmath165events@xmath58day@xmath58 kg fails to detect a dark matter signal , an experiment with higher sensitivity ( and non - zero spin target ) will be able to detect dark matter particles only due to the spin neutralino - quark interaction .",
    "( 100,140 ) ( -5,-41 )",
    "recent measurements in modern cosmology have changed the expected fraction of the cold dark matter in the universe , new results for the nucleon structure were obtained , a new generation of high - sensitivity experimental detectors are under consideration .",
    "all these changes stimulated us to recalculate our previous analysis concerning detection of cold dark matter .",
    "to this end we explored the mssm parameter space at the weak scale where new accelerator and cosmological constraints are respected .",
    "we restrict the relic neutralino density to be in the range @xmath166 .",
    "we considered the variation of the spin - independent and spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross sections and of the expected event rate in @xmath157ge , with parameters of the mssm , uncertainties of the nucleon structure and other theoretical assumptions like universality and coannihilation .",
    "the results of our updated calculations fall in general agreement with calculations performed in msugra as well as with other less restrictive approaches , which allowed larger variation of the cross sections and detection rates .    \\2 .",
    "the use of the updated parameters of the nucleon structure does not change significantly the general distribution of points over the scatter plots as compared with calculations with earlier nucleon parameters .",
    "\\3 . in accordance with previous estimations we found that the coannihilation does not significantly change our main conclusions .",
    "we understand that our estimation of the coannihilation effect is somewhat indirect , but in the effmssm approach there is no stringent correlation between parameters , which sometimes makes the coannihilation channels inevitable .",
    "the new cosmological constraint on the relic neutralino density ( due to flat and accelerating universe ) which is numerically used in the form @xmath0 in our approach does not significantly affect the resulting scatter plots for neutralino - nucleon elastic cross sections .",
    "\\5 . to single out ( mostly in the msugra )",
    "theoretically a dominant contribution to the cross section or event rate one usually relies on the knowledge of the lsp composition .",
    "for example , as discussed through this paper , if the bino fraction is large , then the cross section is small .",
    "numerically the situation is less transparent . as seen from fig .",
    "[ spinandscalar ] ( upper right ) the overwhelming majority of points ( the region of highest point density ) has @xmath167 , or very small higgsino admixture and one should expect negligible event rate .",
    "nevertheless this is not the case .",
    "there are a lot of points with sizable event rate for @xmath167 .",
    "therefore qualitative estimations of the dominance of the given contribution on the basis , for example , of large gaugino fraction of the lsp ( @xmath168 ) can be quantitatively not always correct .",
    "we notice that for targets with spin - non - zero nuclei it might be the _ spin - dependent interaction _  that determines the lower bound for the direct detection rate when the cross section of the scalar interaction drops below about @xmath1pb .",
    "if this occurs the spin nuclear detectors would have notable advantage comparing with spinless detectors , or may become the only way to observe susy via direct dark matter detection .    finally we would like to stress again the fact , clearly seen from figs .",
    "[ wimp - proton ] and [ wimp - proton - tanb ] , that to reliably investigate the susy parameter space and therefore to have a chance to beat accelerator experiments in searching for ( or discovery of ) the new physics ( supersymmetry ) one needs a genius - like detector .",

    "<S> we update our exploration of the mssm parameter space at the weak scale where new accelerator and cosmological constraints are respected . the dependence of wimp - nucleon cross sections on parameters of the mssm , uncertainties of the nucleon structure and other theoretical assumptions like universality and co - annihilation are considered . in particular , we find that the coannihilation does not have a significant effect in our analysis in certain regions which are allowed even with coannihilation </S>",
    "<S> . the new cosmological constraint on the relic neutralino density used in the form @xmath0 does also not significantly affect the regions of allowed neutralino - nucleon cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that for nuclear targets with spin the spin - dependent interaction may determine the lower bound for the direct detection rate when the cross section of the scalar interaction drops below about @xmath1pb . </S>"
