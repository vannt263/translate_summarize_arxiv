    "the standard model to describe the untwisting and separation of both strands of a free dna double - helix in solution is the poland - scheraga helix - coil model , where each base pair can be in two possible states , helix ( closed ) or coil ( open ) @xcite .",
    "addition of entropy weights to a basic ising model , counting the number of possible configurations of open loops , induces an effective long range interaction between base pairs which is essential for correctly obtaining the helix specific opening probabilities .",

    "incorporating the fixman - freire approximation @xcite for the loop entropy factor reduces the computational complexity from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in the sequence length @xmath3 . with the availability of fully sequenced genomes ,",
    "the study of dna melting or denaturation has become an active field of research again , with recent results relating the physics of denaturation to the biology of genomes @xcite , reparameterizing the original loop entropy weights @xcite , speeding up the poland - fixman - freire algorithm for whole genome sequences @xcite , and generalizing the model to describe hybridization with mismatches of unequal length sequences @xcite . the traditional physics approach to compute statistical mechanical probabilities by transfer matrix multiplication @xcite",
    "has also recently been revisited by poland @xcite .",
    "while this last algorithm offers no improvement in computational complexity ( using matrix sparsity it is @xmath1 ) , it is very simple and straightforward to implement .    _ in vivo _ dna strand separation involves interactions with other molecules which impose superhelical stresses on the dna molecule .",
    "this is modeled by benham s statistical mechanical model for stress induced duplex destabilization ( sidd ) @xcite , which also is a helix - coil model with ising degrees of freedom .",
    "it has a long range base pair interaction arising through superhelical constraints ( no loop entropy factors are added ) , and opening probabilities are known to correlate very well with regions important for transcriptional regulation @xcite .",
    "an exact solution of the model is @xmath1 but an accelerated algorithm using an energy cut - off reduces this to @xmath2 , such that sidd properties can be computed for whole genome sequences as well @xcite .    in parallel with the helix - coil models ,",
    "a distinct class of statistical mechanical models for dna melting has been developed starting from a physically more realistic description of a base pair as an entity which has a continuum of intermediate states in between helix or coil .",
    "these models are all based on the peyrard - bishop model @xcite which consists of a nonlinear particle lattice with one real degree of freedom per base pair describing the stretching of the hydrogen bonds between the bases .",
    "nonlinearity and cooperativety in such a model arises already with a nearest - neighbor interaction , no long - range interaction is needed @xcite .",
    "subsequent improvements to the model include replacing the harmonic by an anharmonic stacking energy @xcite , and introducing an additional angular degree of freedom per base pair to model the helicoidal structure of dna @xcite . in the latter model , separation of the two strands",
    "is coupled to untwisting of the double helix .",
    "the effect of sequence inhomogeneity on the melting transition in the peyrard - bishop model with harmonic and anharmonic stacking has been studied for random sequences @xcite and for periodic sequences @xcite .",
    "recent experimental developments ( see @xcite for a review ) have made it possible to manipulate single polymeric molecules directly and thus offer access to a whole new range of dna properties other than the melting phenomenon .",
    "these elasticity experiments too can be accurately modeled by yet another type of statistical mechanical models consisting of a double - helix with non - opening base pairs connected by flexible , folding backbones @xcite . in this paper",
    "however , we will be concerned with the melting transition only and the connection between the continuous particle - lattice models and the discrete helix - coil models .",
    "unlike the helix - coil models , which have seen many applications to real biological sequences , the particle - lattice models are mostly used to obtain a more fundamental , sequence independent , physical understanding of the dna melting phenomenon , such as the order of the phase transition , the existence of nonlinear ` bubble ' excitations , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review paper ) . moreover , although both types of models have been validated against ( different ) experiments , very little is known about how they relate to one another and whether they are in some sense equivalent . here",
    ", we attempt to close the gap between both kinds of models .",
    "we study an inhomogeneous particle - lattice model based on the barbi - cocco - peyrard helicoidal model @xcite and compute its melting properties for some standard example sequences both under free conditions and with superhelical stresses .",
    "the thermally induced melting of free dna is obtained as the formally very simple transfer integral equilibrium solution of the helicoidal model , yet computation of the melting properties is a challenge in itself as , e.g. , a computation of the partition function involves @xmath2 numerical integrations over an infinite integration domain .",
    "however , zhang et al . @xcite already observed that for the dauxois - peyrard - bishop model @xcite , the numerical integrations can be carried out using a very limited number of discretization points : a dimension as small as @xmath4 gave very accurate results compared to much higher dimensions ( @xmath5 and more ) , and by allowing an error of order @xmath6 with respect to the exact results , the dimension could be further reduced to @xmath7 . for the helicoidal model , we have found a value of @xmath8 to be the minimal discretization dimension .",
    "this effectively reduces the particle - lattice model to a nearest - neighbor generalized ising model , offering the possibility to develop a very simple and very fast algorithm to compute dna melting probabilities .",
    "we propose such an algorithm which moreover is numerically stable for arbitrary sequence lengths , avoiding underflow problems related to the extensivity of the free energy ( i.e. , the exponential vanishing of the partition function for diverging sequence length ) .",
    "the algorithm is as simple as poland s matrix algorithm @xcite and as fast as any of the fastest helix - coil algorithms discussed above .",
    "extension of the algorithm to compute correlations between different base pairs , loop opening probabilities , higher order moments for base pair opening , etc . is trivial and straightforward .",
    "stress induced dna melting is modeled by imposing a fixed linking number constraint on the dna strands , which leads to a coupling of all angular degrees of freedom in the model . however , the linking number is thermodynamically conjugated to an external torque variable applied at both ends of the molecule .",
    "the model with external torque can be solved by the above transfer matrix algorithm , and although there is no equivalence of ensembles , the fixed linking number solution can be obtained by a complex integration over the torque variable .",
    "the numerical solution is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant independent of @xmath3 determined by the desired accuracy of the torque integration , a situation similar to the analysis of stress induced dna melting using benham s sidd model @xcite .",
    "we consider the helicoidal model introduced by barbi , cocco and peyrard @xcite .",
    "unlike the original homogeneous model , the various energy parameters will be explicitly sequence dependent .",
    "a dna sequence is a string of @xmath3 letters @xmath11 , which for convenience we translate ( alphabetically ) into a numerical sequence @xmath12 taking values in @xmath13 .",
    "each base pair in the model has two degrees of freedom , a radial variable @xmath14 , related to the opening of the hydrogen bonds , and an angular variable @xmath15 , related to the twisting of the base pair and responsible for the @xmath16-dimensional structure of the dna molecule .",
    "successive angles are restricted to @xmath17 $ ] to enforce helical geometry .",

    "we note here that the present model is only suitable for negative or small positive torque @xmath25 . indeed , unwinding leads to denaturation and",
    "this is well described by the potential energy ( [ eq:1 ] ) , but severe overwinding leads to new dna forms with exposed bases and the backbone winding at the center @xcite .",
    "such transition can obviously not be part of the present model .    a variety of boundary conditions ( b.c .",

    ", fixed b.c . , or periodic b.c . , with minor modifications to the numerical solution of the model .",
    "for the angular variable @xmath15 we consider two distinct situations .",
    "the first is to set @xmath26 and have no constraint on @xmath27 , corresponding to free b.c . for the variables @xmath28 , and describing the situation in some single molecule experiments @xcite .",
    "the second situation , modeling superhelical stresses , is to set a fixed linking number constraint @xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] , which contains periodic b.c . in @xmath15 as the special case @xmath31 , @xmath32 the torque @xmath25 and the total twist @xmath33 are thermodynamically conjugated variables , yet as we are explicitly working with a finite - size system , there is no equivalence of ensembles and both situations lead to different melting properties .",
    "we will refer to the first situation as the _ ` torque ensemble ' _ and the second as the _ ` linking number ensemble'_.    the choice of the energetic parameters is a difficult one and unlike for the helix - coil models , no well established set of parameters exists , especially with respect to the base pair dependence of the different energy terms .",
    "morse potential constants for weakly bonded @xmath34 vs. strongly bonded @xmath35 base pairs have been determined by comparison of the dauxois - peyrard - bishop model with denaturation experiments @xcite . for the other parameters , we follow the classification of el hassan and calladine @xcite .",
    "more precisely we take @xmath36 inversely proportional to the slide variance of the step @xmath37 , and @xmath38 inversely proportional to the twist variance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) . to obtain explicit values ,",
    "we first adapt the relative strength of the energy parameters such that their order of magnitude agrees with the parameters used in @xcite . in that case",
    "we obtain the correct transition temperature interval , but a less perfect differential melting map ( a melting map gives for each base pair the temperature at which it transforms from closed to open , see @xcite and section [ sec : res_tq ] ) . by increasing the relative strength of the twist energy ,",
    "the transition interval is widened , but the melting map becomes exact . to compute opening probabilities and melting maps , and identify stable vs. unstable regions , this last set of parameters is more adequate .",
    "a more detailed comparison with experiment will be needed to find the parameters which best fit the physical melting transition , but we do not pursue this further in this paper .",
    "all the explicit numerical values we use are given in appendix [ sec : energy - parameters ] . to conclude , we mention that in the torque ensemble , to first order , sequence specificity in the melting process comes from the base pair specific morse potentials , but inhomogeneity in the stacking and twist energies has second order effects which are nonetheless important for a detailed identification of the different melting domains . in the linking number ensemble , the coupling of all angular degrees of freedom leads to more complicated sequence specific melting behavior .",

    "the most efficient way for doing this is approximating the integrals in the partition function by finite sums using gaussian quadratures @xcite .",

    "we determined a value @xmath117 to give accurate results in comparison with the meltsim program @xcite .",
    "like in the peyrard - bishop model @xcite , we then found that @xmath62 could be further decreased with negligible error , to a value of @xmath118 . further reducing the dimension leads to a dramatic change where suddenly all the interesting transitional behavior is lost ,",
    "the chain is either completely open , or completely closed .",

    "if @xmath126 is much larger than the typical _ correlation _ length , this gives the exact opening probability for the full sequence . in the helix - coil model , such a cut is never exact because @xmath126 is always smaller than the _ interaction _ length . in section [ sec :",

    "therefore , a window size of length @xmath128 and overlap @xmath129 between @xmath130 and @xmath131 leads to an exact algorithm for long sequences whose speed is only mildly affected by the windowing procedure .",

    "the overall identification of stable vs. unstable regions remains intact , but comparison with figure [ fig:2 ] shows that considerable detail in the melting map is lost , with larger regions melting at once .    , @xmath204 , @xmath205 ) ( temperature increment @xmath206 , @xmath207 ) . ]    figure [ fig:6 ] shows the effect of changing the relative strength of the stacking and twisting energy terms .",
    "again they are taken homogeneous , but now with the original values of barbi et al . @xcite .",
    "although with these values the transition temperature interval is of the right magnitude , the differential melting curve and melting map clearly display insufficient detail .",
    "most notably , the two distinct unstable regions around positions @xmath208 and @xmath209 are merged into one large region .    , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) ( temperature increment @xmath206 , @xmath207 ) .",
    "]    so far , we have shown results for a chosen value @xmath199 for easy comparison between different figures , but other values can be considered as well . at fixed temperature , increasing @xmath25 decreases the fraction of open base pairs , corresponding to an increase in the phase transition temperature in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . what is perhaps more interesting is the fact that increasing @xmath25 also smooths the differential melting curve ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) , and broadens the transition ; decreasing @xmath25 has the opposite effect .",
    "heuristically , increasing @xmath25 effectively increases the stiffness of the double stranded dna , which is indeed known to broaden the transition @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath212 plays no special role in this respect .",
    "in contrast , a recent model @xcite which adds angular degrees of freedom to the poland - scheraga helix - coil model singles out the value @xmath212 as special and predicts a broadening of the transition for @xmath24 as well as @xmath23 .    ,",
    "@xmath213 , and @xmath214 ( left to right , temperature increment @xmath206 ) . ]    finally , we have also tested the performance of the transfer matrix algorithm on larger sequences , up to about @xmath215 .",
    "the algorithm was written in matlab and run on a 2.8 ghz pc , and computed times follow the line @xmath216 , with @xmath217 in seconds .",
    "comparison with @xcite shows that our algorithm performs as fast as the fastest available helix - coil algorithm .      in this section ,",
    "we illustrate the solution of the fixed linking number ensemble , and compare it to the fixed torque ensemble as well as the helix - coil sidd model @xcite , by showing example results for the c - myc sequence ( @xmath218 ) , available as example 3 on the websidd server @xcite .",
    "again , the qualitative conclusions drawn from this example are valid in general . following the outline of section [ sec : lk_num ] ,",
    "we start by showing in figure [ fig:7 ] a plot of @xmath219 for different values of the superhelical density @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , corresponding to values @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 .",
    "as @xmath135 goes to @xmath179 , the graph becomes constant for @xmath25 smaller than a critical value corresponding to the torque induced melting transition observed in the homogeneous model @xcite . for non - zero @xmath135",
    "the graph has a maximum at some value @xmath228 and this is the value we need for constructing the integration contour and for comparing the linking number and torque ensembles .",
    "we emphasize here that obtaining a very precise value of the location of the maximum is not necessary . indeed , the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) can be carried out along any line parallel to the imaginary axis . taking a line at or close to the maximum",
    "will simply ensure that the function to be integrated falls off very quickly along this line .     for @xmath229 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 ( top to bottom ) at @xmath181 .",
    "]    next we turn our attention to the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , @xmath230 figure [ fig:8 ] shows the absolute value of @xmath231 in a neighborhood of @xmath155 for a superhelical density @xmath232 and temperature @xmath181 . for this value of @xmath135 and @xmath127 ,",
    "the critical point is given by @xmath233 .",
    "as expected , the function decays to @xmath179 rapidly , but clearly not rapidly enough to apply a stationary phase approximation ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:9 ] shows the real part of @xmath231 , which is the function to be integrated to obtain the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) . both figure [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ]",
    "are generated by interpolating between a number of computed data points .",
    "due to the oscillations , it is important to compute enough data points , we used an interval of @xmath235 .",
    "one way to determine the accuracy of the numerical approximation is to check if the expectation value of the superhelical density matches the imposed value .",
    "we find @xmath236 which compares well with the exact value of @xmath222 .",
    "similarly , we can check how well the value @xmath150 was determined by computing the expected helical density in the fixed torque ensemble with torque @xmath150 , and find a value of @xmath237 .",
    "this is the value obtained by differentiating the splines approximation of figure [ fig:7 ] , and due to the broad maximum , better accuracy should not be expected .",
    "however , it is clear from the fast decay of the function @xmath238 in figure [ fig:8 ] , that this value of @xmath150 is accurate enough for computing expectation values in the linking number ensemble .",
    "if a more accurate value is desired , such as in figure [ fig:11 ] below , we can start from this approximate @xmath150 , and fine tune it by computing @xmath239 for some values @xmath240 until the correct linking number is found .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) ) at @xmath232 ( @xmath241 ) and @xmath181 ( @xmath167-interval @xmath242 ) . ]",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) ) at @xmath232 ( @xmath241 ) and @xmath181 ( @xmath167-interval @xmath242 ) . ]    to visualize how the linking number constraint affects the melting behavior of a sequence by introducing an effective long range base pair coupling in the partition function , we follow benham and bi @xcite , and compare the original c - myc sequence to a modified sequence which differs from the c - myc sequence in a tiny fragment only .",
    "more precisely , we compute the opening probability for the c - myc sequence at fixed linking number ( @xmath232 ) ( figure [ fig:10 ] , top panel ) , then remove from the sequence a small @xmath243 bp segment in the center of the main untwisted region ( sequence positions 781  824 ) , and compute the opening probability for this modified sequence at the same superhelical density ( figure [ fig:10 ] , bottom panel ) .    for the c - myc sequence",
    ", we find that there are two locations that are preferentially opened , a first , large one , between positions @xmath244 , and a second , smaller one , between position @xmath245 , with much higher opening probability for the largest region . in agreement with the sidd - model @xcite",
    "we see that a small modification of the sequence is sufficient to shift the main opening activity to the second region .     and fixed superhelical density @xmath232 for the c - myc sequence ( @xmath218 ) ( top ) and the modified c - myc sequence ( @xmath246 ) ( bottom ) . ]    in figure [ fig:11 ]",
    ", we show the corresponding opening probabilities in the fixed torque ensemble . for a fair comparison , we adjusted the torque values for both sequences separately to return a superhelical density expectation value @xmath232 with high accuracy .",
    "as a final check that we are comparing both ensembles with the right parameters , we compute the total fraction of open base pairs @xmath247 , and find that it is equal to @xmath248 for both top panels of figure [ fig:10 ] and [ fig:11 ] , and equal to @xmath249 for both bottom panels .    the main qualitative difference that can be observed between both ensembles is that the effect of removing the small segment is much more localized in the torque ensemble , and the first region is still dominant .",
    "if we consider a base pair to be open if @xmath250 , like in constructing the melting maps in section [ sec : res_tq ] , we see that in the linking number ensemble the open region shifts from the left to the right upon modifying the sequence , while in the torque ensemble , the open region disappears .     in fixed torque ensemble for the c - myc sequence ( @xmath218 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 ) ( top ) and the modified c - myc sequence ( @xmath246 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 ) ( bottom ) .",
    "in this paper we have connected the particle - lattice helicoidal peyrard - bishop model to more familiar ising - type models for inhomogeneous dna melting . in the simplest setting of a fixed external torque",
    ", the model has the same melting behavior as the poland - scheraga helix - coil model . since the numerical integrations needed to compute the profiles in the particle - lattice model can be carried out using a limited number of discretization points , and since the interactions are only nearest - neighbor , we have obtained a new method to compute melting profiles which is both very simple to implement and very efficient to execute , and which is therefore highly attractive to analyze very long , or even whole genome sequences .",
    "furthermore we have shown that also the more complicated setting of a fixed linking number can be treated and that the results are in agreement with benham s sidd model .",
    "the algorithm is again simple to implement and consists of numerically integrating the fixed torque results over a small range of complex torque values .",
    "some of the points raised here such as the inequivalence of ensembles are worthwhile of investigating mathematically more rigorous in the setting of the homogeneous helicoidal peyrard - bishop model to see if they persist in the thermodynamic limit .    the equivalence between nearest - neighbor lattice models with continuous degrees of freedom on the one hand , and ising models with loop entropy weights or long - range interaction on the other hand , raises more fundamental questions as well . a better understanding of this equivalence will presumably lead to a better understanding of nonlinear phenomena in one - dimensional systems .",
