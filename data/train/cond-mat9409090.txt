    "interest in low - dimensional magnetic systems has been great in recent years , partly because of the widespread belief that magnetism plays a key role in high - temperature superconductivity , but also because of the successful application of field - theoretic methods to these systems , in particular to spin chains .",
    "indeed , a mapping from the spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg chain with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) coupling to the @xmath3 sigma model has led haldane to conjecture@xcite that integer spin chains should exhibit a gap to a triplet of excited states , whereas half - integer spin chains should not .",
    "this conjecture has later been confirmed by numerical calculations.@xcite such a mapping may be termed _",
    "semi - classical _ , since it is constructed by introducing a local field characterizing the order expected in the classical ground state and by taking into account fluctuations of the spin variables around this local order . in the case of the simple af chain ,",
    "a collinear order exists in the classical ground state and the local field introduced is a unit vector @xmath4 representing the staggered magnetization .",
    "the long wavelength effective action obtained for this field is that of the @xmath3 sigma model , with lagrangian density @xmath5 the coupling @xmath6 and the velocity @xmath7 are related to the spin @xmath2 , the af coupling @xmath8 and the lattice spacing : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to this action",
    "one must add a topological term @xmath11 for half - integer spin ( cf .",
    "an extension of this mapping to dimensions higher than one has been obtained by many authors , with the difference that no topological term arises , hence no distinction between half - integral and integral spin .",
    "dombre and read@xcite have conducted a similar analysis for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice .",
    "the essential difference here is the presence of frustration , leading to a classical ground state characterized by a @xmath12 order .",
    "the local order must then be specified by a rotation matrix instead of a unit vector and the order parameter is thus an element of @xmath0 .",
    "the long - wavelength action found in this case is the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model , with lagrangian density @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a position- and time - dependent rotation matrix and @xmath15 is the constant diagonal matrix @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "again , the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend on the spin @xmath2 , the lattice spacing @xmath17 and the af couplings @xmath8 . at zero temperature and in dimension two",
    ", this model has an ordered phase for @xmath18 and a disordered phase otherwise .",
    "since @xmath19 , the spin-@xmath20 case is the closest to the disordered phase .",
    "however , it is now widely believed@xcite that the ground state of the spin-@xmath20 antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice has long range order and consequently the disordered phase of the @xmath0 model is not physically realized to two - dimensional antiferromagnets , at least at half - filling ( one spin per site ) .    in this work",
    "we will argue that this disordered phase of the @xmath0 sigma model could be realized in a frustrated antiferromagnetic chain , with hamiltonian @xmath21 introducing a next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) coupling @xmath22 modifies the classical ground state if @xmath23 : the spins still lie on a common plane , but instead of being collinear ( as in the nel state ) , they are arranged in a canted configuration ( see fig .  [ groundfig ] ) in which each spin makes an angle @xmath24 with its predecessor , given by @xmath25 in the special case @xmath26 , the classical order is quite similar to that of the triangular lattice , with its @xmath12 angle from site to site and its periodicity of three sites .",
    "for spin-@xmath20 this particular case constitutes the majumdar - gosh model , whose ground state is exactly known.@xcite for a generic value of @xmath27 the classical order is incommensurable , with infinite periodicity .",
    "the spin-1 case has been studied previously using various methods : exact diagonalizations@xcite , approximate mappings to field theories involving fermions@xcite or bosons@xcite , among others .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we explain how to obtain the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model as the continuum limit of the model defined in eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) . in sec .",
    "iii we argue that the disordered phase of this model is characterized by a singlet ground state with a gap to _ two _ degenerate triplets of excited states .",
    "hence this model can not adequately represent the half - integer nnn chain , but may be correct for integer spin . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss our results with the help of exact diagonalization results and discuss the apparent lack of distinction between integer and half - integer spin in this model .",
    "in this section we argue that the long wavelength , continuum theory describing the frustrated antiferromagnetic chain is specified by the lagrangian density of eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) , with the notation explained thereafter .    the lagrangian description of spin dynamics , as used in path integrals , requires the introduction of spin coherent states . the unfamiliar reader is referred to fradkin s text@xcite or to manousakis review@xcite .",
    "each quantum spin @xmath28 is described by a fluctuating unit vector @xmath29 and the action associated to a spin hamiltonian @xmath30 is @xmath31 wherein @xmath28 is replaced by @xmath32 in the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath33 is the vector potential of a magnetic monopole of flux @xmath34 .",
    "thus , given a closed curve @xmath35 on the unit sphere , the integral @xmath36 equals the area of the sphere enclosed by the curve , modulo @xmath34 .    we shall use a description of each spin @xmath28 in terms of a slowly varying @xmath0 order parameter @xmath37 and a local magnetization vector @xmath38 :    [ rep ] @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the orientation of the spin @xmath41 in a classical ground state taken as reference , in which all spins lie on the plane defined by two mutually orthogonal unit vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; @xmath24 is the pitch of this ground state , as given in eq .",
    "( [ pitch ] ) ; finally , @xmath17 is the lattice spacing : it is assumed that the spin configurations that contribute significantly to the path integral are locally close to the classical ground state , and the approximation that the deviation @xmath44 is small will be controlled at the same time as the continuum approximation .",
    "some comments are in order concerning this representation .",
    "if @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , the periodicity is 3 and the relation ( [ rep ] ) may be considered as a",
    "_ bona fide _ change of variables if we group the spins in sets of three and assume that the fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 do not vary within such sets .",
    "we check that the number of degrees of freedom match : @xmath49 per set of three spins .",
    "however , it is more convenient to assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 vary slowly from site to site , in which case the representation ( [ rep ] ) may not be regarded as a change of variables , but simply as long wavelength description of the fluctuations around the classical ground state ; then we need not restrict ourselves to the case @xmath45 .",
    "the next step is to substitute the representation ( [ rep ] ) into the action ( [ action1 ] ) and to taylor expand when needed in order to get a continuum action in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 only .",
    "we will treat the kinetic term first , and then the hamiltonian . for the sake of convenience",
    ", we will assume a periodicity of @xmath50 spins in the classical ground state .",
    "the case @xmath51 ( or @xmath45 ) is the simplest , leading to a calculation almost identical to that of ref .  .",
    "the next simplest is @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , and so on .",
    "an explicit calculation of the kinetic term is not needed here , since it would be almost identical to that of ref .",
    ", to which the reader is referred .",
    "the difference here lies in the number of reference vectors @xmath54 , which is @xmath50 instead of 3 .",
    "the kinetic part of the lagrangian density is then @xmath55 with the definitions    @xmath56    wherein the indices in spin space correspond to the axes defined by @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 means an average over @xmath50 contiguous sites .    in order to write down the continuum limit of the hamiltonian @xmath30",
    ", we need to calculate the interaction @xmath59 of a spin @xmath41 with its four neighbors and then average the result over the @xmath50 spins @xmath41 of the period .",
    "specifically , the hamiltonian density is @xmath60 the contribution @xmath59 may be written as follows : @xmath61 where the spin @xmath62 stands in fact for its expression in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( eq .  ( [ rep ] ) ) and where the derivatives act on these same fields .",
    "we will carry the expansion to second order only , enough to yield a non trivial lagrangian .",
    "we shall also use a taylor expanded version of the representation ( [ rep ] ) : @xmath63{\\bf n}^c_k )    \\nonumber\\\\ + sa^2 r({\\bf n}^c_k)\\left[{\\textstyle\\frac32}({\\bf n}^c_k\\cdot{\\bf l})^2- { \\textstyle\\frac12}{\\bf l}^2\\right ] -sa^2r({\\bf l})[{\\bf n}^c_k\\cdot{\\bf l } ] + { \\cal o}(a^3)~~.\\ ] ]    we may then write the hamiltonian density as an expansion in powers of @xmath17 : @xmath64 @xmath65 is a constant , independent of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath66 vanishes for the following reasons : part of it depends on @xmath48 , but it is proportional to @xmath67 , which is zero .",
    "another part depends on @xmath47 , and is given by @xmath68 but one easily calculates that @xmath69 after substituting and using the relation ( [ pitch ] ) , we find out that the expression ( [ h1a ] ) vanishes .",

    "( [ dr ] ) .",
    "the full lagrangian density is then @xmath75 .",

    "the parameter @xmath85 ranges from 0 ( @xmath86 ) to 1 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the characteristic speed @xmath81 diverges as @xmath88 , whereas the coupling constant @xmath80 diverges as @xmath89 , the collinear phase boundary . in all cases ,",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) does not possess lorentz invariance , which makes it a qualitatively distinct theory from the versions of the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model studied in the context of classical critical phenomena@xcite .",
    "its symmetries comprise global left rotations @xmath90 with @xmath91 and global right rotations @xmath92 with @xmath93 ( i.e. @xmath94 commuting with @xmath15 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "the first of these reflects invariance under rotations in spin space , whereas the other will have consequences on the spectrum of the theory : a degeneracy of the excitation branches .",
    "it is important to stress here that in going from the discrete heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) to the continuum lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) we have assumed that smooth configurations dominate the path integral .",
    "there seems to be no distinction between integer and half - integer spins within this mapping . in particular",
    ", there is no topological term of the type arising in the collinear antiferromagnetic chain ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "in fact , none could exist , since the relevant homotopy group is trivial : @xmath96 . however , there are qualitative differences between integer and half - integer spin in this system .",
    "the question as to why they do not appear explicitly in the field theory will be discussed in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss the spectrum of the model defined in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) , in particular regarding the gap to excited states and the degeneracy of the excitation branches . to this end",
    "it is preferable to rewrite the lagrangian  ( [ lag ] ) in terms of two orthonormal vectors @xmath97 and @xmath98 specifying the rotation matrix @xmath47 . defining @xmath99 ,",

    ". this may be done by introducing three lagrange parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and by adding the following constraint term to the lagrangian : @xmath113    since this model is defined in one spatial dimension , the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem applies and the global @xmath0 symmetry is not broken .",
    "if we extended the model to dimensions greater than one , a broken symmetry phase could be realized , for @xmath6 below some critical value . in such a phase ,",
    "three goldstone modes would appear , corresponding to the three parameters of the broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "these three goldstone modes would have a linear dispersion relation , two of them with speed @xmath105 and a third with speed @xmath114 . the most elegant way to see",
    "this is to go back to the form ( [ lag ] ) of the lagrangian and to substitute , in the small oscillation approximation , @xmath115 , keeping the terms of order @xmath116 only .",
    "since the field @xmath117 is unconstrained , the dispersion relations are easily read off . in the case of an antiferromagnet on a triangular or hexagonal lattice ( @xmath83 ) ,",
    "the two speeds are @xmath105 and @xmath118 .",
    "this may also be observed within spin - wave theory , since it is a feature of the ordered phase .",
    "however , we are interested here in the disordered phase of the model , which we shall study within the large-@xmath50 approach ( here @xmath50 is the number of components of the vectors @xmath119 , normally 3 ) . in the imaginary - time formalism ,",
    "the partition function of the model is @xmath120[d{\\bf e}_2][d\\sigma_{ab } ] \\exp -\\int dxd\\tau~{\\cal l}_e\\ ] ] with the euclidian lagrangian density @xmath121 -g\\gamma({\\bf e}_1\\cdot\\partial_\\tau{\\bf e}_2)^2 + \\left[(\\partial_x{\\bf e}_1)^2 + ( \\partial_x{\\bf e}_2)^2\\right]\\right\\ } + \\sigma_{ab}({\\bf e}_a\\cdot{\\bf e}_b-{1\\over g}\\delta_{ab})\\ ] ] where we have rescaled @xmath119 by a factor @xmath122 in order to recover the standard normalization for the kinetic term .",
    "the characteristic speed @xmath105 has been set to unity in order to lighten the notation ; it may be restored by dimensional analysis .",
    "we will also use a hubbard - stratonovich decomposition of the quartic term : @xmath123\\exp-\\int dxd\\tau~\\left\\ { \\textstyle\\frac12\\phi^2   -\\sqrt{g\\gamma}\\phi({\\bf e}_1\\cdot\\partial_\\tau{\\bf e}_2\\right\\})\\ ] ]    we then proceed to find the large-@xmath50 saddle point .",
    "in other words , we assume that the auxiliary fields @xmath124 and @xmath125 take a constant value , which is determined by extremizing the effective potential obtained by integrating the fields @xmath119 . this exercise is better done in fourier space , in which the euclidian action with constant auxiliary fields may be written as    [ lag2 ] @xmath126\\ ] ] @xmath127",
    "the effective potential is then @xmath128 where we assume the system to be limited by a box of side @xmath129 .    in terms of the variables @xmath130",
    "the saddle - point equations are the following :    @xmath131    the immediate solution to these equations is @xmath132 and @xmath133 , determined by the simpler equation @xmath134 it can be shown explicitly@xcite that the solution @xmath132 is the only acceptable one in this case .",
    "( [ gapeq ] ) coincides with the saddle - point equation for the @xmath3 nonlinear sigma model , whose solution is @xmath135 wherein @xmath136 is a momentum cutoff . the fields @xmath110 and @xmath111 must therefore be shifted by the constant @xmath137 in order to fluctuate about zero .",
    "then @xmath137 multiplies @xmath138 and @xmath139 in the large-@xmath50 effective action ; thus , it has the interpretation of a quantum fluctuation - induced mass squared for the fields @xmath119 .",
    "the excitations of these fields are then triplets with energy gap @xmath140 . after restoring the characteristic speed @xmath105 , and the dependence on @xmath85 ,",
    "this becomes @xmath141 of course , this result neglects @xmath1 corrections .",
    "as @xmath89 ( the collinear point ) the gap goes to zero .",
    "this signals a continuous phase transition , beyond which a different description of the system is needed , for instance in terms of the @xmath3 sigma model . from @xmath142 up to @xmath143 , which corresponds to @xmath86 , the gap increases and becomes eventually proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the main feature of the excitations of this model is the degeneracy of the triplets .",
    "this ultimately comes from the @xmath144 symmetry existing between the vectors @xmath145 and @xmath98 , which may be mixed with each other without affecting the action .",
    "it is then not surprising if this degeneracy survives the large-@xmath50 approximation .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 corrections to the dispersion of the excitations can in principle be calculated , like they are in the @xmath3 sigma model ( see , for instance , polyakov s text@xcite ) .",
    "the quantity of interest is then the self - energy of the fields @xmath119 . in general , this is a matrix @xmath146 , which may be calculated diagrammatically with the help of the vertices shown in fig .",
    "[ vertices ] and of the propagators for the auxiliary fields @xmath125 and @xmath124 . the latter scale as @xmath1",
    "since they are inverse polarization operators , and the order in @xmath1 is simply determined by the number of auxiliary field internal lines .",
    "however , the propagators for @xmath110 and @xmath111 are identical , since the large-@xmath50 propagators of @xmath145 and @xmath98 are the same .",
    "moreover , the structure of the vertices of fig .  [ vertices ] makes it impossible for a non - diagonal self - energy @xmath147 to arise : even though the auxiliary fields @xmath148 and @xmath124 may change a @xmath97 quanta into a @xmath98 quanta , the number of such vertices must be even , without tadpoles .",
    "the net result is that no self - energy diagram exists in which an entering @xmath145 line is turned into an exiting @xmath98 line , and consequently @xmath149 .",

    "[ self ] . at all orders in @xmath1",
    "the two self - energies @xmath150 and @xmath151 are identical and therefore the degeneracy of the excitations branches seems a exact feature of the model .",
    "in sec  ii we argued that the frustrated af spin chain may be described , in the continuum limit , by the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model defined by the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) . in sec  iii , we argued that the main feature of the spectrum of this continuum model is a doubly degenerate triplet of spin-1 excitations , separated from the singlet ground - state by a gap .",
    "however , this conclusion is incompatible with what is known of the spectrum of the frustrated spin-@xmath20 chain .",
    "the lieb - schultz - mattis ( lsm ) theorem@xcite states that a spin-@xmath20 chain has either no gap or degenerate ground states ( corresponding to spontaneously broken parity ) .",
    "more recently , it has been shown@xcite that this theorem applies to half - integer spin chains in general . in the special case",
    "@xmath45 the exact ground state of the spin-@xmath20 chain obtained by majumdar and gosh@xcite is two - fold degenerate .",
    "this is compatible with the lsm theorem , but in contradiction with the field theory .",
    "thus , the latter does not correctly describe frustrated half - integer spin chains .    before throwing the @xmath0 model away",
    ", one should see if it describes the long wavelength behavior of integer spin chains .",
    "exact results for the spin-1 chain are lacking and thus we are reduced to numerical study of finite systems .",
    "quantum monte - carlo studies of frustrated spin systems are quite difficult because of a sign problem , therefore we limited ourselves to numerical diagonalizations of small chains ( up to 14 sites ) .",
    "we used various methods , of which the most practical turned out to be a variant of the lanczos method@xcite applied to subspaces of fixed momentum .",
    "diagonalizations of spin-@xmath20 chains with up to 22 sites have also been performed , for the sake of comparison .",
    "it turns out that the spectra of spin-1 and spin-@xmath20 chains of small lengths are qualitatively different .",
    "the ground state of the spin-1 chains is non - degenerate , with a gap to a doubly degenerate triplet of spin-1 states , exactly as in the field theory .",

    "consequently , this minimum also occurs at @xmath157 , which is distinct from @xmath154 except at the ferromagnetic ( @xmath158 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath159 ) points .",
    "the existence of these minima away from the parity - invariant points should not surprise us .",

    "the effect of quantum fluctuations is to produce a singlet ground state and to raise the minima of the goldstone branches .",
    "we expect that the positions of these minima be approximately the same as the classical ordering wave - vectors @xmath154 and @xmath157 , although we have no way to prove that they coincide exactly with these values .",
    "the @xmath0 field theory effectively describes low - energy excitations about the minima of these excitation branches , and the degeneracy is essentially linked to the fact that the classical ordering wavevectors @xmath154 and @xmath157 are inequivalent .",
    "this feature of the excitation spectrum supports the view that the @xmath0 field theory describes the long wavelength behavior of the frustrated spin-1 chain .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in a chain of length @xmath50 , there is critical value @xmath161 of the ratio @xmath162 , above which the minimum in the triplet dispersion relation occurs at @xmath159 .",
    "this critical value depends on the length of the chain .",
    "if one trusts the heuristic mapping of section ii , it should be equal to @xmath163 when @xmath164 . for finite chains it is closer to @xmath165 , but it is conceivable that it reaches the predicted value as @xmath50 grows .",
    "figure  [ spectre3 ] shows the evolution of @xmath166 for small sizes , as well as the value of the mass gap @xmath167 .",
    "the question remains as to why this semi - classical treatment fails in the half - integer spin case .",
    "in other words , where in the argument of sec .",
    "ii should the distinction between integer and half - integer spin come into play ?",
    "the answer may lie in our neglect of configurations with discontinuities .",
    "this has already been pointed out in ref .   in relation with the kinetic term . an easier way to see",
    "this is to consider the limit @xmath168 . in that limit",
    "one may reconsider the problem and view the system as a pair of interwoven , antiferromagnetic chains with a small interchain interaction @xmath8 .",
    "each chain could be semi - classically described by the usual @xmath3 nonlinear sigma model , with the lagrangian density ( [ nls ] ) , plus a topological term @xmath169 expressed as @xmath170 since the effective lattice spacing for each chain is now @xmath171 , the characteristic velocity would be @xmath172 , while the coupling constant is still @xmath10 .",
    "one checks that this agrees perfectly with the @xmath88 limit of eq .",
    "( [ params ] ) .",
    "thus , as @xmath173 decreases , the two unit vectors @xmath145 and @xmath98 of the @xmath0 model become the fields of two weakly coupled @xmath3 sigma models , with the correct values of @xmath105 and @xmath6 .",
    "the interaction @xmath174 between the two chains may be easily expressed in terms of @xmath145 and @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , recall that in taking the continuum limit of a single af chain , one uses the decomposition @xmath175 $ ] , where @xmath48 is the local magnetization and @xmath171 is the effective lattice spacing for each chain . neglecting derivatives ,",
    "the interaction lagrangian may be written as @xmath176 the elimination of @xmath177 and @xmath178 is done by substituting the equation of motion@xcite @xmath179 the interaction lagrangian then becomes @xmath180 if we assume that the two vectors @xmath145 and @xmath98 are identically orthogonal , as the classical ground state suggests if @xmath85 is small , then the above interaction exactly agrees with eq .",
    "( [ lagvec ] ) and the @xmath88 limit of @xmath104 as given in eq .",
    "( [ params ] ) . moreover , the topological terms @xmath181 $ ] and @xmath182 $ ] cancel each other if @xmath145 is identically orthogonal to @xmath98 .",
    "this is particularly easy to understand if the configuration @xmath145 belongs to the homotopy class of the identity , since the orthogonality constraint then effectively makes @xmath98 a mapping from the sphere @xmath183 to the circle @xmath184 and @xmath185 . in general , the two topological terms cancel simply because of the fact that two orthogonal unit vectors specify a rotation and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , if we assume that @xmath186 in the small @xmath85 limit , the lagrangian ( [ lagvec ] ) is recovered with exactly the same parameters , since the topological terms are absent .    however , the orthogonality @xmath186 is not strict , but only favored energetically .",
    "a local deviation from this orthogonality gives back their full importance to the topological terms and causes a distinction between integer and half - integer spins .",
    "such a distinction does not occur in the @xmath0 formulation of the problem since the orthogonality is then ` built - in ' . in that formulation ,",
    "a local deviation from orthogonality corresponds to a discontinuity in the order parameter , which was not allowed from the start .",
    "finally , let us point out that the above remarks concerning parity - breaking ordering wavevectors in frustrated antiferromagnets and their consequences on the excitation spectrum may apply to other systems , such as the nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice . in this case",
    "it is believed that the ground state has long - range order .",
    "however , it is conceivable that the introduction of vacancies destroys this order without affecting the applicability of the @xmath0 theory : the effect of the vacancies would then be to increase the value of the effective coupling constant @xmath6 beyond the critical value @xmath187 . a priori",
