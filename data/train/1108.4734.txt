    "tremendous progress has been made in recent years in the quest to reveal the structure of the nucleon at its deepest levels .",
    "traditionally deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons has been the primary tool used to study nucleon structure at large values of the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath3 , where the nucleon s quark and gluon ( or parton ) constituents can be cleanly resolved . here the theoretical tools are well developed , and the nucleon s structure can be conveniently parametrized in terms of universal longitudinal momentum distribution functions of individual quarks and gluons .",
    "global analyses of dis and other hard processes have been highly successful in correlating data over a wide range of kinematics , producing fits of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) to next - to - leading order ( in the strong coupling parameter @xmath4 ) accuracy and beyond @xcite .",
    "while the perturbative domain of large @xmath3 and small parton momentum fraction @xmath5 has received considerable attention both experimentally and theoretically , the region of large @xmath5 and low @xmath3 ( @xmath6  gev@xmath7 ) , where nonperturbative effects play a greater role , has been relatively poorly explored .",
    "this is perhaps not too surprising given the difficulty in reliably computing the various corrections that are needed to describe data in this region .",
    "examples of nonperturbative effects that are relevant here include target mass corrections ( tmcs ) associated with finite values of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the nucleon mass , higher twist terms arising from long - range nonperturbative multi - parton correlations , and nuclear corrections in experiments involving deuterium or heavier nuclei , which are important at large @xmath5 for any @xmath3 .",
    "the large-@xmath5 region has been particularly difficult to access experimentally , especially in high - energy colliders , due to the rapidly falling cross sections as @xmath10 .",
    "the most extensive data set available that covers this region has been from experiments at slac @xcite .",
    "more recently , progress on this front has been made with dis structure function measurements at jefferson lab , utilizing the high luminosities and duty factors available with the cebaf accelerator .",
    "indeed , an impressive body of very high - precision data has now been accumulated over the last decade on various structure functions , including accurate longitudinal ",
    "transverse separations needed for model - independent determinations of the @xmath1 and @xmath11 structure functions of protons and nuclei @xcite .",
    "future plans at the energy upgraded jefferson lab involve extending the dis measurements to even larger @xmath5 ( @xmath12 ) with planned experiments @xcite to measure the ratio of @xmath13 to @xmath14 quark distributions , as well as search for effects such as charge symmetry violation in pdfs and tests of the standard model in parity - violating dis asymmetries .",
    "the new data have the potential to provide strong constraints on pdfs at large @xmath5 , where currently uncertainties remain significant .",
    "several recent analyses @xcite have in fact attempted to utilize data at low values of @xmath3 and invariant final state hadron masses @xmath15 .",
    "stable fits of leading twist pdfs could be obtained @xcite for @xmath16 down to @xmath17  gev and @xmath18  gev@xmath7 , as long as tmc and higher twist corrections were accounted for .",
    "aside from its intrinsic value , better knowledge of pdfs at large @xmath5 may also be important for searches of new physics signals in collider experiments such as at the tevatron or the lhc at large rapidities or for heavy mass particles @xcite , as well as at more central rapidities where uncertainties in large-@xmath5 pdfs at low @xmath3 can , through @xmath3 evolution , affect cross sections at small @xmath5 and large @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the increased kinematic reach of the future high - precision dis measurements calls for a careful evaluation of the relevant nonperturbative corrections in order to unambiguously extract information on leading twist pdfs or new physics signals .",
    "the effects that are most amenable to direct computation , in principle , are the tmcs . as discussed by nachtmann @xcite , these effects are in fact associated with leading twist operators ( hence contain no additional information on the nonperturbative parton correlations ) , even though they give rise to @xmath19 corrections , where @xmath20 is the energy transfer .",
    "nachtmann further showed that one could generalize the standard operator product expansion ( ope ) of structure function moments to finite @xmath3 such that only operators of a specific twist would appear at a given order in @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting target mass corrected structure functions can then be derived through an inverse mellin transformation , as shown by georgi and politzer @xcite ( for a review of tmcs in the ope approach see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "later an alternative formulation in terms of collinear factorization ( cf ) was used by ellis , furmanski and petronzio @xcite to derive tmcs including the effects of off - shell partons and parton transverse motion . while the ope and cf formulations yield identical results for leading twist pdfs , they differ in the details of how the target mass corrections are manifested at finite @xmath3",
    ". other versions of tmcs were subsequently derived @xcite within the cf formalism using various assumptions about the intrinsic properties of partons and higher twist contributions , leading to rather large differences in some cases @xcite .",
    "some of the phenomenological implications of the different tmc prescriptions were discussed in refs .",

    "we also quantify the effects of perturbative nlo corrections on the @xmath26 ratio for the @xmath2 interference , about which nothing is known empirically , and of nuclear effects on the deuteron pv asymmetries .",

    ", additional effects not discussed here may need to be considered at large @xmath5 , principal among which are dynamical higher twist corrections associated with nonperturbative multi - parton correlations .",
    "these are very difficult to compute from first principles , and only rudimentary model estimates have been available to date",
    ". further insight into the relation between tmcs and higher twists may also shed light on the threshold problem , whereby the target mass corrected structure functions remain finite at the nucleon elastic scattering point , @xmath54 , as well as on the difference between the various tmc prescriptions .",
    "other corrections that may affect future analysis of large-@xmath5 data are threshold resummations , which involve formally summing , to all orders in @xmath4 , terms containing logarithms of @xmath229 that become large as @xmath10 .",
    "the results on the phenomenology of the target mass corrections contained in the present work should provide a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental investigations of these additional corrections .",
    "this analysis can also be extended to the spin - dependent sector @xcite , where the phenomenology of the collinear factorization framework in particular has not been as fully developed .",

    "<S> we perform a comprehensive analysis of target mass corrections ( tmcs ) to spin - averaged structure functions and asymmetries at next - to - leading order . </S>",

    "<S> we assess the impact of each of these on a number of observables , such as the neutron to proton @xmath1 structure function ratio , and parity - violating electron scattering asymmetries for protons and deuterons which are sensitive to @xmath2 interference effects . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections from higher order radiative and nuclear effects on the parity - violating deuteron asymmetry are also quantified . </S>"
