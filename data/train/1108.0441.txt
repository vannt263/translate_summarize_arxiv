    "oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe , and its form in different regions is thus of considerable astronomical importance .",
    "@xcite has recently reexamined the question of oxygen abundance as a function of density in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and finds that a large fraction of oxygen is unaccounted for at the higher densities which generally correspond to the molecular ism .",
    "models of gas - phase chemistry that do not treat the condensation of species as icy mantles on grains have predicted molecular oxygen ( ) to be abundant in well - shielded regions , with x ( ) = n()/n ( ) greater than 10@xmath10 , and thus the most abundant molecular species after  and , with predicted abundance exceeding that for water @xcite .",
    "the conditions that generally ( but not in every model ) maximize the abundance of  are low metal abundance ( consistent with depletion on grains ) , high densities , and sufficient time for oxygen chemistry to come into steady state .",
    "the gas - phase chemistry of  in dense clouds is relatively simple .",
    "formation of  is initiated by the reaction of atomic oxygen with h@xmath11 to form oh@xmath12 .",
    "h@xmath11 is produced by cosmic ray ionization of  and subsequent reaction of the resulting h@xmath13 with .",
    "the oh@xmath12 reacts with  to produce h@xmath14o@xmath12 , and by a second reaction , h@xmath15o@xmath12 .",
    "this ion dissociatively recombines with an electron , and the two channels of interest result in  and oh . the latter species can react with an oxygen atom to form .",
    "uncertainties in several of the key reaction rates have been reduced by laboratory measurements .",
    "the dissociative recombination of h@xmath15o@xmath12 has been measured using heavy - ion storage rings by @xcite , by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate for all three of these measurements is in reasonable agreement in magnitude and temperature dependence , with a large thermal rate coefficient @xmath16 @xmath6 3@xmath010@xmath3 @xmath17s@xmath18 at 50 k , and a temperature dependence @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "these results are consistent with the earlier results by @xcite obtained using a different technique .",
    "the branching ratio has been a subject of some uncertainty , the papers cited above all put the fraction of the recombinations that result in production of oh in the range 0.5 @xmath21 @xmath22(oh ) @xmath21 0.7 .",
    "thus , the effective rate coefficient for formation of oh by dissociative recombination of h@xmath15o@xmath12 at the temperature of dense molecular clouds is about 2@xmath010@xmath3 @xmath17s@xmath18 .    the rate at low temperatures of the reaction oh + o @xmath23 , the final step in the production of molecular oxygen , has been the subject of some controversy .",
    "theoretical calculations by @xcite were in moderately good agreement with the measurements for temperatures between 150 k and 500 k @xcite , and indicated the peak value of the rate coefficient to be @xmath24 = 5.5@xmath010@xmath25  at @xmath6 80 k , with a factor @xmath6 2 reduction at 10 k and 1000 k. measurements by @xcite sampled a range of temperatures , but these authors recommended use of a single value , @xmath24 = 3.5 @xmath26",
    "1.0@xmath010@xmath25  over the temperature range 39 k @xmath21 t @xmath21 142 k.    the calculations by @xcite suggested a rate that while only somewhat lower than that of @xcite at temperatures above 80 k , fell dramatically at lower temperatures .",
    "this opened the possibility that the  abundance in cooler clouds would be much lower than predicted by the above astrochemical models .",
    "however , more elaborate quantum mechanical calculations by @xcite showed a relatively weak temperature dependence , and a rate coefficient at 10 k that is 70 times larger than predicted by @xcite .",
    "recent quantum calculations by @xcite give rate coefficients that are a factor @xmath6 2 greater than the measurements of @xcite over their temperature range .",
    "the rate coefficients from these latest theoretical calculations do fall at temperatures below 30 k , but even at 10 k are @xmath5 3@xmath010@xmath25 , thus guaranteeing that the oh + o @xmath23  + h reaction will not be a low - temperature bottleneck for  production .",
    "the agreement between measured and theoretical calculations of the reaction rates suggests that the  production rate is reasonably well understood and confirms the purely gas - phase chemistry prediction of large x ( ) in all but possibly the coldest clouds .",
    "the expectation of a high abundance of  had previously been an impetus to include this species in calculations of gas - phase cooling @xcite , and it was found to be moderately important at intermediate densities , despite its weak magnetic dipole transitions .",
    "the major obstacle to studies of astronomical  is the strong absorption by this same species in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the large scale height of  compared to that of  means that even going to high altitude sites does not allow for observations of galactic  in the interstellar medium , where only the energy levels producing millimeter and submillimeter rotational transitions will likely be populated .",
    "although absorption observations of uv transitions are possible from space @xcite , clouds with sufficient column density to have detectable transitions of  are likely to have sufficiently large dust opacities that such observations will prove difficult .      a possibility that must be considered",
    "is that  is resident on dust grain surfaces .",
    "solid  has been searched for in interstellar clouds through its weak feature at 6.45 , with negative results @xcite .",
    "the most stringent abundance limits come from analysis of the solid   line profiles in low- and high - mass star - forming regions , which indicate solid  concentrations of less than 10% with respect to water ice @xcite . taking a typical water ice abundance of 10@xmath27 relative to ,",
    "this indicates solid /gas - phase  abundance ratios @xmath21 10@xmath10 within a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , at most 10% of elemental oxygen is locked up in  on grain surfaces .",
    "laboratory measurements show that solid  ice is only slightly less volatile than co ice with a binding energy of @xmath4 900 k , and thermally evaporates at 1618 k under typical interstellar conditions @xcite .",
    "if trapped in water ice , a small fraction of  can desorb at higher temperatures together with h@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "once on the grains , solid  is chemically active .",
    "a number of recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that  is rapidly hydrogenated by atomic h to form oh , h@xmath14o@xmath14 and h@xmath14o in ices , even at temperatures as low as 12 k @xcite .",
    "some gas - phase  can also be produced by photodesorption of h@xmath14o ice at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "the nondetection of solid  on grain surfaces is thus reasonable , and overall , the amount of oxygen on dust grains is not a major contributor to the overall oxygen budget in dense interstellar clouds .",
    "several different techniques have been utilized in the search for interstellar . in general , these normalize the derived column density ( or upper limit thereto ) to that of standard tracer , generally an isotopologue of carbon monoxide , from which the molecular hydrogen column density can be derived .",

    "given that the integrated intensities represent 8.5 @xmath28 , 22 @xmath28 , and 5 @xmath28 statistical features , there is little doubt that we have detected emission lines at the frequencies of each of the three  transitions that we have observed at the  peak 1 position .",

    "it is thus possible that , assuming all three lines are from , that the velocities are in agreement but we are seeing a statistical fluctuation in the fitting of the central velocity , most likely of the highest frequency line . alternatively the highest frequency line is sampling different gas .",
    "it seems improbable that a single molecular species other than  would have three spectral lines that match so closely with those from the species of interest .",
    "it is more plausible that the three spectral features in question are produced by three different `` interloper '' molecules , but in this case they additionally must have essentially identical line widths . while we can not rule out this possibility , it should be born in mind that in this region of orion , there is a wide variety of line shapes and widths due to the presence of multiple kinematic structures , so the species responsible would have all to share one specific set of line profiles and widths , further reducing the likelihood of this explanation .",
    "we have carried out a targeted analysis to assess likelihood that the observed spectral features are due to known molecular species . to do this , we first selected all molecular transitions found in the splatalogue catalog ( http://www.splatalogue.net ) falling within 5  of any of the three  lines observed , and having upper state energies less than 1000 k. there were two species ( ch@xmath15nh@xmath14 and ch@xmath15ocho ) having lines possibly interfering with the 487 ghz  line , three species ( ( ch@xmath15)@xmath14co , g - ch@xmath15ch@xmath14oh , and os@xmath7o ) close to the 774 ghz line , and 6 species ( ch@xmath15@xmath64ch@xmath14cn , g - ch@xmath15ch@xmath14oh , hcccho , ch@xmath15nh@xmath14 , g - c@xmath65h , and t - ch@xmath14chcho ) proximate to the 1121 ghz line .    for each species",
    ", we used the cassis program ( http://cassis.cesr.fr ) to simulate the emission spectrum for a 5  diameter source having line width between 2  and 4 , assuming lte with kinetic temperatures between 75 k and 150 k. in every case except one ( discussed below ) we found that we had sufficient frequency coverage to include undetected stronger lines located somewhere in the hifi spectrum . from the nondetections , we could set an upper limit to the column density of the species in question that was so low that all lines in the vicinity of the  transitions were significantly weaker than the observed  main beam brightness temperatures .",
    "the range of frequency covered in the hifi spectra ensured that transitions from states of comparable energy above the ground state to those producing possibly interfering lines were observed .",
    "thus , the gas temperature could not be adjusted in a manner to make the lines close to  relatively more intense than transitions of other carriers that were not detected .",
    "an example of this is ( ch@xmath15)@xmath14co ( acetone ) .",
    "this molecule has a transition only 12 mhz from the 773.8397 ghz  line , but also has a group of transitions near 774.4 ghz predicted to be an order of magnitude more intense than the line close to .",
    "we do not detect the higher frequency lines .",
    "the sensitivity of our data is such that the possible contribution to the  line is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the observed feature . in this manner",

    "39@xmath67 transition in the v = 1 state of the e species has rest frequency 487251.99996 mhz , compared to 487249.3755 mhz for the 3,1  3,2  transition .",
    "this is the only  transition with possible interference from this species .",
    "the upper level energy is 705 k. a number of narrow features in the full hifi spectrum are reproduced assuming that methyl formate is present emitting with a centroid velocity of 8  and a line width of 2.5 .",

    "the exact value of the column density depends on the location and characteristics of the source relative to the hifi beams , as well as the complex characteristics of emission from this species found by @xcite .",
    "if the emission is entirely from the mf4 source ( see figure [ orion_hifi_beams ] ) , the column density required would be considerably greater than found by @xcite so there may well be an extended emission component contributing . with these values defining the methyl formate emission",
    ", a significant portion of the 5.5  feature of the 487 ghz  line seen in figure [ o2_3trans ] could be due to this species .",
    "note that to reproduce the 11  feature , the ch@xmath15ocho would have to be at 12.6 , a value that is outside the range found by @xcite , seen in our _ herschel _ data , or found for any of the other species in this region of orion .",
    "the 5.5  feature seen in the 487 ghz  transition in the bottom panel of figure [ o2_3trans ] is at the velocity observed for most emission from the hot core region near kl .",
    "if all or part of this feature is due to , the fact that we see it only in the 487 ghz spectrum is not likely to be a result of excitation ; as discussed at length in  [ excitation ] , the  transitions are likely to be close to thermalization and the relative intensity of the 774 ghz line compared to that of the 487 ghz line will not be very different from unity .",
    "we are more likely seeing a result of the very different beam sizes and the offset between the hot core and  peak 1 .",
    "the angular offset is 27 and the 1/e beam radii are 26.3 , 16.6 , and 11.4 , at 487 , 774 , and 1121 ghz , respectively , yielding coupling factors to a point source 0.34 , 0.07 , and 0.003 , respectively .",
    "the finite size of the hot core will modify these results slightly , but it is still the case that when pointed at  peak 1 , the 487 ghz beam will couple moderately well to the hot core , but the two higher frequency beams will have very small coupling , explaining why the 5.5  feature is seen only in the lowest - frequency  line .",

    "an observed ratio of 0.5 , which requires a filled source temperature of 100 k demands a ratio 2.5 times larger in a small source , and thus a source temperature again @xmath6 30 k. a small source on boresight is consistent with a single temperature determined by the ratios of integrated intensities , but the source temperature is too low given the ease of excitation of  and the temperature of the center of the orion molecular cloud .",

    "we then find @xmath114    since @xmath115 = 11.4  and @xmath116 = 16.6 the correction factor for off - boresight pointing is always less than unity and decreases as the offset increases . to fit a given observed ratio",

    "we obtain for the v data @xmath28 = 0.0062 k , and for the h data @xmath28 = 0.0053 k , compared to theoretical values 0.0034 k and 0.0036 k , respectively .",
    "the ratio of observed to theoretical noise is 1.82 for v and 1.47 for h , with an average value of 1.65 .",
    "these results are impacted by the difficulty of accurately determining the rms from data due to the limited number of `` clean '' channels and time dependent baselines , but they do indicate that the system performance is reasonably close to theoretical .    the correctness of the noise bandwidth is confirmed by comparison of data smoothed to 4 mhz channel width ( 5 mhz noise bandwidth ) with the 2 mhz channel bandwidth ( 3 mhz noise bandwidth ) data ; the ratios for the different data sets have a mean value of 0.76 compared to 0.78 ( @xmath135 ) expected .",
    "the rms of the 4 mhz smoothed data is 0.0050 k for the v channel and 0.0036 k for the h channel , which average to a factor 1.61 times greater than the theoretical value .",
    "these results suggest that combining spectral channels reduces the noise in a manner close to that theoretically expected , and that the overall level of fluctuations is a factor @xmath4 1.6 greater than that expected strictly from the radiometer equation for integration times up to 2.7@xmath010@xmath37 s.        where in addition to symbols defined following equation [ coldens ] , we have the antenna effective area @xmath138 , the normalized antenna response pattern @xmath139 , and the normalized column density distribution , @xmath140 . for an extended uniform ( @xmath140 = 1 ) source filling the entire antenna pattern , the integral is the antenna solid angle , @xmath141 .",
    "if the source is uniform but extended only to fill the main beam , the integral is the main beam solid angle , @xmath142 . the main beam efficiency @xmath45 is defined as @xmath143 .",
    "we can still use equation [ intensity_source ] by considering it to refer to a source that covers at most only the main beam , and a main beam - corrected integrated antenna temperature , @xmath144 . from the antenna theorem , @xmath145 , for a given antenna .",
    "then we can rewrite equation [ intensity_source ] as      where the integral extends over the main beam . for a uniform source filling the main beam ,",
    "the integral is just @xmath142 and the integrated main beam temperature , @xmath147 is equal to the upper level column density multiplied by some constants ,      where we use the superscript _ src _ to indicate that this intensity is essentially a characteristic of the source itself rather than of the antenna being used for the observations . for a uniform small source located in the direction of the antenna boresight , @xmath140 = 1 within the extent of the source and = 0 outside .",
    "the integral , which is nonzero over a range that is much smaller than the main beam size so @xmath139 = 1 , is equal to the source solid angle , @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the observed intensity , denoted by the superscript _ obs _ is given by      the ratio of the observed intensity to that of the source is given by @xmath151 using the antenna theorem again , and defining the aperture efficiency in terms of the physical area of the antenna through @xmath152 we find @xmath153 a low frequency ( larger wavelength ) transition has a small value of @xmath154 , which can be thought of as arising from the small filling factor at the low frequency where the beam size is larger .",
    "to analyze our _ herschel _ observations of  in a reasonably simple manner , we consider a `` small '' source to be one that is smaller than the beam sizes at all three observing frequencies . assuming a constant ratio of aperture to main beam efficiency , which is quite good for _ herschel _ @xcite , @xmath154 for two different transitions , 2 and 1 , can be written as @xmath155 ^ 2 \\lp \\label{small_21}\\ ] ]                bergin , e.a . , melnick , g.j . ,",
