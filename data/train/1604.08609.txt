    "the theory of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) has a long history and it provides many important insights on natural dynamics influenced by external noise ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs.@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "one of such insights has emerged recently as a result of the conjecture @xcite that the theoretical essence of self - organized criticality @xcite may be the instanton - induced spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry that all sdes possess .",
    "further work in this direction led to the formulation of the approximation - free supersymmetric theory of stochastics ( sts ) ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .    from the mathematical point of view , the sts can be looked upon as a member of the cohomological or the witten - type topological field theories @xcite , as a generalization of the parisi - sourlas quantization @xcite from the langevin sdes to sdes of any form , and as the application of the concept of the generalized transfer operator of the dynamical systems theory @xcite to sdes .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the importance of sts is in providing the theoretical picture for `` dynamical long range order '' ( dlro ) , known under such names as turbulence , chaos , self - organization , pattern formation , self - organized criticality , complex dynamics _",
    "etc_. within the sts , drlo is the spontaneous breakdown of the topological or de rahm supersymmetry .",
    "the existence of this supersymmetry in all sdes is the algebraic representation of the phase - space continuity of the sde - defined dynamics @xcite .",
    "more specifically , two infinitely close points in the phase space will remain close during the sde - defined evolution at any configuration of the stochastic noise . from this perspective",
    ", the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry can be interpreted as the breakdown of this property in the limit of the infinitely long evolution , represented , of course , by the non - supersymmetric ground state . in other words , in the limit of the infinitely long evolution , two close points in the phase space may not be close anymore and the system may be said to exhibit the butterfly effect and for this reason identified as chaotic .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking picture of chaotic behavior generalizes its classical picture from dynamical systems theory to stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this picture provides a rigorous explanation ( via the goldstone theorem ) for the ubiquitous emergent long - range dynamical behavior in nature .",
    "besides the butterfly effect , this emergent long - range dynamics also includes 1/f noise or the long - term memory effect and the ritcher scale or the power - law statistics of sudden instantonic processes such as earthquakes , solar flares , neuroavalanches _",
    "the centerpiece of the sts is the stochastic evolution operator ( seo ) defined on the exterior algebra @xcite of the phase space , which is regarded as the hilbert space of the stochastic model .",
    "the seo describes the stochastically averaged sde - induced actions on the wavefunctions , the elements of this hilbert space .",
    "this stochastic averaging is possible since the hilbert space as well as the sde - induced actions on it are linear objects .",
    "in contrast , the operation of stochastic averaging on , say , sde - defined trajectories can not be defined in the general situation when the phase space is not a linear space . in this manner",
    ", the seo permits to study interplay between stochastic and dynamical properties of the systems .",
    "one of the important questions within the sts is the possible forms that the seo spectrum can take , as these encode the system s characteristics of being chaotic , _",
    "etc_. the key quantity here is the eigenvalue of the fastest growing eigenmode(s ) of seo , that must be identified as the ground state of the model . the problem of possible seo spectra has been recently solved partly in ref . @xcite by establishing a connection between the sts and the theory of kinematic dynamo ( kd , see,_e.g .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the kd is the weak - magnetic - field limit of the more general astrophysical phenomenon of magnetic dynamos , _",
    "i.e. _ , the amplification of a magnetic field by a moving conducting medium ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs . @xcite and refs . therein ) . with the help of this sts - kd connection and using previous numerical results from the kd theory @xcite",
    ", it has been established that seos with ground states with both real and complex eigenvalues are realizable .    the theory of kd deals , however , only with the non - supersymmetric eigenstates of the first and second degrees , the states that represent respectively the vector potential and the corresponding field tensor of the magnetic field . as such",
    ", the sts - kd connection can not elucidate on other properties of the seo .",
    "a few properties deduced previously analytically and from physical arguments remain to be proven or at least demonstrated numerically .",
    "such a numerical demonstration is the goal of the present paper .    here",
    ", we numerically study the seo of a stochastic abc model , one of the toy models used in kd theory to mimic chaotic flows @xcite .",
    "our results support the following previously deduced properties of the seo : _ ( i ) _ the spectra of the top and the zeroth degrees do not break topological supersymmetry , _ ( ii ) _ each de rahm cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate , and _ ( iii ) _ the overall spectra possess pseudo - time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that the seo with complementary degrees are isospectral  a property of seos for which we do not have yet a theoretical explanation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nutshell ] , we introduce the seo for a general - form sde with gaussian white noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the stochastic abc model , whereas the details of the numerical realization of its seo are given in the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : properties ] , the properties of the seo are discussed and exemplified by the numerical results for the stochastic abc flow model . sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the following general - form sde is of our interest : @xmath3 here and in the following the summation is assumed over the repeated indices ; @xmath4 is a point in the phase space , @xmath0 , which is assumed to be a topological manifold ; @xmath5 is a flow vector field on @xmath0 at @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is a set of vector fields on @xmath0 with @xmath8 being the parameter running over these vector fields ; @xmath9 is a set of the gaussian white noise variables .    for each configuration of the noise , eq.([sde ] )",
    "defines the family of trajectories in @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , this family of trajectories can be looked upon as a two - parameter family of diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 on itself @xcite , with the two parameters being the initial , @xmath10 , and the final , @xmath11 , time moments of temporal evolution , @xmath12 these diffeomorphisms induce actions or pullbacks on differential forms , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes the space of all differential forms of degree @xmath1 , or @xmath1-forms , @xmath15 , defined in eq.([k_forms ] ) via the contravariant antisymmetric tensor , @xmath16 , and the wedge or antisymmetric product of differentials , @xmath17 .",
    "eq.([tangentmap ] ) is known as the tangent map .",
    "the action in eq.([actions ] ) is the most natural construction from the mathematical point of view .",
    "it can be looked upon as the formal change of variables in a differential form induced by maps that are inverse to the forward maps in eq.([maps ] ) .",
    "the fact that these maps are inverse is reflected in the reversed order of @xmath18 and @xmath10 in eq.([actions ] ) as compared to that in eq.([maps ] ) .",
    "the reason for this seeming reversion of time is discussed in detail in sec.2.1 of ref.@xcite .    the entire exterior algebra of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the space of the differential forms of all degrees , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , is the hilbert space of the model .",
    "the top differential forms of maximal degree @xmath21 can be interpreted as the total probability distributions , whereas differential forms of lesser degrees can be looked upon , at least locally on @xmath0 , as the conditional probability distributions @xcite .",
    "the infinitesimal action of the sde - defined diffeomorphisms can be given via the stochastic flow equation ( sfe ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the lie of physical derivative along @xmath24 .",
    "the sfe follows immediately from the understanding of the lie derivative as of the infinitesimal pullback of the sde - defined flow .",
    "accordingly , the finite - time pullback is given as , @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes the operation of chronological ordering , which is necessary as in the general case @xmath23 s at different time moments of the evolution do not commute .",
    "the pullback is a linear operator on a linear hilbert space .",
    "thus , this operator can be averaged over the configurations of the noise .",
    "such stochastic averaging leads to the finite - time stochastic evolution operator ( seo ) , @xmath27 where brackets denote the stochastic averaging .",
    "for the white noise case only , the finite - time seo can be expressed via the ( infinitesimal ) seo , @xmath28 , in the following manner , @xmath29 so that the infinitesemal evolution of the wavefunctions is given by the following stochastic evolution equation , @xmath30 the explicit form of @xmath28 can be readily established using the following definition , @xmath31 with the help of eq.([chron ] ) and the standard expectation values of the gaussian white noise variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one finds that @xmath34 our next goal is to discuss the properties of the seo and exemplify these properties using our numerical results for the stochastic abc model that we discuss in the next section .",
    "the stochastic abc model on a 3-torus is defined by its flow vector field and the three `` euclidian '' @xmath35 s , @xmath36 the vector fields @xmath37 s represent the flat metric on the 3-torus , for which the diffusion laplacian is the hodge laplacian , @xmath38,\\label{hodgelap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the so - called co - differential operator ( see eq.([interriormultiplication ] ) below for the definition of @xmath40 ) .",
    "eqs.([seo ] ) , ( [ abc ] ) , and ( [ hodgelap ] ) provide the seo of the stochastic abc model , @xmath41.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inverse temperature , @xmath42 , is known in the kd theory as the magnetic reynolds number and it parametrises physical diffusivity of the magnetic field in units of the turbulent diffusivity of the flow . if @xmath43 , the magnetic field is perfectly frozen into the flow of the conducting medium .",
    "the procedure for the construction of the seo on the square lattice of the 3-torus is described in the appendix . there , one of the parameters of the model is the lattice constant , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of lattice sites in each of the three directions .",
    "it is understood that the finer the lattice , or equivalently the larger the @xmath45 , the more accurate numerical representations of the seo one obtains and thus the more trustworthy results one gets . on the other hand , the computer time taken up by the diagonalization procedure involved in the spectrum calculation increases dramatically with @xmath45 . in order to find balance between accuracy and the availability of the machine - time resources",
    ", we compared the results for different @xmath45 s .    in fig .",
    "( [ figure_1 ] ) , the phase diagrams of the stochastic abc model for the four different choices of @xmath45 are presented .",
    "as is seen , the phase diagrams for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are qualitatively the same . from this observation we conclude that for this particular range of parameters ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 already provides a reasonably good approximation for the seo .",
    "all the subsequent numerical results are therefore obtained for this particular choice of @xmath50 .    to improve our confidence in the results with @xmath50 , we compared the value of the real part of the ground state of the model with @xmath51 with the results obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure_1]e , our method with @xmath50 reproduces the results of ref .",
    "@xcite qualitatively well .",
    "note that only the situations with spontaneously broken supersymmetry can be compared ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "the point is that the employed method of finding the `` fastest growing '' eigenvalue provides zero eigenvalue of the supersymmetric states for the situations with unbroken supersymmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , only the @xmath54-exact non - supersymmetric eigenstates that represent the field tensor of the magnetic field of the kd effect are considered .",
    "this is the reason why the real part of the ground state eigenvalue of our method coincides with the magnetic field growth rate in ref.@xcite only when the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken and the ground state is the @xmath54-exact non - supersymmetric eigenstate of the second degree with the fastest growth rate .",
    "the goal of this section is to discuss the properties of the seo and demonstrate them using the numerical results obtained for the stochastic abc model .",
    "the seo is a real operator and consequently its eigenstates are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs known in the dynamical systems theory as ruelle - pollicott resonances .",
    "also , for non - degenerate noise - induced metric on @xmath0 , @xmath55 , which is the case for the stochastic abc model , and for non - zero temperature and/or reciprocal of the reynolds number , the seo is elliptic and the real part of its eigenvalues is bounded from below .",
    "both of these properties can be observed in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] , where the spectra of the seo for different parameters of the stochastic abc model are presented .",
    "an operator with these properties is pseudo - hermitian @xcite .",
    "it has the so - called complete bi - orthogonal eigensystem .",
    "furthermore , the seo does not `` mix '' differential forms of different degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ , it conserves the number of fermions ( see below ) , so that it can be looked upon as a block diagonal operator , @xmath56 with each @xmath57 being pseudo - hermitian .",
    "the eigensystem of the seo can now be introduced , @xmath58 here , kets of the eigenstates are k - forms , @xmath59 , and the bras are the differential forms of the complementary degrees , @xmath60 , so that the overlap @xmath61 does not vanish .    to establish the supersymmetric structure underlying stochastic evolution let us introduce fermionic or grassmann anticommuting variables , @xmath62 , @xmath63 _ etc_. in these new notations , the wavefunction ( [ k_forms ] ) can be given as , @xmath64 let us also recall the cartan formula for the lie derivative , @xmath65,\\label{cartanformula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath66 is the exterior derivative or de rahm operator , and @xmath67 is the interior multiplication operator .",
    "the commutator in eq.([cartanformula ] ) denotes bi - graded commutator , which is an anticommutator if both operators are `` bosonic '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , have odd number of fermionic operators , and it is a commutator otherwise . in particular , the bi - graded commutator in eq.([cartanformula ] ) is an anticommutator .",

    "symmetries reveal themselves as protected degeneracies of the eigenstates of evolution operators .",
    "more technically , it is said that the multiplets , _",
    "i.e. _ , the eigenstates corresponding to a degenerate eigenvalue , are irreducible representations of the corresponding symmetry group . in case of the topological supersymmetry , @xmath54 , the multiplets are the non - supersymmetric doublets or the boson - fermion pairs , _",
    "i.e. _ , all non - supersymmetric eigenstates come in pairs of even and odd degrees , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "it can be shown that all eigenstates with non - zero eigenvalues are non - supersymmetric as is also seen in fig.[figure_2 ] , where the non - supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates are indicated using the same symbol ( circled crosses , crosses , and diamonds ) .    some of the eigenstates are supersymmetric singlets such that @xmath78 and no state @xmath79 exists such that @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , this property of the supersymmetric eigenstates is nothing else but the requirement for a state to be non - trivial in de rahm cohomology @xcite .",
    "all supersymmetric states have strictly zero eigenvalue and each de rahm cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate , because otherwise the eigensystem of the seo would not be complete , which would be in contradiction with the idea that elliptic pseudo - hermitian operators on compact phase spaces have complete eigensystems @xcite .",
    "the fact that each de rahm cohomology class provides one zero - eigenvalue supersymmetric eigenstate can be observed in fig .",
    "[ figure_2]a , where insets zoom into the small area around the origin .",
    "it is seen that the number of eigenstates with zero eigenvalue ( within the numerical accuracy of our calculations ) equals the betti number of the same degree , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of different de rahm cohomology classes of a given degree @xcite , which in the case of 3-torus is @xmath81 for @xmath82 , respectively .    the ground states of the model are the ones with the fastest `` growth rate '' according to their temporal evolution @xmath83 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the states with the minimal real part of their eigenvalues . when the zero - eigenvalue supersymmetric states are the ground states , it is said that the supersymmetry is unbroken .",
    "among the five spectra presented in fig.[figure_2 ] , only @xmath84 has unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "for all the other spectra , the ground states have non - zero eigenvalues , real for @xmath85 and complex for @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . for these spectra",
    ", the topological supersymmetry is broken spontaneously because the ground states are non - supersymmetric .",
    "the phenomenon of the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking can be looked upon as the stochastic generalization of deterministic chaos , @xcite whereas in the kd theory , it corresponds to the existence of the exponentially growing modes of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that all models possess pseudo - time reversal symmetry @xcite . this is the symmetry of the seos of two sdes related to each other by the reversal of time , @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the seo of the sde with the reversed flow , @xmath90 , and reversed noise vector fields , @xmath91 ( the reversing of @xmath37 s has no effect in eq.([seo ] ) , however ) , and @xmath92 is some invertible operator .",
    "any two operators related by a similarity transformation such as eq.([similar ] ) are isospectral .",

    "this isospectrality will be used again in a moment to conclude that @xmath96 alone never breaks supersymmetry spontaneously , just as @xmath97 .",
    "as already mentioned , the wavefunctions of the top ( or @xmath98 ) degree represent total probability distributions .",
    "also , all non - supersymmetric eigenstates of the top degree are @xmath54-exact , _ i.e. _ , of the form @xmath77 , @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that the integral over such eigenstate over @xmath0 is zero and , consequently , somewhere on @xmath0 these non - supersymmetric eigenstates are negative .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the supersymmetry can not be broken spontaneously by the seo of the top degree ( @xmath97 ) . indeed , if it is a non - supersymmetric eigenstate(s ) that has the fastest growing rate in @xmath100 , then an arbitrary total probability distribution would become negative somewhere on @xmath0 after a sufficiently long temporal evolution when this non - supersymmetric ground state would provide a dominant contribution .",
    "negative total probability distributions , on the other hand , are unphysical .    also , since @xmath101 never breaks topological supersymmetry and , at the same time , it is isospectral to @xmath96 , we conclude that @xmath96 also never breaks topological supersymmetry spontaneously .",
    "the fact that neither @xmath97 nor @xmath96 break topological supersymmetry spontaneously can be observed in all the spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] .    at last , our results presented in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] as well as those obtained but not presented in this paper seemingly suggest that the seo of complementary degrees are isospectral , @xmath102 . as of this moment",
    ", we do know under what conditions this symmetry of the seo is present and what are its mathematical and/or physical origins .",
    "in this paper , we numerically investigated the stochastic evolution operator of stochastic abc model .",
    "the following general properties of the stochastic evolution operators , that were known previously , are confirmed : every de rahm cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate ; the stochastic evolution operators of the zeroth and top degrees separately never break topological supersymmetry ; and stochastic models possess pseudo - time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that the stochastic evolution operators of complementary degrees may be isospectral .",
    "we hope that further work on the sts will reveal the mathematical and/or physical reasons that stand behind of this symmetry of the stochastic evolution operators .",

    "the poincar duals of submanifolds , in their turn , are the differential forms that are constant functions ( with no differentials ) on these submanifolds and that are delta - functional distributions ( with differentials ) in the transverse directions .",
