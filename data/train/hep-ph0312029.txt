    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is one of the basic processes for investigating the structure of hadrons .",

    "the imaginary part of @xmath11 is proportional to the forward compton amplitude when the deeply off - shell photon with virtuality @xmath12 scatters off an on - shell hadron with momentum @xmath13 . for the electron - hadron dis ,",
    "the spin - dependent part,@xmath14 , of @xmath11 is    @xmath15 \\approx \\imath \\epsilon_{\\mu \\mu \\lambda \\rho } \\frac{q_{\\lambda } m}{pq } \\big [ s_{\\rho}^{|| } g_1 + s_{\\rho}^{\\perp}\\big(g_1 + g_2 \\big ) \\big]\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the hadron mass , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the longltudinal and transverse ( with respect to the plane formed by @xmath13 and @xmath19 ) components of the hadron spin @xmath20 ; @xmath0 and @xmath21 are the spin structure functions .",
    "both of them depend on @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , small @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath24 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath25 and therefore the part of @xmath14 related to @xmath0 does not depend on @xmath16",
    ". then if @xmath26 , one can assume the factorization and regard @xmath14 as a convolution of two objects ( see fig .  [ dubnafig1 ] ) .",
    "the first of them is    ( 280,100 ) ( 10,10 )    the probability @xmath27 ( @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ dubnafig1]a and @xmath29 in fig .  [ dubnafig1]b ) to find a polarized parton ( a quark or a gluon ) in the hadron .",
    "the second one is the partonic tensor @xmath30 defined and parametrized similarly to @xmath14 . whereas @xmath31 are essentially non - perturbative objects , the partonic tensor @xmath30 , i.e. the partonic structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath21 , can be studied within perturbative qcd .",
    "the lack of knowledge of @xmath27 is usually compensated by introducing initial parton distributions that are found from pheneomenological considerations . on the contrary",
    ", there are regular perturbative methods for calculating the structure functions in the partonic tensor @xmath30 .",
    "the best known instrument to calculate the structure functions to all orders in @xmath32 is the dglap@xcite approach .",
    "once applied to the description of the experimental data , dglap provides good results@xcite .",
    "the extrapolation into the small-@xmath1 region of dglap predicts an asymptotical behaviour @xmath33 for all dis structure functions ( with different factors @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , from a theoretical point of view , such an extrapolation is rather doubtful . in particular",
    ", it neglects in a systemetical way contributions @xmath35 which are small when @xmath36 but become large when @xmath5 .",
    "the total resummation of these double - logarithmic ( dl ) contributions made in refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for the non - singlet @xmath37 and singlet @xmath0 respectively leads to the regge ( power - like ) asymptotics @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the intercepts calculated ib the double - logarithmic approximation ( dla ) .",
    "the weakest point of refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite is the fact that they keep @xmath32 fixed ( at some unknown scale ) .",
    "it leads therefore to the intercepts @xmath39 explicitly depending on this unknown coupling , whereas @xmath32 is well - known to be running .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite led many authors ( see e.g.@xcite ) to suggest that the dglap parametrization @xmath40 has to be used .",
    "however , according to results of ref .",
    "@xcite , such a parametrization is correct only for @xmath36 and can not be used for @xmath5 .",
    "the explicit dependence of @xmath32 suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite has been used to calculate both @xmath41 and @xmath0 at small @xmath1 in refs .",
    "the present talk is based on the results obtained in those papers .    instead of a direct study of @xmath0 ,",
    "it is more convenient to consider the forward compton amplitude @xmath42 related to @xmath0 as follows :    @xmath43    we can not use dglap for studying @xmath0 or @xmath42 at small @xmath1 because it does not account for double - log ( and single - log ) contributions which are independent of @xmath44 . in order to account for the double - logs of both @xmath1 and @xmath44 , we need to construct two - dimensional evolution equations that would combine the @xmath1- and @xmath44- evolutions . on the other hand",
    ", these equations should sum up the contributions of the feynman graphs involved to all orders in @xmath32 . some of those graphs have either ultraviolet or infrared ( ir ) divergencies .",
    "the ultraviolet divergencies are regulated by the usual renormalization procedure . in order to regulate the ir ones",
    ", we have to introduce an ir cut - off .",
    "we use the ir cut - off @xmath45 in the transverse momentum space for momenta @xmath46 of all virtual quarks and gluons :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 stands for the transverse ( with respect to the plane formed by the external momenta @xmath13 and @xmath19 ) component of @xmath46 .",
    "this way of regulating the ir divergencies was suggested by l.n .",
    "lipatov and used first in ref .",
    "@xcite for quark - quark scattering . using this cut - off @xmath45",
    ", @xmath42 acquires a dependence on @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , one can evolve @xmath42 with respect to @xmath45 , constructing thereby some infrared evolution equations ( iree ) .",

    "it must be noted that the transform inverse to eq .",
    "( [ mellin ] ) involves the imaginary parts of @xmath42 :    @xmath56    notice that contrary to the amplitude @xmath42 , the structure function @xmath0 does not have any signature and therefore @xmath57 when the transform  ( [ mellin ] ) is applied directly to @xmath0 .",

    "[ dubnafig1 ] is assumed , the calculation of @xmath0 ( we will not use the superscript `` s '' for@xmath0 singlet , though we use the notaion @xmath41 for the non - singlet @xmath0 ) is reduced to calculating the feynman graphs contributing the partonic tensor @xmath30 depicted as the upper blobs in fig .",
    "[ dubnafig1 ] . both cases , ( a ) , when the virtual photon scatters off the nearly on - shell polarized quark , and ( b ) , when the quark is replaced by the polarized gluon , should be taken into account .",

    "we call such a parton the softest one .",
    "if it is a gluon , its dl contribution can be factorized , i.e. its dl contribution comes from the graphs where its propagator is attached to the external lines .",
    "as the gluon propagator can not be attached to photons , this case is absent in iree for @xmath62 .",
