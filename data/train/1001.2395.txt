    "our concern here is to locate the past ( white hole ) horizon . in general dynamical situations",
    "this might be rather nontrivial since the obvious candidate - event horizon - is a global characteristic and therefore the full spacetime evolution is necessary in order to localize it .",
    "therefore , over the past years different quasi - local characterizations of black hole boundary were developed .",
    "the most important ones being apparent horizon @xcite , trapping horizon @xcite and isolated or dynamical horizon @xcite .",
    "the basic _ local _ condition in the above mentioned horizon definitions is effectively the same : these horizons are sliced by marginally trapped hypersurfaces with vanishing expansion of outgoing ( ingoing ) null congruence orthogonal to the surface .    for the vacuum four dimensional robinson ",
    "trautman solutions without cosmological constant the location of the horizon together with its general existence and uniqueness has been studied by tod @xcite , and further by chow and lun @xcite .",
    "these results were recently extended to nonvanishing cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "trautman spacetimes ( containing aligned pure radiation and a cosmological constant @xmath2 ) in any dimension were obtained @xcite by requiring the existence of a twistfree , shearfree and expanding null geodesic congruence .",
    "they have arrived at the following metric valid in higher dimensions @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the unimodular spatial @xmath5-dimensional metric @xmath6 and the function @xmath7 must satisfy the field equation @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 being the rescaled metric and @xmath10 its ricci tensor ) , @xmath11 is a `` mass function '' ( we assume @xmath12 ) .",
    "to localize the past horizon , we will be dealing only with the condition of vanishing expansion defining the marginally trapped hypersurfaces .",
    "the explicit parametrization of the _ past horizon _",
    "hypersurface is @xmath13 such that its intersection with each @xmath14 slice is an outer marginally past trapped ( @xmath15)-surface .    by straight - forward computation ( using a generalization of the tetrad formalism to arbitrary dimension ) one",
    "easily calculates the expansion associated with the outgoing null congruence @xmath16 ( orthogonal to @xmath17 surface ) to be @xmath18 meaning that it is diverging .",
    "this is exactly what one assumes when dealing with the past trapped surface and is the additional condition in the definition of trapping horizon @xcite .",
    "expansion of the ingoing null congruence @xmath19 can be calculated using the formula @xmath20 , where the tensor @xmath21 corresponds to the hypersurface projector . from @xmath22",
    "we get the marginally trapped hypersurface condition ( equivalent to penrose  tod equation in four dimensions ) @xmath23 @xmath24 it is a nonlinear second order partial differential equation , where both the laplacian and scalar product in the last term correspond to the einstein metric @xmath25 .",
    "interesting property of this equation is that for @xmath1 its nonlinearity is much worse since the term quadratic in derivatives appears .",
    "the uniqueness and existence results for equation are derived in ref .",
    "( with @xmath26 and using the previous works refs .  ) and",
    "the results are summarized in the following table :    @xmath27{\\frac{3\\mu}{2\\lambda}}\\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{array}\\ ] ]",
    "the methods used in @xmath0 are not applicable when the equation is of the form ( after the substitution @xmath28 in ( [ pt ] ) , assuming @xmath29 with a suitable constant @xmath30 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is quadratic in gradient .    to prove existence of the solution to this quasilinear equation one can proceed by combining several steps ( motivated by ref .   and using results from refs .  ) .",
    "these steps include the use of maximum principle , fredholm alternative , truncature of functions , schauder fixed point theorem and elliptic estimates .",
    "the main requirement one has to satisfy is the existence of sub- and super - solutions .",
    "one can construct constant sub- and super - solutions ( assuming @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) for any @xmath35 , but for positive cosmological constant one has to demand @xmath36 interestingly , this last condition reduces in the four - dimensional case ( which can be included ) to the condition from the above table for the existence of the solution when @xmath37 ( @xmath38 asymptotically approaches @xmath39 ) .    since according to mathematical results any manifold ( including compact ones ) of dimension greater than or equal to @xmath40",
    "can be endowed with a complete riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature @xcite one should also consider that @xmath41 for our @xmath15-dimensional spatial hypersurface .",
    "however , one can construct constant sub- and super - solutions only for negative cosmological constant .",
    "we have derived the generalization of the penrose  tod equation to higher dimensional robinson - trautman spacetimes including cosmological constant and pure radiation .",
    "using several mathematical tools we have proved the existence of its solution for any @xmath35 and for @xmath34 .",
    "the limitations arising for positive @xmath2 are naturally related to the more complicated horizon structure of relevant spacetimes .",
