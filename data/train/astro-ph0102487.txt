    "the characteristics of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) , bursts of 0.1 mev1 mev photons lasting for a few seconds ( @xcite ) , suggest that the observed radiation is produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding wind , a `` fireball , '' at cosmological distance ( see , e.g. , @xcite for review ) .",
    "the recent detection of delayed low energy ( x - ray to radio ) emission ( afterglow ) from grb sources ( see @xcite for review ) , confirmed both the cosmological origin of the bursts and standard model predictions of afterglows , that result from the collision of an expanding fireball with its surrounding medium ( see @xcite for review ) .    within the fireball model framework ,",

    "we show that large burst - to - burst variations in the fraction of fireball energy converted to neutrinos are not expected , due to two reasons .",

    "second , for wind parameters that imply , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) , @xmath16 values significantly exceeding 20% , only a small fraction of the pions energy is converted to neutrinos due to pion and muon synchrotron losses .",
    "the model we analyze is described in ",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "numerical results are presented and discussed in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusions and implications are summarized in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider a compact source , of linear scale @xmath38  cm , which produces a wind characterized by an average luminosity @xmath39@xmath40 and mass loss rate @xmath41 ( @xmath38  cm corresponds to three times the schwarzschild radius of a non - rotating , solar mass black hole ) . at small radius ,",
    "the wind bulk lorentz factor , @xmath21 , grows linearly with radius , until most of the wind energy is converted to kinetic energy and @xmath21 saturates at @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is required to reduce the wind pair - production optical depth for observed high energy , @xmath44  mev , photons to less than unity . if @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47  cm , the wind becomes optically thin at @xmath48 , and hence acceleration saturates at @xmath49 and the remaining wind internal energy escapes as thermal radiation at @xmath13  mev temperature .",
    "variability of the source on time scale @xmath20 , resulting in fluctuations in the wind bulk lorentz factor @xmath21 on similar time scale , leads to internal shocks in the expanding fireball at a radius @xmath50 .",
    "if the lorentz factor variability within the wind is significant , internal shocks reconvert a substantial part of the kinetic energy to internal energy .",
    "it is assumed that this energy is then radiated as @xmath0-rays by synchrotron ( and inverse - compton ) emission of shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the dynamics of our model is described in   [ sec : dynamics ] , and neutrino production calculations are described in   [ sec : nus ] .      in this work ,",
    "we use an approximate model of the unsteady wind described in the preceding paragraph , following spada , panaitescu & mszros 2000 , and guetta , spada & waxman 2000 ( gsw00 ) .",
    "the wind evolution is followed starting at radii larger than the saturation radius , i.e. after the shells have already reached their final lorenz factor following the acceleration phase , and the grb photon flux and spectrum resulting from a series of internal shocks that occur within the wind at larger radii are calculated .",
    "the wind flow is approximated as a set of discrete shells .",
    "each shell is characterized by four parameters : ejection time @xmath51 , where the subscript @xmath52 denotes the @xmath52-th shell , lorentz factor @xmath53 , mass @xmath54 , and width @xmath55 . since the wind duration , @xmath56  s , is much larger than the dynamical time of the source , @xmath57 , variability of the wind on a wide range of time scales , @xmath58 , is possible . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a case where the wind variability is characterized by a single time scale @xmath59 , in addition to the dynamical time scale of the source @xmath60 and to the wind duration @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we consider shells of initial thickness @xmath62 , ejected from the source at an average rate @xmath63 .    in gsw00 we have examined the dependence of observed @xmath0-ray flux and spectrum on wind model parameters , taking into account both synchrotron and inverse - compton emission , and the effect of @xmath64 pair production .",
    "we have assumed there that the lorenz factor of a given shell is independent of those of preceding shells , and considered various lorentz factor distributions .",
    "we have shown that in order to obtain @xmath0-ray flux and spectrum consistent with observations , large variance is required in wind lorentz factor distribution .",
    "we therefore restrict the following discussion to the bimodal case , where lorentz factors are drawn from a bimodal distribution , @xmath65 or @xmath66 , with equal probability . the time intervals @xmath67",
    "are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution with an average value of @xmath68 . in gsw00",
    "we have considered two qualitatively different scenarios for shell masses distribution , shells of either equal mass or equal energy , and concluded that observations favor shells of equal mass .",
    "we therefore restrict the following discussion to the equal shell mass case .",
    "we note , however , that our conclusions are not sensitive to this assumption .",
    "once shell parameters are determined , we calculate the radii where collisions occur and determine the photon and neutrino emission from each collision . in each collision a forward and a reverse shock are formed , propagating into forward and backward shells respectively .",
    "the plasma parameters behind each shock are determined by the taub adiabatic , requiring continuous energy density and velocity across the contact discontinuity separating the two shells ( panaitescu & mszros 1999 ) .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) of the protons shock thermal energy is converted to electrons ( magnetic field ) .",
    "we assume that both electrons and protons are accelerated by the shocks to a a power - law distribution , @xmath71 for particle lorentz factors @xmath72 .",
    "the maximum lorenz factor is determined by equating the acceleration time , estimated as the larmor radius divided by @xmath73 , to the minimum of the dynamical time and the synchrotron cooling time .    the calculation of emitted @xmath0-ray spectrum and flux is carried according to the method described in detail in gsw00 , taking into account both synchrotron and inverse compton emission , as well as the effect of the optical thickness due to thomson scattering on both electrons present initially in the flow and those created by pair production . here",
    "we focus on neutrino production by photo - meson interactions , following waxman & bahcall 1997 .",
    "our method of calculation is described below .",
    "the fraction @xmath74 of proton energy lost to pion production is estimated as @xmath75 where @xmath20 is the comoving shell expansion time and @xmath76 is the proton photo - pion energy loss time ( waxman & bahcall 1997 ) , @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the cross section for the pion production for a photon with energy @xmath79 in the proton rest frame , @xmath80 is the average fraction of energy lost to the pion , and @xmath81 is the comoving number density of photons per unit energy . in our calculations , we have approximated the integral , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpi ] ) , by the contribution from the @xmath8 resonance .",
    "this approximation is valid for grb photon spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "photo - meson production of low energy protons , well below @xmath26 , requires interaction with high energy photons , well above @xmath19 .",
    "such photons may be depleted by pair production . for each collision",
    "we find the photon energy @xmath82 , for which the pair production optical thickness , @xmath83 , is unity .",
    "a large fraction of photons of energy exceeding @xmath84 ( measured in the shell frame ) will be converted to pairs , and hence will not be available for photo - meson interaction , leading to a suppression of the neutrino flux at low energies . in order to take this effect into account",
    ", we use @xmath85 $ ] for protons interacting with photons which are strongly suppressed by pair production .",
    "neutrino production is suppressed at high energy , where neutrinos are produced by the decay of muons and pions whose lifetime @xmath86 exceeds the characteristic time for energy loss due to synchrotron emission ( waxman & bahcall 1997 , 1999 , rachen & mszars 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore define an effective @xmath16 , @xmath87 , as @xmath88 times the fraction of pions energy converted to muon neutrinos . in the absence of pion and muon energy loss , @xmath89 of the pions energy",
    "is converted to muon neutrinos , since @xmath90 the energy of charged pions is converted to @xmath91 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is the fraction of proton energy that , in the absence of synchrotron losses , leads to approximately the same muon neutrino flux as that obtained when synchrotron losses are taken into account .    in each collision a fraction of the kinetic energy of the colliding shell is converted to a flux of photons and neutrinos .",
    "the energy that is not lost to photons and neutrinos is converted back to kinetic energy by adiabatic expansion of the shell .",
    "in this section we determine the dependence of @xmath87 , the fraction of proton energy that in the absence of synchrotron losses leads to approximately the same muon neutrino flux as that obtained when synchrotron losses are taken into account , on wind model parameters .",
    "we adopt electron and magnetic field energy fractions close to equipartition , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the equipartition fractions are required to satisfy @xmath95 and @xmath93 in order to account for observed @xmath0-ray emission ( e.g. gsw00 ) . moreover ,",
    "@xmath69 values in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 are typically derived from grb afterglow observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath96 is required to account for observed @xmath0-ray and afterglow spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 presents contour plots of the photon break energy , @xmath19 , as function of @xmath97 and @xmath68 for @xmath98 and and @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "the qualitative behavior demonstrated by the contour plot can be understood based on the following arguments .",
    "the wind energy density at the smallest radii of the internal dissipation shocks is lower for higher values of @xmath97 , leading to a decrease of @xmath19 with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "this effect sets the upper bound on @xmath97 values . lowering the value of @xmath97 leads to increase in @xmath19 together with increase in the wind optical depth at the smallest internal shocks radii . once the optical depth exceeds unity , emission is strongly suppressed leading to a rapid decrease with @xmath97 of both the fraction of wind energy escaping as radiation and @xmath19 ( see gsw00 for detailed discussion ) .    figures 2 presents the contour plot for the effective @xmath16 , @xmath87 , for the case shown in figure 1 with @xmath99 .",
    "the values shown are averaged over all internal collisions , weighted by the energy converted to high energy protons in each collision .",
    "values of @xmath16 are shown for several neutrino energy ranges , using the approximation @xmath101 .",
    "the region in @xmath97@xmath68 plane where @xmath102  mev is bound in figures 2 by the dashed line .",
    "the dash - dotted line outlines the region in which the fraction of wind energy converted to radiation exceeds 2% ( higher fraction is obtained for larger @xmath97 values ) . for wind parameters consistent with observed grb characteristics ,",
    "the effective value of @xmath16 at high neutrino energy , @xmath103 , is restricted to values in the range of @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "figure 3 presents the fraction @xmath106 of the fireball neutrino flux produced by internal shocks which are optically thin to radiation .",
    "while at high energy most of the neutrino flux is produced in the optically thin regime , where collisions also contribute to the photon flux , a large fraction , @xmath107 , of the neutrino flux at low energy is produced by collisions which do not contribute to the observed gamma - ray flux .",
    "the optically thick collisions provide a significant contribution only at low energy , since the large energy density at these collisions lead to strong suppression of high energy neutrino production by muon and pion synchrotron losses .    in figure 4 we present contour plots of @xmath108 , neglecting the effects on neutrino production of synchrotron losses and pair - production .",
    "@xmath108 approaches unity at low values of @xmath97 for low proton ( neutrino ) energy , and at intermediate values of @xmath97 for high proton ( neutrino ) energy .",
    "the energy loss of pions and muons due to synchrotron emission reduces the fraction of pion energy converted to neutrinos , and hence suppresses the effective value of @xmath108 , to the range of values shown in figure 2 .",
    "the suppression seen in figure 4 of @xmath16 at low @xmath97 for high energy protons is due to the fact that for low values of @xmath97 most collisions occur at small radii , where synchrotron losses of high energy protons prevent acceleration of protons to ultra - high energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "ultra - high energy protons are produced in this case only at secondary collisions at large radii , where the photon energy density is already low , resulting in smaller values of @xmath16 .",
    "figures 5 and 6 present @xmath87 for @xmath98 , @xmath100 and @xmath109 @xmath99 respectively . comparing to the results presented in figure 2 , we find that the qualitative behavior as well as the predicted values of @xmath87 are not sensitive to wind luminosity and magnetic field equipartition fraction ( over the range allowed by grb observations ) .",
    "the neutrino break energy inferred from figures 2 , 5 and 6 , @xmath110  ev , is somewhat higher than estimated by waxman & bahcall ( 1997 ) , @xmath111  ev [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : enub ] ) ] , since the photon energy break in our wind models is typically @xmath112  mev , rather than @xmath113  mev . note , that although synchrotron losses suppress neutrino production at high energy ( compare figures 2 and 4 ) , the increase in @xmath16 at high energy ( figure 2 ) implies that the neutrino flux is flat , with roughly equal energy per logarithmic neutrino energy interval above @xmath114 , in contrast with the expectation of strong suppression of neutrino flux at @xmath115  ev ( waxman & bahcall 1997 , 1999 , rachen & mszars 1998 ) .",
    "this is due to two effects .",
    "first , high energy protons and neutrinos are produced in the present model over a very wide range of radii , over part of which synchrotron losses are small .",
    "second , the low energy , @xmath116 , photon spectrum obtained in the present model , @xmath117 , is softer than assumed in previous analyses , @xmath118 .",
    "grb observation suggest that the latter , harder , spectrum is closer to reality , and steepening of the spectrum at low photon energy is indeed expected due to effects not included in the present analysis , such as inverse - compton suppression and photospheric emission ( see gsw00 for discussion ) .",
    "thus , the present analysis most likely overestimates the value of @xmath87 for @xmath119 .",
    "we have studied neutrino production in grbs , within the framework of the dissipative fireball model .",
    "we have considered photo - meson production of neutrinos in internal dissipation shocks by interaction of accelerated protons with observed @xmath0-rays , taking into account synchrotron losses of high energy pions and muons and pair - production interaction of high energy photons .",
    "our main results are presented in figures 2 , 5 and 6 , showing the dependence on fireball wind model parameters of @xmath87 , the fraction of proton energy that in the absence of synchrotron losses leads to approximately the same muon neutrino flux as that obtained when synchrotron losses are taken into account ( @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88 times the fraction of pions energy converted to muon neutrinos ) . over the range of wind model parameters , which produce photon break energy consistent with observations ( bounded by the dashed line in the figures ) ,",
    "the value of @xmath87 at high neutrino energy , @xmath103 , is within the range of @xmath104 to @xmath105 . the weak dependence of @xmath87 on wind model parameters , in contrast with the strong dependence implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) , is due to two reasons .",
    "first , for low values of @xmath21 and @xmath20 , where large values of @xmath16 are implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) , only a small fraction of the pions energy is converted to neutrinos at high proton energy due to pion and muon synchrotron losses ( compare figures 2 and 4 ) .",
    "second , the observational constraints imposed by @xmath0-ray observations imply that wind model parameters ( @xmath21 , @xmath37 , @xmath20 ) are correlated .",
    "our results imply that grb neutrino flux of individual bursts should correlate mainly with the bursts @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "an estimate of the time averaged neutrino intensity produced by grbs may be obtained as follows .",
    "the average grb fluence over the energy range observed by batse , @xmath120  mev to @xmath121  mev , is @xmath122  ev .",
    "this corresponds to an average @xmath0-ray intensity of @xmath123 .",
    "the energy emitted as @xmath0-rays is the energy converted to high energy electrons in internal fireball shocks which are optically thin to @xmath0-rays ( the electron synchrotron cooling time is short compared to the wind dynamical time ) . denoting the fraction of thermal proton energy converted to electrons in internal shocks by @xmath69 ,",
    "the expected muon neutrino intensity is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the value of @xmath87 averaged over optically thin collisions only , and @xmath126 is the fraction of the neutrino flux produced by optically thin collisions ( the factor of 2 is due to the fact that the electron energy over a logarithmic energy interval is twice that of the photon energy per logarithmic photon energy interval ) .",
    "as discussed in  3 , the contribution of optically thick collisions to neutrino flux is significant only at low energies , see figure 3 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath127 presented in figure 7 is similar to @xmath87 ( figure 2 ) , except at low energy , where it exceeds @xmath87 by a factor of @xmath128 .    for @xmath69 values implied by observations , typically @xmath129 , the neutrino intensity given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : jgrb1 ] ) , which is based on the observed intensity of grb @xmath0-ray photons , is similar to that given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : jgrb ] ) derived based on the assumption that grbs are the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic - rays .",
    "this similarity reflects the fact that the @xmath0-ray energy generation rate of grbs is similar to the generation rate of high energy protons required to account for the observed flux of ultra - high energy cosmic - rays .",
    "note , that we have used many simplifying assumptions in our analysis of the variable fireball wind ( see   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "hence , the numerical values derived by our approximate analysis should not be considered more accurate than the estimates given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpi],[eq : jgrb1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative conclusions regarding the role of synchrotron and pair - production suppression and regarding the weak dependence of @xmath87 on wind model parameters are not sensitive to the details of the approximations we have used , and are therefore of general validity .",
    "we note , in particular , that the value of @xmath87 does not significantly exceed @xmath130 also in wind model parameter regions which are outside the parameter region implied by observations .",
    "finally , we would like to make the following point .",
    "fireball winds with lorentz factors below the range allowed by observations produce low photon luminosity bursts , with characteristic photon energies well below 100  kev ( see gsw00 ) .",
    "while such bursts may not be detected by present photon detectors , and hence we currently have no evidence for their existence , they may contribute to the background neutrino intensity .",
    "constraints on the high energy neutrino intensity may therefore provide constraints on the existence of such non - grb fireballs .",
