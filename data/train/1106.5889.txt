    "quarkonium was proposed as a probe of the qcd matter formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions more than two decades ago . a familiar prediction , quarkonium suppression due to color - screening of the heavy - quark potential in deconfined qcd matter @xcite , has been experimentally searched for at the sps and rhic heavy - ion facilities .",
    "a less familiar prediction was also devised at the same time : quarkonium enhancement due to heavy - quark stopping in deconfined qcd matter @xcite .",
    "the na50 experiment at sps reported the observation of j/@xmath6 and @xmath6 suppression in central heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this observation was also reported for proton - induced reactions on different target nuclei , from be to pb @xcite .",
    "quarkonium absorption in cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) has been hypothesized as the mechanism responsible for quarkonium suppression at mid - rapidity in pa collisions .",
    "a model based on glauber theory , has been developed to estimate the magnitude of quarkonium suppression in central heavy - ion collisions due to quarkonium absorption in cnm .",
    "the magnitude of j/@xmath6 suppression due to dissociation in hot qcd matter was then measured to be about 40% .",
    "one has to consider that the measured j/@xmath6 production consists of prompt - j/@xmath6 ( @xmath11% ) and decay - j/@xmath6 from higher resonances like @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the observed j/@xmath6 suppression would be compatible with the suppression of @xmath12 and @xmath6 resonances .",
    "the na60 experiment measured j/@xmath6 production in pa collisions at the same cm collision energy as the heavy - ion measurements and addressed the dependence of quarkonium suppression with the laboratory proton beam - energy .",
    "a new evaluation of the quarkonium absorption in cnm was performed and a first attempt to consider the parton shadowing was addressed .",
    "the outcome of this analysis is that only about 20 - 30% of the suppression in the most central pb - pb collisions at sps energies is indeed due to dissociation in hot qcd matter @xcite .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic has reported the observation of j/@xmath6 suppression in central au - au collisions at @xmath8=200 gev ( 10 times higher than the maximum energy in the cm at sps ) @xcite .",
    "deuteron - gold collisions have been utilized to measure cnm effects at rhic energies @xcite . as of today , only parton - shadowing and quarkonium - absorption mechanisms have been considered and the d - au j/@xmath6 results are not fully understood . as a consequence ,",
    "j/@xmath6 suppression due to dissociation in hot qcd matter is roughly estimated to be 40 - 80% in central au - au collisions at rhic energies .",
    "this result would suggest higher suppression than that observed at sps .",
    "in addition , the large rapidity coverage of the phenix experiment enables measurements at large rapidity , showing that the suppression is larger than that observed at mid - rapidity .",
    "this is a very intriguing experimental observation , and it has not yet been understood whether its origin is due predominantly to hot or cold nuclear matter effects . finally , the star experiment has measured a smaller suppression at high transverse momentum ( @xmath14 gev/@xmath15 ) at mid - rapidity @xcite although the experimental errors remain large .    the lhc collider has opened a new energy regime for the study of quarkonium in heavy - ion collisions . at these energies",
    "( 15 times higher than the maximum energy in the cm at rhic , and 150 times higher than that at sps ) , on average one j/@xmath6 particle is expected to be produced in every central pb - pb collision , together with about 50 - 100 @xmath15@xmath16 quark pairs .",
    "as suggested in 1988 @xcite , under these conditions the charm quark yield per unit of rapidity could be large enough to enhance the charmonium production in later phases of the hot qcd - matter dynamical evolution , in particular when the energy density is low enough to enable the charmonium bound state to be formed @xcite . at lhc ,",
    "j/@xmath6 is abundantly produced , allowing for detailed studies of its production , such as azimuthal asymmetry , polarization , and @xmath9 is defined as the ratio of the yield measured in nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) to that expected on the basis of the proton - proton yield scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in the nucleus - nucleus reaction . ] and their dependence on rapidity and transverse momentum .",
    "bottomonium resonances are being studied at rhic and lhc and are complementary to the charmonium experimental observations at rhic and at lhc . in particular ,",
    "the bottom rapidity density at lhc is expected to be similar to that of charm at rhic , and color - screening of the @xmath17(2s ) resonance should be similar to that of the j/@xmath6 .",
    "the first results on the j/@xmath6 @xmath9 at lhc down to @xmath0=0 will be presented in this talk . more detailed description of this analysis can be found in @xcite .    the baseline of quarkonium studies in heavy - ion collisions at lhc , as in the previous studies at lower energies , requires the study of quarkonium production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "the lhc provides huge proton - proton luminosities and should provide ppb collisions in the future .",
    "quarkonium studies in proton - proton collisions at this new energy regime might allow further insight to understand its production mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that high - multiplicity pp collisions at lhc could lead to the formation of high energy density qcd matter , similar to heavy ions collisions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the charged particle multiplicity reached in pp collisions at the lhc is similar to that measured in semi - peripheral cu - cu collisions at @xmath8= 200 gev @xcite .",
    "j/@xmath6 production results in pp collisions at @xmath7= 2.76 tev and 7 tev will be presented .",
    "the dependence on charged particle multiplicity ( up to five times the mean charged particle density ) of the j/@xmath6 yields in pp collisions at @xmath7 = 7 tev will be discussed .",
    "more detailed information about these analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "alice @xcite is a general purpose heavy - ion experiment .",
    "it consists of a central part with a pseudo - rapidity coverage of @xmath180.9 , and a muon spectrometer placed at large rapidity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "j/@xmath6 production is measured down to @xmath0=0 in both rapidity regions , at mid - rapidity in the dielectron and at large rapidity in the dimuon decay channel @xcite .",
    "the main detectors used for the dielectron analysis are the inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the its , placed at radii between 3.9 cm and 43 cm , consists of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors , equipped with two layers each of silicon pixel , silicon drift and silicon strip detectors .",
    "the large cylindrical tpc has full azimuthal coverage , with a length of 5 m and radial coverage from 85 cm to 247 cm .",
    "the tpc provides particle identification ( pid ) via the measurement of the specific energy loss ( @xmath20 ) of particles in the detector gas .",
    "its excellent @xmath20 resolution of 5.5% , allows for electron i d .",
    "the time - of - flight ( tof ) enhances the tpc electron i d in pb - pb analysis . the transition radiation detector ( trd ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) detectors are not used in the analysis reported here , but are expected to significantly improve the electron identification and triggering capabilities of the experiment in the future . for the dimuon analysis , the muon spectrometer consists of a frontal absorber followed by a 3 t@xmath21 m dipole magnet , coupled to tracking and triggering devices .",
    "muons produced in the @xmath22 rapidity region are filtered by means of a 10 interaction length ( @xmath23 ) thick frontal absorber made of carbon , concrete and steel , and placed between z=-0.9 and z=-5.0 m from the nominal position of the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "muon tracking is carried out by five tracking stations , positioned between z=-5.2 and z=-14.4 m from the ip , each one based on two planes of cathode pad chambers ( cpc ) .",
    "stations 1 and 2 ( 4 and 5 ) are located upstream ( downstream ) of the dipole magnet , while station 3 is embedded inside the magnet .",
    "a muon triggering system is placed downstream of a 1.2 m thick iron wall ( 7.2 @xmath23 ) , which absorbs frontal - absorber punch - through hadrons , secondary hadrons escaping the frontal - absorber and low - momentum muons ( @xmath24 gev/@xmath15 ) .",
    "the muon triggering system consists of two stations positioned at z=-16.1 and z=-17.1 m from the ip , each equipped with two planes of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) . throughout its full length , a conical absorber made of tungsten , lead and steel",
    "protects the muon spectrometer against secondary particles produced by the interaction of large-@xmath25 primaries in the beam pipe .",
    "the forward vzero detectors , made of two scintillator arrays , covering the range @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and positioned at z=340 and z=-90 cm from the ip respectively , are used for triggering , beam - gas rejection and centrality selection purposes .",
    "finally , the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) placed 116 m down and up - stream alice ip are used for rejecting electromagnetic pb - pb interactions and satellite pb - pb collisions .    in proton - proton collisions the alice minimum bias trigger ( mb )",
    "is defined as the logical or between the requirement of at least one hit in the its pixel layers ( spd ) , and a signal in one of the two vzero detectors .",
    "alice mb trigger selects about 87% of the proton - proton inelastic cross section .",
    "the cross - sections of the logical and of the vzero detectors were measured during a van der meer scan in pp collisions at 7 tev and 2.76 tev @xcite and were used for the absolute normalization of the inclusive j/@xmath6 cross - section . the muon trigger ( @xmath28-mb ) , which requires , in addition to a mb event , at least one muon in the angular acceptance of the muon spectrometer that fires the muon trigger system ,",
    "is used to take advantage of the full luminosity delivered by the lhc at the ip .",
    "the luminosity enrichment factor of the @xmath28-mb triggered data samples , with respect to the mb trigger , ranges between 1 and 100 , depending on the lhc instantaneous luminosity at the alice ip , which ranges between 1.6 @xmath21 ( 10@xmath29 - 10@xmath30 ) @xmath31s@xmath32 .",
    "the logical and between the its pixel layer and the vzero detector was used as the alice mb trigger in pb - pb collisions .",
    "the mb trigger in pb - pb collisions selects about 97% of the pb - pb total hadronic cross section .",
    "the centrality of the collision is determined from the amplitude of the vzero signal fitted with a geometrical - glauber model .",
    "the pb - pb analysis has been limited to the 0 - 80% most central collisions , where the contamination from electromagnetic interactions is negligible @xcite .",
    "j/@xmath6 production is being studied extensively in alice : as a function of the centre of mass energy , transverse momentum , rapidity and of the charged particle density .",
    "furthermore , a polarization analysis is being performed and first performance results of j/@xmath6 from b mesons decay have been obtained . a total integrated luminosity of about 125 nb@xmath32 was collected by alice in pp collisions at 7 tev in 2010 in the @xmath28-mb trigger and about 10 nb@xmath32 in the mb trigger .",
