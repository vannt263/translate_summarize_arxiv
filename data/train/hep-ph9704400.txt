    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has passed through an intense experimental scrutiny that confirmed several of its predictions . in particular",
    ", the precise lepi measurements performed at the @xmath0 pole show that the sm describes extremely well the couplings between the gauge bosons and the light fermions @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , the couplings of the top quark to the gauge bosons are still rather poorly measured at the tevatron @xmath3 collider @xcite . furthermore , some other elements of the sm , such as the symmetry breaking mechanism , have not been directly tested yet .",
    "if the breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry takes place via the higgs mechanism with a relatively light elementary higgs boson , both the symmetry breaking and the fermion mass generation can have a common origin .",
    "however , if no fundamental higgs particle is present in the theory , the mechanism that breaks the electroweak symmetry and the one that gives rise to the fermion masses are not necessarily related , and we can envisage a breaking in the universality of the fermionic interactions @xcite . one may expect that the top quark , being the heaviest of the known fermions , should be more sensitive to the existence of new physics in the electroweak breaking sector .",
    "this is certainly the case if , for instance , the breaking of the electroweak symmetry occurs dynamically via the appearance of a @xmath5 condensate @xcite .    whatever the dynamics of the symmetry breaking mechanism is , renormalizability requires that this breaking must occur spontaneously .",
    "this leads to the existence of goldstone bosons associated with the broken directions which become the longitudinal components of the massive gauge bosons . assuming this as our starting point",
    ", we can build effective low  energy lagrangians which describe the interactions of these goldstone bosons .",
    "the self  interactions of the goldstone bosons , to lowest order , are totally determined by the symmetry breaking pattern and it is described in terms of a unique dimensionful parameter @xmath6 .",
    "however , the interactions between the goldstone bosons and other fields , such as fermions , involve new unknown parameters that , when the interaction is gauged , leads , in general , to universality violation in the couplings between gauge boson and fermions .",
    "limits on universality violation in the interactions of the top quark to the gauge bosons have been studied before in ref.@xcite where the authors included only dimension  four operators . in this work ,",
    "we study the most general cp invariant dimension  five lagrangian for the interactions between the goldstone bosons and the top and bottom quarks . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "these lagrangians give rise to non ",
    "universal couplings of the top and bottom quarks to the gauge bosons .",
    "since the slc and lepi achieved a precision of the order of @xmath7 percent in some observables , the @xmath0 pole physics is the best available source of information on these interactions .",
    "we obtain the constraints on these anomalous top couplings by imposing that their one  loop contributions to the electroweak parameters are compatible with the @xmath0 pole data @xcite .",
    "if the higgs boson , responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , is very heavy , it can be effectively removed from the physical low  energy spectrum . in this case and for dynamical symmetry breaking scenarios relying on new strong interactions ,",
    "one is led to consider the most general effective lagrangian which employs a nonlinear representation of the spontaneously broken @xmath4 gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the resulting chiral lagrangian is a non ",
    "renormalizable nonlinear @xmath8model coupled in a gauge  invariant way to the yang - mills theory .",
    "this model independent approach incorporates by construction the low  energy theorems @xcite , that predict the general behavior of goldstone boson amplitudes , irrespective of the details of the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "unitarity requires that this low  energy effective theory should be valid up to some energy scale smaller than @xmath9 tev , where new physics would come into play .",
    "in order to specify the effective lagrangian for the goldstone bosons , we assume that the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 , leading to just three goldstone bosons @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . with this choice , the building block of the chiral lagrangian is the dimensionless unimodular matrix field @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath14 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "we implement the @xmath2 custodial symmetry by imposing a unique dimensionful parameter , @xmath6 , for charged and neutral fields . under the action of @xmath18",
