    "the superconducting gap @xmath12 of ceru@xmath0 has been evaluated by point - contact shottky tunneling ( pct ) @xcite , break - junction tunneling ( bjt ) @xcite , point contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) @xcite , and stm experiments @xcite .",
    "the necessity of new pcs experiments is due to the discrepancy between the results obtained by different experimental methods . from the pct measurements 2@xmath1(0)/k@xmath13t@xmath3",
    "is estimated as 6.6@xmath140.6 , while the bjt experiments yielded 2@xmath15(0)/k@xmath13t@xmath3=4.4 .",
    "these values are remarkably larger than our previous pcs result 3.1@xmath160.1 @xcite , which is more consistent with the recent tunneling data 2@xmath1(0)/k@xmath13t@xmath3=3.3 @xcite",
    ". the measurements of the superconducting gap were performed by different methods and on samples of different quality . in this paper",
    "we present a comparison of the superconducting gap behavior of samples with different quality studied by one method .",
    "we also propose a procedure for @xmath1 correction based on taking pair - breaking effect into account , which results in almost equal gap values for both samples .",
    "we have studied the superconducting gap in single - crystal ceru@xmath0 samples by measuring _",
    "dv / di _ for s - c - n ( here s - is a superconductor , c - is a constriction and n - is a normal metal ) point - contacts .",
    "the single crystal was grown by the czochralski pulling method in a tetra - arc furnace .",
    "its residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) is 120 , residual resistivity @xmath17 cm and t@xmath3=6.3k .",
    "the polycrystalline ceru@xmath0 studied in @xcite had rrr=14 , @xmath18 cm and t@xmath19=6.2 k , that is , it had much lower quality .",
    "the point - contact characteristics presented were obtained on the cleaved surface of ceru@xmath0 for both samples .",
    "the sample size was about 1x1x5 mm@xmath20 .",
    "the sample were cleaved in air at room temperature .",
    "the pcs were prepared by touching this surface with the edge of an ag or cu counterelectrode , which were cleaned by chemical polishing .",
    "the experimental cell with the sample and counterelectrode was immersed directly in liquid @xmath21he to ensure good thermal coupling .",
    "the measurements were carried out in the temperature range 1.7 - 6.7 k. the differential resistance _ dv / di _ of the pcs was recorded versus the bias voltage using a standard lock - in amplifier technique , modulating the direct current _",
    "i _ with a small 480 hz ac component .",
    "the blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk ) theory @xcite is commonly used to describe the behavior of the current - voltage characteristics of clean s - c - n microconstrictions . as in our previous publication",
    "[ 3 ] , here we have used this model , which takes into account the andreev reflection on the s - n interface @xcite , to fit the measured _ dv / di(v ) _ curves of pcs . according to the theory @xcite a maximum at zero - bias voltage and a double - minimum structure around _ _",
    "v__@xmath22e on the _ dv / di _ curves manifests the andreev reflection process with a finite barrier strength parameter _ z_.",
    "it follows from the equations for the current - voltage characteristics @xmath23 where f(@xmath24 ) is the fermi distribution function .",

    "dv / di(v ) _ curves of pcs based on the ceru@xmath0 single crystal are presented along with the fitted ones for different temperatures .",
    "the good agreement between experimental and theoretical curves allowed us precisely to determine @xmath1 along with its temperature dependences from calculations according to ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) .",
    "the average value of the gap @xmath12 of the ceru@xmath0 single crystal extracted from the fit for 5 pcs is ( 0.83@xmath330.07 ) mev , with 2@xmath32k@xmath10t@xmath4=3.23@xmath330.23 and t@xmath4= ( 5.9@xmath340.2 ) k. the maximum @xmath1(0 ) was 0.95 mev and t@xmath4=6.1 k , where t@xmath4 is the extrapolated temperature at which the gap drops to zero ( see fig.1,b ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap extracted from the curves on fig.1,a is presented on fig.1,b and has a bcs - like behavior as in the polycrystalline sample @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated critical temperature t@xmath4 for single crystal is higher and the gapless region is smaller than in the polycrystalline sample @xcite .",
    "the gap value ( averaged for 5 pcs as well ) grew from ( 0.51@xmath330.07 ) mev for the polycrystal to the value indicated above for the single crystal of ceru@xmath0 .",
    "this has a natural explanation considering the difference in the quality of the samples .",
    "the contacts made on the more perfect single - crystal ceru@xmath0 exhibited better superconducting properties than those with the polycrystal .    /t@xmath35 and @xmath36(0 ) vs. @xmath37(0 ) curves from ref.8 .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate @xmath38(0)=@xmath390.03 for the single crystal from fig.1 and @xmath390.11 for the polycrystal from fig.1 in ref.3 as determined using the experimental values of t@xmath4/t@xmath40(dotted horizontal lines ) . dashed horizontal lines show the @xmath41(0)=@xmath42 values determined.,width=340 ]    in our previous paper @xcite the presence of a region of gapless superconductivity in ceru@xmath0 between t@xmath4 and t@xmath3 was proposed to explain why t@xmath43 t@xmath3 .",
    "the gap was assumed to be suppressed by the local magnetic moments , presumably ce , distributed randomly in the contact region .",
    "that is , because of the lower purity ( quality ) of the polycrystal some of the ce - ions could be impurities .",
    "the well known abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) theory of a superconductor containing paramagnetic ( pm ) impurities @xcite was considered for explaining a gapless state in ceru@xmath0 .",
    "the theory describes a situation when in the presence of pm impurities the gap @xmath44 in the excitation energy spectrum drops to zero at a transition temperature t@xmath4 , although the material is still a superconductor in the sense of having pair correlations .",
    "the transition temperature t@xmath4 is lower than the critical temperature t@xmath3 , and a range of temperatures between t@xmath4 and t@xmath3 where @xmath45 is zero for any value of the impurity concentration exists .",
    "the scalski - betbeder - matibet - weiss ( sbmw ) - approach @xcite based on ag - theory allows us to take into account a pair breaking caused by spin - exchange scattering . as a measure of this effect produced by pm impurities the inverse collision time for exchange scattering @xmath46 was used .",
    "the advantage of the sbmw approach is the natural way in which the distinction between the energy gap @xmath1 and the order parameter @xmath47 arises when the effect of pm impurities on the density of states is taken into account .",
    "the sbmw theory allows us to calculate the order parameter @xmath47 of a superconductor with pm impurities by transformation of the original expression ( 4.8 ) from @xcite : @xmath48^{3/2}\\ ] ] into the following form : @xmath49^{3/2}.\\ ] ]    in ( 3 ) the pair - breaking parameter @xmath50 is unknown .",
    "it was determined from the t@xmath4/t@xmath35 and @xmath36(0 ) versus @xmath37(0 ) curves ( the superscript p indicates a pure superconductor ; we also suppose that t@xmath51t@xmath3 ) shown in fig.2 .",
    "the value of t@xmath4 was taken from the experimental temperature dependence of @xmath1 as the value extrapolated according to the bcs theoretical curve ( see fig .",
    "then @xmath37(0)=@xmath52 corresponding to t@xmath4/t@xmath35 was determined for the particular point contact , and @xmath53(0)=@xmath54 at the value of @xmath55(0)=@xmath52 determined was specified .",
    "the @xmath56 value was taken from a fit of the experimental curve .",
    "thus we obtained @xmath7(0)=@xmath57 and , hence , @xmath50=@xmath6(0)@xmath58=@xmath59 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath60was found from ( 3 ) to be ( 0.99@xmath330.05 ) mev for the single crystal and ( 0.87@xmath340.1 ) mev for the polycrystal .",
    "fig.3 shows the results of the calculations of @xmath61 from ( 3 ) .",
    "the temperature dependences of the parameter @xmath62 both for the purer sample and for the less perfect one have behavior close to the bcs curve .    the order parameter @xmath6(0 ) of the pure superconductor can be determined from fig.2 using the value of @xmath42 or calculated from the expression ( 3.5 ) of ref.8 : @xmath63 which transforms into @xmath64    the value of @xmath7(0 ) has less scatter in comparison with @xmath65 and is about ( 1.02@xmath660.05 ) mev with 2@xmath67k@xmath10t@xmath3=3.8@xmath660.2 for the single crystal and @xmath7(0)= ( 0.99@xmath660.13)mev with 2@xmath68k@xmath10t@xmath3=3.7@xmath660.5 for the polycrystal .",
    "( t ) for the single - crystal sample from fig.1 ( open squares ) and for the polycrystalline sample from fig.1 . in ref.3 ( triangles).,width=340 ]",
    "as was shown earlier @xcite and in this paper the temperature dependence of @xmath12 in ceru@xmath0 has a bcs - like behavior , but , with a lower critical temperature t@xmath4 . because of the difference in t@xmath4 for the samples of different quality we can conclude that in the cleaner one the influence of impurities on the superconductivity is also weaker .",
    "pair - breaking effects in the contact area can be caused by the randomly distributed local magnetic moments .",
    "it was noted by joseph et al .",
    "@xcite that a ce - rich solid solution is present as a second phase in ceru@xmath0 in an amount up to 10% in the samples of low quality .",
    "this means that pair - breaking effects and gapless superconductivity in the compound more probably are connected with the influence of ce - impurities .",
    "calculations based on the sbmw approach gave very close values of @xmath7(0 ) and 2@xmath68k@xmath10t@xmath3 for poly- and single crystals .",
    "this supports our assumptions about the influence of paramagnetic impurities on superconductivity in ceru@xmath0 and gives a method of @xmath12 correction .",
    "this method of recovering the superconducting parameters from point - contact _ dv / di(v ) _ characteristics can theoretically be improved by including in the btk fit a density of states modified by the pair - breaking effect .",
    "the investigations were carried out in part with the help of donated by alexander von humbold stiftung ( germany ) equipment ."
