    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) appears in various extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , lepton - flavor - violating @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) decays are discussed in various supersymmetric models  @xcite , models with little higgs  @xcite , left - right symmetric models  @xcite as well as models with heavy singlet dirac neutrinos  @xcite and very light pseudoscalar bosons  @xcite .",
    "some of these models with certain combinations of parameters predict that the branching fractions for @xmath5 decays can be as large as @xmath8 , which is in the range already accessible in high - statistics @xmath9 factory experiments .",
    "searches for lepton flavor violation in @xmath10 ( where @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) decays have been performed since 1982  @xcite , starting from the pioneering experiment markii  @xcite . in the previous high - statistics analyses , belle ( babar ) reached 90% confidence level upper limits on the branching fractions of the order of @xmath11  @xcite , based on samples with about 535 ( 376 ) fb@xmath12 of data . here , we update our previous results with a larger data set ( 782 fb@xmath1 ) , collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath2 collider  @xcite , taken at the @xmath13 resonance and 60 mev below it .",
    "we apply the same selection criteria as in the previous analysis , but optimized for the new data sample .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) , all located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field . an iron flux - return located outside",
    "the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath14 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "leptons are identified using likelihood ratios calculated from the response of various subsystems of the detector . for electron identification ,",
    "the likelihood ratio is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the likelihoods for electron and non - electron hypotheses , respectively , determined using the ratio of the energy deposit in the ecl to the momentum measured in the svd and cdc , the shower shape in the ecl , the matching between the position of charged track trajectory and the cluster position in the ecl , the hit information from the acc and the @xmath18 information in the cdc  @xcite . for muon identification",
    ", the likelihood ratio is defined as ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the likelihoods for muon , pion and kaon hypotheses , respectively , based on the matching quality and penetration depth of associated hits in the klm  @xcite .    in order to optimize the event selection and to estimate the signal efficiency , we use monte carlo ( mc ) samples . the signal and",
    "the background ( bg ) events from generic @xmath23 decays are generated by koralb / tauola  @xcite . in the signal mc",
    ", we generate @xmath23 pairs , where one @xmath0 decays into three leptons and the other @xmath0 decays generically .",
    "all leptons from @xmath5 decays are assumed to have a phase space distribution in the @xmath0 lepton s rest frame  @xcite .",
    "other backgrounds including @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) processes , bhabhas , @xmath27 , and two - photon processes are generated by evtgen  @xcite , bhlumi  @xcite , kkmc  @xcite , and aafhb  @xcite , respectively .",
    "all kinematic variables are calculated in the laboratory frame unless otherwise specified .",
    "in particular , variables calculated in the @xmath2 center - of - mass ( cm ) system are indicated by the superscript `` cm '' .",
    "we search for @xmath23 events in which one @xmath0 decays into three leptons  ( signal @xmath0 ) , while the other @xmath0 decays into one charged track , any number of additional photons , and neutrinos  ( tag @xmath0 ) .",
    "candidate @xmath0-pair events are required to have four tracks with zero net charge .",
    "the following @xmath28 decays into three leptons are searched for : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "since each decay mode has a different mix of backgrounds , the event selection is optimized mode by mode .",
    "we optimize the selection criteria to improve the prospect of observing evidence of a genuine signal , rather than to minimize the expected upper limits , as detailed later .",
    "the event selection starts by reconstructing four charged tracks and any number of photons within the fiducial volume defined by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the polar angle relative to the direction opposite to that of the incident @xmath37 beam in the laboratory frame .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath38 ) of each charged track and energy of each photon ( @xmath39 ) are required to satisfy the requirements @xmath40 0.1 gev/@xmath41 and @xmath42 gev , respectively . for each charged track",
    ", the distance of the closest approach with respect to the interaction point is required to be within @xmath430.5 cm in the transverse direction and within @xmath433.0 cm in the longitudinal direction .    the particles in an event",
    "are then separated into two hemispheres referred to as the signal and tag sides using the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis , as calculated from the observed tracks and photon candidates  @xcite .",
    "the tag side contains a charged track while the signal side contains three charged tracks .",
    "we require all charged tracks on the signal side to be identified as leptons .",
    "the electron ( muon ) identification criteria are @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) for momenta greater than 0.3 gev/@xmath41 ( 0.6 gev/@xmath41 ) .",
    "the electron ( muon ) identification efficiency for our selection criteria is 91% ( 85% ) while the probability of misidentifying a pion as an electron ( muon ) is below 0.5% ( 2% ) .    to ensure that the missing particles are neutrinos rather than photons or charged particles that pass outside the detector acceptance",
    ", we impose additional requirements on the missing momentum @xmath46 , which is calculated by subtracting the vector sum of the momenta of all tracks and photons from the sum of the @xmath37 and @xmath47 beam momenta .",
    "we require that the magnitude of @xmath46 be greater than 0.4 gev/@xmath41 and that its direction point into the fiducial volume of the detector .    to reject @xmath48 background ,",
    "the magnitude of thrust ( @xmath49 ) should lie in the range 0.90 @xmath50 0.97 for all modes except for @xmath51 for which we require 0.90 @xmath52 0.96 . the @xmath49 distribution for @xmath53 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thrust ] .",
    "we also require @xmath54 gev @xmath55 gev , where @xmath56 is the total visible energy in the cm system , defined as the sum of the energies of the three leptons , the charged track on the tag side ( with a pion mass hypothesis ) and all photon candidates .",
    "since neutrinos are emitted only on the tag side , the direction of @xmath46 should lie within the tag side of the event .",
    "the cosine of the opening angle between @xmath46 and the charged track on the tag side in the cm system , @xmath57 , is therefore required to lie in the range @xmath58 .",
    "the requirement of @xmath59 suppresses bhabha , @xmath60 and two - photon backgrounds since an undetected radiated photon results in a missing momentum in the same ecl cluster as the tag - side track  @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed mass on the tag side using a charged track ( with a pion mass hypothesis ) and photons , @xmath61 , is required to be less than 1.78 gev/@xmath62 .",
    "conversions ( @xmath63 ) are a large background for the @xmath64 and @xmath32 modes .",
    "we require @xmath65 gev/@xmath62 , to reduce these backgrounds further . for the @xmath51 and @xmath66 modes ,",
    "the charged track on the tag side is required not to be an electron .",
    "we apply the requirement @xmath67 since a large background from two - photon and bhabha events still remains .",
    "furthermore , we reject the event if the projection of the charged track on the tag side is in gaps between the ecl barrel and endcap . to reduce backgrounds from bhabha and @xmath60 events with extra tracks due to interaction with the detector material , we require that the momentum in the cm system of the charged track on the tag side be less than 4.5 gev/@xmath41 for the @xmath51 and @xmath68 modes .",
    "finally , to suppress backgrounds from generic @xmath23 and @xmath48 events , we apply a selection based on the magnitude of the missing momentum @xmath69 and missing mass squared @xmath70 for all modes except for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we do not apply this requirement for these two modes since their backgrounds are much smaller .",
    "we apply different selection criteria depending on whether the @xmath0 decay on the tag side is hadronic or leptonic : the number of emitted neutrinos is two ( one ) when the @xmath0 decay on the tag side is leptonic ( hadronic ) .",
    "therefore , we separate events into two classes according to the track on the tag side : leptonic or hadronic .",
    "the selection criteria are listed in table  [ tbl : misscut ] .    .",
    "selection criteria for the missing momentum ( @xmath73 ) and missing mass squared ( @xmath74 ) for each mode .",
    "the units for @xmath75 and @xmath74 are gev/@xmath41 and @xmath76 , respectively . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +",
    "finally , we examine the signal region and find no events for all considered modes .",
    "therefore , we set upper limits on the branching fractions of @xmath5 based on the feldman - cousins method .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the number of signal events including the systematic uncertainty  ( @xmath77 ) is obtained by the pole program without conditioning  @xcite with the number of expected background events , the number of observed events and the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the upper limit on the branching fraction ( @xmath78 ) is then given by @xmath79 where the number of @xmath0 pairs , @xmath80 , is obtained from the integrated luminosity of 782 fb@xmath1 and the cross section of @xmath0 pair production , which is calculated in the updated version of kkmc  @xcite to be @xmath81 nb .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the branching fractions @xmath82 are in the range between @xmath83 and @xmath84 and are summarized in table  [ tbl : eff ] .",
    "we report results of a search for lepton - flavor - violating @xmath0 decays into three leptons using 782 fb@xmath1 of data .",
    "no events are observed and we set 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the branching fractions : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these results improve the best previously published upper limits by factors from 1.3 to 1.6 , and are the most stringent upper limits of all @xmath0 decays .",
    "these upper limits can be used to constrain the space of parameters in various models beyond the sm .",
