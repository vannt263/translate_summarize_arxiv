    "the standard tools of quantum chaos investigations include random matrix theory and periodic orbit theory ( gutzwiller trace formula ) , the van vleck - morette - gutzwiller propagator , and many techniques and phenomena derived from these approaches .",
    "standing somewhat to the side as an inspired insight is berry s conjecture , which loosely stated is the idea that as @xmath1 eigenstates will be indistinguishable from superpositions of infinitely many ( local ) plane waves with random amplitude , direction , and phase , but with fixed wavelength appropriate to the local kinetic energy . in two dimensions ,",
    "these assumptions result in strictly gaussian statistics of the eigenfunctions and the autocorrelation function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the local wavenumber and @xmath4 .    the berry random plane wave ( rpw)@xcite hypothesis is free of any specific dynamical information , except fixed total energy , which defines the `` ensemble '' ( i.e. microcanonical ) .",
    "the perspective developed here suggests that by extending the rpw hypothesis we can conveniently accommodate many other constraints , incorporating information about real systems .",
    "in fact this program has already begun , with berry s inclusion of the presence of nearby hard walls@xcite , and bies and heller s soft boundary results@xcite , and multiple hard walls@xcite .",
    "related work by urbina and richter@xcite and one of us @xcite may also be viewed in this light .",
    "the idea of random waves subject to constraints is not confined to one particle in two dimensions .",
    "indeed berry gave the @xmath5 - dimensional formula for free particles in his 1977 paper@xcite .",
    "since the underlying idea in the rpw hypothesis is uniform randomness within a quantum context , i.e. the underpinning of quantum statistical mechanics , we must encounter some familiar territory as the rpw hypothesis is extended to the large @xmath5 limit . in 1994 ,",
    "srednicki had suggested that the berry random wave hypothesis was indeed a foundation for quantum statistical mechanics@xcite , and showed that the appropriate canonical ensemble was reached for large @xmath5 , depending on particle statistics .",
    "the present paper shows more specifically what happens as the number of particles increases , through a nonstandard and apparently unpublished asymptotic form for bessel functions ( we have not been able to find it in the literature , although it `` ought '' to be there ) , which encodes the equivalence of the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of statistical mechanics . in making the connections to quantum statistical mechanics",
    "one also needs procedures for incorporating constraints , which are an essential aspect of the theory .",
    "thus our procedures for generalizing the rpw to include constraints , mentioned above , is an essential new feature , since the constrained eigenstates are no longer random in berry s ( and srednicki s ) original sense .    given a continuum at energy @xmath6 , such as in an enclosure with walls very far away , we can perform the average over all random waves as a trace , i.e. @xmath7,\\ ] ] which immediately yields berry s result , apart from normalization which we choose differently here .",
    "however a trace over a basis is independent of any unitary transformation on that basis , so it does not matter whether we use a trace over a complete set of random waves or simple local plane waves ; both give @xmath8 for the case of one free particle in two dimensions . in this way",
    "the imaginary part of the retarded green s function @xmath9=\\delta ( e - h)$ ] becomes central , formally convenient , and equivalent to berry s rpw hypothesis .",
    "we begin by reviewing well known formalism to establish context and notation .",
    "the green function completely characterizes a quantum system , whether it is interacting or not , or has few or many degrees of freedom .",
    "the retarded green function @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the principal value of the integral , is the basis for wavefunction statistics and density matrix information , through the follow relations , with a convenient choice of normalization : @xmath13 where @xmath14\\ ] ] and where @xmath15 stands for the average over the degeneracies .",
    "we take these degeneracies to be of dimension up to @xmath16 , where @xmath5 is the number of particles and @xmath17 the spatial dimension each particle lives in .",
    "( we use boldface notation , e.g. @xmath18 for the @xmath19 degrees of freedom . ) if true degeneracies do not exist in a particular system , we can artificially open the system up to a continuum .",
    "for example , a two dimensional closed billiard does not have a degeneracy , but it acquires one if we open a hole in it and let it communicate with the outside unbounded 2d space .",
    "of course this changes the billiard properties , and the size of the hole might be problematic , but in fact we shall never really have to open a system up in this way .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 then implies the average over all scattering wavefunctions at fixed energy @xmath6 .",
    "there are other interpretations which can be put on the average correlation @xmath21 ; for example we can imagine a large number of potentals which differ in some far away place , and in a way so as to all have an eigenvalue at a particular energy .",
    "then , the average has the interpretation of the average over this `` disorder '' ensemble .",
    "a slightly different procedure is advocated by richter _",
    ", wherein an energy average is taken@xcite .",
    "another interpretation can be applied to individual eigenstates in a closed system , assuming they are at least locally uniform in their properties , by taking the average over different points of origin @xmath22 .",
    "this is particularly appropriate when the analogous classical system is chaotic , as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "we will be evaluating the green functions semiclassically in what follows , restricting the time over which the contributing trajectories propagate .",
    "the wavefunction correlation is equal to the coordinate space matrix element of the constant energy density matrix : @xmath23 reduced density matrices can also be derived from wavefunction correlations ; e.g. @xmath24 the one particle reduced density matrix .",
    "we can approach the correlations via fourier transform from the time domain , since @xmath25 thus the statistics , density matrices and correlations are derivable without further averaging by knowing the time propagator .    in the following ,",
    "we define the green function propagator @xmath26 and the retarded green function propagator @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the heavyside step function @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "it is very rewarding to expand the propagator in semiclassical terms , involving short time ( zero length ) and longer trajectories .",
    "we take @xmath34\\vert { \\bf x}+ { \\bf r}\\rangle$ ] , the very short time semiclassical propagator , which for @xmath5 particles each in d dimensions reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",

    "the wavevector @xmath3 varies with the local potential , i.e. @xmath43 here , using only the extreme short time version of the propagator , we must suppose @xmath44 is not large compared to significant changes in the potential , but this restriction can be removed by using the full semiclassical propagator rather than the short time version . for the case of one particle in two dimensions , @xmath45 , and we recover berry s original result for one particle in 2d , @xmath46 .    according to the short time approximation , for any @xmath5 , @xmath47 } { \\rho(e)}= \\frac{1}{\\rho(e ) } \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\left ( \\frac{k^2}{2\\pi k r}\\right ) ^d\\ j_d(k r ) \\label{main}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .",
    "this result includes interparticle correlations through the potential @xmath49 and the spatial dependence of @xmath50 ; the diagonal @xmath51 limit ( following section ) is equivalent to classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the implications of this for the nondiagonal short time green s function are intriguing . the way @xmath52 is defined",
    ", it does not matter whether one particle is off diagonal ( @xmath53 ) or several or all of them . for given @xmath52",
    ", the green s function will be the same , apart from changes in the potential @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting that although the short time green function is manifestly semiclassical , the energy form , e.g. eq .  [ main ] is obtained by exact fourier transform of the semiclassical propagator , rather than by stationary phase .",

    "the association of the short time propagator with the classical hamiltonian and classical density of states is well known .",
    "the berry rpw hypothesis , the short time propagator , and the classical or weyl ( sometimes called thomas - fermi ) term in the quantum density of states are all closely related .",
    "the quantum spacial integral is over all coordinates , so how does the classical partition function emerge if the classical integral is only over classically allowed coordinates ?",
    "for forbidden positions , @xmath3 is imaginary and can be written as say @xmath62 .",
    "an identity for hankel functions can then be used ( @xmath63 ) to show that the green function is real so that the imaginary part is zero , explaining why the integral is only over classically allowed positions .",
    "as long as @xmath64 ( i.e. diagonal green s function ) the results obtained within the short time propagator approximation for any quantity in the presence of a potential ( _ including _ interparticle potentials such as atom - atom interactions ) will be purely classical .",
    "since we will be discussing the equivalence of the results from the different ensembles for @xmath65 , it is useful to recall how the classical coordinate space densities in the different ensembles can be shown to coincide since this corresponds to the @xmath64 case .",
    "the normalized phase space density in the microcanonical ensemble and the phase space density in the canonical ensemble are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the density of states and partition function are of course the normalization factors so that @xmath68 integrating each phase space density over momentum space allows us to compare the coordinate space densities : @xmath69 with @xmath70 .    using the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the ensemble average of the potential in one of the statistical ensembles",
    ", the coordinate space density becomes @xmath74 in the limit @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) this is @xmath77 this is one of the standard ways of establishing a connection between the ensembles@xcite .",
    "since the diagonal green s function gives classical results we can use it to study classical properties .",
    "for example , we can inquire about the average two particle spacing distribution @xmath78 or the probability density for a single particle @xmath79 starting with the short time semiclassical green s function and the results will coincide with classical microcanonical statistical mechanics .",
    "this statement holds for all @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , in the large @xmath5 limit the canonical ensemble results for these quantities must emerge . this point becomes more interesting for the non - diagonal case , considered next .",
    "as yet we have found nothing too surprising or useful beyond standard classical statistical mechanics .",
    "this changes when we consider the large @xmath5 limit for the non - diagonal green s function , @xmath80 . taking the large @xmath5 limit of eq .",
    "[ main ] , we are confronted with a new question about bessel functions .",
