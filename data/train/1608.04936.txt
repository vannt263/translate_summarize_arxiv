    "the hyperelliptic mapping class group turns out to be a very interesting and important subgroup , in particular its finite subgroups correspond to automorphism groups of hyperelliptic riemann surfaces ",
    "see for example @xcite and references there .",
    "recently we extended the notion of the hyperelliptic mapping class group to nonorientable surfaces @xcite , by defining @xmath39 to be the centraliser of @xmath40 in the mapping class group @xmath41 .",
    "this definition is motivated by the notion of hyperelliptic klein surfaces  see for example @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath40 is the _",
    "hyperelliptic involution _ of @xmath7 and by abuse of notation we write @xmath37 for @xmath40 .    since @xmath34",

    "mapping class groups of projective plane @xmath44 and of klein bottle @xmath45 are finite , hence the first nontrivial case is the group @xmath46 .",
    "this is an interesting case , because it is well known @xcite that @xmath47 in particular , @xmath48 has a faithful linear representation of real dimension 2 .    for @xmath0",
    ", we can produce a faithful linear representation of the hyperelliptic mapping class group @xmath39 as a composition of the section @xmath49 and a faithful linear representation of @xmath36 obtained by korkmaz @xcite or by bigelow and budney @xcite . recall that both of these representations of @xmath36 are obtained form the lawrence  krammer representation of the braid group @xcite .",
    "the above argument is immediate , but the resulting representation of @xmath50 is far from being optimal .",
    "in fact , if we use bigelow  budney representation of @xmath36 ( which has much smaller dimension than the one obtained by korkmaz ) the dimension of the obtained representation of @xmath39 is equal to @xmath51    if @xmath0 , then the hyperelliptic mapping class group @xmath39 has a faithful linear representation of real dimension @xmath1",

    "the orbit space projection @xmath57 induces an epimorphism @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , by rescaling the lawrence - krammer representation of the braid group @xcite , bigelow and budney constructed in the proof of theorem 2.1 of @xcite a faithful linear representation @xmath60 to be more precise , they obtained a representation over @xmath61 , however their argument works without any changes over @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath62 is a subgroup of index 2 in @xmath55 , the later group has an induced faithful linear representation of dimension @xmath63 .",
