    "the dominant mechanism for energy loss ( e.g. , @xmath8 for pure dipole radiation ) shapes the diagonal evolutionary path ( figure 1 , green line ) .",
    "the distribution of millisecond radio pulsars along the green diagonal line will be implicitly coupled with their galactic birth rates ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "synthetic millisecond pulsar populations that are constraint only by standard evolution are sampled from the parameter space ( @xmath10 ) . in order to test whether the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 diversity can be reproduced ,",

    "the results can be summarized as follows :    * no physically motivated p@xmath11 distribution has been able to produce the whole millisecond radio pulsar population consistently .",
    "no viable millisecond x - ray pulsar period distribution could subsequently produce the observed relative ratios of young / old pulsars with relatively high b fields .",
    "* observational selection effects can not account for the rates at which higher magnetic field millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , psr b1937 + 21 ) are observed .",
    "the fraction of observed young / old millisecond radio pulsars with high b fields is higher than what the standard model predicts by several orders of magnitude .",
    "* millisecond radio pulsars with characteristic ages @xmath12  yr are born with p@xmath13 p and small spin - down rates .",
    "figure 2 shows that the apparent enigma of millisecond pulsars with ages older than the age of the galaxy is mainly a manifestation of very low accretion rates experienced during the late stages of their lmxb phase . *",
    "it is necessary to posit the existence of a separate class of progenitors , most likely with a different distribution of magnetic fields , accretion rates and equilibrium spin periods , presumably among the lmxbs that have not been revealed as millisecond x - ray pulsars .",

    "the standard method for estimating ages of pulsars is to infer an age from the rate of spin - down .",
    "the characteristic age ( @xmath14 ) is only an approximation of the generic spin - down age and may give realistic estimates for normal pulsars for which the initial spin periods are likely to be much shorter than their observed periods ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "this method can fail , however , for pulsars with very short periods . for millisecond pulsars ,",
    "the details of the spin - up process pose additional constraints on the period ( @xmath16 ) and spin - down rates ( @xmath17 ) which may consequently affect the age estimate .      to estimate ages of millisecond pulsars , we propose the following method in which constraints arising from the recycling process and mass shedding are implemented : @xmath18\\label{eq : mage1 }          \\\\",

    "p@xmath20 is the mass shedding limit which is expected to be between 0.851.32 ms depending on the equation of state of the ns matter @xcite .",
    "although @xmath21 inherently has numerous sources of uncertainty , the corresponding minimum post - accretion period that defines the spin - up line depends on the total accreted mass , but is insensitive to other parameters ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we parametrically adopt the re - normalized coefficient @xmath22 and use it as a fiducial value .    while the modified spin - down age @xmath3 gives a better estimate for the true age than @xmath23",
    ", it is still a strict upper limit ( as is @xmath23 for msps ) .",
    "the projected underlying age distribution for standard evolution is reproduced in figure 3 .",

    "these millisecond pulsars must have experienced very low accretion rates during the lmxb phase .",
    "* there are two sources of age corruption : ( 1 ) _ age bias _ , which is due to secular acceleration .",
    "older millisecond pulsars may mimic younger ages because the measured spin - down rates ( @xmath17 ) may appear to spin - down faster due to this effect , significantly in some cases .",
    "this bias can be corrected for millisecond pulsars with well determined distances and transverse velocities .",
    "( 2 ) _ age contamination _ , which is primarily driven by low accretion rates experienced during the lmxb phase .",
    "a significant fraction of the millisecond pulsar population is expected to mimic older ages due to this contamination . while a statistical assessment of the cumulative contribution of the `` age contamination '' ( for the population ) is possible @xcite ,",
    "there are no trivial methods which can be used to estimate the contribution to an individual source .",
    "* we estimate that @xmath2630% of millisecond pulsars have ages that are overestimated by a factor of two or more . as a consequence ,",
    "the ns - ns merger rates based on the characteristic ages of binary pulsars are mere underestimates . *",
    "while a braking index of n=3 is consistent with the millisecond pulsar @xmath0-@xmath1 demographics , it is challenging to disentangle the combined effects of a possible early phase during which energy was lost by more efficient processes such as gravitational wave radiation ( n=5 ) , and a subsequent secular evolution with torques less efficient than dipole radiation ( n<3 ) .",
    "in recent years , the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has increased to a level which allows us to probe the underlying neutron star ( ns ) mass distribution in detail .",
    "here , i briefly review the range of expected masses and how they compare to the mass distribution inferred from radio pulsar observations . a critical in - depth review with details on the numerical method can be found in @xcite .",
    "masses of nss at birth are tuned by the intricate details of the astrophysical processes that drive core collapse and supernova explosions @xcite . a careful analytical treatment of the uncertainties that affect the chandrasekhar mass gives 1.081.57 as a reasonable range for the birth mass @xcite",

    "it is still unclear , however , whether very stiff equations of states ( eoss ) that stably sustain cores up to the gr limit ( @xmath29 ) can exist .",
    "the methods used for ns mass measurements have intrinsically different systematics , and therefore require a more careful treatment when assessing the underlying mass distribution .",
    "there is no compelling argument to have a single coherent ( unimodal ) mass distribution for nss that , we know , have gone through dissimilar evolutionary histories and possibly different physical processes that lead to their production @xcite . with an ever increasing number of pulsars with secure mass measurements , we have reached an adequate number by which we can now test whether the implied mass distributions are consistent with different sub - populations .",
