    "a nice link between such investigations and a genuine information theoretical viewpoint comes from the study of figures of merit such as entanglement in relation to critical properties of interacting many - body systems dragged across a quantum phase transition ( qpt)@xcite . the increasing interest in the understanding of general quantum correlations@xcite and their distinctive features that often depart from those characterizing the latter motivate a research aiming at establishing a connection between statistical properties of quantum many - body systems and general quantum correlations .",

    "we demonstrate the behavior of such correlations as a function of the transverse magnetic field when changing the number of spins in the ring . very interestingly , we show that , while tests for multipartite non - locality fail to reveal the modifications occurring within the system at criticality@xcite , global quantum correlations quite efficiently witness the occurrence of a qpt .",

    "@xmath82 with @xmath83 indicating the only non - zero elements of the density matrix . in this case , differently from what occurs for general two - qubit states , a semi - closed analytic formula for the evaluation of @xmath84 is available@xcite ( notice that @xmath85 can be easily calculated with the very same formula by first applying a swap gate to @xmath79 ) .",
    "while we point the reader to ref.@xcite for full details on this , here it is enough to mention that we have used such formula for the calculations reported in our work , thoroughly checking the corresponding predictions with an exact numerical approach . as for mid",

    "one can ascribe such a striking inconsistency of results to the fact that , for such a class of states , the reduced single - spin states are proportional to the identity operator @xmath33 .",

    "as soon as @xmath96 , the balance between such two state components is lost and a proper basis of reduced eigenprojectors can indeed be found .",
    "nevertheless , mid quite considerably tops both @xmath50 and @xmath87 .",
    "this demonstrates that mid fails to capture the genuine content of quantum correlations even in such a simple two - qubit state and , as such , does not embody a faithful figure of merit for our investigation .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath87 provides a much more reliable test , being strictly faithful on classical - classical states and only slightly overestimating the symmetrized discord ( it should be stressed that the differences between such measures rise from the fact that they address two different questions , from an operational viewpoint ) .    as it will be clarified later on , the main point of our analysis is the global content of quantum correlations in the ground state of the ising ring .",
    "although an extension of amid to the multipartite scenario is certainly possible , and is quite naturally entailed in the structure of such a figure of merit , the availability of a global quantum discord as a plausible multi - spin indicator and the fact that @xmath87 only constitutes an upper bound to quantum discord push us to consider the latter as our key tool for the remainder of our analysis .     and 8 spins ( from top to bottom curve ) against the magnetic field @xmath3 . in the inset",

    "the valence of such a configuration of parameters is quite understandable as it corresponds to the region where the correlation length across the ring diverges .",
    "moreover , using an analysis based on the first derivative of concurrence and discord with respect to @xmath3@xcite , it has been predicted that criticality emerges at @xmath99 .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the special nature of this region extends to global general quantum correlations .",

    "as anticipated , we make use of the global quantum discord proposed in ref.@xcite . when approaching the evaluation of @xmath102 , one faces the problem encompassed by the calculation of the relative entropy between the ground state @xmath103 of the ring and its locally - projected version . for large rings , this could be computationally demanding , let alone the necessity of a global optimization over any possible local projective basis .",
    "we thus break the calculation in a few intermediate steps and algebraic rearrangements that help us in streamlining the evaluation of @xmath102 .",

    "we have studied the behavior of general quantum correlations shared by the elements of a spin system governed by a transverse ising model under the influences of a collective magnetic field .",
    "our approach was multifaceted : on one hand , we aimed at showing that some degree of care is required in the choice of the indicator of non - classicality in such a model .",
    "naive choices dictated by the easiness of calculation implied by basis - dependent figures of merit may well lead to misleading physical conclusions . on the other hand ,",
    "we have embarked in a quantitative investigation on the content of multipartite quantum correlations across the spins of a given ring prepared in its collective ground state , finding that the deep structural changes occurring close to the ring s critical point are well revealed by a multipartite extension of quantum discord .",
    "such conclusions have been confirmed by a statistical analysis of the way entanglement is distributed across a ring of a set size : the variance of such distribution agrees in an excellent way with the predictions of global discord , while the average degree of entanglement is basically oblivious to criticality , similarly to the behavior of non - locality indicators for the very same system@xcite . our analysis paves the way to a more extensive study addressing thermally - affected states and aiming at relating the behavior of global discord to the most intimate statistical properties of the spin system studied here@xcite .",
