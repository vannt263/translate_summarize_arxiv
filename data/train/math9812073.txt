    "when considering a partially ordered set with infinitely many elements , one should wonder whether it contains an infinite antichain ( that is , a subset in which each pair of elements are incomparable ) .",
    "it is well known that all antichains of @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 if and only if @xmath2 for @xmath3 ) are finite .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "another basic result is that all antichains of the partially ordered set of the finite words of a finite alphabet are finite , where @xmath4 if one can delete some letters from @xmath5 to get @xmath6 .",
    "( this result is due to higman and can be found in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine this question for the partially ordered set @xmath7 of finite permutations with the following @xmath8 relation : if @xmath9 is less than @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a permutation of the set @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a permutation of the set @xmath14 , then @xmath15 if and only if we can delete @xmath16 elements from @xmath13 so that when we re - name the remaining elements according to their rank , we obtain @xmath17 .",
    "for example , @xmath18 as we can delete 4 and 1 from the latter to get @xmath19 , which becomes @xmath20 after re - naming .",
    "another way to view this relation is that @xmath21 if there are @xmath16 elements of @xmath22 that we can delete so that the @xmath23-th smallest of the remaining elements preceeds exactly @xmath24 elements , where @xmath24 is the number of elements preceeded by @xmath23 in @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath23-th smallest remaining entry of @xmath13 preceeds the @xmath25-th one if and only if @xmath23 preceeds @xmath25 in @xmath11 . in short ,",
    "@xmath26 if @xmath11 is `` contained '' in @xmath13 , that is , there is a subsequence in @xmath13 in which any two entries relate to each other as the corresponding entries in @xmath11 .",
    "we would like to point out that any answer to this question would be somewhat surprising .",
    "if there were no infinite antichains in this partially ordered set , that would be surprising because , unlike the two partially ordered sets we mentioned in the first paragraph , @xmath7 is defined over an infinite alphabet and the `` size '' of its elements can be arbitrarily large . on the other hand , if there is an infinite antichain , and we will find one , then it shows that this poset is more complex in this sense than the poset of graphs ordered by the operations of edge contraction and vertex deletion .",
    "( that this poset of graphs does not contain an infinite antichain is a famous theorem of robertson and seymour  @xcite ) .",
    "this is surprising too , as graphs are usually much more complex than permutations .",
    "we are going to construct an infinite antichain , @xmath27 .",
    "the elements of this antichain will be very much alike ; in fact , they will be identical at the beginning and at the end .",
    "their middle parts will be very similar , too .",
    "these properties will help ensure that no element is contained in another one .",
    "let @xmath28 .",
    "we view @xmath29 as having three parts : a decreasing sequence of length three at its beginning , a long alternating permutation starting with the maximal element of the permutation and ending with the entry 7 at the fifth position from the right ( in this alternating part odd entries have only even neighbors and vice cersa .",
    "moreover , the odd entries and the even entries form two decreasing subsequences so that @xmath30 is between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , and a terminating subsequence 3 2 1 5 .    to get @xmath33 from @xmath34 , simply insert two consecutive elements right after the maximum element @xmath9 of @xmath34 , and give them the values @xmath35 and @xmath36 . then make the necessary corrections to the rest of the elements ,",
    "that is , increment all old entries on the left of @xmath9 ( @xmath9 included ) by two and leave the rest unchanged ( see figure  [ fig : general ] ) .",
    "we claim that the @xmath34 form an infinite antichain .",
    "assume by way of contradiction that there are indices @xmath37 so that @xmath38 .",
    "how could that possibly happen ?",
    "first , note that the rightmost element of @xmath39 must map to the rightmost element of @xmath34 , since this is the only element in @xmath39 preceeded by four elements less than itself .",
    "similarly , the maximal element of @xmath39 must map to the maximal element of @xmath34 , since , excluding the rightmost element , this is the only element preceeded by three smaller elements .",
    "this implies that the first four and the last six elements of @xmath39 must be mapped to the first four and last six elements of @xmath34 , thus none of them can be deleted .",
    "therefore , when deleting elements of @xmath39 in order to get @xmath34 , we can only delete elements from the middle part , @xmath40 .",
    "we have already seen that the maximum element can not be deleted .",
    "suppose we can delete a set @xmath41 of entries from @xmath42 so that the remaining pattern is @xmath34 . first note that @xmath41 can not contain three consecutive elements , otherwise every element before those three elements would be larger than every element after them , and @xmath34 can not be divided in two parts with this property .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 can not contain two consecutive elements in which the first is even .",
    "thus @xmath41 can only consist of separate single elements ( elements whose neighbors are not in @xmath41 ) and consecutive pairs in which the first element is odd .",
    "clearly , @xmath41 can not contain a separate single element as in that case the middle part of resulting permutation would contain a decreasing 3-subsequnce , but the middle part , @xmath43 , of @xmath34 does not . on the other hand , if @xmath41 contained two consecutive elements @xmath6 and @xmath5 so that @xmath6 is odd , then the odd element @xmath44 on the right of @xmath5 would not be in @xmath41 as we can not have three consecutive elements in @xmath41 , therefore @xmath44 would be in the remaining copy of @xmath34 and @xmath44 would nt be preceeded by two entries smaller than itself . this is a contradiction as all odd entries of @xmath43 have this property .",
