    "amorphous solids are ubiquitous in nature and in technology , spanning well known materials from obsidian to metallic glasses .",
    "they are typically obtained by fast cooling a liquid such that it glides over the melting point where normally it can form a crystalline solid via a standard first - order phase transition .",
    "rather , the fluid becomes super - cooled and experiences that so - called glass transition where its relaxation time becomes ever longer upon decreasing the temperature @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 we have typically a frozen amorphous structure which appears to react elastically to small strains . in this paper we consider only amorphous solids that are made of @xmath3 point particles in @xmath4 dimensions , in a volume @xmath5 , which interact with each other via finite range interactions .",
    "the subject of our investigation is how athermal amorphous solids react to external strains .",
    "the potential energy in our strained amorphous solids can be written as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the positions of the particles and @xmath8 is the applied strain . in this paper",
    "we shall treat the strain as a scalar , all equations can be written in full tensorial form if required ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but for our purposes a single scalar strain @xmath8 will be sufficient .    for normal crystalline solids",
    "there is a rich literature spanning decades and centuries of studies of their elastic properties .",
    "it is well known that for small external strains @xmath8 normal solids react elastically to create an opposed stress @xmath9 .",
    "for very small external strains the stress is linear in the strain , with the coefficient of proportionality being the shear modulus @xmath10 .",
    "choosing an equilibrium reference state at @xmath11 the stress resulting from a small strain thus reads @xmath12 for higher strains the elastic response becomes nonlinear , and we denote , for the purpose of the discussion below , the nonlinear coefficients as @xmath13 with @xmath14 ( that is to say , by convention @xmath15 ) .",
    "we thus write for large strains @xmath16 for perfect monatomic crystalline solids the elastic theory is entirely transparent since both the linear and the nonlinear coefficients in this expansion can be computed directly from the change in system energy as a function of the strain , @xmath17 ( the so - called born term , and see below for details ) .",
    "when the crystalline solid becomes riddled with defects , the nature of the elastic theory becomes much more obscure , since the born term does not tell the whole story . in amorphous solids deviations from the born approximation",
    "are inevitable .",
    "any strain is bound to bring about , in addition to an affine transformation in the position of the particles , also non - affine transformations that are necessary to bring back the system to a mechanical equilibrium in which the net force @xmath18 on every particle is zero .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental assumption that is equivalent to the assertion that a piece of material is a solid , is that before any plastic deformation takes place , the potential can be expanded in powers of the strain to derive the various expressions for the stress , shear modulus and higher nonlinear elastic coefficients .    in the following we consider deformations via parameterized transformations on",
    "the particle coordinates @xmath19 where @xmath20 determines the imposed deformation @xcite , @xmath21 where the non - affine coordinates @xmath22 are additional displacements that guarantee that the mechanical equilibrium constraint is fulfilled .",
    "total derivatives with respect to strain in the athermal limit should thus satisfy the zero - forces constraint @xcite : @xmath23 where the second equality results from from eq .",

    "the conditions of mechanical equilibrium is used further in asserting that the amorphous solid remains in mechanical equilibrium also after straining ( but before any plastic event takes place ) . thus @xmath26 using the notation for the mismatch forces @xmath27 and the non - affine velocities @xmath28 we can rewrite eq .",

    "( [ mu ] ) @xmath34 is the affine born contribution to the shear modulus while the second term represents the * reversible * non - affine contribution to the shear modulus due to the motion of the atoms in the amorphous solid finding new equilibrium sites after being strained by an affine transformation .",
    "we should stress that until now the strain remains reversible in the sense that reducing @xmath8 back to zero ( or to @xmath35 if that was the reference state ) returns all the coordinates @xmath36 to their reference value .    examining the expression for the shear modulus , eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , we note that it contains a contraction of the inverse of the hessian matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the existence of eigenmodes associated with vanishing small eigenvalues of the hessian @xmath38 will result in a singularity in @xmath37 , which in turn may lead to singularities in the shear modulus .",
    "we stress here that we always consider the inverse hessian after removing the goldstone modes .",
    "we will show in the following that higher order elastic coefficients consist of terms containing an increasing number of contractions of @xmath37 , which can thus lead to increasingly higher order singularities .",
    "there are two main physical reasons for the existence of low - lying modes in amorphous solids .",
    "first , it is well known that with increasing system size , one finds low lying delocalized modes , for example in the form of plane waves with wave - vector of the order of @xmath39 , with associated eigenvalues @xmath40 which can be estimated as @xmath41    in addition to the existence of low lying delocalized modes , there exist plastic events , which are understood as a mechanical instability in amorphous systems @xcite .",
    "when a plastic event occurs at some value of the external strain @xmath42 , it is manifested as a saddle node bifurcation , with the lowest eigenvalue , denoted as @xmath43 , vanishing like @xmath44 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that when @xmath45 then @xmath46 ; plastic events occur at smaller and smaller values of the strain as the system increases in size .",
    "this important finding is reiterated below in sect .",
    "[ gammap ] .",
    "this inevitable proximity of mechanical instabilities is therefore the second reason for the existence of low - lying modes , and below we will show that it is in fact the most dangerous one .",
    "the question we address in this paper is how the shear modulus @xmath10 and higher order elastic moduli @xmath13 scale in the thermodynamic limit @xmath45 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in athermal amorphous media , by directly analyzing the effect of low - lying modes through their corresponding statistics .",
    "the analytic estimates are then validated against numerical simulations of model glass formers , both in two and three dimensions .",
    "the first point to be made is that because of the amorphous nature of the quenched solid , the various elastic moduli are random variables and are therefore characterized by their expectation values , their fluctuations , or more fully by their probability distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "we need to know whether these pdf s collapse to a delta function in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if not , are the pdf s attaining a limit function in the thermodynamic limit , or are the fluctuations divergent in this limit . it will turn out that @xmath10 exists in the thermodynamic limit and its distribution attains a delta function . on the other hand ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath0 does not collapse and remains wide , independently of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath1 and all higher coefficients will be shown to diverge ; they do not exist at all in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we stress that these consideration are entirely orthogonal to questions raised , say in ref .",
    "@xcite where is was argued that amorphous glassy systems at _ finite temperatures _ can always flow if we wait sufficiently long .",
    "the present analysis has nothing to do with temperature fluctuations or with long time scales .",
    "our findings are also fundamentally different from those conveyed in ref .  @xcite where it was shown that for a solid that contains a crack the series ( [ sigofgam ] ) has a zero radius of convergence .",

    "[ plasticmodes ] we present an analysis of the effect of localized plastic modes on the elastic coefficients .",
    "we show that these modes do not lead to the divergence of the shear modulus in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , they do lead to enormous fluctuations in @xmath0 - its pdf is predicted to attain a limit distribution that does not narrow upon increasing the system size . in addition , we predict and exemplify that the plastic modes lead to a divergence in the mean of @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit , concluding that it does not exist .",

    "any residual heat was removed by a potential energy minimization .",
    "we deformed our systems using the athermal quasi - static ( aqs ) scheme described in detail in @xcite .",
    "elastic coefficients were calculated using the prescriptions and microscopic expressions given in @xcite .",
    "the shear modulus was calculated exactly in eq .  ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "it contains two terms , the born term and the consequence of the non - affine field @xmath72 .",
    "the born term is always finite , being a straightforward partial derivative of the energy ( this remark pertains to the born terms @xmath73 in all the higher order elastic coefficients as well ) . on the other hand , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) which is due to the non - affine response , contains the contraction of @xmath37 which can be potentially singular .",
    "the higher order elastic coefficients have more terms that result from the non - affine response , but it is always easy to identify which is the potentially most divergent term . in the following section , we will consider the expressions for the most singular terms of the @xmath49th order elastic coefficients , denoted @xmath74 , which are the terms containing the * largest * number of contractions with @xmath37 .",

    "it is the latter one which is potentially most singular , and we focus on that term in the sequel .    to derive the most singular terms @xmath74 of @xmath13 , one can take consecutive total derivatives of the most divergent part of @xmath10 with respect to the external strain .",
    "the technical tool to do so is derived by taking the total derivative ( [ oper ] ) with respect to strain of the equation @xmath76 , then one obtains the relation @xcite @xmath77 where we have introduced the third - rank tensor @xmath78 .",

    "( [ invhesder ] ) contains a total of * three * contractions of @xmath37 , as opposed to only one contraction in the first term .",
    "so it is the second term @xmath79 that gives rise to the most singular terms which are considered below .    using eq .",

    "similarly we will denote localized plastic modes as @xmath90 , and their associated eigenvalues as @xmath91 .",

    "( [ d1 ] ) and  ( [ d3tens ] ) .",
    "the above points are consistent with the symmetry to flipping @xmath108 that require that for even @xmath49 @xmath109 .",
    "one should note that although @xmath13 are defined as the @xmath49th total derivatives of stress with respect to strain , the most singular terms contain at most a third derivative of the potential energy with respect to coordinates .",
    "this stems from the fact that the most singular terms contain the highest number of contractions with @xmath37 ; dimensional consideration then limit the order of the energy derivatives with respect to coordinates to third order .",
    "this is the order that contributes since the first order derivative vanishes due to mechanical equilibrium , and the second order is the hessian itself which annuls @xmath37 .",

    ", we calculate @xmath214 consequently @xmath215 is predicted to diverge in the thermodynamic limit , leading to the divergence of the third order elastic coefficients @xmath1 .",
    "needless to say , higher order coefficients will display stronger divergences , and will not exist in the thermodynamic limit .    turning again to the numerics ,",
    "we measured the most singular terms @xmath198,@xmath83 and @xmath84 for each member of our ensemble of quenched amorphous solids , both in 2d and 3d .",
    "for each member of the ensemble we computed these objects directly from their definitions ( [ d1 ] ) - ( [ d3tens ] ) . due to the amorphous nature of our solid , each member of the ensemble provides a different value to the measured quantity .",
    "the distributions of @xmath198 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ b1dist ] ; as predicted , they show no anomalies , and their width decay with increasing system size , as expected from an intensive thermodynamic variable .",

    "as required from isotropy , the distributions are symmetric around zero , and @xmath216 . as predicted",
    ", the width of the distribution remains @xmath3 independent ( or decreases extremely slowly ) , meaning that the fluctuations over realizations of @xmath83 do not decay appreciably with increasing the system size , in spite the intensive nature of the elastic coefficients .    in fig .",

    "we have learned in this paper that in amorphous solids of the type discussed above the elastic theory exists only for infinitesimal strains in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have found that the shear modulus exists in the thermodynamic limits , but starting with @xmath0 the pdf s of all the nonlinear coefficients @xmath13 do not converge to a delta - function in the thermodynamic limit . starting with @xmath1 all",

    "the final result can be summarized by the prediction @xmath220 note that the exponent @xmath203 is not expected to be universal since it depends on the quenching protocol and other details of the system .",
    "we expect however quite generally that @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "thus the shear modulus exists always , providing us with a small linear regime where elasticity theory may remain useful .",
    "we reiterate here that the analysis presented here has nothing to do with time - scales . as long as our",
    "straining rate is slow enough , @xmath222 the formation of an affine transformation is co - temporal with the creation of forces on the particles that result in a concurrent non affine transformation which is the source of potential singularities in the theory .",
    "one can not ` freeze ' the non affine part of the transformation and go on straining .",
    "the ` velocity ' @xmath72 above is real , and represents how the non affine transformation occurs on the same time scale that the strain is increased .",
    "the upshot of the analysis presented above is that in amorphous solids in the thermodynamic limit it is impossible to separate elastic from plastic responses .",
    "they are mixed together in an intimate way , defying the existence of a naive nonlinear elastic theory in the form of a taylor expansion .",
    "it is possible that one needs to renormalize the theory in order to obtain a well posed expansion in another variable ; this possibility will be explored in a forthcoming publication . at this point",
    "our feeling is that the results presented above explain the surprisingly high degree of plasticity that was found in recent experiments on metallic glasses @xcite , and of the fact that macroscopic samples of metallic glasses can not be maintained in the elasto - plastic steady state that is found in small sample simulations @xcite : they appear to break as soon as they reach the yielding transition .",
    "also , we point out to the interesting experiments @xcite where it was shown that in nano - samples of metallic particles one _ could _ reach the elasto - plastic steady state . while not mathematically related to the analysis shown in this paper , we propose that all these observations are in accordance with the theoretical conclusions presented here",
    ". it may be worthwhile to examine systematically the system size dependence of the existence of the yielding transition to a steady elasto - plastic state in metallic glasses and other systems of the type presented here .",
