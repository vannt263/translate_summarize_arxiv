    "the magneto - electric ( me ) effect , i.e. the production of an electric polarization ( magnetic moment ) by application of a magnetic ( electric ) field , has been known for a long time .",
    "multiferroics , e.g. materials that show ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity coexisting , have also been known where spins and electric dipoles order at different temperatures .",
    "quite recently a new class of multiferroics has been found , in which the magnetism and ferroelectricity are strongly coupled ; e.g. , they order at the same temperature . for this effect , however , the magnetic structure can not be simple ferromagnetism or a collinear spin state ; the ( vector ) magnetization density must show spatial variation in its direction as , e.g. for a spiral spin state .",
    "i refer to the introductory paragraphs of several recent papers for a more detailed history and list of references .",
    "@xcite until very recently , the effect has been found in antiferromagnets , e.g. , simple spirals , with no net magnetic moment . in  @xcite , however , the magnetic structure of the material studied , cocr@xmath9o@xmath10 , is approximately a ferrimagnetic spiral ( there is a net moment ) .",
    "@xcite    the work of mostovoy  @xcite is a phenomenological theory ( see also  @xcite ) , whereas microscopic models exhibiting the effect are presented in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of the latter involve superexchange ( where electron hopping between magnetic ions involves an intervening oxygen ion ) . in",
    "@xcite the situation is considered where a nearest neighbor pair of magnetic ions has an inversion center at the mid - point , so that there is no dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction ( dmi )  @xcite ; the polarization comes from a distortion of electronic density without ionic or atomic displacements ; also the @xmath11 orbitals considered on each magnetic site are chosen to diagonalize the spin - orbit coupling ( _ intra - atomic _ so coupling ) , partially removing degeneracy of these orbitals .",
    "in contrast , the essential mechanism invoked in  @xcite depends on the existence of the dmi plus electron - lattice interactions and orbital degeneracy ( jahn - teller effect ) , and the polarization results from ionic displacements .",
    "it seems sensible to ask , is it necessary to consider such complicated models to obtain an essential understanding of this unusual me effect ?",
    "we present here a much simpler model which yields the effect , namely the electric dipole moment for a pair of magnetic sites ,  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath5 connects the sites a and b , and @xmath0 are the average spins at the sites .",
    "it is most closely related to that of  @xcite , in that it considers the interaction of two magnetic sites with a center of symmetry ( so there is no dmi ) . also , the source of the spatial variation of the ordered spin density is due to outside effects of spin - spin exchange interactions , as in  @xcite . the hopping is direct  there is no oxygen , and no ionic displacements or orbital degeneracies .",
    "it involves _",
    "inter_-atomic spin - orbit coupling , a mechanism different from the model of  @xcite ; it is obviously different from that of  @xcite .",
    "we add that these characteristics are more appropriate than the others for cocr@xmath9o@xmath10 , where there is no orbital degeneracy.@xcite    a further motivation is a difficulty with the work of  @xcite . in the 3d transition metal ions ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling @xmath13 is the smallest of the various energies , namely coulomb interactions , transfer or hopping integrals , and ( cubic ) crystal field splitting .",
    "but in  @xcite , @xmath13 is taken as essentially infinite : it is diagonalized , along with the crystal field , before the hopping energies are considered .",
    "this leads to a doublet ( @xmath14 ) and a higher energy quartet @xmath15 , and the quartet is dropped .",
    "this is probably the reason why @xmath3 does not show the expected vanishing when @xmath16 .",
    "our model does not have this difficulty .",
    "our simple model has two atoms or ions , a and b , lying on the x - axis ; each has an s - type orbital and 3 p - type orbitals lying an energy @xmath17 higher .",
    "also , there are two electrons , 1 per site .",
    "later we describe briefly the generalization to the case where each site has 3 @xmath11 electrons , as for cr@xmath18 on an octahedral site , appropriate to the b - sites in xcr@xmath9o@xmath10 , x = co , mn .    for our simple model",
    "we first constrain the 1-electron basis set ( including spin ) to make the average spins @xmath19 lie at particular angles in the x - y plane and make an angle @xmath1 between them .",
    "the 1-electron basis states are @xmath20 where the spin states are @xmath21 ( @xmath22 are the usual  up , down \" states along the z - direction . ) and we take @xmath23 as in fig .",
    "1 . this spin arrangement is chosen for simplicity .",
    "also , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the locations of atoms @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the origin is at the mid - point between the two atoms .",
    "finally the  radial \" functions @xmath29 and the one - electron potential @xmath30 are assumed to be invariant under @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 also being even in @xmath34 .",
    "we can allow hopping for any orbital to any orbital , although , again for simplicity , we assume no intra - site transition matrix elements , and that the intra - orbital coulomb repulsion is so large as to exclude such inter - site hopping .",
    "we include also the intra - site inter - orbital ( s - p ) coulomb repulsion @xmath35 .",
    "finally we include the essential hopping processes @xmath36 caused by the spin - orbit interaction @xmath37 with @xmath38 = ( momentum/@xmath39 , spin/@xmath39 ) .",
    "the crucial matrix elements are , e.g. , @xmath40 i ve put @xmath41 , etc .",
    "it is convenient to consider the spatial factor here , @xmath42 where @xmath43 . using the symmetry properties of @xmath44 stated above",
    ", one can see readily that all the quantities @xmath45 vanish except @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the required spin factors in  ( [ 4 ] ) are straightforwardly found to be @xmath48\\equiv\\xi_y.\\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will also need @xmath49    consider first the simplest case , @xmath50 , which implies @xmath51 .",
    "then we need only the term @xmath52 , which is seen to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is real ; further , there is no symmetry reason for this to vanish .",
    "thus the remaining so matrix element  ( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath55    the basic symmetry of the situation allows the assumption @xmath56 under @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that @xmath58 under @xmath57 , i.e. under @xmath59 .",
    "the above results plus hermiticity of @xmath60 give all the relevant matrix elements .",
    "because only the @xmath61 orbitals are connected to the ground state orbitals @xmath62 , we can drop the other p - states .",
    "this leaves four 1-electron states ,  ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath63 , and therefore six 2-electron states .",
    "we write them conveniently in terms of @xmath64 , which respectively , create an electron in states @xmath65 ; similarly for @xmath66 , etc . :",
    "@xmath67    our final simplification before writing down the hamiltonian @xmath68 is the hubbard - like assumption where hopping is a 1-electron operator , the essential contribution from the coulomb terms being the intra - site inter - orbital coulomb term @xmath35 .",
    "thus , in the basis @xmath69 , @xmath70 the real quantities @xmath71 are ordinary ( kinetic + coulomb ) hopping terms : @xmath72 hops @xmath73 to @xmath74 , @xmath75 hops @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite    let us calculate the electric dipole moment in perturbation theory , where all hoppings are small .",
    "a non - zero value occurs in first order , surprising to us , having expected the dipole moment to come from _",
    "intra_-atomic mixing of s - like and p - like orbitals ( but this occurs in higher order only ) .",
    "the ground state wave function to 1st order can be picked off from the first column of @xmath68 ,  ( [ 11 ] ) , and using the unperturbed energy of the doubly - occupied sites : @xmath78 the dipole moment operator is @xmath79 . to 1st order , one needs the results @xmath80 where @xmath81 note that @xmath82 has dimensions of length .",
    "the x and z components of @xmath3 vanish by symmetry .",
    "it is instructive to consider the electron density , @xmath84 where the  overlap density \" is @xmath85 thus the charge density responsible for the dipole moment exists mainly between the two sites .",
    "note that the result @xmath86 as @xmath8 , as expected .",
    "we now generalize to the case where @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively make angles @xmath89 and @xmath90 with the positive x - axis , and remain in the x - y plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spinconfiguration ] ) .",
    "we will see that the dipole moment is independent of @xmath89 .",
    "but the non - vanishing of @xmath91 forces consideration of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , due to  ( [ 4 ] ) and the above statement that @xmath94 .",
    "thus the number of necessary 1-electron states is increased from 4 to 6 , increasing the number of 2-electron states to 15 .",
    "nevertheless , it is again quite simple to write down the ground state to 1st order in the hopping terms , yielding the generalization of  ( [ 12 ] ) , which in turn gives the electron density : @xmath95.\\label{23}\\ ] ] but from the definitions  ( [ 5 ] ) and  ( [ 6 ] ) , @xmath96 hence the term @xmath97 does nt enter , and so @xmath98 is irrelevant , and the result reduces to the previous expression  ( [ 17 ] ) .    to finish this consideration of the 2-site model",
    ", we consider the case where the two spins lie in the y - z plane , i.e. perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "then the spin states are @xmath99/\\sqrt2 , \\",
    "\\mu = a , b.\\ ] ] in this case one can easily see that @xmath100 are all real , so that  ( [ 23 ] ) says the dipole moment vanishes , again consistent with  ( [ 0 ] )",
    ".    now apply these results to a crystal where the spins form a spiral  @xcite @xmath101\\ ] ] for simplicity we can consider a cubic crystal and the propagation vector @xmath102 along a principle cubic direction , say x. then @xmath103 can be written @xmath104 , where @xmath1 is the spiral turn angle . by choosing @xmath105 , one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig : spinconfiguration ] that a spiral is generated by increasing @xmath106 by steps of unity .",
    "then the induced change in electron density in the bond @xmath107 is @xmath108 that is , the dipole moment in each bond is the same ( ferroelectric ordering ) , and the overlap density is merely the translation of this density from one bond to the next .      in summary ,",
    "the present microscopic model yields an electric dipole moment @xmath109 resulting from canted spins , in the direction of @xmath110 with the same dependence , @xmath111 , on the angle @xmath1 between the spins .",
    "when applied to a crystal with a simple spiral spin state , the @xmath6 component of @xmath3 is the same for each bond , yielding a ferroelectric state , just as in the previous closely related theory of katsura et al  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , however , our result @xmath86 as @xmath8",
    ".    we mention a very rough estimate of the size of the effect .",
    "we assume hydrogen 1s and 2p orbitals , r=3@xmath112 ( the cr - cr distance in cocr@xmath9o@xmath10 ) , @xmath113=2ev , and @xmath33 the potential energy of an electron in the field of 2 protons .",
    "we find the coefficient of @xmath111 in  ( [ 15 ] ) ( the dipole moment for one bond ) , to be @xmath114c - m ( coulomb - meters ) . assuming a simple cubic lattice with spiral propagation along a principle cubic direction , and a volume per site of @xmath115 , yields a polarization of @xmath116 , about an order of magnitude smaller than found  @xcite in cocr@xmath9o@xmath10 . in view of the crudeness of this estimate",
    ", it suggests that the mechanism is probably relevant to real materials .",
    "finally , we extended our model to the case where each site is like cr@xmath18 in an octahedral field ( b - site ) , the three 3d - electrons being in the high - spin state @xmath117 , as in co and mn chromite .",
    "the p - states are from the 4p shell . also note that the dominant b - b exchange interaction is direct , the superexchange being @xmath118  @xcite , suggesting that our simple model neglecting an intervening oxygen might be somewhat realistic for the b - b pairs in these spinels .",
    "our motivation is to check that our basic mechanism is robust in going to a more realistic model .",
    "the model hilbert space is now much larger .",
    "our basis functions are constructed as follows .",
    "the 3 @xmath11 orbitals are @xmath119 .",
    "similarly the p - orbitals are @xmath120 and @xmath121 are invariant under inversion , @xmath122 .",
    "the full 1-electron basis states are @xmath123 @xmath124 , etc .",
    "we again simplify somewhat by choosing the spin states @xmath125 as in  ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath126 create @xmath127 respectively , and similarly for @xmath128 .",
    "write these as @xmath129 , with @xmath130 corresponding to the t - states , @xmath131 to the p - states .    then the spin - orbit interaction is conveniently written @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "then the 6-electron basis states ( single determinants ) are @xmath134 for the hole vacuum @xmath135 , the @xmath136 are ordered @xmath137 .",
    "the ground state to 1st order in the overlap is then @xmath138 where the @xmath139 are the unperturbed energies .",
    "the terms that contribute to the electric dipole moment are the interatomic elements , e.g. @xmath140 most of the matrix elements of @xmath141 vanish by symmetry ; noting that the y - component of the spin matrix element @xmath91 vanishes ( by the choice of @xmath89 , as before ) , we need only the components @xmath142 .",
    "the only ones of these matrix elements that survive are @xmath143 plus 3 terms for @xmath144 .",
    "but in calculating @xmath3 , these matrix elements get multiplied by corresponding elements of the position or displacement operator as in @xmath145 , and many of the position matrix elements vanish by symmetry .",
    "it turns out that only the @xmath146 terms contribute , and the final result for the dipole moment is @xmath147 where @xmath148 thus the result is similar to the previous one  ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the terms , @xmath149 do not vanish by symmetry .",
    "thus we have confirmed that the basic mechanism , involving inter - atomic so coupling , gives the interesting me effect in this rather realistic model .",
