    "simulating the magnetic behavior of type ii superconductors requires solving maxwell s equations under specific material equations .",
    "many different models have been proposed for solving this task including energy minimization , variational , or more direct approaches ( e.g. refs . ) . when addressing not only the static , but also the dynamic behavior , it is often convenient to calculate the time evolution of field relevant quantities ( e.g. of the magnetic vector potential or of the induction ) directly .",
    "still , different approaches can be chosen .",
    "the most direct way is to solve maxwell s equations by integration ( i.e. with the help of the appropriate green s function ) which yields , e.g. , the current density or the vector potential.@xcite this method naturally leads to results fulfilling the electromagnetic boundary conditions at the sample surface .",
    "however , integrating over the whole sample volume requires a lot of calculation time and is usually too slow for three - dimensional ( 3d ) problems . for a grid of @xmath3 elements , into which the sample is divided for the numerics ,",
    "at least @xmath4 operations have to be performed per time step .",
    "the opposite approach deals with the differential form of maxwell s equations , where fields and currents are locally related by difference equations.@xcite this makes the calculations very fast inside the sample , since only about @xmath3 operations per time step are required .",
    "care has to be taken , however , with the boundary conditions at the surface , which requires solving the equations also outside the sample up to distances , where the influence of the sample can be neglected .    as a compromise ,",
    "we present a model , where the differential equations are applied to the sample interior , whereas the values at the sample boundaries are obtained by integrating over the sample volume yielding the correct boundary conditions .",
    "this requires @xmath5 operations .",
    "it was already demonstrated@xcite that the model worked sufficiently rapidly for 3d calculations on a standard pc .    in this paper",
    ", we provide details of the method and discuss examples relevant for every - day magnetometry measurements . in section [ sec : simulation ] the simulation procedure and some technical aspects of the implementation are described .",
    "we start with a general model , but concentrate in the following on rectangular samples , for which several tests were carried out .",
    "section [ sec : application ] is devoted to applications of the method to magnetometry ( e.g. squid or vsm ) measurements .",
    "we will verify the well known experimental evaluation of the critical current density from magnetization loops by applying bean s model and introduce a simple way of determining the superconducting volume fraction of a sample .",
    "our aim is to solve maxwell s equations relevant for the magnetic properties of a superconductor .",
    "we assume superconductors without ( non - superconducting ) para- or diamagnetic properties and initially ignore the reversible magnetization of the superconducting state .",
    "thus , maxwell s equations ( in si units ) for vacuum may be applied .",
    "@xmath6 the displacement current ( eq .  [ eqn : maxwell2 ] ) is not considered .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the magnetic induction , @xmath8tma@xmath9 the vacuum permeability , @xmath10 the current density and @xmath11 the electric field . generally , the vector quantities depend on time ( @xmath12 ) and position ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the electric field is usually explicitly provided , e.g. as a function of current density , induction , and material specific parameters such as the critical current density to specify the superconducting properties of the material .",
    "it is directed parallel to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the velocity of the vortices caused by the lorentz force @xmath16 . in the following",
    ", we will address rather simple configurations , relevant for most magnetometry experiments , where the currents flow perpendicular to @xmath7 and thus @xmath11 and @xmath10 are parallel .",
    "the more complicated situation , where @xmath10 has also a ( usually small ) component parallel to @xmath7 , which can occur in the case of arbitrary field directions or irregular sample geometries , etc . , is not considered .",
    "recently , this problem was solved for simple configurations in the ( static ) bean limit @xcite , but it is currently not establish how to obtain more general results . for the simpler examples , discussed here , different kinds of material equations are available in the literature , which describe different materials and experimental situations ( e.g. refs .  ) .",

    "our starting point is a convenient initial state of the magnetic induction @xmath25 and the corresponding current density @xmath26 ( satisfying @xmath27 ) .",
    "usually , we start with @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the whole sample or with the results of a previous simulation .",

    "* we end up with a new set of @xmath7 and @xmath10 , close our simulation loop and proceed with calculating the next @xmath11 ( step ii ) .",
    "figure [ fig : flow ] outlines the major parts of the sequence . after the last step ( vii ) specific quantities may be evaluated ( which is usually not done after each simulation loop , but after predefined field or time intervals ) , e.g. the magnetic moment @xmath41    thanks to the use of the difference equations , the simulations can be carried out quite rapidly .",
    "time - consuming integration over the whole sample volume is only necessary for the induction at the sample surface to provide the correct boundary values .",
    "we wish to point out another very attractive feature of this method , namely the fact , that the induction @xmath7 is directly assessed in the simulations .",
    "this makes it very convenient to apply any field dependent property - in particular a field dependent critical current density @xmath42 - without the need of any additional calculations of @xmath7 ( as would be necessary for many other approaches ) .",
    "different specifications of @xmath11 and @xmath36 allow dealing with different materials and experiments . for instance , the simple power law of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : powerlaw ] ) leads to the typical flux creep behavior of superconductors .",
    "a transport current can be considered by adding external electric fields .",
    "so far , only the irreversible properties have been addressed in the simulation procedure .",
    "a simple way of taking also the reversible magnetization of a superconductor into account is presented in ref .  , which can be easily adapted in our method by adding two further steps to the above procedure .",
    "* after finishing the last step ( vii ) of the original procedure , we know @xmath7 and @xmath10 in the entire sample .",
    "@xmath7 is the overall local magnetic induction and thus includes also the contribution from the reversible magnetization @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 the reversible behavior may be assessed from ginzburg landau theory or from simpler approximations ( like those of ref .  ) , which provide @xmath45 as a function of @xmath7 ( or @xmath46 ) and two parameters such as @xmath47 - the upper critical field - and @xmath48 - the ginzburg landau parameter .",

    "we mainly concentrate on samples with high critical current density , where the reversible properties may be ignored and therefore only steps ( i - vii ) will be executed .      in this section ,",
    "we address some specific points of our implementation . in most cases",
    ", we deal with rectangular samples and , therefore , subdivide the sample into small rectangular elements , within which the current density is kept constant . for simplicity",
    ", we work with an equidistant grid , but note that a better efficiency is expected from a grid with smaller elements near the surface , since most quantities typically exhibit larger variations there .",
    "each grid element consists of eight vertices and a central point ( fig .",

    "we point out that it is essential to calculate these integrals numerically very accurately .",
    "note , however , that @xmath75 depends only on the position vectors , hence the integrals need to be calculated just once during the initial stage , and can be stored for later use in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : hs_x]-[eqn : hs_z ] ) .",
    "finally , we address the problem of choosing an adequate time increment @xmath33 , which should be as large as possible to make the simulation time short , but small enough to have no influence on the results . in our implementation , it turns out that choosing @xmath33 too large makes the calculations unstable with @xmath76 increasing rapidly towards infinity .",
    "this situation can be easily monitored and mitigated by resuming the simulation from a previously saved configuration with a smaller @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out that even smaller values of @xmath33 do not modify the results .",
    "the model was successfully applied to fully 3d calculations in conveniently short simulation times , as reported in ref .  .",
    "in the following , we focus on magnetization loops of rectangular samples in the presence of an homogeneous external field , which occurs in most magnetometry experiments ( e.g. squid or vsm ) . the external field is applied in @xmath66 direction , perpendicular to the top and bottom surface of our sample , and we assume isotropic material parameters ( e.g. @xmath1 ) within the @xmath77 plane . in this case , the model may be simplified assuming the currents to flow exactly parallel to the nearest sample surfaces .",
    "the benefits of the procedure are still available in the 2 dimensional calculations , making it possible to simulate realistic magnetization loops very rapidly ( e.g. within about 1 to 10 minutes on a conventional standard pc ) .",
    "we point out that our assumption on the current flow is not rigorously valid ( see ref .  ) , but the deviations are only significant in very thin samples , which are not addressed here .    for the actual implementation , we assume the sample center to coincide with the point of origin and the lateral surfaces to be parallel to the @xmath64 or @xmath65 axis .",
    "the fields and currents need to be calculated only at the cross section spanned by the @xmath66 and @xmath65 axis , on which a 2d grid is defined .",
    "thus we apply almost the same procedure as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : element ] , but mapped on 2 dimensional elements ( i.e. the cross section of each 3d element - see fig .",
    "[ fig : element ] ) . the calculation of the surface field ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : hs_x ] - [ eqn : hs_z ] ) is slightly modified to @xmath78 with @xmath79 @xmath80 vanishes due to the symmetry of the system .",
    "the sums run over all 2 dimensional elements ( @xmath81 ) of the sample cross section .",
    "the integration is performed over one element ( @xmath81 ) and - for the third dimension - over the closed current loop , exactly parallel to the nearest sample surfaces .",
    "@xmath82 indicates the unit vector of the a - priori known current flow direction .",
    "thus @xmath83 can also be accurately calculated during the initial stage and stored for later use .",
    "several tests are available for verifying the output of the simulations .",
    "the first concerns @xmath84 , the lowest applied field of a virgin @xmath85 curve , at which the currents have penetrated the entire sample .",
    "it corresponds to the @xmath66-component of the field of that current distribution at the center of the sample , which is easily calculated for constant currents ( bean model , e.g. eq .  [ eqn : hsurface ] , but with @xmath86 ) .",
    "the simulations reveal @xmath84 by monitoring the current density at the sample center .",
    "the bean model is approximated by applying constant currents and - to reduce relaxation - a large @xmath19 value .",
    "as expected , the deviation of @xmath84 from the direct calculation is reduced with increasing @xmath19 value and almost vanishes ( smaller than 1% ) at @xmath87 .",
    "secondly , we can test the creep behavior of the currents by studying the relaxation of the magnetic moment .",
    "this time , the power law ( eq .  [ eqn : powerlaw ] ) was applied with a field dependent critical current density and a constant @xmath19 value ( @xmath88 ) . imitating the common experimental procedure , we started with simulating ( parts of ) a magnetization loop , followed by recording the relaxation in the fully penetrated state , i.e. the time dependence of the magnetic moment - @xmath89 - at constant applied field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relax]a ) . according to theory",
    "the @xmath19 value may be extracted via @xmath90 which matches very well ( @xmath91% deviation ) the input value of @xmath19 in the simulation ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : relax]a ) .",
    "a second way of studying relaxation is provided by the so - called dynamic relaxation , where magnetization loops are measured ( or simulated ) at different field sweep rates @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relax]b ) .",
    "the relaxation rate at constant applied field is now given by @xmath93 and is again found to be in good agreement ( @xmath94% deviation ) with our input value of @xmath19 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : relax]b ) .",
    "in the following we present two applications of the simulations to common problems of magnetometry experiments .",
    "the first refers to the evaluation of the critical current density from magnetization loops .",
    "usually the bean model is applied , which presumably leads to certain deviations from the correct @xmath1 behavior . to analyze these deviations quantitatively",
    "we start from a given @xmath2 behavior and simulate magnetization loops .",
    "then we apply the same evaluation procedure as used for the experimental data to reevaluate @xmath1 , which is finally compared with our input @xmath1 curve .",
    "we start by explaining the experimental procedure used in most experiments for acquiring @xmath95 from magnetometry measurements and introduce a simple extension that allows to obtain @xmath96 .",
    "when determining the critical current density from squid or vsm measurements we usually do not know more than the magnetic moment as a function of applied field , @xmath85 , and the sample dimensions @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , where we assume @xmath99 to be parallel to @xmath100 .",
    "thus , assumptions on @xmath1 are inevitable , which are in most cases a constant absolute value of @xmath10 equal to @xmath1 and a flow direction parallel to the nearest sample surfaces ( bean model ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath81 and @xmath1 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : moment ] ) leading to an analytic expression for rectangular samples in the fully penetrated state@xcite that can be solved for @xmath1 @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103 denotes the irreversible magnetic moment generated by the critical currents , which is given by half of the hysteresis width of the magnetization loop .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : jcbean ] ) leads to a first approximation of @xmath1 as a function of the applied field - @xmath95 . to come closer to the actual material property ,",
    "i.e. , the critical current density as a function of the magnetic induction - @xmath2 - ( which is independent of sample geometry ) , we additionally consider the field induced by the current distribution ( cf .",
    "for the case of cylindrical samples ) .",
    "since the magnetic moment acquired by the magnetometry measurements always refers to the whole sample volume , the induction needs to be averaged in the same way to obtain @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 with @xmath106 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hsurface ] ) , and @xmath107 the integral runs over the whole sample volume .",
    "@xmath108 represents a weighting factor , which corresponds to that of @xmath1 in the calculation of @xmath81 ( cf .",
    "[ eqn : moment ] ) and reflects also the distance from the current element to the pick - up coils of the magnetometry devices .",
    "@xmath109 is the integral of this factor over the sample volume .",
    "the weighting does not strongly affect the results , but is still significant for the behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "note further , that we evaluate @xmath1 as a function of the absolute value of the @xmath0 component parallel to the applied field ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "finally , we address the evaluation of @xmath103 .",
    "the experiments provide @xmath85 , which is usually the sum of @xmath103 and of the reversible magnetic moment @xmath111 .",
    "additional magnetic signals from the sample or the sample holder can usually be treated in a similar way as @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 is extracted from ( half of ) the difference of @xmath81 at increasing ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) and decreasing ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) fields at the same induction @xmath0 .",
    "but note that the two branches of @xmath85 refer to different values of @xmath0 at the same @xmath100 since the currents have opposite orientation in the two branches .",
    "two situations are distinguished .",
    "first , when the irreversible part dominates , as is the case in most experiments , @xmath0 is separately calculated for each branch of @xmath85 by applying eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : jcbean ] - [ eqn : bgesamt ] ) with @xmath117",
    ". then @xmath118 is obtained from @xmath119 and the final @xmath2 by evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jcbean ] ) again .",
    "in the second case , where the reversible parts are significant or even dominate , the critical current density is usually low and therefore the corresponding field correction ( @xmath120 ) small .",
    "accordingly , we start with evaluating @xmath121 $ ] , i.e. the irreversible magnetic moment from the hysteresis width at the same applied field , and then apply eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : jcbean ] - [ eqn : bgesamt ] ) for getting @xmath2 .",
    "the above experimental evaluation is not expected to result in the `` true '' @xmath2 curve .",
    "the main reason for discrepancies is the ( necessary ) assumption of a constant current density within the sample , which is not fulfilled in realistic materials , since @xmath0 may vary considerably and @xmath2 is usually not constant .",
    "accordingly , we expect more pronounced deviations , when the samples are large and have high @xmath1 , since both properties would enhance the ( peak to peak ) variation of @xmath0 within the sample . at low fields",
    "this variation is comparable with @xmath122 , which may amount to several tesla in typical `` squid or vsm '' samples . at higher fields ,",
    "we expect better agreement with the `` true '' @xmath1 , since @xmath1 becomes smaller and flatter as a function of @xmath0 in most cases .",
    "to get some idea of the quantitative differences between the `` true '' @xmath1 and @xmath1 from the above evaluation , we simulated a typical magnetometry measurement assuming a sample size of @xmath123mm@xmath124 , and a @xmath1 behavior described by @xmath125 setting @xmath126 t and @xmath127 roughly leads to a behavior observed in many ( melt textured ) y-123 ( y@xmath128ba@xmath129cu@xmath130o@xmath131 ) samples at low temperatures .",
    "@xmath132 = @xmath133am@xmath134 leads to @xmath135 t and a similarly large variation of @xmath0 in the sample .",
    "furthermore , we applied the power law ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : powerlaw ] ) with @xmath136vm@xmath9 and @xmath88 and a field sweep rate of @xmath137ts@xmath9 .",

    "this is done automatically by the evaluation program and includes the appropriate parts of the virgin curve ( i.e. for @xmath139 ) and those parts directly after reversing the field , where the currents have opposite orientation .",

    "@xmath142 shows significant deviations from @xmath2 at fields @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath141 , however , matches quite well despite the rather rough assumption of a constant current density in the sample ( note that the peak to peak variation of @xmath0 in the sample reaches 2.4 t at constant applied field in this specific simulation ) .",
    "slower field sweep rates or field - step measurements would shift the curves to slightly smaller values due to relaxation .",
    "note further that the evaluation method does not give access to @xmath1 at or close to @xmath144 , since the mean induction ( cf .",
    "[ eqn : hs_weighting ] ) is always larger than zero .    to get further insight",
    ", we repeated the procedure for different samples and @xmath2 curves ( e.g. with exponential behavior ) and found similarly good agreement as above .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : jcs]b shows results on a sample with dimensions @xmath145mm@xmath124 and the same @xmath2 as in the above example ( only @xmath18 is slightly adapted to account for the larger sample size ) .",
    "although @xmath146 of 4.4 t is quite large and @xmath142 starts to deviate from @xmath2 at a similarly high field , these deviations are again nicely corrected by @xmath141 .    analyzing situations with much larger @xmath146 does not make sense , since the evaluation of @xmath1 requires external fields larger than @xmath146 , but typical experimental devices do not provide fields much above 5 - 10 t .",
    "increasing @xmath2 instead of the sample size leads to similar effects .    as a final example , we show results on a sample with a size of @xmath147mm@xmath148 , which is representative for a typical single crystal geometry .",
    "we took the same @xmath2 behavior as in the above examples but with @xmath132 = @xmath149am@xmath134 , accordingly @xmath135 t .",
    "[ fig : jcs]c presents the results , which again demonstrate the excellent agreement between the evaluated @xmath141 and the input curve @xmath2 .",
    "the evaluation of the critical current density as described in the previous sections is only valid if the current flow is unimpeded over the whole sample .",
    "this is illustrated by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jcbean ] ) , which shows that a sample with dimensions @xmath150 would induce a larger magnetic moment than the sum of two samples with dimensions @xmath151 , with the same @xmath1 as the large sample .",
    "thus , grain boundaries and other macroscopic inhomogeneities ( e.g. normal conducting inclusions ) , which impede the current flow , would lead to an underestimation of @xmath1 , when applying the above method .",
    "a similar effect is caused by overestimating the superconducting sample volume , e.g. when the material properties are degraded at the surface .",
    "we further note , that magnetization measurements are not only used for evaluating @xmath1 , but also for determining all kinds of superconducting parameters , such as the critical magnetic fields or the characteristic lengths , etc .",
    "( e.g. ref .   ) .",
    "most of these quantities are derived from the magnetization , @xmath152 , i.e. , it is again important to exactly know the volume ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we point out that both surface degradation and grain boundaries were even found in samples believed to be single crystals . in the following",
    "we show that the reverse branch of a magnetization loop is very sensitive to such imperfections , and that we can prove whether or not a sample is single grained , and even detect , if parts of the surface are degraded .",
    "we started our analysis with experimental magnetization loops of a y-123 sample at 30k .",
    "the size of the rectangular sample was precisely measured with an optical microscope and found to be @xmath154 mm , @xmath155 mm , and @xmath156 mm .",
    "using these data , @xmath2 was calculated with the above method ( section [ sec : experimentaleval ] ) , and the result was used for simulating the magnetization loops . as expected , there is agreement with experiment over most part of the field range .",
    "small differences are only observed near @xmath157 , since @xmath1 close to @xmath144 needs to be extrapolated .",
    "we are , however , not interested in this region , but look closer to that part of the reverse branch of the loop , where currents with opposite orientation flow in the sample ( indicated by the two arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) and which had been disregarded for evaluating @xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] there is perfect agreement between experiment ( open circles ) and simulation ( solid line , @xmath158 mm ) even in this part of the loop , thus demonstrating that the size of the sample surface had been determined correctly and that the sample is pretty homogeneous for the macroscopic current flow . comparing only the magnetization slope",
    "directly after the reversal point ( up - arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) provides information on the sample size and surface , but not on the interior since the newly penetrating currents ( which have opposite orientation with respect to the existing currents ) flow only at the sample surface . with decreasing applied field ,",
    "the new currents penetrate into the sample and as soon as the current front reaches a region with a different @xmath1 ( e.g. at a grain boundary or a normal conducting inclusion ) the macroscopic current path and therefore also the magnetic moment would start to deviate from the simulations ( where perfect homogeneity is assumed ) . in addition , the field , where the new currents arrive at the center ( down - arrow in fig .  [ fig : revleg ] ) , would be different . to conclude , only comparing experiment and simulation over the whole penetration interval ( i.e. form the up- to the down - arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) can clarify if samples are homogeneous ( at least for the current flow ) over the whole volume .",
    "let us assume that the measurement of the sample size had resulted in slightly larger values , namely @xmath159 mm and @xmath160 mm , i.e. only 0.05 mm for both lengths , which increases the volume by about 9% .",
    "we repeated the whole procedure with these data ( which leads to a slightly smaller @xmath1 ) and find again agreement on most parts of the @xmath85 loops .",
    "however , inspecting the reverse branch more closely , we find significant disagreement between the two arrows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) , i.e. where not all currents are equally oriented , which demonstrates different sample sizes .",
    "this indicates either an error in the measurement of the sample size , or the fact that small regions of the lateral surfaces are non - superconducting .",
    "while a smaller @xmath1 hardly affects the slope of @xmath85 close to the reversal point , the larger sample size and the correspondingly larger current loop enhances the ( absolute value of the ) slope by about 10% as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ( note that @xmath84 also increases ) .",
    "secondly , we studied the case of a sample divided into two independent grains ( bicrystal ) with sizes @xmath161mm@xmath162 ( i.e. @xmath163 ) . since the relative contribution of the critical currents to the magnetic field is small at high applied field , any interaction between the two grains ( i.e. magnetic fields from the other grain )",
    "was neglected .",
    "having the same overall magnetic moment ( which is simply the sum of @xmath81 from the two grains ) leads to a larger @xmath1 than in the large ( single grained ) sample .",
    "as expected , the slope of @xmath164 ) at the reversal point is significantly flatter in the bicrystal ( about 17% ) than in the single grain sample ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) making it easy to distinguish between the different situations .",
    "finally , we compare our results on the slope of the reverse branch with the well known analytical expression given by angadi et al@xcite , i.e. d@xmath165 , with @xmath166 and @xmath167 the radius of a cylinder which has the same surface area as the cuboid . using this method results in a slope that deviates from simulation and experiment by only about 5% ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : revleg ] ) .",
    "however , applying the same method to the bicrystal leads to a slope that actually matches the exact result of the single grain sample even better .",
    "thus , this approximation can not be recommended to verify if samples are single grained or decomposed into a few grains .",
    "details of a simple method for two or three dimensional simulations of the current dynamics in a superconductor have been presented .",
    "solving the differential form of maxwell s equations in the sample interior makes the calculations very fast .",
    "the integral form is only used at the sample surfaces to meet the correct boundary conditions .",
    "the procedure results in the time and position dependence of the magnetic induction and the critical current density , which makes it very convenient to apply field dependent material parameters , like @xmath2 .",
    "the method allows simulating different kinds of experiments , like magnetization loops , static and dynamic relaxation measurements , etc .",
    ", in which also the reversible superconducting properties may be considered .    to demonstrate the potential of the method , we presented two examples , which are important for standard magnetometry measurements . in the first",
    ", magnetization loops were simulated by applying a given @xmath2 and then evaluated by the methods usually applied to experimental data , i.e. the bean model .",
    "comparison of the given @xmath2 and the bean @xmath2 shows good agreement even for large samples and high @xmath1 , if the bean result is corrected by a simple numerical expression .",
    "secondly , we showed that surface degradations , which reduce the superconducting volume fraction of a sample , or inhomogeneities like grain boundaries , which influence the current flow , can be detected by carefully comparing the magnetization loops from experiment and simulation at regions , where currents with opposite orientation flow in the sample ."
