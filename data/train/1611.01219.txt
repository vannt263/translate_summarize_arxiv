    "<S> this can be done by coupling an extra off - resonant readout mode to the same junction . </S>",

    "<S> typical superconducting cavities have impedances @xmath107 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , much larger impedances @xmath108 have been produced using devices comprising superinductances ( fabricated from arrays of large josephson junctions ) , such as in the fluxonium qubit @xcite .    in our proposed experimental system </S>",

    "<S> . it may be worthwhile to realize @xmath114 , and this could be achieved by circuits similar to those proposed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this transforms the effective cavity impedance according to @xmath115 , making the relation @xmath44 much easier to satisfy . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this strategy will be described in a forthcoming publication .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now study the limitations of such a measurement protocol . </S>",
    "<S> here we have made a few approximations and the main limitations are due to second order effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first one concerns the rwa . indeed , dealing with high - impedance modes one needs to be cautious about higher order resonances . </S>",
    "<S> while in the single - mode case , such second - order effects lead to a slight modification of the measurement rate , in the two - mode case , they could lead to a small dephasing within the parity subspaces ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these effects could be minimized by a careful choice of resonance frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> another limitation concerns the zeno approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered that under the two - photon process , the confined dynamics is given by the projected hamiltonian @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a first order zeno dynamics approximation in @xmath116  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second order correction in @xmath117 induces a dephasing in the basis @xmath118 occurring at a rate @xmath119 , where the numerical factor @xmath120 can be derived from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this could be seen as an inefficiency in the measurement , where a constant part ( independent of the number of readout photons ) of the measurement signal is lost through the two - photon decay channel . here </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze numerically this second order effect by simulating the master equation @xmath121+\\kappa_{2ph}{\\textbf{d}}[{\\textbf{a}}^2-\\alpha^2](\\rho)\\ ] ] where the single mode hamiltonian , @xmath52 , is given by  ( [ eq : rwahamiltonian ] ) and @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath123 , and varying @xmath47 and the zeno parameter @xmath117 , we look at the decay of purity with time </S>",
    "<S> . this corresponds to a dephasing due to higher order zeno dynamics well - approximated by @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qndness ] ( dashed lines corresponding to the right axis ) the value of @xmath125 corresponding to the measurement efficiency when the number of readout photons is fixed to @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as @xmath124 does not depend on the number of readout photons while @xmath127 increases linearly in @xmath93 , this efficiency improves for higher number of readout photons . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that for a given zeno parameter @xmath117 , the point @xmath128 corresponding to the optimal measurement rate @xmath127 , is also a local optimum of the efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we do not account for the readout mode @xmath91 in these simulations , as it does not contribute to higher - order zeno approximations and therefore to @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , this measurement inefficiency is the only detrimental effect of such higher - order dynamics . as the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 is diagonal in the fock states basis , it does not change the parity and therefore do not lead to any bit - flip type error of the logical qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> we can perform a similar analysis for the two - mode joint - parity measurement protocol . while higher order zeno dynamics can not lead to any change of photon number parities ( hamiltonian is diagonal in the fock states basis ) , in principle , it can lead to a dephasing for each logical qubit . </S>",
    "<S> however , to a very good approximation ( exponentially precise in @xmath2 ) , such a dephasing occurs in a correlated manner , giving rise to a dissipation channel of the form @xmath129 ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that such higher order effects do not induce any decoherence within a given joint - parity subspace . therefore starting from @xmath130 , </S>",
    "<S> the measurement will project the state on one of the two parity states @xmath131 or @xmath132 without affecting the purity of these states . </S>",
    "<S> we thus deal with a quantum non - demolition measurement ( with non - unit efficiency ) of joint parity .    we have shown how to achieve continuous quantum non - demolition measurement of three parity - type observables for harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the case of multi - photon driven dissipative systems previously introduced for universal quantum computation with cat - qubits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the three observables consist of @xmath133 for a single - mode under two - photon process , joint - parity @xmath129 for two modes under two - photon process , and @xmath87 under four - photon process . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous and qnd measurement of these observables play a central role towards scalable fault - tolerant architectures for universal quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a possible implementation of these measurements through the high - impedance coupling of the cavity mode(s ) to a josephson junction . while the focus of this letter is on zeno dynamics induced by multi - photon driven dissipation , the scheme could also be adapted to non - dissipative cases such as  @xcite . indeed , in presence of strong kerr type non - linearities , the hamiltonian perturbation due to high - impedance coupling to a josephson circuit results in the creation of a parity hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , considering a cavity subjected to strong self - kerr effect and a two - photon drive , the hamiltonian , in the interaction picture , is given by @xmath134 , with @xmath135 the self - kerr coefficient , and @xmath136 the two - photon drive strength  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d - manifold @xmath137 is a doubly degenerate eigenspace of @xmath138 , separated from the other eigenspaces by an energy gap of order @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the first order effect of a perturbative hamiltonian @xmath140 ( see expression ( [ eq : rwahamiltonian ] ) ) with @xmath141 , we lift the degeneracy of @xmath20 , leading to two non - degenerate eigenstates approximately given by @xmath142 and @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that we have achieved an effective @xmath144 hamiltonian on the logical basis of cat states .    </S>",
