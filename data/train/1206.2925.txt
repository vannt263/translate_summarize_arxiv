    "andromeda s bulge dominates the stellar luminosity and mass within the central 1.5 kpc ( @xmath5kpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "the bulge contributes @xmath630% of the total stellar mass and luminosity in m31 , and it is clearly the highest surface brightness feature at uv ",

    "while the integrated colours and luminosity of m31 may place the galaxy in the `` green valley '' @xcite , the optical colours of the bulge are red , with a @xmath7 to 1.0 @xcite , placing it securely in the range of the red - sequence , where most early - type galaxies are found .",
    "@xcite even used the spectral energy distribution of the centre of m31 as a representative for the average giant elliptical galaxy when determining @xmath8-corrections .",
    "this `` early - type '' nature of the bulge is supported by the old mean stellar age determined for the central region of m31 .",
    "resolved star colour - magnitude diagrams created by ground - based , adaptive - optics , nir imaging reveal a population dominated by stars greater than 6 gyr @xcite , while single - stellar population fits to absorption - line indices from slit - spectroscopy of the bulge @xcite find that the bulge of m31 is uniformly old ( @xmath9 gyr , excluding the central arcsecs ) .",

    "compounding this is a low co - h@xmath11 ratio @xcite , and a low total hi column @xcite giving a total cool gas mass in the centre of only a few @xmath12 ( @xmath13% of the bulge stellar mass ) , likely dominated by molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "hence dust , when detected , tends to be in a warmer state in spheroids than that found across the disks of later - type galaxies .",
    "given the high density of stars in bulges , stellar heating is the likeliest explanation for the observed warmer dust temperatures in etgs . yet the old stellar ages found in etgs , and especially in the centre of m31 , argue against the standard view that the ir luminosity and warm dust is a direct tracer of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the magphys model fit returns a stellar mass within this 1kpc radius of @xmath40 , and an unattenuated stellar luminosity of @xmath41 .",
    "the dust luminosity of the m31 centre is @xmath42 , with magphys determining a total dust mass of only @xmath43 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the @xmath44 stellar mass of the bulge makes it a significant fraction ( @xmath45% ) of the total stellar mass of m31 @xcite .",
    "the optical  uv colours clearly reveal the old stellar age of the bulge , with nuv-@xmath46 .",
    "these colours lead to an extremely low estimated specific star formation rate from the model , with ssfr@xmath47 ( sfr @xmath48 ) , in agreement with the lack of young stars observed in the bulge of m31 . @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the values here for the dust mass and luminosity in the central kiloparsecs are likely upper limits for the dust in the bulge , as even at these small radii , some fraction of the ir emission still arises from the disk in the foreground and background due to the high inclination of andromeda .",
    "this contribution of the disk infrared emission may also explain the weak uv ( @xmath49 ) excess observed in the unattenuated spectrum of the best fit magphys model relative to the observed sed .",
    "to explain the observed ir sed , the magphys model finds a small component of buried young stars necessary .",
    "this component is small ( as demonstrated by the low ssfr ) , and can not be associated with the bulge ( as the high - resolution observations have shown ) , but still contributes significantly to the unattenuated uv .",
    "the total attenuation in the diffuse ism is extremely low , as can be seen in the differences between the black and blue curves , with the model finding an attenuation in the diffuse ism of only @xmath50 .",
    "the low value of attenuation measured from the sed matches that observed in @xmath51-band attenuation maps @xcite , and is a result of a very low dust column , with the sed fit returning an average dust column density of only @xmath52kpc@xmath53 in the central region .",
    "in contrast to the stellar mass , the bulge contributes little to the total dust mass in m31 . at larger radii , emission from the disk of m31 along the minor axis overlaps with ( and dominates over ) the dust emission from the bulge .",
    "fits to the integrated ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the andromeda galaxy ( within a 21.5 kpc aperture , krause et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , using both the @xcite and @xcite models , reveal that the dust mass in the inner 2kpc only contributes @xmath60.5% to the total dust mass of m31 .",
    "however , the central 1 kpc contributes a ten - times larger fraction ( i.e.  @xmath54% ) to the total ir luminosity of m31 , because of the relatively warmer dust emission .",
    "we can quantify the temperature of this dust in the bulge and in the rest of m31 by fitting simple modified blackbodies .",
    "we now convert the spatially resolved thermal - ir seds into dust temperatures , describing the emission locally with a single dust temperature , @xmath55 . while a simplification , this method returns a reasonable estimate for the mean , luminosity - weighted temperature of the dust .",
    "we do this by using a simple modified blackbody ; @xmath56 where the dust surface brightness , @xmath57 , is proportional to the planck function for the given dust temperature , @xmath58 , modified by the dust emissivity , which is assumed to be a power - law function of frequency , @xmath59 . at a given dust temperature",
    "this is then simply multiplied by the dust column density , @xmath60 , to yield the surface brightness .",
    "the power - law function is a reasonable approximation for the dust emissivity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the galactic diffuse ism well fit by an emissivity index of @xmath61 @xcite . while a mean temperature for the dust can be determined , in reality there will be a range of temperatures along the lines - of - sight due to both a distribution of grain sizes and heating radiation fields ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this simplified modelling foremost reflects a physically - motivated conversion of the fir colours into the three parameters returned by the fitting procedure : @xmath55 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed description of the issues and uncertainties in using simple modified blackbodies for integrated ir data .",
    "we fit the modified blackbody to the 100 - 500@xmath17  herschel bands at the 500@xmath17  resolution .",
    "we do not include the pacs 70@xmath17  data due to the lower s / n across the m31 image , and as we expect the emission at these wavelengths to have a significant contribution from stochastically heated dust grains .",
    "we limit our fitting to all pixels with @xmath64 in all 5 bands , which in practice is limited predominantly by the pacs 100@xmath17  band . to fit the simple modified blackbody to the data , we assume a uniform , bounded prior grid for all three parameters , compute the @xmath65 goodness of fit for every model parameter set @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the observed surface brightness and observational uncertainty for the band @xmath70 , respectively , and @xmath71 is the model flux for parameter set , @xmath66 , determined from equation [ eqn : mbb ] . the bounds for dust temperature and emissivity were @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "we then determine the probability for each parameter set assuming a gaussian distribution , @xmath74 , and marginalise over the other parameters to determine the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for each parameter , e.g.  t@xmath75 .",
    "an examination of the pdf for t@xmath75 in several pixels shows a symmetric gaussian distribution ( as can be seen in the symmetric uncertainties in figure [ fig : m31twrad ] ) , providing justification for our assumed gaussian uncertainties for the parameters .",
    "we performed this fit for every @xmath76 pixel in the m31 ir data that laid above our @xmath77 cut , with the resulting image for the dust temperature shown in figure [ fig : m31temp ] .",
    "pixels which fall below our @xmath77 cut are shown as white , with the dust temperature ( k ) shown by the colour , as indicated by the colour - bar at the bottom of the image .",
    "note that within 2 kpc , almost all pixels have sufficient s / n . the median temperature across the image is 17k , close to mips based disk temperature of @xmath78k determined by @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties ( half the 16 - 84 percentiles , or @xmath79 if the uncertainties are gaussian ) range from 5 to 15% , with the largest uncertainties in regions at the lowest signal to noise and the central kiloparsec .",
    "the median uncertainty is @xmath66% ( @xmath80k ) dominated by the emission in the dusty , star - forming ring seen in galex and fir images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )        two things stand out in this temperature map : the almost constant temperature in the disk of m31 , with t@xmath81k , and the strong temperature increase in the central @xmath62 kpc .",
    "the temperature in the 10kpc ring of m31 is clearly not exactly constant , with warm spots occurring throughout the ring .",
    "these warm spots correspond with the locations of hii regions in the disk as determined by h@xmath82 images ( c.f .",
    "the @xmath31  maps of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the central dust temperature rise is more clearly quantified by taking the median sed in radial bins .",
    "to do so we determined the median flux in all bands in radial bins of 230 pc ( using elliptical annuli with a p.a.@xmath83 and axis ratio of 0.26 ) , and determined the pdfs for all three parameters for each radial bin .",
    "the resulting temperature variation with radius is shown in figure [ fig : m31twrad ] , with the 1684 percentiles marked by the error bars .",
    "this plot clearly shows the marked increase in dust temperature in the inner 2kpc from the median disk dust temperature of t@xmath84k .",
    "the peak in dust temperature at the centre of @xmath85k is similar to the dust temperature of t@xmath86k determined by @xcite for the central 4@xmath30 , using iras data and assuming a power law emissivity of @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found 34k ( using @xmath87 ) for approximately the same central region and same data .",
    "as these works use apertures of 4@xmath30  diameter , to define the centre , these temperatures represent an average of the inner @xmath88 kpc and thus are remarkably close to our determined value .",
    "as these fits are based on only the iras 60 and 100@xmath17  bands , and thus biased to the warmer dust temperatures due to the shorter wavelengths , the similarity in temperatures suggest that a single , warm component of dust dominates the ir sed in the centre .",
    "this is supported by the similarity of the pacs 70@xmath17  flux and the model flux in the central kpc , even though not actually used to determine the fit .",
    "in addition to giving access to the full ir sed , and thus a better measure of dust temperature , the higher resolution of _ herschel _ enables us to see the steep gradient in temperature from the disk to the centre .",
    "this difference between the bulge and disk dust temperature in m31 agrees with what @xcite found for the kingfish sample of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the ratio of the central to disk dust temperature was greater than 1 across their sample , and increased with increasingly earlier types ( see e.g.  their figure 3 ) .",

    "the black circle outlines the central kiloparsec region . ]",
    "the emissivity , @xmath62 , determined from these fits has a large uncertainty across m31 , and is consistent with @xmath61 at all radii .",
    "given this , we created a higher resolution temperature map using only the 100 , 160 , and 250 @xmath17  bands with the assumption of a constant emissivity of @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting image of the central region is shown in figure [ fig : m31t250 ] , where the central kiloparsec region is marked as a black circle and the median uncertainty is 0.75 k. interestingly , while more structure in the temperature distribution in the centre is seen due to the higher resolution , the overall temperature gradient in the centre still dominates the image .",
    "the steeper gradient in dust temperature along the minor axis arises from the mixture of disk dust emission with that from the bulge , leading to an overall lower average dust temperature in these regions .",
    "the fine scale structure is likely due to the distribution of the diffuse gas and dust as seen in figure [ fig : m31ha_ir ] .      the clear temperature increase in the central regions of m31 as seen in figure [ fig : m31twrad ] is interesting as it closely corresponds with the stellar light distribution as traced by the near - ir emission , suggesting that the heating of the dust and bulge are linked .",
    "as @xcite demonstrated ( particularly their figure 3c ) , both the @xmath31  and diffuse x - ray emission also increase toward the centre in the same manner as the stellar light . however , with the resolution offered by _",
    "herschel _ we can begin to understand the heating of the dust in the bulge of m31 , and by proxy in the bulges of early type spirals and in early - type galaxies .      in principle",
    ", one possibility for heating the dust is a low level of star formation , buried amongst the dust and bulge stars .",
    "however , high resolution observations by hst show that no ob stars are apparent throughout the bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and no regions of high enough attenuation to bury such potential star formation are observed @xcite .",
    "also , the observed emission line ratios in the ionized gas ( e.g.  [ nii]/@xmath31 ) argue against young stars being the dominant heating mechanism @xcite .    as the super massive black hole at the centre of m31 ( dubbed m31@xmath90 ) is quiescent @xcite , heating by an agn radiation field can be discounted .",
    "in addition , the radial profile of dust temperature is incompatible with a dominant central source heating , as shown in the following section .",
    "collisional heating of the dust by the hot @xmath91 k x - ray gas at the centre of m31 @xcite is another possibility ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the association of the dust with the @xmath31  emission and the weak detection of co in regions of higher attenuation ( discussed in section [ sec : dang ] ) indicate that the dust is in a denser medium , and not predominantly associated with the x - ray gas itself . likewise , the total energy in the diffuse x - ray gas is insufficient to fully explain the @xmath31emission , and thus is unlikely to heat the dust either @xcite .",
    "thus , while this may contribute to the emission , it is insufficient to explain the majority of the hot dust emission .",
    "this leaves the high stellar density of old stars at the centre as the dominant heating mechanism of the dust in the bulge of m31 , as originally suggested by@xcite . by comparing the stellar light distribution for the bulge against the distribution of temperatures in the central kiloparsecs",
    ", we can now demonstrate the link between the heating of dust by the bulge and the dust emission . in the case of a simple steady - state temperature , grain cooling balances the dust heating , and",

    "the first assumption is based on the findings given in section [ sec : dang ] , where the correlation of ionized gas and dust suggest a thin disk geometry .",
    "the measured opacity in the bulge of m31 is low , as shown by @xcite , as is the average dust column of @xmath52kpc@xmath53 ( see  [ sec : sed ] ) , thus the assumption of optically thin dust is not unreasonable . as for the third assumption ,",

    "inclination angle to the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a simple spherical approximation for the bulge with a constant mass - to - light ratio can actually reasonably well reproduce the stellar light profile , as shown by @xcite .",

    "while some of this may arise from a gradient in attenuation , there exists also radial gradients in the uv - emitting stellar populations @xcite that may affect our assumptions ( though the follow section argues against this ) .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : isrfb ] , given these assumptions , using the model for the bulge profile from @xcite and the integrated unattenuated stellar luminosity from section [ sec : sed ] , the bulge interstellar radiation field heating the dust is @xmath106 at a radius @xmath34 ( in kiloparsecs ) , and a bulge scale radius of @xmath107kpc .",
    "from equations [ eqn : tdu2 ] and [ eqn : ub ] , we can then determine the expected dust temperature ( given the above assumptions ) as a function of spherical radius .",
    "for an infinitely thin disk , located in the plane of m31 , we can equate the dust temperature in spherical coordinates with that in cylindrical ( i.e.  @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) , giving @xmath110^{\\frac{1}{6 } } \\,{\\rm k},\\ ] ] where the factor 1750 arises from using the milky way dust model described above for @xmath99 , and @xmath3 is in erg@xmath111 as in equation [ eqn : ub ] .    in figure",

    "overlaid on this distribution are two curves . the expected dust heating distribution , @xmath113 , as given by equation [ eqn : tdur ] ,",
    "is shown by the dotted curve .",

    "this brings it in agreement with the observed temperature distribution except at radii larger than @xmath115kpc .",
    "the first thing to take from these two curves is that the bulge provides a more than sufficient interstellar radiation field ( isrf@xmath116 ) to heat the dust , with expected temperatures in excess of that observed .",

    "this leaves the question , why is the expected temperature distribution in excess of that observed ?    ) of m31 .",

    "overlaid on this are two curves showing expected heating as based on the determined bulge isrf .",
    "the dotted and solid curves show , respectively , the expected dust temperature distribution , @xmath113 , from equation [ eqn : tdur ] and the same @xmath113 scaled by 0.8 . ]",
    "there are several possibilities given our simple assumptions .",
    "one possible explanation is suggested by the flattening of the @xmath118 pixel distribution in figure [ fig : tdist ] at radii @xmath119kpc .",
    "this flattening is most likely due to the increasing disk contribution to the ir at these radii , which acts to lower the mean line - of - sight dust temperature .",
    "this is approximately the radius where the stellar mass distribution , and therefore light distribution , becomes disk dominated ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus disk dust is likely also dominating the determined dust temperature . as discussed in section [ sec : m31temp ] and shown in figure [ fig : m31temp ] , the mean dust temperature across the disk is @xmath120k , which is also where the pixel distribution flattens to in figure [ fig : tdist ] .",
    "figure [ fig : m31t250 ] also gives some indication of the disk contribution to the bulge temperature , as there is clearly a flatter gradient of temperatures along the major axis as compared to the minor axis , which should have a greater contribution of disk dust due to the high inclination of m31 .",
    "however , an examination of the observed ir sed within the central kiloparsec indicates that it is well described by a single black - body , as mentioned in section [ sec : radtemp ] . as a confirmation",
    "we also fitted the pixel - seds in the central region with a combination of two modified - blackbodies .",
    "for both blackbodies , we assumed an emissivity of @xmath61 , and let the temperature of the first component free , and that of the second , cooler component constrained to 17k .",
    "a simple fit found that the central kpc region is dominated by the warmer component , whose temperature distribution is almost indistinguishable from figure [ fig : tdist ] .",
    "thus , while it must occur at radii @xmath121kpc , the contribution of the disk can not explain the offset between the theoretical curve and the observational - based temperature .",
    "another possibility is that the dust in the bulge is not milky way like , and our assumed @xmath99 is incorrect .",
    "for example , if we assume a milky way model of dust , but with @xmath122 ( using the @xcite model opacity ) , @xmath123 reduces to @xmath124 ( normalised at @xmath100@xmath17 , as above ) .",
    "such a possibility is reasonable , given that the extreme environs of the bulge may act to alter the dust size distribution , destroying small grains leading to a flatter opacity .",
    "however , given the index of @xmath125 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tdu2 ] , the offset in temperature requires a significant change in dust opacity if this alone causes this offset .",
    "similarly , our estimate of @xmath3 is also likely incorrect given that the bulge is not spherical @xcite , and the dust is not in a perfectly thin disk .",
    "however , the index of @xmath125 again requires our @xmath3 to be over estimated by approximately an order of magnitude if it alone is incorrect .",
    "more likely , it is a combination of these , plus the possibility of some self - shielding by dust ( which acts to reduce the @xmath3 seen by the dust ) , which lead to the difference between the theoretical temperature distribution and that determined from the modified blackbody fit to the data . yet",
    "it should still be noted , that these are all needed to reduce the theoretical heating to that observed . the bulge stellar radiation field provides more than sufficient energy to heat the warm dust at the centre of m31 .    as a final check that the bulge stars are dominating the heating",
    ", we can apply the same methodology and reasoning as used for eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tdu2 ] , but assuming that the radiation field heating the dust arises from a central point source ( i.e.  agn or nuclear star cluster ) , meaning that @xmath126 . however , when @xmath114 is determined for this radiation field ( similar to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tdur ] ) , the slope does not show the same form as in figure [ fig : tdist ] , demonstrating that the heating radiation field must be extended .",
    "even allowing for a greater contribution of the disk emission to approximate the observed slope , to match the point source @xmath114 to the measured @xmath127 requires a central luminosity that would be obvious in the optical ( or x - ray ) emission , which is discounted by observations as already discussed @xcite .",
    "while figure [ fig : tdist ] clearly links the bulge with the dust emission , it does not reveal what exactly is heating the dust .",
    "typically , due to the steep wavelength dependence of the dust opacity , the dust ir emission has been associated with uv light and hence star formation .",
    "typically , diffuse dust is considered to be heated by a local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) or scaling thereof ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as this isrf is typically based on the local isrf of @xcite , the uv light dominates the heating of dust ( e.g. figure 4 in * ?",
    "* ) , and as the local uv light is dominated by b stars , the diffuse dust emission indirectly traces b stars and thus star formation on longer ( @xmath128 myr ) timescales .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the uv light strongly peaks at the centre of m31 .",
    "however this uv light in the bulge has been shown to be not associated with star - formation , but rather arises from extreme horizontal branch stars @xcite .    ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the total absorption cross - section per gram of dust for the mw dust model with @xmath102 from @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the product of these , revealing the wavelength distribution of the energy absorbed by dust .",
    "the conclusion is that the optical stellar light is the main contributor to the dust heating in the bulge . ]    however , while these hot , low - mass stars may be the source of the uv upturn and possibly the @xmath31  emission , they can not be the dominant heating source of the dust .",
    "based on the iras and ans observations , @xcite realised that the uv light would not be sufficient to heat the dust , and the heating would be dominated by the @xmath129 nm light from evolved stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : bulge_dustabs ] , we show three panels that illustrate which radiation heats the dust . in the top panel we take the `` unattenuated sed '' from figure [ fig : m31sed ] , which is likely an overestimate at @xmath130 m ( see section [ sec : fir ] ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the total dust absorption cross - section per gram of dust for the mw dust model with @xmath102 from @xcite , as also used in the previous section . by multiplying these together",
    "we obtain the amount of energy absorbed per h atom as a function of wavelength ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this figure reveals that most of the energy that heats the dust arises from optical photons , not the uv .",
    "as the @xmath131 slope is @xmath132 , the uv - optical slope needs to be @xmath133 ( in frequency ) for optical photons to dominate the heating of dust .",
    "as mentioned before , the bottom panel of figure [ fig : bulge_dustabs ] most likely overemphasises the role of uv photons in the heating due to the small uv excess in the model stellar sed ( blue curve in figure [ fig : m31sed ] ) . the intrinsic uv emission produced by the evolved stars in the centre of m31 ( the so - called uv - upturn observed in early - type galaxies ) is well - reproduced by the @xcite code , as shown by a comparison of models with the observed uv colours of early - type galaxies ( see specifically figure 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even if the model uv is incorrect , the intrinsic uv flux would still need to increase by @xmath134 dex ( or 0.7 dex from the observed value ) to be commensurate with the energy deposited in the optical .",
    "this lack of uv heating is also clear when the top panel of figure [ fig : bulge_dustabs ] is compared with the isrf of @xcite ( e.g.  their figure 1 ) .",
    "when normalised to the peak at @xmath80@xmath17  ( in both radiation fields ) , the uv in the irsf is approximately an order of magnitude greater than that determined in m31 .",
    "furthermore , the hot environment of the circumnuclear region of m31 may destroy the smallest dust grains as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the destruction of small grains flattens the slope of @xmath135 , leading to yet a greater dominance of optical photons in the dust heating .",
    "thus the bulge of m31 is a clear case where the heating of dust is dominated by the light from old stars .",
    "this is in stark contrast to typical star - forming galaxies , where the uv from young stars dominates the heating of dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite had already found with galex ",
    "spitzer data that the dust in the andromeda galaxy as a whole appears to be heated mainly by stars a few gyrs old . @xcite",
    "already inferred that the bulge of m31 takes this further with heating likely dominated by evolved stars",
    ". however , the mean stellar age of the bulge of m31 is @xmath136gyr , with some estimates placing the dominant age @xmath137 gyr @xcite , demonstrating that even the oldest stars are able to heat dust .",
    "this is a clear cautionary note against using warm ir emission as a direct tracer of star formation , or obscured uv emission .",
    "as the nearest massive galaxy , the andromeda galaxy allows us to connect the small scale physics with the integrated properties of galaxies .",
    "the central kiloparsec of m31 actually matches very well many of the observed properties of nearby early - type galaxies . within a 1 kiloparsec ( 4.4@xmath30 )",
    "circular aperture the estimated stellar mass is @xmath138 , with a very old , red stellar light , estimated to be greater than 10gyrs old @xcite .",
    "the optical colours of the bulge , e.g.  nuv-@xmath46 , place it well in the realm of gas poor early - type galaxies ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a low level of dust attenuation across the centre , visible in both the difference between the observed and modelled intrinsic seds in figure [ fig : m31sed ] and in the @xmath139 map ( their figure 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "this low level of attenuation is a result of the low dust column across the centre and connected to the relatively weak ir emission .",
    "the total dust mass within this aperture from the @xcite magphys model is @xmath140 , contributing only 0.5% of the total dust mass to m31 .",
    "however , the bulge contributes @xmath54% of the total ir luminosity due to the relatively warm , blue fir emission .",
    "this dust mass results in a very low @xmath141 for the bulge , with @xmath142 .",
    "this actually places the bulge of m31 in a similar regime as the sample of early - type galaxies explored in the _ herschel _ reference survey ( hrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in @xcite , falling somewhat in between the s0 and e galaxies ( see their figure 8) .",
    "similarly , the temperature increase from disk to bulge in m31 follows the trend of having warmer dust in earlier hubble - types , as observed by @xcite in the kingfish sample .",
    "this trend was also seen by @xcite in the hrs , who found warmer dust in e galaxies than s0 , and an overall warm dust temperature for the sample ( mean @xmath143k ) .",
    "the @xmath144 ratio is also very low in the bulge of m31 , with little hi  and co detected in the centre .",
    "however , ionized gas is seen in @xmath31 and the fir emission is spatially well - correlated with this gas showing a similar lower inclination , barred - spiral pattern as visible in figure [ fig : m31ha_ir ] , with the mir emission also following the diffuse @xmath31  morphology @xcite .",
    "given this correlation , the @xmath31  emission allows the structure of the dust distribution to be determined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indicates that the ism in the centre , including the dust , is in a thin , spiral disk .",
    "the origin of this gas and dust in the centre of m31 is still not known , and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "@xcite suggest that the stellar ejecta are more than sufficient to replenish the observed hot gas in m31 s centre , and suggest the rest of this matter comes out as a hot , x - ray flow .",
    "however , the spiral pattern observed in the bulge does appear to link up with the emission in the disk ( figure [ fig : m31image ] ) , even if it appears to be at a different inclination to the disk .",
    "given the above similarities using the bulge of m31 as a resolved representative of the spheroids of other early - type galaxies is a reasonable assumption .",
    "based on this and our resolved study of dust heating in the bulge we can extrapolate to infer that a similar heating mechanism for the dust occurs in the majority of early - type galaxies in which dust is detected ( i.e. , the @xcite sample ) . while many early - type galaxies do have some agn activity in the centre , and several , generally with higher gas masses , have observed active star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the combination of diffuse , optically thin dust and a strong , diffuse radiation field due to the high stellar density is able to heat dust at the centres of these early - type galaxies to a significantly warmer level than that observed in most stellar disks .",
    "this increased dust temperature makes the generally dust poor early - types still visible in the recent and ongoing fir surveys with _",
    "herschel_.    however , the possible contribution of disk dust to the observed ir emission , as derived from the dust temperature offset in figure [ fig : tdist ] , suggests a final cautionary note in this extrapolation .",
    "the bulge of m31 lies in a far different environment to typical early - type galaxies , which affects both the observed emission , and the evolution of the ism in this early - type spheroid .",
    "when observed in the far - infrared , the bulge of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 , ngc224 ) stands out as a region of luminous blue emission ( i.e. 70@xmath17  bright ) , surrounded by ring - like red emission from the disk .",
    "this corresponds to a peak in the mean dust temperature , t@xmath75 ( figure [ fig : m31temp ] ) . across the disk of m31 ,",
    "the mean dust temperature is reasonably constant with t@xmath145k .",
    "however , within the central kiloparsec , the temperature of the dust rapidly increases , reaching t@xmath146k at the centre , as seen in figure [ fig : m31twrad ] .",
    "the start of this upturn is also where the bulge begins to dominate the stellar radiation field , clearly indicating that the heating mechanism of this warm dust and the bulge are associated .",
    "heating by either an agn or gas - grain collisions is discounted by x - ray observations , leaving stellar heating as the likely source . the radial profile of this steep increase in temperature in the inner kiloparsecs corresponds well with the temperature slope expected from heating by the diffuse radiation field arising from the bulge stars , suggesting direct link .",
    "the theoretical dust temperature based on the diffuse radiation field and our assumptions is actually in excess of that observed , providing more than sufficient heating .",
    "this excess suggests the not unreasonable possibilities of different dust properties in the bulge from the standard diffuse dust in the milky way and that the dust is likely to be in a clumpy distribution with some self - shielding occurring .",
    "however , even though the bulge of m31 is observed in the uv , no young stars are seen in hst observations or spectra @xcite , leaving old ( @xmath136 gyr ) stars as the dominant heating mechanism .",
    "furthermore , by taking the observed sed of the bulge and standard dust opacity it is clear that it is the red optical light of these old stars that dominates the heating of the warm dust in the centre , as originally suggested by @xcite with the iras observations .",
    "together this demonstrates the possibility of heating dust by stars @xmath147 billion years old .",
    "this is one of the clearest demonstrations of how ir emission does not always correlate with star formation , a common assumption , but rather is dependent upon the distribution of dust ( and associated gas ) and the total radiation field , which includes both young and old stars .",
    "the bulge of m31 also demonstrates one of the plausible mechanisms for heating the relatively warm dust observed in the centres of early - type spirals , and early - type galaxies .",
