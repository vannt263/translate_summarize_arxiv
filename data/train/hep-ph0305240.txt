    "the primary physics goal of the  experiment is the study of cp violation in the @xmath3 system .",
    "@xmath3 events are produced by the decay of @xmath4 resonances which are produced in @xmath5 collisions .",
    "some of the @xmath6s decay into cp eigenstates such as @xmath7 , and the subsequent decays of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are detected and reconstructed .",
    "a typical event will produce between 30 and 60 tracks , and typical energies of the final state decay products are :    * lepton pairs : 0.3 @xmath10 2.3 gev / c * @xmath11 : 0.3 @xmath12 2.5 gev * @xmath13 : 0.1 @xmath12 4.5 gev .",
    "hadronic final states are also important because charged @xmath14s and @xmath15s interact in the beam pipe and calorimeters .",
    "typical hadron momenta are    * p @xmath16 4 gev / c , with most @xmath16 1 gev / c .",
    "background events such as bhabha scattering produce the highest energy tracks , with @xmath17 gev / c .",
    "the  detector was built to collect final state tracks with high efficiency and precision , and to allow the reconstruction of @xmath6 decays into a wide range of exclusive final states with low background .",
    "the detector was also designed to operate at the high luminosities provided by the pep - ii accelerator .",
    "the detector consists of a silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) which surrounds the @xmath5 interaction point and provides vertex determination at the 10 @xmath18 m level . surrounding",
    "the svt is a he - isobutane drift chamber ( dch ) for the measurement of charged tracks . outside",
    "the dch is a detector of internally - reflected cherenkov radiation ( drc ) , constructed of quartz bars and used for particle identification ( pid ) . outside",
    "the drc is a csi electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) designed to contain showers from charged and neutral tracks .",
    "a muon tracker and instrumented flux return ( ifr ) , built of alternating layers of iron and resistive plate chamber ( rpc ) detectors , surrounds all the interior detectors .",
    "the simulation was designed to satisfy four main requirements .",
    "it must :    * run within the  framework @xcite .",
    "all the tracking , physics and hit - scoring performed by geant4 @xcite is implemented as a framework module . because the framework is responsible for run and event control",
    ", geant4 must therefore relinquish this duty .",
    "* work with existing event generators , detector response codes and reconstruction codes . at",
    "the time geant4 became available ,  detector response and reconstruction codes were essentially complete and many event generation codes were already available .",
    "* use the objectivity database @xcite for persistence . *",
    "be detailed , yet fast enough to keep up with high - luminosity event production .    a simple diagram of the main functions and operation of the resulting simulation is shown in fig .  [ overview ] .",
    "the geant4 toolkit is used extensively in the simulation .",
    "the detector geometry is built with geant4 simple volumes and boolean operations . as mentioned above",
    ", geant4 is also responsible for hit - scoring and provides all the physics processes .",
    "these include the decay , standard electromagnetic and low - energy hadronic ( @xmath19 ) processes .",
    "some features provided by geant4 , such as detector response code and persistence , are not used .",
    "the default geant4 transportation / navigation process is also not used .",
    "it employs a general runge - kutta stepper which was found to be too slow and not precise enough for the many thin volumes in the  simulation . taking advantage of the slowly varying magnetic field in the  detector",
    ", a specialized stepper was developed to meet these needs .",
    "this stepper determines how far a particle can travel before the field deviates from a locally constant value .",
    "perfect helices are then used to propagate the particle over that distance . if that distance is large , many small steps are avoided .",
    "before being put into production , the geant4 simulation was subjected to a series of validation tests focusing on    * verifying the detector material model , * electromagnetic processes , * hadronic processes , * tracking , resolution and reconstruction , * particle i d , * performance and robustness .    since october 2000",
    ", 20 million simulated events of several types have been produced for these tests .",
    "they include generic @xmath3 , bhabha scattering and dimuon events , among others .",
    "comparsion of these events with data has allowed a refinement of the detector material model to the point that no further changes are necessary .",
    "understanding of particle identification and electromagnetic processes is also believed to be well in hand , although validation in these areas continues .",
    "however , additional validation is required for the hadronic processes .",
    "the  simulation uses the following geant4 electromagnetic processes    * for photons : photo - electric effect , compton scattering and @xmath5 pair production ; * for electrons and positrons : electron ionization , electron bremsstrahlung and @xmath20 annihilation ; * for muons : @xmath18 ionization , @xmath18 bremsstrahlung and @xmath5 pair production by muons ; * for hadrons : hadron ionization ; * for all charged particles : multiple scattering .",
    "one of the most basic validation tests is to reproduce the expected energy loss due to ionization processes . in this case ,",
    "minimum ionizing electrons and positrons from radiative bhabha scattering were examined in the he - isobutane gas of the drift chamber .",
    "simulated events are compared to data from a recent run in fig .",
    "[ dedx ] , where it is seen that both the shape and normalization of the @xmath21 distributions are in agreement to within 15% .",
    "this indicates that fluctuations in the energy loss are reasonably well - reproduced .",
    "more importantly , the mean values of @xmath21 agree to within 1% .",
    "it is also important to study electromagnetic showers in the csi calorimeter .",
    "measuring shower shapes provides a cumulative test of the photon and electron processes listed above .",
    "radiative bhabha scattering was used to examine the distribution of azimuthal and lateral shower parameters as a function of electron / positron energy .",
    "[ shower ] shows the lateral distribution parameter ( lat ) . with the exception of a few energy bins , distributions of both of these parameters",
    "were found to show good agreement between data and simulation for all electron and positron energies up to 4 gev .",
    "the comparison of reconstructed events from data and simulation provides a stringent validation test . in an accurate reconstruction of the @xmath11 mass and width provides a test of many detector performance features , including tracking , energy scale , shower development , shower containment and detector response .    in @xmath3 events ,",
    "the decay @xmath22 provides @xmath11s with energies between 0.3 and 2.1 gev .",
    "[ pi0 ] shows the reconstructed mass for @xmath11s with total energies between 0.8 and 1.0 gev . for both data and simulated samples",
    "the mass is close to the expected value , which indicates that tracking , energy scale and shower containment are well - understood .",
    "the widths , however , are significantly different and point to problems in shower development or detector response . since it is believed that the shower development is understood , detector response should be examined in future validation tests .",
    "the electromagnetic processes of hadron ionization and multiple scattering are of primary importance in the propagation of long - lived hadrons through the detector .",
    "hadronic interactions are still important , however , because scattering from nuclei and the production of hadronic secondaries in the dense material of the emc and ifr can affect the energy deposition .    hadronic interactions in the  simulation are currently handled by the so - called `` low energy parameterized '' , or lep , model .",
    "this is a re - engineered version of the gheisha code @xcite , which has been tuned for hadrons with incident energies below 20 gev .",
    "even so , it is not particularly appropriate at  hadron energies which are typically below 1 gev .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ pilep ] which shows the pion production cross section for 730 mev protons on a thin carbon target .",
    "large , qualitative differences between the lep model and data are evident .",
    "recently , however , better models , such as the bertini cascade @xcite , have become available . as shown in fig .",
    "[ piber ] , much better agreement with the data is achieved at all angles .",
    "a current limitation of this model is that it is not valid for kaons .",
    "the hadronic process validation in  has so far concentrated on the comparison of results from various models to published data from other experiments in which the incident hadron energies are in the  range .",
    "validations using  data are just beginning .",
    "while  is certainly not optimized for hadronic physics validation , two regions of the detector are useful for tests .",
    "the beam pipe support tube is a cylinder of carbon fiber and the inner wall of the drift chamber is a cylinder of beryllium .",
    "tests are just beginning which use these regions as thin targets for incident hadrons .",
    "the simulation stage of  event production includes event generation , tracking and hit - scoring .",
    "a pentium iii 866 mhz pc currently requires 5.0 seconds on average to simulate a @xmath3 event .",
    "average execution times for other  event types are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".execution time for  events [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    up to now , relatively little effort has been devoted to optimizing performance because validation was the main concern . however , some increase in speed is expected with    * improvements in  geometry models , * improvements in the geant4 electromagnetic processes , and * fine tuning of the secondary particle production cuts",
    ".    on the other hand , the improved hadronic models are much more cpu - intensive than the currently used lep model , and will cause some slowdown .",
    "after the production of 20 million validation events , many of the bugs in both the  simulation code and in geant4 have been shaken out . to date ,  simulation production has generated more than 1.5 billion events of all types at roughly 20 production sites in north america and europe , with a failure rate of less than one event per million in the simulation stage .",
    "is the first large experiment to develop and use a geant4-based simulation .",
    "a detailed detector model has been developed using the geant4 geometry , and both electromagnetic and hadronic interactions are implemented with geant4 physics processes .",
    "the simulation was designed to run within the  framework application .",
    "comparisons of simulated event samples and  data indicate that the electromagnetic processes perform largely as expected in the few gev energy range .",
    "validation tests of the lep hadronic model show that more detailed models will be required before good agreement with data can be achieved .",
    "the  simulation has proven to be robust , with 1.5 billion events generated so far at a low failure rate .",
    "future efforts will concentrate on improving the overall speed of the simulation . +",
