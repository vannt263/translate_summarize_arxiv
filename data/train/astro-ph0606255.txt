    "quasars form a class of objects that frequently warrant superlatives in their descriptions : 1745 + 624 ( 4c+62.29 ) is no exception .",

    "it is probably no coincidence that its 2.5  long jet ( 18 kpc projected ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also the most luminous radio jet currently known ( that we are aware of ; cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accounting for @xmath131/4th of the source s total 1.4 ghz luminosity .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  [ figure-1 ] ) and arcsecond - scales ( figures  [ figure-2 ] & [ figure-3 ] ) .",
    "we were prompted to identify such high - redshift systems with large - scale jets after the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory detection of a @xmath132.5  long x - ray extension @xcite in the @xmath0=4.3 quasar gb  1508 + 5714 @xcite .",
    "subsequent vlba imaging of gb  1508 + 5714 has revealed a parsec - scale jet that can be traced out to @xmath13100 milli - arcseconds ( 0.7",

    "* ) , aimed in the general direction of the kpc - scale structure , supporting the jet interpretation .",
    "these are the two most distant quasars with a _ kiloparsec - scale _ jet=5.47 blazar q0906 + 6930 by @xcite , but on vlbi scales only . ] detected at any wavelength @xcite .",
    "the identification of such systems in the early universe is extremely interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "jets are signposts for `` active '' black hole / accretion disk systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requiring central nuclei of high-@xmath0 galaxies to be sufficiently well - developed to sustain gravitational collapse . at such early epochs , it is remarkable that the jet production process is apparently efficient and persists long enough ( @xmath14myr ) to have produced such large ( 10s100 s kpc - scale ) structures . in this context",
    ", jets may even serve as tracers of the directionality of the bh / disk axis in these early accreting systems , as chronicled in the `` bumps and wiggles '' in our jet images . also , these jets are an efficient means to shock heat ambient gas thus triggering early star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among other important issues ,",
    "such high - redshift systems are potentially very important to our understanding of the emission processes responsible for the production of the broad - band jet emission , and the x - rays in particular .",
    "although the number of quasars with kpc - scale jets detected in the x - rays is growing @xcite , the origin of this radiation is still in active debate .",
    "@xcite noted early on that a comparison of cosmologically distant jets with local examples could in principle provide crucial arguments to the debate .",
    "this is because the two main contending models for the x - ray emission of large - scale quasar jets  synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb )  have , in their simplest versions , markedly different predictions of the x - ray jet properties with redshift ( see   [ section - z ] ) .",
    "a high - resolution _ chandra _ image of the @xmath0=3.89 quasar 1745 + 624 was obtained in an early observing cycle ( table  [ table-1 ] ) and x - ray emission from the arcsecond - scale radio jet is in fact detected and is quite prominent also .",
    "apart from the gb  1508 + 5714 case mentioned above , evidence has been presented recently for at least one more high-@xmath0 quasar with extended x - ray emission ( j22192719 at @xmath0=3.63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a radio counterpart ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and manuscript in preparation ) .",
    "this makes 1745 + 624 one of only three very high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) systems with extended x - rays associated with a radio jet .    with the scarcity of such high - redshift systems and their importance in current discussions of x - ray jet emission models",
    ", we have independently analyzed the archival _ chandra _ data .",
    "it was also realized that 1745 + 624 hosts an exceptional jet making it conducive to study .",
    "this is because while both the gb  1508 + 5714 and j22192719 cases each show a single faint ( @xmath131 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) arcsecond - scale feature separated from their bright nuclei , the 1745 + 624 jet is 2 orders of magnitude brighter than the other two cases and shows _ resolved structure_. in addition , it is the most luminous x - ray jet observed thus far ( cf .",
    "* ) .    to fully exploit the potential of the _ chandra _ observation , we have also analyzed archival multi - frequency imaging data from the very large array ( vla ) , and a hubble space telescope ( hst ) image to map the spectral energy distributions of the extended components in the quasar jet .",
    "these data , along with a new deep very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) map of the extended subarcsecond - scale jet are described in  ",
    "[ section - vlbi][section - chandra ] , with a critical assessment of the derived spectra of the kpc - scale components in   [ section - spectra ] .",
    "the physical properties of these extended components are then discussed (   [ section - discuss ] ) , with comparisons made to the other two quasars with x - ray detected knots at comparably high - redshift ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "these distant examples are compared to other currently known x - ray jets in quasars at lower redshift ( @xmath162 ) in light of expectations from synchrotron and inverse compton emission models .",
    "our results are summarized in   [ section - summary ] .",
    "vlbi maps of 1745 + 624 show a prominent parsec - scale jet and the emission fading with distance out to @xmath1340 mas @xcite . the lower frequency , 2.3 ghz usno radio reference frame image database maps ( rrfid , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the jet is even more extended .",
    "we therefore uniformly reprocessed the six best ( @xmath17 ) datasets at this frequency from the rrfid ( obtained between 1997 march to 1998 august ) and produced images on the same grid , reconvolved with a common 4 mas beam .",
    "we then averaged the 6 images to suppress the noise in the background resulting in improved definition of the outer jet ( figure  [ figure-1 ] ) .",
    "the parsec - scale jet in this ",
    "average \" image is now clear out to @xmath13110 mas ( 0.8 kpc projected ) allowing us to trace (   [ section - describe ] ) the vlbi - scale emission to the outer structure sampled by the vla data ( figure  [ figure-2 ] and   [ section - radio ] ) .    at 4 mas resolution",
    ", the initial bright segment of the vlbi jet is oriented at position angle ( pa ) 212  and contains two prominent peaks at roughly 14 mas ( 22.3 mjy / bm ) and 23 mas ( 10.4 mjy / bm ) . at @xmath1350 mas from the core , the jet position angle increases ( by @xmath134 ) and transitions to the outer fainter portion .",
    "curiously , the eastern ridgeline of the outer portion lines up with the central pa of the inner jet .",
    "the integrated flux of the visible jet in the 2.3 ghz map is @xmath13110 mjy with the outer portion contributing about 20 mjy of this .",
    "we measure a jet to counter - jet ratio of @xmath1450 ( defined as the ratio of the peak to 3 times the rms noise on the counter - jet side ) of the first visible peak in the 2.3 ghz map .      in light of the high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio _ chandra _ detection of the arcsecond - scale jet in 1745 + 624 (   [ section - chandra ] ) , we desired comparable information about its structure and spectra in the radio band .",
    "@xcite first discovered the extended radio emission in short vla observations at 1.5 , 5 and 15 ghz . the two main x - ray emitting knots which we dub k1.4 and k1.8 ( indicating their distance from the core in arcseconds ) , and the terminal ( brightest ) jet feature at 2.5  are readily identifiable in their 5 ghz map .",
    "for the sake of discussion , we classify the terminal knot , k2.5 , as the radio `` hot spot '' in the context of similar x - ray detected features in other powerful jets ( see below and   [ section - hotspot ] ) .",
    "@xcite noted also an 8.5 ghz vla detection of this terminal feature by @xcite from a 100 sec .",
    "observation , though no image is presented .",
    "these four datasets form the basis of our radio analysis of the jet . at the two higher frequencies ,",
    "these data are supplemented by the only other available vla datasets ",
    "sparse snapshots from the more compact configurations to help fill in the shorter ( @xmath17 ) spacings ( see table  [ table-1 ] for a summary of the data ) .",
    "the data were obtained from the nrao archive and calibrated in aips @xcite utilizing scans of the calibrators 3c  48 and 3c  286 to set the amplitude scale . in the high - resolution a - configuration 15 ghz experiment ( program ab414 ; table  [ table-1 ] ) , 3c  48 is heavily resolved so could not be relied on for this purpose .",
    "fortunately , the phase calibrator 1803 + 784 was monitored frequently at this frequency by the umrao @xcite and was found to be fairly stable over the two month period bracketing the vla epoch ( within @xmath137@xmath4 of the average of 3 jy over 7 observations ) , so the amplitude scale was set with this data .",
    "the calibrated ( @xmath17 ) data were exported into the caltech difmap package @xcite for self - calibration and imaging .",
    "the multi - frequency images were registered on the image peaks , i.e. , the arcsecond - scale radio core .",
    "this registration must be good to within a small fraction of the vla beams because the majority of the vlbi flux is concentrated within a few 10 s mas (   [ section - vlbi ] ) .",
    "improving on the previous studies , we were able to separate and detect emission from the radio hot spot _ and _ the jet at all four frequencies ( figure  [ figure-2 ] ) .",
    "the 1.5 ghz image is a `` super - resolved '' image , created by reconvolving the data with a beam 1/3rd of the uniformly weighted one .",
    "an excess due to the jet is apparent ( figure  [ figure-2 ] ) .",
    "there is also an apparent excess adjacent to the core , on the side opposite of the visible jet ; a similar excess is seen in the 5 ghz image .",
    "this could be suggestive of real emission on the counterjet side , although it is equally likely that they are spurious due to the gaps in ( @xmath17 ) coverage of the datasets .",
    "we considered the individual knot spectra (   [ section - spectra ] ) but were concerned with the differing ( @xmath17 ) coverages affecting the spectral measurements of the jet . to mitigate against this",
    ", we tapered and convolved the three higher - frequency images with a common 0.35  beam ( see e.g. , figures  [ figure-3 ]  &  [ figure-5 ] ) and integrate the radio jet emission over several beamwidths when we measured the `` total '' jet spectral index between the 3 frequencies (   [ section - spectra ] ) .",
    "additional polarization leakage - term calibration of the 5 ghz dataset was performed using observations of the calibrator , 1748253 , from an adjacent program am337 . the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) of the resultant polarization image",
    "was determined by setting the evpa of 3c  48 to 106@xmath18 . the integrated rotation measure ( rm ) of 28.4@xmath190.5 radians",
    "m@xmath20 @xcite toward 1745 + 624 amounts to a small correction of 6  at 5 ghz , and this correction has been applied to the polarization map in figure  [ figure-3 ] .    at 5 ghz , the initial segment of the radio jet is highly polarized at @xmath1320@xmath4 out to knot k1.4 with stronger interknot polarization of 30@xmath4 .",
    "the rm corrected map shows the evpa perpendicular to the direction of the jet along most of this length , i.e. , the implied magnetic field is parallel to the jet  quite typical in powerful one - sided jets @xcite . also typical",
    "is the low polarization in the core ( @xmath134@xmath4 ) .",
    "the parallel - to - the - jet magnetic field configuration roughly continues into k1.8 and the terminal radio feature , which we classify as a hot spot based on its terminal position and compactness .",
    "the hot spot is unresolved with an average deconvolved major axis of 0.15  and aspect ratio of 0.5 elongated at position angle of 254  ( fits consistent between the 5 , 8.5 , and 15 ghz datasets ) .",
    "this outer portion of the jet exhibits lower radio polarization levels of @xmath1356@xmath4 .",
    "the polarization pattern in k1.8 is not uniform and field cancellation may account for its low polarization .",
    "the dimensions of the jet knots , k1.4 and k1.8 , are not obviously resolved in our highest resolution ( 8.5 and 15 ghz ) images though these are the frequencies at which the jet is faintest .",
    "we set an upper limit to their angular sizes ( diameters ) of 0.2  based on these data .",
    "lastly , a new radio knot is found in the highest resolution ( 15 ghz ) image 0.4  from the nucleus ( k0.4 ) .",
    "though not well - separated from the nucleus in the lower - resolution images , some excess emission presumably from k0.4 is seen connecting the core to the outer jet in all three lower - frequency maps ( figure  [ figure-2 ] ) .",
    "its identification in the 15 ghz data helps delineate the overall ( projected ) path of the radio jet from parsec - scales ( out to @xmath210.1 ; ",
    "[ section - vlbi ] ) to kiloparsec scales (   [ section - describe ] ) .      a deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) image of 1745 + 624 was obtained from the stsci archive to search for optical emission from the jet .",
    "the data analyzed was taken with stis using the ccd in clear ( unfiltered ) imaging mode .",
    "this image is sensitive over a broad range in the optical band ( @xmath132,00010,000  ) with an effective wavelength of 5,740  .",
    "four roughly equal exposures totaling just under 3,000 sec .",
    "( table  [ table-1 ] ) were aligned , then cosmic - ray rejected and combined using the crreject task in the stsdas package in iraf .",
    "the quasar appears prominently in the image and has slightly saturated the inner few ccd pixels ( the following description follows figure  [ figure-4 ] closely ) . in the vicinity of the radio jet",
    ", a faint resolved optical source is apparent just north of the jet ( between k1.8 and the hot spot ) , but it is clearly unassociated with the extended radio source .",
    "we modeled the central source with a series of elliptical isophotes using the ellipse task in iraf , successfully out to @xmath131.2 .",
    "other than a clear source @xmath130.95  roughly south of the quasar , this subtraction revealed the alluded to optical emission apparently coincident with k0.4 .",
    "as this is adjacent to the central mildly saturated source , and similar features at two different position angles about the nucleus are also seen in the subtracted image ( one is lined up with the direction of a diffraction spike ) , it is difficult to gauge its reality .",
    "it is formally a 5@xmath22 detection in a 0.15  radius circular aperture ( contains 79@xmath4 of encircled energy ) in the central source subtracted image ( figure  [ figure-4 ] ) , where @xmath22 here is the standard deviation in the background in apertures adjacent to the jet .",
    "some of the optical emission may indeed originate from the radio source ; its radio - to - optical spectra index of @xmath131 ( table  [ table-2 ] ) is quite typical in quasar jets @xcite , so we tentatively identify it as an optical counterpart to the radio knot k0.4 .",
    "this knot is unresolved from the nucleus in the _ chandra _ image so is not discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "we analyzed the outer knots and hot spot similarly with 0.2  radius apertures ( 87@xmath4 encircled energy ) centered on the radio positions in the unprocessed image and found no net positive signal .",
    "measurements of the poisson noise in these apertures result in a formal 3@xmath22 point source detection limit of 0.01 @xmath23jy .",
    "however , experience with similarly configured stis clear imaging data @xcite allow us to more practically gauge detection limits for such jet knots  we favor the more conservative 3@xmath22 limit of 0.06 @xmath23jy derived from the previously published work .",
    "an extinction correction of 10@xmath4 was estimated using ned s quoted values from the @xcite maps and though basically negligible , has been applied to the optical measurements ( table  [ table-2 ] ) .",

    "the source was placed 30  from the default aim - point position on the acis - s backside illuminated ccd , chip s3 ( proposers observatory guide , pog ) . the data were collected in a full readout mode of 6 ccds resulting in 3.241 seconds readout time .",
    "the quasar s count rate of 0.056  cts  s@xmath7 gives 6 - 7@xmath4 pileup in the core for this choice of the readout mode .",
    "after standard filtering , the effective exposure time for this observation was 18,312  sec ( table  [ table-1 ] ) .",
    "the x - ray data analysis was performed with the ciao  3.2 software using calibration files from the caldb3 database .",
    "we ran acis_process_events to remove pixel randomization and to obtain the highest resolution image data .",
    "the x - ray position of the quasar ( r.a.= 17 46 14.057 , decl.= + 62 26 54.79 ; j2000.0 equinox ) agrees with the radio position to better than 0.2@xmath24 , which is smaller than _ chandra _",
    "s 90@xmath4 pointing accuracy of 0.6  @xcite .",
    "the x - ray images were rebinned to 1/4 the native acis pixel - size of 0.492  in the final image ; the extended x - ray jet is already quite obvious in this image ( figure  [ figure-5 ] ) .    to determine the extent of the psf at the location of the quasar , we ran a ray - trace using the _ chandra _ ray tracer ( chart ) and then marx to create a high s / n simulation of a point source .",
    "we modeled the quasar core as a point source with the energy spectrum given by the spectral fitting described below .",
    "for the simulation , we added 7@xmath4 errors to account for uncertainty in the ray - trace model @xcite .",
    "we then extracted a radial profile from both the _ chandra _ data and the simulated point source image assuming annuli separated by 0.45  and centered on the quasar .",
    "the psf was normalized to match the peak surface brightness of the core .    a comparison between the quasar profile and the simulated psf shows an excess of counts above the psf beginning at @xmath25  from the quasar centroid .",
    "therefore , in our analysis of the quasar s core x - ray emission (   [ section - core ] ) , we define a 1.2  radius circular region centered on the x - ray centroid which excludes any overlap with the region defined for the extended jet . for our analysis of the extended emission (   [ section - xjet ] ) , we defined two pie - shaped regions based on the radio images ",
    "one for the jet , and another for the terminal hot spot .",

    "a total of 1,132 counts are detected in this region corresponding to 1,107.6@xmath26 net counts .",
    "we fit the spectrum between 0.3 and 7  kev with an absorbed power law model assuming the photoelectric absorption model with abundance tables from @xcite .",
    "our analysis included the pileup model specified by @xcite , which gives the fraction of piled photons within 69@xmath4 .",

    "assuming energy equipartition as in the jet , and a cylindrical geometry for the emitting region with radius @xmath136 kpc (   [ section - radio ] ) and similar length , we calculate the hot spot magnetic field , @xmath137 @xmath23 g .",
    "this also is in rough agreement ( though again slightly higher ) with the minimum energy magnetic fields derived for the other knots @xcite .    the equipartition magnetic energy density of the hot spot , @xmath138 erg@xmath75 , is more than one order of magnitude greater than the energy density of the cmb radiation at the quasar s redshift",
    "however , the energy density of the synchrotron photons thereby , @xmath139 erg@xmath75 , is roughly comparable to @xmath140 . in this evaluation",
    ", we took the hot spot radio spectral index , @xmath141 , its synchrotron luminosity @xmath142 , the geometry as described above , and neglected relativistic corrections .",
    "the implied 1 kev flux of the hot spot due to the ssc plus ic / cmb processes is then @xmath130.18 njy ( equation  [ equation - ssc ] ) . as in the jet emission (   [ section - basic ] ) ,",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed x - ray flux , though here the deviation is less drastic ( factor of @xmath1314 ; table  [ table-2 ] ) .",
    "however , one should keep in mind many of the underlying assumptions in such calculations before claiming a true disagreement between model predictions and the observations .",
    "in particular , the hot spot structure is in fact unresolved , hence a slightly smaller volume than considered , together with , e.g. small deviations from energy equipartition and spectral curvature ( see below ) , could foreseeably bring the measurement into better agreement with the model prediction",
    ".    however , if we take the observed excess in x - rays over the estimated ssc flux at face value , this would not be the first such case for a hot spot .",
    "@xcite has argued for a synchrotron origin of this x - ray excess in many local hot spot sources , though in the case of 1745 + 624 , the optical upper limit precludes a straightforward extrapolation of the ( very steep ) radio spectrum up to the x - ray band . on the other hand , @xcite has argued that there is an ic / cmb contribution from an underlying relativistic portion of the jet terminus ( unresolved by our observations ) to the few x - ray detected hot spots studied in several @xmath143 quasars .",
    "the latter possibility is quite attractive in the case of 1745 + 624 : as we noted earlier , the terminal jet feature in this source does not have typical hot spot - like radio polarization properties , and there could very well be an unresolved portion of the jet mixed in .",
    "if the multi - band radiative output of k2.5 is dominated by a relativistic jet flow , this would imply @xmath71=5 for an ic / cmb origin of the x - ray flux ( using equation  [ equation - iccmb ] with all the parameters discussed above ) .",
    "this beaming factor is quite high , though comparable to values derived in lower - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "it is also slightly higher than the values obtained for the proper jet ( knots k1.4 and k1.8 ; see   [ section - beamed ] ) , though again , there are the usual uncertainties in these calculations to keep in mind .",
    "regardless , the problem of terminal x - ray / radio knots in this and many quasar jets can be viewed as a simple extension of that in the jet knots .    one relevant issue in this discussion is the apparent lack of a hot spot on the side opposite of the nucleus to the prominent jet .",
    "if the advance speed of the jet is sub - relativistic , then some emission should have been visible on the counter - jet side .",
    "this can be reconciled by the fact that the usually inferred ( sub - relativistic ) advance speeds of hot spots in powerful radio sources assume that the jet thrust is balanced with the ram - pressure of the ambient material within a typical galaxy group / poor cluster environment @xcite . however",
    ", if the jets propagate into the radio cocoon formed in a previous epoch of radio activity , i.e. in an environment with a substantially decreased number density and pressure , the advance velocity of the jet may be close to @xmath66 .",
    "in such a case , combined doppler and light - travel effects may result in an apparent lack of a visible counter hot spot .",
    "such a scenario was proposed by @xcite for the 3c  273 jet .",
    "since the observed properties of 1745 + 624 and 3c  273 radio quasars are so similar , one could also apply this argument to explain the lack of emission visible on the counter - jet side in 1745 + 624 .",
    "let us finally discuss yet another issue regarding this dominant radio feature , namely the extrapolation of its radio spectrum to lower frequencies . as discussed in ",
    "[ section - beamed ] , an extrapolation of its observed @xmath13@xmath144 ghz continuum @xmath145 to lower frequencies exceeds the extrapolation of the flat - spectrum core component @xmath146 at about @xmath147 mhz , and joins smoothly with the observed integrated low frequency emission at @xmath148 mhz ( see figure  [ figure-7 ] [ left ] ) . in other words",
    ", one can attribute the @xmath1330300 mhz integrated emission to the extended radio structure . since the extended emission",
    "is probably dominated by the brightest feature , the hot spot ( we can not exclude a contribution from the fainter inner jet ;   [ section - beamed ] ) , this would imply a broken power - law character of its synchrotron spectrum , @xmath149 for @xmath150 mhz and @xmath145 for @xmath151 mhz . in the standard continuous - injection model of terminal features in powerful jets",
    "@xcite , the spectral break would correspond to the energies , @xmath152 .",
    "this low - frequency break is expected in face of the large computed hot spot equipartition magnetic field , @xmath137 @xmath23 g ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the multiwavelength emissions of the 1745 + 624 jet allow us to estimate the kinetic power of the outflowing plasma in this source .",
    "the kinetic power of the ultrarelativistic electrons and magnetic field characterizing the proper jet , under the minimum - power hypothesis , is roughly @xmath153 , where @xmath154 kpc is the jet radius and @xmath155 erg s@xmath7 is the jet comoving magnetic field energy density , as discussed in   [ section - discussjet ] .",
    "assuming for illustration , a jet viewing angle @xmath156 ( see   [ section - describe ] ) and jet bulk lorentz factor at the kpc - scale @xmath157 ( leading to the ` comfortable ' value of the jet doppler factor @xmath158 ) , one obtains a kinematic factor @xmath159 , and therefore a jet kinetic luminosity ( regarding solely ultrarelativistic jet electrons and the jet magnetic field ) @xmath160 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "if we regard the terminal feature as a `` true '' hot spot , we can estimate the kinetic energy of the jet .",
    "we approximate the broad - band synchrotron spectrum of the hot spot by a broken power - law : @xmath149 between the assumed minimum synchrotron frequency @xmath161 mhz and the break frequency @xmath162 mhz , followed by @xmath163 between @xmath164 and the assumed maximum synchrotron frequency @xmath165 hz ( see   [ section - hotspot ] ) . the radiative efficiency factor ,",
    "i.e. the ratio of the power emitted by the hot spot electrons via synchrotron radiation , and the total power injected to these electrons at the terminal shock , is :    @xmath166    the reconstructed radio continuum of the hot spot implies also its total synchrotron luminosity @xmath167 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , the total kinetic power of the jet transported from the active center to the jet terminal point is roughly :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is the fraction of the jet kinetic energy transformed in the terminal shock to the internal energy of ultrarelativistic ( i.e. synchrotron emitting ) electrons . in the case of energy equipartition between the electrons and the magnetic field",
    "reached at the hot spot , one should expect very roughly @xmath170 ( see * ? ? ? * for a wider discussion ) .",
    "this gives @xmath171 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "in fact , @xmath172 should be regarded as an upper limit , keeping in mind a possible proton contribution and work done by the outflow in pushing out the ambient medium , making @xmath3 erg s@xmath7 a safe lower limit for the kinetic power of the 1745 + 624 jet .",
    "the jet power estimated at the beginning of this subsection is an order of magnitude lower than its total kinetic power constrained from the hot spot emission .",
    "this may indicate a dynamical role of non - radiating jet particles ( either cold electrons or protons ; see in this context , * ? ? ?",
    "let us compare the kinetic power of the 1745 + 624 jet estimated above with the accretion parameters of the quasar core .",
    "due to the large distance of the quasar , and hence related observational difficulties , these accretion parameters can not be evaluated precisely thus should be treated with some caution .",
    "nevertheless , we note @xcite and @xcite found a broad emission civ line in the spectrum of the 1745 + 624 quasar at the observed wavelength @xmath173  , and an observed @xmath174  .",
    "this gives the intrinsic velocity dispersion :    @xmath175    @xcite reported also a steep - spectrum ( @xmath176 ) , non - variable and low - polarized optical continuum of the 1745 + 624 quasar , which we consider below as being produced by the circumnuclear gas solely .",
    "in other words , we assume that the host galaxy and the nuclear portion of the jet do not contribute significantly to the observed optical emission of the discussed object . at the observed wavelength @xmath177  ,",
    "corresponding to the source rest frame wavelength @xmath178  , the detected continuum flux is @xmath179 mjy .",
    "thus , the intrinsic continuum luminosity at the emitted frequency @xmath178  , is simply @xmath180_{6600 } \\approx 5.4 \\times 10^{46}$ ] erg s@xmath7 .",
    "these estimates allow us to find the bolometric luminosity of the quasar core ( assumed to be about ten times the @xmath181-band core luminosity ) , @xmath182 erg s@xmath7 , as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole via the virial relation @xcite :    @xmath183    this can be taken as a lower limit in this case because the relation was calibrated for the broad component of the civ line , which was not measured independently from the narrow one @xcite ; including the latter underestimates the measured broad - line width @xcite which could be @xmath143,000 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding eddington luminosity is @xmath184 erg s@xmath7 and the eddington ratio , @xmath185 .",
    "the latter is quite large and may indicate contribution of the emission due to an unresolved portion of the jet to the nuclear optical continuum produced by the accreting matter .",
    "finally , the total observed @xmath186 ghz flux of the 1745 + 624 radio source ( 780.6 mjy ; * ? ? ? * ) , gives the total monochromatic radio luminosity @xmath187 erg s@xmath7 thus a radio loudness parameter , @xmath188 .",
    "note that the discussed object , which possesses the most powerful observed radio jet known , is extremely ` radio - loud ' , as the standard division between radio - quiet and radio - loud sources @xcite is @xmath189 . with the obtained values of the eddington ratio and radio loudness ,",
    "1745 + 624 fits into the ` radio - loud ' trend formed on the @xmath190 plane by local ( @xmath191 ) fr i radio galaxies and radio selected broad - line agns , as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed multi - frequency radio , optical and x - ray imaging data for the kpc - scale jet in the @xmath0=3.89 quasar 1745 + 624 .",
    "this quasar hosts the most powerful large - scale radio and x - ray jet yet observed , with monochromatic radio and x - ray luminosities , @xmath192 erg s@xmath7 and @xmath193 erg s@xmath7 , respectively ( excluding emission from the powerful terminal `` hot spot '' ) . aside from its large radiative output , and related large inferred equipartition magnetic field ( in comparison to local powerful jet sources ) , its properties ( multi - wavelength morphology , radio polarization , and broad - band spectral energy distribution ) are broadly similar to other lower - redshift quasar jets .",
    "this is unexpected in light of the dramatic increase in the cmb energy density and strong cosmic evolution of the intergalactic medium at such high - redshifts ; this should have manifested in a dramatically different appearance of such large - scale outflows .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of the resolved linear structures are discussed . in this jet ,",
    "inverse - compton scattered emission on the cmb photons can just account for the x - ray emission if the jet is inclined close to our line of sight ( @xmath6910 ) and if it is also moving relativistically , @xmath70=23 .",
    "several indirect arguments from the multi - scale radio observations of 1745 + 624 support such values of the large - scale jet kinematic parameters .",
    "the data are also consistent with a synchrotron interpretation provided the electron acceleration timescale is much shorter than that of the radiative losses , which we deem likely",
    ". the main distinguishing feature of the two models should manifest in drastically different x - ray / radio emission properties of such high - redshift jets though with only three current @xmath13 examples , no trends are yet apparent .    via the virial relation",
    ", we estimate that a @xmath194 supermassive black hole resides at the center of this galaxy .",
    "the broad - band emission of the extended components allow us to additionally estimate a jet kinetic power of @xmath195 ergs@xmath7 , which is a small fraction of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath196 ) corresponding to this black hole mass .",
    "as the bolometric luminosity of the quasar is @xmath197 , the inferred jet kinetic power seems to be much less than the estimated accretion power . despite this , the 1745 + 624 quasar , hosting the most powerful radio jet known , is extremely ` radio - loud ' in comparison to more local radio selected quasars with a radio - loudness parameter @xmath198 , and is surprisingly similar to local radio selected broad line agns regarding the accretion parameters .",
