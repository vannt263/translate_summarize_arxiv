    "low crosstalk intersections of optical waveguides are key components in compact and high dense optical integrated circuits . usually , the intersection of two crossing waveguides should be designed and optimized properly , or large crosstalk and reflection may be appear . for the intersections formed by two conventional planar waveguides , mode expander structures may be used to decrease crosstalk and reflection ( intersection # 0).@xcite for the intersections of line defect waveguides in photonic crystals ( pcs),@xcite several designs have been proposed:@xcite previously , the two crossing pc line defect waveguides are coupled to a common resonator ( a point defect ) ( intersection # 1 ) , and the proper symmetry of the resonator s mode ensures the low crosstalk between the two crossing waveguides.@xcite subsequently , this idea is used to design the crossing of two _ modified _ planar waveguides ( with cavities or cuts in them).@xcite however , due to the single mode property of the resonator , only one operation frequency ( the frequency can be tuned by the resonator ) is demonstrated to be low crosstalk in ref .. recently , s. lan and h. ishikawa proposed a broad bandwidth operation of line defect pc waveguide intersections by replacing the single resonator of intersection # 1 with a coupled cavity structure ( intersection # 2).@xcite due to the wide broadband transmission band of the ccw,@xcite broad bandwidth operation of low crosstalk intersection is numerically verified in a triangle lattice pc structure , @xcite which is also valid for ultrashort ( about 500-fs ) pulse transmission for the broadband property .",
    "more recently , a new design and optimization of line defect pc waveguide crossing based on wannier basis is investigated in a square lattice ( intersection # 3).@xcite the bandwidth of the optimized crossing is very high ( @xmath1 ) , and crosstalk is very low ( @xmath2db).@xcite    apart from the line defect waveguide , another important kind of waveguide in pc is the coupled cavity waveguide ( ccw).@xcite although many novel optical functional elements based on ccw structure have been proposed , such as the optical power splitter,@xcite band drop filter,@xcite nonlinear enhancement,@xcite optical delay lines@xcite and optical bistable switching and limiting,@xcite the intersections of ccws have not been investigated deeply .",
    "in fact , the intersection # 2 of _ hybrid waveguides _ structure in ref . is a design for two crossing ccws .",
    "generally speaking , all the intersections mentioned above are all based on the orthogonality of the field pattern of one waveguide in the intersection area with respect to the other crossing waveguide . therefore , the cavities of intersection # 1 should be multi - pole mode , and a mono - pole mode is not suitable for low crosstalk intersection.@xcite when a ccw is used , the intersection using the mono - pole mode of the cavity is also impossible.@xcite    in this paper , we report a new mechanism of low crosstalk intersection of two ccws , which are formed by sequences of _ mono - mode _ cavities in a square lattice pc structure . although the individual cavities are mono - mode , the _ supermodes _ ( result from the strong coupling between cavities ) of the ccw may be dipole - like , which ensures the low crosstalk between the two intersecting ccws , and the working frequencies can be tuned easily .",
    "it s reported that the eigenfrequency spectra of ccw structures follow into two different shapes:@xcite one is a continuous band and the other is a series of @xmath3 ( the number of cavities ) discrete modes.@xcite and the shapes of the spectrum depend on the coupling strength between cavities.@xcite    for the continuous spectrum modes , the coupling between neighboring cavities is weak , and the tight binding theory gives a complete description.@xcite while for the discrete modes , the coupling between neighboring cavities is strong , and we surprisingly find that a coupled mode theory may be used to predict the eigenfrequencies , mode profiles and as well as the quality factors of each supermodes.@xcite    in the coupled mode theory , the electric field of the overall ccw is expressed by the superposition of the individual cavity modes with the superposition coefficients of arbitrary complex numbers of @xmath4 : @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the total number of cavities , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the eigenfrequencies of an individual cavity and that of the coupled system . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the eigenmodes of an individual cavity and that of the ccw . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distance between two neighboring cavities and the unit vector of the alignment direction of the cavities , respectively . substituting eq .",

    ", one can obtain a group of coupled linear equations about the coefficients of @xmath4 . solving the equation group , one obtain @xmath3 allowed supermodes for the ccw system . for the @xmath13th ( @xmath14 ) mode , the superposition coefficients @xmath15 are : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a normalized constant . for the details of the coupled mode theory ,",

    "i.e. , @xmath21 with @xmath22 an integer , one can find that the amplitude of the central ( @xmath23th , @xmath24 ) cavity of the @xmath13th supermodes are @xmath25 .",

    "[ fig : eina ] and fig .",

    "[ fig : tb ] respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    according to the above discussion and numerical results , one can find that the number of cavity @xmath3 ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) affects the performance of the intersection greatly .",
    "only the type - a and type - b structures can eliminate the crosstalk efficiently , i.e. , the @xmath45 and @xmath46 must be both odd integers or both be even integers . if one of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is odd and the other is even , then low crosstalk is impossible for the mode symmetry of the supermodes .",
    "another condition for the low crosstalk intersection is that the two ccws must be overlap at the center and perpendicular to each other .",
    "although only a small number of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is discussed , one can straightly extend to the case of large values of @xmath3 ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",

    "suppose the average linewidth of each mode is @xmath74 and the bandwidth of the ccw is about @xmath75 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath3 is @xmath76 , and the maximum number of low crosstalk frequencies is @xmath77 $ ] ( @xmath78 $ ] means the integer part of a number ) .",
    "the bandwidth of the ccw can be tuned by changing the coupling of neighboring cavities.@xcite and the linewidth of each mode can be tuned by the confinement of the cavities.@xcite for the case of supermodes of ccw , the couple between cavities is much stronger than the case of continuous modes , therefore the bandwidth of @xmath75 is very large . for the structures demonstrated in this paper , the bandwidth ( bandwidth to center frequency ratio @xmath79 ) is about @xmath80 , which is much larger than the bandwidth demonstrated before.@xcite    in this paper , the reflection spectrum is not considered .",
    "although the maximum normalized transmission power is only @xmath81 ( @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb ] ) , we belive that the reflection mainly originates from the coupling of the ccw and the incident source , but not from the existence of the intersection .",
    "the reflectance can be optimized using some tapered structure,@xcite or using some novel optimization algorithm.@xcite    finally , we want to point out that for the other eigenfrequencies ( corresponding to the cases of @xmath82 for the case of @xmath36 or @xmath83 for the case of @xmath21 ) , due to the symmetry of the mode profiles , the coupling of the two ccws is strong . and",
    "this results in the supermodes split into more than one supermodes , and the crosstalk of them are all very high .",
    "in fact , the crosstalk are at the same level as the transmission power .",
    "therefore , for these modes , the intersection structure performs just like a 1-to-3 power splitter , rather than a low crosstalk intersection .",
    "in summary , we have investigated low crosstalk intersections of two ccws that are composed by mono - mode cavities in a square lattice pc structures . the desired mode symmetry ( orthogonal to the perpendicular ccw )",
    "is achieved by the combination of all the cavities but not a single cavity near the intersection .",
    "our results show that for a cavity number of @xmath3 , there are @xmath84 $ ] ( the integer part of @xmath85 ) frequencies are low crosstalk .",
    "we analyzed the mode profiles using a coupled mode theory , and obtained the transmission and crosstalk spectra using fdtd method .",
    "we also obtained the electric field distributions at stable states of the low crosstalk modes , from which we analyzed the physical mechanism of low crosstalk .",
