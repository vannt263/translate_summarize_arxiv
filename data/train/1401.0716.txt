    "by the middle of next decade , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) will be in the midst of a decade - long sky survey , en route to producing a deep , multi - color view of the sky and generating potentially a million alerts nightly .",
    "radio wavelength observations will provide independent , complementary views of the sky , and they will be crucial for full exploitation of the lsst data products . a community workshop , hosted by the national radio astronomy observatory in charlottesville , ( 2013 may  68 ) , was held to explore the science themes of time domain radio astronomy and the radio components of multi - wavelength sky surveys , with the aim of identifying emerging scientific and technical capabilities needed for conducting observations in these areas .",
    "the focus of this workshop was primarily on centimeter- and meter - wavelength observations ( @xmath0  mhz50  ghz ) .",
    "this document is intended to capture the key conclusions and recommendations of that community workshop .",
    "section  [ sec : landscape ] ( and appendix  [ app : landscape ] ) summarizes the likely radio astronomy landscape by the middle of next decade , section  [ sec : time ] discusses the complementary nature of radio astronomical observations and lsst observations , section  [ sec : survey ] describes radio wavelength surveys and their complementary nature to the lsst survey , and section  [ sec : future ] summarizes other topics of discussion at the workshop .",
    "appendix  [ app : lsst ] summarizes lsst data products , appendix  [ app : surveys ] describes potential future radio surveys , and appendix  [ app : who ] lists the workshop participants .",
    "observations at centimeter- to meter wavelengths have been responsible for the discovery of many of the objects and much of the phenomena studied in modern astronomy and have resulted in the awarding of three nobel prizes in physics .",
    "discoveries include the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , quasars , pulsars , indirect evidence for gravitational waves , astrophysical masers , cosmic magnetic fields , non - thermal emission mechanisms ( specifically synchrotron radiation ) , and the jets from black holes and other objects .",
    "moreover , the use of aperture synthesis techniques  also recognized by the nobel committee  has enabled observations at radio wavelengths to reach unprecedented levels of imaging resolution and astrometric precision not attained in any other wavelength band , providing the fuel for further discovery .",
    "technological developments over the latter half of the @xmath1 century , often stimulated by commercial considerations , offer a path to substantial improvements in future radio astronomical instrumentation . among the range of improvements",
    "are mass production of centimeter - wavelength antennas , fiber optics for the transmission of large volumes of data , high - speed digital signal processing hardware for the analysis of the signals , and computational improvements leading to massive processing and storage . applying these new technologies to radio astronomy can open up an enormous expanded volume of discovery space",
    ". a vigorous international program of upgrading existing radio telescopes and constructing new ones has been stimulated by the potential of applying these technologies to radio astronomy , a process that is likely to continue at least through the current decade .",
    "while it is difficult to capture the full range of international activity , it spans much of the available parameter space for radio wavelength observations .",
    "various radio telescopes now allow access to frequencies near the ionospheric cutoff ( @xmath2  mhz ) to as high as the significant tropospheric oxygen absorption lines ( @xmath3  ghz ) .",
    "filled aperture radio telescopes are in operation providing significant surface brightness sensitivity , while interferometers , using the technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , routinely obtain sub - milliarcsecond resolutions .",
    "with modern digital signal processing , sub - microsecond time resolution has been obtained , and , in conjunction with data archives , decade - long light curves of some objects are being produced .",
    "full polarization measurements of the electric field can also be obtained routinely .",
    "even more significant expansions in one or more directions in parameter space will be enabled with future instruments , including the hydrogen epoch of reionization array ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the square kilometre array ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and a high frequency long - baseline standalone u.s .",
    "array , possibly a component of the , grown from the karl g.  jansky very large array ( jvla ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) .    appendix  [ app : landscape ] provides more quantitative information about radio telescopes likely to become operational _ before _ or during the lsst era . in the spirit of this workshop ,",
    "these summaries of telescope capabilities are intended to provoke thinking about the kinds of radio wavelength observations that could be conducted both _",
    "now _ and during the lsst era .",
    "tables  [ tab : singledish ] , [ tab : meter ] , and  [ tab : centimeter ] highlight radio telescopes either currently operational or in construction and likely to be operational in the lsst era .",
    "these tables may not be complete , and , particularly for telescopes still under construction or in commissioning , various aspects of their capabilities may change .",

    "the observatories that operate most of the telescopes listed maintain up - to - date status documents that should be consulted for the most recent values .",
    "time domain observations at radio wavelengths have a long history , with the initial theoretical prediction for the existence of neutron stars @xcite being verified by their discovery at a radio telescope that had a fortuitous combination of a wide field of view and high time resolution @xcite . since then",
    ", it has been recognized that variable and transient emissions  bursts , flares , pulses  mark compact sources or the locations of explosive or dynamic events . as such",
    ", radio transient sources offer insight into a variety of fundamental physical and astrophysical questions such as the cosmological star formation history ( through observations of supernovae and gamma - ray bursts ) , the nature of strong gravity ( through observations of radio pulsars ) , and mechanisms for efficient particle acceleration .",
    "considerable recent excitement has been generated by the report of millisecond radio bursts having properties consistent with a cosmological population of sources @xcite , suggesting that the radio sky may harbor other , yet - to - be - discovered populations of transient sources as well .",

    "radio transients can be located in the galaxy or can be extragalactic , and their emission mechanisms can be either _ incoherent _ ( e.g. , synchrotron ) or _ coherent _ ( e.g. , masers ) . for incoherent processes ,",
    "particles radiate independently ( luminosity @xmath11 , for  @xmath12 radiating particles ) , which tends to favor centimeter ( and shorter ) wavelengths by virtue of the rayleigh - jeans approximation . for coherent processes ,",
    "the emission occurs in phase , which can result from stimulated emission , such as occurs in masers , or from collective processes in which the radiating particles are `` bunched '' within a wavelength ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the wavelength of maser emission depends upon the transitions ( e.g. , , h@xmath14o ) , but collective processes tend to favor meter wavelengths because the volume within which particles can radiate in phase scales approximately as  @xmath15 . these classes are not necessarily exclusive , as some kinds of objects could potentially display incoherent and coherent emissions at different times .",
    "radio signals are also affected by their propagation through a plasma , e.g. , interplanetary medium , interstellar medium , or intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "these propagation effects tend to be strongly wavelength dependent , and are most significant for compact sources , but can produce considerable apparent time variability .",
    "in extreme cases , the propagation - induced variability can exceed 100% , producing brightness changes that far exceed any intrinsic variability .",
    "many examples of coherent and incoherent galactic radio transients are well known , as well as incoherent extragalactic sources , as shown in table  [ tab : transients ] .",
    "however , only recently have examples of coherent radio transients that are potentially located at extragalactic distances been discovered .",
    "the millisecond durations of the recently - reported fast radio bursts ( frbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require a coherent emission process @xcite ; see also @xcite for a potential earlier example of the same phenomenon .",
    "the magnitude of various propagation effects is such that they appear to have been generated at cosmological distances .",
    "it is not yet clear if they represent a previously unrecognized coherent emission from a known source population or an entirely new class of objects .",
    "however , @xcite present a cautionary tale about the determination of sources being at cosmological distances by relying solely on propagation effects , and @xcite present a model for frbs in which they originate from stars in the galaxy .",
    "incoherent synchrotron emitting radio transients and variables span the range from galactic to cosmological distances , and many have visible wavelength signatures .",
    "notable examples include active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , supernovae ( sne ) , jetted tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , x - ray binaries and microquasars , and novae .",
    "from the detection of radio wavelength synchrotron emission , it is possible to obtain positional information ( potentially with milliarcsecond localization ) , energy information ( e.g. , velocity of blastwave or relativistic outflow ) , beaming constraints , and information on the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "while radio emission from these objects has been detected over a broad frequency range , they tend to share a common evolution in frequency : generally peaking earliest at the highest radio frequencies , cascading to lower frequencies , and potentially remaining observable for months to years at the lowest frequencies ( @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "strikingly , one of the key transient targets for , type  ia sne , has never been detected at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "recent interest in these kinds of objects tends to focus on short grbs and tdes .",
    "a subset of tdes were recently discovered to launch relativistic jets , likely in a similar manner to the radio jets in agns , allowing probes of the inner environment of a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "short grbs are the leading candidates for an electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational waves by the merging of a compact binary ( e.g. , neutron stars ) , but only a few short grbs have been detected in the radio to date @xcite .",
    "indeed , possible radio counterparts to gravitational wave events may include coherent bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or incoherent emitters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or both .",
    "however , there are several challenges in observing gravitational wave counterparts , either at visible or radio wavelengths .",
    "the initial source localizations could be poor ( tens to hundreds of square degrees , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the counterparts being short and faint at visible wavelengths , and either very short ( @xmath16 milliseconds ) or occurring well after the event ( weeks to months ) and faint in the radio @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the sky appears to be far `` quieter , '' with fewer transients , at centimeter wavelengths ( radio ) than at visible wavelengths , suggesting that a radio counterpart may be the first identified counterpart to a gravitational wave event , particularly if the radio counterpart is a coherent burst .",
    "these properties demand multi - wavelength programs , with sensitive telescopes capable of covering large areas on the sky (   [ sec : survey ] , appendices  [ app : landscape ] and  [ app : lsst ] ) , and a strong synergy exists between lsst and radio surveys in identifying the electromagnetic counterpart at both visible and radio wavelengths , and the information from both wavelengths about the physics of the post - merger evolution will be complementary .",
    "incoherent stellar emission is typically in the form of flares generated as part of magnetic reconnection processes .",
    "thus , the phenomenon is applicable to all classes of magnetically active stars .",
    "sensitive time - domain surveys , such as the _ kepler _ mission , have been expanding the stellar types typically thought of for flaring , particularly to  a stars @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs have the best constraints on their multi - wavelength characteristics ( especially radio and visible wavelength ) and , with their large space densities , are expected to be a significant contributor to the transient and variable population that lsst will detect . because of the rapid timescales involved , it is not feasible to make follow - up observations , necessitating co - temporal coverage during coordinated multi - wavelength observations . examples of processes in stellar coronae that are yet to be understood include the role of particle acceleration in the production of white stellar flares as well as the upper limit on particle acceleration during large stellar reconnection events .",
    "examples of galactic coherent radio transients include neutron stars and sub - stellar objects ; there may also be coherent prompt emission associated with violent events such grbs @xcite or gravitational wave events ( e.g. , binary neutron star mergers ) .",
    "in addition to their regular pulsations , radio pulsars have long been known to have intermittent characteristics as well ( e.g. , `` nulling '' ) . the extent and multi - wavelength aspects of their intermittency is just beginning to be appreciated .",
    "radio pulsars have been found to turn off for days to weeks at a time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a radio `` quiet '' mode in psr  b0943@xmath1710 has been found to correlate with a large increase ( more than double ) in its x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the extreme of intermittency is exhibited by rotating radio transients ( rrats ) : neutron stars that produce only sporadic single radio pulses @xcite ; some rrats have been found to have x - ray counterparts as well .",
    "although coherent radio emitters are not generally considered to have visible wavelength counterparts , this situation may change in the lsst era .",
    "for instance , the annual lsst data releases , or the final ( 10  yr ) data release , may be deep enough to enable the detection of the visible wavelength emission from neutron stars , which could be identified as such by virtue of their colors and relatively high proper motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one strategy would be to confirm which , if any , known neutron stars are detected by this approach .",
    "alternatively , any neutron star candidates so identified within the lsst survey could be targeted with a deep radio search . in a similar vein , sub - stellar objects might either be identified from lsst observations or be detected first in the radio then identified in an lsst data release . as an example of the first method , nearby brown dwarf candidates could be identified in lsst by their red colors , then targeted for radio searches . as an example of the second method , searches of nearby stars for electron cyclotron maser emission , characteristic of planets ,",
    "could then use lsst data to assess whether there have been intensity ( transit ) or astrometric variations of those stars .",
    "the workshop highlighted several key points regarding follow - up observations of transients in the lsst era :    * x- and @xmath18-ray telescopes , like those on _ swift _ and _ fermi _ , have proven invaluable in the detection and localization of various classes of transients . in the case of _ swift _ , it is capable of surveying roughly 1/3 of the sky instantaneously and rapidly locating a burst to within a few arcseconds . during the lsst era , it is not clear that there will be a comparable u.s .",
    "x- or @xmath18-ray capability , though there may be international capability .",
    "* an all - sky radio survey , similar to , but either deeper or higher frequency , or both , is invaluable for having a `` baseline image '' and reference grid for when a transient is discovered . *",
    "two - dimensional radio interferometers can provide and are essential for obtaining precise ( @xmath19 ) positions for optical cross - identifications and redshifts . in constrast , a transient detected by a single dish can be located only within the primary beam , which is usually several arcminutes across and insufficient for localization . * using the knowledge that we have already acquired about the different types of radio transients , and their rates and time scales ( table  [ tab : transients ] ) , is likely to be an important aspect of the ability to classify lsst alerts and focus on the most unusual or more interesting events .",
    "more broadly , lsst is projected to produce as many as 12 million alerts per night .",
    "formally , an `` alert '' is simply a notification that there has been a difference between images , which may indicate a moving object ( e.g. , asteroid ) , a variable , or a transient . in order to ensure that the necessary follow - up resources",
    "can be deployed , it is essential that appropriate classifier filters be developed in order to reliably identify those alerts warranting follow - up observations . specifically , event filters need to be science - defined and have a carefully considered trade - off between completeness and purity , or between identifying most of a population ( completeness ) without being overwhelmed by false alarms ( purity ) .",
    "the community will need to develop and test appropriate classification engines based on lsst alert data products , a process that can begin now using on - going visible and near - infrared surveys .",
    "even with the most selective filters , the scientifically `` interesting '' event rate will overwhelm any plausible follow - up resources .",
    "obtaining useful classifier filters will likely be a multi - stage process , requiring a combination of the knowledge of properties of known classes of transients and high quality pre - existing survey catalogs that provide multi - wavelength information .",
    "even after stringent filtering , attempting to follow up the most interesting tip of the iceberg might still overwhelm available resources . instead of triage by default , the community and",
    "the observatories could consider defining _ which _ types , if any , of lsst alerts would warrant dedicated follow - up programs , as well as defining how such follow - up programs would be conducted .",
    "given that the lsst main survey is expected to have a well - defined cadence and schedule for observing fields , it may be possible to combine this knowledge with knowledge of radio transient time scales to do `` pre - observing '' or `` blind observing . '' for instance , if there were to be a class of radio transients for which the radio emission _ leads _ the visible wavelength emission",
    ", it would be pragmatic to observe lsst fields _ before _ the lsst observations .",
    "if the rate of such radio transients is sufficiently high , a multi - wavelength study of a transient could be conducted , even if the field in which it would be observed would not be known _ a priori_. a similar strategy has been used , to great effect , in the observations of type  ia sne with the _ hubble space telescope_.",
    "radio continuum surveys provide an unobscured view of star formation and accretion activity in galaxies out to the highest redshifts as well as a potentially powerful means of constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "nearly all discrete radio sources are extragalactic and are at cosmological distances @xmath20 , so their distribution on the sky is nearly isotropic",
    ". surveys covering large solid angles are needed to generate statistically useful samples of nearby ( @xmath21 ) radio galaxies or intrinsically rare objects ( e.g. , the most luminous quasars ) , and to make sensitive cosmological tests ( e.g. , constraining dark energy via the sachs - wolfe effect ) .",
    "radio surveys in the much smaller lsst `` deep drilling fields '' ( @xmath22  deg@xmath23 each , appendix  [ app : lsst ] ) will be sufficient for generating fair samples to study the evolution of agns and star - forming galaxies .    the power that radio continuum surveys have to constrain the cosmological model is becoming more apparent , mostly due to the high - redshift tail of the radio source populations , which are difficult to access in optical surveys . to be of maximum value ,",
    "redshifts of the objects detected in radio continuum surveys are required , but redshifts greater than unity will be difficult to obtain even in the era . the ska will measure the 21  cm line toward gas - rich galaxies , but the weakness of this line means that individual galaxies will be difficult to detect in this line at @xmath24 , and it is unlikely to be useful for gas - poor galaxies .",
    "thus , we will continue to rely on redshifts derived from optical and near - infrared instruments .",
    "the lsst s 6-band optical photometry will provide accurate photometric redshifts to @xmath25 ( based on the 4000    break spectral feature ) and to @xmath26 ( based on the lyman break spectral feature ) ; these photometric redshifts , particularly if combined with complementary near - infrared photometry , will provide much of the key data necessary to derive the evolution of activity in the universe , as traced by radio emission .",
    "the possibility of obtaining a large number of photometric redshifts for the @xmath27 radio source population with the lsst all - sky survey will allow the remaining unidentified sources to be used for probing the largest scales at the highest redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , s multiple visits will probe photometric variability to relatively faint magnitudes , providing additional information to aid in determining which objects contain an active nucleus , and can help classify agn in the deep radio continuum surveys .",
    "the k - correction of optically thin ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) synchrotron radio sources is so large that samples of @xmath30 sources may still be relatively small in number , even with sensitive surveys at traditional frequencies ( @xmath31 , but also see below ) . toward specific targets , deep",
    ", targeted observations have been essential in obtaining precise positions , and the enhanced sensitivity of the jvla improves this capability substantially .",
    "thus , it is now possible to use ultra - deep 1.4  ghz observations of well - studied fields , like the chandra deep field - north ( cdf - n ) , which has both extensive spectroscopy ( both visible wavelength and co ) and x - ray imaging data , to find substantial numbers of massive , star - forming galaxies to the highest redshifts . at higher frequencies ( @xmath3210  ghz ) ,",
    "the k - correction of free - free emission is more favorable .",
    "surveys at these frequencies could have a high yield of intense star - forming galaxies at @xmath30 , for which the ( rest - frame ) free - free emission would be the direct result of the ionizing activity of massive stars .",
    "most radio sources stronger than @xmath33  mjy at  1.4  ghz are powered by supermassive black holes in agns , while star forming galaxies increasingly dominate the population of fainter sources .",
    "the radio emission from a star forming galaxy is roughly co - extensive with the star formation region , so the median angular size of faint sources is no more than about  1 .",
    "the 1.4  ghz source counts converge rapidly below @xmath34 : the flux density of a normal galaxy at @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , instrumental confusion declines sharply for surveys with better than 10  ( fwhm ) angular resolution @xcite .",
    "`` natural '' confusion will never limit sensitivity , unless there is a previously unrecognized population of sources at microjanksy flux densities .",
    "in addition to discrete sources , at the sensitivity levels of future radio surveys , diffuse sources such as radio relics and halos in clusters of galaxies could be detected .",
    "synchrotron ageing within diffuse sources typically results in diffuse sources having steep radio spectra , necessitating a different survey strategy .",
    "relatively lower resolution surveys at frequencies lower than the `` standard '' of  1.4  ghz will be needed to maintain surface brightness sensitivity . extended or",
    "filamentary structures may also be traced by cross - correlating the radio surveys with the photometric galaxy density from the lsst survey products .",
    "radio surveys in the lsst era should be designed to match both ( 1 )  known source properties and ( 2 )  the planned lsst synoptic surveys covering the whole southern hemisphere , plus up to 30 lsst deep drilling fields covering approximately 10  deg@xmath36 each .",
    "sensitive radio surveys should have detection limits well below the median brightness temperature of star forming galaxies , @xmath37 at  1.4  ghz .",
    "for example , the 50  @xmath38jy  beam@xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) detection limit in the 10  ( fwhm ) beam of the proposed evolutionary map of the universe ( emu ) survey of the southern sky @xcite corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "the sky density of lsst galaxies with @xmath42 is so high ( about one galaxy per  25 square arcseconds ) that radio position errors of order 02 ( rms ) in each coordinate will be needed to make complete and reliable position coincidence identifications .",
    "thermal noise alone contributes errors of order 01 fwhm for @xmath40 sources , so the deepest radio surveys in the deep drilling fields may have to be made with beams as small as approximately 2 .",
    "ska precursor and pathfinder arrays ( e.g. , , , , ska phase  1 ; see appendix  [ app : landscape ] ) may attain survey speeds over portions of the radio spectrum ( below  10  ghz , in most cases below  2  ghz ) superior to that of the , but the availability of the jvla opens the possibilities of starting long - term , large - area surveys now that will be complementary to both future radio surveys and lsst surveys .",
    "there was considerable discussion of the benefits of such jvla surveys , such as earlier epochs for synoptic transient surveys , higher frequency measurements , and follow up for the lower frequency precursor surveys , and radio counterparts for the visible and near - infrared wavelength surveys that exist or are currently underway ( e.g. , the , , the palomar transient factory , catalina real time survey , _ spitzer _ extragalactic representative volume survey ) .",
    "additionally , data processing and imaging techniques can be developed and tested that will be important for enabling future arrays to realize their full potential .",
    "appendix  [ app : surveys ] gives examples of potential surveys that could be performed in the near future with the jvla and later with the ska phase  1 , taking advantage of their new capabilities , in preparation for the lsst era .    in the next few years , and complementing the timescale for any jvla surveys , the low frequency array ( lofar ) will be conducting a series of tiered surveys to explore the radio continuum sky below  300  mhz . the key aims of these surveys are to trace the evolution of activity with the deepest tiers and to constrain the cosmological model through its large - area survey .",
    "the frequencies at which lofar operates also makes it highly efficient at discovering steep - spectrum radio sources , such as radio halos and relics associated with massive and likely merging clusters of galaxies , and high - redshift radio galaxies , which typically exhibit steep spectral indices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( however , @xcite present a cautionary counter - example . )",
    "the low radio - frequencies of the lofar surveys should compensate for the large k - correction and could greatly increase the sample of candidate radio sources at @xmath43 ( and possibly into the epoch of re - ionization ) , though spectroscopic or reliable photometric redshifts will be required for conclusive identifications .",
    "while the workshop was structured around two science themes , there were several topics discussed that were relevant to both .",
    "these topics included `` co - observing , '' probabilistic detection and classification of sources , and the approach toward deep drilling fields .",
    "further , several questions were raised for which either insufficient time for full discussion existed or no consensus was reached .",
    "`` co - observing '' was described as a technique for potentially more efficient use of telescopes .",
    "the lsst may broadcast its observing schedule , allowing other observatories to know where the lsst will be pointing .",
    "in contrast to the current practice of coordinating observations among multiple , independent telescopes , `` co - observing '' effectively removes a degree of freedom in the coordination , because the lsst schedule can be treated as fixed and known .",
    "radio telescopes could visit lsst fields with the appropriate lag to find certain classes of sources .",
    "however , while identified as a possible observing mode , a specific science case or cases that would benefit explicitly from this approach was not identified .",
    "the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques for source detection and classification is not new in astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there was widespread agreement that such techniques for the probabilistic detection and classification of sources will be essential in the lsst era , if not well before .",
    "it may not be possible to determine with complete confidence whether two objects at different wavelengths ( e.g. , visible and radio ) that lie close together on the sky are in fact the same object , particularly if the flux density of one of the sources is near the detection threshold .",
    "similarly , in the early stages of some variable sources , it may not be possible to distinguish between two or more classes of objects .",
    "the locations of the deep drilling fields yet to be selected were of considerable interest .",
    "many workshop participants found the locations of the four selected deep drilling fields ( in the `` extragalactic sky '' ) to be well motivated .",
    "however , there was concern expressed that the distribution of strong radio sources in or near a deep drilling field may affect the dynamic range of the radio images that could be obtained , thereby limiting the full extent of multi - wavelength data that could be collected for them .",
    "( this issue may also affect the recently announced _ hubble",
    "_ frontier fields . )",
    "further discussion topics included the possibility of additional deep drilling fields that have yet to be selected , the need for at least one of these to be optimized for galactic targets , and the process by which input into the selection of future deep drilling fields could be provided .",
    "there was support expressed for inter - operability between software tools , such as has been developed in the virtual observatory ( vo ) context .",
    "given the multi - wavelength nature of many projects , as stressed in this workshop , the ability to integrate results from multiple surveys or observations will remain essential .",
    "further , for time domain observations , the capability to distribute notices of transients and obtain rapid response to those transients , if needed , requires communication protocols and inter - operability .",
    "more generally , the need for a better focus on topics such as long - term data management and archiving was identified . with data volumes continuing to rise ,",
    "even well before lsst becomes operational , it is increasingly essential that projects take into account how their data can be discovered , accessed , and analyzed .",
    "there was considerable support for the notion that there is groundwork that could be laid now , both in terms of time domain observations and surveys . while there exist mechanisms today for the rapid response of alerts , it is not clear that these mechanisms have been optimized , nor whether all avenues for rapid response have been identified .",
    "similarly , there will be radio telescopes capable of conducting deep observations or significant surveys well before the lsst becomes operational . identifying the science case for such surveys , and then executing them , would be important groundwork for future comparisons with lsst images .    once the lsst is operational , the resulting data set will render unusual events commonplace , and the rarest of events observable .",
    "the challenge for the community is to determine how to use the lsst and its major sister facilities to determine how to optimize the follow - up observations that will be necessary to identify , classify , and characterize those events which represent new physics ; clearly , given the size of the transient event pool , a set of stringent standards governing access to complementary facilities , both ground and space - based , will be essential to maximize the scientific output of the lsst , and to balance the ongoing operational missions of existing major facilities with time - critical follow - ups .",
    "meeting this challenge effectively will require establishing and maintaining broad communications channels between the lsst project , its sister institutions , and within the community  at a level that appears to have been relatively uncommon to date .",
    "issues which should be addressed might include identifying and setting up appropriate information flows between lsst and the complementary facilities that could be called upon to provide follow - up or concurrent data , developing trigger standards for such observations , making sure that these criteria evolve to reflect ongoing experience as the lsst refines and ramps up its observing programs , and making certain that sister observatories develop and put in place processes to maintain the _ de facto _ community ownership of the lsst transient data pool .",
    "as an example specific to , how should observing time on the jvla be allocated to follow up particularly intriguing events ? should time be granted based on standing trigger proposals ( current nrao practice ) , or be restricted to first - come / first - serve telescope time allocations only , or should nrao consider setting aside a fraction of its observing time for follow - up of lsst transient events that satisfy certain community - established criteria , with the data going immediately into the public domain , or some combination of all of the above ? while this example is specific to the nrao and the , it may have a broader resonance with the entire nature of `` target of opportunity '' or `` rapid response '' proposals and the process of time allocation at telescopes .",
    "finally , there was considerable discussion of future support . in an era of large surveys , with large numbers of people involved , how can individual investigators obtain funding or be recognized for their individual contributions ?",
    "at least in the u.s . , there is unlikely to be any program dedicated to lsst data analysis analogous to a `` guest observer '' program . among the approaches discussed , though no concrete resolution was achieved , was the question of whether it is possible to design a survey in a manner that would make it easier for researchers involved in the survey to obtain funding .",
    "we thank the national radio astronomy observatory staff who provided logistical support for this workshop , particularly k.  ransom and c.  hunsinger .",
    "part of this research was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
