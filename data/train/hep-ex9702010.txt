    "the first evidence of the central production of @xmath4 in the reaction @xmath7 is presented here .",
    "the @xmath4 was first observed in @xmath8  @xcite interactions and beautifully confirmed in low energy @xmath9 annihilations by the crystal barrel collaboration  @xcite .",
    "its properties are of current interest because it is considered a candidate to be the lowest lying glueball state  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the final state selected is that only states with quantum numbers @xmath10 are allowed to decay into @xmath2 .",
    "this not only greatly simplifies the analysis but eliminates confusion coming from all the other states .",
    "the results presented here are based on 10% of the 5 x @xmath11 events recorded by fnal e690 during fermilab s 1991 fixed target run .",
    "the data was taken at fermilab with an 800 gev proton beam on a liquid hydrogen ( @xmath12 ) target , and the e690 spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer is composed of two parts : a ) the main spectrometer ( ms ) , and b ) the beam spectrometer ( bs ) .",
    "the ms has an approximately conical geometrical acceptance with an average 700 mrad radius , good momentum resolution from about 0.2 to 15 gev/@xmath13 , a freon 114 threshold cherenkov counter with a pion threshold of 2.6 gev/@xmath13 , a time of flight system ( tof ) with @xmath14 separation up to 1.5 gev/@xmath13 , and a target veto system .",
    "neither the tof nor the cherenkov counter were used in the work presented here .",
    "the bs , used to measure the incoming and outgoing protons , has an approximately conical geometrical acceptance with an average radius of about 1 mrad , a @xmath15 resolution of 6 mev/@xmath13 , and a longitudinal momentum resolution of 425 mev/@xmath13 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum acceptance of the bs for the interacted beam ranges from approximately 650 to 800 gev/@xmath13 .",
    "the trigger required an equal number on incoming and outgoing tracks in the bs and at least one additional track in the ms .",
    "final state ( [ eq : reaction ] ) was selected by requiring a primary vertex in the @xmath12 target with two @xmath16 , an incoming beam track , and a fast forward proton .",
    "no direct measurement was made of the slow proton @xmath17 .",
    "the target veto system was used to reject events with more than a missing proton .",
    "the events were accepted when either no veto counter was on , or only one veto counter was on with the missing @xmath15 pointing to it .",
    "about 12% of the selected events were rejected with the veto system .",
    "the missing mass squared seen in figure  [ fig : mass].a shows a clear proton peak with little background ; the arrows indicate the cuts used in the event selection .",
    "the ms has essentially no acceptance for , which insures a gap of at least 3.5 units of rapidity between @xmath18 and the central products .",
    "the average rapidity gap between the @xmath2 system and @xmath17 is 2.5 units .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass].b shows the uncorrected @xmath19 distribution for the @xmath2 system , the arrows indicate the cuts used in the event selection .",
    "the @xmath20 invariant mass for the @xmath16 s has a width of @xmath21 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "no direct particle i d ( cherenkov or tof ) was used to identify the @xmath16 decay products . in about 7% of the events a @xmath16 is compatible with a @xmath22 ; these events were kept , to avoid any biases in the angular distributions .    the proton mass was assigned to the missing particle in the events that passed the cuts , then the three momenta of @xmath17 and the longitudinal momentum of @xmath18 were calculated using energy and momentum conservation .    figure  [ fig : mass].c shows the @xmath2 invariant mass for the 11182 events that passed the previous cuts and were used in the analysis .",
    "the analysis was not continued beyond 2 gev/@xmath1 because the number of events is very low .",
    "but for @xmath23 the @xmath2 invariant mass beyond 2 gev/@xmath1 is smooth , with no evidence of the @xmath24 state seen by the bes collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the reaction studied here was analyzed as a two step process : the production step in which an @xmath25 system is formed by the collision of two objects ( from now on referred to as  pomerons \" ) emitted by each of the scattered protons , and the decay step in which the object @xmath25 decays into @xmath2 .",
    "the production coordinate system was defined in the cm of the @xmath25 system , with the y - axis perpendicular to the plane of the two  pomerons \" in the overall cm , and the z - axis in the direction of the  beam pomeron \" in the @xmath25 cm .",
    "the two variables needed to specify the decay process were taken as the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath26 of one of the @xmath16 ( taken at random ) in the production coordinate system .",
    "the acceptance corrected @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions are shown in figures  [ fig : cost ] and  [ fig : phi ] .",
    "the acceptance is flat in @xmath28 , and dips near @xmath29 . on average the correction at @xmath30 ,",
    "relative to the correction at 0 , is 65% .    the five variables used to specify the production process were the transverse momenta of the slow and fast protons ( @xmath31 ) , the @xmath19 and invariant mass of the @xmath2 system , and @xmath32 , the angle between the planes of the scattered protons in the @xmath2 cm .",
    "although our 11182 events constitute a large sample , it is not large enough to bin the data in all five production variables .",
    "the present analysis was done in bins of the @xmath2 invariant mass for the @xmath19 selected region , and integrating over @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath32 .",
    "the acceptance corrected moments , defined as @xmath35 are shown in figure  [ fig : moments ] .",
    "the odd moments ( not shown ) are consistent with zero , as expected for a system of two identical bosons .",
    "the acceptance corrected mass distribution ( @xmath36 moment ) is shown in figure  [ fig : mass].d .",
    "the error bars are statistical errors only .    in the two step process considered here the @xmath25 system",
    "is formed by the interchange of two  pomerons \" and it decays afterwards independently of the two final state protons .",
    "the two  pomerons \" form a plane ; parity in the strong interactions implies that reflection in this plane should be a symmetry of the system  @xcite . therefore the amplitudes used for the partial wave analysis ( pwa ) were defined in the reflectivity basis  .",
    "since the @xmath37 and @xmath38 moments are consistent with zero ( see fig  [ fig : moments ] ) , only spherical harmonics with @xmath39 and @xmath40 were considered .",
    "the waves used were @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 :    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    waves with different reflectivity @xmath49 do not interfere .",
    "the pwa analysis was done in two different ways .",
    "first since the @xmath28 angular distributions are fairly flat only @xmath50 and @xmath51 waves were used : a ) by fitting to the @xmath27 angular distributions , and b ) by using the extended maximum likelihood method .",
    "the results of the fit to the @xmath27 angular distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : cost ] .",
    "within errors the results were the same in both cases , giving a solution that , except for two small @xmath5 wave contributions at @xmath521.3 gev/@xmath1 and @xmath521.6 gev/@xmath1 , was all @xmath3 wave .",
    "second , all four waves ( [ eq : s0]-[eq : d+ ] ) were used .",
    "the amplitudes were extracted both a ) from the moments shown in figure  [ fig : moments ] , and b ) by maximizing the extended likelihood with respect to the four wave moduli and the two relative phases @xmath53 . within errors",
    "both analyses gave the same answer .    when using the four waves ( [ eq : s0]-[eq : d+ ] ) the inherent ambiguities of a two body system are such that there are two solutions for each mass bin  .",
    "both solutions give identical moments or identical values of the likelihood . in order to continue the solutions from one mass bin to the next ,",
    "one follows the barrelet zeros . in general",
    "these zeros are complex and one lies above the real axis and the other lies below it . when the zeros cross the real axis the solutions bifurcate  . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "there is a bifurcation point at 1.58 gev/@xmath1 . before this bifurcation point",
    "there are only two solutions , one which is mostly @xmath3 wave , and another that is mostly @xmath5 wave .",
    "since at threshold the @xmath2 cross section is dominated by the presence of the @xmath54  @xcite it is possible to eliminate the solution that has a very small @xmath3 wave contribution at threshold .",
    "the remaining solution bifurcates at 1.58 gev/@xmath1 into a solution that has a large @xmath3 wave contribution ( solution one ) , and another that has a large @xmath5 wave component ( solution two ) .",
    "the solutions obtained using maximum likelihood are shown in figures  [ fig : sol1 ] and  [ fig : sol2 ] .",
    "solution one is shown in figure  [ fig : sol1 ] , and solution two in figure  [ fig : sol2 ] .",
    "the errors shown are statistical errors only .",
    "a striking feature of both solutions is the large @xmath3 wave peak observed at @xmath521.5 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath4 observed by the crystal barrel collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the mass peaks at 1.52 gev/@xmath1 instead of at 1.50 gev/@xmath1 , but this could be easily due to interference with the @xmath3 wave background .    beyond 1.58 gev/@xmath1 both solution one and two",
    "are equally valid , and at the moment there is no way to decide with this data alone which of the two solutions is the correct one .",
    "however , given that beyond 1.58 gev/@xmath1 the angular distributions are fairly structureless , and that an analysis in @xmath27 alone gives very little @xmath5 wave , solution one could be favored .",
    "a pwa analysis in a sample of 11182 centrally produced @xmath2 events at 800 gev has been presented .",
    "two solutions have been found in the analysis . in both of them",
    "a clear @xmath4 has been observed .",
    "the ambiguity above 1.58 gev/@xmath1 prevents a unique determination of the spin of the @xmath6 meson . due to lack of statistics",
    "the analysis was not carried out beyond 2 gev/@xmath1 , but the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum is smooth beyond that point and shows no sign of the @xmath24 meson seen by the bes collaboration  @xcite .",
