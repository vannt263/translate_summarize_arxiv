    "<S> an earlier measurement on the 4@xmath0 to 2@xmath0 radiative transition in @xmath1be provided the first electromagnetic signature of its dumbbell - like shape . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large uncertainty in the measured cross section does not allow a stringent test of nuclear structure models . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper reports a more elaborate and precise measurement for this transition , via the radiative capture in the @xmath2he+@xmath2he reaction , improving the accuracy by about a factor of three . </S>",
    "<S> the _ ab initio _ calculations of the radiative transition strength with improved three - nucleon forces are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are compared with the predictions of the alpha cluster model and _ ab initio _ calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus @xmath1be is a classic example of the occurrence of alpha clustering  @xcite in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> its formation from two alpha particles provides an intermediate step in the synthesis of @xmath3c  @xcite from the fusion of three alpha particles inside the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus is also the stepping stone to understand alpha - clustering in heavier self - conjugate 4n nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the dumbbell - shaped nucleus exhibits rotational states manifested as resonances in the alpha - alpha scattering system . the electromagnetic transition between the excited resonant states in @xmath1be , with spin - parities of 4@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> was reported earlier  @xcite in order to provide a test for its alpha cluster structure . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were made at two beam energies , on and off the 4@xmath0 resonance , by detecting the transition gamma rays in coincidence with the two alpha particles arising from the decay of the 2@xmath0 final state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the measured cross section ( with an uncertainty of @xmath433% ) and the inferred reduced electromagnetic transition rate were not precise enough to provide a stringent test for various models like the cluster model  @xcite and _ ab initio _ quantum monte carlo model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty arose mainly due to the large background of 4.44  mev gamma rays originating from the interaction of the incident beam with the window of the chamber holding the helium gas target . </S>",
    "<S> the present work , using essentially the same method , is aimed at a more accurate measurement and also at more beam energies straddling the 4@xmath0 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the essential aspects in this improved measurement are a better pixelisation of the alpha particle detectors , a more efficient and segmented gamma ray detector and a better shielding of the gamma rays from the beam - window interaction mentioned above .        </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was carried out using beams of @xmath2he from the barc - tifr pelletron linac facility at tifr , mumbai at energies of 19@xmath529 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the beam current was about 1  pna on the target . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-rays were detected in a bgo detector array with a photopeak efficiency of about 23% at e@xmath7=8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the array consisted of 38 hexagonal cross section detectors , of length 76  mm and a face to face distance of 56 and 58  mm ( in two groups ) , encased in thin aluminum housing . </S>",
    "<S> these were mounted in close packed groups of 19 each placed at @xmath470  mm above and below the target . </S>",
    "<S> alpha particles were detected in a 500  @xmath8 m thick , annular , and double sided silicon strip detector ( sisd ) , with 2@xmath916  @xmath10 rings ( in left and right halves ) and 16  @xmath11 sectors  @xcite with separate readouts . </S>",
    "<S> the active portion of the detector had an inner diameter of 48  mm and an outer diameter of 96  mm . </S>",
    "<S> the gap between the adjacent rings was 0.1  mm while that between adjacent sectors was 0.2  mm . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right halves of the @xmath10 side were separated by 0.4  mm .    </S>",
    "<S> = 22.4 mev for a particular ring of the sisd . </S>",
    "<S> elastic and inelastic peaks ( from the first excited states ) from the @xmath3c and @xmath12o targets are indicated . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a chamber was designed to mount the strip detector at @xmath470 mm from its centre in the forward direction and to hold the target helium gas ( purity @xmath1399.9% ) at @xmath40.8  bar pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the gas was isolated from the beam line vacuum using @xmath41  mg/@xmath14 kapton foils at the entry and the exit . </S>",
    "<S> the helium gas was filled using a gas handling setup similar to that used earlier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conical heavymet shields surrounded the kapton windows in order to shield the bgo detector array from the copious 4.44  mev @xmath6-rays produced in the excitation of @xmath3c in the windows . </S>",
    "<S> the chamber had the provision to mount a ladder for holding a thick aluminum aperture plate with a hole of 24  mm diameter as well as thin mylar and carbon foils . </S>",
    "<S> the aperture plate , when placed at the centre of the target chamber , shielded the @xmath15-particles scattered from the kapton entrance window and limited the effective beam - target interaction zone seen by the sisd . the aperture diameter and the sisd distance were decided on the basis of a monte carlo simulation  @xcite to get a reasonable efficiency for the detection of two @xmath15-particles following the radiative capture and subsequent decay of the final state in @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> the typical effective target length was about 20  mm and the efficiency for the 2-@xmath15 detection from the final state was about 35% , after including the effect of the various dead zones in the sisd .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy and timing signals of the sisd were generated from each of the 32 @xmath10-rings ( divided into two groups of the left and right halves ) and 16 @xmath11-sectors . </S>",
    "<S> the energy signals were sent to voltage sensitive analog - to - digital converters . </S>",
    "<S> each timing signal was fanned out into two paths one being used to generate the overall particle event trigger for left rings , right rings and the sectors using a logical or condition among the corresponding signals . in the other path </S>",
    "<S> the signals were fed to time to digital converters  ( tdcs ) for measuring timing with respect to the @xmath6-ray detector array . </S>",
    "<S> the anode signal from the photomultiplier of each of the 38 bgo detectors was also fanned out for measuring the energy deposited by a charge - to - digital converter and for the timing measurement with respect to the sisd using tdcs . a logical or condition among the 38 signals produced the @xmath6-ray event trigger . </S>",
    "<S> the grand event trigger was generated by requiring a fast coincidence between event triggers from the left and right halves of the sisd @xmath10-rings and that from the bgo - detector array . </S>",
    "<S> the data were collected in an event by event mode using a camac based data acquisition  ( daq ) system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a 10   hz pulser signal was fanned out and given to the test input of the three sisd preamplifiers for estimating the dead time of the daq system .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy calibration of the sisd detector was done using elastic and inelastic scattering of @xmath15-particles on @xmath3c and @xmath12o using thin carbon and mylar targets . </S>",
    "<S> a typical @xmath15-particle energy spectrum is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy calibration was performed over the 256 ( 16@xmath916 ) @xmath16 pixels . </S>",
    "<S> the 4.44  mev and 6.13  mev @xmath6-rays from excited states in @xmath3c and @xmath12o populated through the inelastic @xmath15-particle scattering were used to calibrate the bgo detectors . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements were made periodically throughout the experiment in order to track the possible change in the calibrations of the @xmath15-particle and @xmath6-ray detectors . </S>",
    "<S> a stability within @xmath41% was witnessed over the period of the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> the data were collected at four beam energies of 19.2 , 22.4 , 24.7 , 28.9 mev , spanning the 4@xmath0 resonance in @xmath1be , for the integrated beam charges of 81 , 90 , 125 and 58 pnc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the data was analyzed to extract the events corresponding to the @xmath6-ray transition to the 2@xmath0-final state in @xmath1be and the subsequent 2-@xmath15 decay of the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the first condition imposed was the prompt concidence among the @xmath6-ray detector , at least one of the left rings and at least one of the right rings . </S>",
    "<S> this ensured a prompt coincidence also between the left and the right halves of the sisd . </S>",
    "<S> the sector timing was also demanded to be in prompt coincidence with the @xmath6-ray detector with two opposite sectors being simultaneously in coincidence . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions emphasized on the required events because the two @xmath15-particles from the decay of the final state are emitted at the azimuthal angles differing by @xmath4  180@xmath17 , neglecting the small momentum kick due to the transition @xmath6-ray . </S>",

    "<S> example of the time spectrum between the bgo detector array and the sisd at a beam energy of 22.4  mev showing the prompt time peak . </S>",
    "<S> the hit - multiplicities of the left and the right rings were constrained to one for each and the energy deposited in the left and right halves  ( e@xmath18 and e@xmath19 ) were constructed from the energy calibrations of the corresponding rings . for getting the @xmath6-ray energy e@xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the bgo detector with the highest @xmath6-ray energy was taken to be the primary detector . </S>",
    "<S> the energies deposited in the neighbouring detectors , which were also in prompt coincidence and contained the leaked shower energy , were added to that of the primary detector for each event . </S>",
    "<S> an event by event reconstruction of the total @xmath15-particle energy , e@xmath20e@xmath18  +  e@xmath19 was made with conditions of ( a ) both e@xmath18 and e@xmath19 being within a lower and a upper limit ( @xmath41@xmath513 mev ) and ( b ) the reconstructed total energy and the total momentum of the two @xmath15-particles being within a proper two dimensional gate . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions were guided by the monte carlo simulations described below .    </S>",

    "<S> a band of events around an e@xmath21 of 13  mev and e@xmath7 of 8  mev can be clearly identified . </S>",
    "<S> these events arise from the radiative capture of the two @xmath15-particles to the 2@xmath0 resonance in @xmath1be . a one dimensional spectrum of e@xmath22  =  e@xmath21  +  e@xmath7 is generated by putting one dimensional gates on e@xmath21 of 8.8@xmath515.0 mev and e@xmath7 of 3.4@xmath510.5  mev as suggested by simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> similar e@xmath22 spectra were generated at other beam energies by putting appropriate gates on these quantities . </S>",

    "<S> the peaks in the spectra ( not apparent at the highest beam energy which is beyond the extent of the 4@xmath0-resonance ) , corresponding to the @xmath6-ray transition between the resonances , were used in the calculation of the capture cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> the extraction of radiative capture cross sections requires a simulation of the experimental set up using a monte carlo code . </S>",
    "<S> such a simulation was done in two parts - one for the detection of the two @xmath15-particles and the other for the response of the bgo     = e@xmath18+e@xmath19 ( see text ) and e@xmath7 , generated with proper cuts as discussed in the text , at e@xmath23=22.4 mev . ]    </S>",

    "<S> the inefficiencies of the sisd due to gaps between rings and sectors were included . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-ray response was simulated using geant3  @xcite with the angular distribution from the aligned 4@xmath0 to the 2@xmath0 final state included . for each event , the @xmath6-ray energy was doppler corrected . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated event by event data was written in a file for analysis by the same program that was used to sort the actual data . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated data were sorted to create the e@xmath22 spectrum with the same conditions as used in the case of the actual data . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the n@xmath24 events corresponding to the 4@xmath0 to 2@xmath0 transition and the subsequent 2-@xmath15 decay , the counts n in the same peak regions as shown in fig.5 were calculated from the simulated spectra to get the overall detection efficiency ( n / n@xmath24 ) of the experimental set up . </S>",

    "<S> the effective @xmath15-particle energy @xmath25e@xmath26 at each beam energy was also extracted from the simulation after knowing the interaction region and the energy loss of the incident beam in the entrance window and in the target gas up to the interaction region . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath36 state shows a very subtle decrease over the same range , while the @xmath37 state drifts significantly lower ; the energies quoted below are obtained from a linear fit using the value at @xmath42 mev@xmath41 , with the monte carlo statistical error augmented by the range of values from @xmath43 mev@xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath35 should encompass the bulk of the improvement in the wave functions provided by the gfmc algorithm , before the tendency to dissolve into two @xmath15-particles sets in .    </S>",
