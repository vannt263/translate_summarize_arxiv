    "during the last decade , cobaltites have gained increased attention .",
    "a great effort is being made to clarify and systematize the extremely rich variety of phenomena they exhibit .",
    "initially , they were expected to show similar properties to other perovskite  family members , such as manganites and cuprates ,  @xcite but soon it was found that they present additional tunable features , as the cobalt spin state , that add to their complexity but also make them even more fascinating and challenging . among cobaltites , the layered compounds _ _ r__baco@xmath14o@xmath1 ( _ r _ being a rare earth ) are currently being intensively studied .",
    "@xcite the oxygen content in these compounds can be modified in a wide range ( @xmath15 depending on the _ r _ cation and the synthesis conditions ) ,  @xcite which in turn controls the mixed valence state of co ions .",
    "several factors strongly influence the physical properties of these cobaltites : the non  stoichiometry , the _ r _ cation size , the vacancies structural order , and  as we will show in the present work also the structural disorder introduced by doping the ba site with small quantities of smaller cations with the same valence state .    from a structural point of view , _",
    "r__baco@xmath14o@xmath1 is formed by a stacking sequence of [ coo@xmath0][bao][coo@xmath0][__r__o@xmath17 planes along the @xmath18axis ,  @xcite the usually called  112 \" structure derived form the @xmath19x@xmath19x@xmath20 cell , being @xmath19 the perovskite unit cell constant .",
    "the symmetry may be tetragonal or orthorhombic , depending on the oxygen content and the _ r _ cation .",
    "the oxygen vacancies have a strong tendency to become ordered , which results in several superstructures .",
    "@xcite    of particular interest is the case @xmath21 , for which co is expected to be completely in the + 3 valence state . in this case",
    ", a particular order of oxygen vacancies leads to the  122 \" superstructure , consisting of an ordered array of 50% co atoms in octahedral oxygen coordination and 50% in a pyramidal environment .",
    "this , in turn , favors a metal  insulator ( mi ) transition just above room temperature ( the @xmath22 depends again on the _ r _ cation ) which can be found only for @xmath23 values very close to 0.5 .",
    "@xcite when doping with holes ( co@xmath24 , @xmath25 ) these compounds behave as metals above the @xmath22 transition , but when doping with electrons ( co@xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , these do not seem to participate in charge transport , which has been explained in terms of a spin blockade .",
    "@xcite there has arisen a big controversy regarding the physical phenomena which occur at @xmath22 .",
    "regardless of the _ r _ cation , cobaltites with @xmath28 all show a jump in resistivity and a concomitant lattice distortion with a sudden volume collapse .",
    "the distortion is associated with specific changes in the co  o distances in pyramids and octahedra , and became the subject of different interpretations .",
    "a possible driving force for the mi transition has been proposed to be a spin state transition from the co low ",
    "spin state ( ls : @xmath29 ) to a high  spin state ( hs : @xmath30 ) occurring only at the octahedral sites .",
    "@xcite for the particular cases of _ r _  =  pr  @xcite and gd ,  @xcite this hypothesis would also be supported by a change in the slope of the inverse susceptibility curve at @xmath22 , which has been analyzed in terms of the curie  weiss model .",
    "further support to this scenario was given by maignan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for _ r _  =  ho based on thermoelectric measurements , showing that the spin blockade mechanism is fully compatible with this picture .",
    "other authors have proposed that a @xmath31 hybridization is enhanced in the metallic phase by the lattice distortion , such that the metallic or insulating behavior would be determined by the intersite mixing of the itinerant 3d electrons between the octahedral and pyramidal sites .",
    "@xcite for _ r _  =  tb the distortions of pyramids and octahedra were interpreted as a @xmath32 orbital ordering transition accompanied by a intermediate ",
    "spin ( is : @xmath33)to hs spin state transition .",
    "@xcite furthermore , pomjakushina _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that the observed volume collapse at the transition temperature and the existence of an isotopic effect are indicative of a charge delocalization breaking the orbital order of the insulating phase , which could be compatible with a spin state switch , but occurring in pyramids , not in octahedra .",
    "it seems obvious that this issue is far from being clarified and some effort must be made to systematize the study of the mi transition in cobaltites .    a second controversy , closely related to the one mentioned in the previous paragraph , concerns the low temperature ordering of the magnetic moments at the co sites .",
    "again , the feature which seems to be common to all _ r _ cobaltites is the existence of a spontaneous magnetization in a more or less narrow temperature range , depending on _ r _ , below room temperature . above this range",
    "they are paramagnetic , and below this range they transform to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state .",
    "it is now well established that the origin of the spontaneous magnetization is not a ferromagnetic order , but among the two remaining possibilities , _",
    "i.e. _ , a ferrimagnetic phase or a canted afm phase , there are various different models which have been proposed .",
    "some of these models involve a so  called spin state ordering ( sso ) in which not only the spin state may be different between co atoms located at pyramids and co atoms located at octahedra , but also among the pyramidal  @xcite or the octahedral sites  @xcite a sso may arise leading to a doubling of the @xmath34axis in the unit cell . indeed , a theoretical work by khomskii and lw  @xcite showed that such spin superstructures can be energetically favorable .",
    "these models would correspond to a ferrimagnetic phase . on the other hand , the proposers of canted ",
    "afm models argue that there are no structural evidences for the doubling of the @xmath34axis , and adopt the canted models which also explain the neutron diffraction data , with a doubling of the @xmath34axis just in the magnetic cell .",
    "@xcite however , some care must be taken when comparing all these experimental data .",
    "for instance , there may be no evidence of a  222 \" superstructure in cobaltites with _",
    "_  =  gd and pr  @xcite but the case might be different for other lanthanides .",
    "in fact , some studies using nmr techniques showed that for _ r _  =  y , there are four non  equivalent co sites at low temperature ,  @xcite and for _ r _  =  eu there are three ,  @xcite which is compatible with the sso scenario .",
    "it should be emphasized , too , that the  222 \" superstructure is very hard to detect from diffraction measurements unless an exceptionally high signal  to  noise ratio is attained . using transmission geometry , chernenkov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the superstructure can indeed be observed in single crystals with _",
    "_  =  gd using x  ray diffraction . in all cases",
    ", there seems to be consensus on the is character of pyramidal co atoms ,  @xcite although the spin state or spin states at octahedral sites remains uncertain or may , at least , depend on the _ r _ size .",
    "most studies of layered cobaltites were conducted for _ r _ among the lanthanides , but the compound with _ r",
    "_  =  y@xmath35 , which is a small , non  magnetic ion , is a good candidate to isolate the intrinsic properties of co and explore the small_r _ region of the phase diagram .",
    "it is now well documented , for instance , that the mi transition temperature decreases with the _ r _ size . to gain more insight into the possible role of disorder ,",
    "we have introduced a second source of distortion , by substituting the ba ",
    "site with ca , which has a smaller atomic radius .",
    "in addition , it has recently been postulated on the basis of density  functional theory calculations , that a smaller cation substitution in the ba  site of small lanthanide cobaltites could be a promising compound to exhibit enhanced giant magnetoresistance properties .",
    "@xcite the present work is aimed at characterizing and correlating the ba  substituted compounds when compared to the parent ybaco@xmath14o@xmath5 cobaltite .",
    "we have performed a structural characterization using neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) to study the interplay between the structures and their magnetic order , and correlate this information with our previous magnetic studies .",
    "three polycrystalline samples were prepared by solid  state reaction .",
    "high  purity powders of y@xmath14o@xmath36 , baco@xmath36 , caco@xmath36 and co@xmath36o@xmath37 were mixed at stoichiometric weights to prepare the compounds ybaco@xmath14o@xmath38 ( @xmath11 ) , yba@xmath3ca@xmath4co@xmath0o@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and yba@xmath7ca@xmath8co@xmath0o@xmath5 ( @xmath9 ) . after a de",
    " carbonation process at 1173  k for 18  h , the mixtures were pressed into pellets and annealed .",
    "the samples were annealed together during 25  h at 1273  k and slowly cooled at 1  k / min in oxygen flow . after a regrinding of the resulting pellets ,",
    "the compression and annealing at 1273  k in oxygen processes were repeated .",
    "a single batch was used for all the samples to guarantee identical synthesis conditions , which resulted in samples of about 1.5  g.    the oxygen content in our samples has been determined by refinement of our npd data .",
    "in addition , we have compared the macroscopic magnetization and resistivity of our @xmath11 sample with a very detailed study of the parent compound ybaco@xmath14o@xmath38 early reported by akahoshi and ueda  @xcite .",
    "their work presents the existing correlation between oxygen content and magnetic and transport properties .",
    "in particular , the magnetization curve for our sample ( fig .",
    "[ f : mdet ] ) reveals an excellent quantitative agreement with their results for @xmath21 , and a clear disagreement outside the range @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the resistivity measurements in our samples  @xcite show the characteristic sharp jump of the mi transition , which has been shown to occur only for @xmath40 but only to be sharp for @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "these limits give us confidence in the refined values from our ndp data .",
    "the global oxygen contents refined independently from 8 high resolution diffractograms , corresponding to different samples and temperatures always below 350  k were in mutual agreement within experimental error , yielding an average value of @xmath42 . in the following",
    "we shall refer to the samples using the notation y(ba , ca)co@xmath0o@xmath5 .",
    "neutron thermodiffraction data were collected on the high  intensity two  axis diffractometer d20 located at the high flux reactor of institute laue ",
    "langevin ill , grenoble , france .",
    "samples with @xmath43 and @xmath44 were cooled in a standard orange cryostat from room temperature down to 20  k , and diffraction patterns were then collected every two minutes at a warming rate of 1  k / min from 20  k to 320  k. a wavelength of @xmath45   was used to highlight the magnetic diffraction and was calibrated using a silicon sample .",
    "in addition , high  resolution npd data were collected at diffractometer super ",
    "d2b of ill for samples with @xmath46 and 0.10 .",
    "a wavelength of @xmath47   was used to collect patterns at selected temperatures for approximately 3  h. it is worth noting that the volume of sample available was not as much as the ideal for this kind of experiment , so we looked for a compromise between the collection time , the available beamtime , and our capabilities for preparing all the samples in a single batch .",
    "the npd patterns were processed with the full  pattern analysis rietveld method , using the program    fullprof    @xcite for refining the crystal and magnetic structures .",
    "the room temperature structures of the parent compound ybaco@xmath14o@xmath48 were first reported by akahoshi and ueda ,  @xcite who showed that for @xmath21 there may form two competing structures .",
    "one of them is orthorhombic , and corresponds to the space group @xmath49 having the  122 \" superstructure characteristic of similar cobaltites with @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite a schematic representation of this phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : estructura ] .",
    "the vacancies order consists of alternating [ coo@xmath50 octahedra chains along the @xmath18axis and corner  sharing [ coo@xmath51 pyramids along the @xmath52axis , resulting in alternating octahedral and pyramidal layers in the @xmath53 plane .",
    "this produces a doubling of the cell along the @xmath52axis , with a unit cell @xmath19x@xmath20x@xmath20 . the second structure that may stabilize in this system for @xmath21 ( and other values as well ) has a tetragonal symmetry and no doubling of the @xmath52axis , _",
    "i.e. _ , no ordering between pyramids and octahedra . in this case",
    ", the space group is @xmath54 and the unit cell @xmath19x@xmath19x@xmath20 .",
    "recently , frontera _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that , although the order of vacancies may not always be perfectly achieved , the order between the _ r_cation layer and the ba layer is well established and there is no mixing between them .",
    "neither are there significant oxygen vacancies in the [ bao ] layers . the  122 \"",
    "structure admits a certain degree of disorder , consisting of misplaced pyramids or octahedra , but keeping the long  range  122 \" order .    in the present refinements ,",
    "the ca cations were randomly introduced in the structure at the crystallographic site occupied by ba , in appropriate proportions .",
    "we have found no evidence of ca segregation nor the formation of additional phases , so we believe that ca has been successfully incorporated into the cobaltites structure .",
    "the strategy for the rietveld refinement was as follows .",
    "first , the high resolution data from d2b were refined to obtain an accurate nuclear structure for each sample . the raw data coming from the super ",
    "d2b detector were processed using the lamp software @xcite to obtain two sets of data : one of them having a better angle resolution at the expense of losing some neutron counts , the other one having all neutron counts collapsed into a single diffractogram .",
    "the first set was used to determine the lattice parameters , while the second set was used to refine the atomic positions and temperature factors , and both sets were iteratively refined until convergence to the structure .",
    "the magnetic structures were also included in the refinements .",
    "the models we have used will be discussed in the following sections . at a second step ,",
    "the structural data obtained were used to refine sequentially the neutron thermodiffractograms obtained at d20 .",
    "temperature scans where divided into different ranges according to the structural and magnetic order , and for each range the atomic positions and occupations obtained at d2b were kept fixed , while lattice parameters , temperature factors and magnetic moments were allowed to vary .",
    "the objective of this work is to focus on the role of ca addition to the parent compound ybaco@xmath14o@xmath5 .",
    "our results will show that there is a clear logical sequence between the three samples studied , corresponding to @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "surprisingly , the sample with greater ca content , @xmath9 , turned out to be the simplest one , and as ca is removed the complexity increases , resulting in a quite complicated temperature evolution of the parent compound .",
    "this fact probably explains why this compound has not yet been fully reported in such detail as other _",
    "r _ cobaltites , except for the structural study by akahoshi and ueda ,  @xcite and a recent neutron diffraction study by khalyavin _",
    "et al_.  @xcite focusing on the ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic transition . for the above reasons",
    ", we will present our results following the decreasing ca sequence .      in fig .",
    "[ f : d20-x ] we present two different sections of the projected thermodiffractograms for the sample @xmath9 .",
    "[ f : d20-x](a ) corresponds to the low  angle range , in which most reflections are of magnetic nature , and disappear simultaneously at @xmath55  k on warming from 20  k to 300  k. in fig .",
    "[ f : d20-x](b ) we focus on the @xmath56 range where the bragg reflections ( 2  0  0 ) and ( 0  4  0 ) clearly show a distortion occurring at room temperature .",
    "the high resolution data were refined using a nuclear phase with the  122 \" structure , as described in section  [ ss : structures ] .",
    "we do not discard the possibility of the actual structure being  222 \" , with a doubling of the @xmath34axis and four different crystallographic sites for the co atoms ,  @xcite in line with the magnetic model adopted .",
    "however , as we are interested in the temperature evolution of rather low resolution data from d20 , and given the complexity of the other samples , we have decided to refine the whole series with the averaged  122 \" structure .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite we have fixed the _ z _ coordinate of the octahedral co site to 1/4 , in order to obtain centrosymmetric octahedra . with these assumptions , we reduced the number of free parameters which is critical when dealing with multiphasic systems .",
