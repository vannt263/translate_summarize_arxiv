    "at a distance of @xmath8155 pc and with a canonical age of @xmath835 myr , ic  2391 is a ideal candidate to obtain an age based on the lithium depletion boundary ( ldb ) .",
    "this method is claimed to be less subject to possible systematic errors than those based on isochrone fitting to the upper main sequence ( ventura et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "see stauffer ( 1999 , these proceedings ) for more details about the ldb method .",
    "we have carried out several observing campaigns to identify new very low mass members , based primarily on their photometric properties , and to confirm membership and the location of the ldb , via spectroscopy .",
    "photometry : ( i ) `` big throughput camera '' at the 4m / ctio ( jan 1998 ) .",
    "we covered 2.5 sq .",
    "deg . in the @xmath9 filters , reaching a limiting @xmath5=23 , ( ii ) 0.9m / ctio @xmath10 @xmath11 filters ( april 1998 and jan 1999 ) , ( iii ) additional @xmath12 photometry from 2mass project ( adams 1998 , priv . com ) . in total",
    ", we identified 126 candidate members located in the cluster loci in all cm and cc diagrams .",
    "spectroscopy : ctio 4m / rc spectrograph , jan 1999 ( 6300 - 8820  , 2.7 resolution .",
    "we observed 19 ic  2391 candidate members , as well as several field m dwarfs for comparison purposes .",
    "additional details about the photometry and the selection of members can be found in barrado y navascus et al .",
    "the ldb age technique requires moderate s / n and spectral resolution . even for the closest and youngest clusters , the use of 4 m class telescopes ( or larger ) and long exposures times ( in the case of ic  2391 , up to 4 hours ) are necessary .",
    "therefore , it is vital to select the best membership candidates as targets for spectroscopic observations .",
    "this is achieved by using cm and cc diagrams ( see figure 1a , b ) .",
    "with spectra in hand ( some examples are shown in figure 2 ) , we used the following criteria to determine the cluster membership status of our candidates :    * radial velocities were compared with the cluster average of 15 km / s ( stauffer et al .",
    "( @xmath1)@xmath2 colors were derived by comparing the strength of several pseudo - continuum bands ( tio , vo and cah ) with the values of field stars .",
    "these colors were compared with the photometric values , assuming e(@xmath1)@xmath2=0.01 for ic  2391 .",
    "the same method was used to derive spectral types . *",
    "the gravity dependent nai8200   doublet ( strong in dm , weaker in pms m , and very weak in m giant stars , martn et al .",
    "1996 ) was used to eliminate background giants and nearby field stars .",
    "* h@xmath6 equivalent widths were compared with typical values for field stars and pleiades members ( see figure 3a ) .",
    "this graph indicates that most of our objects are chromospherically very active and , therefore , young .",
    "these criteria allowed us to reject two stars as members of the cluster , and classify another 2 as possible non - members .",
    "the other 15 objects are likely members of the ic  2391 cluster .",
    "the two faintest members are likely to be brown dwarfs , based on their photometry and theoretical models ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) .",
    "lithium was detected in one of the bona - fide members and was possibly detected in two other bona - fide members ( figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 3b shows a cm diagram for our candidates .",
    "we indicate those having lithium as well as those members without it . a zams and two isochrones of 30 and 50 myr",
    "are included for comparison ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 ) .",
    "we estimate that the location of the ldb is at @xmath5=16.2@xmath70.15 . using a distance modulus of @xmath13 and a@xmath14=0.02 yields m(@xmath0)@xmath15=10.23 .",
    "this implies a cluster age of 53@xmath75 myr , following figure 3 of stauffer et al .",
    "additional details on this result can be found in barrado y navascus , stauffer , & patten ( 1999 ) . while this value of the cluster s age is significantly larger than previous estimates ( @xmath835 myr ) , our result is consistent with recent age correction estimates of other young open clusters , such as the pleiades ( 125@xmath78 myr , stauffer et al .",
    "1998 ) and @xmath6 per ( 90@xmath710 myr , stauffer et al . 1999 ) , using the ldb method .",
    "the ldb ages for these latter two clusters are consistent with age estimates using upper main sequence isochrone fitting using models which assume a modest amount of convective core overshoot ( ventura et al .",
    "1998a , b ) . since the ratio age(standard)/age(ldb ) is almost constant for all these three clusters , it seems that the same moderate amount of overshooting is needed ( at least in the mass range of the turn - off of these clusters ) . the new age scale for young open clusters based on the ldb ages would have important consequences in a large variety of topics , including the empirical and theoretical correlations between lithium abundance , stellar activity , and rotation rate as a function of age for low mass stars .",
