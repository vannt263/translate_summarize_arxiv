    "the random field ising model ( rfim ) is among the simplest statistical mechanical models with quenched disorder but is still not well understood .",
    "it is presumed to describe equilibrium phase transitions in physical systems such as fluids adsorbed in porous media and diluted antiferromagnets .",
    "however , comparisons between theoretical predictions and experiments have been inconclusive because of the difficulty of equilibrating the experimental systems . for the three - dimensional rfim",
    ", it is known that there is an ordered phase for sufficiently low temperature and weak randomness  @xcite .",
    "the standard picture  @xcite is that the phase transition is continuous and is controlled by a zero temperature fixed point with three scaling exponents .",
    "the zero temperature ( strong disorder ) fixed point implies that controlled renormalization group calculations can not be carried out so that information about exponents has come from numerical simulations , series analysis  @xcite and real space  @xcite and other approximate renormalization group calculations  @xcite .",
    "there have also been suggestions that the transition is first - order  @xcite and , in fact , it is difficult to determine whether the magnetization vanishes continuously or discontinuously at the transition because the value of the magnetic exponent , @xmath3 is very small .",
    "monte carlo simulations  @xcite of the rfim suffer from long equilibration times and have been limited to small systems .",
    "the validity of obtaining critical exponents from small systems has been called into question by simulations  @xcite showing that for @xmath4 systems even qualitative features such as the apparent order of the transition vary from realization to realization .",
    "the difficulties of long equilibration times and small system sizes for monte carlo simulations have prompted a number of studies of the zero temperature rfim  @xcite .",
    "ground states of the rfim can be determined efficiently by mapping to the maximum flow problem and then using a polynomial time algorithm to solve the latter  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of these studies is that the zero temperature transition is in the same universality class as the transition at nonzero temperature . in this paper",
    "we consider the zero temperature rfim phase transition .",
    "estimates of many of the critical exponents for the three - dimensional rfim are converging but there is still a problem with the specific heat exponent , @xmath5 .",
    "monte carlo simulations  @xcite and some zero temperature studies  @xcite find @xmath5 to be quite negative , for example hartmann and young  @xcite find @xmath6 . on the other hand , a recent zero temperature study by middleton and fisher  @xcite concludes that @xmath5 is near zero .",
    "some experimental measurements of the specific heat  @xcite show no divergence and can be interpreted as @xmath5 near @xmath7 while other measurements",
    "@xcite yield @xmath5 near zero and the experimental picture remains controversial  @xcite .",
    "large negative values for @xmath5 are in disagreement with the modified hyperscaling relation , @xmath8 , that is a central feature of the zero temperature fixed point picture .",
    "the relatively well established results that @xmath9 is in the range @xmath10 and that @xmath11 is very close to @xmath12 imply that @xmath5 is not much less than zero .",
    "very negative values of @xmath5 are also inconsistent with the rushbrooke relation @xmath13 since @xmath14 is believed to be close to 2 .",
    "in this paper we study the zero temperature phase transition of the three - dimensional rfim with gaussian random fields .",
    "our two primary goals are to provide evidence that the transition is , indeed , continuous and to measure the specific heat exponent , @xmath5 .",
    "the novel feature of our approach is that for each realization of the normalized random fields we fine - tune both the strength of the random field and a uniform external field in order to bring the system to its finite - size `` critical point '' ( we refer to it as a critical point in anticipation of our result that the transition is continuous ) .",
    "machta , newman and chayes  @xcite implemented a similar idea in their monte carlo simulations .",
    "we identify the finite - size critical point as the point where three degenerate spin configurations have the largest jumps in the magnetization .",
    "critical exponents are extracted from the finite - size scaling of the discontinuities in the magnetization and energy at the finite - size critical point .",
    "our results support the view that the transition is continuous with @xmath5 and @xmath15 both near zero .",
    "the random field ising model considered here is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the coupling strength , @xmath1 is the strength of the random field , @xmath2 is the uniform external field , @xmath18 is the normalized random field at site @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the ising spin variable at site @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath21 indicates a sum over nearest neighbor pairs on a three dimensional cubic lattice of linear size @xmath22 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we take @xmath23 and the random fields to be gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit variance , @xmath24 the two quantities of primary quantities that we measure are the magetization , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the bond energy , @xmath27 , @xmath28    the presumed phase diagram of the three - dimensional rfim is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "the solid line is the phase transition between the ordered and disordered phases .",
    "the point @xmath29 is the critical point of the pure ising model while the zero temperature phase transition is at the point @xmath30 .",
    "assuming the absence of special points along the phase transition line ( e.g.  a tricritical point ) the universal properties along the entire phase transition line , except at @xmath31 , are expected to be the same as at the zero temperature transition .",
    "consider the zero temperature transition .",
    "if @xmath32 the system is in one of two ordered phases so the magnetization as a function of @xmath2 has a jump at @xmath33 while for @xmath34 , the magnetization is a continuous function of @xmath2 .",
    "if the transition is continuous , the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath35 is expected to vanish as a power law as @xmath1 approaches @xmath36 from below , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath15 is the magnetization exponent .",
    "figure [ ord]a illustrates the continuous transition scenario in the zero temperature @xmath2-@xmath1 plane with a critical point at the end of a line of first - order transitions .",
    "another possibility is that the zero temperature transition is first - order .",
    "a possible scenario is illustrated with fig .",
    "[ ord]b . here",
    "@xmath39 is a point of coexistence of two ordered phases and one disordered phase .",
    "the magnetization of the coexisting ordered phases is nonzero while the disordered phase has zero magnetization .",
    "there will also be a nonzero  latent heat \" at the transition .",
    "although entropy is ill - defined at zero temperature , it is reasonable to define latent heat in terms of a discontinuity in the bond energy , @xmath27 , between the ordered and disordered phases .",
    "the foregoing applies to infinite systems .",
    "the ground states of a typical finite system for a given realization of the random field are shown in fig .",
    "[ coegdet ] .",
    "each point in the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane corresponds to a single ground state of the system .",
    "the set of points corresponding to a single ground state form a polygon since , for a given spin configuration , the energy is linear in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in principle , there might be several degenerate ground states in a nonzero area of the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane but , for a continuous distribution of random fields , the probability of exact degeneracy vanishes except along lines and at points . along the edges between polygons the two ground states corresponding to each polygon are degenerate .",
    "three ground states are degenerate at `` triple points '' where three edges meet . in principle , more than three ground states can be degenerate at a point but , for a continuous distribution of random fields , the probability of more than three degenerate ground states vanishes .    degenerate ground states typically differ on a small fraction of spins but , corresponding to the first - order line of the infinite system , some degenerate ground states differ by a large fraction of the total number of spins .",
    "the bold lines in fig .",
    "[ coegdet ] correspond to large jumps in the magnetization . for @xmath32 , there is a single jump between ground states with large positive and negative magnetization and the separation between these `` phases '' is the piecewise linear curve @xmath40 .",
    "this coexistence line is close to but not coincident with the @xmath1 axis .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath35 is the magnetization of the positively magnetized ground states along @xmath41 .",
    "as @xmath36 is approached from below , @xmath35 decreases in steps at triple points .",
    "since the net change in magnetization around a triple point is zero , the decrease in magnetization along @xmath41 is exactly the jump across the third edge or `` lateral line '' that defines the triple point .",
    "as the critical point is approached , the magnetization drops more precipitously so that the magnetization jump across the lateral line increases .",
    "we identify the finite - size `` critical point '' as the triple point with the largest jump across the lateral line . in fig .",
    "[ coegdet ] the finite - size critical point is shown as an open circle and the corresponding lateral line is also shown as thick line .",
    "the three states that are degenerate at the critical point are called the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 states according to their relative magnetizations . if the transition were first - order these states would be the zero temperature analog of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ordered phases and the disordered phase that coexist at a thermal first - order transition .",
    "one way to measure the discontinuity in the magnetization at the critical point is via the quantity , @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the magnetizations of the three coexisting critical ground states .",
    "note that the same combination of three magnetizations is small at triple points away from the critical point , even along the first - order line .",
    "although the energy , @xmath50 , is a continuous function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , the bond energy , @xmath27 , has discontinuities across edges separating coexisting ground states .",
    "the bond energy along the coexistence line , @xmath40 , is expected to increase monotonically as @xmath1 increases with jumps across each lateral line .",
    "the largest discontinuity in the bond energy is expected at the finite - size critical point and the quantity @xmath51 , is a measure of that discontinuity , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the bond energies of the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 states , respectively .    if the phase transition is continuous , both @xmath45 and @xmath51 must approach zero as the system size goes to infinity while if the transition is first - order , these quantities will saturate at nonzero values .",
    "furthermore , if the transition is continuous , we propose the following finite - size scaling behavior for the disorder averages of these quantities , @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath22 is the linear size of the system , @xmath5 is the specific heat exponent , @xmath15 is the magnetization exponent and @xmath9 is the correlation length critical exponent .",
    "the finite - size scaling hypothesis for the magnetization is essentially identical to the standard finite - size scaling hypothesis except that the measurement is made at a point that is fine - tuned for the given realization of disorder rather than at the infinite system size critical point .",
    "the finite - size scaling for the bond energy energy is more difficult to motivate .",
    "first , at zero temperature free energy and energy are identical and entropy and specific heat are not well - defined .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the derivatives of energy with respect to @xmath17 at zero temperature have the same singularities as the derivatives of the free energy with respect to temperature at nonzero temperature .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) , bond energy plays the role of entropy and its derivative with respect to @xmath17 plays the role of specific heat .",
    "the conventional finite - size scaling hypothesis for the specific heat is @xmath58 if the specific heat is integrated across the finite - size rounding region defined by @xmath59 we obtain the finite - size `` latent heat '' , @xmath60 of the transition , @xmath61 at zero temperature , this latent heat is replaced by the discontinuity in the the bond energy . furthermore , since the bond energy changes at a discrete set of discontinuities , we propose that a finite fraction of the latent heat is concentrated at the triple point with the largest discontinuity , i.e.  the point we have identified as the finite - size critical point . since @xmath51 measures the square of the latent heat at the finite - size critical point , we obtain eq.([eq : fsse ] ) .",
    "the main goal of our simulations is to find and measure the properties of the zero temperature , finite - size critical point .",
    "the finite - size critical point is defined as the triple point with the largest jump in the magnetization between all three coexisting states . to find it we carry out an iterative search using a method similar to the one described in ref .",
    "first , a point in the ordered phase on the first - order line is located .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ coegdet ] we locate ground states `` a '' and `` b '' and a point on the coexistence line between them .",
    "next , the first - order line is followed in the direction of increasing @xmath1 from one triple point to the next . in the example of fig .",
    "[ coegdet ] the triple point where `` a '' , `` b ' ' and `` + '' are degenerate is located first . at each triple point , the continuation of the first - order line ( in this example , between `` a '' and `` + '' ) and the lateral line ( between `` b '' and `` + '' ) are identified according to the relative sizes of the discontinuities in the magnetization across the lines . the sequence of triple points is recorded and the triple point with the largest discontinuity in the magnetization across the lateral line is identified as the finite - size critical point .",
    "the most difficult computational problem in carrying out this program is to find the ground state for given values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath62 .",
    "finding ground states can be reduced to the problem of finding the maximum flow on a graph @xcite for which there exists polynomial time algorithms .",
    "we use the push - relabel network flow algorithm @xcite , implemented in @xcite as version hi_pr , to find ground states .",
    "let s now describe in detail the two subroutines of the search algorithm .",
    "subroutine 1 finds a point on the first - order line separating the positively and negatively ordered phases .",
    "two ground states are found deep in the ordered phases at values @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "once these ground states are found , the algorithm calculates the value of @xmath2 where these two states are degenerate along the @xmath65 line .",
    "this point of degeneracy is easily found by the solution of two simultaneous linear equations since once @xmath50 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 are known for a given spin configuration at some point in the @xmath66 plane , the value of @xmath50 for that spin configuration at any other point is linearly related . at this point of degeneracy",
    "the ground state is calculated .",
    "if the result is either of the two original ground states then we have found a point on the first - order line .",
    "if the ground state at the point of degeneracy is not one of the original states then a new point of degeneracy is found between this new state and one of the original two states .",
    "the choice of which original state to pick is made by the criterion that the jump in the magnetization between it and the new state is biggest .",
    "this process is repeated until the first - order line is found .",
    "subroutine 2 follows the first - order line found in subroutine 1 until the first triple point is found in the direction of increasing @xmath1 . from the point found by subroutine 1 on the first - order line a new point",
    "is picked by moving in the direction of the first - order line and increasing @xmath1 by @xmath67 . on fig .",
    "[ coegdet ] this new point is on an imagined continuation of the thick line between `` a '' and `` b '' in the direction of @xmath42 .",
    "an increase of @xmath67 in @xmath1 has proved to be sufficiently large to extend to a new ground state for all system sizes studied .",
    "subroutine 2 is similar to subroutine 1 except that original ground states are always retained in the iteration and a sequence of new ground states with decreasing values of @xmath1 are generated . at each step in the iteration",
    ", the point of degeneracy is found between the new and the old states and the ground state is computed at that point .",
    "if the ground state is one of already identified states then the triple point has been found otherwise the iteration is repeat . call this first triple point @xmath68 .",
    "the triple point @xmath68 defines three lines of coexistence , one of these lines is the previously identified first - order line .",
    "the jumps in magnetization across the other two lines are measured .",
    "the line with the smaller jump in magnetization is called the `` lateral line '' and the remaining line with the large jump in magnetization is continuation of the first - order line . the jump across the lateral line",
    "is recorded and subroutine 2 is invoked again to find the next triple point along the first - order line . by repeating this set of steps many times , a sequence of triple points @xmath69 are identified . the triple point with the largest jump across the lateral line",
    "is identified as the finite - size critical point , @xmath70 .",
    "we note that while the critical point is identified by the size of the jumps in the magnetization , in every case that we examined it also has the largest discontinuity in the bond energy . in principle",
    ", a definition of the finite - size critical point based on the bond energy discontinuity might sometimes yield a different triple point .    a typical running time for finding the ground state for a system of @xmath71 is @xmath72 sec / spin on a pentium iii 750mhz machine .",
    "the total running time of the entire algorithm for the same system size is approximately one minute .",

    "the number of realizations of disorder range from 23 to 126 for different system sizes .",
