    "thus these paths only have horizontal steps with a @xmath101 step at the end , or they only have horizontal steps with the exception of one @xmath99 step , either above a @xmath1 label or following an @xmath100 step along a @xmath2 label .",
    "recall that @xmath220 the first term is @xmath221 corresponding to the horizontal path with @xmath101 appended to the end .",
    "since @xmath67 is a derivation , we apply the product rule to @xmath222 to get @xmath223 if @xmath224 , we have @xmath225 corresponding to the paths where the @xmath99 step is above a @xmath1 label .",
    "the weight of this step has coefficient  @xmath153 since it is along the top half of a @xmath2 label on the vertical axis . on the other hand , if @xmath226 , we have @xmath227 corresponding to the paths with @xmath228 steps above the @xmath2 label , where the coefficient of the weight of the @xmath99 step is again @xmath153 by the same reasoning",
    ". therefore , @xmath229 gives the correct paths that combine with the initial @xmath99 step to make up the paths @xmath70 , proving equation  .",
    "if @xmath92 is broken up at a @xmath2 , we assume @xmath206 , and we have that @xmath92 splits as @xmath207 .",
    "this gives two terms , the first being @xmath230 the @xmath2 is the correct weight of the first @xmath99 step in @xmath70 since it can not be followed by a @xmath101 step .",
    "otherwise , the path would be invalid since it would have @xmath106 or @xmath158 as a subword .",
    "@xmath231 gives the weights of the remainders of the paths @xmath70 due to an argument analogous to the one used in the previous subcase , because treating the second half of the @xmath2 label on the horizontal axis as a @xmath1 label does not change any of the weights of these paths .",
    "illustrations of the lattice paths in equation   and the following equation can be found in figure  [ proof_example4 ] .",
    "the second term from this situation is @xmath232 here , we are assuming the degree of @xmath132 is @xmath133 ; hence , the degree of @xmath205 is @xmath233 .",
    "note that the path @xmath210 does not have its weight changed as it becomes the path @xmath7 when the @xmath1 label is switched to become the first half of a @xmath2 label .",
    "this is true since the only possible difference could be the coefficient of a  @xmath99 step above the final @xmath1 label .",
    "however , this coefficient will not change since it must be followed by a  @xmath101 or @xmath152 step if the @xmath99 step is not the final step in @xmath210 , or it is followed by a @xmath99 step if it is the final step in @xmath210 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath153 is correct for the @xmath99 step between the paths @xmath7 and @xmath70 since it is above the second part of a @xmath2 label . although it is not possible to partition the labels in order to have the correct weights when writing @xmath7 and @xmath70 as elements of @xmath234 for some @xmath0-monomials @xmath235  and  @xmath236 as was done in the previous cases , it is still clear that the contribution that @xmath70 makes to the weight is @xmath219 , similarly to the last two subcases .",
    "the lattice paths in @xmath237 must either end in a @xmath152 step , or by rule 1 , there must be two @xmath99 steps to the right of the last @xmath2 label of @xmath215 with horizontal paths between and after these steps .",
    "the three types of terms from the coproduct consist of all ways for these @xmath99 steps to occur , with the three types being distinguished by whether the first @xmath99 step is above a @xmath1 label , the first part of a @xmath2 label , or the second part of a @xmath2 label .",
    "therefore , @xmath237 decomposes as the disjoint union @xmath238where the set   is from equation  ,   from  ,   from  , and   from  .",
    "this decomposition gives us the proof for the case of @xmath93 ending in a @xmath2 , concluding the proof of the theorem .",
    "the effect on the @xmath0-index of a second important operation on posets was studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this operation is the cartesian product of posets , defined at the beginning of section 3 .",
    "as the diamond product of posets is related to the cartesian product of polytopes , the cartesian product of posets is connected to the _ free join _ of polytopes , defined as follows . if @xmath44 is an @xmath76-dimensional polytope and @xmath78 is an @xmath77-dimensional polytope , then embed @xmath44 and @xmath78 in @xmath239 by @xmath240 and likewise by @xmath241 then the free join @xmath242 is the @xmath243-dimensional polytope defined as the convex hull of  @xmath244  and  @xmath245 .",
    "kalai @xcite observed that the face lattice of the free join of two polytopes is the cartesian product of the two face lattices , i.e. , for two polytopes @xmath44 and @xmath78 we have @xmath246 .",
    "ehrenborg and readdy @xcite developed a bilinear operator from @xmath247 to @xmath53 , called the mixing operator  @xmath248 , in order to study the @xmath0-index of the cartesian product of posets , or likewise the @xmath0-index of the free join of polytopes . as with the diamond product operator , section 6 of @xcite and section  10 of",
    "@xcite give the definition and recurrences for this operator .",
    "the recurrence is nearly identical to that of the diamond product ; however , differing initial conditions cause the degree of @xmath249 to be one higher than the degree of @xmath91 .",
    "is there a similar lattice path interpretation for this product ?",
    "even a good interpretation for the easier cases of @xmath250 or the cartesian product of @xmath6-monomials is currently unknown .",
    "recently carl lee ( personal communication ) found an equation that relates the free join and cartesian product of polytopes , while also involving the pyramid and prism operations .",
    "together with ehrenborg , the author used a chain counting argument to show it is true for @xmath0-indices of the analogous operations on posets .",
    "it states that for two posets @xmath7 and @xmath70 , we have @xmath251 if one could develop lattice path interpretations for the three simpler terms on the right hand side , it would allow us to have an interpretation for the cartesian product @xmath252 .    a different approach to studying how flag @xmath3-vectors change during poset operations such as the cartesian product and diamond product is by using quasi - symmetric functions .",
    "the quasi - symmetric function of a poset is multiplicative with respect to cartesian product ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  4.4 ) .",
    "similarly , the type @xmath253 quasi - symmetric function of a poset is multiplicative with respect to the diamond product ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  13.3 ) .",
    "could this approach be helpful in gaining a better understanding of these product operators ?",
