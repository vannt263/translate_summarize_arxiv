    "the topology of superconducting thin films has a strong impact on the shape of the superconductor - normalconductor phase boundary in an external magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "basically the reason for this connection is the fluxoid quantization condition , requiring that along each closed path inside the superconductor the gauge invariant phase is an integer multiple of @xmath5 .",
    "as pointed out first by little and parks @xcite this quantization condition leads to an oscillation of the transition temperature @xmath2 of a superconducting cylinder in a magnetic field . in a field parallel to the cylinder symmetry axis ,",
    "the periodicity of the @xmath6-oscillations is one flux quantum @xmath7tm@xmath8 per cross sectional area of the cylinder .",
    "these little - parks oscillations were also found in two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconducting wire networks with periodic or quasiperiodic structure @xcite , where the flux quantization has not only to be fulfilled for each single loop of the network but also for all paths around multiple loops . in these samples ,",
    "commensurable states between the applied flux and the network are also observable at fractional ( periodic networks ) or even irrational ( quasiperiodic networks ) multiples of one flux quantum per single loop .",
    "another famous consequence of the fluxoid quantization is the formation of abrikosov vortices , when a type - ii superconducting thin film is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field . in an ideal type - ii superconductor , these vortices with",
    "normal conducting cores are repulsively interacting and form a highly ordered state , the hexagonal abrikosov vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "as the formation of a normal conducting core costs condensation energy , any defect in a real superconductor , where the superconducting phase is weakened , can be viewed as an energy minimum for an abrikosov vortex .",
    "for the case of an ensemble of vortices interacting with an ensemble of defects , the repulsive interaction of the vortices plays an important role and the resulting spatial vortex configuration is determined by an interplay of the energy gain due to vortex pinning at defects and the energy cost due to the elastic vortex lattice deformation . with modern lithography techniques it is possible to create lattices of artificial pinning sites , _",
    "e.g. _ , antidots @xcite , magnetic dots @xcite or carbon nanotubes @xcite with almost arbitrary topology , on the characteristic length scales of the superconductor ( penetration depth @xmath9 and coherence length @xmath10 ) .",
    "such pinning potential landscapes can be varied in terms of size , geometry and amplitude during the patterning process .",
    "in addition , the strength and range of the vortex - vortex as well as the vortex - defect interaction can be tuned during the measurements by varying the sample temperature @xmath4 and hence @xmath9 and @xmath10 . finally , it is possible to easily control the vortex density via the applied magnetic field and to create constant and alternating forces on the vortices by applying external currents .",
    "hence , abrikosov vortices in a micropatterned superconducting film constitute a highly designable model system for interacting particles in a 2d potential . in such systems , dynamic effects like phase locking phenomena @xcite and ratchet effects @xcite have been intensely investigated , as well as static effects like the formation of vortex quasicrystals @xcite in particular for artificial defects arranged in a penrose pattern . an experimentally easily accessible quantity to gather integral information on the static interaction between a vortex lattice and a pinning array is the magnetic field dependent critical depinning current @xmath11 , where _ e.g. _ commensurabilities between pinning sites and vortex lattices can be seen as pronounced maxima @xcite .",
    "the implementation of artificial defects as pinning sites for abrikosov vortices has furthermore relevance for a variety of applications , as in many cases the dissipative vortex motion leads to a reduction or a limitation of the performance of superconducting devices and hence is desired to be suppressed by pinning sites .",
    "approaches for improving the performance of superconducting microelectronic devices have found strategically positioned antidots feasible for the reduction of low - frequency flux noise in quantum interference devices @xcite and for the reduction of vortex associated losses in coplanar microwave resonators @xcite .",
    "quasiperiodic arrays might be particularly suitable for some of these applications , as they have many built - in periodicities , which moreover are not only found for integer or rational but also for irrational multiples of the matching field , _ i.e. _ the field for which the vortex density @xmath12 equals the density of pinning sites @xmath13 . for the penrose tiling for instance ,",
    "this leads to a significant broadening of the @xmath11 peaks , as compared to the triangular defect lattice @xcite and hence to a more homogeneous @xmath11 dependence . in this work ,",
    "we experimentally investigate the @xmath3 phase boundary of superconducting niobium thin films with three different arrangements of antidots  two kinds of quasiperiodic arrays , namely the shield tiling ( st ) @xcite and the tuebingen triangle tiling ( ttt ) @xcite  and for reference a triangular lattice .",
    "we perform our measurements close to @xmath2 , where little - parks oscillations and collective abrikosov vortex pinning are not strictly separable effects .",
    "there might also be a smooth transition with decreasing @xmath4 from the wire network limit to a film with holes @xcite .",
    "however , we are not going to focus on such a possible transition in this paper , but rather investigate commensurable states between an ensemble of quantized fluxoids and a given microtopology .",
    "hence , we monitor the phase boundary holistically . we find and discuss signatures for commensurabilities at nonmatching excess flux densities , which have been predicted by theory @xcite and which might be attributed to a caging effect and the formation of giant vortices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we also discuss experimental results on a sample with a hexagonal antidot array for reference .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusion of this work .",
    "the experiments were carried out on cross - shaped structures patterned in @xmath14 nm thick dc magnetron sputtered nb films .",

    "[ fig : figure1 ] ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) . a more detailed description and discussion of the quasiperiodic tilings is given together with the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the antidots of the samples shown here and used for the presented experimental results have a diameter @xmath27 nm . for a rough estimate of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath9 and the coherence length @xmath10 in our samples , we determined the resistance slightly above @xmath2 as @xmath28 ( cf . sec .",

    "so for further calculations we use the corrected resistivity @xmath33 cm . using @xmath34cm@xmath8 @xcite we determine the electron mean free path @xmath36 nm . as we have neglected the antidots in this calculation , the value for @xmath37 is probably somewhat over - estimated and as a consequence the value for @xmath38 is somewhat under - estimated . with the bcs coherence length for niobium of @xmath39 nm and the  dirty limit ",

    "analogously , with the london penetration depth @xmath43 nm at @xmath44 and @xmath45 we find @xmath46nm@xmath42 . as for all our data @xmath47 and",
    "hence @xmath48nm@xmath49 nm , we have to consider the thin film penetration depth @xmath50 .",
    "again , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are somewhat under- and over - estimated , respectively .",
    "the samples were mounted in a low - temperature setup with high temperature variability @xmath53k@xmath54k and stability @xmath55mk @xcite .",
    "we record current - voltage characteristics ( ivcs ) over the whole 2d phase space of perpendicular magnetic field between the critical fields @xmath56 and temperatures close to the transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we keep the stepwidth between different temperatures @xmath57 and different values of magnetic field @xmath58 constant ; so for each value of @xmath4 we have ivcs for all values of @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "this procedure enables us to extract all information as @xmath11 , @xmath6 or @xmath59-curves for arbitrary and freely selectable voltage criteria @xmath60 , resistance criteria @xmath61 and bias currents @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2 ] shows for a sample with a triangular antidot array ( a ) the critical current @xmath62 and ( b ) the resistance @xmath63 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] ( a ) , we can extract single vertical and horizontal slices , which correspond to @xmath11-curves ( dark lines ) for constant @xmath4 and to @xmath6-curves ( bright lines ) for constant @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "similarly , from fig .  [ fig : figure2 ] ( b ) we get @xmath59-curves for constant @xmath4 ( dark lines ) and @xmath6-curves for constant @xmath24 ( bright lines ) by taking vertical and horizontal slices , respectively .",
    "the cross shape of our nb structures is expected to induce an inhomogeneous current density distribution across the center area .",
    "this point has been particularly discussed for a ratchet experiment @xcite , where the direction of the local driving force relative to the intrinsic symmetry axes of the pinning lattice is of great importance .",
    "also in periodic and quasiperiodic potential landscapes with circular antidots , the vortex dynamics might depend on the direction of the local transport current density @xcite .",
    "however , we do not find our experimental results to differ significantly for the two possible perpendicular directions of the bias current .",
    "it is most likely anyway that the depinning current density is first reached directly between the voltage pad contact points , where the mean current density reaches its maximum due to the smallest cross section area .",
    "so we think that the essential results of this work are not influenced by the bridge geometry . due to the used voltage amplifier",
    ", we had to face a voltage noise of several @xmath64v . to improve the signal to noise ratio and the visibility of small matching features ,",
    "the results presented in this paper are not single - shot raw data but have been averaged and smoothed for their final interpretation and presentation .",
    "first , we measured five ivcs at each @xmath65 phase space point , each consisting of @xmath66 data points , and averaged them for the further processing .",
    "the averaged ivcs were slightly smoothed by a non weighted five - point adjacent - averaging before we extracted voltages for pre - defined currents or vice versa . at the end",
    "we once more performed a non weighted three - point adjacent - averaging on the resulting @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath59 slices .",
    "before we discuss our results on quasiperiodic antidot arrays , we present the results on the sample with the triangular lattice . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] already reveal clear and strong features , which indicate commensurabilities between the flux line and antidot density .",
    "we find pronounced and narrow ridges in ( a ) and canyons in ( b ) at @xmath67 ( corresponding to one vortex per antidot ) .",
    "we find quite similar but somewhat weaker structures for flux densities corresponding to two and three vortices per antidot ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "our findings show that our samples and our data analysis are suitable to reliably detect not only strong commensurability features at integer matching fields , but also weaker ones at fractional matching flux densities .",
    "these weaker commensurabilities at fractionals of the matching flux reveal themselves by characteristic fine - modulations of the phase boundary at flux densities between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3 ] ( a ) shows several @xmath11-slices . marked with arrows between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , there are four small sub - peaks visible , which we attribute to the fractional filling factors @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "corresponding vortex configurations and in addition the one for @xmath67 are depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ( b ) . the observed fractional matching peaks for @xmath76 and the corresponding vortex configurations",
    "have been found in theoretical as well as some experimental studies on triangular pinning lattices before , cf . _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we find very similar peaks for flux densities between @xmath67 and @xmath77,_i.e .",
    "_ for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , indicating that the same configurations are stable for two - vortex occupations , that is when all antidots are already occupied by one vortex .",
    "the shield tiling [ cf .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ]  ( c ) ] consists of three different tiles : a square , an equilateral triangle and a deformed hexagon with alternating interior angles of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this is a very interesting collection of tiles , as two of them locally resemble the energetically most favorable configurations of a periodic abrikosov vortex lattice : the triangular and square array .",
    "each hexagon as the third basic shape leaves a rather large antidot - free area , what  regarding the whole lattice  leads to quasiperiodically distributed , individual cages or reservoirs for interstitial vortices as also described in ref .",
    "the pattern was created by starting with six hexagonally arranged triangles followed by an iterative application of inflation rules @xcite . in a previous theoretical study on different quasiperiodic pinning arrays",
    ", we have found that the critical current density of a superconductor with antidots arranged in the shield tiling shows two pronounced @xmath11 maxima .",
    "one of them corresponded to the first matching field @xmath67 .",
    "the second maximum was found for an excess flux density of @xmath84 . according to simulations",
    ", this corresponds to the situation , where all antidots are occupied by one vortex , and within each hexagon there is an additional interstitial vortex @xcite .",
    "these interstitial vortices are caged , _",
    "i.e. _ pinned by the repulsive interaction with the surrounding vortices , which are pinned at antidots . in the sample investigated here , we expect the additional maximum at @xmath85 , which is at a slightly lower value than in ref .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the maximum is expected at @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the total number of hexagons and antidots , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath89 converges for large numbers of antidots . in the numerical approach in ref .",
    "@xcite we have only used @xmath90 pinning sites with @xmath91 . in our experimentally used array with @xmath92 antidots",
    "we have @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] ( a ) shows @xmath11-curves of the shield tiling sample at several different temperatures . at first sight , there seems to be no additional maximum around @xmath94 but only a very strong and single maximum of the critical current at @xmath67 .",
    "however , when we cool the sample to lower temperatures a double - peak structure appears with one peak at @xmath77 and one at a slightly higher field value @xmath95 .",
    "this additional peak  or more precisely speaking its height relative to the one at @xmath77  has a strong dependence on temperature .",
    "it is almost absent at @xmath96k but then grows and becomes the dominating peak at @xmath97k ( and probably below ) .",
    "a very similar relation and development between two peaks with temperature has been reported for caged vortices in periodic pinning arrays before @xcite and might be attributed to an increasing interaction strength between the vortices due to a decreasing penetration depth .",
    "the predicted matching at an excess vortex density peak seems to appear not at @xmath94 but at @xmath98 .",
    "it is thus very likely that singly occupied antidots are still too attractive for vortices entering above @xmath67 , hence , they first occupy the antidots twice before the centers of the hexagons become energetically more favorable .",
    "we show sketches of the proposed vortex configurations in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure4 ] ( b ) . of course , the situation depicted here is somewhat idealized . in simulations we find similar situations , but we also find a certain degree of disorder in the vortex lattice in any case .",
    "for example , for @xmath77 it might well be that not all six antidots of the hexagons are doubly occupied .",
    "it is rather likely that one or two of them only host one vortex , while there are also interstitials present .",
    "the simulations we refer to here , are not shown , as they were not performed exactly with the experimental parameters . however , they served as an inspiration for the proposed vortex configurations . the discussed observations of commensurabilities in the shield tiling are closely related to widely discussed caging effects in different kinds of periodic pinning arrays , including randomly or periodically diluted triangular lattices @xcite .",
    "these studies have revealed , that matching peaks can be shifted to higher field values than those , for which vortex and antidot density are equal .",
    "whenever there are areas with missing antidots , these areas fill up with interstitials , when the antidots are saturated and these configurations with interstitials can be more stable than the configurations without interstitials .",
    "the second quasiperiodic arrangement  the tuebingen triangle tiling  is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ( d ) .",
    "it consists of two different isosceles triangles , one acute - angled and one obtuse angled .",
    "this tiling can also be constructed by an iterative application of inflation rules @xcite after a starting configuration of ten acute - angled triangles .",
    "in contrast to the triangular and the shield tiling , the edge lengths are not equal for all basic shapes here , but we find two different lengths , whose ratio is the golden mean @xmath99 .",
    "this can lead to a locally reduced pinning site density , when ten triangles are composed such that 10 antidots form a ring , for example in the left upper and lower corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ( d ) .",
    "below , these full rings with 10 antidots surrounding one as a circle are called 10/10-circles .",
    "the 10/10-circles have a high antidot line density on the circle and a reduced density in the interior and may again be viewed as cages or reservoirs for interstitial vortices .",
    "in contrast to the cages in the shield tiling we here find the situation that there actually is one antidot in the center of each 10/10-circle .",
    "analogously to the shield tiling discussion we have to calculate the ratio of the number of 10/10-circles @xmath100 over the total number of antidots @xmath88 in order to assign the appearance of local maxima in @xmath11 to vortex configurations related to the circles .",
    "this ratio is found to be @xmath101 for @xmath102 , as after each iteration the total number of antidots increases by a factor of @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath104 for the @xmath105th iteration .",
    "after three iterations each antidot has transformed into a 10/10-circle , _ i.e. _ @xmath106 . the next step is to investigate the phase boundary of the ttt sample with respect to modulations associated with @xmath107 .    , ( c ) @xmath108 , ( d ) @xmath109 and ( e ) @xmath110 including higher order giant vortices . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : figure5 ] ( a ) shows @xmath11-curves of the tuebingen triangle tiling sample at five different temperatures .",
    "there are two strong sub - peaks for flux densities @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "similarly to the triangular lattice this substructure for ( probably irrational ) fractionals of @xmath71 repeats itself with a somewhat smaller amplitude between @xmath67 and @xmath113 .",
    "also in our previous numerical simulations we have found this characteristic double - peak structure at approximately the same values as in the present experimental study @xcite . however , we have not found a simple connection between these peaks and intuitively understandable vortex configurations .",
    "regarding the first matching field , there seems to be just the standard single maximum for @xmath67 at first sight . but a zoom - in as in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ( b ) indicates a double peak structure , where the two peaks are merged into a broad one with two kinks at @xmath67 and at a slightly higher value ( marked by arrow ) . the vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ( b ) indicates the position of @xmath114 and matches very well the flux density value of the second kink .",
    "the second peak hence can be attributed to the flux value , where we have one vortex per antidot and one additional vortex per 10/10-circle in the sample .",
    "one possibility is that the additional vortex is at an interstitial position somewhere inside the circle or that the additional vortex pushes the vortex out of the center antidot , so that the two of them symmetrically occupy the circle interior as interstitials .",
    "however , we favour a third possibility .",
    "the idea is connected to a recent imaging experiment of vortices in a quasiperiodic penrose pinning lattice @xcite , which revealed a symmetry - induced formation of giant vortices . in the tuebingen triangle",
    "tiling situation we think that the antidot in the center of the 10/10-circles is occupied by a double - vortex at @xmath114 , while all other pinning sites are occupied by one vortex .",
    "this double - vortex is supposed to compensate the magnetic pressure from the surrounding vortices on the ten vortices pinned at the circle line .",
    "it stabilizes the whole configuration this way .",
    "exactly this vortex configuration with ten vortices forming a circle and one double - vortex in its center was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for pinning sites arranged in the penrose tiling .",
    "it is remarkable that in the penrose pattern the pinning site circle is not even complete , but has three pinning site free positions .",
    "the fact that the giant vortex configuration forms anyway , strongly indicates its energetic favorability .",
    "this should be even more favorable in the tuebingen triangle tiling .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure6 ] ( a ) depicts the tuebingen triangle tiling and possible vortex configurations corresponding to @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] ( b ) ) and @xmath114 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "similarly to the phase boundary of the shield tiling , we also find interesting features in @xmath11 of the tuebingen triangle tiling sample around @xmath77 , cf .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ( c ) .",
    "we note the surprising absence of a maximum at @xmath77 . nevertheless we find a clear double peak structure similar to the one around the first matching field .",
    "the first of the two peaks is approximately at a value @xmath115 ( dashed vertical line ) and the second at a somewhat higher value , but not exactly at @xmath116 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the interpretation of the first peak in terms of vortex configurations is obvious .",
    "here we have the situation that all antidots are occupied by two vortices , whereas those antidots in the center of a 10/10-circle are occupied by three vortices , cf .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] ( d ) .",
    "the absence of the @xmath113 peak indicates that a third vortex in the center antidot might be necessary to stabilize the configuration .",
    "in contrast to the situation around @xmath67 , it is likely that some vortices from the circle lines sit in the interior as interstitials rather than being pinned at an antidot .",
    "we think this situation is similar to that in the shield tiling , where the caging peak gets stronger than the @xmath113 peak with decreasing temperature .",
    "analogous to the peak at @xmath114 we should find a maximum for the situation when the antidots in the 10/10-circle center are occupied by twice the number of vortices as the surrounding pinning sites , _",
    "i.e. _ by a quadruple - vortex .",
    "but this seems not to be the case , as the second kink of the double peak is found at a higher value than @xmath116 ( dotted vertical line ) .",
    "we believe , that in this second peak another structure in the tuebingen triangle tiling comes into play , which we call the 9/10-circle .",
    "this structure is almost identical to the 10/10-circle but with one of the ten circle antidots sitting at a closer position to the one in the center . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] ( a ) three 9/10-circles are visible .",
    "they are always directly neighboring a 10/10-circle forming an 8-like structure .",
    "one possibility to get a stable vortex configuration is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] ( e ) , where the center antidots of the 10/10-circles are occupied by quadruple - vortices , the center antidots of the 9/10-circles are occupied by triple - vortices and all other by a double - vortex .",
    "unfortunately we can not give an analytical expression for the corresponding flux density value , as we were not able to determine the ratio of the number of 9/10-circles over the total number of antidots .",
    "probably one has to consider more complicated configurations including interstitial vortices and also present 8/10-circles to find the true vortex configurations .",
    "furthermore , there seem to be some more small shoulders and peaks above @xmath113 , which we can not unambiguously attribute to simple vortex configurations .",
    "we finally consider selected horizontal phase boundary @xmath6 slices of the three samples .",
    "we define @xmath2 by a fixed ratio @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the normal state resistance slightly above the superconducting transition at @xmath70 and @xmath61 is a resistance value within the transition regime .",
    "vs temperature @xmath4 close to the transition temperature @xmath2 of the three investigated samples ; ( b)-(d ) transition temperature @xmath2 vs normalized magnetic flux density @xmath119 for four different resistance criteria ( from top to bottom in each graph @xmath120 ) of the three investigated samples ; @xmath118 was determined at @xmath121k . ]",
    "the transition temperatures of the three samples are comparable , cf .",
    "[ fig : figure7 ] ( a ) .",
    "however , the absolute values as well as their ratios depend on the resistance criterion . for instance",
    ", the sample with the triangular antidot lattice shows a clear two - step ( or even three - step ) transition @xmath122 for an unknown reason and depending on the criterion has a smaller _ or _ larger critical temperature than the st sample .",
    "also , the general shape of the transition ( e.g. the curvature of the curve at @xmath123 ) slightly varies from sample to sample and all transitions show smaller or larger steps .",
    "fingerprints of these stepwise transitions can also be found in the @xmath6 curves , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure7 ] ( b)-(d ) .",
    "concerning our discussion of excess flux stabilities , the most important observation in the @xmath6 data is that these commensurabilities for the shield and the tuebingen triangle tiling , which we have already found in the @xmath11 patterns , are also clearly visible in @xmath6 .",
    "all commensurability features are rather weak for the highest resistance criterion @xmath124 , but get stronger and more pronounced with decreasing @xmath61 .",
    "one exception with yet unclear origin has been observed for the shield tiling , where the first matching peak seems to get weaker again for the lowest criterion @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath61 is decreased further ( and with it the temperature ) , this peak gets stronger again , cf .",
    "also @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] , where the temperatures are lower than in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure7 ] ( c ) .",
    "this behaviour of the first st matching peak strength might be connected to the transition from a superconducting wire network to a thin film with holes , but the observed variations and steps in the transition as well as the nature of the problem confront us with several complications for a detailed interpretation and quantitative analysis . due to a not well - defined transition temperature , we can not reliably calculate the values for the characterictic length scales such as penetration depth @xmath126 and coherence length @xmath51 , which diverge at @xmath2 and hence are strongly dependent on the measurement temperature as well as on the transition temperature .",
    "it is thus not possible to reliably calculate , at which temperature the coherence length @xmath51 is comparable to the width @xmath127 of the superconducting material in between the holes , _ i.e. _ at which temperature the transition from a superconducting wire network ( @xmath128 ) to a film with holes ( @xmath129 ) takes place . for the case of a quasiperiodic arrangement of antidots ,",
    "this transition is not even well - defined , as @xmath127 is spatially varying .",
    "nevertheless , for having an idea of the relevant numbers , we can calculate the approximate temperature below @xmath2 , at which the distance between the holes is comparable to the coherence length .",
    "assuming @xmath130k and @xmath131 nm we find with the expressions from sec .",
    "[ sec : fabrication ] that @xmath132 nm if @xmath133k . in other words , as long as we are farther away from @xmath2 than @xmath134mk the samples can be viewed as superconducting films with holes rather than as wire networks .",
    "although the numbers here are only rough estimates , all @xmath11 curves above can be considered to have been taken at temperatures well below @xmath2 and so the observations correspond to abrikosov vortex physics . however , due to the differences in the shape of the @xmath122 transition and the absolute values of @xmath2 we can not compare the performance of different pinning lattices concerning critical currents , neither at absolute values of @xmath4 nor at reduced values @xmath135 .",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally investigated the @xmath3 phase boundary of niobium thin films with quasiperiodic microtopology .",
    "we have done this by means of transport characterization measurements and discussed the results with the focus on observed commensurability effects for flux densities larger than the matching flux .",
    "our experiments confirm some theoretically predicted and yet experimentally unobserved excess flux matching effects for antidots arranged corresponding to the shield tiling and to the tuebingen triangle tiling . for the shield tiling , we attribute this excess flux matching to an effective caging of abrikosov vortices in quasiperiodically distributed antidot - free hexagons .",
    "we find similar excess flux commensurability features for antidots arranged in the tuebingen triangle tiling .",
    "however , apart from the possibility of caging , the results can be understood as a consequence of recently reported symmetry - induced formation of higher order giant vortices .",
    "in particular , we find in both cases that the additional vortices , which create the excess flux commensurabilities , are needed to maximize the local stability of the vortex lattice . to finally confirm our interpretations of the matching effects and to decide which vortex configurations are correct",
    ", one needs to carry out imaging experiments such as magneto - optical imaging , bitter decoration or hall probe microscopy .",
