    "of course , a time - evolved macroscopic vorticity field @xmath15 is obtained by solving the macroscopic euler equation ( [ eqn : macroeuler ] ) .",
    "is the space - averaged point vortex solution @xmath16 the same as the macroscopic vorticity field @xmath17 ? if the number of point vortices @xmath18 , the answer is `` yes '' because there is no fluctuation about the mean field @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for finite @xmath0 systems , the answer is `` no '' because there are fluctuations implying a deviation to the macroscopic euler equation . in that case",
    ", the evolving equation for @xmath19 which is exactly equal to @xmath20 should be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a collision term . in the following ,",
    "we restrict our discussion to determining an explicit formula of @xmath22 , i.e. , we develop a kinetic theory of point vortices .    the kinetic theory of point vortices has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "let us briefly review earlier works on the subject .",
    "a general kinetic equation for point vortices , valid for arbitrary flows ( axisymmetric or not ) , has been obtained by chavanis @xcite with several equivalent methods ( projection operator technics , the bbgky hierarchy , and the klimontovich approach ) .",
    "it writes @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a green function constructed with the mean velocity , @xmath25 is the velocity created by point vortex @xmath26 on point vortex @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the fluctuating velocity , and @xmath29 is the circulation of a point vortex .",
    "this equation is valid at the order @xmath30 when @xmath31 , so it describes the evolution of the system of point vortices , due to two - body distant encounters , on a time scale of the order @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dynamical time . for axisymmetric flows ,",
    "the point vortices have a circular motion with angular velocity @xmath34 . in that case , the collision term can be simplified and the kinetic equation ( [ gen7 ] ) takes the form @xcite : @xmath35 this equation conserves circulation , energy , angular momentum , and it increases monotonically the boltzmann entropy ( @xmath1 theorem )",
    ". the collisional evolution of the point vortices is due to a condition of resonance encapsulated in the @xmath36-function .",
    "we note that when the profile of angular velocity is , or becomes , monotonic , the condition of resonance can not be satisfied anymore and the collision term vanishes . as a result",
    ", the evolution described by the kinetic equation ( [ sd4 ] ) stops even if the attained distribution differs from the boltzmann distribution ( this is because the kinetic equation ( [ sd4 ] ) admits an infinity of steady states in addition to the boltzmann distribution , namely any distribution with a monotonic profile of angular velocity ) .",
    "therefore , the kinetic equation ( [ sd4 ] ) usually does _ not _ converge towards the boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem .",
    "it simply tells us that , for axisymmetric flows , the relaxation towards the boltzmann distribution is governed by another kinetic equation , valid at the order @xmath37 ( or at a higher order ) , taking into account more complicated correlations between point vortices than simply two - body collisions . as a result ,",
    "the relaxation time towards the boltzmann distribution is of order @xmath38 or longer @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the point vortex gas ( in the axisymmetric situation ) never achieves the boltzmann distribution .",
    "this is still an open problem . for non - axisymmetric flows",
    ", a natural strategy would be to introduce angle - action variables to obtain a generalization of the kinetic equation ( [ sd4 ] ) similarly to what has been done in the context of the landau and lenard - balescu equations in stellar dynamics @xcite .",
    "alternatively , chavanis @xcite has proposed a heuristic simplification of the kinetic equation ( [ gen7 ] ) in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "this equation conserves circulation , energy , angular momentum , and it increases monotonically the boltzmann entropy ( @xmath1 theorem ) .",
    "furthermore , for axisymmetric flows , it reduces to a form very close to the exact eq .",
    "( [ sd4 ] ) up to logarithmic corrections . as in eq .",
    "( [ sd4 ] ) , the collisional evolution of the point vortices according to eq .",
    "( [ grd ] ) is due to a condition of resonance encapsulated in the @xmath36-function .",
    "however , this condition of resonance is more complicated ( hence more easily satisfied ) than in eq .",
    "( [ sd4 ] ) so we may expect that the solution of this equation reaches , or approaches , the boltzmann distribution on the time scale @xmath32 over which this equation is valid . indeed , there are numerical observations that , for non - axisymmetric flows , the relaxation time is of order @xmath32 @xcite . therefore , if there are enough resonances , the kinetic equation ( [ grd ] ) will drive the system towards the boltzmann distribution on a time scale @xmath32 while if the resonances can not be satisfied the kinetic equation ( [ grd ] ) is not sufficient to describe the dynamics ( we have to take terms of order @xmath37 , or higher , into account ) and the relaxation time will be of order @xmath44 , or longer @xcite . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the kinetic equations ( [ gen7])-([grd ] ) have the form of fokker - planck equations @xmath45 including a diffusion term and a drift term ( they exactly reduce to fokker - planck equations in the test particle approach ) .",
    "the drift term was first evidenced in ref . @xcite and it plays a fundamental role in the kinetic theory of point vortices in relation to the process of self - organization .",
    "finally , these kinetic equations can be easily generalized to the multi - species point vortex gas as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the previous kinetic theories @xcite , the mean field",
    "is assumed to be `` strong '' and the fluctuations `` weak '' so that the point vortices are advected by the mean velocity for a long time .",
    "for example , in an axisymmetric flow , the point vortices follow circular trajectories in a first approximation slightly perturbed by the effect of the long - range collisions ( whose strength is of order @xmath46 ) on a very long time scale . in that case , the dynamics of the point vortices is  resonant \" ( see the @xmath36-function in eqs .",
    "( [ sd4 ] ) and ( [ grd ] ) ) .",
    "the opposite situation is when there is no mean flow .",
    "this is the situation investigated by taylor and mcnamara @xcite and dawson and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they consider a neutral system of point vortices at equilibrium where the vortices are uniformly distributed in average . in that case , there is no kinetic equation for @xmath47 since @xmath48 at each time @xmath49 ( however , there can be large - scale fluctuations giving rise to dawson vortices ) .",
    "taylor and mcnamara @xcite consider the diffusion of a test vortex in a uniform vorticity background where the field vortices can be correlated ( having a thermal distribution ) or uncorrelated ( having a random distribution ) and derive the corresponding diffusion coefficient . in that case , there is no drift since the vorticity is uniform . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a situation intermediate between the works of refs . @xcite and the works of refs .",
    "we assume that the mean field is weak , but non - zero , so the time scale of the macroscopic motion is long as compared to the decorrelation time . in this case",
    ", we can make a linear trajectory approximation with the local velocity field @xmath7 to compute the correlation function .",
    "in our problem , the distribution of the point vortices is spatially inhomogeneous and out of equilibrium , so our aim is to determine a kinetic equation that describes the relaxation of @xmath47 towards the boltzmann distribution . since the mean flow is weak , the kinetic evolution will not be `` resonant '' so it should be described by a kinetic equation different from eqs .",
    "( [ sd4 ] ) and ( [ grd ] ) .",
    "this approach is not in contradiction with previous works .",
    "it just explores a completely different regime , so it should be considered as being complementary to previous works @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec_val ] , we try to justify the domain of validity of this approach by estimating the decorrelation time and the time scale of the macroscopic motion .",
    "it is shown that there is a critical value of @xmath50 .",
    "the case of @xmath51 corresponds to the situation of the current paper and the case of @xmath52 corresponds to the previous studies .",
    "however , we make clear since the start that the present approach is not firmly justified mathematically ( in a well - defined asymptotic limit ) and this is the reason of the problems encountered , and discussed , at the end of the paper . despite these limitations ,",
    "the linear trajectory approximation is interesting in itself because it makes the kinetic theory very similar to that developed in plasma physics and stellar dynamics where the particles have linear trajectories due to their inertia .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see what a similar approximation implies in the case of point vortices .",
    "furthermore , it leads to explicit kinetic equations that could be confronted to direct numerical simulations .",
    "actually , this linear trajectory approximation was introduced in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite where the kinetic equation ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) was derived directly from eq .",
    "( [ gen7 ] ) . for self - consistency , this equation is re - derived here from the start by using the klimontovich formalism .",
    "then , we introduce a space average of the diffusion flux and derive the kinetic equation ( [ finea ] ) .",
    "the obtained collision term has the following good properties .",
    "( i ) it conserves the mean field energy .",
    "( ii ) during the relaxation process towards the global equilibrium , the system first reaches a local equilibrium state . in the local equilibrium state ,",
    "the relation @xmath53 $ ] is satisfied in each small region inside which the inverse temperature @xmath54 is constant ( notation @xmath55 $ ] is a functional of the stream function @xmath56 ) . in the small regions ,",
    "the second term @xmath57 of the euler equation ( [ eqn : macro - with - collision ] ) vanishes .",
    "then the time evolution of the system is dominated by the collision term . however , the magnitude of the collision term is small compared to that of @xmath57 , and the speed of the relaxation slows down .",
    "when the system reaches a global equilibrium state described by the boltzmann distribution @xmath58 , the collision term completely converges to zero all over the system and the einstein relation is obtained @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the obtained collision term satisfies the @xmath1 theorem which guarantees that the system relaxes to a global equilibrium state .",
    "as the order of the collision term is @xmath30 , the relaxation time scales as @xmath0 .    in order to illustrate our theoretical study ,",
    "we have performed direct numerical simulations of point vortices to confirm the scaling of the relaxation time .",
    "the results elucidate a new scaling according to which the relaxation time @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "the previously obtained scaling @xmath61 by kawahara and nakanishi @xcite where @xmath33 is the dynamical time of the system is also reexamined and confirmed .    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the point vortex system and the klimontovich formalism are briefly introduced . in sec .",
    "iii , we demonstrate explicit formulae for the diffusion and the drift terms as intermediate results . in sec .",
    "iv , a detailed calculation of the diffusion term is shown .",
    "since similar calculations can be applied to the drift term , the details for the drift term are omitted . in sec .",
    "v , three good properties of the collision term are demonstrated . in sec .",
    "vi , we mention the limitation of our approach . finally , in sec .",
    "vii , we compare our results with direct numerical simulations of point vortices . we find a good qualitative agreement .",
    "consider a 2d system consisting of @xmath0 positive point vortices @xcite .",
    "the circulation of each point vortex is given by a positive constant @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64-component of the microscopic vorticity on the @xmath65 plane , and @xmath66 is the dirac delta function in two dimensions .",
    "the microscopic variables in the microscopic equation are identified by @xmath67 . for brevity",
    ", we shall omit the @xmath49 and @xmath68 dependences if there is no ambiguity .",
    "vector @xmath69 is the position vector of the @xmath26-th point vortex .",
    "the discretized vorticity ( [ eqn : point - vortex ] ) is a formal solution of the microscopic euler equation ( [ eqn : euler ] ) .",
    "other microscopic variables are defined by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the velocity field and the stream function in the 2d plane , @xmath73 is the unit vector in the @xmath64-direction , and @xmath74 is the 2d green function for the laplacian operator in an infinite domain . since the solution of a macroscopic fluid equation should be given by a smooth function , the singular solution ( [ eqn : point - vortex ] ) should be regarded not as a solution of the macroscopic equation but as one of the microscopic equation .",
    "thus we call the equation that has the microscopic point vortex solution ( [ eqn : point - vortex ] ) , the  microscopic \" euler equation .",
    "there exist many analogies between point vortices , plasmas , and stellar systems ( despite , of course , some important differences ) , and similar methods can be developed to study these systems @xcite . in plasma physics and stellar dynamics ,",
    "the evolution of the macroscopic phase space density @xmath75 is governed by the vlasov - landau kinetic equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the mean force by unit of mass acting on a particle , and @xmath81 is a constant ( @xmath82 for stellar systems and @xmath83 for plasmas where @xmath84 is the coulombian logarithm ) .",
    "this equation can be derived from the klimontovich equation for the microscopic phase space density @xmath85 that is @xmath86 by using a quasilinear approximation @xcite .",
    "the vlasov - landau equation has the form of a fokker - planck equation @xmath87 including a diffusion term and a friction ( it exactly reduces to a fokker - planck equation in the test particle approach ) .",
    "as the dynamics of plasmas and stellar systems is usually dominated not by collisions but by a collective behavior due to long - range interactions , the collision term can often be neglected ( on a collisionless time scale or for @xmath31 ) and it yields the simplest form of the kinetic equation called the vlasov equation : @xmath88    the same hierarchy exists in the 2d fluid equations @xcite . the most microscopic equation is the microscopic euler equation ( [ eqn : euler ] ) , which has the discrete particle solution ( [ eqn : point - vortex ] ) .",
    "this is the counterpart of the klimontovich equation ( [ klim ] ) in plasma physics and stellar dynamics . dividing the microscopic variables into a macroscopic and a fluctuation part , and taking ensemble average yields a macroscopic fluid equation with a collisional effect like the kinetic equations ( [ gen7])-([grd ] ) derived in the past or like the kinetic equation ( [ finea ] ) derived in this paper .",
    "these kinetic equations are analogous to the vlasov - landau equation ( [ exp5 ] ) .",
    "they have a fokker - planck form in which the drift of the point vortices is the counterpart of the dynamical friction [ compare eqs .",
    "( [ fp ] ) and ( [ fpbi ] ) ] , as noted in ref . @xcite .",
    "ignoring the collision term in the above macroscopic equations , we obtain the inviscid fluid equation , namely the macroscopic euler equation ( [ eqn : macroeuler ] ) .",
