    "there is an emerging picture of the universe obtained from the tremendous progress achieved by precision cosmology . according to this picture we live in a weird universe . a universe which",
    ", at present redshifts , @xmath0 , and energy scales @xmath1 , is : dominated by a mysterious component of energy , coined dark energy , driving it into an accelerated expansion @xcite;and which , contrary to our theoretical expectations based on the inflationary paradigm , has large angle cmb perturbations suppressed @xcite .",
    "the later puzzle is not confirmed yet due to limitations from cosmic variance @xcite , and the need for a better understanding of the systematic and foreground effects .",
    "hence a lot of work done in investigating this effect @xcite , by using complementary data to minimize statistical errors , points out that the suppression of cmb power for large angles @xmath2 persists .",
    "in what follows , we take the wmap cmb measurements @xcite at large scales as true and consider the power suppression at low multipoles @xmath3 to be a real physical effect rather than a statistical fluke .    dark energy domination and cmb power suppression of perturbations at large angles ,",
    "both occur , around the same redshift and energy scale @xmath4 ev .",
    "they both raise two disturbing questions : why is their magnitude so small , ( the tuning problem ) , and , why are they occurring now , ( the coincidences problem ) .",
    "a consistent theoretical model should simultaneously address both questions , the tuning and the cosmic coincidences , for these observed phenomena . besides",
    ", it should also address why both coincidences occur at the _ same _ energy scale , our present hubble radius @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that too many coincidences in the present universe may indicate the emergence of a new scale in physics of the order our hubble scale @xmath4 ev .",
    "no such model exists yet . perhaps because an understanding of the underlying fundamental theory is required in order to explain the current challenges that theoretical cosmology is facing . as",
    "yet string theory is the leading candidate for new physics although it has still not provided us with satisfactory answers to the above issues .",
    "a conservative approach would be to question whether we need new physics at all for addressing the current problems .",
    "distinct observational signatures would be the best way for resolving these doubts and for providing direct evidence of new physics if it exists .",
    "therefore , it is of crucial importance to attempt to distinguish whether what is giving rise to the observed cosmic coincidences are features of inflaton @xcite or imprints of new physics @xcite .",
    "this question is the scope of our work here , namely : can we uniquely identify and discriminate new physics signatures from inflaton features in the presently available observables in the sky ?    a positive answer to the above question in favor of new physics , possibly string theory as its leading candidate , would provide the first direct evidence for its existence .",
    "this is a difficult task to investigate .",
    "any signatures expected from new physics , e.g. anomalies on the cmb spectra , are very small@xcite .",
    "furthermore , even if they are within the detection limits , it is notoriously difficult to identify whether it is some feature of the unknown inflaton potential@xcite that give rise to the anomalies or whether the anomalies are rooted in new ( string ) physics . besides",
    ", the origin of dark energy and its relation to the power suppression of low multipoles around redshift @xmath6 is not yet understood .",
    "in this situation , we need to identify an imprint which arises uniquely from one type of theory but is generically negligible in the other .",
    "we demonstrate in the next section that finding such a unique handle on the observational signatures is possible and then use this handle to discriminate among various models with respect to their imprints on the combined data from cmb spectra , lss and dark energy .",
    "the autocorrelation spectra do not yield any new information on the origin of the observed anomalies since they are sourced by the same term @xcite .    in the standard theory of inflation and physics of the early universe ,",
    "the temperature perturbations given by the sachs - wolfe effect are    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the gravitational background potential and @xmath9 are the physical comoving distance and redshift respectively .",
    "the index @xmath10 denotes the value at last scattering surface .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath8 is related to the growth factor of structure @xmath11 through @xmath12.denoting the three dimensional matter power spectrum by @xmath13 then the power spectrum for the cmb temperature anisotropies in a flat universe is    @xmath14 ^ 2 \\,\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of @xmath16 .",
    "an expression similar to eqn .",
    "[ temp2 ] gives the spectrum of the curl free e - mode of polarization of cmb photons , denoted by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "but the same gravitational potential @xmath8 that produces the temperature anisotropies @xmath18 also sources the polarization spectra namely the @xmath19 -modes and gravitational lensing of lss .",
    "in fact gravitational lensing can be a powerful tool for mapping the background potential for lss .",
    "the projected spectrum is described by the following potential    @xmath20    and the angular power spectrum of the lensing potential is    @xmath21 ^ 2 \\,\\ ] ]    where similarly @xmath22 is the fourier transform of @xmath23 .",
    "notice however that although both spectra depend on the same source in the conventional theory , their integral dependence on @xmath8 , in the expressions ( [ temp1 ] ) and ( [ lens ] ) are sufficiently different .",
    "this fact can be exploited by using the cross correlation spectrum between @xmath24 in identifying disreptancies with the expectations of the standard concordance cosmology .",
    "@xmath25 \\,\\ ] ]    a similar expression to eqn .",
    "( [ crossshear ] ) gives the cross - correlation spectrum @xmath26 of t with e - mode .",
    "the role of dark energy on the low multipoles @xmath3 is to enhance their power through the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "the observed suppression of power may indicate that clustering properties at large scales are different from the predictions of the standard theory and such that they compete with the isw effect .",
    "the correlations reveal whether either of the two spectra deviate , due to new physics , from the standard dependence on @xmath27 expected by the equations above .",
    "deviations may arise from contributions from noninflationary channels or a fundamental string scale imprinted on @xmath28 that may signal a breakdown of the conventional theory .",
    "below we use the combination of both correlation spectra @xmath26 and @xmath29 as our handle in identifying the origin of the imprints on observations while avoiding some of the degeneracies among cosmic parameters .",
    "generically , the inflaton field , ( in single - field inflation models ) , is very weakly coupled to other sectors due to the slow roll conditions and adiabaticity requirement .",
    "meanwhile there is no reason why the coupling of the stringy moduli fields to the matter sector should be suppressed .",
    "therefore any features on the inflaton potential and their signature to lss and clustering properties at large scales would be very different from the effects from variations of moduli couplings carried over to the matter sector .",
    "these moduli couplings could have a large impact onto the clustering properties of large scale structure and the polarization spectrum .",
    "for this reason discrepancies in the cross correlations would reveal complimentary information in identifying the origin of the observed signatures .",
    "in sect.2 we provide the theoretical framework for a generic classification of the possible effects of string and brane - world models on the low - energy universe . there",
    "we describe how cross - correlation spectra provide the extra information needed in order to discriminate between a standard inflationary model with a feature on its potential , from the various string - inspired classes of cosmology beyond the concordance model .",
    "we focus only on the string models from literature that can give rise to an accelerated expansion of the universe at late time , a criteria imposed by observations , which takes account of the isw effect .",
    "data analysis of @xmath30 spectra for the string effects in cosmology such as variations of the string coupling constants , dispersion relation for the matter fields arising from their coupling to moduli fields , changes in the strength of gravity , large scale clustering properties and variations of the background gravitational potential @xmath31 due to the higher dimensional nature of gravity , is presented in sect.3 .",
    "there we show how the @xmath26 spectrum breaks some of the degeneracy of the cosmological parameters while the @xmath29 spectrum carries the unique signature for new physics .",
    "results obtained in sect.3 . are discussed in sect.4 .",
    "suppose we were to focus solely on the origin of cmb power suppression at large angles @xmath2 , and the cosmic coincidence this suppression introduces to cosmology , while putting aside the fine - tuning and coincidence puzzles associated with dark energy .    in this case , a bump on the inflaton potential which can violate the slow roll conditions can be as good of a candidate for giving rise to the observed cmb power suppresion@xcite as any of the more exotic possibilities associated with string theory and brane worlds .    nevertheless , a feature on the inflaton potential can not address why this suppression occurs only for such specific low l values , that is , only for perturbations modes with wavelength of the order our present hubble radius @xmath32 .",
    "for example for gut scale inflation a feature has to be introduced in an @xmath33 manner in its potential around the 60th e - folding in order to suppress the power of present low l multipoles .",
    "we will not try to address the issue of the cmb cosmic coincidence@xcite here since the answer may be rooted at a deeper level to an interplay with the dark energy coincidence occurring at the same time and energy scale .",
    "however the combination of the two problems , as discussed in @xcite , may be a good hint already that a new and fundamental theory may be at works for these puzzling observations in the late time universe .",
    "the double cosmic coincidence provides our motivation for trying to discriminate inflationary signatures versus new physics imprints from observations , specifically with respect to the origin of the observed cmb large scale power suppression.coupling to the matter sector is our handle for discriminating among the two groups of models : conventional and , new physics .",
    "the inflaton is very weakly coupled to the matter sector by the constraints of the slow roll and adiabaticity .",
    "any features in its potential around the 60th efolding , @xmath34 , while they may suppress power of temperature autocorrelations @xmath18 at low l , they predict an identical behavior for all other spectra since the source term for seeding all spectra is the same@xcite and can be calculated . thus their predictable impact on deviations from the conventional large scale structure ( lss ) and the clustering properties of matter at very large scale can be scrutinized .",
    "predictions of single - field inflaton models with a feature are already in disagreement with the data , fig.[1 - 4 ] , ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile there is no physical reason to expect that some of the couplings of various moduli fields , predicted generically by string theory , to the matter sector are highly suppressed.these coupling can for example give rise to a modified friedman equation either on the geometry or the energy density side , in higher dimensional worlds and/or provide new noninflationary sources for lss .",
    "generically the coupling constants are functions of the @xmath35 of moduli fields @xmath36 and for this reason they can vary in space and time@xcite .",
    "therefore any slight or long - range variations in the string coupling constants to the matter sector or gravity , while suppressing the autocorrelation functions @xmath18 could also have a considerable impact on lss and clustering properties at present horizon size scales .",
    "but @xmath29 and @xmath26 correlations compare the sources that give rise to @xmath37 spectra and the lensing potential of lss thereby unravelling any discrepancies with inflationary physics.in short , unlike the single field inflation , it is natural for string theoretical models of cosmology to provide more degrees of freedom and more than one source for seeding lss and @xmath38 spectra .",
    "we do not make use of the b - mode spectrum since measurement of the b - mode may not become available in a near future , although this spectrum , when available , can provide an independent handle for discriminating models through the consistency relation of the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes @xmath39 and cross - correlations with the @xmath40-modes .",
    "let us treat these cases one by one below .",
    "our analysis is carried out with the data already available and the one expected in a near future from weak lensing measurements for large scales .",
    "these models were studied in @xcite by introducing a step in the inflaton potential @xmath41 @xmath42 \\ , \\ ] ]    this potential has a step at @xmath43 with size and gradient controlled by the two parameters @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the step can be chosen to correspond to @xmath34 .",
    "it was shown in@xcite that besides departure from scale invariance and an oscillatory behaviour of the cmb spectrum this feature can produce significant effects at large scales . thus using the observational input one can in principle constrain the parameters @xmath45 such that this model comes in agreement with cmb at all scales , including the suppression of power at low l.    the extreme case of the potential step function is to take a complete cuttoff at @xmath46 thereby limiting the inflationary window to no more than 60 efoldings .",
    "this case is treated in @xcite and the authors showed explicitly how this model can suppress quadropole power completely , and be in perfect agreement with the wmap observations for @xmath18 .",
    "however , the analysis of the cross - correlations spectra @xmath47 were not investigated for either model until now . as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1,2,4 ] in sect.3 , all the auto and cross - correlation spectra for the class of inflationary models with a feature ( dashed line graph ) exhibit the same behaviour in the low l regime since they are sourced by the same term and thus highly correlated @xcite .",
    "the fact that all spectra and lss are seeded by the same source , namely the primordial power spectrum , is a prediction of inflation .",
    "therefore the modifications in spectra are overconstrained and do not allow any possibilities to simultaneously fit all data by e.g.simply introducing features on inflaton potentials .",
    "this means that if a feature on inflaton potential suppresses @xmath18 at large scales than it will automatically imposed the same suppression on @xmath48 at large l.      there are many phenomenological models in literature for this class .",
    "since we would like to make some generic and preferably model independent analysis and predictions , it is useful to try and classify them in as a general way as possible . for consistency , the first criteria to this purpose is to consider only models that may accommodate the observed late time acceleration of the universe thereby including the isw effect on large scale spectra .",
    "we proceed in the classification in the following manner : first we classify them by the time when string corrections to conventional physics become significant ; then independent of the time of deviation , we catalogue these models by all the possible imprints they can leave on the low energy observables .    *",

    "weak lensing for large scales becomes an important direction for precision cosmology as it may provide further important evidence for new physics .",
    "it is interesting that the scale for late - time modification of gravity needs to be much larger than what is found in the dgp model .",
    "this model in its original form is clearly ruled out by present cosmological data .",
    "however the need for @xmath179 seems to be true in general for class * b.2 * of sec.2 and , can be interpreted as evidence for the emergence of a second scale in physics , which is not mediated by inflation .",
    "it should be noted that none of the popular stringy models we analyzed here , fig[1 - 7 ] , are a perfect match to data .",
    "however this does not affect the conclusions in this work .",
    "our scope here was not to advocate or rule out specific models but rather to make a generic model - independent prediction whether evidence for new physics exists .",
    "upcoming data from weak lensing surveys and data from wmap will improve our bounds on modifications and allow an analysis of models on a case by case basis . with the current data available for the acceleration of the universe and the combined data of cmb+lss",
    "our result is that the best fit are models that contain two modified sources : a late - time modified friedman equation which uniquely alters the isw effect ; as well as a modified perturbation source which changes the clustering properties at large scales.a generic prediction for this type of string modifications is the lack of correlations between @xmath24 . if weak lensing data finds a suppressed @xmath175 spectrum at large scales than this is strong evidence for the existence of two different sources for @xmath135 and @xmath128 .",
    "also , the upcoming measurement of @xmath136-type polarization by wmap may give clues to the physical nature of the large scale features .",
    "models with late time modified gravity predict essentially no modification in the @xmath136-polarization spectrum , as opposed to models with early time gravity modifications and/or inflationary potential features which do predict a direct modification of the primordial power spectrum and therefore also of the @xmath136-polarization .",
    "therefore improvement of @xmath180 data expected in a near future from wmap will allow us to better discriminate among various models and mechanisms .",

    "there are many models in literature which aim at explaining them .",
    "models with modified gravity on very large scales and modified clustering look promising .",

    "<S> we propose a new method for identifying new physics imprints on present observational data in cosmology whereby signatures of string theory are clearly distinguished from imprints of possible features on the inflaton potential . </S>",
    "<S> our method relies on the cross - correlations spectra of cosmic shear from large scale structure ( lss ) with the cmb temperature anisotropies and e - mode polarization , by using the following properties : inflationary cosmology provides only one source term for all cmb spectra and lss which highly constrains any deviations from the standard predictions ; string theory can add new non - inflationary channels to the source of perturbations as well as modify clustering properties at large scales .    </S>",
    "<S> discrepancies in the source terms of correlations and clustering properties provide the evidence for new physics . </S>",
    "<S> models of single - field inflation with a feature are disfavored even with present data . </S>",
    "<S> upcoming wmap results and future data from weak lensing of lss will further improve our ability to probe new physics in this manner and could open the first direct window to string theory </S>",
