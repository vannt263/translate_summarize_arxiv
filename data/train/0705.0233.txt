    "recent years have seen a large and growing literature concerned with the coordination of a group of autonomous agents , partly due to a broad application of multi - agent systems including flocking / swarming ( e.g. , @xcite ) , formation control ( e.g.,@xcite ) , and sensor networks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "leader - following problem is one of the important coordination problems in the studies of multiple mobile agents . even in some leaderless cases , concepts like  virtual leader \"",
    "are proposed to study cooperative behaviors @xcite .",
    "usually , there is only one leader in the leader - following formulation , though sometimes , the leader may be active with unmeasurable states @xcite .",
    "however , in some practical situations of formation or foraging , the formulation of multiple leaders may be needed . in @xcite , lin _ et al .",
    "_ discussed an interesting model for a group of agents with straight - line formation containing two `` edge leaders '' , where all the agents converge to a uniform distribution on the line segment specified by the two edge leaders . in @xcite ,",
    "a simple model was given to simulate foraging and demonstrate that , the larger the group is , the smaller the proportion of  leaders \" is needed to guide the group .    inspired by @xcite , in this paper we consider the coordination behavior of mobile agents with multiple leaders . by using a neighborhood rule , we show that a group of agents will converge to the polytope formed by the leaders ( that is , the leaders forms the vertex set of the polytope ) in two different cases of interconnection topologies associated with the agents and the leaders , and demonstrate that the collective behavior changes as the connectivity of the interconnection between agents and some leader increases through some simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the problem formulation for multiple leaders .",
    "then , both fixed interconnection topology and switched topology are considered , and the corresponding coordination behaviors are analyzed in sections 3 and section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "two numerical examples are shown . finally , concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "before formulating our problem , we first introduce some basic concepts and notations in graph theory that will be used @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a weighted undirected graph of order @xmath1 with a set of nodes @xmath2 , set of edges @xmath3 , and a weighted adjacency matrix @xmath4\\in \\mathcal{r}^{n \\times n}$ ] with nonnegative elements .",
    "the node indexes belong to a finite index set @xmath5 .",
    "an edge is denoted by @xmath6 , which means node @xmath7 and node @xmath8 are adjacent .",
    "a path from @xmath7 to @xmath8 in @xmath9 is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with @xmath7 and ending with @xmath8 such that the consecutive nodes are adjacent .",
    "if there is a path between any two nodes of a graph @xmath9 , then @xmath9 is connected , otherwise disconnected .",
    "an induced subgraph @xmath10 of @xmath9 that is maximal , subject to being connected , is called a component of @xmath9 .",
    "the element @xmath11 associated with the edge of the graph is positive , i.e. @xmath12 . moreover , we assume @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "the set of neighbors of node @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "a diagonal matrix @xmath16 is a degree matrix of @xmath9 , whose diagonal elements @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "then the laplacian of the weighted graph @xmath9 is defined as @xmath19 the following result is well - known in algebraic graph theory ( e.g. @xcite ) and establishes a direct relationship between the graph connectivity and its laplacian .    [ lem1 ] let @xmath9 be a graph on @xmath1 vertices with laplacian @xmath20 . denote the eigenvalues of @xmath20 by @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 and @xmath24^{t}\\in r^n$ ] is its eigenvector .",
    "moreover , if @xmath25 is connected , @xmath26 .",
    "next , we introduce some notations in convex analysis @xcite and linear algebra @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is said to be convex if @xmath29 whenever @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "a vector sum @xmath32 is called a convex combination of @xmath33 if the coefficients @xmath34 are all non - negative and @xmath35 . here",
    ", @xmath34 can be interpreted as proportions .",
    "the intersection of all convex sets containing @xmath28 is the convex hull of @xmath28 , denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "the convex hull of a finite set of points @xmath37 is a polytope , denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 are linearly independent , the set of points @xmath33 is said to be affinely independent .",
    "then the polytope is called an @xmath40 dimensional simplex and @xmath33 are called the vertices of the simplex .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a system consisting of @xmath1 agents and @xmath41 leaders , and the interconnection topology among them can easily be described by a simple graph .",
    "the purpose of the leaders is to guide the multi - agent behavior .",
    "denote the positions of these static leaders by @xmath42 .",
    "the interconnection topology @xmath9 associated with @xmath1 agents can be fixed or variable but may not be connected .",
    "if we regard the polytope formed by leaders as a virtual node and if one agent can see a vertex ( i.e. some leader ) of the polytope , we say that the agent is connected to the virtual node . by `` the graph , @xmath43 , of this system",
    "is connected '' , we mean that at least one agent in each component of @xmath25 is connected to the virtual node .",
    "then we define a diagonal matrix @xmath44 to be a leader adjacency matrix associated with @xmath45 with diagonal elements @xmath46 such that each @xmath47 is some positive number if agent @xmath7 is connected to the virtual node and @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "a continuous - time dynamics of @xmath1 agents is described as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 can be the position of agent @xmath7 and @xmath51 its interconnection control inputs for @xmath18 . as usual , we propose a neighbor - based feedback control as follows : @xmath52 where nonnegative functions @xmath53 if and only if agent @xmath7 is connected to leader @xmath54 when @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and switching signal @xmath57 ( @xmath58 denotes the total number of all possible digraphs ) is a switching signal that determines the interconnection topology @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath59 is a constant function , then the corresponding interconnection topology is fixed .",
    "denote @xmath60 let @xmath61 be a diagonal matrix with non - negative diagonal entry @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64\\in r^{n\\times nk}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath65 .",
    "then we rewrite the closed - loop system in a compact form : @xmath66 with a set - valued function @xmath67\\otimes i_m x_0|p\\in \\mathcal{p}\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the kronecker product .    throughout the paper",
    ", @xmath70 denotes the euclidean norm and @xmath71 denotes inner product on @xmath72 . for non - empty @xmath73 , @xmath74 denotes its euclidean distance function given by @xmath75 .",
    "the objective of this work is to lead all the agents to enter the region formed by the leaders ; namely , @xmath76 , for each agent @xmath7 , will be contained in a convex hull of @xmath77 as @xmath78 . in other words , @xmath79 in the following sections , the convergence of the system ( [ eq1 ] ) will be studied based on @xmath80 , with either fixed interconnection topology or switched interconnection topology .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the convergence analysis of a group of dynamic agents with fixed interconnection topology . in this case",
    ", the subscript @xmath59 can be dropped",
    ".    then the differential inclusion ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath81\\otimes i_m x_0.\\ ] ]    the next lemma shows the relationship between the positive definiteness of a matrix @xmath82 and the connectivity of @xmath45 , which was proved in @xcite .",
    "[ lem2 ] if graph @xmath83 is connected , then the symmetric matrix @xmath84 associated with @xmath83 is positive definite .",
    "then a main result associated with the fixed interconnection topology is given as follows :    [ thm1 ] for the system ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ aim ] ) holds if and only if @xmath45 is connected ,    proof : ( sufficiency ) let @xmath85\\otimes i_m x_0 $ ] .",
    "then , from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath86 for any initial value @xmath87 at initial time @xmath88 , the solution of the system ( [ eq3 ] ) is @xmath89 from lemma [ lem2 ] , the eigenvalues of @xmath90 are positive , and therefore , @xmath91 ; namely , @xmath92\\otimes i_m x_0 $ ] , as @xmath93 .",
    "then we only need to prove that each vector @xmath94 can be represented by a convex combination of @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "it is equivalent to prove that @xmath97\\otimes i_m$ ] is a row stochastic matrix which is a non - negative matrix and the sum of the entries in every row equals @xmath98 .    for @xmath84",

    "( necessity ) suppose that @xmath45 is not connected .",
    "without loss of generality , we also suppose that there are @xmath109 components in @xmath9 , where some components are connected with the virtual node .",
    "we can renumber the nodes of @xmath110 such that laplacian matrix associated with @xmath9 takes the following form @xmath111 and , correspondingly , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the laplacian associated with those components connected with the virtual node , @xmath114 is a nonzero diagonal matrix and @xmath48 s denote some appropriate zero matrices .",

    ", it follows that @xmath119 agents corresponding to @xmath120 will approach to the leaders for an arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "however , the other agents corresponding to @xmath121 will stay static or diverge to some distinct locations which can arbitrarily exist and may not belong to the polytope @xmath122 .",
    "this leads to a contradiction .    ' '' ''    if @xmath123 , then theorem [ thm1 ] will be consistent with theorem 4 in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider the system ( [ eq1 ] ) associated with switched interconnection topology .",
