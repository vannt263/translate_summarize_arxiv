    "it is quite recent that the effective field theory ( eft ) has put its first step toward the realm of hadronic weak interaction .",
    "@xcite an experiment to measure parity - violation ( pv ) effects in polarized neutron capture by a proton at lansce and its upgrade at sns have evoked interest in exploring the pv phenomena in few nucleon systems in the context of eft .",
    "@xcite the results obtained thus far indicate that eft is a working machine for the study of the pv processes ; perturbative expansion converges well in both interactions and transition operators .",
    "inspired by the precedent success of the eft in pv , we try to formulate the pv eft as simple as possible so that it will be feasible to explore various few nucleon pv phenomena with it .",
    "pionless eft with dibaryon fields has proven one of the most efficient efts applicable to few nucleon systems at low energies .",
    "@xcite pv eft with dibaryon fields was already considered by savage @xcite , but only a part of more general pionless pv lagrangian was accounted in the work . in this work , we construct pionless pv lagrangian with dibaryon fields at leading order , and calculate the pv observable in @xmath0 at threshold .",
    "we discuss how the present result can be compared with previous theoretical calculations .",
    "pv dibaryon - nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) lagrangian can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the isospin change at the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "for the two nucleon system , @xmath4 because of the total angular momentum conservation , allowed transitions due to the pv interaction for the lowest angular momentum states are @xmath5 , and @xmath6 due to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 due to @xmath9 .",
    "introducing dimensionless pv @xmath1 coupling constants @xmath10 , we have the pv @xmath1 lagrangians @xmath11 for the isospin conserving part and @xmath12 for the isospin changing one .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two - nucleon dibaryon fields in @xmath15 and @xmath16 states , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 s and @xmath18 s in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lwk0s],[eq : lwk0t],[eq : lwe1 t ] ) project the neutron - proton system into @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 states , respectively .",
    "an observable is the pv photon polarization defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total cross section with the photon of helicity @xmath24 @xmath25 . with pv interactions , @xmath26 is given as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the parity - conserving ( pc ) m1 and parity - violating e1 amplitudes , respectively .",
    "pc m1 amplitude has been calculated very accurately in the pionless eft with dibaryons @xcite , and we employ the result in this work .",
    "feynman diagrams for the process are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgnp ] .",
    "it has been shown in the literature that the pv polarization depends on isoscalar and isotensor components of the meson - exchange pv potential . in our framework , isospin conserving weak lagrangians given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lwk0s],[eq : lwk0 t ] ) contribute to @xmath30 . in the diagrams ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we have the initial @xmath16 state , and @xmath31 state is admixed in the initial state by the weak lagrangian @xmath32 , @xmath33 since the leading e1 transition operator conserves the total spin , we have the pv amplitude from the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the e1 transition operator . for the diagram ( c ) we have a parity admixture in the final state , @xmath36 we then have the pv transition amplitudes @xmath37 we employ the convection current operator of the nucleon for @xmath35 , which is proportional to the nucleon momentum . counting the order of on - shell momentum in each diagram , diagram ( a ) is suppressed to diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the outgoing nucleon momentum . consequently diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) give leading contributions , and we obtain the results in the @xmath40 limit as @xmath41 @xmath42 is the scattering length for the @xmath15 scattering state , @xmath43 is the effective range for the @xmath16 bound state , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the deuteron binding energy . with the pc m1 amplitude obtained from the same theory , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a low energy constant fixed from the @xmath49 total cross section at threshold .",
    "using the pionless eft with dibaryon fields , we calculated the pv polarization in @xmath50 at threshold . though the use of the eft makes the calculation simple and easy , physical meaning of the result is not as transparent as the one obtained from the meson exchange picture of the weak @xmath51 potential , so called the ddh potential @xcite . in order to better figure out the physical meaning of the present result , and",
    "eventually make the eft a useful method for pv phenomenology , it is necessary to have the relation between the  new \" and  old \" languages .",
    "there are several steps to establish the connection .",
    "first , we have to relate the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants in the ddh potential to the pv @xmath1 vertices .",
    "starting point may be the pionful eft .",
    "expanding the pionful pv potential to a certain order , and then integrating out the pion degree of freedom , we obtain the relation between pionful and pionless theories .",
    "second , we have to be cautious in treating the em operators for the external photons .",
    "most of the calculation in the literature assumes siegert s theorem for the e1 operator . in ref .",
    ", it was shown that the pv asymmetry in @xmath52 with convection current ( adopted in this work ) overestimates the result with siegert s theorem by a factor of 2.9 .",
    "it was shown in the same reference that the meson - exchange terms strongly cancel the convection term contribution , and thus make the net result similar to the one with siegert s theorem .",
    "understanding the role of higher order operators may be crucial to put a bridge between pionful and pionless results .",
    "if the relation is well understood and thus the pionless eft with dibaryon fields becomes an understandable language in the hadronic weak interaction , the method can be applied to a broader range of few - body pv phenomena .",
