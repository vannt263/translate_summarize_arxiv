    "although the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity was discovered more than twenty - five years ago @xcite , the dynamical mechanism behind it still remains a mystery today . the reason may be readily identified : due to the nonperturbative nature of the problem , analytic studies usually suffer from uncontrolled approximations , while numerical simulations of the microscopic hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1-type models suffer from a severe fermion sign problem away from half - filling .    in the present work",
    ", we will address the physics of the antiferromagnetic precursors of high - temperature superconductivity from a universal and model - independent point of view , based on the method of effective lagrangians .",
    "the effective lagrangian method is very well - established in particle physics , where chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite represents the effective theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it operates in the goldstone boson sector of qcd , taking into account the octet of the pseudoscalar mesons that emerge due to the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite is an extension of chpt as it also includes heavy particles such as the baryon octet or decuplet , i.e.  those degrees of freedom that remain massive in the chiral limit .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is also a very common phenomenon in condensed matter physics : magnons e.g.  are the goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken spin symmetry @xmath2 , while phonons emerge due to a spontaneously broken translation symmetry . for these systems",
    "effective lagrangians have been constructed in refs .",
    "@xcite and various applications have been considered in refs .",

    "however , the incorporation of heavy degrees of freedom in the condensed matter domain  in a transparent and systematic manner  has only been achieved recently .",
    "an effective theory for weakly doped antiferromagnets , the analog of baryon chiral perturbation theory , has been constructed for hole- and electron - doped antiferromagnets on the square lattice in refs.@xcite and for hole - doped antiferromagnets on the honeycomb lattice in ref.@xcite .",
    "further applications of the formalism were discussed in refs.@xcite , demonstrating that the effective lagrangian method allows one to gain insight into the physics of these insulating precursors of high - temperature superconductors in a systematic and unambiguous manner .    in this presentation",
    "we will focus on hole - doped antiferromagnets on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "we first review the systematic construction of the effective lagrangian for magnons and holes for these systems and will then consider two applications of the formalism : the emergence of spiral phases in the staggered magnetization order parameter as well as the formation of two - hole bound states mediated by magnon exchange .",
    "we would also like to point out that in a recent article on an analytically solvable microscopic model for a hole - doped ferromagnet in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite , the correctness of the effective field theory approach was demonstrated by comparing the effective theory predictions with the microscopic calculation .",
    "likewise , in a series of high - accuracy investigations of the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath3 quantum heisenberg model on a square lattice using the loop - cluster algorithm @xcite , the monte carlo data were confronted with the analytic predictions of magnon chiral perturbation theory and the low - energy constants were extracted with permille accuracy .",

    "let us divide the symmetries of the hubbard model into two categories : continuous symmetries , which are internal symmetries of eq.([hubhspin ] ) , and discrete symmetries , which are symmetry transformations of the underlying honeycomb lattice depicted in figure 1 .     and @xmath16 .",

    ".    we find it quite remarkable that the @xmath108-wave character of the two - hole bound state on the honeycomb lattice is an immediate consequence of our systematic effective field theory analysis .",
    "the question regarding the true symmetry of the pairing state realized in the dehydrated version of na@xmath164coo@xmath165 h@xmath164o , still seems to be controversial @xcite .",
    "still , a careful analysis of the available experimental data for this compound suggests that the pairing symmetry indeed is @xmath108-wave @xcite .",
    "the effective theory for the insulating antiferromagnetic precursors of high - temperature superconductors is the condensed matter analog of baryon chiral perturbation theory : magnons play the role of the pseudoscalar mesons , while the holes and electrons are the analog of the baryon octet .",
    "we have analyzed the symmetries of the underlying hubbard and @xmath166-type models in detail and reviewed the systematic construction of the effective low - energy field theory for weakly hole - doped antiferromagnets on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the procedure is fully systematic order by order in a derivative expansion of the magnon and hole fields . as two nontrivial applications we have considered the existence of spiral phases in the staggered magnetization order parameter and the formation of two - hole bound states mediated by magnon exchange .    regarding spiral phases ,",
    "we have limited ourselves to constant composite vector fields @xmath167 which implies that the fermions experience a constant background field . unlike",
    "in the square lattice case , due to the accidental continuous @xmath105 spatial rotation symmetry , at leading order a spiral does not have an a priori preferred spatial direction .",
    "however , since the @xmath105 symmetry is broken explicitly by the higher - order terms , once such terms are included , one expects the spiral to align with a lattice direction .",
    "we also investigated the stability of spiral phases in the presence of 4-fermion couplings .",
    "if these couplings can be treated perturbatively , for sufficiently large values of @xmath120 , the homogeneous phase is energetically favored . with decreasing @xmath120 , a two - pocket spiral becomes energetically more favorable .",
    "in contrast to the square lattice case , the one - pocket spiral is never favored . for small values of",
    "@xmath120 the two - pocket spiral becomes unstable against the formation of inhomogeneities of a yet undetermined type .",
    "regarding the formation of two - hole bound states mediated by magnon - exchange , we have studied the effect of the magnon - hole vertex .",
    "again in contrast to the square lattice case , it turned out that the magnon - hole coupling constant @xmath83 must exceed a critical value in order to obtain two - hole bound states .",
    "our analysis implies that the wave function for the ground state of two holes of flavors @xmath89 and @xmath90 exhibits @xmath108-wave symmetry ( while the corresponding probability distribution seems to suggest @xmath161-wave symmetry ) .",
    "this is quite different from the square lattice case , where the wave function for the ground state of two holes of flavors @xmath89 and @xmath90 exhibits @xmath162-wave symmetry ( while the corresponding probability distribution resembles @xmath163 symmetry ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that all these results unambiguously follow from the very few basic assumptions of the systematic low - energy effective theory , such as symmetry , locality , and unitarity .",
    "the effective theory provides a theoretical framework in which the low - energy dynamics of lightly hole - doped antiferromagnets can be investigated in a systematic manner .",
    "in particular , after the low - energy parameters have been adjusted appropriately , the resulting low - energy physics is completely equivalent to the one of the hubbard or @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
