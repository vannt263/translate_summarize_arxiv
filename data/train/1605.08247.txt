    "_ cvpaper.challenge _ is a joint project aimed at reading papers mainly in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition  , http://www.slideshare.net/cvpaperchallenge[slideshare @cvpaper.challenge ( http://www.slideshare.net/cvpaperchallenge ) ] ]",
    ". currently the project is run by around ten members representing different organizations ; namely , aist , tdu , and university of tsukuba  .",
    "reading international conference papers clearly provides various advantages other than gaining an understanding of the current standing of your own research , such as acquiring ideas and methods used by researchers around the world . in reality , however , although this input of knowledge is important , researchers and engineers are too busy to have time to do it , and the process takes a great amount of time and effort for undergraduate and graduate students ( particularly master s course students ) who lack research experience and entails sacrificing their time for classes and research . assigning this work , however , to non - experts who are not familiar with the field of computer vision , results in a great amount of time needed for interpreting the papers . as a way to address this problem",
    ", we believe that we can make it relatively easier to grasp advanced technologies if we share and systematize knowledge using the japanese language .",
    "we therefore undertook to extensively read papers , summarize them , and share them with others working in the same field . the ieee - sponsored conference on computer vision and pattern recognition ( cvpr )",
    "is known as the premier conference in the field of computer vision , pattern recognition , and related fields .",
    "cvpr , which is held annually in the u.s .",
    ", has on average around 20% acceptance rate for submitted papers , making it a very difficult conference to hurdle , and pointing to the high quality of the accepted papers .",
    "also , cvpr is also known to comprehensively cover papers in the different fields in computer vision and pattern recognition .",
    "a number of prominent international researchers and research groups choose their research themes after a comprehensive grasp of almost all papers presented in premier conferences and an understanding of research trends .",
    "we believe that the accuracy by which research themes are chosen can be improved by constantly being updated on cutting - edge technologies and discussing these new technology trends within the research groups as part of their regular activities .",
    "further , a survey of papers presented in premier conferences is also an essential way to gather tools needed for research .",
    "we therefore believe that gaining an understanding of papers presented in premier conferences is the best method for authors to comprehend the latest trends in computer vision , pattern recognition , and related fields . as the first step of this endeavor",
    ", we undertook to read all the 602 papers accepted during the cvpr2015  @xcite .",
    "this review summarizes all the papers of cvpr2015 we read as the first project of cvpaper.challenge . in this paper",
    ", we will describe the characteristics of cvpr2015 and discuss the trends and leading methods used in three areas ; namely , recognition , 3d , and imaging / image processing .",
    "further , we will enumerate the proposed datasets and new research problems presented at the conference and propose the concept of  deepsurvey \" .",
    "finally , we will give a summary and discuss future steps .",
    "we would like to stress , however , that this paper mainly focuses on a survey of the research trends , and does not cover the details of all the 602 papers , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an example of a related initiative is the japanese chi study group that undertook to read all the papers presented at the acm chi conference on human factors in computing systems , the top conference for user interfaces  @xcite . in 2015 , the study group was held jointly in tokyo and hokkaido using a remote conference system to read within one day all the 485 papers presented at chi2015 .",
    "speakers were assigned one session each and introduced one paper in approximately 30 seconds .",
    "the chi study group started in 2006 , and is on its 10th year in 2015 .",
    "this initiative is a very effective way to grasp trends in the user interface domain , which is a very progressive field .",
    "it is noteworthy that several japanese researchers have received the best paper and honorable mention awards at chi2015 .",
    "considering the rapid progress in the field , the authors focused on  reading all the papers included in the international conference and summarizing trends through the project , \" as well as on listening to the introduction of the papers by project members .",
    "the chi study group , therefore , serves its role in terms of covering all the papers .",
    "however , understanding the trends in a research field entails comprehensively reading all papers outside particular domains and holding discussions after reading the papers .",
    "we believe that trends can only be properly identified through discussions within the small group that undertook to read all the papers .",
    "this paper is mainly divided into three main areas ; namely , ( i ) recognition , ( ii ) 3d , and ( iii ) imaging / image processing .",
    "before we proceed with discussing the details of each area , we will first explain the features and perspectives gleaned from the titles of the papers and of the papers selected for oral presentation .",
    "figure  [ figure : wordle ] shows a visualization of the titles of papers at cvpr2015 using wordle  @xcite , a word - visualization service .",
    "we see that other than  image \" as the most frequent word , which is expected , we also see that the words  deep , \"  learning , \"  object , \" and  recognition \" are very prominent .",
    "as can be seen from this word visualization and goes without saying , deep learning ( dl ) is a widely used tool in image recognition in researches presented at cvpr2015 .",
    "results of a search among cvpr2015 papers showed that the term was found in 250 out of the 602 papers .",
    "although deep learning was mainly used for object recognition , since r - cnn  @xcite was proposed , it also came to be used more for object detection .",
    "also , with detection and recognition becoming more accurate , there are now more research initiatives to address semantic segmentation , which is an even more difficult problem . meanwhile , the paper that received the best paper award dealt with the method called dynamicfusion  @xcite , which pertains to real - time construction of high - resolution 3d models .",
    "the research was recognized for being able to successfully reconstruct non - rigid models in real time , in addition to being able to reconstruct in higher resolution than kinectfusion  @xcite .",
    "as shown by the prominence of the words  reconstruction , \"  depth , \" and  shape , \" 3d research is also progressing at a steady pace .",
    "also , deep learning is also being applied in stereo matching and 3d features , indicating the widening applications of deep learning . even in imaging technologies , deblurring and sensing technologies are being updated , wherein examples of applications of feature extraction through deep learning were reported .",
    "the 12 oral sessions are presented in cvpr2015 as below :    * cnn architectures * depth and 3d surfaces * discovery and dense correspondences * 3d shape : matching , recognition , reconstruction * images and language * multiple view geometry * segmentation in images and video * 3d models and images * action and event recognition * computational photography * learning and matching local features * image and video processing and restoration      with cnn as the most widely used approach in deep learning , the theme of the first oral presentation was on cnn architecture .",
    "first we would like to mention about googlenet  @xcite , the winner of the ilsvrc2014 with a record 6.67% top-5 error rate .",
    "googlenet is a 22-layers cnn architecture , where convolutional structures are recursively connected to make a deep structure . some presentations dealt with addressing the conventional problems in image recognition through deep learning , such as methods to implement multi - layer or multi - instance learning in order to achieve flexibility through shape change  @xcite , implementing optimization and repetition through bayesian optimization in the periphery of highly likely candidate regions in order to correct errors in object detection using r - cnn  @xcite , proposal of a robust expression to withstand positional invariability and deformations  @xcite , etc .",

    "there was also a proposal for inferring what a store is selling based on the storefront image  @xcite .",
    "streetview images were used to extract characters through ocr , and ontology from those characters was used to classify stores according to business category .",
    "we are proposing deepsurvey ( see figure 2 ) as a mechanism for the systematization of knowledge , the generation of ideas , and as well as the writing of papers ( specially for new research problems ) based on an extensive reading of papers .",
    "deepsurvey architecture is devised based on deeplearning , which has flourished in recent years , and is composed of the following elements :    * input : input the papers read ( knowledge ) * 1st ideas : individually generate ideas ( from knowledge to ideas ) * 1st discussion : group discussion ( consolidation of ideas ) * 2nd ideas : generate more ideas based on consolidated ideas * 2nd discussion : further refinement of ideas * 1st implementation : pick - up and hackathon * 2nd implementation : full - scale implementation and experiment * output : paper    in comparison with general convolutional neural networks ( cnn )  @xcite , `` ideas '' can be replaced with `` convolution layer , '' `` discussion '' with `` pooling , '' and `` implementation '' with `` fully connected layer '' to make it easier to understand . in `` pooling '' ( discussion ) , multiple ideas are collected and good ideas are inputted as they are to the next layer , thus , it is closely similar to lp pooling , which simultaneously possesses characteristics of max pooling and average pooling . the strategy is to repeat generation of ideas and discussion , and proceed to implementation once ideas have taken shape .",
    "the current counting of layers include convolutional layers and fully connected layers , thus , the architecture is a four - layer configuration .",
    "the most important feature of this architecture is the method for  becoming a part of the neuron . \" under this framework , since the entire group works as one neural network architecture in real , rather than in virtual space , the group is able to write papers as the final output .",
    "( thankfully , we got first output of deepsurvey  @xcite which includes a conceptual subject integrating semantic segmentation into change detection . )",
    "it is also characterized by project members actually doing the thinking , reading , and writing of papers to enable them to grow , wherein the network itself grows and matures .    for 2015",
    ", there was little time left for implementation and writing of papers , but we would like to write a more refined paper in the next year as well as be able to propose new research problems .",
    "recently , since the structure of the architecture is also becoming deeper ( vggnet  @xcite : 16/19 layers ; resnet  @xcite 50/101/152 layers ) , going forward , we would like to generate more ideas , hold more discussions , and produce more refined ideas , research problems , and papers .",
    "in this survey we comprehensively read papers presented at cvpr2015 to gain an understanding of the trends in computer vision . further , we devised deepsurvey as a mechanism to generate ideas from knowledge and eventually write a paper .",
    "we divided the papers into three areas ; namely , recognition , 3d , and imaging / image processing , and sought to identify new research areas , as a means to expand the limits of the field .",
    "here we are proposing deepsurvey , and , going forward , we have started addressing some of its problems .",
    "the authors are sorting out the current issues and believe that conducting surveys that include a study of technologies is essential also for identifying the next research problems .",
    "further , there is a need to gain the ability to view the field from a wider perspective aside from actually testing the survey results to better understand the issues .",
    "we hope that this initiative would serve as a useful step towards that end .",
