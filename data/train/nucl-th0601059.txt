    "heavy ion reactions present an unique opportunity for the study of nuclear matter under extreme conditions allowing a comprehensive analysis of the phase structure of the underlying theory of strong interactions . in this",
    "process electromagnetic probes such as dileptons have been proven to be most effective since they leave the reaction zone essentially undistorted by final state interactions .",
    "they provide thus a clear view on effective degrees of freedom at high baryon density and temperature .",
    "it has been argued that their differential spectra could reveal information about chiral restoration and in - medium properties of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , there exists an abundance of models that predict a change of vector meson masses and widths in high density / temperature nuclear matter : brown - rho scaling  @xcite is equivalent with a decrease of vector meson masses in nuclear medium ; models based on qcd sum rules  @xcite and effective hadronic models  @xcite reach similar conclusions .",
    "experimentally , dilepton spectra have been measured at two different energy regimes : the ceres  @xcite , helios  @xcite and recently na60 @xcite at cern have measured dielectrons and dimuons , respectively , in heavy ion reactions at 158 gev / nucleon . in proton - nucleus reactions",
    "the sum over all measured hadronic sources , i.e. the so - called hadronic cocktail , describes the corresponding dilepton spectra perfectly well .",
    "however , in heavy systems ( pb+au ) a significant enhancement of the dilepton spectra below the the @xmath0 and @xmath1 peaks has been observed relative to the corresponding hadronic cocktail .",
    "such a behaviour could be explained theoretically , within a scenario of a dropping @xmath0 vector meson mass  @xcite or by the inclusion of in - medium spectral functions for the vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "the recent na60 dimuon spectra with high resolution in the vicinity around the @xmath2 peak seem to rule out a naive dropping mass scenario but support the picture of modified @xmath2 spectral functions .",
    "an enhanced strength below the @xmath1 peak has also been observed in @xmath3-nucleus reactions @xcite .",
    "a second set of heavy ion experiments have been performed at laboratory energies of 1.0 agev ( ca+ca and c+c ) by the dls collaboration at bevalac  @xcite .",
    "also in this case , the low mass region of the dilepton spectra is underestimated by present transport calculations , in contrast with similar measurements ( 1.04 - 4.88 gev / nucleon ) for the p+p and p+d systems . as opposed to the ultra - relativistic case",
    ", the situation does not improve when the in - medium spectral functions or the dropping mass scenarios are taken into account  @xcite ( the dsl puzzle ) .",
    "other scenarios like possible contributions from the quark - gluon plasma or in - medium modifications of the @xmath4 mass have been excluded as a possible resolution of this puzzle .",
    "decoherence effects  @xcite have been proven to be partially successful in explaining the difference between the dls data and the theoretical predictions .",
    "recently , a new measurement by the hades collaboration at gsi has been completed and the results will be published in the near future  @xcite . the aim of this second generation experiment is to measure dilepton spectra in a+a , p+a and @xmath5+a reactions with an unprecedented mass resolution ( @xmath6 ) over the entire spectrum @xcite .",
    "such a resolution allows to measure the in - medium properties ( mass and width ) of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons through their decays into dielectron pairs in nuclear matter with high precision and will put strong constraints on theoretical models .",
    "this letter presents predictions of the dilepton production in c+c reactions at 1.0 and 2.0 agev which are those reactions where first data from hades will be available in the near future .",
    "the vector meson and dilepton production is described within the framework of the resonance model developed in @xcite in combination with the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd ) transport model for heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the influence of medium effects such as quantum decoherence , collisional broadening and a dropping vector meson mass are investigated .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section ii we give a brief description of the elementary reactions which contribute to dilepton emission in heavy ion collisions , together with an outline of the rqmd model .",
    "section iii is devoted to the presentation of our prediction for the differential mass spectrum of dilepton production in 1.0 and 2.0 agev c+c collisions .",
    "we conclude with section iv .",
    "the elementary sources of dilepton production in heavy ion reaction in the energy range of a few gev / nucleon are numerous .",
    "one can identify three main classes of processes that lead to dilepton emission : nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , decays of light unflavoured mesons and decay of nucleon and @xmath7 resonances . for the energy range of interest in this paper dilepton generation through nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung",
    "is unimportant .",
    "feynman diagrams of processes belonging to the last two classes are depicted in  .    at incident energies of 1 agev the cross - sections for meson production @xmath8 are small and",
    "these mesons do not play an important role in the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "their production can thus be treated perturbatively , in contrast to the case of the pion .",
    "the decay to a dilepton pair takes place through the emission of a virtual photon .",
    "the differential branching ratios for the decay of a meson to a final state @xmath9 can be written @xmath10 with @xmath11 the meson mass and @xmath12 the dilepton mass .",
    "three types of such decays have been considered : direct decays @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fey_diags]a ) , dalitz decays @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fey_diags]b ) and four - body decays @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fey_diags]c ) .",
    "a comprehensive study of the decay of light mesons to a dilepton pair has been performed in  @xcite , the decay channels there are most important quantitatively for heavy - ion collisions at 1 and 2 gev / nucleon being @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the third source for dilepton emission we have mentioned was the decay of baryonic resonances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fey_diags]d ) . for the description of this process an extension of the vector meson dominance ( vmd )",
    "model has been employed  @xcite .",
    "the original vmd model assumes that decays of baryon resonances run through an intermediate virtual meson ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) required for the description of the form - factors entering in the calculation of the radiative ( @xmath19 ) and mesonic ( @xmath20 ) decays .",
    "such a model does not allow the simultaneous description of both radiative and mesonic decays  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the quark counting rules require a stronger suppression of the transition form - factor than the @xmath21 behaviour predicted by the naive vmd .",
    "similarly the @xmath22 transition form - factor shows an asymptotic @xmath23 behaviour  @xcite .",
    "an extension of the vmd to allow contributions from radially excited vector mesons ( @xmath0(1250 ) , @xmath0(1450),@xmath24 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that interfere destructively with the ground state vector mesons ( @xmath0 in this example ) allow for a resolution of the mentioned problems of the original vmd and describe the radiative and mesonic decays in a unitary way .        in terms of the branching ratios for",
    "the dalitz decays of the baryon resonances , the cross section for @xmath25 production from the initial state @xmath26 together with the final state @xmath27 can be written @xmath28 where @xmath11 is the mass of the baryon resonance @xmath29 which has the production cross - section @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the differential branching ratio for the decay of the resonance @xmath32 through the vector meson @xmath33 .",
    "the initial state @xmath26 could consist of two baryons ( @xmath34 ) or of one nucleon and a pion ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the dilepton decay rate can be found , once the width @xmath36 ) is known by using the factorisation prescription @xmath37 with @xmath38 the decay width @xmath39 is described within the extended vmd model  @xcite in terms of three transition form - factors ( magnetic , electric and coulomb ) in case of a resonance with spin @xmath40 and two for @xmath41 , which is just the number of independent helicity amplitudes for the respective spin value .",
    "the free parameters of the model are fixed by constraining the asymptotic form of the form - factors by quark counting rules  @xcite and fitting to the experimental data for photo - production and electro - production amplitudes and partial - wave analysis for multichannel @xmath42 scattering .",
    "the number of intermediate @xmath0 or @xmath1 states required to describe the transition form - factors depends on the spin @xmath43 of the resonance in question : namely @xmath44 . for the case",
    "that @xmath45 one needs 6 intermediate mesons , with the masses chosen as follows : 0.769 , 1.250 , 1.450 , 1.720 , 2.150 and 2.350 ( in gev ) . within this model a consistent description of radiative and mesonic decays could be achieved .",
    "further details about the extended vmd can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as already mentioned the decay widths @xmath39 are expressed in terms of the magnetic , electric and coulomb form - factors , more precisely they depend on the modulus squared of these form - factors . in the extended vmd",
    "each of these form - factors is in turn expressed as a linear superposition of the contributions from the intermediate vector mesons ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) : @xmath46 with @xmath47 standing for each of possible form - factors , @xmath48 denotes states of normal and abnormal parity respectively and the sum is over the intermediate mesons .",
    "the amplitude @xmath49 represents the contribution of the @xmath50 vector meson to the amplitude of type @xmath47 .",
    "the residues @xmath51 are fixed by the requirement that the asymptotic expression of the form - factors is consistent with the quark counting rules  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a destructive interference between the intermediate vector mesons , since quark counting rules predict a behaviour steeper for the form - factors than the @xmath52 contribution of a single meson . in the medium",
    "it is expected that the coherence between the contributions of individual mesons is at least partially lost . in the extreme case of total decoherence",
    ", this would lead to the following replacement in the expression for the decay width , @xmath53 which will result in an enhancement of the resonance contributions . in reality both , the density and wavelength of the meson are finite . introducing the decay length @xmath54 of a resonance and its collision length",
    "@xmath55 one can determine the probability of coherent decay ( @xmath56 the meson decay takes place before the first collision ) as @xmath57 . in order to account for the decoherence effect",
    ", one can introduce an enhancement factor @xmath58 , @xmath59 the dependence on the space - like part @xmath60 of the vector meson momentum originates from the definition of the collision length @xmath55 .",
    "further details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the heavy - ion reaction dynamics is described within the framework of relativistic quantum molecular dynamics .",
    "the tbingen ( r)qmd transport code @xcite has been extended to include all nuclear resonances with masses below 2 gev , in total 11 @xmath61 and 10 @xmath7 resonances . a full list with the corresponding masses and decay widths to various channels can be found in tables iii and iv of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the description of dilepton production through baryonic resonances ,",
    "respectively , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in @xmath62 and @xmath42 reactions , only the well established ( 4@xmath63 ) resonances listed by pdg  @xcite are taken into account .",
    "this corresponds to the same set of resonances which has been used for the description of vector meson and dilepton production in elementary ( p+p ) reactions @xcite , see also  @xcite . as necessary for the present investigations , it provides e.g. an accurate reproduction of the measured pion yields in c+c reactions @xcite within error bars . for the case of the @xmath4 meson , the fit of ref .",
    "@xcite is used and therefore the production through the decay of nucleonic resonances is completely neglected .",
    "a check of the two production mechanisms @xmath64 and @xmath65 has been performed leading to an almost similar @xmath4 yield in heavy ion reactions .",
    "@xmath4 absorption runs over the @xmath66 resonance .",
    "the corresponding @xmath4 production cross sections in c+c collisions are consistent with the experimental results of ref .",
    "it is expected that in nuclear matter the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons change their properties .",
    "estimates for the collisional broadening of @xmath0 in hadronic matter ( nuclear matter or pionic gas ) predict a collisional width of the order of the vacuum width . for the @xmath1",
    "the vacuum width is only 8.4 mev whereas in medium is expected to be more than one order of magnitude larger .",
    "the dilepton spectra at intermediate energies , like those probed by the hades and also the dls experiments , are more sensitive to the @xmath67 meson collisional broadening . in absence of such modifications",
    "the invariant mass dilepton spectrum would show a pronounced @xmath1 peak . in the dls experiment such an enhancement has not been observed . despite the limited mass resolution in  @xcite an in - medium @xmath1 width of @xmath68 mev at nuclear matter density @xmath0",
    "= 1.5@xmath69 has been extracted from the dls data .",
    "the modification of the @xmath0 width was found to be similar in magnitude , i.e. @xmath70 mev ( again at @xmath0 = 1.5@xmath69 ) . in the present calculations",
    "a linear density dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay widths is assumed , i.e. @xmath71 . as an additional in - medium effect the masses of the mesons are supposed to vary as a function of the nuclear matter density at the point where the resonance decay occurs , following a brown - rho scaling law @xmath72 with @xmath0 the local baryon density and @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite the dropping mass scenario is now included in addition to the collisional broadening and decoherence medium effects .",
    "a second medium effect is the due to decoherence , which mostly affects the dilepton spectrum below the @xmath74 peak .",
    "the probability for coherent decay depends both on the in - vacuum decay widths ( through @xmath54 ) and the collisional broadening ( through @xmath55 ) . for the ground state vector mesons the following values for the collisional widths",
    "have been adopted : @xmath75=100 mev and @xmath76=116.6 mev at @xmath77 with the same values for their radially excited states that enter in the built up of the extended vmd .",
    "the vacuum widths of the radially excited mesons are larger than those of the ground state @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson and as a consequence they tend to decay coherently .",
    "the decoherence effect is largest for the @xmath1 vector meson since its vacuum width is very small .",
    "the results for c+c collisions at 1 and 2 agev are shown in  .",
    "besides the dilepton spectrum with in - vacuum properties of the intermediate mesons ( depicted by a dashed line ) the effects of three different in - medium scenarios on the same spectrum are also shown .",
    "the calculation in which all the in - medium effects are included to their full extent is depicted by a full line .",
    "this case corresponds to maximal collisional broadening , i.e. @xmath78=125 mev , @xmath79=250 mev , both at @xmath77 , and it includes brown - rho scaling for the meson masses and decoherence effects .",
    "the remaining three calculations provide insight on the significance of the individual in - medium effects , even tough strictly speaking they can not be disentangled .",
    "the variation of the @xmath0 meson width between @xmath80 mev leads to a modification of the dilepton yield by a factor of 2 in the dilepton mass range 0.5 - 0.8 gev ( compare the full and dashed - dotted curves ) .",
    "decoherence effects in nuclear medium are responsible for at most a 50@xmath81 change in the dilepton spectra at intermediate masses ( dotted and full lines )",
    ".    some of the @xmath1 mesons , produced in the final stages of the collision or at the surface of the interaction region might escape with vacuum properties and thefore lead to a small peak in the dilepton cross - section .",
    "the density dependent meson widths include these possibilties . to explore the possibility of a reminiscent @xmath1 peak in more detail an additional calculation with a moderate in - medium @xmath1 width @xmath78= 60 mev , together with @xmath79=200 mev , ( again at @xmath69 )",
    "it should be noted that such a value for @xmath78 is in agreement with the analysis of @xcite from photo - nucleus reactions .",
    "an increase of at most 50@xmath81 in the dilepton yield is observed with respect to the full in - medium scanario in the 0.4 - 0.8 gev mass region , with no sign of a sharp peak .",
    "the effect of the brown - rho scaling is well known : it produces a shift of the @xmath74 peak from its vacuum position towards lower dilepton invariant masses , namely around 0.6 gev .",
    "the peak dissolves once the width of the @xmath1 meson is changed to its in - medium value .",
    "all results have been obtained with a strong @xmath82 coupling as enforced by the fit of the resonance model parameter to nucleon resonance electro- and photo - production @xcite and which has been used in @xcite .",
    "the results of are pure theoretical results , @xmath83 they have not been filtered in order to account for the experimental detector acceptance .",
    "such a procedure is , however , indispensable for a meaningful comparison to data . in order to investigate up to what degree",
    "the hades experiment will be able to discriminate between the different scenarios , we apply in the following the full hades acceptance filter in combination with a smearing procedure for the corresponding hades mass resolution .",
    "the filtered results are shown in in fig .",
    "[ ccfilter_fig ] .",
    "the in - medium calculation contains the combination of all medium effects under consideration , i.e. @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisional broadening and mass shifts and decoherence ( corresponding to the full lines in  ) .",
    "the spectra are normalised to the number of events @xmath84 and to the @xmath85 multiplicity .",
    "contributions from @xmath85 and @xmath4 dalitz decay are shown separately .",
    "the difference between the vacuum and the in - medium calculation is still clearly visible : most pronounced are the medium effects in the mass region around the @xmath74 peak ( @xmath86 gev ) where a complete dissolution of the @xmath0 and in particular the @xmath1 peak is predicted .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced at 2 agev and the hades experiment will be able to clearly discriminate between the vacuum and the in - medium scenarios .    in the low and intermediate mass region",
    "the medium effects are less pronounced , i.e. of the order of about 50% .",
    "decoherence affects the dilepton pairs over almost the entire spectrum .",
    "it is , however , the only source for in - medium changes at low invariant dilepton masses , below 0.4 gev . to discriminate the various scenarios experimentally in the low and intermediate mass region",
    "will be difficult , at least in the light c+c system .",
    "however , keeping in mind that medium effects are often better visible at subthreshold energies as known e.g. from kaon production @xcite , it is natural to build the ratio between the spectra at 1 and 2 agev .",
    "this is done in   where the ratio of the dilepton spectra at 1 and 2 agev for the in - vacuum ( dashed line ) and in - medium ( full line ) scenarios are plotted . here",
    "aswell the theoretical predictions have been filtered using the hades acceptance filter which allows to infer the correctness of the conjecture concerning the relevance of such effects directly from experiment .",
    "( 11.,8.0 ) ( 0,0 )    from one observes a stronger in - medium enhancement of the low mass yield at 1 agev compared to 2 agev which results in a smaller value for the ratio .",
    "the effect is , however at the 20 - 30% level which requires very high resolution data .",
    "in this paper we have presented predictions for the dilepton emission in heavy ion reactions at c+c at 1 and 2 agev .",
    "experimental data for these two reactions will be available in the near future from the hades collaboration at gsi .",
    "a clear distinction between vacuum and in - medium scenarios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 properties is possible in the mass region around the @xmath74 peak . in particular at 2 gev",
    "the effect from an in - medium broadening of the vector mesons is dramatic and leads to a strong suppression of the spectrum . at low invariant masses the in - medium effects , in particular the decoherence , are less pronounced , i.e. on the 20 - 30% level , but can be expected to be more clearly seen in larger systems than c+c .",
