    "an hypernucleus is a bound system of nonstrange and strange baryons and it is an important source of information about baryon - baryon strangeness - changing weak interactions . in the present contribution ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath0-hypernuclei , which can be produced by an hadronic reaction - such as @xmath6 - or by an electromagnetic one - such as @xmath7 . the @xmath0 is generally formed in an excited state and then , via the emission of a series of @xmath8-rays , it reaches its ground @xmath9-state .",
    "the @xmath0 decays itself mainly via the weak interaction by two decay mechanisms : the so - called mesonic decay @xmath10 and the non - mesonic one @xmath11 , where no meson is present in the final state @xmath12 .",
    "the mesonic decay is the main decay process for the free @xmath0 , but when the @xmath0 is within the nuclear environment it is strongly inhibited by the pauli principle . in this case , the non - mesonic weak decay becomes the most important decay mechanism .",
    "this decay can be stimulated either by protons or neutrons , where the corresponding decay widths are denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . just after the @xmath0-decays ,",
    "the resultant nucleons are still within the nucleus and in their way out they can interact strongly with any nucleon of the nucleus . finally , two or more nucleons are ejected from the nucleus and it is the nucleon spectra of these emitted nucleons the magnitude which can be measured . for review articles one can see @xcite , while some of the experimental works are  @xcite .    for the non - mesonic @xmath0-decay , there are two quantities which deserves special attention . the first one is the ratio @xmath15 where theory predicts a value smaller than 0.5 , while the so - called experimental result has a value closer to one .",
    "the second quantity is the asymmetry of the protons emitted in the @xmath16 decay of polarized hypernuclei . in this case , data indicate a value close to zero , while most of the theoretical works predict a large negative number .",
    "just recently , the incorporation of the @xmath17-meson suggests a solution to this problem ( see  @xcite , and references therein ) . in the present work , however , we will not deal with the asymmetry . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the connection between the theory and the experimental results is not straightforward because there is no direct measurement of this ratio .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the decay widths of the so - designed primaries disintegration and as mentioned above , data give us results on the the nucleon spectra which emerge from the nucleus .",
    "the connection between @xmath18 and the nucleon spectra is a theoretical problem in itself . before going on , it is interesting to resume some of the theoretical efforts in dealing with @xmath18 .",
    "the main ingredients required in the evaluation of the transition rate @xmath12 , are the transition potential and the wave functions which represent the @xmath0 and the nucleons .",
    "the first microscopic scheme for @xmath18 has been proposed by adams @xcite , who has used the nuclear matter framework , one pion exchange model ( ope ) , @xmath21 piece of the @xmath22 coupling and short range correlations ( src ) . while this model fairly reproduce the total @xmath16 decay width @xmath23 , it produce ratios smaller than 0.20",
    ". some of the improvements over adams model are : @xmath24 the inclusion of heavier mesons than the pion in the @xmath25transition potential @xcite ; @xmath26 the inclusion of interaction terms that violates the isospin @xmath21 rule has been considered in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath27 the transition potential can be described in terms of the quark degree of freedom  @xcite , which automatically introduces the @xmath28 contribution . and @xmath29 the employment of finite nucleus wave functions instead of plane waves , a scheme usually called wave function method ( wfm )  @xcite . this list does not pretend to be complete .",
    "however , we should mention that in all these works the discrepancy between theory and experiment remains .",
    "we turn now to the interpretation of data . as mentioned , it is the spectra of nucleons emerging from the nucleus , the quantity which is measured .",
    "the nucleons originated in the @xmath0-decay interact strongly with others nucleons before leaving the nucleus .",
    "these interactions are called final state interactions @xmath30 .",
    "again , we can distinguish two issues : @xmath24 the primary decays and @xmath26 a model for the @xmath2 . regarding the first point",
    ", we should note that @xmath12 is not the only @xmath16-weak decay mechanism : the @xmath16-decay width can be also stimulated by two nucleons @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding decay width is called @xmath32 .",
    "this two - body induced decay is originated from ground state correlation in the hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "an estimation of @xmath32 is important in the analysis of data , because this process is a source of nucleons which can not be distinguished from those stemming from @xmath33 .",
    "there are several models for the @xmath2 among which we focus on two of them : the intranuclear cascade code ( inc )  @xcite and the microscopic model developed in  @xcite .",
    "the inc is a semi - phenomenological approach .",
    "the starting point in the inc is the microscopic evaluation of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath32 .",
    "afterwards , the nucleons produced in the weak decay are followed in a semi - classical manner until they leave the nucleus . by means of this emulation of the physical conditions of the hypernuclear decay ,",
    "a more accurate agreement between the theoretical results and the data is achieved .",
    "the analysis of the experimental information using the inc , produce ratios @xmath34 . however , one limitation of the inc is that the quantum interference terms between the primary weak decay reaction @xmath35 and any other reaction which has the same initial and final state , such as @xmath4 , can not be included . on the other hand and to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the microscopic model described in  @xcite , is the only microscopic model which puts in the same level of theoretical effort the weak decay mechanism and the @xmath2 . due to its character",
    ", the microscopic model automatically includes the quantum interference terms .",
    "some details of the microscopic model are given in the next section .",
    "while the theoretical prediction starts with the primary decay and should end in the nucleon spectra , the analysis of the experiment begins with the spectra , goes back and a value for @xmath18 is determined .",
    "this is done using several models , among which the inc is certainly one of the more elaborated ones . it should be noted , that the inc is employed in two ways : for the theoretical prediction of the nucleon spectra and for the interpretation of data . in any case , for the extraction of the @xmath18-experimental value one needs two theoretical inputs : @xmath32 and the @xmath2 .",
    "now , if several models for these inputs produce the same ratio @xmath18 , it is reasonable to name it as the experimental value for @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , an accurate evaluation of the quantum interference terms together with an alternative formalism to the inc , is important .    in the present contribution , we further developed the microscopic model of  @xcite presenting results for the nucleon spectra , with emphasis in the quantum interference terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the microscopic model for the nucleon spectra .",
    "this is done in general terms , including the two - body induced contribution . in section  iii ,",
    "explicit expression within the first order contribution to the rpa are shown . in section",
    "iv , the numerical results are discussed and finally , in section  v we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section the microscopic model developed in  @xcite is briefly summarized with the addition of @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , @xmath32 is the sum of three terms : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in reporting expressions for the single and double nucleon spectra : @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which represent the number of nucleons of kind @xmath41 vs. it kinetic energy , @xmath42 and number of pairs of nucleons @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 or vs. the relative angle between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , respectively . without @xmath2 ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are , @xmath48 where we have used the normalization , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "the index @xmath51 , indicates that there is no @xmath2 .",
    "the multiplicative factors in the right hand side of these equations are the number of particles ( pairs of particles ) of kind @xmath45 ( @xmath43 ) produces by the primary decay .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath52 and @xmath32 are reported in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively . as mentioned",
    ", the nucleon spectra is the number of particles ( or pairs of particles ) which angle or kinetic energy lays within a certain range .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 and @xmath32 are cut into pieces which correspond to certain angles- or kinetic energies - ranges .",
    "this is easily implemented by adding steps functions ( in the integrand of @xmath52 and @xmath32 ) , which limit the integration to such ranges .",
    "the next step is the inclusion of the @xmath2 . to this end",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath53 . this function result from evaluating any possible goldstone diagram for the @xmath0-weak decay , where the strong interaction is present after the weak decay takes place .",
    "the index , @xmath54 , is the final state ( _ i.e. _ the emitted nucleons ) , taking the values : @xmath54=@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc . at variance",
    ", the indices @xmath59 refer to the two primary weak decays of each diagram and can have the values @xmath60or @xmath61 ; which stand for the transitions amplitudes @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "it is important to be aware of the fact that the decay widths , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath67 , etc .",
    ", are the square of a transition amplitude ( @xmath68 or @xmath31 ) . in this sense , @xmath53 does not represent only a decay width , but also some interference terms , which are pure quantum mechanical effects .    by the addition of the @xmath2 in eqs .",
    "( [ nn10]-[npp10 ] ) we obtained , @xmath69 where the factors @xmath70 are the numbers of nucleons of the type @xmath45 in the state @xmath54 . in the same way , @xmath71 are the numbers of pairs of nucleons of the type @xmath43 in the state @xmath54 .",
    "let us give two examples . if @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; and if @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . in these expressions ,",
    "the summation over @xmath59 and @xmath54 , runs over the values of these indices mentioned above .    as a final comment for this section",
    "we make some further considerations about the quantum interference terms .",
    "all decay widths come from the square of a transition amplitude .",
    "when no @xmath2 are included , the only transitions amplitudes are @xmath68 and @xmath31 . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on @xmath68 .",
    "there is no interference term between @xmath62 and @xmath63 because the final state is different .",
    "when the @xmath2 come into play , the strong interaction allows many others transitions amplitudes . in this case , as different reactions can end in the same final state and as the initial state is the same hypernuclei state for all the processes , the total transition amplitude is the sum of all these terms .",
    "the squares of the individual terms , are the decay widths , while the crossed products are the interference terms . within our model ,",
    "@xmath53 contain both decay widths and interference terms .",
    "note that the strong interaction is present in @xmath32 as a ground state correlation , that is , the strong interaction acts before the weak transition potential . as an additional comment about the interference terms",
    ", they can be grouped into two categories : @xmath84 the ones with @xmath85 and @xmath86 the ones with @xmath87 .",
    "it is perhaps more convenient to explain these categories by means of an example .",
    "let us propose three transition amplitudes : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where in the last two expressions the strong interaction is responsible for the second reaction .",
    "there is an interference term between @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xmath85 ) , where the strong interaction appears in first order .",
    "it is clear that the square of @xmath93 is positive , but the interference terms between both terms can be either positive or negative .",
    "finally , the interference terms between @xmath91 and @xmath94 is an example of the @xmath87-category .",
    "in this section we present expressions for the functions @xmath53 , using non - relativistic nuclear matter together with the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , which allows us to discuss any particular hypernucleus .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( [ nn1f]-[npp1f ] ) are general expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . although @xmath53 is completely defined , one has to choose some set of goldstone diagrams which represent the @xmath0-decay to obtain the explicit expressions for this function .",
    "this set has an infinite number of diagrams and _ a priori _ any sub - set of diagrams could be equally important . in this work and as a first step in the evaluation of the nucleon spectra , we have decided to study the rpa - like diagrams .",
    "the direct part of the rpa , known as ring approximation , is perhaps the simplest manner to implement the strong interaction into this problem .",
    "the pauli exchange terms are known to be important for these particular set of diagrams ( see  @xcite ) and consequently the rpa looks as a natural first step . in",
    "@xcite we have presented expressions for @xmath53 within the ring approximation .",
    "however , no comparison with data has been done , because of the absence of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "let us call by @xmath95 a generic function which can be either @xmath52 , @xmath32 or @xmath53 . instead of giving the expression for @xmath95 ,",
    "it is more convenient to work with the partial decay width @xmath96 , where , @xmath97 is the @xmath0 energy - momentum , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the fermi momentum for neutrons and protons , respectively . to evaluate @xmath100 for",
    "a particular nucleus one can use either an effective fermi momentum or the local density approximation . in this work",

    "[ espcomp1 ] we have split @xmath203 into their two isospin components . the first isospin component is the charge - exchange one , where there is a proton in the @xmath0-vertex ( that is , in the @xmath167-position in fig .  [ fig1rpa ] ) .",
    "the second is the charge - conserving contribution , which has a neutron in the just mentioned place .",
    "the first contribution is multiplied by a factor four ( due to the isospin ) , while we have a factor one for the charge - conserving term .",
    "this makes the first contribution to be the dominant one .",
    "notice that the transition potential is not the same for both contributions , because only the isovector terms in the transition potential act for the charge - exchange contribution .",
    "in addition , our results show that the particle attach to the @xmath0-vertex is slower than the other particle .",
    "-free kinetic energy spectra .",
    "the dashed line is the contribution where a proton is attached to the @xmath0-decay vertex , the dotted - dashed line represents the contribution where a neutron is attached to the same vertex , while the continuous line is the total contribution .",
    "units are the same as in fig .",
    "[ espnplib ] . ]",
    "this fact has a simple physical interpretation . in the expression for @xmath20 ( or @xmath19 ) , we take the principal value for the mesons propagators in the transition potential .",
    "as we are getting closer to the pion pole , the energy left to the @xmath167-particle becomes smaller , while the proximity to the pole , makes the contribution more important .",
    "as mentioned above , the inc weighs this contribution with @xmath20 , making no distinction between the inner isospin components .",
    "this fact is not mandatory in the inc , but the available calculations are performed in this way .",
    "we have implemented an isospin average to get rid of the different isospin summation employed in the inc .",
    "we do not reproduce these results , as they simply show the agreement between both methods .",
    "we turn now to the inclusion of @xmath2 . in the present contribution , we have limited the @xmath2 to the first order contribution to the rpa . in table  i , we present our results for @xmath219 , within three different approximations : the first order contribution ( in the nuclear residual interaction ) to the rpa ( @xmath197 ) , the same first order term to the ring series ( @xmath220 ) , and the full ring approximation taken from  @xcite .",
    "the values quoted in this table result from the integration of the spectra over the whole energy region .",
    "the difference between @xmath197 and @xmath220 is the inclusion of the exchange terms . for @xmath221 ,",
    "the exchange terms increase this quantity by @xmath222 , while this percentage is @xmath223 for @xmath224 .",
    "although they are different quantities , it is interesting to comment that the exchange terms produce also an increase of @xmath225 and @xmath226 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "for the two remainders terms , we have an increase ( decrease ) of @xmath227 ( @xmath226 ) for @xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "the next point is to make an estimation of the accuracy of the first order rpa - contribution to account for the full rpa series . to this end , we compare the full ring series with @xmath220 .",
    "we can see that only for @xmath224 , the @xmath220 is an adequate approximation , while there is a strong discrepancy for all the others terms .",
    "the reason for this behavior relays upon the inner isospin structure of the ring ( or rpa ) approximation .",
    "as already stated , the @xmath224 is dominated by graphs where a proton is attached to the @xmath0-weak decay vertex .",
    "the particle - hole bubbles ( which propagates as the ring series ) , are built up from a neutron particle and a proton hole .",
    "the charge - conservation does not allow any other particle - hole configuration .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath221 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and the @xmath224-contribution with a neutron in the @xmath0-vertex .",
    "as an example , we consider the second order contribution to @xmath221 .",
    "this contribution has three particle - hole bubbles .",
    "the upper and lower bubbles can be only a neutron particle - neutron hole configuration .",
    "but the intermediate bubble can be either a neutron particle - neutron hole or a proton particle - proton hole one .",
    "higher order contributions can have more complex configurations ( for details , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the convergence of the ring series is fast only when the particle - hole bubbles are of the same kind . from this analysis",
    ", it can be said that the @xmath197 should be seen as an approximation in itself .",
    "the ring series can be summed up to infinite order in an easy way , but there is no ground to neglect the exchange terms .",
    ".numerical results for @xmath219 , within several approximations .",
    "note that @xmath230 .",
    "the @xmath197 ( @xmath220)-line is the first order contribution to the @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) , while the @xmath232-line represents the total ring approximation take from  @xcite .",
    "all values are given in units of @xmath233 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a final point for this section and beyond the limitations in phase space in the rpa , the nuclear residual interaction employed in the rpa , should be discussed .",
    "to perform this calculation we have chosen the bonn potential where we have neglected src in all results except for the ones in fig .",
    "[ espnptot ] . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the addition of src reduce significantly the @xmath197-contribution .",
    "the interaction without src , has been selected to explore the rpa results under extreme conditions .",
    "the final outcome shows us that the rpa does not alter the free spectra very much .",
    "the addition of src makes this contribution even less important . from this",
    ", we can conclude that the @xmath197 is adequate enough to explore the rpa contribution and from our whole analysis , it is clear that the rpa does not represent the relevant kind of fsi required to describe the @xmath0-weak decay spectra . from the inc",
    "we know that the @xmath2 are important , which states our problem as the finding of the most significant diagrams to account for the @xmath2 .",
    "we do not known _ a priori _ the answer to this question . to obtain some insight about this problem",
    ", the rpa has been a good starting point due to it simplicity .",
    "the search of the relevant set of diagrams has an additional difficulty , which is the selection of the nuclear residual interaction , together with the adjustment of some potential - parameters .",
    "the bonn potential is one possible choice , but the truth is that we do not know the strong interaction in this energy - momentum region .",
    "however , the inc provides us with a powerful tool to settle the strong interaction : in our microscopic scheme it is easy to turn off the interference terms not contained in the inc . under these conditions , and once the adequate set of diagrams are found , the inc - result can be used to fix the strong interaction .",
    "note that the inc does not employ an effective strong interaction but the experimental scattering cross section between nucleons .",
    "this would give us some confidence on the strong interaction so adjusted .",
    "for this particular purpose , the use of the inc is better than the data themselves , because the theoretical model for the weak transition potential would be the same in both the inc and in our microscopic model .",
    "afterwards , the interference terms should be added and a comparison with data should be done . in our opinion , it is this whole schedule the one which should be employed to test our knowledge of the baryon - baryon strangeness - changing weak interactions .",
    "the present contribution is a step forward in this direction . in  @xcite , we have presented our scheme in general terms .",
    "that model has been developed in the present work , but for a particular kind of @xmath2 . in a forthcoming work ,",
    "the @xmath234-decay channel which is not contained in the rpa and can be represented by second order self - energy contributions , will be included . at variance with the present calculation",
    ", this kind of @xmath2 contains both decay widths and interference terms .",
    "the present work address the problem of the theoretical interpretation of the spectra of nucleons emitted from the non - mesonic weak decay of a @xmath0-hypernucleus . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", we have presented for the first time a scheme which deals with this issue using a microscopic formalism .",
    "we have presented results for the single and double kinetic energy spectra and also for the opening angle distribution of @xmath55 and @xmath56 pairs .",
    "the @xmath2 have been incorporated by means of the first order contribution ( in the nuclear residual interaction ) to the rpa .",
    "our formalism naturally contains the quantum interference terms between any pair of decay amplitudes which end in the same final state .",
    "the quantum interference terms appear once the @xmath2 are incorporated . from the inc we know that the @xmath2 are important . in a microscopic scheme",
    "there is a huge amount of possible diagrams which constitute these @xmath2 .",
    "beforehand , we do not known which set of diagrams is the most significant one .",
    "the rpa has been considered as a starting point in this analysis because it simplicity gives us some insight on the kind of the contributions required .",
    "however , the rpa itself does not represent an important contribution .",
    "the comparison of our results with data suggests that the @xmath2 should connect @xmath235 with @xmath234 configurations .",
    "this kind of study is much more complex and it is beyond the scope of the present contribution .    we have payed a particular attention to the non - diagonal interference terms which are important within the rpa . in fact , they are very significant in the @xmath204-spectra , while they can be neglected in @xmath205 . the effect on the @xmath202-spectra is a moderate increase and it is also small for the @xmath203-spectra .",
    "the origin of this behavior does not relays upon any particularity of the rpa , but on some isospin factors .",
    "we agree that only when the relevant @xmath2-diagrams are found and incorporated , we would be able to know if the quantum interference terms are important or not .",
    "but from our results , it is clear that they can not be ignored .",
    "the existing and more successful formalism which takes care of the same problem is the inc .",
    "the inc is a semi - phenomenological approach , where the trajectory of the particles emitted in the weak decay is tracked in their way out of the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath2 are incorporated in the inc using free path and experimental cross sections between nucleons .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to establish a biunique relation between the processes in the inc and in our microscopic model .",
    "the limitation of our microscopic model is the technical difficulty in finding the relevant @xmath2-diagrams .",
    "however , our scheme improves the inc in two main points .",
    "the first one is the incorporation of the quantum interference terms mentioned above .",
    "the second one refers to the description of light hypernuclei , where the employment of the inc is not appropriate .",
    "we have presented our results using nuclear matter together with the lda , which is also a bad approximation for light hypernuclei .",
    "however , our expressions are not limited to nuclear matter and they can be used in a finite nucleus calculation .",
    "the incorporation of @xmath2 in this kind of work is certainly a quite involve task .",
    "our aim is to describe the nuclear spectra of medium hypernuclei where the use of nuclear matter is possible .",
    "however , once this goal is eventually accomplished , the knowledge of the relevant @xmath2-diagrams would encourage the evaluation of a finite nucleus calculation for light hypernuclei .",
    "we would like to comment now on the @xmath236-ratio .",
    "an experimental determination of this ratio suffers from two ambiguities : the possible contribution of two - body induced non mesonic weak decay ( which are originated from ground state correlations , @xmath237 ) and the effect of @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth to mention here that these two processes should not be confused .",
    "the two - body induced , is part of the primary decay as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ nn10]-[npp10 ] ) . after",
    "the primary decay takes place , the strong interaction between nucleons ( i.e. , the @xmath2 ) starts acting .",
    "the @xmath2 affects nucleons from both one- and two - body induced decays .",
    "a final @xmath234-state , for example , can be originated either from a @xmath237 ( without @xmath2 ) or from the action of @xmath2 over a one - body induced decay .",
    "moreover , there is an interference term between these processes , as the initial and final state is the same .",
    "this interference term can not be evaluated within the inc as it is a pure quantum mechanic effects . beyond technical difficulties ,",
    "this kind of contributions are formally part of the @xmath219 in eqs .",
    "( [ nn1f]-[npp1f ] ) .",
    "this is just one example , the theoretical problem of the inclusion of both @xmath237 and @xmath2 , is certainly a very difficult problem .",
    "any experimental determination of the @xmath236-ratio , assumes a model for this theoretical problem .    referring to the inc ,",
    "it is used to predict nucleon spectra and to extract the so - called experimental value for the @xmath236-ratio . for the extraction of the ratio ,",
    "the experimental value for @xmath238 or @xmath239 ( together with the corresponding error bars ) is used as an input . to put it in simple terms , a typical theoretical value for the ratio is , @xmath240 , while data analyzed by means of the inc , gives a result @xmath241 ( we have focused on the @xmath242 region , for @xmath1 ) . based on this analysis ,",
    "it is reasonable to assert that the @xmath236-puzzle has been solved .",
    "however , one should be aware of the fact that the experimental information used as an input in the inc is the @xmath243 ( or @xmath244 ) ratio , where here @xmath39 ( or @xmath201 ) is the integral of the spectra over energy or angle .",
    "clearly , this integration erase some physical information .",
    "in fact , while the inc reproduce fairly well the @xmath202-kinetic energy spectra , some discrepancies remains for the @xmath203-kinetic energy spectra one .",
    "having in mind this element , together with the above mentioned ambiguities , it is our opinion that the real theoretical problem is the reproduction of the spectra . from the present contribution , we have indications that the quantum interference terms should be included in the spectra evaluation .",
    "the next step , is to found the relevant @xmath2-diagrams .",
    "as discussed , the @xmath197-results has given us some hints on this issue .",
    "i would like to thank f. krmpoti , g. garbarino and a. ramos , for fruitful discussions and for the critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the conicet , under contract pip 6159 .",
