    "<S> our focus here is on predictability on time scales of order @xmath39 , where the system is has significant dynamical heterogeneity and the motion is complex and co - operative . for this reason , we have not explored the large - time hydrodynamic behaviour in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we do note that for the hs system , the mi at @xmath39 increases at large @xmath2 , indicating that the coupling of dynamics to local density is increasing as the glass transition is approached , consistent with  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> representative error bars are shown in ( a ) , while in ( b ) we show error bars only at @xmath47.,width=283 ]    an alternative picture of glassy relaxation is based around locally - favoured structures ( lfs ) : atomic or molecular packings that have low energy ( or enthalpy )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particles in lfs typically have slower than average dynamics in glassy systems  @xcite . for both ka and hs models </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an lfs based on a pentagonal bipyramid , identified by the signature 1551 in the analysis of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these structures are indicative of local fivefold symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath56 be the number of pentagonal bipyramids in which particle @xmath6 participates  @xcite : we expect larger @xmath56 to be associated with lower propensity for motion . in the ka model , we also consider an lfs ( bicapped square antiprism ) that has been found to be correlated with slow dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these lfs are associated with voronoi polyhedra whose signature is @xmath57 in the notation of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath58 if particle @xmath6 participates in such an lfs , with @xmath59 otherwise . for the ka model , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath60 and @xmath61 using the inherent structure of the system .    figure  [ fig : mi - lfs](a ) shows results for the ka model , indicating that @xmath60 and @xmath62 are correlated with particle motion  @xcite . as with the low - frequency normal modes , the signal is largest on time scales @xmath63 indicative of @xmath64-relaxation , but there is still some correlation at the structural relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strength of the correlation is smaller for the lfs than for the normal modes , less than 0.1 bit in all cases . figure  [ fig : mi - lfs](b ) shows similar results for the hs system . </S>",
    "<S> the mi values are larger than those of the ka system , indicating that lfs have more predictive power for dynamics . at short times </S>",
    "<S> , the mi increases with increasing volume fraction ; however the mi at @xmath39 ( indicated by the error bars ) depends more weakly on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the small mi values at @xmath39 and longer times , and the absence of an increase of the values at @xmath39 with volume fraction , both indicate that the lfs identified here are more weakly coupled to the dynamics than the normal modes , at least for the degree of supercooling accessed here .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize our findings so far , figure  [ fig : mi - modes - hydro ] shows that debye - waller factors and coarse - grained measurements of energy and density have significant coupling to dynamics , providing predictive information comparable with measurements of particle type in the ka model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the information available from the different measurements has very different time - dependences . for short times </S>",
    "<S> , the normal mode analysis captures fast vibrational motion accurately , but the predictive power of this analysis decreases strongly with time . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that as structural relaxation starts to take place , the ` soft directions ' for further relaxation quickly diverge from those that were present at @xmath13 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> coarse - grained energy and density measurements have almost no predictive value at short times , but the slow decay of large - scale hydrodynamic fluctuations means that they can influence particle dynamics quite strongly even on time scales much longer than @xmath39 : on these time scales , almost all memory of the initial structure has been lost , leaving only the hydrodynamic fluctuations in energy or density . for the state points considered here , figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mi - lfs ] shows that lfs measurements have less predictive power for dynamics in these models , and that this predictive power is largest on relatively short time scales associated with @xmath64-relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretation is that since the lifetimes of most lfs are less than @xmath39  @xcite , the influence of lfs on dynamics is ( in most cases ) similarly short - lived , limiting the predictive power of such measurements for dynamics .    . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]    finally , in contrast to the measurements so far , we show how information theory can also be used to analyze how predictable particle motion is in these models , independent of any specific structural observable . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath67 be the ( isoconfigurational ) distribution of particle displacements @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> given data for @xmath69 particles ( which may be obtained in general from many initial configurations ) , we define @xmath70 which is the `` average amount of information about a particle s motion that is provided by specifying its initial environment '' . since a particle s initial environment encodes all predictable aspects of its future motion , @xmath71 indicates how predictable ( or reproducible ) particle motion is within the system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : mi - dyn ] shows that @xmath71 is much larger at low temperatures in the ka model than at high temperatures , indicating that structure is more strongly coupled to dynamics at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to compare @xmath71 with `` the average amount of information about a particle s dynamics that is provided by specifying its propensity '' , which is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the joint distribution of displacement @xmath74 and propensity @xmath17 , and @xmath75 is the marginal distribution of the displacement . </S>",
    "<S> since fixing a particle s initial environment necessarily fixes its propensity , one has @xmath76 from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mi - dyn ] , the two quantities in ( [ equ : mu - i ] ) are almost equal for the ka model . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : mu - i ] ) is an `` information - processing inequality ''  @xcite , so this result indicates that the propensity captures almost all predictable information about single - particle displacements . for the hs system , we use a conditional mi between @xmath74 and @xmath17 , to account for particle type , as above . </S>",
    "<S> the two mis in ( [ equ : mu - i ] ) differ somewhat more strongly than they do in the ka model : this situation might arise ( for example ) if some particles have finite average displacements @xmath77 that are only weakly correlated with their propensities .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we have @xmath78 in both models , indicating that the propensity captures all predictable ( reproducible ) aspects of the single - particle dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this further validates the use of the mutual information as a general figure - of - merit for evaluating proposed connections between structure and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> given the implications of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mi - modes - hydro ] and  [ fig : mi - lfs ] for the strength and time - dependence of the coupling between structure and dynamics , we hope that future studies will exploit these information - theoretic measurements to further elucidate which ( if any ) structural features are responsible for the strong dynamical slowing in supercooled liquids .    </S>",
