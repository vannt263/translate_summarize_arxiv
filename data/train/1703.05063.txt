    "the study of correlations in interacting physical systems is a vital field of research .",
    "especially , upcoming quantum technologies urge a redefinition of the notion of correlations to discern classical phenomena from quantum effects .",
    "this becomes particularly important when quantum systems are joined to form a composite system @xcite .",
    "for instance , the concept of quantum entanglement , which was described in the seminal work by einstein , podolski , and rosen @xcite , emerges from the compound and nonlocal description of at least two quantum particles @xcite .",
    "starting from the prominent paradox of schrdinger s cat @xcite , quantum superpositions  in combination with quantum measurements  have been established to be the origin of general quantum correlations which have no counterpart in classical physics . superimposed quantum states",
    "explain why quantum systems have the potential to exhibit nonclassical features which can not be described through classical statistical correlations .",
    "consequently , quantum correlations can be applied to implement quantum communication and information protocols @xcite .    in order to study nonclassical correlations ,",
    "a proper concept of a classical state of a quantum system needs to be defined .",
    "given the richness of possible physical systems , it is no surprise that various notions of classicality have been established , each of which has a classical analogue in the scenario under study , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "for example , coherent states of a quantized radiation field represent the best approximation to a classical electromagnetic wave @xcite .",
    "therefore , the glauber - sudarshan representation of quantum states of light in terms of such coherent states is the fundamental benchmark to probe nonclassical properties in optical systems @xcite . with respect to this notion , the photon  the quantum particle of an electromagnetic wave @xcite  is clearly a nonclassical state of a light field which can be described as a superposition of coherent states .",
    "another example of a nonclassical state stems from the field of quantum information .",
    "the qubit ( quantum bit ) introduces the concept of a quantum superposition of classical truth values `` true '' and `` false '' @xcite .",
    "these superpositions have been shown to lead to a vast number of quantum computation and communication protocols which can not be implemented using classical information theory @xcite .",
    "examples are quantum key distribution @xcite or dense coding @xcite , but also no - go theorems , such as the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "in particular , quantum communication _ per se _ requires the interaction of at least two subsystems .",
    "hence , the concept of nonclassicality has to be generalized to be applicable to compound physical systems .",
    "the phenomenon of quantum entanglement is one universally accepted type of a nonclassical correlation between multiple degrees of freedom @xcite . especially in highly multipartite systems , the entanglement between individual or ensembles of particles can become rather complex @xcite as the relations between the different constituents can exhibit different levels of correlations ranging from uncorrelated over classically correlated to quantum correlated , _",
    "i.e. _ entangled in the present case .",
    "the most prominent example for nonequivalent classes of multipartite entanglement is certainly the difference of three qubits in the ghz or w configuration @xcite , see also @xcite for a generalization .",
    "however , the detection of entanglement is already challenging when restricting to a bipartite scenario and , consequently , a number of different entanglement tests have been proposed and implemented to uncover such nonclassical correlations , see @xcite for overviews .",
    "another application of quantum correlations is the remote state preparation which is partly connected to the phenomena of quantum steering @xcite and often used when producing ( nonclassical ) single photons from photon - pair sources via heralding @xcite .",
    "the underlying conditional realization of quantum states can be a result of entanglement , but it can be also achieved with other nonclassical correlations @xcite . therefore , various other concepts of quantum correlations have been exploited @xcite .",
    "for example , the resources needed for the generation of single photons can be completely classified and implemented in terms of nonclassical photon - photon correlations between two separable ( _ i.e. _ disentangled ) radiation fields using the glauber - sudarshan representation for harmonic oscillators @xcite . yet ,",
    "the urgent question how to treat quantum correlations that arise from distinct notions of nonclassicality of specific physical subsystems  adhered to different concepts of nonclassicality  has not been frequently addressed in the existing literature .    in this work ,",
    "we study quantum correlations that emerge in composite quantum systems consisting of parts with diverse notions of nonclassicality .",
    "in particular , we consider a composed system that consists of a harmonic oscillator and a qubit .",
    "the notion of nonclassical correlation in the resulting bipartite scenario is defined on the basis of the quantumness of the individual parts .",
    "examples of resulting hybrid states highlight the impact of local and global quantum superpositions on the nonclassicality in the bipartite system .",
    "the implications of joint and conditional quantum correlations are compared .",
    "finally , the entanglement of the system under study is discussed and the generalization to multimode systems and to capture temporal correlations is outlined .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the studied concept of quantum correlations is defined in section [ sec : quantcorr ] .",
    "different forms of quantum statistical correlations are considered and compared in section [ sec : condjoint ] . in section [ sec : ent ] , we specifically investigate entanglement and we comment on possible extensions of our approach . we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "suppose we have two hilbert spaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 which describe the two physical subsystems of the compound space @xmath2 .",
    "further on , we have two subsets , @xmath3 for @xmath4 , that consist of pure states which are considered to have classical properties .",
    "the particular definition of a classical state @xmath5 has to be specified and some distinct examples will be given later on .",
    "a classical pure state in the composite system is an uncorrelated state as superpositions would lead to nonclassical / quantum interferences .",
    "thus , @xmath6 defines the set of classical bipartite states .",
    "note that we always assume that states are properly normalized .",
    "in addition , we indicate the relation to the first and second subsystem as well as the composite system with the superscripts @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , throughout this work .",
    "a quantum system that is subjected to an interaction with an environment , or when it is exposed to other imperfections , is not in a pure state .",
    "rather , it is a statistical mixture of states .",
    "hence , the notion of classical states can be extended to mixed ones .",
    "that is , any classical mixing of classical pure states yields a ( mixed ) classical state , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary classical probability distribution over the set @xmath12 .",
    "whenever the quantum state of a bipartite system can not be written in this form , we speak about nonclassical ( or quantum ) correlations  in contrast to the nonclassicality of the individual subsystems .    typically ( but not necessarily ) , nonclassical correlations are related to entanglement .",
    "any pure entangled state , decomposed as @xmath13 with linearly independent @xmath14 , is obviously not a product state .",
    "therefore , it is not in the set of pure classical states @xmath12 .",
    "this holds analogously for mixed entangled states .",
    "however , we will also discuss nonclassical correlations between the subsystems that are independent of entanglement .    in the following ,",
    "we perform a detailed study of the introduced concept for some examples .",
    "we demonstrate that the quantum superposition principle is the source for nonclassicality within and between the subsystems .",
    "it is also shown that one can have compound nonclassical states which , however , are classical in their subsystems .      the fundamental notion of nonclassicality in a system of a harmonic oscillator ( representing , for example , one optical mode ) is given in terms of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath15 representation of a state @xcite , @xmath16 in fact , this decomposition is possible for any state via a quasiprobability density @xmath17 .",
    "the state @xmath18 is classical if and only if @xmath17 can be interpreted in terms of classical probability theory @xcite , @xmath19 .",
    "if this is not possible , the state refers to as a nonclassical one .",
    "this means that @xmath17 is not positive semi - definite in the sense of distributions .",
    "in general , nonorthogonal coherent states are the classical and pure states in this system @xcite , @xmath20 . for example , the pure coherent states @xmath21 are classical , whereas the superposition @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the normalization constant ) is a nonclassical superposition state .",
    "independent of the specific quantum characteristics of the state @xmath18 , the @xmath15 function is a real - valued ( @xmath24 ) and normalized ( @xmath25 ) distribution .",
    "however , the @xmath15 function is highly singular for many quantum states , such as fock states and squeezed states @xcite .",
    "consequently , a regularization procedure  known as filtering  has been introduced to verify the nonclassicality through a regular quasiprobability @xmath26 @xcite , which is given by the convolution @xmath27 the specific requirements on @xmath28more precisely on its fourier transform @xmath29have been elaborated in @xcite to guarantee an unambiguous verification of any type of nonclassicality in systems of harmonic oscillators .",
    "one example of a properly defined filter is the function @xmath30)}{w\\mathrm{re}[\\alpha]}\\right]^2\\left[\\frac{\\sin(w\\mathrm{im}[\\alpha])}{w\\mathrm{im}[\\alpha]}\\right]^2 ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which includes the width parameter @xmath31 .",
    "more general classes of filters can be additionally found in @xcite .",
    "this regularization approach has been used , for example , to experimentally uncover the negative quasiprobability of a squeezed state @xcite , which would be impossible with the frequently applied wigner function .",
    "even an experimental quantum - process characterization has been performed based on this filtering technique @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the harmonic oscillator , the classical states of a qubit system ( orthonormal basis @xmath32 ) are defined through the ability to decompose the quantum state in the diagonal form @xmath33 this means , the state is in a classical statistical mixture of the classical truth values @xmath34 ( `` false '' ) and @xmath35 ( `` true '' ) , which are realized with the probabilities @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "this also implies that @xmath38 .",
    "the state @xmath39 is nonclassical if the decomposition is impossible , _",
    "i.e. _ off - diagonal contributions @xmath40 are required to describe the qubit under study .",
    "for example , the state @xmath41 is nonclassical as it superimposes the classical states for `` true '' and `` false '' , which exceeds the limitations of a classical and probabilistic boolean logic system .",
    "the quantification of the quantumness in a multi - qubit system has been done in @xcite as a special example for a general quantification approach using quantum superpositions . moreover",
    ", this concept of nonclassicality is typically discussed in the context of quantum coherence for a more general @xmath42-level system ( qudit ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , a quantitative relation between the amount of quantum coherence and entanglement has been found @xcite .      in our scenario ,",
    "the composition @xmath43 defines the set of classical states of the compound bipartite system .",
    "since the first system is described in terms of continuous variables and the second one in terms of a discrete variable , such a joint system is called a hybrid system . the combined notion of nonclassical correlations",
    "allows us to study the origins of different forms of quantum properties .",
    "using the previously studied expansions , any hybrid quantum state can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 . therefore ,",
    "the combined notion of a mixed classical state implies that @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 has to hold for any classical hybrid state . for convenience",
    ", we can define a @xmath15 matrix , @xmath49 , to describe the compound system and for generalizing the glauber - sudarshan @xmath15 distribution .",
    "this @xmath15 matrix can be filtered as shown for the single - mode case in equation .",
    "this concept was introduced in @xcite .    before exploiting this joint description in more detail , it is important to stress a major difference in the notion of classical qubits to the case of the glauber - sudarshan representation . because of @xmath50 for nonclassical qubit states ,",
    "the decomposition is not possible for them even if one would allow for negative or complex quasiprobabilities @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in contrast the expansion in applies to all quantum states of an harmonic oscillator . in general , any system with pure , classical reference states could include the following types of nonclassical states :    * states that can be represented in terms of pseudo - mixtures of pure states ( _ e.g. _ nonclassical states of the harmonic oscillator ) and * states that can not be represented in terms of such a diagonal - representation of classical states ( _ e.g. _ nonclassical qubit states ) .",
    "this means that for nonclassical states of the form ( i ) , a quasiprobability representation in terms of classical states exists which is impossible for quantum states of the type ( ii ) .",
    "let us consider some first elementary examples of bipartite nonclassical states to highlight different forms of quantumness , @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the state @xmath55 is solely nonclassical with respect to the first subsystem and it corresponds to the case of nonclassicality ( i ) .",
    "that is , its density operator @xmath56 is described with a @xmath15 matrix whose elements are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "hence , @xmath55 has no classical harmonic oscillator analogue .",
    "an example for the type of nonclassicality of the case ( ii ) is the state @xmath59 .",
    "it only shows nonclassicality in the second , qubit subsystem and has a non - vanishing off - diagonal contribution in the @xmath15 matrix , @xmath60 ( note , @xmath61 for this state ) .",
    "so far , we solely considered the local superposition states .",
    "finally , the state @xmath62 in equation is entangled and , therefore , shows nonclassical correlations between the two components of the hybrid system .",
    "this is of some importance , because its single - mode reduced states are classical mixtures of pure classical states in their respective subsystems .",
    "that is , we have for the second subsystem @xmath63 , in the limit @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for the first subsystem .",
    "the entanglement of @xmath62being the present form of nonclassical correlations  is a result of the global superposition of the two classical hybrid states @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the role of the superpositions for entanglement has been also experimentally determined in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that combinations of the quantum superposition principle on the local and global level can be also used to get intermediate levels of nonclassicality . those combine nonclassicality in the individual subsystems and nonclassical correlations , for example , @xmath69\\otimes[|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle]+[|\\alpha\\rangle+\\rmi|{-}\\alpha\\rangle]\\otimes[|0\\rangle+\\rmi|1\\rangle])$ ] .      as a generalization of a previous example , we study a family schrdinger cat states @xcite , @xmath70 which is particularly parametrized through the phase @xmath71 between the classical terms . here , we restrict ourselves to real - valued and non - negative coherent amplitudes , @xmath72 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that relations between phase - dependent properties and entanglement of similar states have been studied in the presence of imperfections , such as fluctuating losses , in @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the phase can be subjected to a randomization according to a @xmath73-periodic gaussian distribution with a variance @xmath74 .",
    "this results in the mixed state @xmath75 with the real - valued and non - negative parameter @xmath76 note that non - gaussian phase randomizations could be considered in a similar manner . as we will show in this work , the quantum properties of this state are determined through the parameter @xmath77 . especially from the bounds",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 , we can already observe that the former yields the pure superposition state , for @xmath80 , and the latter results in the classical mixture @xmath81    let us give the @xmath15 matrix representation for the state .",
    "for this reason , we recall that a coherent state can be written in the form @xmath82 @xcite , where @xmath83 is the bosonic creation operator . using additionally @xmath84 ,",

    "the maximal expectation value for separable state ( solid , blue line labeled as @xmath166 ) is violated for no dephasing ( dotted , green curve ) and for @xmath186 in case of the partial dephasing ( dot - dashed , orange curve ) . in case of higher phase noise ( dashed , violet curve ) , no entanglement can be detected with the observable @xmath161 under study . ]      a generalization of our approach to multimode systems is straightforward . for the @xmath187-partite scenario , we consider the sets @xmath160 of pure classical states for @xmath188 .",
    "the compound set of classical states is consequently defined as @xmath189 especially , all states in @xmath190 are fully separable . using the convex hull of multipartite classical pure states as it was done in the bipartite case ,",
    "we can extend the notion of classically correlated , multipartite states to mixed ones .",
    "thus , we also constructed a concept of multipartite quantum correlations from the @xmath187 local definitions of classical states @xmath160 .",
    "as two examples , let us mention the tripartite quantum correlated states .",
    "they are @xmath191 and @xmath192 with linearly independent @xmath193 for @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the state @xmath55 corresponds to a ghz state and @xmath59 resembles a w state which represent inequivalent classes of full entanglement @xcite .",
    "in addition , a partially entangled ( or partially separable ) state is @xmath196 $ ] .    as done for the bipartite case",
    ", we could now characterize the quantum correlations in more detail for such states , which would also require to specify the sets @xmath160 .",
    "moreover , the quantification of the resulting nonclassical correlations can be performed as introduced in general in @xcite . there , the importance of quantum superpositions for constructing universal quantumness measures was also highlighted .",
    "much more sophisticated is a generalization to include multitime correlations .",
    "for example , already the construction of multitime density operators is a complex problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , the question of temporal correlations can be closely related to a time evolution that has no counterpart in classical physics @xcite . for mixed states",
    "this would mean that a description of a multitime system in terms of a stochastic process can not be done . in a simplified manner",
    ", one could argue that the assumption of locality ( or of local - hidden - variables ) in the einstein - podolski - rosen paradox @xcite is replaced with the assumption of ( classical ) causality .    as mentioned above",
    ", the time evolution of the system plays an important role for defining nonclassical temporal correlations .",
    "in particular , time - dependent hamilton operators require a so - called time - ordering when formulating the solution of the equations of motion ( _ e.g. _ schrdinger or heisenberg equation ) .",
    "this is needed to define a proper unitary time evolution operator and it can have a major influence on the evolution of a system @xcite .    a concept of quantumness for which the multitime generalization has been successfully done is the harmonic oscillator system @xcite . in this a system ,",
    "the space - time dependent quantum correlations can be uncovered based on a @xmath15 functional which generalizes the glauber - sudarshan function by including time - ordering effects .",
    "one example of its application is the interpretation of the prominent photon antibunching experiment @xcite .",
    "that is , the inability to interpret the @xmath15 functional , which describes the emission of photons , in terms of classical stochastic process .",
    "recently , we have been also able to formulate a regularization approach to filter the @xmath15 functional @xcite .",
    "as the time - ordering could introduce arbitrary singularities to this functional , the correspond regularization has to be done with great care .    in the future",
    ", it would be important to generalize the approach for temporal quantum correlations in harmonic oscillator systems to other systems and notions of nonclassicality .",
    "from such a technique , our method to construct multipartite quantum correlations from local ones could be generalized by including time - ordering effects to define multitime quantum correlations .",
    "eventually , this could also result in a definition of temporal entanglement as the emerging quantum correlation that exists for any individual notion of nonclassicality .",
    "however , this requires further research .",
    "we analyzed quantum correlations in composite quantum systems .",
    "especially , a bipartite state was defined and analytically characterized by combining one continuous - variable harmonic oscillator and one discrete - variable qubit subsystem .",
    "we could combine the seemingly incompatible concepts of nonclassicality of the individual parts and establish the concept of nonclassical correlations between the different degrees of freedom .",
    "this was achieved by requiring that a classically correlated system can be described in terms of uncorrelated , pure state and classical statistical mixing only .",
    "some examples of pure nonclassical states have been studied .",
    "we showed the distinct differences of local and global quantum superpositions .",
    "the local superposition of classical states resulted in the nonclassicality of the subsystems , whereas globally superimposed states introduced nonclassical correlations between the two parts .",
    "a quantum state representation of the hybrid system under study was discussed and the classical states in this representation have been identified .",
    "this was based on a matrix quasiprobability distribution .",
    "we could distinguish between two classes of nonclassical states .",
    "those are stares which can be written as pseudo - mixtures of classical ones and those which can not be expanded in such a form at all . moreover ,",
    "a regularization approach was considered to resolve singularities within the matrix quasiprobability .    restricting ourselves to specific observables , we analyzed nonclassical correlations in connection to the joint and conditional probability distributions of the measurement outcomes .",
    "it was demonstrated that joint and conditional variances of the same observable and the same state state can be sensitive to different forms of nonclassicality .",
    "let us emphasize that the conditional nonclassical correlations are connected to the remote manipulation of one subsystem by performing a measurement on the other .",
    "finally , we also addressed more general forms of nonclassical correlations .",
    "we argued that entanglement is a quantum correlation which has some form of universal character .",
    "in general , entanglement emerges as one kind of quantum correlations among others . yet",
    ", the remarkable fact is that it always emerges , which highlights the general importance of entanglement .",
    "we also outlined the generalization of our techniques to multipartite systems that consists of an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and the possibility to include temporal correlations .",
