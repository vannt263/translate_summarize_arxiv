    "it is necessary to classify the discovered multiple planetary systems according to their statistical characteristics ( such as planet masses , semi - major axes , eccentricities and metallicity ) ( marcy et al .",

    "2003;also see figure 1a - b ) and to study the correlation between mass ratio and period ratio ( mazeh & zucker 2003 ) . and the other important point is to investigate the possible stable configurations for the multiple systems , especially for the couples in the mean motion resonance .",

    "fischer d.a .",
    "( private communication ) pointed out that more than half of the solar - like stars with one detected planet show velocity trends indicating the presence of a second or multiple planets .",
    "thus , we turn to the interesting topic of studying the stable geometry for two planets locking into a resonance .",
    "and our investigations are helpful in an understanding of the dynamics and possible mechanisms of sustaining the stability of such systems . in table 1",
    "are listed the orbital parameters of hd 82943 , gj 876 and 55 cnc .",
    "another important feature for the resonant systems is the apsidal lock between the orbiting companions , indicating that the relative apsidal longitudes of two orbits librate about a constant , such that two planets have common time - averaged rate of apsidal precession ( kinoshita & nakai 2000 ; chiang & murray 2002 ; malhotra 2002 ) .",
    "the critical argument @xmath5 , @xmath6 for the 2:1 mmr is @xmath7 @xmath8    and the relative apsidal longitude is @xmath9 where @xmath10 are , respectively , the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planets , and @xmath11 , respectively , denote their periastron longitudes .",
    "there are three possible stable configurations for a system in a 2:1 mmr : ( i ) only @xmath5 librates about @xmath2 ; ( ii)case of alignment , @xmath12 ; ( iii)case of antialignment , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the simulation results show that hd 82943 could occupy the above three stable configurations , while gj 876 does classes i and ii .",
    "figure 2a displays an antialignment case for hd 82943 .",
    "the librations of the relative apsidal longitudes and mean motion resonant variables about 0 or 180 degrees show that two important dynamical factors to characterize the multiple planetary systems .    as for hd 82943",
    ", we established a semi - analytical model on the averaged hamiltonian ( ji et al .",
    "2003b ; also see figure 2b ) to explore the apsidal motion for this system and found that although the two planets have high eccentricities to 0.54 and 0.41 , the system remain stable for 10 myr because of both dynamical mechanisms of the 2:1 mmr and apsidal lock .",
    "this is also true for the hd 160691 system ( see bois et al . 2003 , where the stable configuration is involved in a 2:1 mean motion resonance with an anti - aligned in two apsidal lines , with higher eccentricity of the outer planet ) .",
    "the work of ji et al.(2003a ) confirmed that the inner two companions of 55 cnc ( marcy et al .",
    "2002 ) are in a 3:1 resonance and still experience the apsidal phase - locking .",
    "two characterized arguments for resonances are : @xmath16 where @xmath10 are , respectively , the mean longitudes of 55 cnc b and 55 cnc c , and @xmath11 , individually , denote their apsidal longitudes . in figure 3a , @xmath5 librate about @xmath17 for million years .",
    "the relative apsidal longitude of @xmath18 walks about @xmath19 , which indicates that there exists an asymmetric apsidal libration between two inner planets . here",
    "two dynamical mechanisms are responsible for the stability of the 55 cnc system . in addition",
    ", the numerical results further show that a wider stable region between 55 cnc c and 55 cnc d , implying an earth - like planet may survive ( see  3 ) in the triple - planet system .",
    "do the terrestrial planets exist in the habitable zones ( kasting , whitmore , & reynolds 1993 ) for the multiple systems ?",
    "is there possibly a stable liquid water environment for other civilizations ? with the means of the direct integrations , we performed many tests in 55 cnc by placing an earth - mass planet at @xmath20 au with low eccentricity and found that such orbits can survive for 10 myr or even longer ( figure 3b ) and there are wider stable zones for this system . and",
    "the stable orbits can be still reserved even when we gradually increased the mass of the assumed planet .",
    "similar cases occur in the system of gj 876 ( ji et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and other exosystems , especially for the host star that harbors two well - separated planets .",
    "although the present ground - based observations set limitations on the discovery of the earth - like planets , space interferometer mission ( sim ) may detect our earth twins in the future task .    due to the limited numbers of the exosystems involved in low mean motion resonance at this stage ,",
    "thus it is too early to conclude that the planets tend to be captured into the resonance in the early planetary formation .",
    "however , the resonant geometry may become a suitable dynamical environment related to the stability of these systems , and future more observations on the exosystems will elucidate more clues on this ."
