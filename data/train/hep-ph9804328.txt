    "the top quark production in the qcd pair channel has been established by d and cdf collaborations at tevatron in 1995@xcite .",
    "the cross section of electroweak process of single top quark production is comparable with production ( see refs .",
    "8 - 21 in @xcite ) .",
    "single top production diagrams directly include coupling , in contrast to channel .",
    "therefore , single top production provides a unique opportunity to study the structure and to measure .",
    "top quark is heavy and single top quark study could also be promising in looking for deviations from the standard model ( sm ) . despite the cross section of single top quark is of order of @xmath5 the task of the background reduction is much more serious problem then that in the case .",
    "that is why we concentrated here on the possibility to extract the signal of single top quark from various backgrounds .",
    "the top quark decays into @xmath6  boson and @xmath7  quark .",
    "we consider here only subsequent leptonic decays of the @xmath8 to positron ( muon ) and neutrino , as this signal must be easier to find experimentally than channels with hadronic decays of @xmath8-boson .",
    "we concentrated on the following processes of single top quark production : 1 .",
    "@xmath9 ( w - gluon fusion ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath10 , 3 .",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is a light quark and @xmath13 stands for remnants of the proton and antiproton .",
    "feynman diagrams for the above processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ diag - st ] .",
    "we refer to the paper @xcite for details .",
    "all analytical and almost all numerical calculations have been done by means of comphep package  @xcite .",
    "fortran codes of matrix elements generated by comphep have been used in mc generators implemented as external processes of pythia program . for t - quark production",
    "we chose @xmath14 scale equal to top mass squared .",
    "for a @xmath15 top quark the total single top plus anti - top cross section is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the upper and lower bounds come from the difference between calculations using two parton distributions with the errors caused by the choice of qcd scale .",
    "the final state signature of signal for leptonic decay of w is @xmath18 where one of the jets is b quark from top .",
    "the main backgrounds leading to the same final state signature as in case of single top productions are : @xmath19 ( gluonic , @xmath20 order and electroweak @xmath21 order ) and qcd ( @xmath22 ) background when one of the jets imitates electron .",
    "all numbers both for signal and background are presented below with the initial general cuts on jets : @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . for @xmath26 background @xmath27 has been taken .",
    "for calculation of and processes we choose invariant mass for @xmath14 scale .",
    "total cross section of @xmath28 ( ) `` gluonic '' background ( @xmath29 ) is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the signal .",
    "the specific feature of single top production is highly energetic @xmath7 quark in the final state and one additional @xmath7 quark for w - gluon fusion process .",
    "the @xmath7 quark content of the processes is small ( less then 1% ) and efficient b - tagging gives us chance to extract the signal from overwhelming background .",
    "we assume 50% b - tagging efficiency hereafter .",
    "for initial cuts mentioned above the total cross section for @xmath30 process ( gluon splitting ) is @xmath31 .",
    "contribution from background due to @xmath7 quark misidentification should also be taken into account . in our study",
    "we chose 1% misidentification probability .",
    "complete set of feynman diagrams for background is shown in fig .  [ back1 ] .    the main contribution to",
    "the background comes from processes a and b with @xmath32 splitting .",
    "diagrams with virtual photon and z boson ( c , d and e ) give small contribution to the total cross section ( for virtual photon less than 1% ) due to presence of additional electromagnetic constant , while contribution from @xmath33 can be removed by imposing cut on the invariant mass .",
    "process f with higgs production contributes also less than 1% ( @xmath34 ) of the total background .",
    "diagrams g and h are negligible due to small value of the ckm elements .",
    "another important irreducible background comes from multi - jet qcd processes when jet is misidentified as an electron .",
    "though the probability of that is small ( of order of 0.01% ) the cross section for such processes is large and gives essential contribution to the background for single top production .",
    "we have calculated total cross sections and made mc simulations for and processes which are relevant for the considered signature if one light jet imitates an electron .",
    "table  [ tab - jbb ] summarizes all subprocesses giving and final state signatures and their cross sections .",
    "total cross sections for and are 204105 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    ".[tab - jbb ] @xmath36 and @xmath37 cross sections .",
    "processes [ cols= \" < , > , < , > \" , ]     the number of events corresponding to signal and background after the cuts application is presented in table  [ higgs - t ] . requiring 3-standard deviation criteria one can find higgs up to the mass @xmath38 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "these numbers are obtained under assumption of @xmath42 efficiency of double b - tagging .",
    "one can see that with the decreasing higgs boson mass the contribution of the single top processes to the total background becomes more significant .",
    "it should be noted also that @xmath43 background increases approximately two times with the increasing of @xmath44 from 2 to @xmath45 as well as @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) signal . at the same time",
    "@xmath48 cross section becomes about 3 - 4 times higher because the @xmath49 subprocess contribution grows about 6 times .",
    "that is why increasing of the collider energy from 2 to @xmath45 extends higgs mass interval only up to @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "[ higgs - bb ] we demonstrate the effective -invariant mass distribution for the cases @xmath50 , @xmath39 without any cuts and with cuts applied revealing clear peak from higgs boson .",
    "study of single top quark and higgs boson production at the upgraded tevatron is not only important but also convenient since they have very similar signatures .",
    "it was shown that the signal from the single top quark can be extracted and therefore vertex and ckm parameter at the upgraded tevatron can be measured .",
    "the main backgrounds have been studied : , , @xmath22 and the set of kinematical cuts on @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , di - jet mass and @xmath54 variables has been worked out leading to the signal - to - background ratio @xmath55 .",
    "analysis of the 4-fermion final state reactions for higgs boson signal and it s background ( @xmath33 , @xmath56 , gluonic background , @xmath57 and single top quark ) shows the possibility to find the last unobserved sm particle up to the mass @xmath0 at @xmath1 and up to about @xmath2 at @xmath3 .    * acknowledgments*. one of us ( a.b . ) is grateful to the organizing committee for warm hospitality and financial support.the financial support of the russian foundation for basic research is acknowledged .",
