    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are the most massive galaxies known in the universe and are observed to have remarkably small dispersion in their absolute magnitudes compared to other early - type cluster galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their position at the centre of clusters suggests their evolution and their unique properties are linked to their special environment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is still not clear exactly which processes drive their evolution .    of central importance in this context is the mass assembly history of these most massive galaxies and how that depends on their environment .",
    "semi - analytic models based on merger trees from the millennium n - body simulation predict that , while the stars in bcgs form at high - redshift , the mass of the galaxy only assembles recently ( doubling in mass since @xmath7 ; @xcite ) , with the most massive galaxies in the most massive clusters having undergone the most mass assembly . observations of bcgs agree that their properties are consistent with having undergone mergers ( e.g. @xcite ) and bcgs in the most massive clusters do appear to have undergone more stellar mass evolution than those in less massive clusters , as shown by their surface brightness profiles @xcite . however ,",
    "that evolution must have predominantly occurred before @xmath7 as shown by the uniformity in their absolute magnitudes @xcite , and their steep metallicity gradients @xcite .    an important clue in this context lies in the central galaxy luminosity  host - halo mass ( l@xmath8m@xmath9 ) relation , which shows a scaling between bcg mass and that of its host halo . @xcite found that @xmath10 for 93 bcgs at @xmath0 , @xcite found @xmath11 for 217 bcgs at @xmath12 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and @xcite found @xmath13 for the sdss maxbcg cluster sample ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "studies of the l@xmath8m@xmath9-relation have not ventured beyond @xmath15 , so it is not clear whether this relationship evolves with cosmic time .",
    "the l@xmath8m@xmath9-relation is also a natural output from analyses of cosmological simulations : halo occupation distribution functions ( hod ; e.g. @xcite ) and conditional luminosity functions ( clf ; e.g. cooray & milosavljevi 2005 ; henceforth cm05 ) .",
    "these statistically assign numbers of galaxies or the luminosity distribution of galaxies in a given dark matter halo , distinguishing between central and satellite galaxies and enabling a direct comparison with observations .",
    "a related approach is the application of a direct relationship between the mass of a dark matter halo or sub - halo and the observed galaxy luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ; henceforth vo06 , vo07 ) .",
    "cm05 predict @xmath16 above halo masses of @xmath17 as the timescale on which dynamical friction causes satellite galaxies to fall in to the centre exceeds the age of the host system halo . vo06",
    "predict @xmath18 as a result of the hierarchical formation of structure in the universe , with a prescription for sub - halo mass loss .",
    "we interpret the l@xmath19m@xmath9-relation in this paradigm : that it results from the bcg growing in step with its host halo .",
    "@xcite analysed the hod of galaxy groups in the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( @xmath20 ) and found @xmath21 .",
    "more recently , @xcite determined the clf of groups ( @xmath20 ) in the sdss and found @xmath22 . at higher redshifts , @xcite analysed the hod using the two - point correlation function of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( @xmath23 ) in comparison to the sdss ( @xmath24 ) and determined the l@xmath8m@xmath9-relation and its evolution .",
    "they found the vo06 model to be a good fit to their data at @xmath25 and @xmath7 suggesting that this relationship has not evolved .",
    "@xcite found @xmath26 at @xmath27 from their hod analysis of @xmath28 red galaxies in the noao deep wide field survey .",
    "these studies , however , do not directly identify central galaxies .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the central - galaxy luminosity  host halo mass relation for a sample of known bcgs in groups and clusters at @xmath0 and , for the first time , the relationship for known bcgs in clusters at redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "this will enable us to directly determine the evolution in this relationship for known bcgs and to compare to the hod analyses at these redshifts .",
    "it will also enable us to examine the @xcite prediction of these galaxies having doubled in mass since @xmath7 .",
    "in section  [ data ] we introduce our sample and then present our comparison of bgg and bcg luminosities with host system mass in section  [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section  [ discussion ] and draw our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath29 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the bcg sample is from @xcite and contains 92 bcgs at @xmath33 and 63 at @xmath34 .",
    "these are selected as the brightest galaxies closest to the x - ray centroid of their host cluster and are all early - type galaxies .    in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath35-band magnitudes were measured in an aperture of radius @xmath36 kpc .",
    "the apparent magnitudes were corrected to absolute magnitudes using k- and passive evolution corrections @xcite produced by the gissel96 stellar population synthesis code @xcite .",
    "the galaxies were assumed to be 10gyrs old , to have formed in an instantaneous burst , and to have evolved passively since @xmath37 .",
    "the assumptions of age and redshift of formation have negligible effect on the correction value .",
    "the magnitudes were also corrected for galactic absorption ( typical values @xmath38 mag ) using the maps of @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in these magnitudes are @xmath39 mag .",
    "cluster x - ray luminosity is directly proportional to the square of the electron density of the intra - cluster medium and provides a measure of the host system mass .",
    "x - ray luminosities for the low - redshift clusters were measured from the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) , paired with co - ordinates from abell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for the high - redshift clusters were obtained from the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; @xcite ) and serendipitous high - redshift archival cluster _",
    "catalogues @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the rass passband ( @xmath40 kev ) data were transformed to the emss passband ( @xmath41 kev ) .",
    "here we use the same transformation to place all these values in the rass passband , i.e. @xmath42 kev)@xmath43 kev)@xmath44 .",
    "the host clusters cover a wide range in x - ray luminosity : @xmath45 ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath47 at redshifts @xmath0 and @xmath48 ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath47 at redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "the group evolution multiwavelength survey ( gems ; @xcite ) is a heterogeneous sample of 60 groups selected from optically - selected group catalogues observed by the _ rosat _",
    "x - ray satellite to enable x - ray classification . removing the 6 groups for which @xcite were unable to find at least 4 galaxies associated with the original optical position , leaves a sample of 54 groups with @xmath49 ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath47 .",
    "of these 54 groups , 35 have extended intra - group x - ray emission , 13 have x - ray emission only associated with the central galaxy and 6 are undetected ( at @xmath50 above background ) in x - rays . @xcite also identified the bgg and published the galaxies morphologies .",
    "all the gems groups are covered by the 2 micron all sky survey extended source catalogue ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "our photometric reductions were performed to be as consistent as possible with @xcite .",
    "all 54 groups are at redshifts @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and for a large proportion of the sample the circular aperture photometry in 2mass does not extend to large enough radii to measure an aperture of radius @xmath36 kpc ( the maximum possible radius @xmath53 kpc at @xmath54 ) .",
    "the aperture magnitudes for this sample were therefore measured manually from the 2mass scans and corrected to absolute magnitudes following @xcite .",
    "they have photometric uncertainties of @xmath39 mag .",
    "the group x - ray luminosities are taken from the gems group catalogue .",
    "these are bolometric luminosities , extrapolated to the radius corresponding to an overdensity of 500 times the critical density ( @xmath55 ) , with uncertainties of log@xmath56 .",
    "@xcite showed that the gems group x - ray luminosities are consistent with those measured by the _ rosat_-eso flux limited x - ray galaxy cluster survey ( reflex ; @xcite ) extrapolated to 12 times the core radius of the cluster , with an uncertainty of log@xmath57 .",
    "we repeated our low - redshift group and cluster analysis using reflex x - ray luminosities for the 40 clusters that are in common with this work and found that our results are unchanged .",
    "we therefore present this work using the full low - redshift sample of 92 clusters .",
    "we convert the group x - ray luminosities to the mass within an overdensity of 200 times the critical density , m@xmath58 , using the @xmath59m@xmath60 relation measured for 15 gems groups from @xcite .",
    "we then use the @xmath61  kev@xmath62m@xmath63 relation for clusters from @xcite for our clusters .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties in our mass measurements by performing a monte - carlo analysis of how the uncertainties in the @xmath64 measurements propagate through to our mass estimates given the uncertainty in the slope of the @xmath65m@xmath58 relation used for our conversion .",
    "these were found to be of order 0.08 in log m@xmath58 for the groups and 0.02 for the clusters .",
    "@xcite show that the @xcite relationship does not evolve significantly over the redshift range analysed here , we therefore use the cluster @xmath61",
    "kev@xmath62m@xmath58 relationship for our higher redshift sample .      in their bcg study , @xcite",
    "make the case that aperture magnitudes are not sensitive to the mass growth of bcgs and instead use 2mass @xmath35-band isophotal magnitudes ( measured within the 20th magnitude isophote ) .",
    "we test whether this affects our data in several different ways :    we compared the apparent magnitudes for the 24 galaxies in common with @xcite and found an offset of @xmath66 mag resulting from the use of the different measurements ( figure  [ comp_mag ] ) .",
    "this offset is not correlated with the magnitudes or with cluster mass .",
    "we re - measure the magnitudes in a larger aperture of @xmath67kpc for 4 bcgs at the same mean luminosity in high - mass ( @xmath68 ) , and in low - mass clusters ( @xmath69 ) . if we were subject to aperture effects then the magnitudes of the galaxies in the low - mass clusters would increase less than those in the high - mass clusters .",
    "however , the increases are consistent : @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "finally , we use the @xmath72-band surface brightness profiles from @xcite of 24 galaxies in common with this work .",
    "we then predicted ( assuming @xmath73 ) aperture luminosities within @xmath74 kpc and isophotal luminosities within @xmath75 magarcsec@xmath76 .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ comp_mag ] shows that aperture luminosities follow the same relationship as isophotal luminosities with cluster mass .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results are robust to any possible aperture effects .",
    "in the upper panel of figure  [ l_m_both ] we plot the bcg ( @xmath0 ) and bgg aperture @xmath35-band luminosities versus their host system mass . the galaxies in the lower - mass systems are fainter and , morphologically , more likely to be late - type galaxies ( sa to irr ) in systems without extended intra - group x - rays .",
    "the dispersion in the central galaxy luminosities decreases as the host halo mass increases , as also observed by @xcite .",
    "they suggest that this is a result of a broader distribution of major star formation epochs in lower mass halos .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that many of the galaxies in the low - mass halos are late - types .    fitting a relationship to these data we find @xmath77 for all bggs and bcgs",
    "this is steeper than has previously been observed .",
    "however , given that the extended x - ray emission characteristic of the potential well of a bound system is not detected in the less - massive groups , it is more reliable to determine this relationship from the early - type bggs in groups with extended x - ray emission and bcgs ( ebgg+bcg sample ) .",
    "for these we find a relationship @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with values from the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in these data have insignificant effect on the fitted relations . analysing the bcgs alone yields a shallower relation : @xmath79 .",
    "this relationship is consistent with no increase of bcg luminosity with increasing cluster mass .",
    "however , due to the scatter in the data it is also consistent with the relationship for the ebgg+bcg sample and with those relationships in the literature .",
    "whether the l@xmath8m@xmath9-relation evolves with redshift is also interesting .",
    "we examine the 63 bcgs at higher redshift ( @xmath1 ) in the lower panel of figure  [ l_m_both ] .",
    "the best - fitting relationship to these data is @xmath5 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the low - redshift relations .    in figure  [ comp_studies ]",
    "we show how our results compare to those measured in the literature , and to the predictions of cm05 and vo06 .",
    "to add another high - redshift ( @xmath80 ) point , we assume that because the @xcite data fit the vo06 model , they can be represented by @xmath81 .",
    "there is no appreciable offset between the relationship measured from hod analyses or directly from bcg samples .",
    "these suggest that there is no evolution in this relationship between @xmath54 and @xmath7 .",
    "our data are also consistent with the predictions of both cm05 and vo06 .",
    "bcgs are often thought to be the most conspicuous examples of central cluster galaxies undergoing rapid growth through merging .",
    "these data suggest a picture in which the near - infrared luminosity ( @xmath82stellar mass ) of early - type bcgs evolves steadily with the growth of their host cluster . in observing the l@xmath8m@xmath83-relation to have a slope @xmath84 at higher redshift",
    ", bcg growth appears to still be in the ` dynamical friction time - scale - limited ' regime ( as per cm05 ) at these earlier times .",
    "hence , bcg - halo mass growth is controlled by this restriction over the cosmic time interval studied here , and is not consistent with bcgs doubling in mass from @xmath7 to @xmath25 as suggested by @xcite .",
    "these observations are more consistent with bcgs accreting @xmath85 per cent in stellar mass as their cluster doubles in mass .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the observation that the position of bcgs on scaling relations such as the fundamental plane is a result of having undergone at least 1 major merger event ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these major merger events have been directly observed : @xcite observed a nearly equal - mass bcg merger in a @xmath86 cluster at @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite have observed a plume around a bcg in a @xmath88 cluster at @xmath89 .",
    "both of these systems lie within the scatter of our data on the l@xmath8m@xmath9-relation .",
    "observations of the mass assembly of other massive early - type galaxy populations are contradictory . some claim evidence for no evolution beyond passive for these galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , whilst others claim stellar mass evolution of a factor of 2 since @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) . in between these extremes",
    "are studies more consistent with this work , finding evidence for growth of @xmath90 per cent since @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", we have demonstrated that our data are consistent with the predictions of two hod models at @xmath91 .",
    "however , these models do not make predictions for higher redshifts . examining",
    "the evolution of bcgs in a @xmath92-cold dark matter universe , the semi - analytical model of @xcite predicts that @xmath93 per cent of the mass of bcgs is assembled since @xmath7 , with an equivalent growth in the host halo over this timescale .",
    "this is inconsistent with our observations .",
    "however , @xcite have analysed the stellar mass evolution of large red galaxies between @xmath94 and @xmath27 in the durham semi - analytic models , and find that , on average , large red galaxies assemble @xmath95 per cent of their mass since @xmath7",
    ".    the results presented in this letter are clearly consistent with the picture emerging from studies of the evolution of massive early - type galaxies and semi - analytic models of the evolution of these massive galaxies , that massive galaxies have increased in stellar mass by @xmath90 per cent since @xmath7 .",
    "we have examined the bgg and bcg luminosity  host halo mass relation at : @xmath0 and , at higher redshifts than previously measured : @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that :    * bcgs follow a relationship with the mass of their host cluster",
    ". this relationship does not evolve from @xmath7 to @xmath25 .",
    "* our data are consistent with the predictions of two illustrative hod models for the relationship of central galaxy luminosity with host halo mass . *",
