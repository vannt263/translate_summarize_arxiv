    "let @xmath1 be an open , simply connected , bounded set . for @xmath2 varying in @xmath3 , we consider the magnetic schrdinger operator @xmath4 acting on functions with zero boundary conditions on @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a magnetic potential of aharonov - bohm type , singular at the point @xmath7 .",
    "more specifically , the magnetic potential has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a fixed constant and @xmath11 . since the regular part @xmath12 does not play a significant role , throughout the paper we will suppose without loss of generality that @xmath13 .",
    "the magnetic field associated to this potential is a @xmath14-multiple of the dirac delta at @xmath7 , orthogonal to the plane .",
    "a quantum particle moving in @xmath15 will be affected by the magnetic potential , although it remains in a region where the magnetic field is zero ( aharonov - bohm effect @xcite ) .",
    "we can think at the particle as being affected by the non - trivial topology of the set @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in studying the behavior of the spectrum of the operator @xmath17 as @xmath7 moves in the domain and when it approaches its boundary . by standard spectral theory ,",
    "the spectrum of such operator consists of a diverging sequence of real positive eigenvalues ( see section [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the eigenvalues counted with their multiplicity ( see ) and by @xmath20 the corresponding eigenfunctions , normalized in the @xmath21-norm .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the extremal and critical points of the maps @xmath22 .",
    "one motivation for our study is that , in the case of half integer circulation , critical positions of the moving pole can be related to optimal partition problems .",
    "the link between spectral minimal partitions and nodal domains of eigenfunctions has been investigated in full detail in ( @xcite ) . by the results in @xcite , in two dimensions ,",
    "the boundary of a minimal partition is the union of finitely many regular arcs , meeting at some multiple intersection points dividing the angle in an equal fashion .",
    "if the multiplicity of the clustering domains is even , then the partition is nodal , i.e. it is the nodal set of an eigenfunction . on the other hand ,",
    "the results in @xcite suggest that the minimal partitions featuring a clustering point of odd multiplicity should be related to the nodal domains of eigenfunctions of aharonov - bohm hamiltonians which corresponds to a critical value of the eigenfunction with respect to the moving pole .",

    "the domain @xmath34 coincides with @xmath3 , so that it has a trivial topology . for this reason ,",
    "the magnetic potential is not experienced by a particle moving in @xmath3 and the operator acting on the particle is simply the laplacian .",
    "this result was first conjectured in the case @xmath35 in @xcite , where it was applied to show that the function @xmath36 has a global interior maximum , where it is not differentiable , corresponding to an eigenfunction of multiplicity exactly two .",
    "numerical simulations in @xcite supported the conjecture for every @xmath0 . during the completion of this work , we became aware that the continuity of the eigenvalues with respect to multiple moving poles has been obtained independently in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the continuous extension up to the boundary is a non - trivial issue because the nature of the the operator changes as @xmath7 approaches @xmath31 .",
    "this fact can be seen in the more specific case when @xmath37 , which is equivalent to the standard laplacian on the double covering ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we go then from a problem on a fixed domain with a varying operator ( which depends on the singularity @xmath7 ) to a problem with a fixed operator ( the laplacian ) and a varying domain ( for the convergence of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators on varying domains , we refer to @xcite ) . in this second case ,",
    "the singularity is transferred from the operator into the domain . indeed , when @xmath7 approaches the boundary , the double covering develops a corner at the origin .",
