    "nonzero neutrino mass is necessary to explain the well - established phenomenon of neutrino oscillations in many experiments .",
    "theoretically , neutrino masses are usually assumed to be majorana and come from physics at an energy scale higher than that of electroweak symmetry breaking of order 100 gev . as such",
    ", the starting point of any theoretical discussion of the underlying theory of neutrino mass is the effective dimension - five operator  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the three left - handed lepton doublets of the standard model ( sm ) and @xmath10 is the one higgs scalar doublet . as @xmath11 acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath12 ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath13 note that @xmath14 breaks lepton number @xmath5 by two units .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( 2 ) that neutrino mass is seesaw in character , because it is inversely proportional to the large effective scale @xmath15 .",
    "the three well - known tree - level seesaw realizations  @xcite of @xmath14 may be categorized by the specific heavy particle used to obtain it : ( i ) neutral fermion singlet @xmath16 , ( ii ) scalar triplet @xmath0 , ( iii ) fermion triplet @xmath17 .",
    "it is also possible to realize @xmath14 radiatively in one loop  @xcite with the particles in the loop belonging to the dark sector , the lightest neutral one being the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the simplest such example  @xcite is the well - studied `` scotogenic '' model , from the greek scotos meaning darkness .",
    "the one - loop diagram is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "scotogenic neutrino mass . ]",
    "the new particles are a second scalar doublet @xmath18 and three neutral singlet fermions @xmath19 .",
    "the dark @xmath20 is odd for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , whereas all sm particles are even .",
    "this is thus a type i radiative seesaw model .",
    "it is of course possible to replace @xmath16 with @xmath21 , so it becomes a type iii radiative seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "what then about type ii ?",
    "since @xmath14 is a dimension - five operator , any loop realization is guaranteed to be finite . on the other hand ,",
    "if a higgs triplet @xmath0 is added to the sm , a dimension - four coupling @xmath22 is allowed . as @xmath23 obtains a small vacuum expectation value  @xcite from its interaction with the sm higgs doublet , neutrinos acquire small majorana masses , i.e. type ii tree - level seesaw .",
    "if an exact symmetry is used to forbid this dimension - four coupling , it will also forbid any possible loop realization of it .",
    "hence a type ii radiative seesaw is only possible if the symmetry used to forbid the hard dimension - four coupling is softly broken in the loop , as recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry used to forbid the hard @xmath24 coupling is lepton number @xmath25 under which @xmath26 . the scalar trilinear @xmath27 term is allowed and induces a small @xmath28 , but",
    "@xmath4 remains massless . to connect @xmath23 to @xmath29 in one loop , we add a new dirac fermion doublet @xmath30 with @xmath1 , together with three complex neutral scalar singlets @xmath31 with @xmath32 . the resulting one - loop diagram is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "higgs triplet . ]",
    "note that the hard terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 are allowed by @xmath5 conservation , whereas the @xmath35 terms break @xmath5 softly by two units to @xmath6 .",
    "a dark @xmath20 parity , i.e. @xmath36 , exists under which @xmath37 are odd and @xmath38 are even .",
    "hence the lightest @xmath31 is a possible dark - matter candidate .",
    "the three @xmath31 scalars are the analogs of the three right - handed sneutrinos in supersymmetry , and @xmath39 are the analogs of the two higgsinos . however , their interactions are simpler here and less constrained .",
    "the usual understanding of the type ii seesaw mechanism is that the scalar trilinear term @xmath40 induces a small vacuum expectation value @xmath41 if either @xmath42 is small or @xmath43 is large or both .",
    "more precisely , consider the scalar potential of @xmath44 and @xmath3 .",

    "the physical masses of the @xmath1 higgs triplet are then given by @xmath52 since the hard term @xmath24 is forbidden , @xmath49 by itself does not generate a neutrino mass .",
    "its value does not have to be extremely small compared to the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "for example @xmath53 gev is acceptable , because its contribution to the precisely measured @xmath54 parameter @xmath55  @xcite is only of order @xmath56 . with the soft breaking of @xmath5 to @xmath6 shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "type ii radiative seesaw neutrino masses are obtained .",
    "let the relevant yukawa interactions be given by @xmath57 together with the allowed mass terms @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the @xmath5 breaking soft term @xmath60 , then @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 using for example @xmath65 , @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath67 ev for @xmath53 gev .",
    "this implies that @xmath3 may be as light as a few hundred gev and be observable , with @xmath68 gev . for @xmath69 and @xmath70 a few hundred gev ,",
    "the new contributions to the anomalous muon magnetic moment and @xmath71 are negligible in this model .    in the case of three neutrinos , there are of course three @xmath31 scalars . assuming that the @xmath5 breaking soft terms @xmath72 neutrino mass matrix is diagonal to a very good approximation in the basis where the @xmath31 mass - squared matrix is diagonal .",
    "this means that the dark scalars @xmath73 couples to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the neutrino mixing matrix linking @xmath76 to the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath77 .",
    "the salient feature of any type ii seesaw model is the doubly charged higgs boson @xmath7 .",
    "if there is a tree - level @xmath78 coupling , then the dominant decay of @xmath7 is to @xmath79 .",
    "current experimental limits  @xcite on the mass of @xmath7 into @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 final states are about 490 to 550 gev , assuming for each a 100% branching fraction . in the present model ,",
    "since the effective @xmath78 coupling is one - loop suppressed , @xmath83 should be considered  @xcite instead , for which the present limit on @xmath84 is only about 84 gev  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated search of the @xmath85 mode in the future is clearly called for .    if @xmath86 , then the decay channel @xmath87 opens up and will dominate . in that case , the subsequent decay @xmath88 , i.e. charged lepton plus missing energy , will be the signature .",
    "the present experimental limit  @xcite on @xmath70 , assuming electroweak pair production , is about 260 gev if @xmath89 gev for a 100% branching fraction to @xmath90 or @xmath42 , and no limit if @xmath91 gev .",
    "there is also a lower threshold for @xmath7 decay , i.e. @xmath84 sufficiently greater than @xmath92 , for which @xmath7 decays through a virtual @xmath93 pair to @xmath94 , resulting in same - sign dileptons plus missing energy .     at 13 tev . ]    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the pair production cross section of @xmath95 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at a center - of - mass energy of 13 tev .",
    "we assume that @xmath96 and @xmath23 are heavier than @xmath7 so that we can focus only on the decay products of @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath98 mode is always possible and should be looked for experimentally in any case .",
    "however , as already noted , a much more interesting possibility is the case @xmath86 , with the subsequent decay @xmath88 .",
    "this would yield four charged leptons plus missing energy , and depending on the linear combination of charged leptons coupling to @xmath31 , there could be exotic final states which have very little sm background , becoming thus excellent signatures to search for .",
    "suppose @xmath99 is the lightest scalar , and @xmath100 are heavier than @xmath101 , then @xmath101 decays to @xmath102 .",
    "hence the decay of @xmath95 could yield for example @xmath103 plus four @xmath99 ( missing energy ) in the final state .",
    "recent lhc searches for multilepton signatures at 8 tev by cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite are consistent with sm expectations , and are potential restrictions on our model .",
    "in particular , the cms study includes rare sm events such as @xmath104 and @xmath105 . due to the absence of opposite - sign , same - flavor ( ossf ) @xmath106 pairs ,",
    "both events are classified as ossf@xmath107 where lepton @xmath108 refers to electron , muon , or hadronically decaying tau .",
    "leptonic tau decays contribute to the electron and muon counts , and this determines the ossf@xmath109 category .",

    "generated events intially have 4 leptons .",
    "about half are detected as 3 lepton events , but the constraints from signal regions sr4-sr6 are less restrictive than sr1-sr3 .",
    "the number of detected events in the ossf0 @xmath132 4 lepton category is almost the same as @xmath133 with very few additional leptons from showering or initial / final state radiation .    to examine the production of @xmath134 we take the mass of @xmath99 to be 130 gev , which allows @xmath99 to be dark matter as discussed in the next section .",

    "a similar analysis performed for 8 tev at 19.5  fb@xmath137 has a maximum number of detected events of 0.4 in the plot analogous to fig .",

    "the lightest @xmath31 , say @xmath99 , is dark matter .",
    "its interaction with leptons is too weak to provide a large enough annihilation cross section to explain the present dark matter relic density @xmath143 of the universe .",
    "however , it also interacts with the sm higgs boson through the usual quartic coupling @xmath144 . for a value of @xmath145 consistent with @xmath143 , the direct - detection cross section in underground experiments",

    "the mass - squared matrix spanning @xmath148 is given by @xmath149 whereas the coupling matrix of the one higgs @xmath150 to @xmath148 is @xmath151 .",
    "upon diagonalizing @xmath152 , the coupling matrix will not be diagonal in general . in the physical basis",
    ", @xmath99 will interact with @xmath153 through @xmath150 .",
    "this allows the annihilation of @xmath154 to @xmath155 through @xmath153 exchange , and contributes to @xmath143 without affecting the @xmath99 scattering cross section off nuclei through @xmath150 .",

    "the additional choice @xmath161 ensures that @xmath100 are heavier than @xmath99 , and is convenient because then the relic abundance requirement no longer depends explicitly on @xmath162 .",

    "5 we plot the allowed values for @xmath166 and @xmath157 taking @xmath158 for simplicity to satisfy the lux data .    another possible scenario is to add a light scalar @xmath167 with @xmath1 , which acts as a mediator for @xmath31 self - interactions .",
    "this has important astrophysical implications  @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath154 annihilating to @xmath168 becomes possible .",
    "we have studied a new radiative type ii seesaw model of neutrino mass with dark matter  @xcite , which predicts a doubly charged higgs boson @xmath7 with suppressed decay to @xmath169 , thereby evading the present lhc bounds of 490 to 550 gev on its mass . in this model",

    "the subsequent decay of @xmath101 is into a charged lepton @xmath170 and a scalar @xmath31 which is dark matter .",
    "hence there is the interesting possibility of four charged leptons , such as @xmath171 , plus large missing energy in the final state .",
