    "since its discovery in 1877 by j. kerr @xcite the magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) has evolved into a very powerful tool for characterization of magnetic materials . due to its high sensitivity moke magnetometry is widely used for thin film and multilayer analysis .",
    "the high lateral resolution of modern moke magnetometry enables the study of individual magnetic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "recent developments using stroboscopic magneto - optic techniques achieved high time resolution @xcite , thus enabling the study of the magnetization dynamics on a picosecond - time scale . using second harmonic generation in moke measurements results in a high sensitivity to the magnetization at the interfaces between different materials @xcite .",
    "the origin of magneto - optic effects is the spin - orbit interaction . in many cases",
    "it is sufficient to treat the magneto - optic response in first order , i.e. take into account only contributions linearly proportional to the magnetization .",
    "however as first shown by osgood _",
    "@xcite second - order magneto - optic effects can be important in thin films with in - plane anisotropy . in particular for magnetization reversal measurements using moke magnetometry the second - order contributions can lead to asymmetric hysteresis loops @xcite , which are not observed using other magnetometry methods . on the other hand in exchange bias systems , which consist of a ferromagnet exchange coupled to an antiferromagnet , asymmetric hysteresis loops have been reported independently of the magnetometry method @xcite .",
    "therefore special care is necessary when investigating exchange bias systems using magneto - optical kerr effect magnetometry in order to distinguish between the effects caused by second - order magneto - optics and those caused by the broken symmetry due to the exchange bias effect .    in this article",
    "we use the epitaxial @xmath0/@xmath1  exchange bias model system to show how second - order magneto - optic effects affect the magnetization reversal observed in moke magnetometry . by utilizing a simple procedure described in this article both the first- and second - order effects",
    "can easily be separated .",
    "the experimental data is summarized and compared with an extended stoner - wohlfarth model using magnetization reversal diagrams .",
    "our approach builds upon a method to extract the linear and the quadratic kerr contributions from kerr effect measurements , which has recently been proposed by mattheis et al . , and in which a magnetic field of constant field strength is rotated about the axis normal to the sample surface , ( `` rotmoke '' method , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to this method , which is reminiscent to a torque measurement , the method proposed in the current article is based on the analysis of the magnetization reversal of the sample under investigation .",
    "the samples were prepared in an uhv system with a base pressure of @xmath2 mbar . in order to epitaxially grow @xmath0/@xmath1",
    "bilayers single crystalline mgo(001 ) substrates were used , first depositing a buffer layer system consisting of fe(0.5nm)/pt(5nm)/cu(100 nm ) described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the samples consist of a 10 nm thick @xmath0layer and a 5 nm thick @xmath1  layer covered by 2 nm cu in order to ensure symmetric interfaces and by 1.5 nm cr to prevent oxidation .",
    "the different materials were evaporated using either an e - beam evaporator ( fe , pt , @xmath1 , cr ) or knudsen cells ( cu , mn ) , with typical evaporation rates ranging from 0.01nm / s to 0.1nm / s .",
    "the layer composition and crystallographic structure was characterized using a combined low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and auger system .",
    "further structural investigation was performed using reflecting high energy diffraction ( rheed ) and _ in - situ _ scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "the samples were heated after deposition in uhv slightly above the bulk nel - temperature of @xmath0(500 k ) , while a magnetic field of 500 oe was applied along the in - plane [ 100]-direction of @xmath1during cool down .",
    "a @xmath0  layer deposited on top of the cu(001 ) buffer layer by co - evaporation of fe by e - beam evaporation and mn from a knudsen cell also grows in ( 001 ) orientation , with @xmath3_{femn}||[100]_{cu}$ ] .",
    "the surface morphology consists of rather large terraces with small monoatomic islands on top .",
    "these small islands have a large size distribution , as can be seen in the stm image in fig .",
    "[ stm ] ( a ) .",
    "@xmath1  deposited on @xmath0(001 ) also grows in ( 001 ) orientation but shows a broadening of the leed spots due to formation of small islands with an average size of 10 nm , while the larger terraces of the underlying @xmath0  are still visible , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ stm ] ( b ) .",
    "the magnetic properties of a @xmath0(10 nm)/@xmath1(5 nm ) bilayer are measured using kerr effect magnetometry .",
    "the magnetic field is applied collinear to the plane of the incident s - polarized light .",
    "the angle @xmath4 of the in - plane [ 100]-direction of the @xmath1layer relative to the plane of the incident light is varied from 0 to 360degree in 1 degree steps by rotating the sample .",
    "for all experimental data obtained from this rotation the decreasing field branch is shown in fig .",
    "[ kerroriginal ] , using a magnetization reversal diagram with a grayscale proportional to the kerr - rotation .",
    "this kind of data visualization enables the presentation of the whole angular dependence of the magnetization reversal in a single diagram and was described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in this figure the magnetization reversal diagram of the @xmath0/@xmath1  exchange bias system shows an asymmetry , which is characteristic for quadratic contributions to the kerr rotation , as will be shown in the following .",
    "this asymmetry impedes a correct determination of the angular dependence of the coercive field and the exchange bias field from the raw data causing those quantities to be asymmetric with respect to the in - plane angle @xmath4 .",
    "the kerr rotation @xmath5 in longitudinal geometry with s - polarized light and the sample magnetized in the plane of the sample surface , can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the in - plane magnetization components parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence of the light .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the longitudinal and quadratic proportionality factors of the kerr rotation .",
    "the second order term proportional to the product of the longitudinal and transverse component is the reflection analogy of the voigt effect @xcite and gives rise to the asymmetry observed in fig .",
    "[ kerroriginal ] .",
    "the two contributions to the kerr rotation can be separated by making use of the symmetry of the problem as follows . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , if the in - plane angle @xmath4 of the sample with respect to the plane of the incident light is changed by 180deg and the sign of the magnetic field @xmath11 is reversed the same magnetization reversal process should be observed .",
    "however by doing so the first term in equation ( [ kerr1 ] ) proportional to @xmath7 changes sign while the second term proportional to @xmath12 will have the same sign for both sample orientations .",
    "this leads to apparently different magnetization reversal curves observed in kerr effect magnetometry , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ reversal ] ( a ) .     +    by calculating the difference of the magnetization reversal for @xmath4 and @xmath13deg the kerr rotation @xmath14 caused by the longitudinal component of the magnetization @xmath7 can be reconstructed : @xmath15/2\\\\ & = & \\vartheta_{kerr}^{long}m_{\\|}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is shown in fig .",
    "[ reversal ] ( b ) for the magnetization reversals shown in part ( a ) of the same figure . on the other hand the quadratic contribution @xmath16 to the kerr rotation can be obtained by calculating the average of the kerr rotation at @xmath4 and @xmath17deg : @xmath18/2\\\\ & = & \\vartheta_{kerr}^{quad}m_{\\|}m_{\\perp},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ reversal ] ( c ) .    by carrying out the same kind of analysis for all angles @xmath4 the magnetization reversal diagram for @xmath14 , i.e. for the longitudinal component of the magnetization , can be reconstructed , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ revdiag ] ( a ) .",
    "consequently in this figure the asymmetry that was observed in fig .",
    "[ kerroriginal ] is no longer present .",
    "note however , that the symmetry breaking effect of the exchange bias effect is still visible in this diagram .",
    "a similar diagram can be constructed for the quadratic contribution @xmath16 to the kerr rotation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ revdiag ] ( b ) . as",
    "this diagram contains information about the product @xmath12 it reflects the corresponding symmetry ( see also fig .",
    "[ theoreversal ] ( b ) discussed later ) .",
    "the reversal data of the longitudinal component of the magnetization in fig .",
    "[ revdiag ] ( a ) is used to derive the angular dependence of the exchange bias field @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ hebhc ] ( a ) ) and the coercive field @xmath20 ( see fig . [ hebhc ] ( b ) ) of the @xmath0/@xmath1  double layer system .",
    "these angular dependencies are then fitted assuming a coherent rotation of the magnetization and using the perfect - delay convention @xcite within the framework of an extended stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite .",
    "the experimental data can be reasonably well described by including a unidirectional anisotropy @xmath21 and a fourfold anisotropy @xmath22 contribution to gibb s free energy @xmath23 of the system , which in turn can be written as : @xmath24 a fit of the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "[ hebhc ] using the gibb s free energy given by equation [ freeenergy ] results in a unidirectional anisotropy @xmath25erg/@xmath26 and a fourfold anisotropy @xmath27erg/@xmath26 .",
    "note that the appearance of an induced fourfold anisotropy in addition to the unidirectional anisotropy in epitaxial @xmath0/@xmath1-bilayer systems has recently been shown theoretically using a vector spin model @xcite .",
    "the resulting angular dependence of the exchange bias field @xmath19 and the coercive field @xmath20 predicted by the extended stoner - wohlfarth model is also shown in fig .",
    "[ hebhc ] .    in order to complete the picture of the magnetization reversal that results from these anisotropies within the extended stoner - wohlfarth model in fig .",
    "[ theoreversal ] the reversal diagrams are given for both @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "these two diagrams correspond to the expected linear and second - order contribution to the magneto - optic kerr effect respectively and can therefore be directly compared with the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ revdiag ] .    given the simplification of a coherent magnetization reversal process assumed in the extended stoner - wohlfarth model and the small number of fitting parameters the agreement between the model and the experimental results is surprisingly good .",
    "however one notices differences between the model calculations and the experimental results especially along the axis parallel to the easy direction of the unidirectional anisotropy , i.e. around 0deg and 180deg .",
    "similar deviations have been observed in epitaxial nife / femn bilayers @xcite ( i.e. in a system with reversed layer sequence ) and may be related to thermal activation @xcite or to domain formation and propagation , which are not taken into account in the stoner - wohlfarth model .",
    "in summary we have shown that second - order magneto - optic effects are present in exchange coupled epitaxial @xmath0/@xmath1-bilayers . by using the method described in this article it",
    "is possible to separate the first- and second - order contributions .",
    "thereby the asymmetry related to magneto - optics can also be separated from the one associated with the exchange bias effect .",
    "the experimental data can thus be analyzed within an extended stoner - wohlfarth model , which describes well the overall angular dependence of the magnetization reversal .",
    "the observed differences between the experimental data and the stoner - wohlfarth model may be caused by thermal activation or domain formation and propagation .",
