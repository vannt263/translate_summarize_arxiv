    "the mechanisms involved in galaxy formation is still one of the major unsolved problems in astrophysics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) , which are considered to be debris of the galaxy formation , have a record about the information on both their formation condition and dynamical evolution within the environment of their host galaxies , which are reflected by their spatial structures and kinematics @xcite .",
    "so , gcs are regarded as a laboratory of galaxy history @xcite .",
    "in addition , gcs can be used as one of excellent tracers of substructures in the outer regions of their parent galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite identified the accretion signature of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy among the gcs in the outer halo of the milky way ( mw ) ; @xcite found some of the gcs in the outer halo of m31 are rather unlike their mw counterparts as they are metal - poor , compact , and very luminous , which may well offer important clues to differences in the early formation and evolution of the two galaxies or in their subsequent accretion histories ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "thus , a detailed study of gcs in the outer halo of a galaxy is important .",
    "m31 , with a distance of @xmath2 kpc from us @xcite , is the largest galaxy in the local group , and it is so close to us that the gcs in it can be well resolved with the cameras on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "m31 contains more gcs than all other local group galaxies combined with 654 confirmed gcs and 606 gc candidates in the version v4.0 of the revised bologna catalogue ( rbc ) of m31 gcs @xcite .",
    "m31 contains so many gcs that a variety of clusters may be included such as classic globulars , extended and diffuse globulars @xcite , intermediate - age globulars @xcite and young massive clusters @xcite .",
    "gcs in the outer halo of m31 have been discussed by many authors @xcite , which may provide important clues for the accretion and interaction events between m31 and surrounding galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite found a genuine physical association between gcs and multiple tidal debris streams in the outer regions of m31 , implying that the remote gc system of m31 was largely accreted from the satellite galaxies ( also reported in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "structures and kinematics of gcs can be determined by fitting different models to the surface brightness profiles , combined with mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath3 values ) estimated from velocity dispersions or population - synthesis models . in general , three models are used in the fits : the simple model of single - mass , isotropic , modified isothermal sphere developed by @xcite , an alternate modified isothermal sphere based on the ad hoc stellar distribution function of @xcite , and the @xmath4 surface - density profile of @xcite . with these models ,",
    "many authors have achieved some success in determining structures and kinematics of clusters from different galaxies , using images from ground - based telescopes or _",
    "hst _ : the mw @xcite ; the large and small magellanic clouds , fornax and sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite ; m31 @xcite ; m33 @xcite ; ngc 5128 @xcite .",
    "a number of studies focusing on the correlations between cluster parameters have been performed , which showed that there exists a fundamental plane among most clusters , regardless of their different `` growing environment '' in different host galaxies .",
    "@xcite derived structural parameters for 34 gcs in m31 based on _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) observations , and the derived structural parameters were combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earlier survey in order to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamical parameters for 93 m31 gcs .",
    "@xcite measured structural parameters for 23 bright young clusters in m31 based on the _ hst _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) observations , and suggested that on average they are larger and more concentrated than typical old clusters .",
    "however , the sample clusters from @xcite and @xcite lie at projected radii @xmath5 kpc except for five clusters g001 , g002 , g339 , g353 and b468 , the projected radii of which are 34.55 , 33.62 , 28.68 , 26.32 and 20.05 kpc , respectively ; and most of the sample clusters lie at projected radii @xmath6 kpc .",
    "so , structural parameters for gcs in the outer halo of m31 are worthwhile to be determined . in addition , @xcite derived structural parameters for 13 extended clusters ( ecs ) in the halo regions of m31 by fitting the @xcite profiles to the photometry data taken with the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) and megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope , which may provide an interesting comparison with the structural parameters for gcs in the outer halo of m31 .    in this paper , we determined spatial structures and kinematics for ten gcs in the outskirts of m31 . in section 2 , we give observations of the sample gcs and the data - processing steps to derive their surface brightness profiles . in section 3 , we determine structures and kinematics of the sample clusters with the model fitting . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss correlations of the structural and kinematic parameters of the sample clusters here combining with those of the galactic and m31 clusters studied by other authors .",
    "finally , we give our summaries in section 5 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a detailed study of gcs in the outer halo of a galaxy is important , since they can serve as one of excellent tracers of substructures in the outer regions of their parent galaxy .",
    "till now , for m31 , most of the clusters whose structural parameters have been determined , lie at projected radii @xmath6 kpc .",
    "so , structural parameters for gcs in the outer halo of m31 are worthwhile to be measured . in this paper , detailed studies of the structures of a sample of ten gcs in the outer halo of m31 from @xcite",
    "will be presented .",
    "these sample halo gcs are interesting .",
    "for example , @xcite found some of them are rather unlike their mw counterparts as they are metal - poor , compact , and very luminous ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "eight of the ten halo gcs lie at projected radii @xmath7 kpc , of which two lie at very large distances from m31 : @xmath8 and 100 kpc , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xcite estimated their metallicities , distance moduli and reddening values by fitting the galactic gc fiducials from @xcite to their observed color - magnitude diagrams in the f606w and f814w filters of deep images observed with the the acs wide field camera ( wfc ) under the _ hst _ program go-10394 ( pi : tanvir ) .",
    "this program was aimed to obtain deep high resolution photometry of outer halo gcs in m31 to study their stellar populations , line - of - sight distances and structural parameters .",
    "targets were imaged in the f606w and f814w filters for @xmath9  1800s and @xmath9  3000s , respectively , with small dithers between various sub - exposures @xcite .",
    "we used the analogous procedure adopted by @xcite to produce surface brightness profiles with ellipse in iraf .",
    "the center positions of these clusters were determined by centroiding .",
    "elliptical isophotes were fitted to the observed data , with no sigma clipping .",
    "two passes of ellipse task were run in the procedure . in the first",
    "pass , ellipticity and position angle ( p.a . )",
    "were allowed to vary with the isophote semimajor axes ; in the second pass , surface brightness profiles were derived on fixed , zero - ellipticity isophotes , meaning that we always had circularly symmetric intensity profiles , which would be fitted with circular structure models .",
    "the overall ellipticity and position angle were determined by averaging the ellipse output over the isophotal semimajor axes , and the uncertainty is @xmath10 .",
    "table 1 lists the average ellipticity , p.a . and",
    "some additional integrated data for the sample gcs . @xmath11 magnitudes of 9 gcs and @xmath12 magnitude of gc6 are from @xcite , while @xmath13 magnitude of gc6 is from @xcite .",
    "the galactocentric distances , distance moduli , reddening values and metallicities are from @xcite , while the uncertainties of [ fe / h ] are assumed to be 0.6 as @xcite suggested for the standard deviation of the metallicity distribution of m31 gc system .",
    "raw output from package ellipse is in terms of counts s@xmath14 pixel@xmath14 , which needs to multiply by 400 to convert to counts s@xmath14 arcsec@xmath14 , since the acs / wfc spatial resolution is 0.05 arcsec pixel@xmath14 . for drizzled acs data ,",
    "the units of counts are electrons ( acs handbook ) .",
    "two formulas were used to transform the acs counts to surface brightness calibrated on the vegamag system ( acs handbook ) ,    @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18    however , occasional oversubtraction of background during the multidrizzling in the automatic reduction pipeline leads to `` negative '' counts in some pixels , so we worked in terms of linear intensity instead of surface brightness in magnitudes .",
    "given @xmath19 , @xmath20cnaw / sun.html .",
    "] , equations for transforming counts to surface brightness in intensity were derived ( also see * ? ? ? * for details ) , @xmath21 @xmath22    table 2 gives the final , calibrated intensity profiles for the ten clusters but with no extinction corrected .",
    "the reported f606w- and f814w - band intensities are calibrated on the vegamag scale .",
    "column ( 7 ) gives a flag for each point , which has the same meaning as @xcite and @xcite defined .",
    "as noted by @xcite and @xcite that , though the sample gcs here are well resolved with acs / wfc , the core structures are still influenced by the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we convolved the structural models developed by @xcite ( hereafter ` king model ' ) with a simple analytic description of the psf before doing the model fitting , as given in @xcite , @xmath23^{-3.69/3.0 } , \\label{eq : psf1}\\ ] ] and @xmath24^{-3.56/3.0 } , \\label{eq : psf2}\\ ] ] with fwhms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the f606w and f814w filters , respectively .",
    "when we fit models to the brightness profiles of the sample clusters , we will correct the inferred intensity profiles for extinction .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the acs f606w and f814w filters are @xmath27 5918 and 8060  @xcite . with the extinction curve @xmath28 taken from @xcite with @xmath29 , two formulas for computing @xmath30 and @xmath31 are derived : @xmath32 ; @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , for easy comparison with catalogs of the gcs in the mw ( see section 4 for details ) , we transform the acs / wfc magnitudes in the f606w filter to the standard @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite has given transformations from wfc to standard @xmath34 magnitudes both on observed and synthetic methods ( see their table 22 ) .",
    "as synthetic transformations are based on larger color range and more safely employed , they should be considered the norm , unless some indicated cases @xcite .",
    "we used the synthetic transformation from f606w to @xmath13 magnitude both on the vegamag scale with a quadratic dependence on dereddened @xmath35 . with the magnitudes in @xmath13 and @xmath12 bands and reddening values",
    "listed in table 1 , we found the @xmath35 values of all the sample clusters are larger than 0.4 .",
    "so , the following transformation formula was applied here ,    @xmath36 @xmath37 for which we estimated a precision of about @xmath38 mag .",
    "[ fig1 ]    there are a number of possible choices of structural models for fitting star cluster surface profiles , including king model , @xcite , and @xcite , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "king model is the most commonly used model in studies of star clusters .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that m31 clusters are better fitted by king models .",
    "so , in this paper , the intensity profiles of the ten gcs in m31 will be fitted by king models defined by the phase - space distribution function , @xmath39 - 1 , &       & e < 0 , \\\\ 0 ,                        &       & e \\geq 0 , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the stellar energy , @xmath41 is a velocity scale .",
    "we first convolved king model with the acs / wfc psf for the f606w and f814w filters .",
    "given a value for the scale radius @xmath42 , we computed a dimensionless model profile @xmath43 , and then carried out the convolution ,    @xmath44 $ ] @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ; and @xmath48 was approximated using the equations ( [ eq : psf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : psf2 ] ) ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the observed surface brightness profiles were fitted by calculating and minimizing @xmath49 as the sum of squared differences between model and observed intensities , with uncertainties listed in table 2 being weights , @xmath50 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}},\\ ] ] in which a background @xmath51 was also fitted .",
    "figure 1 displays the observed intensity profiles as a function of logarithmic projected radius and the best - fitting king model ( solid red line ) for each cluster .",
    "the observed data have been extinction corrected , following by a fitted @xmath51 subtracted .",
    "the dashed blue lines represent the shape of the psf for the wfc f606w or f814w filters .",
    "most profiles of the sample clusters were well fitted by king model , except for those at the intermediate radii of gc3 , gc7 and gc9 .",
    "we checked the images , and found that the three clusters are very loose and there are several bright stars at the intermediate radii .    in figure 1 ,",
    "open squares are ellipse data points included in the least - squares model fitting , and the crosses are points flagged as ` dep ' or ` bad ' , which are not used to constrain the fit . in this paper ,",
    "the ellipse gives isophotal intensities for @xmath52 radii inside @xmath53 pixels , however , all of them are derived from the same innermost @xmath54 pixels , meaning that the isophotal intensities are not statistically independent .",
    "so , to avoid excessive weighting of the central regions of clusters in the fits , we only used intensities at radii @xmath55 , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 pixels as @xcite used .",
    "in addition , we deleted some individual isophotes which deviated strongly from their neighbours or showed irregular features by hand .",
    "table 3 lists the basic parameters of 20 model fits to the sample clusters here .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the cluster name , column ( 2 ) the detector / filter from which the observed data were derived .",
    "column ( 3 ) gives the color correction @xmath58 to transform native instrumental magnitudes to the standard @xmath13 scale .",
    "the fourth column shows the number of points in the intensity profile that are flagged as ` ok ' in table 2 , which were used for constraining the model fits .",
    "column ( 5 ) is the fitting model which is always king model here .",
    "column ( 6 ) gives the minimum @xmath49 obtained in the fits .",
    "column ( 7 ) gives the best fitted background intensity .",
    "column ( 8) gives the dimensionless central potential @xmath59 of the best - fitting model , defined as @xmath60 . column ( 9 ) gives the concentration @xmath61 .",
    "column ( 10 ) gives the best - fit central surface brightness in the native bandpass of the data .",
    "column ( 11 ) and column ( 12 ) show the best model - fit scale radius @xmath42 in arcseconds and parsecs , respectively , while the latter was obtained from the angular scale with the distance moduli given in table 1 .",
    "uncertainties for the fitted model parameters were estimated following @xmath62 for 68% confidence intervals . however , as @xcite pointed out , because the formal error bars estimated by ellipse for the isophotal intensities are artificially small , the best - fit @xmath63 can be exceedingly high ( @xmath64 ; the number of points used in the model fitting ) even when a model fit is actually very good ( see the values of @xmath63 in table 3 ) , and this would result in unrealistically small estimates of parameter uncertainties .",
    "so , we also re - scale the @xmath49 for all fitted models by a common factor chosen to make the global minimum @xmath65 as @xcite did .",

    "as noted by @xcite , @xcite listed several possible factors for the elongation of gcs : internal rotation , galaxy tides , cluster mergers , and `` remnant elongation '' from some clusters former lives as dwarf galaxy nuclei .",
    "cluster rotation is generally accepted to be a major factor for cluster flattening @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite presented that the brightest gcs in both the mw and m31 are most flattened , which can be explained by the cluster mergers and `` remnant elongation '' .",

    "@xcite presented that , the distributions of ellipticities for the m31 and ngc 5128 clusters and the old clusters in the large megallanic cloud , are very similar , but different from the mw . with a large cluster sample ,",

    "so , @xcite concluded that there is no evidence that the overall galaxy environment is a major factor .",

    "these outer halo gcs lie at large projected radii than most sample clusters in @xcite , their large ellipticities may be due to galaxy tides coming from satellite dwarf galaxies of m31 or may be related to the apparently more vigorous accretion or merger history that m31 has experienced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite showed ellipticity as a function of luminosity and half - mass relaxation time for clusters in m31 , ngc 5128 and the mw , since if it is true , relaxation through dynamical evolution should act to reduce any initial flattening ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these authors found a mild systematic decrease in ellipticity with increased luminosity , although considerable scatter , and no correlation of ellipticity with relaxation time is evident .",
    "so , @xcite concluded that the observed distribution of gc ellipticity appears to be due to a number of factors .",
    "figure 4 displays ellipticity as a function of model luminosity and half - mass relaxation time for clusters in the mw and m31 , including the outer halo gcs in m31 studied here .",
    "it is evident that , when we add the data for the outer halo gcs in m31 obtained here , the conclusion of @xcite will not evidently change , although the mild systematic decrease in ellipticity with increased luminosity nearly disappears . in addition , we think that the larger ellipticities of the outer halo gcs of m31 than most of gcs in m31 and the mw may be due to galaxy tides coming from satellite dwarf galaxies of m31 or may be related to the apparently more vigorous accretion or merger history that m31 has experienced .",
    "as @xcite noted that , previous studies have shown that structures of the mw gcs are largely independent of galactocentric distances and metallicity , except for the correlation of half - light radius with galactocentric distances . @xcite",

    "* ) and ngc 5128 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite concluded that the correlations of @xmath97 and @xmath42 with @xmath106 for gcs in both the mw and m31 are due to physical conditions at the time of cluster formation as suggested by @xcite for mw gcs .",
    "@xcite showed structural parameters as a function of galactocentric distance for gcs in the mw , the magellanic clouds and fornax dwarf spheroidal , ngc 5128 , and m31 , and found similar results .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that there is a clear trend of increasing @xmath97 with increasing @xmath106 for the galactic gcs .",
    "we should notice that the galactocentric distances are true three - dimensional distances for galactic gcs and projected radii for m31 clusters .",

    "it is evident that , when we add the data for the outer halo gcs in m31 obtained here , the conclusion of @xcite will not change , with the exception that the galactocentric distances of m31 clusters can reach to 100 kpc which are as distant as the mw clusters . in addition , it is true that m31 young massive clusters have larger @xmath71 and @xmath97 than old gcs at the same galactocentric distances . for comparing with @xcite ( their figure 9 ) ,",

    "it can be seen that , at large raddi ( from 30 to 100 kpc ) there are few gcs having @xmath97 in the range from 8 to 15 pc , which is in agreement with the finding of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed structural parameters as a function of [ fe / h ] for clusters in m31 and the mw , and found that there is no correlation of metallicity with concentration @xmath71 or central surface brightness @xmath107 , but there does appear to be a correlation with size , as measured by @xmath42 or @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath42 or @xmath97 deceases with increased metallicity .",
    "@xcite showed a different correlation of @xmath108 with [ fe / h ] for gcs in ngc 5128 , where @xmath108 is the half - mass radius , and reported that the correlation may be due to a selection effect because of a small sample .",
    "@xcite showed structural parameters as a function of [ fe / h ] for gcs in the mw , the magellanic clouds and fornax dwarf spheroidal , ngc 5128 , and m31 , and found that , no correlation of @xmath71 with [ fe / h ] exists ; a weak correlation of @xmath97 with [ fe / h ] is present : @xmath97 deceases with increased metallicity , except for gcs in ngc 5128 ; there is a slight systematic increase of @xmath78 with [ fe / h ] .",

    "it is evident that , the outer halo gcs of m31 fall in the same regions of parameter spaces of clusters in m31 and the mw .",
    "in addition , the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite do not change when adding the young massive clusters of @xcite and the outer halo gcs here .",
    "we also include four ecs of @xcite in the upper - right panel of figure 6 .",

    "the properties of clusters in m31 and the mw fall in the same regions of parameter spaces , with the exception that , on average , the young massive clusters have larger sizes and higher concentrations than older clusters of the same mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussions in detail ) .",
    "we also include four ecs of @xcite in the upper - right panel of figure 7 .",
    "three ecs have intermediate masses as well as the outer halo gcs of m31 studied here , while one ec ( hec12 ) has very low mass ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "@xcite showed structural parameters as a function of model luminosity for gcs in m31 , the mw , ngc 5128 , the magellanic clouds , and the fornax dsph , and found the properties of clusters in all six galaxies fall in the same regions of parameter spaces .",
    "the lower - right panel of figure 7 shows one view of the fundamental plane , as defined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a pair of bivariate correlations in mw gc parameters which imply the existence of a `` globular cluster fundamental plane '' , similar to that expected if the cores were virialized structures .",
    "@xcite found that the ngc 5128 gcs describe a relation between binding energy and luminosity that even tighter than in the mw , which occupy the same extremely narrow region of the parametric `` fundamental plane '' as do their mw counterparts .",
    "gcs in the outer halo of m31 have recently been discovered in many surveys .",
    "we selected ten gcs ( 15 kpc @xmath110 100 kpc ) which have been studied by @xcite based on the _ hst _",
    "observations used in this paper .",
    "we measured surface brightness profiles for them using the _ hst _ images of @xcite .",
    "structural and dynamical parameters were derived by fitting the king model to the light profiles .",
    "we discussed the properties of the sample gcs here combined with gcs in the mw @xcite and clusters in m31 @xcite . in general , the properties of the m31 and the galactic clusters fall in the same regions of parameter spaces .",
    "the outer halo gcs of m31 , which lie at large projected radii , have larger ellipticities than most of gcs in m31 and the mw .",
    "their large ellipticities may be due to galaxy tides coming from satellite dwarf galaxies of m31 or may be related to the apparently more vigorous accretion or merger history that m31 has experienced .",
    "however , this conclusion remains to be checked because of the sample limitation .",
    "rbc v4.0 provides 39 gcs and 87 gc candidates which lie at @xmath111 kpc . with more and more _ hst _ observations , structural and dynamical parameters for these clusters can be measured , which will provide a larger sample for discussion on the halo gcs .",
    "the strong correlation of @xmath0 with model mass @xmath1 indicates a tight fundamental plane both for m31 and galactic clusters , and no offset is apparent in the correlation between old and young clusters , especially including gcs in the outer halo of m31 studied here .",
    "this implies that some near - universal structural properties are present for clusters , regardless of their host environments , which is consistent with previous studies of @xcite .",
