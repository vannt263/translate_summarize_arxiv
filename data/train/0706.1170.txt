    "@xcite has been achieved in an optical lattice , pointing the way to future applications in quantum information processing .",
    "magnetic lattice potentials are a promising alternative to the widely used optical lattices that rely on intense overlapping laser beams .",
    "for instance , magnetic lattices produced using periodically magnetized films on atom chips provide a high degree of design flexibility allowing arbitrary trap geometries and lattice spacings  @xcite .",
    "the potentials are also magnetic state selective and only weak field seeking atoms remain trapped , allowing for manipulation using radio frequency ( rf ) fields - a powerful tool used extensively for forced evaporative cooling and for rf spectroscopy  @xcite . furthermore , magnetic lattices provide stable and tight confinement even with large separation between sites .",

    "we describe the design , fabrication and loading of a two - dimensional lattice of magnetic ( ioffe - pritchard ) microtraps for ultracold neutral atoms .",
    "the microtraps are produced near the surface of a patterned fept film with perpendicular magnetization .",
    "our magnetic lattice design consists of 1250 traps / mm@xmath0 , with the expectation that this density can be scaled up by two or three orders of magnitude .",
    "we describe the properties of the magnetic film and our fabrication of the structure . finally , we load a cloud of ultracold @xmath4rb atoms into this lattice , demonstrating that our approach is a feasible one .",

    "we show that ultracold @xmath4rb atoms can be transferred to the lattice from a z - shaped wire magnetic trap , to occupy more than 30 lattice sites .",
    "finally , we discuss some prospects for future experiments and in particular focus on quantum information processing using atom chips .",
    "we have considered several geometries for producing magnetic lattices and have chosen a single design that produces an array of microtraps with non - zero field minima , provides tight confinement to the atoms and can be loaded in a straight - forward way .",

    "as the magnetization is simply the sum of a number of discrete fourier components the magnetic field above the surface can be expressed analytically . for each fourier component with wavevector @xmath20 and for @xmath21 the magnetic scalar potential is given by : [ eqpot ] _",
    "( r)=i_eqc_nme^-kz ( ) . the magnetic field ( @xmath22 ) above the film surface can be approximated by taking @xmath23=\\{-1,0,1 } , leaving two terms : b_xb_y - b_z + where the approximation is valid for distances @xmath24 .",
    "each field component consist of two periodic terms with exponential prefactors which depend on @xmath5 and control the respective rate of decay of each fourier component from the film surface . for large distances from the film surface the first term with wave vector @xmath13 dominates and the field resembles that of a one - dimensional magnetic mirror potential  @xcite .",
    "closer to the surface the second term involving @xmath14 introduces additional structure to produce a two - dimensional periodic potential .    applying a uniform bias magnetic field oriented along",

    "our particular design has a length scale @xmath31 m , a magnetization of @xmath7  =  670  ka / m and a thickness of @xmath32  nm , corresponding to @xmath33  a. we calculate that a bias field of @xmath34mt results in cigar - shaped ioffe - pritchard traps , with their long axis predominantly oriented in the @xmath27-direction , positioned 10  @xmath1 m from the film surface  ( fig .

    "tighter radial confinement can also be achieved by partly cancelling the axial field strength . the barrier height between individual lattice sites",
    "can be tuned by varying @xmath25 to change the distance of the traps from the film surface .",
    "magnetic materials used for experiments with ultracold atoms and bose - einstein condensates should be magnetically hard with a magnetization sufficient to produce the field strength and gradients for providing tight confinement to the atoms  @xcite .",
    "they should also have a high coercivity in order to maintain the magnetization when subjected to externally applied fields .",
    "the magnetization should be oriented perpendicular to the film surface to give maximal design freedom and should be highly homogeneous to allow for intricate magnetic field designs and to avoid unwanted spatial variations of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "other desired properties include high corrosion resistance to facilitate lithographic patterning and good temperature stability especially during vacuum bake out .",
    "a suitable magnetic material for these experiments is fept  @xcite .",

    "ka / m and did not vary significantly for films of different thickness in the range 200 - 400  nm . , width=264 ]      we investigated two preparation methods for producing fept films .",
    "the first set was prepared at the hitachi san jose research center .",
    "the films are deposited on 300  @xmath1 m thick silicon substrates coated with approximately 10  nm of sin by magnetron sputter deposition at a temperature of @xmath38c .",
    "the films incorporate a 10  nm thick amorphous crti underlayer and a seed layer of 10  nm rual used to directly grow the fept in the fct phase in the ( 001 ) direction  @xcite .",
    "the fept layer itself was doped with a small amount ( @xmath3910 at.% ) of carbon to increase the remanent to saturation magnetization ratio .",
    "evidence for the textured nature of the film was obtained from x - ray diffraction spectra .",
    "the magnetization of the films were measured by vibrating sample magnetometry yielding a remanent magnetization of @xmath40  670  ka / m , a remanent to saturation magnetization ratio of @xmath41  0.93 and a coercivity of @xmath42  0.95  t. figure  [ fighitsquid ] shows a hysteresis curve of a 200  nm thick film .",
    "there were no significant differences between films of various thickness in the range 200 - 400  nm .    to test the suitability of our fept films for atom optics applications we magnetize and then bake the deposited films for 3 hours at 150  @xmath43c in air to characterize temperature stability .",
    "after baking the magnetization had reduced by @xmath44  3  @xmath45 .",
    "the films were also tested against demagnetization due to time varying magnetic fields .",
    "an experimental cycle typically involves external fields of up to 20  mt with a cycle time of about 30  s. to test the stability of the magnetization in those fields the films were magnetized and minor hysteresis loops were taken over the range of -20  mt to 20  mt .",
    "the magnetization did not measurably decrease after 15 cycles .",
    "additional long - term tests performed within the experimental apparatus also indicate the magnetization is stable during typical experimental cycles .",
    "we have also measured the surface roughness and grain size of the films using atomic force microscopy , scanning electron microscopy and x - ray diffraction .",
    "surface roughness can be a significant source of spatial magnetic field noise .",
    "the _ rms _ height variation in the film is @xmath44  6  nm . the grain size is related to the width of the x - ray diffraction peaks via the debye scherrer equation .",
    "this yields an average grain size of @xmath44  35  nm . taking these numbers into account",
    "we anticipate spatial magnetic field variations around 0.4  @xmath1 t which corresponds to energy variations between lattice sites of less than the vibrational level spacing ( @xmath39  6  khz )  @xcite .    as a second route to produce hard magnetic fept films we investigated the possibility of rapid post annealing of films magnetron sputtered directly onto silicon at lower temperatures ( 250@xmath46c ) .",
    "after deposition at this temperature the fept is in a highly disordered partly amorphous fcc soft magnetic phase .",
    "the film is annealed at a temperature of 450@xmath46c for 3  minutes in order to initiate the hard magnetic fct phase .",
    "this film had a remanent magnetization of @xmath40  580  ka / m , a remanent to saturation magnetization ratio of @xmath41  0.80 and a coercivity of @xmath42  0.95  t. although the magnetization is somewhat smaller than for the first film the post annealed film has the advantage that it has a smaller surface roughness ( 1  nm _ rms _ height variation ) and smaller grains ( @xmath44  20  nm diameter ) . furthermore , the annealed film is straightforward to produce without the complication of underlayers .",
    "it was however less stable against elevated temperatures and showed a 20  % decrease in magnetization after a 3 hour 150  @xmath43c bake , persuading us to use the hitachi film for the experiment .      to pattern our films we use optical lithography .",
    "we used a commercially obtained custom designed cr mask .",
    "this mask was patterned with a 442  nm hecd laser with a resolution of @xmath47 m .",
    "the deposited films are first spin coated with @xmath47 m optical resist and then illuminated for 4  s using a i - line ( 365 nm ) mask aligner . after developing the samples for one minute the resist on the illuminated parts of the sample",
    "is dissolved .",
    "the surface can be cleaned with a low power , two minute oxygen etch using a dry etching system .",
    "the exposed fept surface was then etched using an argon plasma for about 30  minutes .",
    "the remaining resist covering the chip structures was then removed in an ultrasonic bath .",
    "after this the chip was investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) . a sem image of the lattice is shown in fig .  [ figsem ] .",
    "finally , the magnetic films were coated with a 100  nm reflective gold over layer and were magnetized in a 5  t magnetic field .",
    "the completed atom chip consists of the silicon substrate with the patterned fept film epoxied to a copper mount which incorporates a wire structure used to load the microtraps  ( fig .",
    "[ figchipmount ] ) .",
    "in particular , the atom chip includes ( besides the fept film ) a u - shaped wire , a z - shaped wire and a small rf coil ( ten turns , diameter 5  mm ) used to apply radio frequency fields for forced evaporative cooling .",
    "the chip wires are @xmath48 m wide , have a height of @xmath49 m and are capable of running up to 15  a continuously without significant heating .",
    "the atom chip is mounted face - down in a glass cell vacuum chamber , surrounded by a system of three orthogonal pairs of coils for producing external fields  @xcite .",
    "laser cooled @xmath4rb atoms are transferred to the atom chip using techniques common to many atom chip experiments . after an initial cooling stage",
    "the atoms can be transferred to the magnetic lattice potential .",
    "the following section describes the loading process .    .",
    "in ( b ) the current in the z - wire is turned down , moving the cloud closer to the surface and the potential gets corrugated by the lattice . in ( c ) the current is completely turned off and the atoms are trapped in the lattice sites .",
    "we also show the orientation of the probe beam used to make the absorption images shown in fig  [ figlattice].,width=226 ]      we collect approximately @xmath50 @xmath4rb atoms in a mirror magneto optical trap ( mmot ) 4  mm from the chip surface .",
    "this mmot relies on a quadrupole magnetic field ( 0.1  t / m ) produced by a pair of external coils overlapped with four laser beams with appropriate detuning and polarizations .",
    "the atoms are transferred closer to the chip by passing 5.5  a through the u - shaped wire , applying a bias field of @xmath51  mt , and ramping off the external magnetic quadrupole field .",
    "this u - mot has a field gradient of 0.2  t / m . to further cool the atoms a 4  ms polarisation gradient cooling stage",
    "is applied by detuning the trap laser below resonance by 36  mhz and rapidly reducing the u - wire current and bias field by a factor of three to weaken the field gradient .",
    "we found that this stage significantly improves the loading efficiency into the magnetic trap . to magnetically trap the atoms a 0.2  ms optical pumping pulse in a uniform",
    "magnetic field drives the atoms to the @xmath52 state .",
    "then the u - wire current is reduced to zero , the z - wire current is increased to 12  a and the bias field @xmath25 is increased to 1.4  mt to produce an ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap containing @xmath53 atoms .",
    "we then adiabatically compress the trap by increasing the z - wire current to 15  a and by increasing @xmath25 to 4.0  mt .",
    "the calculated radial and axial trap frequencies are @xmath54  hz and @xmath55  hz respectively .",
    "the mean elastic collision rate is @xmath56  s@xmath57 .",
    "forced rf evaporative cooling is applied by a programmable dds rf synthesiser via a 2  w rf amplifier to the built - in rf coil .",
    "the evaporation stage consists of three linear rf sweeps : from 15  mhz to 6  mhz in 2.5  s , from 6  mhz to 3  mhz in 1.5  s and from 3  mhz to the final evaporation frequency of 520  khz in a further 2  s. to improve the evaporation efficiency we also compress the z - wire trap further after the first sweep by increasing @xmath25 to 5.0  mt which pushes the trap closer to the surface and increases the radial trap frequency to @xmath58  hz . for a final radio frequency of 545  khz",
    "the cloud temperature reaches the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) temperature ( @xmath59k ) with approximately @xmath60  atoms .",
    "the bec transition is accompanied by the onset of a bimodal density distribution and anisotropy in the time of flight expansion . continuing the rf sweep to 520  khz we produce an almost pure bec containing 6000  atoms .      to load atoms to the lattice we truncate the rf sweep at a final frequency of 800  khz to produce a cold thermal cloud of @xmath61  atoms at an estimated temperature of @xmath62k .",
    "we load the lattice with a thermal cloud rather than a bose - einstein condensate to ensure each lattice site contains a sufficient number of atoms for detection and to minimise the influence of heating during loading .",
    "we expect that further rf evaporation could be performed after loading with high efficiency due to the extremely tight confinement in individual lattice sites .",
    "loading the lattice is rather straightforward as the magnetic field produced by each lattice site is by design oriented in the same direction as that produced by the z - shaped wire . in this way we can simply reduce the z - wire current to zero , pushing the trapped atoms closer to the surface and finally into the lattice potential .",
    "the atoms are imaged using a resonant probe laser aligned along @xmath28 with a small inclination ( @xmath63 ) with respect to the chip surface to produce a reflection image .",
    "reflection imaging allows us to image atom clouds in close proximity to the chip surface and to determine the height of the cloud .",
    "one disadvantage however is that the absorption signal is integrated along the @xmath9direction .    in the experiment",
    "we reduce the z - wire current from 15  a to zero over 50  ms to move the trap closer to the fept film . for a z - wire current of 2",
    "a the cloud expands in the axial direction , moves to approximately @xmath64 m from the fept surface and becomes clearly corrugated by the lattice potential , as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figchipmount ] . further decreasing the z - wire current to zero transfers all of the atoms to the magnetic lattice ( fig .",
    "[ figlattice ] ) .",
    "the spacing between lattice sites determined from an absorption image of the cloud is @xmath64 m , as expected from the lattice geometry .",
    "the overall gaussian density distribution is due to the initial distribution of atoms in the z - wire trap and does not expand further after loading .",
    "we observe a minimum of 30 occupied lattice sites spanning @xmath65 m along @xmath27 but the true number of occupied sites may be higher",
    ". a better estimate of the number of occupied lattice sites may be obtained in the future by inclining the probe beam further to resolve the lattice structure along the @xmath9axis .",
    "assuming adiabatic compression during loading we expect the individual atom clouds to be localized , each at a temperature of @xmath49k , smaller than the inter - well barrier height and trap depth ( @xmath66  mk ) .",
    "we observe a lifetime of more than 1  s for the atoms trapped in the lattice potential .",

    "the present density of lattice sites is 1250 traps / mm@xmath0",
    ". it should be feasible to scale down the linear dimensions of our structure into the ( sub-)micron range and thus increase the trap density by two or three orders of magnitude .",
    "we are presently investigating the possibilities to drive single and two - qubit gate operations @xcite .",
    "we plan to directly address individual sites by a combination of static and radio frequency or microwave fields , to selectively change the internal state of the atoms .",
    "an important parameter for the optical manipulation of the qubits is the confinement of the atoms on the scale of the optical wavelength .",
    "the present confinement is already sufficiently tight for the trap ground state to be in the so - called lamb - dicke limit , where the photon recoil energy is less than the vibrational level splitting .",
    "further downscaling in size should make the confinement even tighter , and thus decrease the lamb - dicke parameter .",
