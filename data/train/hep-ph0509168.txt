    "search for supersymmetric particles at colliders usually proceeds from the assumption that all of them are relatively heavy ( few hundreds of gev ) and short - living .",
    "being heavier than the standard model particles they usually decay faster and result in usual particles with additional missing energy and momenta coming from the escaping neutral lsp .",
    "this is true almost in all regions of parameter space of the mssm and for various mechanisms of susy breaking  @xcite .",
    "there exists , however , some corner in parameter space with small @xmath6 and large @xmath7 in msugra conventions where the lsp is not the usual neutralino , but a slepton ( mainly stau ) .",
    "this corner is obviously considered as a forbidden region since the charged lsp would contradict the astrophysical observations : no charged clouds of stable particles are observed . at the border of this region stau becomes heavier than neutralino and thus unstable .",
    "it then decays very fast .",
    "this is just this narrow region in parameter space that attracts our attention in this paper .",
    "this region is usually called the co - annihilation region since neutralinos and staus are almost degenerate here and in the early universe they would annihilate and co - annihilate resulting in a proper amount of the dark matter defined by these annihilation and co - annihilation cross - sections .",
    "we found out that in the narrow band near the co - annihilation region sleptons might be rather stable with the lifetime long enough to go through the detector . due to a relatively small mass ( 150 @xmath1 850 gev )",
    "their production cross - section at lhc may reach few % pb .",
    "this possibility is investigated in detail .",
    "the analysis is close to what has been studied mainly in the framework of models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "also , we have to mention that searches for long - lived particles were made by lep collaborations  @xcite .",
    "in the framework of the mssm with supergravity inspired soft susy breaking one has in general more than a hundred unknown parameters . to reduce their",
    "number one usually makes a number of simplifying assumptions , one of the favourite being the universality hypothesis .",
    "then one has basically a set of 5 parameters : @xmath8 and @xmath0",
    ". they may be further constrained .",
    "one of the strictest constraints is the gauge couplings unification , it fixes the threshold of supersymmetry breaking @xmath9 tev  @xcite .",
    "the second very hard constraint follows from the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite , which correlates the value of @xmath10 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , leaving only the sign of @xmath10 free .",
    "further constraints are due to flavour changing processes like @xmath11 responsible for the rare @xmath12-meson decays  @xcite , anomalous magnetic moment of muon which allows only a positive sign of @xmath10  @xcite , experimental limits on the higgs boson mass  @xcite , and on the masses of susy particles  @xcite .",
    "recent very precise data from the wmap collaboration , which measured thermal fluctuations of cosmic microwave background radiation and restricted the amount of the dark matter in the universe up to @xmath13  @xcite , result in a very hard constraint on soft susy parameters .",
    "conservation of @xmath14-parity results in the existence of the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "usually it is neutralino @xmath15 , the mixture of superpartners of neutral gauge bosons - photino and zino and neutral higgsinos , the superpartners of higges .",
    "the precise content of neutralino depends on the choice of parameters .",
    "however , it might be also a superpartner of lepton , mainly stau . to exclude this possibility one imposes further constrains on parameter space .",
    "it is just this lsp constraint that we are interested in here .",
    "it is shown qualitatively in fig.[region ] , and is usually called the co - annihilation region  @xcite . the dark triangle shows the region where stau is the lsp . to the right of it",
    "neutralino is the lsp .",
    "the wmap constraint leaves a very narrow band in the @xmath16 plane . in this region",
    ", it goes along the lsp triangle border and is shown qualitatively as a straight line in fig.[region ] .",
    "though the boundary of the lsp region with the wmap allowed band is very narrow , its position depends on the value of @xmath0 . in fig.[lsp ] we show how the lsp triangle increases with @xmath0 .",
    "hence , even if it is very difficult to get precisely into this narrow band , changing @xmath0 one actually sweeps up a wide area .",
    "this boundary region happens to be a transition region from stau - lsp to neutralino - lsp . in a very narrow interval",
    "the lifetime of stau rapidly changes from infinity to almost zero passing the tiny interval ( smeared by the change of @xmath0 ) where stau is a long - lived particle .",
    "we consider this interval below to see how it changes with @xmath0 and the other parameters and how this influences the lifetime of sleptons .",
    "when the mass of stau becomes bigger that the neutralino one , it decays . the only decay mode in this region in case of conservation of the r - parity is @xmath17 the life time crucially depends on the mass difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and quickly decreases while departing from the boundary line .",
    "if we neglect mixing in the stau sector , then the nlsp is the @xmath20 and the decay width is given by  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the elements of the matrix diagonalizing the neutralino mass matrix .    in fig.[life ] , we show the lifetime of stau as a function of @xmath6 for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath0 calculated with the help of the isajet v7.67 code  @xcite .",
    "one can see that a small deviation from the border line results in immediate fall down of the lifetime . to get reasonable lifetimes of the order of @xmath24 sec so that particles can go through the detector one needs to be almost exactly at the borderline .",
    "however , the border line itself is not fixed , it moves with @xmath0 .",
    "we show below ( fig.[width ] ) in the same way the width of stau as function of @xmath6 for various values of @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "one can see , it rapidly approaches zero near the border line .",
    "consider now how these long - lived staus can be produced at lhc .",
    "the main process is given by a quark - antiquark annihilation channel shown in fig.[prod ] .",
    "to calculate the mass of stau and the production cross - section , we choose the benchmark points at the lsp borderline for various values of @xmath25 .",
    "they are summarized below    .",
    "the neutralino lsp borderline benchmark points ( in gev ) as calculated by isajet v7.67 [ bench ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at each point we calculated the values of stau mass and the cross - section for stau production at lhc at the center of mass energy equal to 14 tev . for this purpose we used the calchep 3.2 code  @xcite , which takes into account the parton distributions inside protons . for our purposes we took the mrst  @xcite parton distribution functions .",
    "the results are presented in table [ res ] below .",
    "two cross - sections correspond to the pair production of staus and single production accompanied by sneutrino , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "we show the plot for both the cross - sections as a function of @xmath6 for various values of @xmath0 in fig.[cross ] .",
    "one can see that for a small stau mass , which corresponds to the left bottom corner of @xmath26 plane , the cross sections are relatively large for staus to be produced at lhc with the luminosity around 100 pb@xmath27",
    ". they may well be long - lived and go through the detector , though the precise lifetime is very sensitive to the parameter space point and , hence , can not be predicted with high accuracy .",
    "still this leaves a very interesting possibility of production of a heavy charged long - lived spinless particle .",
    "we have shown that within the framework of the mssm with msugra supersymmetry breaking mechanism in principle there exists an interesting possibility to get long - lived sleptons which might be produced at lhc in annihilation channels .",
    "the cross - section crucially depends on a single parameter  the stau mass and for light staus can reach a few % pb .",
    "this might be within the reach of lhc .",
    "such a process would have an unusual signature if heavy staus could indeed go through the detector and decay with a considerable delay .",
    "this situation differs from that in the gauge - mediated susy breaking scenario where the lifetime of nlsp is typically much larger  @xcite .",
