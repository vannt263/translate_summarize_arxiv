    "plateau s celebrated study @xcite of the stability of bodies under the influence of surface tension established a fundamental result of classical continuum mechanics : a cylinder longer than its circumference is energetically unstable to breakup . here",
    "we consider a quantum mechanical generalization of plateau s study  the stability of a metallic nanowire .",
    "methods from the study of quantum chaos @xcite are used to examine the energetics of a free electron gas in a cylindrical jellium filament , and show that an infinite filament can be stable against all axisymmetric perturbations if its electrical conductance @xmath0 [ in units of @xmath1 belongs to a set of  magic numbers \" @xmath2 and is otherwise unstable . here",
    "@xmath3 is the charge of an electron and @xmath4 is planck s constant .",
    "such magic numbers are analogous to those found in the shell model of atomic nuclei @xcite and in metal clusters @xcite .",
    "our stability analysis elucidates and confirms the stability properties of simple metal nanowires conjectured by yanson , yanson , and van ruitenbeek @xcite based on their observation of shell structure in the conductance statistics of sodium nanowires .",
    "structural multistability of metallic nanowires was previously postulated based on classical molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the magic numbers observed in conductance histograms in alkali metals @xcite are clearly an electronic shell effect , as shown below , and can not be explained with classical molecular dynamics .",
    "the common occurence of multistability in two such radically different models likely stems from the fact that both models introduce an additional length scale ( the fermi wavelength @xmath5 in the free electron model , the atomic diameter in molecular dynamics simulations ) , which leads to commensurability effects .",
    "the properties of nanowires formed from simple monovalent metals , like the bulk properties of these materials @xcite , are determined largely by the delocalized conduction electrons .",
    "a free electron jellium model , treating the electrons as a noninteracting fermi gas confined within the wire by hard - wall boundary conditions , provides an intuitive and even quantitative explanation of observed quantities like conductance @xcite , force @xcite , and shot noise @xcite . to examine energetic stability",
    ", we consider a weakly deformed cylinder , and find its thermodynamic potential to quadratic order in the amplitude of the deformation .",
    "a contribution proportional to the filament area , naturally identified as the surface tension , is only one of several competing terms in the free energy , which consists of terms which vary smoothly with the geometry of the filament and an oscillatory contribution directly connected with the discrete energy levels that are solutions to schrdinger s equation .",
    "the smooth terms appear in descending powers of length ( proportional to volume , surface area , mean curvature , etc . ) , and are quite analogous to those found in the study of classical wave equations in curved domains @xcite and the related problem of classically screened coulomb ( debye - hckel ) interactions of curved surfaces in an electrolyte @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory part of the free energy , in particular , alters plateau s classical stability analysis in an essential way .",
    "the present work is thus fundamentally distinct from that which has dealt with the quantum mechanical origin of surface tension itself in metallic fluids @xcite , as well as those which consider quantum mechanical corrections to classical surface tension due to the quantization of capillary waves @xcite .",
    "long gold nanowires suspended between gold electrodes have been produced and imaged with a transmission electron microscope by kondo and takayanagi @xcite ; in particular , they have observed wires which are stable and almost perfectly cylindrical .",
    "the wires of ref .",
    "@xcite are of finite length , and attached to electrodes at either end .",
    "it seems reasonable to consider an infinite wire as a theoretical starting point , and to assume that the length of the wire acts as a cut - off : deformations with a wavelength longer than the wire length can not occur .",
    "thus one does not have to model the boundary conditions at the ends of the wire , which would introduce additional parameters .    to be specific ,",
    "we examine an infinite cylindrical wire and its sole classically unstable deformation  an axially symmetric one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_deformation ] ) .",
    "any such deformation can be written as a fourier series : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius at position @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the unperturbed radius , @xmath10 is the ( infinitesimal ) perturbation coefficient , and @xmath11 is an arbitrary phase shift .",
    "the coefficients @xmath10 are chosen such that the total volume of the wire is unchanged by the deformation .",
    "other physically reasonable constraints @xcite are also possible , but lead to similar results .",
    "= 3.5truein    the metallic nanowire is an open system , connected to macroscopic metallic electrodes at each end @xcite .",
    "therefore the change of the grand canonical potential @xmath12 under the perturbation determines its stability .",
    "@xmath12 is related to the electronic density of states @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath16 is the temperature , and @xmath17 is the electronic chemical potential specified by the macroscopic electrodes .",
    "our aim is to expand @xmath12 up to second order in the coefficients @xmath10 characterizing the deformation . as we will show , this yields @xmath18=\\omega[0]+\\int_0^\\infty\\!\\ !",
    "dq\\ , \\alpha(q ) [ b(q)]^2 + { \\cal{o}}(b^3)~.\\ ] ] the change in the grand canonical potential is of second order in @xmath19 and contributions from deformations with different @xmath20 decouple .",
    "if the prefactor @xmath21 is negative for any value of @xmath20 , then @xmath12 decreases under the deformation and the wire is unstable .",
    "= 4truein    for an infinite cylindrical wire , the transverse motion is quantized , leading to the formation of discrete electronic subbands .",
    "the total density of states is the sum of the contributions from each subband ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : every subband begins to contribute at a threshold energy equal to the energy of its quantized transverse motion with a sharp spike , falling off smoothly for increasing energy .",
    "if the fermi energy @xmath22 lies near one of these sharp peaks , certain small deformations of the wire can dramatically increase the density of states . according to ( [ omega_als_fkt_v_g ] ) , this lowers the grand canonical potential , leading to an instability . on the other hand , if there is no subband threshold sufficiently close to @xmath22 , the density of states will instead decrease with any deformation , implying the existence of stable regions intervening between the instabilities associated with the opening of each subband .",
    "in order to examine this picture quantitatively , we use a semiclassical approach @xcite , which enables @xmath13 to be split into a smooth average contribution @xmath23 , referred to as the _ weyl contribution _ , and an oscillatory part @xmath24 , whose average value is zero : @xmath25 the weyl term @xmath26 contains terms proportional to the volume of the nanowire , and to the area and curvature of its surface : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the fermi wavevector . the volume @xmath30 , surface area @xmath31 , and integrated mean curvature @xmath32 can be calculated for arbitrary perturbations by simple geometric considerations .",
    "the oscillatory part @xmath33 of the density of states is a quantum correction , and may be calculated in the semiclassical approximation as a sum over all periodic classical orbits of the system @xcite .",
    "let us first consider an undeformed cylindrical wire .",
    "each periodic orbit lies in a plane transverse to the wire s axis , and there is a correspondence to the orbits @xcite in a circular billiard ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_orbits ] ) .",
    "note that the action @xmath34 of each orbit is invariant under both translations of the orbit parallel to the @xmath8-axis and rotations about the @xmath8-axis . in a system with continuous symmetries ,",
    "when taking the trace of the electron green s function to calculate the density of states , one must first integrate exactly over these symmetries @xcite before employing the semiclassical ( stationary phase ) approximation . for electrons in a cylinder of length @xmath35 ,",
    "one obtains the following trace formula @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron mass , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig_orbits ] , @xmath40 counts the discrete degeneracy of the orbit under time reversal , @xmath41 is the length of a periodic orbit , and the action @xmath42 .",
    "= 3.5truein    when the wire is deformed , the translational symmetry is broken , and we use a semiclassical perturbation theory @xcite to calculate @xmath33 .",
    "this theory assumes that for small perturbations , the amplitudes and topology of the unperturbed orbits can still be used in ( [ dos_gutz ] ) , but that the lengths of the orbits  and hence their actions  change .",
    "the trace formula becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 which may be expressed in terms of the perturbation coefficients using eq.([eq : rofz ] ) . combining this result for @xmath33 with ( [ dos_weyl ] ) , it is straightforward to calculate the density of states up to second order in the coefficients @xmath10 for a deformed wire .",
    "the result can be integrated to obtain the grand canonical potential , which indeed has the expansion ( [ exp_omega ] ) .",
    "let us first discuss the stability of a nanowire at zero temperature . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the stability coefficient @xmath46 ( lower diagram ) and the density of states at the fermi energy ( upper diagram ) as functions of the radius of the unperturbed wire .",
    "the wavelength of the perturbation was taken to be @xmath47 , the critical wavelength for stability in plateau s classical analysis of a body under the influence of surface tension .",
    "in addition to surface tension , the present model for @xmath12 has a curvature energy , which enhances the instability for small @xmath9 , and an oscillatory component associated with the opening of successive subbands as @xmath9 increases . as discussed above",
    ", @xmath46 has sharp negative peaks  indicating strong instabilities  at the subband thresholds , where the density of states is sharply peaked . under surface tension and curvature energy alone ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the wire would be slightly unstable at the critical wavevector @xmath47 , since the curvature term is negative .",
    "however , the quantum correction is positive in the regions between the thresholds to open new subbands , _ thus stabilizing the wire_. since the oscillatory contribution to @xmath46 is independent of @xmath20 , we find that regions of stability persist for _ arbitrarilly long wavelength perturbations _ , indicating that an infinitely long cylindrical wire is a true metastable state if the radius lies in one of the windows of stability .    with these results , we can construct the zero temperature stability diagram for the wire [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "in contrast to plateau s classical stability analysis , an additional quantum length scale arises here , namely the fermi wavelength @xmath5 .",
    "the stability problem is now determined by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , regions of instability , where the coefficient @xmath21 is negative , are shaded grey , while the stable regions are shown in white .",
    "note that many of the white regions of stability persist all the way down to @xmath50 .",
    "the _ multistability _ of the system , indicated by the alternating stable and unstable stripes , reflects commensurability effects between @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "we remark that in addition to the axially symmetric modes considered here , which are the sole unstable modes in the classical limit , perturbations which break axial symmetry may also become unstable near the subband thresholds . however , these jahn - teller like modes @xcite are likely less unstable than the axisymmetric modes , and will not destroy the regions of stability shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the electrical conductance @xmath0 of a perfect cylindrical nanowire is quantized @xcite in units of @xmath51 .",
    "the quantized conductance values of the stable cylindrical configurations are indicated by bold numerals in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . for comparison ,",
    "the right vertical axis of the figure is labeled with the corrected sharvin conductance @xcite @xmath52 which gives a smooth approximation to @xmath53 .",
    "the conductance values of the stable configurations are somewhat analogous to the _ magic numbers _ of enhanced stability in atomic nuclei @xcite and metal clusters @xcite .",
    "an important distinction is that the magic numbers in nuclei and clusters refer to the number of fermions in a finite system , while we consider an infinite , open system , with magic numbers describing the number of conducting transverse modes @xcite which hold the wire together .",
    "the number of conducting modes is approximately equal to the number of atoms which fit within a cross section of the wire .",
    "the integer magic numbers identified here must be distinguished from the concept of `` magic wire configurations '' proposed by van ruitenbeek and others @xcite .",
    "the latter represented discrete minima of the energy per unit volume of a jellium wire as a function of its cross - sectional area , but the stability with respect to deformations with @xmath54 was not considered .",
    "a similar scenario was advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite based on a partial summation of the periodic orbits in the expression for @xmath12 itself . while the theoretical results of refs .",
    "@xcite seem to imply that stability occurs only for a discrete set of radii , of measure zero , our analysis finds stability with respect to small perturbations over broad intervals of radius .",
    "furthermore , the very existence of discrete energetic minima of the type discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite depends sensitively on the numerical value of the surface tension in the model ; for example , they do not occur whatsoever in the free - electron model at constant volume for @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast , the finite windows of stability in our analysis are robust with respect to variations of the surface tension .",
    "the sequence of magic numbers @xmath56 is consistent with the observation of conductance quantization in alkali metal point contacts @xcite .",
    "recently , conductance histograms for sodium nanowires with pronounced peaks up to @xmath57 were obtained by yanson _",
    "they argued that these peaks could not be understood based on conductance quantization alone , but rather reflected energetically preferred wire configurations . in order to construct a theoretical conductance histogram",
    ", we need to know the _ a priori probability _ of occurence of a nanowire of a given cross - sectional area . here",
    ", we make the simplest hypothesis : that _ nanowires of different cross - sectional areas occur with equal a priori probability if stable , and with zero probability otherwise_. on this hypothesis , the relative probability of observing a contact with a given quantized conductance value is proportional to the width @xmath58 of the corresponding stable region , @xmath59 being a dimensionless measure of the contact area .",
    "the conductance histogram from ref .",
    "@xcite taken at a temperature of @xmath60 is reproduced in our fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . for comparison ,",
    "the theoretical magic numbers at the same temperature are plotted as vertical bars , with height equal to the width @xmath58 of the corresponding stable region . unlike the idealized wires in our analysis , the experimental wires are of finite length , and contain imperfections . thus the peaks in the experimental histogram are shifted @xcite below the theoretical integer values due to backscattering , and are broadened @xcite due to tunneling , disorder - induced conductance fluctuations , and inelastic processes .",
    "furthermore , the relative heights of the peaks may be influenced by dynamical as well as energetic effects ; in particular , the peak at @xmath61 , which is quite pronounced at the lowest temperatures @xcite , is absent from the experimental histogram at @xmath60presumably indicating that thermally activated processes lead to the rupture of this metastable configuration .",
    "= 4.0truein    while the first four theoretical peaks at @xmath62 can be identified unambiguously with the narrower peaks in the low temperature data of refs .",
    "@xcite , it is not entirely clear whether one can match up the broad peaks in the 80k experimental histogram with individual theoretical magic numbers . in particular , there appears to be fine structure in the theoretical histogram which is not present in the 80k histogram , possibly because it is obscured due to broadening . in order to see whether the theoretical histogram nonetheless correctly describes the gross features of the experimental histogram , it is useful to take the fourier transforms of the two histograms , singling out the contributions of the shortest periodic orbits .",
    "the actions of the periodic orbits are proportional to the radius of the wire , and hence are approximately proportional to the square root of the conductance , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sharvin ] ) .",
    "the contributions of the various periodic orbits to the conductance histogram can thus be extracted @xcite by taking a fourier transform with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "the fourier power spectrum of the theoretical conductance histogram is shown as a solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , where all magic numbers up to @xmath64 were included .",
    "it shows clear peaks corresponding to the three shortest periodic orbits . for comparison , the experimental fourier spectrum for sodium nanowires at 90k obtained by yanson _",
    "@xcite is shown as a dashed curve .",
    "the experimental spectrum contains two broad peaks , one centered at the frequency of the diameter orbit , and a second which spans the frequencies of the triangle and square orbits .",
    "the experimental peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) are broader than the theoretical peaks since the oscillatory structure in the experimental histogram is damped for @xmath65 .",
    "the widths of the theoretical peaks , in contrast , are determined by the maximum conductance included , @xmath66 ; increasing this cutoff decreases the widths of the peaks .",
    "we have simply taken a cutoff larger than the maximum measured conductance , so that the cutoff does not introduce any artifacts in the theoretical fourier spectrum .",
    "the overall vertical scale of the power spectra shown is arbitrary , so a comparison between theory and experiment must be based on the relative spectral weights of the various peaks . in both spectra ,",
    "the weight of the diameter orbit is roughly half the combined spectral weights of the triangle and square orbits  a rather good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "at zero temperature , the pattern of stable regions separated by unstable stripes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) continues up to arbitrarilly large radii . however , at any finite temperature @xmath16 , the quantum oscillations in @xmath46 are smoothed out , and the classical stability criterion @xmath67 is recovered asymptotically for sufficiently large radii .",
    "the crossover from the @xmath68 result to the classical limit occurs when @xmath69 , i.e. , when the thermal energy @xmath70 is comparable to the average transverse level spacing .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows the stability diagram for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the fermi temperature .",
    "one sees that the stability boundary indeed begins to cross over to the classical line @xmath47 for @xmath73 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , there are no true metastable configurations with @xmath74 , indicating that all thicker wires would be dynamically unstable ( like a column of fluid ) at this temperature , once the electronic shell effects have been smoothed out .",
    "however , @xmath75 in sodium , so multistability from electronic shell effects can be expected to occur in sodium contacts with @xmath76 up to at least 300k .",
    "it should be pointed out that thermal averaging is not the only mechanism which can suppress electronic shell effects .",
    "disorder also tends to smooth out the sharply peaked structure in the density of states , so that one can expect a reduction of shell effects when the diameter of the wire exceeds the mean free path .",
    "furthermore , the tendency of the positive ions to order themselves into regular arrays @xcite will certainly affect the stability of metallic nanowires .",
    "indeed , pioneering theoretical investigations @xcite of the dynamics of nanowires focused exclusively on the arrangement of the ions . based on the relative importance of electronic shells and crystal structure in metal clusters @xcite",
    ", one would expect electronic shell effects to dominate the energetics of very thin wires , particularly in the alkali metals , with crystal structure becoming increasingly important for thicker wires , and for metals where the bonding is more directional .",
    "although conductance histograms of gold nanowires @xcite do not exhibit the sequence of magic numbers predicted here and observed in alkali metals , there is some evidence that gold nanowires can otherwise be adequately described using the free electron model @xcite .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to speculate about a possible electronic origin for the remarkable stability of wires of individual gold atoms .",
    "linear chains composed of four to seven gold atoms suspended between two gold electrodes , with a conductance @xmath61 , were found to be stable in the laboratory for hours at a time @xcite .",
    "given that such a configuration has an enormous surface energy , its stability is at first sight surprising .",
    "however , in our free electron model , we find that an infinitely long wire with a conductance of @xmath77 is indeed stable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "our results may also be relevant to explain the observed stability of gold wires with larger radii @xcite .",
    "the atomic - scale structure of these wires exhibits a remarkable diversity , ranging from helical , multishell structures @xcite to crystalline structures with surface reconstruction @xcite ; but a common factor in the observed stable structures is that they are almost perfectly cylindrical .",
    "a direct comparison to our theoretical stability analysis would be facilitated by measurements of the conductance of the stable wires , which have not yet been carried out .",
    "however , a rule of thumb is that the conductance @xmath53 of a metal wire made of monovalent atoms is roughly equal to the number of atoms in the cross section . thus the hexagonal prism structure with a cross section of 30 atoms determined in ref .",
    "@xcite does correspond to a stable configuration in our analysis [ vertical bar at @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] . similarly ,",
    "the thinnest of the helical wire structures determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a cross section of 8 atoms , also corresponds to a stable structure in our analysis , while the two thickest wire structures determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , with cross sections of 22 and 24 atoms , respectively , appear to straddle the predicted island of stability at @xmath79 .",
    "further work is needed to elucidate the interplay of atomistic stacking effects and electronic shell effects in these structures .",
    "finally , let us comment on the dynamical evolution of a nanowire under elongation or compression .",
    "consider stretching a nanowire that is initially in a stable configuration ( white areas in fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "under elongation , the radius of the wire decreases , so that one moves downward on the stability diagram . when a stability boundary is encountered , it becomes energetically ( and dynamically ) favorable for the wire to deform spontaneously , until another stable configuration of smaller radius is reached , thus causing the conductance to jump abruptly from one magic number to a smaller one , and conversely under compression .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the claim @xcite that the structure of a metallic nanowire undergoes a sequence of abrupt changes as a function of elongation or compression .",
    "the finite widths of the unstable tongues in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also provides a possible explanation for the hysteresis @xcite observed in the conductance as a function of elongation : the critical radius at which the wire s conductance jumps between neighboring magic numbers is different , depending on whether the tongue is approached from above or below , i.e. , depending on whether the wire is stretched or compressed .",
