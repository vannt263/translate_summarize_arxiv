    "emission from interstellar dust comprises a wide - ranging portion of the overall energy budget in galaxies , ranging from typically a few percent for ellipticals ( xilouris et al .",
    "2004 ) , to tens of percent for normal star - forming galaxies ( dale et al . 2000 ) , to greater than 95 percent for many ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( soifer et al .",
    "1984 ) . to take advantage of this energetically - important view of galaxies , many current and planned instruments are pushing infrared , submillimeter , and millimeter astronomy into new sensitivity regimes .",
    "increasingly deep cosmological surveys carried out at these long wavelengths are already revealing a rich diversity of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at every redshift ( e.g. yan et al .",
    "2004 ; rowan - robinson et al .",
    "2005 ) . in order to exploit these surveys to their full potential",
    ", it is paramount to empirically characterize the details of individual galaxy infrared seds and their broad characteristics for a diverse sample of galaxies .",
    "the 75 galaxies studied in detail in the sings legacy science program represent a fair sampling of the range of galaxies found in the local universe ( kennicutt et al .",
    "the suite of _ spitzer space telescope _ cosmology surveys , on the other hand , will produce vast catalogs of infrared - bright sources at much larger distances .",
    "tremendous advances in the understanding of galaxy infrared seds could potentially be made with such huge catalogs .",
    "however , due to sensitivity and confusion limitations , these surveys will not constrain the far - infrared fluxes for most sources ( the initial swire catalog has detections at 70 and 160  for only 0.7% of its sources with photometric redshifts ; rowan - robinson et al .",
    "2005 ) , whereas most sings targets will have robust detections at near- , mid- , and far - infrared wavelengths in addition to submillimeter data for a third of the sample .",
    "in other words , though it only comprises 75 targets , the broad multi - wavelength coverage for the sings sample should enable unique advances in sed understanding .",
    "in addition , inferring a galaxy s total infrared luminosity from just 24  or 24 + 70  measurements alone would be useful to cosmology surveys , and the collection of sings seds make it possible to calibrate these extrapolations and quantify the uncertainties involved .",
    "finally , another important advantage to the sings sample lies in its proximity .",
    "the unprecedented combination of  sensitivity and angular resolution , coupled with the nearness of the sings targets , will enable us to learn about differences in the infrared seds as a function of the local ( sub - kpc to kpc ) environment .",
    "the various cosmological efforts being pursued via the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ will profit from this compilation of sings infrared spectra .",
    "the focus of this study is to make a preliminary exploration of the broad variations of sings 1 - 850  seds using both globally - integrated data and data stemming from smaller spatial scales within galaxies .",
    "a complementary study of sings infrared spectra will concentrate on a narrower wavelength range to quantify the variations observed in the mid - infrared spectral shapes .",

    "were removed and then the data were calibrated , grouped according to chop throw and angle , and regridded .",

    "we add a random component to the mips fluxes , gaussian - scaled by the fluxes uncertainties .",

    "the dotted curve is the 900  myr continuous star formation , solar metallicity , salpeter imf ( @xmath9 ) curve from vazquez & leitherer ( 2005 ) fitted to the 2mass fluxes . though our current approach is mostly illustrative and avoids a more sophisticated suite of multi - parameter dust and stellar models , it is remarkable how well the data are generally fit by such a simple combination .",
    "note that for a few galaxies the far - infrared emission appears to peak at a wavelength that is slightly longer than that in the most quiescent dust model ( i.e. @xmath10 ) .",
    "the dust - only models will be updated , and a more refined approach will be pursued for the stellar profiles , once all the sings data are in hand .",
    "finally , we note that the mid - infrared data for ngc  1377 are quite discrepant from the model predicted by the far - infrared fluxes .",
    "roussel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that ngc  1377 is in the initial throes of an intense starburst , and that this heavily extincted system is being observed at such an early stage of the star formation that it is yet to show any optical signatures or synchrotron radiation .",

    "( in preparation ) .    information on our collection of infrared spectra can be more compactly displayed in a single sed plot and in an infrared color - color diagram .",
    "the examples presented in figure  [ fig : seds_sample ] portray the variety of spectral shapes in the sings sample . arbitrarily normalizing the spectra at 8.0  emphasizes the significant dispersion in the sample s near - infrared / mid - infrared and far - infrared / mid - infrared colors .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : global_colors ] shows the ( dust - only ) mid - infrared color as a function of the far - infrared color .",
    "the stellar contribution is subtracted from the 8.0 and 24  measures via extrapolation of the 3.6  emission , assuming the 3.6  emission is completely stellar : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are chosen such that the dust - only flux densities vanish for a standard stellar spectrum ( e.g. helou et al .",
    "2004 ; engelbracht et al .",
    "2005 ) . likewise , the ratio of 8.0  dust emission to _ total _ dust emission is plotted in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : global_colors ] using the relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 and the denominator is obtained from mips fluxes using equation  4 in dale & helou ( 2002 ) . the solid and dotted lines in figure  [ fig : global_colors ]",
    "respectively indicate the flavors of sed models presented in dale & helou ( 2002 ) and dale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , derived from the average global trends for a sample of normal star - forming galaxies observed by  and .",
    "the solid curve incorporates an improved approach to modeling the far - infrared / submillimeter emission ( dale & helou 2002 ) .",
    "some of the low - metallicity objects lie dramatically below the canonical star - forming galaxy curves , consistent with the engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2005 ) empirical finding that low metallicity galaxies show relatively low 8.0  emission .",
    "these low - metallicity galaxies drive the scatter in the ratio between the inferred dust - only flux at 8  and the 8  flux as predicted from the dust model fitted to the mips fluxes .",
    "the dispersion in this ratio is 2.90 and 1.82  dex including and not including , respectively , the low - metallicity systems .",
    "a likely reason for the relatively low 8  flux for low - metallicity galaxies is a different balance between pah destruction and formation within these systems ( pahs dominate the emission at 8 ; see figures  8 and 12 in li & draine 2001 ) . for example , if pahs are formed by grain - surface chemistry in the interstellar medium ( so the grain formation rate would vary as the metallicity squared ) , and destroyed by gas - phase processes ( sputtering in shock waves , or photodestruction ) one might expect lower pah / dust ratios in low metallicity systems .",
    "finally , we note that the sings sample fills in more of the quiescent portion of the color - color space ( e.g. small values of ) , and in fact some of the points lie beyond the most quiescent values predicted by the previous generation of models .",
    "the sings sample spans a larger range of galaxy types , infrared / optical ratios , metallicities , and infrared colors than the sample from the  key project on the interstellar medium of normal galaxies , so it is unsurprising that some of the data points in figure  [ fig : global_colors ] do not exactly match the models predictions .      to properly execute a multi - wavelength investigation within galaxies , all the images were first convolved to match the point - spread function of the 160  beam which has fwhm of 38  ( see engelbracht et al .",
    "2004 ) . at the distances",
    "to ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331 , 38  corresponds to spatial scales of @xmath20.6 , 1.5 , and 2.8  kpc , respectively .",
    "after the data were all smoothed to the same resolution , sky - subtracted flux densities were extracted from the 170@xmath16 various regions within each galaxy ( figures  [ fig : apertures1 ] and [ fig : apertures2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : local_colors ] shows the mid - infrared color as a function of the far - infrared color for the various regions in these three galaxies . in general ,",
    "the observed seds are indicative of more intense radiation fields for regions closer to the nucleus and arms , with larger  ratios due to hotter large grains and smaller  ratios due to elevated small grain emission at 24 .",
    "the relatively low values for  near the nuclei and arm regions are unlikely explained by a diminution of the 8.0  flux as a result of the destruction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , since the radiation fields suggested by  within these galaxies are fairly mild .",
    "this issue is addressed in figure  [ fig : local_dust ] .",
    "the overall constancy of the 8.0-to - total infrared ratio in figure  [ fig : local_dust ] supports the conclusion that the relatively low values of  for high  are due to elevated 24  emission and not a reduction in the pah emission .",
    "another interesting facet of the data plotted in figure  [ fig : local_dust ] is the comparatively small variation in 8.0-to - total dust emission : the typical scatter within each galaxy is @xmath215% even as  varies by a factor of four .",
    "this result reinforces the notion that the observed variations in  do not arise from variations in 8.0-to - total dust emission , but rather from variations in 24-to - total dust emission .",
    "another obvious feature to figure  [ fig : local_colors ] is the substantial variations seen within a given galaxy s disk . the  and  colors vary by a factor of two or more within each disk , and the dispersion is larger the closer the galaxy .",
    "ngc  3031 shows the largest scatter because in this galaxy we are sampling the smallest spatial scales and thus the widest variety of environments .",
    "moreover , some of the local  values are smaller than that predicted from the globally - integrated properties of the most quiescent galaxies studied by _ iso _ and _ iras _",
    "( i.e. the leftmost values of the model curves displayed in figure  [ fig : local_colors ] ) .",
    "in other words , many of the local regions within these galaxies are more quiescent than what is seen for the global emission in normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is not unexpected , as globally - integrated emission will inevitably encompass some hot spots , raising the overall average  ratio above the typical cirrus value .",
    "as alluded to above , the star formation rate is conceptually linked to the shape of the far - infrared spectrum ",
    "regions near enhanced star formation should have more intense interstellar radiation fields , and thus the large grains in such regions should be hotter than their counterparts in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "however , before the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ and its superior angular resolving power , it was difficult to explore correlations between the far - infrared color and the local star formation rate in all but the closest of galaxies ( e.g. xu & helou 1994 ; xu & helou 1996 ) . figure  [ fig : sfr ] shows the far - infrared color as measured by  versus the local star formation rate for ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331 .",
    "star formation rates were computed using the relation presented in kennicutt ( 1998 ) : sfr ( @xmath17  year@xmath18 ( )  ( ergs  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the two quantities are clearly correlated ; a non - parametric ranking analysis indicates a correlation at the @xmath19 level .",
    "the ratio  is likewise correlated with the local star formation rate , and  much less so .",
    "these results suggest that both 24 and 70  trace warmer dust phases , consistent with morphological studies carried out by hinz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for m  33 , helou et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for ngc  300 , gordon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and rieke et al . for m  31",
    "( private communication ) .",
    "a large fraction of the 70  emission may come from the same grains that are thought to produce the 24  emission ( e.g. dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) , grains that are particularly sensitive to the effects of local star formation .",
    "one of the long - range goals of the sings project is to provide a reference set of empirical sed templates of nearby galaxies and regions within these galaxies that cover the full range of properties and interstellar environments found locally .",
    "these templates can then be applied in turn to model the observed redshifted seds of galaxies observed at cosmological distances .",
    "such templates are already available from  and  observations , such as the  key project sample ( e.g. dale & helou 2002 ) . the sings sample is more diverse than the key project sample ( metallicity , colors , morphology , etc . ) , and will eventually provide a definitive set of reference seds for such applications .",
    "the preliminary data presented here already provide some useful guidance ( and warnings ) for interpreting infrared observations of high - redshift galaxies from 24  or 8.0  data alone ( or together ) .",
    "as a guide for -based cosmological studies , we show in figure  [ fig : fir_z ] how the  and the ( dust - only ) bolometric - to-24  ratios would change as a function of redshift for a variety of sings - like objects .",
    "the tracks are pinned at redshift zero according to each source s observed infrared properties , and traced out to higher redshifts using the model of dale & helou ( 2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fir_z ] shows that sed variations remain a considerable source of systematic uncertainty even when the redshift is known .",
    "given the range of infrared spectral energy distributions observed for this portion of the sings galaxy sample , extrapolating the total infrared luminosity from the 24  emission alone would yield uncertainties at the factor - of - five level .",
    "this level of uncertainty can be reduced with some _ a priori _ constraints on the types and the redshifts of sources being studied ( e.g. papovich & bell 2002 ) , as well as information on the infrared colors ( e.g.  ratio or their redshifted equivalents ) .    however , for many current applications",
    "even the redshifted 24  emission is inaccessible , and one must rely on the _ observed _ 24  flux , which at @xmath0 corresponds to 8.0  in the rest frame .",
    "an in - depth analysis of the application of this index at high redshift will be presented in a separate paper ( smith et al . 2005 ) , but in the meantime we make some preliminary assessments based on the sed data shown in figures  [ fig : global_colors ] and [ fig : local_dust ] . within individual large , metal - rich galaxies such as ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331",
    "the ratio of 8.0-to - total infrared luminosity has a surprisingly low dispersion , less than a factor of two ( maximum to minimum ) within individual galaxies and hardly more among the three galaxies plotted in figure  [ fig : local_dust ] .",
    "however if one considers a much larger galaxy sample ( figure  [ fig : global_colors ] ) , the total range in 8.0-to - total infrared luminosity ratios swells to more than a factor of twenty .",
    "much of this large scatter can be attributed to a few metal - poor dwarf galaxies , in which the 8.0  pah emission is quenched . if one excludes the metal - poor dwarfs the total range of 8.0-to - total ratios shrinks to a factor of 10 , and this probably should be taken as a minimum systematic uncertainty in total infrared luminosities and star formation rates inferred from rest - frame 8.0  fluxes alone ( also see calzetti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "if the metal abundance of the population can not be inferred _ a priori _ then the uncertainties may be considerably higher .",
    "new  imaging data are coupled with data from mass , , , and  to investigate the properties of the 1 - 850  seds for _ mipsirac  nearby galaxies from the sings sample .",
    "the various shapes of the globally - integrated dust continuum generally follow the trends expected from the previous generation of infrared dust models that are based on  and  observations of normal star - forming galaxies from the  key project sample .",
    "however , the sings sample is more diverse than the key project sample ( metallicity , colors , morphology , etc ) , so it is perhaps not surprising that the sings sample shows larger variations in infrared colors .",
    "we also take advantage of s unprecedented angular resolving power to explore over 170 regions within ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331 .",
    "all three galaxies exhibit interesting trends in their infrared emission over the various environments sampled in this study . within each of these galaxies",
    "we find a wide variety of spectral shapes , especially for ngc  3031 , the closest of the three targets and thus the galaxy for which we are able to sample the smallest spatial scales .",
    "in particular we notice fairly constant ratios of dust - only 8.0  emission with respect to both bolometric dust emission , over large dynamic ranges of dust temperature as measured by .",
    "the relative contribution from pahs does not appear to significantly vary on kiloparsec scales , suggesting that the variations observed in  are largely driven by variations in the local 24  emission .",
    "the emission from galaxies at 24 , along with that at 70 , traces grains that are particularly sensitive to changes in the local interstellar radiation field and thus can be used as proxies for gauging the strength of the local star formation ( e.g. calzetti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this dataset on a wide - ranging sample of local galaxies is useful for estimating how accurately one can predict the total infrared luminosity ( and star formation rate ) from just the 8.0 or 24  data alone . though the 8.0-to - total infrared ratio varies by less than a factor of two within ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331 , the global ratio varies by more than a factor of 20 among our diverse sample of galaxies .",
    "the 24-to - total infrared ratio likewise spans a large range in the sings sample ( factor of 5 ) . in conjunction with models of infrared seds for normal star - forming galaxies",
    ", we predict that the _ observed _ 24-to - total infrared ratio ( e.g. rest - frame 8.0-to - total at @xmath20 ) maintains at least this dispersion at most epochs back to a redshift of four .",
    "as mentioned above , the characteristics of the infrared seds as seen by  are broadly consistent with normal galaxy models developed based on  and  data , but with perhaps more significant dispersion .",
    "once the complete sings dataset is in hand , the suite of empirical sed models referenced here will be updated according to the diversity of spectral shapes exhibited by the sings project .",
    "a more generally comprehensive and quantitative analysis will be pursued as well .",
    "for example , how much more dispersion in infrared colors is seen within galaxies versus between galaxies ?",
    "how do the global spectral shapes depend on metallicity in this sample ? are the infrared surface brightnesses correlated with the far - infrared color or galaxy type ?",
    "data from all 75 galaxies in the diverse sings sample will help to answer these questions .",

    "<S> the infrared colors derived from the globally - integrated  data are generally consistent with the previous generation of models that were developed based on global data for normal star - forming galaxies , though significant deviations are observed . </S>",
    "<S> s excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailed investigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for various locations within the three large , nearby galaxies ngc  3031 ( m  81 ) , ngc  5194 ( m  51 ) , and ngc  7331 . </S>",
    "<S> a wide variety of spectral shapes is found within each galaxy , especially for ngc  3031 , the closest of the three targets and thus the galaxy for which the smallest spatial scales can be explored . </S>",
    "<S> strong correlations exist between the local star formation rate and the infrared colors  and , suggesting that the 24 and 70  emission are useful tracers of the local star formation activity level . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the 24  emission , and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8 , drive the variations in the  colors within ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331 . </S>",
    "<S> if the galaxy - to - galaxy variations in spectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of the range present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infrared luminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24  flux will be uncertain at the factor - of - five level ( total range ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding uncertainties using the redshifted 8.0  flux ( e.g. observed 24  flux for a @xmath0 source ) are factors of 1020 . </S>",
    "<S> considerable caution should be used when interpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities . </S>"
