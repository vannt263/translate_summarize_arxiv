    "in solving many mathematical and physical problems by means of numerical methods one is often challenged to seek derivatives of various functions given in discrete points . in such cases , when it is difficult or impossible to take derivative of a function analytically one resorts to numerical differentiation .",
    "it should be noted that there exists a great deal of formulae and techniques of numerical differentiation ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a rule",
    ", the function in question @xmath0 is replaced with the easy - to - calculate function @xmath1 and then it is approximately supposed that @xmath2 .",
    "the derivatives of higher orders are computed similarly .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain numerical value of the derivative of the considered function it is necessary to indicate correctly the interpolating function @xmath3 .",
    "if the values of the function @xmath0 are known in @xmath4 discrete points , the function @xmath3 is usually taken as the polynomial of @xmath5th power .    to find the derivative of functions having the intervals both quick and slow variation quasi - uniform nets are used ( see ref .",
    "this method has an advantage since constant small mesh width is unfavorable in this case , because it leads to the strong enhancement of the function values table .",
    "the problem of the numerical differentiation accuracy is also of interest .",
    "the numerical differentiations formulae , taking into account the values of the considered function both at @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is a point where the derivative is computed ) , are called central differentiation formulae . for instance , the formulae based on stirling interpolating polynomial can be included in this class .",
    "such formulae are known to have higher accuracy compared to the formulae , using unilateral values of a function , i.e. , for instance , at @xmath6 .",
    "the range of numerical differentiation formulae based on different interpolating polynomials is limited , as a rule , to finite points of interpolation .",
    "all available formulae known at the present moment are obtained for a certain concrete limited number of interpolation points ( see refs .",
    "it can be explained by the fact that the procedure of the finding of the interpolating polynomial coefficients in the case of the arbitrary number of interpolation points is quite awkward and requires formidable calculations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the procedure of the numerical differentiation is incorrect .",
    "indeed , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that it is possible to select such decreasing error of the function in question which results in the unlimited growth of the error in its first derivative .",
    "some recent publications devoted to the numerical differentiation problem should be mentioned ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work",
    "the finite difference formulae for real functions on one dimensional grids with arbitrary spacing were considered .",
    "the formulae of central differentiation for the finding of the first and the second derivatives of the functions given in @xmath9 discrete points are derived in this paper .",
    "the number of interpolation points is taken to be arbitrary .",
    "the obtained formulae for the derivatives calculation do not require direct construction of the interpolating polynomial . as an example of the use of the developed method we calculate the first derivative of the function @xmath10 .",
    "the obtained result is studied in the limiting case @xmath11 .",
    "we examine the spectral characteristics of the weight coefficients sequence of the numerical differentiation formulae for the different number of the interpolation points .",
    "the performed analysis can be applied to the studying of the accuracy of the numerical differentiation technique developed in this work .",
    "it is found that the derived formulae of numerical differentiation have a high accuracy in a very wide range of spatial frequencies .",
    "without the restriction of generality we suppose that the derivative is taken in the zero point , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath0 given in equidistant points @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the constant value .",
    "we can pass the interpolating polynomial of the @xmath16th power through these points @xmath17 the values of the function in points of interpolation @xmath18 coinciding with the values of the interpolating polynomial in these points : @xmath19 .",
    "let us define as @xmath20 the differences of the values of the function @xmath0 in diametrically opposite points @xmath21 and @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "we can present @xmath20 in the form @xmath24 to find the coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 , we have gotten the system of inhomogeneous linear equations with the given free terms @xmath20 .",

    "] in the following way @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the undetermined coefficients satisfying the condition @xmath29 thus , the system of equations [ eq .  ]",
    "is reduced to the equivalent , but more simple system [ eq .  ] , in which for each fixed number @xmath30 it is necessary to find the coefficients @xmath31 .",

    "it follows that the determinant of the system of equations [ eq .  ]",
    "is not equal to zero , i.e. the system of equations [ eq .",
    "] has the single solution .",
    "the most simple expression for @xmath35 is obtained in the case of @xmath36 that corresponds to a calculation of the first - order derivative @xmath37 from eq .   as well as taking into account eqs .",
    "and we get the expression for the coefficients @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 it should be noted that one can similarly get the expression for the coefficients @xmath41 which is presented in the following way @xmath42 taking into account eqs .  - we finally get the formula for the first derivative of the function @xmath0 @xmath43 the algorithm for the computation of the coefficients @xmath38 is presented in the appendix  [ append ] and the results for the certain concrete number of the interpolation points @xmath9 are given in tab .",

    "however , technique developed in this article allows one to calculate the coefficients @xmath38 , and hence the first derivative , for any value of @xmath45 .",
    "similar formula can be obtained for the calculation of the second derivative .",
    "we give without proof corresponding expression @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the product @xmath48 is introduced in eq .  .",
    "as an example of the use of the obtained central differentiation formulae we will compute the first derivative of the function @xmath10 at @xmath49 .",
    "let us set the value of the mesh width @xmath15 equal to @xmath50 .",
    "notice that , as a rule , the less the mesh width @xmath15 the more exact result numerical differentiation gives .",
    "we have chosen rather big value of @xmath15 .",
    "the eq .   for this case takes the form @xmath51 in eq .",
    "we take that @xmath52 if @xmath53 is an even number , and @xmath54 if @xmath53 is an odd number .",
    "let us study the obtained result in the limiting case @xmath11 .",
    "first , it is necessary to calculate the value of the product @xmath48 within the limit @xmath11 @xmath55 here we used the known value of infinite product @xmath56 using eqs .   and , we find that the expression for the coefficients @xmath38 within the limit @xmath11 is represented in the following way @xmath57 now it is easy to complete the studying of eq .  . substituting the result from eq .   to eq .",
    "and using the known value of infinite series we get that @xmath58 thus , it is shown that the method of the derivatives finding , developed in this paper , gives for the function @xmath10 the value of the first derivative which coincides with the exact analytical one even at rather crude mesh width .",
    "in the section  [ ffderiv ] of the present work we derived the formula for the finding of the first derivative of the function @xmath0 at @xmath49 . this result can be easily generalized for the case of the arbitrary point @xmath59 . if we set that @xmath60 , and moreover supposing that @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see tab .",
    "[ alphatab ] ) , then in the considered case eq .   reads as follows @xmath64 here the summing is taken over all range of the function involved : @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , if the values of the function are set on the limited equidistant collection of elements @xmath66 , then eq .   can be rewritten in the form @xmath67 it is worth noticing that in eq .",
    "we used the periodicity condition of the weight coefficients @xmath68 fig .",
    "[ alphan1 ] presents the example of the weight coefficients of the differentiating sequence @xmath69 .    .",
    "]    thus the first derivative computation of the function @xmath0 at the points @xmath59 , @xmath70 , is reduced to the procedure of the calculation of the mutual correlation function between the finite sequences @xmath38 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that if a function satisfies the dirichlet conditions in the interval @xmath72 , then it can be expanded into the fourier series @xmath73 where the expansion coefficients are presented in the way @xmath74 if the first derivative @xmath75 satisfies the analogous conditions as the function @xmath0 , then the following expression will be valid @xmath76 therefore , form eqs .   and",
    "it follows that the differentiation procedure is the linear filter with the frequency characteristic : @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "similarly we receive for the second derivative @xmath78 in this case the the frequency characteristic of the corresponding filter has the form : @xmath79 .    according to wiener - khinchin theorem ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the mutual correlation function between the two finite sequences can be calculated with the help of the inverse fourier transform of the mutual spectrum of the considered sequences .",
    "thus , if we define that @xmath80 is the complex spectrum of the differentiating sequence @xmath38 , and @xmath81 is the spectrum of the function @xmath0 , then it follows from eq .",
    "that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the complex conjugated quantity with respect to @xmath84 .    comparing eqs .",
    "and we obtain that the accuracy of the numerical differentiation performed with the use of the various types of the sequences @xmath38 is characterized by the closeness of imaginary parts of their spectra to the linearly growing sequence @xmath85 .",

    "[ alphan1 ] , the imaginary part of the spectrum is the branch of the function @xmath88 .",

    "the presented results demonstrate the high accuracy of the numerical differentiation carried out with the help of the sequences @xmath38 in the wide range of the spatial frequencies .",
    "now let us briefly consider the sequences for the calculation of the second derivative @xmath98 , which are given in eq .  .",
