    "<S> we show that the annual modulation signal observed by dama can be reconciled with all other negative results from dark matter searches with a conventional halo model for particle masses around 5 to 9 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also show which particular dark matter stream could produce the dama signal .    </S>",
    "<S> ucla/05/tep/33 + december 2005    given the country which hosts this conference , taup2005 , i was tempted to change the title into a well known spanish aphorism  </S>",
    "<S> los muertos que vos matais gozan the buena salud \" . </S>",
    "<S> although the dama signal may not be entirely ingood health \" , the point of this talk , based on ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is to show that , even with the usual assumptions on the dark halo of our galaxy , the dama claim has not yet been rejected by other experimental results .    </S>",
    "<S> the dama collaboration @xcite , has found an annual modulation in its data compatible with the signal expected from dark matter ( dm ) particles bound to our galactic halo . other such experiments , </S>",
    "<S> cdms @xcite , edelweiss @xcite , and cresst @xcite , have not found any signal from weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been difficult to reconcile a wimp signal in dama with the other negative results  @xcite .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we showed that it is possible to have a dark matter signal above the wimp speed threshold for dama and below the wimp speed threshold for cdms and edelweiss , so that the positive and negative detection results can be compatible . </S>",
    "<S> our idea is based on attributing the dama signal to scattering off na , instead of i , and can be tested in the immediate future by detectors using light nuclei , such as cdms - ii ( using si ) and cresst - ii ( using o ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found : ( 1 ) that with the standard dark halo model there is a solution for wimp masses about 5 - 9 gev and wimp - proton scattering cross section of about 1 femtobarn ( @xmath0  @xmath1 ) , and ( 2 ) that this region of solutions can be enlarged if a dark matter stream is suitably added to the standard dark halo . </S>",
    "<S> dm streams have been considered before  @xcite , but we looked for a stream with speed above threshold for na in dama and below threshold for ge in cdms and with the right arrival direction to produce the annual modulation seen by dama . </S>",
    "<S> the stream should come from the general direction of the galactic rotation ( it can not be the sagittarius stream ) . </S>",
    "<S> see figs . 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the region in point ( 1 ) could certainly also be enlarged by considering more general halo models , even in the absence of dark matter streams ( see e.g.  the models in  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> light neutralinos as wimps with masses as low as 2  gev @xcite or , with updated bounds , 6  gev @xcite have been considered , but their cross sections are about one order of magnitude smaller than those needed here . </S>",
    "<S> in ref  @xcite we proceeded in a purely phenomenological way in choosing the wimp mass and cross section . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we concentrated on spin - independent cross sections only .    </S>",
    "<S> our basic idea is very simple . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum wimp speed required to produce a nuclear recoil energy @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reduced mass , @xmath5 the wimp mass and @xmath6 the nucleus mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus the experimental energy threshold @xmath7 corresponds to a minimum observable speed @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> let us simplify our argument by considering @xmath9 , then @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily compare the square - roots for ge in cdms - suf ( @xmath12 ) and for na in dama ( @xmath13 ) , and find that @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 are even larger for cdms - soudan , edelweiss and experiments with heavier nuclei . without using @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily see that @xmath15 for @xmath16 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is possible to have halo dm wimps with speeds above threshold for na in dama and below threshold for ge in cdms and edelweiss .    , and heliocentric speed of 900  km / s . in the hatched region , </S>",
