    "@xcite that for gapped systems at small temperature , thermal corrections to the entanglement entropy are boltzmann suppressed .",

    "( in order for these formulae to hold , the conformal field theory on the circle has to have a unique ground state and a mass gap . )    for higher dimensional conformal field theories on @xmath16 , an analogous thermal correction to entanglement entropy is also known @xcite .",
    "the result for the entanglement entropy for a cap on a sphere with polar angle @xmath17 and radius @xmath18 is given in general by the following integral : @xmath19 the derivation of this result relies on a conformal transformation from the sphere to hyperbolic space . unfortunately , there can be subtleties associated with boundary terms when this transformation is invoked . in the case of conformally coupled scalars @xcite , these boundary terms replace @xmath20 in the result above with @xmath21 .",
    "the issue is that the conformal coupling requires a gibbons - hawking like term on the boundary .",
    "the natural constant @xmath17 boundary is different from the boundary of hyperbolic space , and this difference contaminates the entanglement entropy . in this paper",
    "we study free fermions which have no such gibbons - hawking like term and consequently no subtleties associated with the boundary .",
    "thus we expect and indeed find that the result ( [ delta ] ) holds for massless free fermions .",
    "as an added benefit , we also compute thermal corrections to rnyi entropies for fermions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly review the mapping used in ref .",
    "@xcite that maps from the multi - sheeted cover of the sphere to a wedge in flat space .",
    "we then calculate the two point function using the method of images , from which we can read off the thermal corrections to rnyi entropies .",
    "finally , we compare these calculations of entanglement and rnyi entropies with numerical results for fermions in @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a main result from ref .",
    "@xcite was a general equation for the thermal correction to the rnyi entropy for a conformal field theory .",
    "we assume that when the conformal field theory is placed on a @xmath24 , there is a unique ground state @xmath25 and a set of degenerate first excited states @xmath26 with energy @xmath27 .",
    "we divide the @xmath28 into a spatial region @xmath3 and complement @xmath4 and consider instead of @xmath24 , an @xmath2-sheeted branched cover of this spacetime where the branching is over the region @xmath3 . the result from ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an operator that creates one of the first excited states .",
    "the point @xmath31 is in the far euclidean future and the point @xmath32 in the far euclidean past .",
    "the subscript @xmath2 indicates the two - point function is to be evaluated on this @xmath2-sheeted branched cover .",
    "( note that the result ( [ generalrenyi ] ) could have been anticipated from a very similar result in 1 + 1 dimensional conformal field theories @xcite . )    in general , it is not clear how to evaluate @xmath33 .",
    "however , if we restrict to the case where @xmath3 is a cap on a sphere of opening angle @xmath34 , then we can take advantage of a conformal transformation that maps the @xmath2-sheeted branched cover of @xmath24 to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an @xmath2-sheeted cover of the complex plane , branched over the negative real axis .",
    "it is convenient to make the transformation in a couple of steps , as was outlined in ref .",
    "the first step takes the cap on @xmath28 to a ball in @xmath37 ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the line element on @xmath41 if the cap has opening angle @xmath42 , then the ball has radius @xmath43 .",
    "a further special conformal transformation maps the ball to a half space : @xmath44 we let @xmath45 and @xmath46 correspond to euclidean times , and take @xmath47 to be the only non - vanishing value of the vector @xmath48 .",
    "after further rescaling and rotations , the inserted operators can be placed at @xmath49 ( 1,2@xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( 1,0,@xmath52 ) , where we are using polar coordinates @xmath53 on the @xmath36 .",
    "( for further details , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "we will employ a method of images strategy for computing @xmath54 on @xmath35 .",
    "this strategy was already used successfully for the scalar in refs .",
    "the idea is to compute the two - point function using the method of images on the orbifold @xmath55 for general @xmath56 and then to obtain @xmath54 by analytic continuation , setting @xmath57 . as the method of images relies on the fact that the underlying equations of motion are linear",
    ", we do not expect this method will be useful for interacting field theories .",
    "in the fermionic case , there are issues associated with nontrivial phases , signs and a choice of spin structure which we must address .",
    "one issue , which we now review , is that rotations act nontrivially on spinor wave functions .      for a dirac fermion",
    "we know the effect of a rotation on the components of the spinor @xcite .",
    "a general lorentz transformation in euclidean signature , @xmath58 , is given by @xmath59\\right ) , \\\\",
    "& \\{\\gamma^\\mu , \\gamma^\\nu\\ } = 2\\delta^{\\mu\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 parameterizes the rotations and lorentz boosts .",
    "for the case of interest we are only interested in rotations in ( 0,1 ) plane , for which the only non - vanishing components are @xmath61 .",
    "the matrix exponential can be done simply and is given by @xmath62 if we then define @xmath63 then equation ( @xmath64 ) simplifies to @xmath65    a fact that we will rely on heavily moving forward is that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are projectors : @xmath68",
    "in flat space the fermion 2-point function is , up to normalization , @xmath69    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the green s function on a wedge @xmath70 can be calculated via the method of images .",
    "the green s function via the method of images is given by rotating one of the fermions by @xmath71 where @xmath72 indexes the wedges and @xmath56 is the number of wedges . in going between adjacent",
    "wedges an extra factor of ( -1 ) is added due to the spin structure ( for example see ref .",
    "the result is then @xmath73^{(d-2)/2 } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( curiously , this expression only makes sense for @xmath56 an odd integer .",
    "nevertheless , we find that knowing the two - point function for odd integers is in general sufficient to make the analytic continuation to @xmath57 . ) in the case of interest @xmath74 , @xmath32 = @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the two - point function can be rewritten @xmath77 \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression , we can deduce the following recursion relation for the two - point function : @xmath78    to obtain the rnyi entropy we make the replacement @xmath79 in the two point function and we use that @xmath80 for free fermions on a sphere of radius @xmath18 : @xmath81      in @xmath9 we can choose gamma matrices ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) such that @xmath84 it is worth noting that it is convenient to have @xmath85 diagonal , but is not necessary .",
    "then the 2-point function is given by @xmath86    we can then calculate the rnyi entropies ( and entanglement ) .",
    "@xmath87 these agree with the known results for 2d cfts @xcite in general and for 2d fermions @xcite in particular .",
    "in @xmath23 we choose gamma matrices @xmath88 in this case the 2-point function is given by @xmath89    repeating the calculation in @xmath90 we get @xmath91 the second result correctly reproduces the entanglement entropy correction found for general conformal field theories on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath92 is new .",
    "in odd dimensions we can choose the same @xmath93 as we would use in one smaller dimension .",
    "namely , @xmath84 following previous work @xcite , we may try to convert the denominator of the green s function ( [ gf ] ) to an integral in order to perform the sum over @xmath72 . in the case of the scalar",
    ", the resulting expression can be analytically continued to all @xmath56 and thus in particular to @xmath57 .",
    "however , in the case of the fermion , some extra phases appear to spoil the analytic continuation .",
    "we are able to extract thermal corrections to entanglement entropy from an @xmath7 limit of the integral successfully .",
    "thermal corrections to rnyi entropies remain out of reach however .",
    "the first step in converting the sum to an integral is an integral representation of the cosecant used successfully in the analogous calculation for the scalars @xcite : @xmath94 from this integral representation , it directly follows that @xmath95 using the representation ( @xmath96 ) in the green s function ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99    to get the entanglement entropy , we expand around @xmath100 : @xmath101 the entanglement entropy correction is then constructed from a ratio of green s functions @xmath102 this result matches the general case derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while this integral representation gives the correct thermal corrections to the entanglement entropy , it appears to fail for the rnyi entropies .",
    "we suspect a reason is that the integral representation grows too quickly as a function of complex @xmath56 to satisfy the assumptions of carlson s theorem .",
    "in other words , there will not be a unique analytic continuation .",
    "we can break the integral up into two pieces , one from @xmath103 and a second from @xmath104 , and then replace the two integrals with double sums : @xmath105 in the case of the scalar , the phases in the numerator of this expression vanish , and the sum has better convergence properties . here instead , for @xmath106 pure imaginary , the sum has the same kind of growth as @xmath107 , which vanishes for all integer @xmath56 .",
    "we would also like to show that our recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) is compatible with the recursion relation for the entanglement entropy found in ref .",
    "we start by taylor expanding the two - point function and relating it to the entanglement entropy is diagonal so that the inverse is particularly simple . ]",
    "@xmath108    we will proceed by induction and assume equation ( [ delta ] ) in @xmath109 dimensions .",
    "equation ( [ i d ] ) has the following recursion relation @xmath110 then using equation ( [ delta ] ) and recalling that @xmath111 , @xmath112 acting on both sides with the operator in equation ( [ recursion ] ) and simplifying yields @xmath113 we checked the entanglement entropy for both @xmath9 and @xmath22 . thus by induction the two recursion relations are in agreement for both even and odd dimensions .",
    "we are interested in numerically checking our results .",
    "as mentioned earlier a free fermion on a sphere does not suffer from the same boundary term ambiguities as the conformally coupled scalar @xcite .",
    "the numerics for a free fermion should then directly give the general conformal field theory results .",
    "using the convention @xmath114 the hamiltonian and lagrangian densities for a fermion in curved space are given by @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the covariant derivative on the manifold .",
    "this can be written explicitly in terms of the vierbein ( @xmath118 ) and spin connection ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "for flat space - time indices , lower case greek @xmath120 for curved space - time indices , lower case greek @xmath121 for spinor indices , and lower case roman @xmath122 for curved spatial indices .",

    ", we can extract the spin connection , the nonvanishing elements of which are @xmath126 the general hamiltonian in @xmath127 dimensions is then @xmath128 where @xmath15 is a flat spatial index .",
    "we can remove the cotangents and the volume factor in the commutation relation with the following definition @xmath129 : @xmath130 to obtain a numerical result efficiently , we turn this hamiltonian density into a @xmath9 hamiltonian . to this end , we integrate over @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "we then calculate the spectrum of @xmath133 where the lowest energy , smallest eigenvalue , gives the lowest order thermal correction to the rnyi entropies . for general @xmath109",
    "the result is @xmath134 as can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we discretize these hamiltonians , turning the integral into a sum and the derivative into a finite difference .",
    "we then numerically calculate the entanglement and rnyi entropies in the same way as previous papers @xcite .",
