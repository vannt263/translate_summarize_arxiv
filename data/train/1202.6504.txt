    "discriminative learning algorithms are typically trained from large collections of vectorial training examples . in many classical learning problems , however , it is arguably more appropriate to represent training data not as individual data points , but as probability distributions .",
    "there are , in fact , multiple reasons why probability distributions may be preferable .",
    "firstly , uncertain or missing data naturally arises in many applications .",
    "for example , gene expression data obtained from the microarray experiments are known to be very noisy due to various sources of variabilities @xcite . in order to reduce uncertainty , and to allow for estimates of confidence levels ,",
    "experiments are often replicated .",
    "unfortunately , the feasibility of replicating the microarray experiments is often inhibited by cost constraints , as well as the amount of available mrna . to cope with experimental uncertainty given a limited amount of data , it is natural to represent each array as a probability distribution that has been designed to approximate the variability of gene expressions across slides .",
    "probability distributions may be equally appropriate given an abundance of training data . in data - rich disciplines such as neuroinformatics , climate informatics , and astronomy",
    ", a high throughput experiment can easily generate a huge amount of data , leading to significant computational challenges in both time and space . instead of scaling up one s learning algorithms , one can scale down one s dataset by constructing a smaller collection of distributions which represents groups of similar samples .",
    "besides computational efficiency , aggregate statistics can potentially incorporate higher - level information that represents the collective behavior of multiple data points .",
    "previous attempts have been made to learn from distributions by creating positive definite ( p.d . )",
    "kernels on probability measures . in @xcite , the probability product kernel ( ppk ) was proposed as a generalized inner product between two input objects , which is in fact closely related to well - known kernels such as the bhattacharyya kernel @xcite and the exponential symmetrized kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence @xcite . in @xcite , an extension of a two - parameter family of hilbertian metrics of topse",
    "was used to define hilbertian kernels on probability measures . in @xcite",
    ", the semi - group kernels were designed for objects with additive semi - group structure such as positive measures .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures based on new jensen - shannon - type divergences .",
    "although these kernels have proven successful in many applications , they are designed specifically for certain properties of distributions and application domains .",
    "moreover , there has been no attempt in making a connection to the kernels on corresponding input spaces .",
    "the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we prove the representer theorem for a regularization framework over the space of probability distributions , which is a generalization of regularization over the input space on which the distributions are defined ( section [ sec : regularization ] ) .",
    "second , a family of positive definite kernels on distributions is introduced ( section [ sec : distkernel ] ) .",
    "based on such kernels , a learning algorithm on probability measures called _ support measure machine _ ( smm ) is proposed .",
    "an svm on the input space is provably a special case of the smm .",
    "third , the paper presents the relations between sample - based and distribution - based methods ( section [ sec : relation ] ) .",
    "if the distributions depend only on the locations in the input space , the smm particularly reduces to a more flexible svm that places different kernels on each data point .",
    "given a non - empty set @xmath0 , let @xmath1 denote the set of all probability measures @xmath2 on a measurable space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a @xmath5-algebra of subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "the goal of this work is to learn a function @xmath6 given a set of example pairs @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in other words ,",
    "we consider a supervised setting in which input training examples are probability distributions . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the binary classification problem , i.e. , @xmath10 .    in order to learn from distributions ,",
    "we employ a compact representation that not only preserves necessary information of individual distributions , but also permits efficient computations .",
    "that is , we adopt a hilbert space embedding to represent the distribution as a mean function in an rkhs @xcite .",

    "therefore , the standard representer theorem is recovered as a particular case ( see also @xcite for more general results on representer theorem ) .",
    "note that , on the one hand , the minimization problem is different from minimizing the functional @xmath38 for the special case of the additive loss @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the solution of our regularization problem is different from what one would get in the limit by training on an infinitely many points sampled from @xmath40 . on the other hand , it is also different from minimizing the functional @xmath41 where @xmath42 $ ] . in a sense ,",
    "our framework is something in between .",

    "although requiring more computational effort , their practical use is simple and flexible .",

    "kernels on distributions proposed in this work is so generic that standard kernel functions can be reused to derive kernels on distributions that are different from many other kernel functions proposed specifically for certain distributions .",

    "it is therefore of theoretical interest to consider more general classes of universal kernels on probability distributions .",

    "a binary classification problem of 7 gaussian distributions with different means and covariances was considered .",

    "figure [ fig : asvm - smm - compare ] shows the resulting decision boundaries .",
    "having been trained only on means of the distributions , the svm classifier tends to overemphasize the regions with high densities and underrepresent the lower density regions .",
    "in contrast , the asvm is more expensive and sensitive to outliers , especially when learning on heavy - tailed distributions .",
    "the smm treats each distribution as a training example and implicitly incorporates properties of the distributions , i.e. , means and covariances , into the classifier .",
    "note that the svm can be trained to achieve a similar result to the smm by choosing an appropriate value for @xmath138 ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : smm - svm ] ) . nevertheless , this becomes more difficult if the training distributions are , for example , nonisotropic and have different covariance matrices .",
