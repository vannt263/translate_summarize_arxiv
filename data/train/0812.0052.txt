    "let @xmath0 be a random sample from an unknown density @xmath1 .",
    "a kernel density estimator of @xmath1 at the point @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the bandwidth , and @xmath5 is the kernel , which is generally chosen to be a unimodal probability density function that is symmetric about zero and has finite variance .",
    "a popular choice for @xmath5 is the gaussian kernel : @xmath6 . to distinguish between estimators with different kernels",
    ", we shall refer to estimator with given kernel @xmath5 as a _",
    "@xmath5-kernel estimator_.    practical implementation of the estimator   requires specification of the smoothing parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the two most widely used bandwidth selection methods are least squares cross - validation , proposed independently by   and  , and the   plug - in method .",
    "plug - in is often preferred since it produces more stable bandwidths than does lscv . nevertheless , the lscv method is still popular since it requires fewer assumptions than the plug - in method and works well when the density is difficult to estimate ; see  ,  , and  .",
    "the main flaw of lscv is high variability of the selected bandwidths .",
    "other drawbacks include the tendency of cross - validation curves to exhibit multiple local minima with the first local minimum being too small ( see  ) , and the tendency of lscv to select bandwidths that are much too small when the data exhibit a small amount of autocorrelation ( see   and   for results of a numerical study ) .",
    "many modifications of lscv have been proposed in an attempt to improve its performance . these include biased cross - validation of  , a method of  , the trimmed cross - validation of  , the modified cross - validation of  , and the method of   based on kernel contrasts .",
    "this paper is concerned with a new modification of the lscv method , called _ indirect cross - validation _ ( icv ) , recently proposed by the authors  .",
    "the icv method depends on two parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a main theoretical result is that at asymptotically optimal choices of @xmath8 and @xmath9 the icv bandwidth can converge to zero at a rate @xmath10 , which is substantially better than the @xmath11 rate of lscv .",
    "the present paper contains the results of an empirical study of icv . in section  [ sec : description ] we provide a description of the method .",
    "section  [ sec : practical ] contains the details underlying the development of a practical purpose model for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "section  [ sec : sims ] outlines the results of a numerical study which , in particular , show that icv has greater stability in finite samples than does lscv .",
    "in section  [ sec : data ] we apply icv and a local version of icv to real data sets .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] provides a summary of our results .",
    "we begin with some notation and definitions that will be used subsequently . for an arbitrary function @xmath12 , define @xmath13 where here and subsequently integrals are assumed to be over the whole real line .",
    "the popular measures of performance of the kernel estimators   are integrated squared error ( ise ) and mean integrated squared error ( mise ) .",
    "the ise is defined as @xmath14 and mise is defined as the expectation of ise .",
    "assuming that the underlying density @xmath1 has second derivative which is continuous and square integrable and that @xmath15 , the bandwidth which asymptotically minimizes the mise of the @xmath16kernel estimator   has the following form : @xmath17    the lscv criterion is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the kernel estimator ( [ eq : kde ] ) constructed from the data without the observation @xmath20 .",
    "a well known fact is that @xmath21 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath22 .",
    "for this reason the lscv method is often called _ unbiased cross - validation_. let @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the bandwidths which minimize the lscv function   and the mise of the @xmath25-kernel estimator .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] defines the icv bandwidth , denoted as @xmath26 .",
    "the essence of the icv method is to use different kernels at the cross - validation and density estimation stages .",
    "the same idea is exploited by the one - sided cross - validation method of   in the regression context .",
    "icv first selects the bandwidth of an @xmath27kernel estimator using least squares cross - validation .",
    "selection kernels @xmath28 used for this purpose are described in section  [ sec : kernels ] .",
    "the bandwidth so obtained is rescaled so that it can be used with the @xmath25-kernel estimator .",
    "the multiplicative constant @xmath29 has the following form : @xmath30 which is motivated by the asymptotically optimal mise bandwidth  .",
    "we consider the family of kernels @xmath31 , where , for all @xmath32 , @xmath33 note that the gaussian kernel is a special case of   when @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "each member of @xmath36 is symmetric about 0 and has the second moment @xmath37 .",
    "it follows that kernels in @xmath36 are second order , with the exception of those for which @xmath38 .",
    "the family @xmath36 can be partitioned into three families : @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the first of these is @xmath42 .",
    "each kernel in @xmath43 has a negative dip centered at @xmath44 .",
    "the kernels in @xmath45 are ones that `` cut - out - the - middle , '' some examples of which are shown in figure  [ fig : lplot]*(a)*.    the second family is @xmath46 .",
    "kernels in @xmath47 are densities which can be unimodal or bimodal .",
    "note that the gaussian kernel is a member of this family .",
    "the third family is @xmath48 , each member of which has negative tails .",
    "examples are shown in figure  [ fig : lplot]*(b)*.    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     local icv and lscv have been applied to the dc data .",
    "we used @xmath49 for both methods and the selection kernel with @xmath50 and @xmath51 for local icv .",
    "this @xmath52 choice performed quite well for unimodal densities in our simulation studies on global icv , and hence seems to be reasonable for local bandwidth selection since locally the density should have relatively few features .",
    "let @xmath53 , @xmath54 , denote the @xmath55th member of the ordered sequence of observations .",
    "the local icv and lscv bandwidth were found for 50 evenly spaced points in the interval @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out that in 45 out of 50 cases the local lscv curve tends to @xmath57 as @xmath58 , which implies that the local lscv estimate can not be computed .",
    "all 50 local icv bandwidths were positive .",
    "we found a smooth function @xmath59 by interpolating at other values of @xmath2 via a spline .",
    "the corresponding local icv estimate , given in figure  [ fig : dc]*(b ) * , shows a smoother density estimate .",
    "indirect cross - validation is a method of bandwidth selection in the univariate kernel density estimation context .",
    "the method first selects the bandwidth of an @xmath27kernel estimator by least squares cross - validation , and then rescales this bandwidth so that it is appropriate for use in a gaussian kernel density estimator .",
    "selection kernels @xmath28 have the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath25 is the gaussian kernel .",
    "optimal kernels from this class yield bandwidths with relative error that converges to 0 at a rate of @xmath10 , which is a substantial improvement over the @xmath11 rate of lscv .    a practical purpose model for the selection kernel parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , has been developed .",
    "the model was built by performing polynomial regression on the mse - optimal values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 at different sample sizes for five target densities .",
    "use of this model makes the icv method completely automatic .",
    "an extensive simulation study showed that in finite samples icv is more stable than lscv .",
    "although both icv and lscv bandwidths are asymptotically normal , the distribution of the icv bandwidth for finite @xmath65 is usually more symmetric and better concentrated in the middle of the density for ise - optimal bandwidths .",
    "using an oversmoothed bandwidth as an upper bound for the bandwidth search interval reduces the bias of the method and prevents selecting an impractically large value of @xmath7 when the criterion curves exhibit multiple local minima .",
    "the icv method performs well in real data examples .",
    "icv applied locally yields density estimates which are more smooth than estimates based on a single bandwidth .",
    "often , local icv estimates may be found when the local lscv estimates do not exist ."
