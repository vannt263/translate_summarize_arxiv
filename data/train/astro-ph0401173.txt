    "study of relativistic emission lines in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies has the potential to elucidate the nature of the accretion disk and spacetime geometry near supermassive black holes .",
    "a very broad feature was observed by _",
    "asca _ near the energy of the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath1 line in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite and other seyfert galaxies @xcite . convincing examples measured by _ xmm - newton _ include mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite and mrk 766 @xcite .",
    "the current best explanation for this feature is doppler and gravitationally broadened fe k - shell emission from an accretion disk which extends close to the innermost circular orbit of a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of relativistic emission lines in the _ soft _ x - ray spectra of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 @xcite may help to reveal the ionization structure and elemental abundances in the accretion disk .",
    "the o viii , n vii , and c vi ly@xmath1 emission lines probe high ionization states which may arise in the photoionized surface of the disk .",
    "this is complementary to studies which have indicated emission from highly ionized fe in these same galaxies @xcite .",
    "ionized accretion disk models have been compared to the observations , but have yet to be explicitly fit to grating spectra .",
    "the predicted emission line equivalent widths depend primarily on the vertical ionization structure and abundances in the top layer of the accretion disk .",
    "both constant density @xcite and hydrostatic balance @xcite have been used to set the density profile of the disk .",
    "together with the disk illumination law , this determines the ionization structure .",
    "constant density slab models predict o viii ly@xmath1 equivalent widths of 30 - 70 ev for a disk with solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the observed o viii equivalent widths in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 are 2 - 5 times these predicted values .",
    "however , the optical depth of the photoionized skin can be increased by raising the ratio of disk flux to x - ray flux , explaining the observed o viii ly@xmath1 equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "more problematic are the very strong n vii ly@xmath1 emission lines and lack of fe l - shell lines observed in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 .",
    "the observed equivalent widths require n / o abundance ratios which are several times solar .",
    "radiative transfer effects may be important for explaining the anomalous emission line ratios .",
    "it is possible to pump the n vii ly@xmath1 emission line with o viii ly@xmath1 photons via bowen resonance fluorescence @xcite .",
    "the lack of relativistic fe l - shell lines may be explained by a large o viii edge opacity , while the o viii ly@xmath2 line could be suppressed by resonance scattering @xcite .",
    "it is also essential to model the effects of an overlying ionized absorber component @xcite .",
    "an alternative model has been proposed to explain the soft x - ray spectral features in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 by absorption edges from neutral fe in dust instead of relativistic emission lines @xcite .",
    "the apparently reddened optical - uv continuum , strong x - ray absorption , and weak uv / x - ray flux ratio in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite supports the notion of a dusty ionized absorber . in this model , the dust",
    "must be embedded in a highly ionized medium in order to avoid strong edges from neutral he , c , and n which would obliterate the x - ray spectrum at the column densities inferred from the optical reddening .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite argue against the dusty ionized absorber model based on the lack of strong fe i resonance absorption features which should attend the putative fe l - shell edges . the lack of intrinsic o i k - edges in the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectra of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 is further evidence against silicate dust .",
    "low resolution observations of ngc 4051 with exosat @xcite and asca @xcite indicated the presence of variable absorption features at 0.6 - 0.9 kev . these were interpreted as o vii and oviii edges from an ionized absorber along the line of sight to the x - ray continuum source .",
    "grating observations of ngc 4051 and several other sources reveal a more complicated picture .",
    "resonance absorption lines and unresolved transition arrays ( utas ) are responsible for much of the soft x - ray spectral complexity in seyfert galaxies . in hindsight",
    ", it is obvious that resonance absorption lines can be much stronger and appear at much lower column densities than photoionization edges .",
    "high resolution _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ grating spectra of the ionized x - ray and uv absorbers in ngc 4051 are reported by @xcite .",
    "there are multiple blue - shifted absorber components , and re - emission is seen from narrow x - ray lines .",
    "ngc 4051 is classified as a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) . in order to avoid confusion when talking about the different emission line regions , we refer to them as follows .",
    "the narrow - line region ( nlr ) has the lowest velocity and turbulent velocity ( fwhm@xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the broad - line region ( blr ) has larger velocity width ( @xmath5 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the relativistic - line region ( rlr ) has the largest velocity width ( @xmath6 km s@xmath4 ) and is also affected by gravitational redshift .",
    "note that this classification is based purely on velocity , which increases closer to the central black hole .",
    "we avoid a classification based on density , for as we shall show , both the nlr and blr ( and perhaps rlr ) encompass a large range of ionization parameter and density .    in this paper , we present the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectrum of ngc 4051 ( z = 0.00234 ) .",
    "our long ( 122 ks ) observation reveals unprecedented detail in the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "we interpret a very broad spectral feature as relativistic o viii emission from the inner accretion flow around the central black hole .",
    "we also fit models of the ionized absorber and emitter spectrum , including inner - shell absorption from a number of ions .",
    "we observed ngc 4051 for a full orbit with _ xmm - newton _ on 16 - 17 may 2001 .",
    "the om and epic light curves are reported by @xcite and the epic spectral variability is analyzed by @xcite and @xcite . the x - ray flux varied significantly during the observation with a period of particularly low flux approximately half way through @xcite . during the last 14 ks of the observation",
    "the particle background increased dramatically .",
    "we have excluded these data from the analysis .",
    "the spectrum during the 8.4 ks period of lowest flux ( `` low state '' , 0.3 - 2.0 kev epic pn+mos count rate @xmath7 count s@xmath4 ) was reduced separately from the remaining 99 ks ( `` high state '' ) of the observation .",
    "the rgs spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) was reduced using the _ xmm - newton _ sas v5.2 .",
    "the response matrices were corrected for imperfections in the effective area calibration using the data / model ratios from a power law fit to the rgs spectra of mrk 421 .",
    "after this correction the individual first and second order spectra from rgs1 and rgs2 were added together and the response matrices were combined accordingly .",
    "the absolute effective area of rgs is calibrated to better than 5% @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution of rgs in first order is fwhm@xmath8 m , and the wavelength calibration is accurate to 8 m  @xcite .",
    "these correspond to fwhm@xmath9 km s@xmath4 and @xmath10 km s@xmath4 at 35  .",
    "the spectral bins range from 20 - 40 m  in width from the low to high wavelength ends of the spectra , so we oversample by a factor of 2 - 4 .",
    "the high - state spectrum has 50 - 570 photons / bin , while the low - state spectrum has 2 - 22 photons / bin .",
    "there are enough photons / bin in the high - state spectrum to use @xmath11 poisson errorbars and fit our models using the @xmath12 statistic .",
    "for the low state , we use the c - statistic @xcite and plot asymmetric poisson errorbars @xcite .    the combined _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic , rgs and optical monitor ( om ) measurements @xcite constrain the photoionizing portion of the ngc 4051 spectral energy distribution ( sed , fig .",
    "the uv flux points at 2100 , 2300 , and 2900   were computed from the mean count rates in the uvw2 , uvm2 , and uvw1 bandpasses and corrected for galactic reddening @xcite .",
    "additional radio , ir , and optical flux points were obtained from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the soft x - ray slope of @xmath13 is from our best fit model to the high - state rgs data .",
    "the hard x - ray slope of @xmath14 is from the best fit pl to the high - state epic pn data .",
    "we assume that the sed has a high - energy cutoff above 100 kev .",
    "integrating over the sed , the bolometric luminosity is @xmath15 erg s@xmath4 and the ionizing ( 13.6 ev-13.6 kev ) luminosity is @xmath16 erg s@xmath4 during the high - state .",
    "we retrieved archival _",
    "hetgs observations taken during 2000 april 24 - 25 for comparison with the 2001 may _ xmm - newton _ data set .",
    "the medium energy grating ( meg ) data are most useful for assessing the nature of the soft x - ray excess , and have been analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "we reprocessed the meg @xmath17 order spectra from the level 1 event file using ciao 3.0.1 and the associated caldb 2.23 calibration database .",
    "we combined events from the entire 82 ks of the observation to get the mean spectrum .",
    "the two first order spectra were added and the resultant spectrum was rebinned to 0.05   to improve the statistics at long - wavelengths .",
    "this yielded 10 - 270 counts per bin , enabling us to use poisson errorbars and to use @xmath12 as a fit statistic .",
    "the unbinned meg spectra are too noisy to allow a meaningful analysis at the full 0.023   resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "the high state rgs spectrum of ngc 4051 is far from a simple power law ( fig .",
    "1 ) . there is a large soft x - ray excess over the underlying soft power law , apparent as a broad bump from 13 - 32  .",
    "the spectrum is punctuated by many narrow absorption lines , but there are no deep absorption edges .",
    "there are several narrow emission lines which contribute a small percentage of the soft excess seen in the lower resolution epic spectrum @xcite .",
    "the nature of the curvature in the soft spectrum is not obvious , and has previously been ascribed to blackbody emission @xcite .",
    "we use the imp ] ( v1.1 ) spectral fitting code developed at ucsb @xcite to fit the high - state rgs spectrum .",
    "all fits include galactic absorption with column density @xmath18 @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "they also include narrow absorption and emission from the intrinsic ionized outflow , which we discuss in detail below .",
    "we adopt a distance of 9.35 mpc , derived from the host galaxy kinematic redshift assuming @xmath20 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , to convert from flux to luminosity . unless otherwise stated , single parameter error estimates are for 90% confidence .",
    "we first try fitting a power law plus single temperature blackbody to the rgs spectrum ( fig .",
    "this model gives a formally poor fit ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the blackbody peak is broader than the observed soft excess .",
    "this is compensated by a deep o vii edge at 17   which appears to be overestimated by the model .",
    "the best fit temperature for the blackbody is @xmath22 kev , and the underlying power law has photon index @xmath23 .",
    "these are similar to the results of @xcite , who suggest that residuals to their blackbody fit represent additional spectral complexity from absorption .    a power law plus multicolor disk blackbody gives a worse fit ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the best - fit black hole mass for this model is @xmath25 .",
    "the inner radius of the accretion disk is @xmath26 , and the accretion rate is 60% of the eddington rate . while the model roughly fits the shape of the soft x - ray continuum , it underpredicts the uv flux and bolometric luminosity by a large amount ( fig .",
    "it is inconsistent with reverberation studies which yield a much larger black hole mass of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "for such a large central mass , a disk blackbody should peak in the far - uv , not the x - ray band .",
    "it is unlikely that the soft excess is the wien tail of a comptonized blackbody .",
    "we tested this possibility with the imp _ comptt _ model @xcite .",
    "the observed spectral slope is nt nearly steep enough , especially at the long wavelength end of the rgs spectrum .",
    "the shape of such a model is so far off , that we do not attempt to fit it to the data .",
    "a wien tail absorbed by neutral carbon in a dusty ionized absorber appears to be ruled out since there is no other indication of dust absorption in the spectrum of ngc 4051 .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also try a power law plus optically thin bremsstrahlung model ( fig .",
    "this gives a worse fit than the blackbody model ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the best fit plasma temperature is @xmath29 kev , and the emission measure is @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "because the roll - over in the bremsstrahlung spectrum is not steep enough to match the observed spectral bump , the model compensates by overestimating the o vii edge depth .",
    "conventional continuum emission processes can not explain the observed spectral bump , so we turn to discrete atomic processes . unlike mcg-6 - 30 - 15",
    "@xcite , the spectral break at 17   is much too broad to be explained by o vii k and fe",
    "i l photoionization edges from the ionized absorber . as we show below , the observed column densities of o vii and",
    "fe i in the ionized absorber are too small to give appreciable edges .",
    "next we model the soft x - ray spectrum with a power law plus relativistic o viii ly@xmath1 emission line .",
    "we assume line profiles from an accretion disk which may extend to the inner stable circular orbit of a maximally rotating kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the disk emissivity as a function of radius is assumed to follow a power law @xmath32 .",
    "the inner radius is allowed to vary , and the outer radius is fixed at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this model ( rel1 , @xmath35 ) does better than the blackbody model , but underestimates the flux in the 13 - 17   band ( fig .",
    "the extent of the red wing of the line is parameterized by an inner radius of @xmath36 , and a radial emissivity law with power law index of @xmath37 .",
    "the disk inclination is @xmath38 .    our best model ( rel2 ) of the spectrum ( fig .",
    "3a , b , c ) includes relativistic emission from the entire o viii emission line series and radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) .",
    "the line and rrc strengths are computed using the _ ionemit _ model , which is described in  3.3 .",
    "we assume that the o viii ion is photoionized , with an electron temperature of @xmath39 k ( consistent with @xmath40 , see  4.2 ) . for simplicity , we assume that all emitted line photons escape directly and do not treat their radiative transfer .",
    "radiative transfer effects could alter the observed line ratios .",
    "for example , ly@xmath2 photons may be down - converted to ly@xmath1 if the emission region is optically thick .",
    "the rel2 model has @xmath41 , a significant improvement over rel1 ( @xmath42 for one additional degree of freedom ) .",
    "the combined ly@xmath2 plus higher order lines account for the gradual steepening of the spectrum in the 13 - 17   band .",
    "we map cross - sections of the @xmath12 surface in ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) parameter space ( fig .",
    "4 ) , parameters which have the largest influence on the relativistic line shape . there is a well - localized minimum in each of these plots , demonstrating that we can accurately constrain disk parameters .",
    "we adopt the @xmath47 ( 99.7% ) confidence region for variation in two parameters as a conservative bound on these parameters , given possible systematic uncertainties in the underlying continuum shape and ionized absorber - emitter models .",
    "the breadth of the relativistic o viii line profiles is parameterized by an inner disk radius of @xmath48 at 99.7% confidence ( fig 4a , b , c ) . as far as we are aware , this is the closest distance to the event horizon of a supermassive black hole ever measured .",
    "if the line emission comes from outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , it implies a black hole spin parameter of @xmath49 , approaching the maximal value .",
    "emission from _ inside _ the isco is not excluded , but would require an extension of our model .",
    "the greatest uncertainty on the disk inner radius comes from modeling the underlying continuum . decreasing the power law index by 0.1 dex from the best fit value increases @xmath43 from 1.24 to 1.6 @xmath50 , and still yields and acceptable fit ( fig .",
    "4c ) .    there is some degeneracy between the disk emissivity index and the disk inclination ( fig .",
    "4c ) , since both affect the energy of the blue shoulder of the relativistic line profile .",
    "however , the emissivity index is still well constrained to be @xmath51 , at 99.7% confidence for variation in 2 parameters .",
    "this means that nearly all ( @xmath52 ) of the o viii emission comes from within 6 @xmath50 and the half - light radius is @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) . a steep radial emissivity law ( @xmath55 ) is predicted for a black hole accretion disk with non - zero torque at the isco @xcite .",
    "the relativistic lines in mrk 766 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite have emissivity indices of @xmath56 and half - light radii of @xmath57 , which are similar to this prediction .",
    "the radial emissivity index for the relativistic o viii line in ngc 4051 is much steeper , implying that it originates from a narrower range of radii .",
    "the energy of the blue shoulder of the relativistic o viii ly@xmath1 line profile is sensitive to and increases with disk inclination .",
    "the best - fit disk inclination for ngc 4051 is @xmath58 , again at 99.7% confidence for variation in 2 parameters .",
    "this value is correlated with @xmath59 , with steeper values of the emissivity index yielding larger disk inclination .",
    "we have not included smearing from compton scattering , which could lead to an overestimate of the energy of the blue shoulder and hence the inclination .",
    "it is also possible that a flare or warp to the inner disk or other time dependent structure will affect the inclination . with these caveats in mind , we find that the disk inclination in ngc 4051 is significantly different from the inclinations ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) inferred from the relativisitic line profiles in mrk 766 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite .",
    "this is to be expected from agn viewed at different angles .",
    "the disk inclination is also consistent with the @xmath62 inclination of the conical nlr outflow in ngc 4051 , derived from [ o iii ] imaging and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this alignment is remarkable given the much larger size scale of the nlr and may indicate an intimate connection between the nlr and accretion disk .",
    "the relativistic o viii ly@xmath1 flux is @xmath63 ph s@xmath4 @xmath19 and the equivalent width is @xmath64 ev . using a curve - of - growth analysis , the observed ew requires an o viii column density of @xmath65 @xmath19 for a reasonable turbulent width of @xmath66 km s@xmath4 @xcite and a covering fraction of unity .",
    "the o viii ly@xmath1 line is dominated by its damping wings in this region of parameter space .",
    "the sum of relativistic o viii line series equivalent widths is @xmath67 ev .",
    "the model ly@xmath1 to ly@xmath2 flux ratio is 3.8 - 4.7 , and the ratio of rrc to ly@xmath1 is 0.19 - 0.23 . the exact ratios depend on the o viii column density and doppler parameter in the accretion disk .",
    "these are not well constrained by the model fit , owing to severe blending of higher order lines and rrc .",
    "there are no relativistic lines from n vii or c vi in the ngc 4051 spectrum .",
    "we put upper limits ( at 90% confidence ) of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ph s@xmath4 @xmath19 on the ly@xmath1 fluxes of these two ions , assuming all of the relativistic line profiles are the same .",
    "the photon flux ratios with respect to o viii ly@xmath1 are then @xmath70 for n vii ly@xmath1 and @xmath71 for c vi ly@xmath1 .",
    "as we discuss in  4.2 , these limits are consistent with solar abundances in a highly ionized plasma . in comparison , the ratios observed in mrk 766 ( 1.0 and 0.8 , respectively ) are more difficult to explain @xcite .",
    "the underlying soft power law continuum in the rel2 model has @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 ) and a normalization of @xmath74 ph s@xmath4 @xmath19 @xmath4 ( at 1  ) .",
    "this yields a high - state 0.3 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath75 erg s@xmath4 from the soft power law .",
    "we note that other shapes for the soft x - ray continuum are conceivable , and the chosen continuum may have an affect on the relativistic line parameters .",
    "however , lacking a physical model for the continuum , a power law is often used and is consistent with the expectation of a compton - scattered accretion disk spectrum .",
    "we try adding an intrinsic neutral absorber to the rel2 model and find a best fit value of @xmath76 @xmath19 and no significant improvement in the fit .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite , who find an upper limit of @xmath77 @xmath19 from their _ chandra _ hetgs observation .",
    "the rgs spectrum has strong , narrow k - shell absorption lines from c v - vi , n vi - vii , o vii - viii , and ne ix ( fig .",
    "we detect weaker l - shell absorption lines from fe xvii - xx and inner - shell absorption from n iv - v , and o iv - vi .",
    "narrow h - like , he - like , and fe l - shell lines are also seen in emission .",
    "o vii and ne ix forbidden emission lines are particularly strong , since they are not absorbed .",
    "the large equivalent width of o vii f indicates a large global covering fraction for the x - ray nlr , estimated below .",
    "we infer that re - emission is important and fills many of the absorption lines , making them appear weaker .",

    "the column densities of the ions in the emitter and absorber are allowed to vary independently .",
    "we assume electron temperatures for the emitter in the range @xmath78 k , derived using xstar @xcite and the observed sed ( fig .",
    "the emission is normalized by @xmath79 , the product of the covering fraction and 0.3 - 10 kev luminosity of the soft x - ray power law .",

    "we are able to measure very accurate mean values for the absorber redshift and doppler parameter by including all of the observed absorption lines in our model fit .",
    "however , parameters for the absorber may depend on ionization state .",
    "they are also sensitive to redshifts and velocity widths of the resonance emission lines .",
    "the mean absorber parameters are consistent with the system observed at @xmath86 km s@xmath4 s@xmath4 ( @xmath87 km s@xmath4 ) with _ chandra _ hetgs @xcite",
    ". the outflow speed we measure may be slightly lower because our model takes into account filling in of absorption lines by emission lines .",
    "we do not detect the high velocity system at @xmath88 km s@xmath4 detected in the co - added hetg spectra of h - like ions @xcite .",
    "it is likely that such a summed absorption spectrum is contaminated by lines from other ions , especially fe l - shell lines .",
    "this procedure is also suspect because voigt profiles should be added logarithmically , not linearly .",
    "rgs does not have as much sensitivity as chandra to the high ionization lines at short wavelengths , so we can not make a definitive assessment of the presence of the high velocity system in the rgs spectrum .",

    "they range from @xmath89 @xmath19 for n iv to @xmath90 @xmath19 for o viii .",
    "we calculate peak ionic abundances using the xstar photoionization code and observed sed ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and use these to derive equivalent hydrogen column densities of @xmath91 to @xmath92 @xmath19 . there is a trend of increasing column density with increasing ionization parameter ( fig .",
    "the n ii ion ( below the ionization range plotted in fig .",
    "6 ) has an anomalously large column density ( table 1 ) .",
    "we expect a smaller column density than n iii , which is undetected , so we are suspicious of the n ii 1s-2p line identification .    the o vii and o viii column densities in the absorber correspond to k - edge optical depths of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . as we noted above , these weak edges have little effect on the shape of the continuum spectrum . in comparison ,",
    "@xcite find apparent oxygen edge depths of 3 - 4 times greater in their analysis of the hetg spectra .",
    "however , they conclude that these are inconsistent with an absorption line curve - of - growth analysis which indicates smaller column densities .",
    "we surmise that their overestimate of edge depths is due to an inaccurate continuum model and neglect of fe l - shell absorption . the upper limit on the fe i column density in the rgs spectrum ( table 1 ) corresponds to @xmath95 at the fe i l edge , and there is no other indication of silicate or iron oxide dust absorption .",

    "is pegged at @xmath98 , indicating that the bulk of the nlr lies interior to the absorber .",
    "this , plus the small difference in redshift between the absorber and emitter accounts for the partial filling in of the resonance absorption lines and the apparent absence of strong 2p-1s ( r ) resonance emission lines from n vii , o vii , oviii , and ne ix .",
    "the best - fit line - of - sight covering fraction of the continuum source by the absorber is also @xmath99 .",

    "10 , we are led to ask why certain regions of parameter space are filled and others are not . the outer radius of the blr may be set by the dust sublimation radius @xcite , with @xmath215 pc . for ngc 4051 , @xmath216 pc , which is close to the estimated blr outer radius in fig .",

    "10 is empty , indicating that the highest density emission line regions have @xmath219 @xmath31 .",
    "the accretion disk density may set this upper limit for the blr density , especially if it is the source of the blr plasma .",
    "the lack of emission lines from the blr with ionization greater than c vi may owe to insufficient s / n",
    ".    observations are qualitatively consistent with a model where the blr is formed as an accretion disk wind @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "gas from the disk is heated and rises to a location where it is exposed to and accelerated by uv photons .",
    "the velocity width of the broad lines is produced primarily by keplerian rotation , but radial velocity shear in the wind yields a single - peaked profile .",
    "the broad base of the line comes from close in while the narrow core arises further from the black hole .",
    "an accelerating outflow would naturally span a large range of densities at any given radius , from the density of the neutral disk surface to the much lower density , highly ionized c vi emitting region observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. the blr appears to span the entire range of allowed radii , from just outside the uv continuum emission region to where it merges ( perhaps seamlessly ) with the nlr . in the case of nls1s such as ngc 4051",
    ", the distinction between the blr and nlr may be artificial .",
    "the narrow n vi , o vii , ne ix , and si xiii emission lines require densities of @xmath220 @xmath31 at @xmath127 pc ( fig .",
    "these are below the critical densities of the forbidden lines ( @xmath221 ) and consistent with the observed ( @xmath222 ) line ratios @xcite .",
    "a low - state _ chandra _ acis - s image of ngc 4051 shows little extended emission @xcite .",
    "this is different from other nearby seyferts , including ngc 4151 , circinus , and ngc 1068 @xcite where the x - ray nlr is extended on the same size scale as the optical nlr .",
    "the optical [ o iii ] emission region has a smaller velocity width ( fwhm @xmath223 km s@xmath4 ) than o vii ( fig .",
    "10 ) , and extends to a maximum distance of 220 pc from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "( the contribution of the galactic stellar bulge to the virial mass dominates at these radii , leading to velocities of a couple hundred km s@xmath4 . )",
    "the [ o iii ] @xmath224 line has a critical density of @xmath225 @xmath31 , which puts a lower limit of @xmath226 pc ( 07 ) on its inner emission radius .",
    "this implies that there may be a separation between the x - ray and optical narrow line regions .",
    "the large fractional covering of the x - ray nlr by the ionized x - ray absorber requires the absorber to be at larger radius than the emitter ( @xmath127 pc ) .",
    "the conditions in the narrow absorber are likely to be similar to the emitter , but may have somewhat lower densities to attain the same ionization parameter at larger radius . if we assume they have the same density and radius , then the column densities in table 1 give a radial thickness of @xmath227 cm , and radial filling factor of @xmath228 for the ionized absorber - emitter .",
    "this small value , plus the large global covering fraction indicate a sheet - like morphology .",
    "the accretion disk inclination implies a lower limit on the uv - x ionization cone opening half - angle of @xmath229 . this is larger than the value of @xmath230 for the [ o iii ] conical outflow model @xcite .",
    "it appears that the [ o iii ] cone is narrower than the full ionization cone .",
    "the o vii global covering fraction yields a half - opening angle of @xmath231 for the x - ray ionization cone , which is larger than but consistent with the disk inclination angle . however , variability could cause us to overestimate the covering fraction and ionization cone opening angle .    we estimate the outflow rate of the o vii nlr ,",
    "assuming it resides in a thin shell of covering fraction @xmath131 . combining the equation of continuity with the definition of the ionization parameter @xmath182 ,",
    "the mass outflow rate is    @xmath232    where @xmath233 is the mean atomic weight per electron and @xmath234 km s@xmath4 is the observed radial outflow velocity of the absorber . using @xmath235 from our xstar simulation , @xmath236 from the o vii f equivalent width , and @xmath16 erg s@xmath4 , we find a large mass outflow rate of @xmath237 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is a robust result since we have directly measured most of the variables in equation 1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath238 comes directly from the emission line normalization , averaged over the entire emission region .",
    "the absorber radial velocity is probably a fair estimate of the mean flow velocity .",
    "the estimated mass outflow rate is a factor of @xmath239 greater than the nuclear accretion rate , assuming an efficiency of @xmath169 (  4.1 ) .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the outflow is a significant fraction ( @xmath240 ) of the ionizing luminosity of the agn , but only a small fraction ( @xmath241 ) of the bolometric luminosity",
    ". a lower ( but still suprisingly large ) mass outflow rate of @xmath242 yr@xmath4 ( 10 times the accretion rate ) is found for the o vii nlr of the broad - lined seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 @xcite .",
    "if agn outflows are driven by radiation pressure , then there may be a connection between the near - eddington luminosity of ngc 4051 and its large outflow rate .",
    "if this wind escapes the black hole , then the supply of fuel to the agn will be exhausted more rapidly by outflow than by accretion .",
    "a number of intrinsic uv absorption systems are observed by _ hst _ , with velocities ranging from @xmath243 to @xmath244 km s@xmath4 , in ions si ii - iv , c ii - iv , and n v @xcite . the uv absorber components 1 - 4 are the closest in velocity ( -647 to -337 km s@xmath4 ) to the x - ray absorbers we observe with _ xmm - newton_. the n v @xmath245 lines appear to be saturated and",
    "@xcite do not give column density estimates for them .",
    "we predict a mean optical depth of the n v @xmath246 line of @xmath247 from the n v column density ( table 1 ) and the uv line width of 730 km s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore we expect the uv lines to be nearly saturated , based on our x - ray observations .",
    "a similar result is found for ngc 5548 by @xcite , who compare _ xmm - newton _ and _ fuse _ observations of o vi lines .    there is a strong trend in the ionized absorber - emitter of increasing column density with ionization parameter ( fig .",
    "a linear least - squares fit to a power law @xmath248 ( including only absorber @xmath249 ) gives an index of @xmath250 and intercept of @xmath251 .",
    "a similar trend is found in ngc 5548 by @xcite , with slope in the range 0.25 to 0.5 .",
    "however , a power law gives a formally poor fit to the absorber column density distribution in ngc 4051 .",
    "the distribution appears to peak at @xmath252 , with the column density dropping off at higher ionization parameter .",
    "the ionization distribution of the absorber may either be continuous or consist of discrete phases .",
    "the 3.7 decades of ionization parameter observed in the ngc 4051 outflow ( fig .",
    "6 ) require at least 2 phases .",
    "two - phase models have been suggested as a way to confine photoionized clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "more than one phase may exist at pressures where the heating curve is multi - valued @xcite .",
    "we construct the heating curve for ngc 4051 ( fig .",
    "12 ) using xstar and the sed ( fig .",
    "2 ) . we place absorber ions at their ionization parameters of peak abundance and find that not all ionization phases can be in pressure equilibrium . while there do exist segments of vertical slope and marginal stability on the curve ,",
    "these only apply for the high ionization species n vii - fe xx .",
    "the pressure of the lowest ionization phase of the absorber is as much as 100 times greater than the pressure of the high ionization phases ( fig .",
    "it is a common property of seyfert galaxies that the lower ionization uv and x - ray absorbers have lower column densities than their high ionization x - ray counterparts . while uv column density measurements are in some cases plagued by saturation and partial covering effects , this is less of a problem for the lower optical depth k - shell absorption lines in the x - ray spectrum @xcite . in the case of ngc 4051 , the n vii absorber carries 100 times as much mass as the o iv absorber",
    "this must be telling us something fundamental about how the nlr clouds are produced . comparing figs .",
    "6 and 12 , it appears that the highest column density ions , n vii - fe xx , may reside in regions of marginal stability , perhaps confirming the prediction of @xcite .",
    "however , the lower ionization species must exist out of pressure equilibrium and may be rapidly destroyed by expansion and photoionization heating .",
    "this may potentially explain their lower column density .",
    "gas pressure confinement is not necessary in a dynamic outflow which is continually replenished by the accretion disk .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ rgs observations of ngc 4051 demonstrate the capability of high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy to uncover the nature of agn accretion and outflows at scales ranging from just outside the black hole event horizon to the narrow line region .",
    "the soft x - ray excess emission is a combination of continuum and relativistic emission line components .",
    "it is incorrect to fit this with simple models such as a power law or blackbody .",
    "it is important to get the continuum model correct for fitting the spectra of ionized absorbers .",
    "conversely , it is essential to account for ionized absorption in order to accurately measure the underlying continuum and relativistic emission lines .",
    "we successfully model the soft x - ray excess in the spectrum of ngc 4051 as a power law plus relativistic o viii emission , including ly@xmath1 , higher - order emission lines , and recombination continuum .",
    "the line profiles require emission from inside the last stable orbit of a schwarzschild black hole , or emission close to the last stable orbit of a kerr black hole .",
    "the relativistic emission line region has an inner radius of @xmath253 , which may indicate a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "the accretion disk is viewed at a relatively high inclination of @xmath254 .",
    "together with the reverberation mass of @xmath255 , this confirms that ngc 4051 contains a relatively low - mass black hole .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 4051 is quite different from those of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 .",
    "the relativistic o viii line in ngc 4051 is considerably broader , and there is no indication of relativistic n vii or c vi emission lines .",
    "the lack of relativistic c vi and n vii emission is consistent with solar abundances and a high ionization parameter ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "this contrasts with mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk 766 , which require super - solar abundances or resonance fluorescence effects to explain strong n vii emission .",
    "photoionization modeling indicates that the relativistic line emission comes from the thin , high density ( @xmath257 @xmath31 ) photoionized skin of the accretion disk .",
    "the @xmath258 ev equivalent width of o viii ly@xmath1 can consistently be produced in the this layer , with an additional contribution from higher order lyman transitions .",
    "we fit an ionized absorber - emitter model for several ions in the narrow - line spectrum of ngc 4051 .",
    "the ions cover nearly 4 decades of ionization parameter .",
    "the column density increases with ionization parameter , with high ionization states carrying more mass than lower ionization states .",
    "the absorber and emitter have similar ionic column densities , and the x - ray nlr is covered by the absorber , indicating that the two arise in the same region . the large global covering fraction and high velocity of the x - ray nlr",
    "imply a mass outflow rate which is @xmath239 times greater than the accretion rate .",
    "an analysis of the heating curve in the photoionized absorber shows that the low ionization uv - x absorber can not be in pressure equilibrium with the higher ionization phases of the x - ray absorber .",
    "we find evidence for doppler - broadened c vi and o vii emission lines in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the c vi emission line has a velocity width of 1200 km s@xmath4 , similar to the uv and optical broad lines .",
    "this may indicate a high ionization component within the blr of ngc 4051 .",
    "the implied large range of densities and observed p - cygni line profiles are consistent with the blr arising in an accretion disk wind .",
    "a very broad ( fwhm @xmath259 km s@xmath4 ) o vii line may arise in the innermost regions of the blr , just exterior to the uv emitting portion of the accretion disk .",
    "observation of ngc 4051 during a low x - ray flux state shows high equivalent width narrow emission lines .",
    "the x - ray nlr does not respond to rapid x - ray continuum variations , consistent with its estimated 0.02 pc size scale .",
    "however , we find evidence for low ionization fe uta absorption during the low - state , which is not present during the high state .",
    "the source is too weak during the low state to measure the relativistic o viii feature .",
