    "over the past several years , the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been confirmed by many astronomical observations , but its exact nature is still unknown . the annihilation or decay products of dm like photons , neutrinos and antimatter particles may be observed by dm indirect detecting experiments . among these methods , detecting positrons or anti - protons from dm is a challenge due to the background induced by cosmic - rays or other astrophysical sources and various uncertainties during anti - matter propagation .",
    "recently pamela satellite experiment reported an excess in flux ratio of positrons to the sum of electrons and positrons around @xmath12 to @xmath13 while the flux ratio of anti - proton to proton has no obvious deviation from the prediction from cosmic - rays @xcite .",
    "in addition , the atic reported the total flux of electrons plus positrons spectrum measurement up to @xmath14 in which there is a bump over the background around @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these results provide a new perspective to dm research which has quite different features compared to `` popular '' candidates in the literatures .",
    "the atic electron / positron excess suggests a heavy dark matter around @xmath17 . to accommodate the pamela results",
    ", the dm seems to be leptophilic to avoid the anti - proton excess ( if the measured anti - matter particles are produced in the nearby dm subhalo @xcite or we use some special cosmic - ray propagation models @xcite , this constraint may be loosen ) . for the annihilating dm , there is a significant mismatch , namely the expected thermal - dm annihilation cross - section is much smaller than those required by pamela and atic measurements .",
    "there is a class of dm scenarios which can satisfy all past experiments .",
    "the extraordinary prediction of this scenario is that there are some new light scalars or gauge bosons to mediate dm sector ( eg.@xcite ) .",
    "the exchange of light mediator should increase the dm annihilation cross section at low velocity , such as in the galaxy today , comparing with the velocity in the epoch of freeze - out due to the so - called `` sommerfeld enhancement '' @xcite . moreover",
    "if such mediators are the only products from dm annihilation and they are light enough to forbid the decays into baryons , the dm will produce only charged leptons . in this scenario such mediator may actually interact with all the standard model(sm ) particles through the mixing with sm @xmath18 gauge field or higgs field ( eg.@xcite ) .",
    "instead we can impose the new symmetry to make sure that the mediator only interacts with leptons , at least at the tree - level @xcite .",
    "for example the mediator can be the gauge boson of an extra @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the number of i - th generation of lepton .",
    "this model is anomaly free due to the cancelation between two generation of leptons with opposite @xmath2 charge . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the search on this kind of light new gauge boson at besiii detector .",
    "it is the well - motivated scientific goal to search for such light boson @xmath19 at the low - energy @xmath20 colliders due to its possible leptophillic feature .",
    "obviously @xmath19 should not contradict with the known measurements , such as anomalous magnetic moments of charged leptons @xmath21 , @xmath22 scattering cross section , @xmath23.@xcite .",
    "provided that the x is light , the interactions between @xmath19 and sm particles should be weak .",
    "however the signals of x at colliders may be heavily polluted by large qed backgrounds . on the other hand",
    ", the invisible decay of x , i.e. x decays into final states which do not interact with detector , is promising because the irreducible sm backgrounds arise from neutrino which is suppressed by @xmath24 for low energy linear collider @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that missing energy measurements are always challenging from the experimental point of view .",
    "thus the detection of light gauge boson at the low - energy experiments is a great challenge . as a result",
    ", large luminosity is required in order to collect enough events and suppress qed backgrounds .    in this paper , we extend our previous investigation on light new gauge boson @xcite to @xmath25 at besiii detector . in the previous work @xcite , the possibilities of detecting @xmath26 new gauge boson , usually called u - boson in the literature , has been scrutinized .",
    "such @xmath26 u - boson is used to explain the excess of 511 kev photon line which was observed by integral @xcite .",
    "in fact , research on extra light gauge boson has a long history @xcite .",
    "the main production process at low - energy colliders can be @xmath27 .",
    "if the u - boson have invisible decay channel to dm @xcite , the detection will benefit from small sm backgrounds @xmath28 .",
    "if the u - boson decays into charged lepton pairs , the sm background is @xmath29 . for the sm backgrounds , @xmath30 is smoothly distributed .",
    "instead the signal peaks around the mass of u - boson , the invariant mass of lepton pair should be utilized to distinguish the events from the backgrounds .",
    "thus the detection of such u - boson strongly depends on the mass resolution and the integrated luminosity of the experiment .",
    "provided that the u - boson obtained the mass via the spontaneously symmetry breaking of a new scalar field , there is at least one extra scalar particle in the particle spectrum .",
    "such scalar particle may also be detected at the low energy colliders , provided its mass are within the reach of these colliders . in this paper",
    "we do not focus on this investigation and allocate it to the further studies .",
    "recently , some authors did the investigations of such new light gauge boson at low energy experiments @xcite . the discussions at @xmath20 colliders often concentrate at b - factory and @xmath31-factory .",
    "they investigated the processes of @xmath27 and meson decay @xcite , scalar strahlung @xcite @xmath23 . in the context of u - boson mixing with sm particle . in this paper , we consider a gauge boson in the model with extra @xmath3 gauge group which will be described in the next section .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in the section",
    "ii , we describe the @xmath3 model with an extra light u - boson , as well as the constraints from current low energy experiments . in section iii , we discuss the influences of such gauge boson in the epoch of dm freeze - out and in the galaxy today .",
    "we found that the coupling between dm and u - boson is about @xmath32 while the allowed couplings between sm fermion and u - boson are small . in section iv",
    ", we simulated the signals and backgrounds for u - boson at the besiii detector .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are given in the last section .",

    "this gauge group is broken by a sm singlet scalar higgs field @xmath36 which gives the u - boson mass around @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath37 ( @xmath38 denotes any particle ) , where @xmath39 is gauge coupling constant of the extra @xmath2 interaction , and @xmath40 is the extra u(1 ) charge of a particle . besides the sm lagrangian",
    ", the additional lagrangian may be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the field strength for u - boson and the gauge boson b of @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "@xmath45 is the covariant derivative , @xmath46 is the @xmath36 field potential , and @xmath47 is the lagrangian which describes the interactions of dm sector",
    ".    generally speaking , the mixing parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 among the new bosons and sm bosons are not zero , but they tend to be small due to the limits from low energy experiments . if we forbid these mixing parameters at the tree level , they will be induced from the higher order contributions .",
    "but the interactions by higher order contributions are usually small @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we neglect the mixing effects for simplicity .",
    "the scalar potential can be written as @xmath50 .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath36 with the vacuum expectation value @xmath51 , u boson obtains mass to be @xmath52 . in our work we do not work on the possibility of searching light scalar @xmath36 which has been discussed in the ref .",
    "there is also an extra heavy particle @xmath53 as the candidate of dm in the model .",
    "the particle @xmath53 can be a scalar or vector - like fermion ( such choice is the simplest way to construct anomaly - free model ) with mass around @xmath54 which is favored by atic experiment . the lagrangian of dm can be written as @xcite @xmath55    the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are important in the dm sector , but they have negligible effects on the low - energy experiments .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is important in both sectors and it mediates the interactions among the dm and the sm particles .",
    "note that the interactions between u - boson and leptons are vector - like and the u - boson couples also with the neutrinos .",
    "in addition , the @xmath59 couplings @xmath60 are universal for two generations of leptons .",
    "these couplings have been constrained by many known low energy measurements . from these observations , the constraint on the contributions to the anomalous magnetic moments of the charged leptons @xmath61 induced by u - boson are very stringent .",
    "the additional contributions from u - boson for a vector - like interactions is given by @xcite @xmath62    for the @xmath63 , following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have the constraint @xmath64 . for the @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we impose conservative constraints as @xmath67 and @xmath68 by using the results from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref.@xcite respectively .",
    "another stringent constraint for vector - like coupling arises from low-@xmath69 neutrino - electron scattering @xcite as @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the universal leptonic couplings can be written as @xmath71 . combing all these constraints",
    ", the coupling @xmath72 should be smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "from section ii , we can see that the couplings among u - boson and sm particles are small .",
    "however the couplings among u - boson and dm can be large .",
    "it is quite natural to assume the main products of dm annihilations are light u - bosons . in this section",
    "we will investigate the magnitude of couplings among u - boson and dm from cosmological point of view .    at the high temperature , the u - boson can reach the equilibrium with the charged leptons and neutrinos . the thermal relic density of dm , only for s - wave ,",
    "is given by @xcite    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the planck mass of @xmath76 .",

    "the results can be written as    @xmath86    if the dm also carries extra @xmath2 charge , the cross section requires an extra factor @xmath87 for averaging initial dm charge @xcite .",

    ", width=316 ]    the light u - boson may enhance the dm annihilation cross section at low velocity in the galaxy today due to the non - perturbative effect named `` sommerfeld enhancement''(a complete analysis can be found in the ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this non - relativistic quantum effect arises because the two particle wave functions are distorted away from plane wave by the presence of a potential if their kinetic energy are low enough . in the language of quantum field theory",
    ", it corresponds to the contribution of ladder diagrams due to the exchange of some light scalars or gauge bosons during two incoming dm particles undergoing some annihilation reaction . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the exchange of a scalar boson or a vector boson would give the same result@xcite .",
    "this enhancement can be described by a factor @xmath36 which is defined as a factor to multiply with the tree level dm annihilation cross section , @xmath93 .",
    "this factor is essential to interpret the difference between the dm cross section required by the correct thermal relic density and the pamela / atic positron anomaly .    in order to calculate s",
