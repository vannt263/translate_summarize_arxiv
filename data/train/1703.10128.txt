    "rapid experimental advances in the creation of finite systems of ultracold atoms using few optical traps ( bottom - up ) @xcite or through the use of extended optical lattices ( top - down ) @xcite are promising approaches toward realization of feynman s vision of a quantum simulator @xcite , capable of finding solutions to systems that are otherwise numerically and/or analytically intractable .",
    "however , apart from a few double - well investigations @xcite , to date model - independent microscopic studies of multiwell systems providing theoretical insights and guidance to experimental efforts are largely lacking .    here we introduce a configuration - interaction ( ci ) schrdinger - equation methodology @xcite for exploring finite plaquette systems assembled from individual optical traps ; for a brief description of the ci method , see appendix [ cime ] .",
    "these systems are fundamental stepping stones toward bottom - up realization of large scale checkerboard or square ulracold atom lattices which are promising candidates for emulating the physics underlying @xmath3-wave high - t@xmath4 superconductivity @xcite in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the work described here , demonstrating the feasibility of such exact ci calculations for interatomic contact interactions , can be extended to electronic plaquettes , i.e. , to quantum - dot - arrays , governed by long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows :    in section [ sp ] we explore first the properties of ultracold fermionic atoms ( @xmath0li ) confined in a single square plaquette ( 4-sites ) in the regime of hole pairing , and subsequently analyze the entanglement physics of two coupled plaquettes in the hole - pairing regime .    in section [ dp ] , for the `` hole - doped ''",
    "coupled plaquettes ( 8-sites , six atoms ) , we analyze the wave function anatomy of the entangled @xcite ( schrdinger - cat ) two almost - degenerate manifolds , comprising : ( @xmath5 ) the ground state ( gs ) and 1st excited ( 1ex ) state , and ( @xmath6 ) the two higher excited states ( 2ex and 3ex ) .",
    "the almost - degenerate states have good , but opposite , parities .",
    "when symmetry - broken ( sb )  either by superposing @xmath7 the degenerate pair in each manifold , or via offsetting the energies ( tilting ) of the two plaquettes  the sb states coming from @xmath5 are characterized by a particle ( `` charge'')-density modulation ( `` wave '' ) , i.e , a cdw portraying the hole - paired , ( 4,2 ) or ( 2,4 ) , components , whereas the sb states originating from @xmath6 remain in a ( 3,3 ) particle distribution ( each of the plaquettes having an unpaired hole ) , but exhibit a spin - polarizarion density modulation ( `` wave '' ) , i.e. , a sdw . for the the double - plaquette case , we further explore effects brought about by breaking the symmetry between two weakly - coupled plaquettes , either by distorting one of the plaquettes , or by tilting and detuning one of the plaquettes with respect to the other .",
    "spectral changes caused by increased tunnel coupling ( e.g. , by decreased inter - plaquette distance ) between the two plaquettes are also considered .",
    "noteworthy is our finding that the gs @xmath3-wave resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state contributes only partially to the exact many - body wave function ",
    "i.e. , double occupancies ( referred also as doublons ) need be included .",

    "a similar type of potential energy surface , made of the assembly of plaquettes  each comprising four sites ( potential wells ) arranged in a square geometry  has been introduced in early investigations @xcite of electronic high - temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials , in the context of the two - dimensional hubbard model often mentioned as a starting point for formulating a theoretical understanding of unconventional superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model has been originally derived for the description of the behavior of strongly correlated electrons in solids @xcite .",
    "however , variants of this model have also been implemented , for over a decade , targeting investigations of strongly - interacting ultracold atoms ( bosonic or fermionic ) in optical lattices , with the interest in such systems originating from remarkable advances in atom cooling and optical trapping techniques , that opened heretofore untapped prospects of preparing , emulating , and measuring the behavior of strongly - interacting quantum many - body systems under pristine , defect - free , environments .",
    "analysis of such ultracold - atom emulations of interacting quantum many - body systems revealed on various occasions @xcite that many hubbard models that were simulated with ultracold atoms were found not to have a standard form  meaning that the corresponding hamiltonians , required for analysis of these results , frequently had to incorporate terms that are not included in the standard hubbard model and its customary variants .",
    "these extra terms may include correlated and occupation - dependent tunneling within the lowest band , as well as correlated tunneling and occupation of higher bands @xcite .",
    "the above findings connote that progress in developing future ultracold - atom emulations of interacting quantum many - body systems ( including quantum magnetism and the origins of unconventional pairing mechanisms ) , and theoretical methods for the analysis of such emulations ( including the development and implementation of effective models , such as extended and non - standard hubbard hamiltonians ) , require benchmark exact calculations ( such as the ones introduced in this work ) , which owing to their ab - initio nature incorporate ( with no restriction or approximation ) all contributions to the many - body microscopic hamiltonian . with such computational methodology , one",
    "can then proceed to construct , assess , and improve effective models for a reliable analysis of the new forthcoming data . indeed , in this work we focused on providing benchmark exact quantum - mechanical solutions , aiding and enabling a bottom - up approach aimed at ultracold atoms experiments , and their analysis , starting from a single ultracold atom plaquette as a building block , and progressing in a systematic manner to double plaquettes ( with variable inter - plaquette couplings ) and larger , more complex , systems .",
    "our exact schrdinger - equation ultracold - fermionic - atoms - plaquette simulations demonstrated entangled @xmath3- and @xmath61- wave rvb states coexisting with partial double occupancies , uncovered hole - pairing phase diagrams , and explored the robustness of the energy spectrum and entanglement of a double - plaquette system ( assembled from entangled - multipartite - plaquettes ) through symmetry - breaking via interplaquette tilting and distortion and as a function of the strength of interplaquette coupling .",

    "[ fig2_t](c , d ) , it is clear that ( i ) is fulfilled . to assure that the possible error due to ( ii ) is as small as possible , we minimize @xmath192 where @xmath193 represents the volume under the sr - cpd2 hump at position @xmath131 .      for the ground state sr - cpd2 shown in fig .",

    "it uses chebychev polynomials as an efficient and highly accurate approximation of the true wave functions . from the documentation :    `` the implementation of chebfun is based on the mathematical fact that smooth functions can be represented very efficiently by polynomial interpolation in chebyshev points , or equivalently , thanks to the fast fourier transform , by expansions in chebyshev polynomials '' ; and `` chebfun makes use of adaptive procedures that aim to find the right number of points automatically so as to represent each function to roughly machine precision , that is , about 15 digits of relative accuracy . ''    we have confirmed the accuracy of these solutions with both symbolic and numeric calculations in mathematica and the agreement was excellent at significantly higher performance .",
    "to obtain numerical solutions to the hubbard model we use the software package sneg @xcite , which is a `` mathematica package for symbolic calculations with second - quantization - operator expressions '' . from the documentation :    `` sneg library is a mathematica package that provides a framework for performing calculations using the operators of the second quantization with an emphasis on the anti - commuting fermionic operators in the context of solid - state and atomic physics .",
