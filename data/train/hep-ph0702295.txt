    "now at @xmath191 we have argued above that the imaginary part of the potential has a straightforward interpretation .",
    "let us consider the potential precisely at the value of @xmath1 defined by @xmath192 .",
    "beginning at @xmath193 , the potential contains power singularities at @xmath192 , as explained in section  2 in the context of the pure scalar theory .",

    "@xcite  amount essentially to the statement that the region of validity of @xmath0 is curtailed by the requirement that @xmath199 ; and they propose that the region of validity of @xmath0 be defined by the inflection point in the potential ( if this occurs a scale below @xmath162 ) , which we see from fig",
    ".  5 indeed occurs at the point where @xmath26 changes sign as described above .",
    "they further conclude that this model does not exhibit the vacuum instability described above ; for @xmath55 the ground state of the theory is at @xmath118 , and the potential is a convex function within its region of validity ( simply because this region is curtailed at the inflection point .",
    "we simply disagree with this analysis ; as we have described above , the work of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite demonstrate quite convincingly , in our opinion , that the potential has meaning in its non - convex region ; and we see no reason to require that @xmath199 .",
    "as usual , we need to require , for perturbative believability , that relevant expansion parameters are `` sufficiently '' small ; and in our examples , since we use renormalisation group - improved perturbation theory , at large @xmath1 these parameters are simply the dimensionless couplings evaluated at a scale commensurate with @xmath1 in the uv region .",
    "it seems clear to us , therefore , that for the choice of parameters used in fig .  5 , we can certainly conclude that the local minimum @xmath118 is unstable .",
    "it is essentially for the same reason that we disagree with refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "there the claim is that the calculation of the potential in a theory without a uv cut - off disagrees with same calculation with a cut - off and that the latter agrees with simulation data .",
    "we claim , however , that the exhibition of this disagreement occurs invariably in regions of parameter space where perturbation theory is not to be trusted .",

    "perturbation theory breaks down because either @xmath58 or @xmath26 become large .",
    "this has , therefore , no bearing on our discussion above , where we are always careful to confine our conclusions to regions of parameter space where perturbation theory is expected to remain valid .",
    "we turn now to the interesting case when @xmath119 .",
    "the analysis of this can be done with the full rg apparatus developed above , but it is both interesting and illuminating to mimic the original simplified cw treatment of scalar qed . let us suppose for simplicity that @xmath200 . for this range we have seen in section  2 that @xmath26 approaches zero as @xmath73 increases . for @xmath84",

    "this shows , however , that if we define the renormalisation scale to be equal to @xmath206 at the minimum , the resulting relation between @xmath26 and @xmath58 still depends on the details of the subtraction procedure . ]",
    "@xmath207 .    returning to the case",
    "@xmath25 it should now be clear that the preceding analysis will remain valid to a good approximation so long as @xmath208 , as in fact is the case for the values we chose to produce fig .  5 .",
    "in fact , at the maximum of @xmath3 displayed in fig .  5 , we find that @xmath209 while @xmath210 .",

    "( [ dimtrans ] ) is for the same reason as we described above in the cw case , simply a matter of renormalization conventions . ]    in a derivation based on the rg - improved form of the potential ( eq .  ( [ eq : vrg ] ) or its derivative eq .",
    "( [ eq : dvrg ] ) ) eq .",
    "( [ dimtrans ] ) is replaced by the equation  @xcite 4 + _ = 0 , but the essential features of the calculation are unaffected .",
    "we might note that the yukawa model is more amenable to perturbative treatment than scalar qed . in the latter case , while the existence of a local minimum could be unambiguously demonstrated perturbatively , the behaviour of the potential both in a neighborhood of the origin as well as for large field values was beyond the realm of perturbation theory . in our case , we are able to treat both the origin and the maximum perturbatively , with the breakdown of perturbation theory restricted to large values of the field .",
    "the only caveat on this discussion is that the coupling @xmath212 be sufficiently small so that it is in the perturbative regime . according to our discussion in the previous section",
    ", there is then always a scale @xmath26 at which the relation ( [ dimtrans ] ) holds . to conclude ,",
    "in the case @xmath31 the origin is metastable and decays to a region where eventually the couplings are strong . once again , whether the theory has no ground state or is replaced at high scales by a modified theory can not be determined within this framework .",
    "there is hardly a more compelling application of radiative corrections than dimensional transmutation , yet it is completely missed by the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite and overlooked in lattice results , ref .",
    "@xcite , whose range of mass parameters does not include this important region .",
    "finally , we consider the case @xmath214 at the classical level , the scalar field behaves as in the case of the @xmath22  model discussed in section  [ subsec : phi4 ] , i.e. , the potential has minima at @xmath215 where v^2=. the theory undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking , and the scalar gets a mass @xmath216 with @xmath217 as a result , each fermion also gets a mass @xmath218 the ratio of the masses is = = .",
    "radiative corrections to this classical behaviour will shift the values of the minima and the masses , but so long as perturbation theory holds , must be large compared to the scale @xmath219 associated with dimensional transmutation in the @xmath220 case .",
    "otherwise , the form of the effective potential will be more complicated than assumed here .",
    "] this qualitative behaviour is unchanged .",
    "the remainder of the discussion can be inferred from the behaviour of the running couplings .",
    "generically , @xmath221 the behaviour for large field values leads us to choose the scale @xmath144 to be @xmath222 to avoid large logs ; and the uv behaviour of @xmath223 has been discussed in detail in section  2 . for small values of the field , however the potential is not given correctly by choosing @xmath224 when the field is small compared to the masses of the scalar and the fermions , they both decouple .",
    "the theory in the infrared is just that of a set of @xmath54 massive free fermions and a massive free scalar , so the running of the couplings below these masses is not correctly given by a mass - independent renormalization scheme .",
    "the study of the possible  vacuum instability has a long history and a substantial literature .",
    "the first comprehensive treatment from an rg perspective was in ref .",
    "@xcite ; subsequent refinements included a particularly lucid discussion in ref .",
    "the situation in the  is similar to the yukawa model we have considered , in that the one loop fermion contribution to @xmath3 potentially destabilises the electro - weak vacuum ; however it differs in that onset of the instability is associated with another , deeper , minimum of the potential ( which may still occur within the perturbative regime ) .",
    "the deeper minimum can occur because while the top quark yukawa coupling contribution to the evolution of the higgs self - coupling @xmath26 evolution tends to push it down towards ( or through ) zero in the uv , the yukawa coupling itself gets smaller in the uv due to the gauge coupling contributions to its evolution .",
    "therefore eventually the gauge coupling contributions to the evolution of @xmath26 cause it to recover to positive values .",
    "it is easy to verify this from the explicit expressions for the @xmath11-functions  @xcite , which for convenience we reproduce below .",
