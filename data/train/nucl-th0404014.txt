    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite parametrize the non - perturbative hadron structure in hard exclusive processes ( for comprehensive reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of gpds would provide information which is usually encoded in both the elastic form factors and the usual parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and , at the same time , it would represent a unique way to access several crucial features of the nucleon @xcite , such as its angular momentum content @xcite and its structure in the transverse plane @xcite . according to a factorization theorem derived in qcd @xcite ,",
    "gpds enter the long - distance dominated part of exclusive lepton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off hadrons .",
    "in particular , deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , i.e. the process @xmath3 when @xmath4 , is one of the the most promising to access gpds ( here and in the following , @xmath5 is the momentum transfer between the leptons @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath2 the one between the hadrons @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , relevant experimental efforts to measure gpds by means of dvcs off hadrons are likely to take place in the next few years . as a matter of fact",
    ", a few dvcs data have been already published @xcite .",
    "recently , the issue of measuring gpds for nuclei has been addressed .",
    "the first paper on this subject @xcite , concerning the deuteron , contained already the crucial observation that the knowledge of gpds would permit the investigation of the short light - like distance structure of nuclei , and thus the interplay of nucleon and parton degrees of freedom in the nuclear wave function .",
    "in standard dis off a nucleus with four - momentum @xmath10 and @xmath11 nucleons of mass @xmath12 , this information can be accessed in the region where @xmath13 , being @xmath14 and @xmath15 the energy transfer in the laboratory system . in this region measurements",
    "are very difficult , because of vanishing cross - sections .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the same physics can be accessed in dvcs at much lower values of @xmath16 .",
    "the usefulness of nuclear gpds has been stressed also for finite nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that they could provide us with peculiar information about the spatial distribution of energy , momentum and forces experienced by quarks and gluons inside hadrons .",
    "since then , dvcs has been extensively discussed for nuclear targets .",
    "impulse approximation ( ia ) calculations , supposed to give the bulk of nuclear effects at @xmath17 , have been performed for the deuteron @xcite and for spinless nuclei @xcite . for nuclei of any spin ,",
    "estimates of gpds have been provided and prescriptions for nuclear effects have been proposed in @xcite . recently , an analysis of nuclear dvcs has been performed beyond ia , with estimates of shadowing effects and involving therefore large light - like distances and correlations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it was found that these effects are sizable up to @xmath18 , i.e. up to larger values of @xmath19 with respect to normal dis .",
    "besides , the possibility of measuring dvcs at an electron - ion - collider has also been established in @xcite .",
    "the study of gpds for @xmath1 is interesting for many aspects .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is a well known nucleus , for which realistic studies are possible , so that conventional nuclear effects can be safely calculated .",
    "strong deviations from the predicted behaviour could be therefore ascribed to exotic effects , such as the ones of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , not included in a realistic wave function .",
    "besides , @xmath1 is extensively used as an effective neutron target . in fact",
    ", the properties of the free neutron are being investigated through experiments with nuclei , whose data are analyzed taking nuclear effects properly into account .",
    "recently , it has been shown that unpolarized dis off three body systems can provide relevant information on pdfs at large @xmath16 @xcite , while it is known since a long time that its particular spin structure suggests the use of @xmath1 as an effective polarized neutron target @xcite . polarized @xmath1",
    "will be therefore the first candidate for experiments aimed at the study of spin - dependent gpds in the free neutron , to unveil details of its angular momentum content .    in this paper , an impulse approximation ( ia ) calculation of the quark unpolarized gpd @xmath0 of @xmath20",
    "is presented .",
    "a convolution formula is derived and afterwards numerically evaluated using a realistic non - diagonal spectral function , so that fermi motion and binding effects are rigorously estimated .",
    "the proposed scheme is valid for @xmath21 and despite of this it permits to calculate gpds in the kinematical range relevant to the coherent , no break - up channel of deep exclusive processes off @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the latter channel is the most interesting one for its theoretical implications , but it can be hardly observed at large @xmath2 , due to the vanishing cross section @xcite .",
    "the nuclear gpds obtained here are therefore a prerequisite for any calculation of observables in coherent dvcs off @xmath1 , although they can be compared neither with existing data , nor with forth - coming ones .",
    "a detailed analysis of dvcs off @xmath1 , with estimates of observables , such as cross - sections or spin asymmetries , is in progress and will follow in a separate publication .",
    "thus , the main result of this investigation is not the size and shape of the obtained @xmath0 for @xmath1 , but the size and nature of nuclear effects on it . this will permit to test directly , for the @xmath1 target at least , the accuracy of prescriptions which have been proposed to estimate nuclear gpds @xcite , providing a useful tool for the planning of future experiments and for their correct interpretation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the notation used is introduced in section 2 , together with the derivation of the main result , a convolution formula obtained from an ia analysis .",
    "such a formula is used to evaluate the numerical results shown in section 3 and thoroughly discussed in section 4 , where the most interesting outcome of the present study is to be found .",
    "eventually , conclusions are drawn in the fifth section .",
    "the formalism introduced in ref .",

    "i stress again that the main point of the present study is not to produce realistic estimates for observables , but to investigate and discuss nuclear effects , which do not depend on the form of any well - behaved internal gpd , whose general structure is safely simulated by eqs .",
    "( [ hdd ] )  ( [ for ] ) . for the moment",
    "being , only the @xmath120 part of @xmath53 is therefore calculated ; if one wanted to estimate the dvcs cross - sections , also the quark singlet and the gluon contributions would be certainly necessary . as already said ,",

    "the coefficients @xmath150 and @xmath151 are simply chosen assuming that the contribution of the valence quarks of a given flavour to the f.f .",
    "of @xmath1 is proportional to their charge .",
    "one should remember that the normalization of the f.f . has been chosen in eq .",

    "( [ app0 ] ) is exactly obtained by placing @xmath152 , i.e. no fermi motion effects and no convolution , into eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) .",
    "in the present situation the ratio eq .",

    "one should note that the prescription suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for finite nuclei in the valence quark sector , basically assuming that the nucleus is a system of almost free nucleons with approximately the same momenta , has the same @xmath2 dependence of the prescription eq .",

    "some general trends of the results are apparent :    \\i ) nuclear effects , for @xmath155 , are as large as 15 % at most .",
    "larger effects at higher @xmath141 values are actually related with the vanishing denominator in eq .",

    "\\v ) nuclear effects for the @xmath126 flavour are larger than for the @xmath125 flavour .",
    "the behaviour described above can be explained as follows . as already said in section 2 , in ia and in the forward limit , at @xmath157",
    "one basically recovers the spectral function normalization and no nuclear effects , so that the ratio eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) slightly differs from one .",
    "this is not true of course in the present case , due to nuclear effects hidden not only in the @xmath59 dependence , but also in the @xmath60 one , according to its definition , eq . ( [ xi1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , even if @xmath158 , in the present situation the ratio eq .",
    "( [ rnew ] ) does not give the spectral function normalization as in the forward case , because of the @xmath2 dependence .",
    "one source of such dependence is that , in the approximation eq .",
    "( [ app0 ] ) , it is assumed , through eqs .",
    "( [ fu3 ] ) and ( [ fd3 ] ) that the quarks @xmath125 and @xmath126 , belonging to the protons or to the neutron in @xmath1 , contribute to the charge f.f . in the same way , being the contribution proportional to their charge only .",
    "actually , the effect of fermi motion and binding is stronger for the quarks belonging to the neutron , having the latter a larger average momentum with respect to the proton @xcite .",
    "this can be seen noticing that the pointlike f.f . , eq .",
    "( [ ffp ] ) , for the proton , shows a stronger @xmath2-dependence , with respect to the neutron one , the difference being 17 % ( 23 % ) at @xmath159 gev@xmath135 ( @xmath160 gev@xmath135 ) .",
    "the prescription given by eqs .",
    "( [ fu3 ] ) and ( [ fd3 ] ) could be correct only if the pointlike f.f .",
    "had a similar @xmath2 dependence . besides , nuclear effects studied by means of the ratio eq .",
    "( [ rnew ] ) at fixed @xmath40 and @xmath33 depend on @xmath2 , showing clearly that such a dependence can not be factorized , i.e. the nuclear gpd can not be written as the product of a @xmath2 dependent and a @xmath2 independent term , confirming what has been found for the deuteron case in ref .",
    "one should notice that , if factorization were valid , figs .",
    "6 and 7 would be equal .",
    "this fact clearly indicates that a model based on the assumption of factorization , such as the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , is not motivated and can not be used to parametrize nuclear gpds for estimates of dvcs cross sections and asymmetries for light nuclei .",
    "the fact that nuclear effects are larger for the @xmath126 distribution is also easily explained in terms of the different contribution of the spectral functions for the protons and the neutron , the latter being more important for the gpds of the @xmath126 rather than for the ones of the @xmath125 flavour .",
    "this has been already shown in the forward case in fig . 2 , and shortly commented in the previous section . when the @xmath2-dependence is studied , the effect found in the forward case increases , being impossible , as explained above , to really obtain the @xmath125 and @xmath126 contributions to the @xmath1 f.f . by means of a simple charge rescaling , as it is done in eqs .",
    "( [ fu3 ] ) and ( [ fd3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the approximation eq .",
    "( [ fd3 ] ) for the @xmath126 flavour is worse than the approximation eq .",
    "( [ fu3 ] ) for the @xmath125 flavour , the disagreement increasing with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "one finds that @xmath161 given by eq .",
    "( [ fu3 ] ) differs from the one calculated through eq .",
    "( [ ffc ] ) by 4 % ( 6 % ) at @xmath153 gev@xmath135 ( @xmath162 gev@xmath135 ) , while for the @xmath126 flavour the disagreement reaches 9 % ( 13 % ) for the same value of the momentum transfer .",
    "this flavour dependence is to be expected for any target with isospin different from zero .",
    "as already said , the calculation of dvcs observables is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "anyway , a first rough estimate of nuclear effects on dvcs observables can be already sketched .",
    "in fact it is known that the point @xmath163 gives the bulk of the contribution to hard exclusive processes , since at leading order in qcd the amplitude for dvcs and for meson electroproduction just involve gpds at this point , which is therefore also the easiest region to access experimentally .",
    "in order to figure out how fermi motion and binding affect the `` slice '' @xmath164 , the ratio ( [ rnew ] ) for @xmath163 , is shown in fig .",
    "8 , as a function of @xmath165 , for the flavor @xmath125 .",
    "it can be seen that even in this crucial region nuclear effects are systematically underestimated by the approximation eq .",
    "( [ app0 ] ) , up to a maximum of 8% for the flavor @xmath125 .",
    "the issue of applying the obtained gpds to calculate dvcs off @xmath1 , to estimate cross - sections and to establish the feasibility of experiments , as it has been done already for the deuteron target in ref .",
    "@xcite , is in progress and will be presented elsewhere . in particular , the contributions of the incoherent break - up channel , and of the shadowing effects , beyond ia , at @xmath166 , have to be evaluated . besides , the study of polarized gpds will be very interesting , due to the peculiar spin structure of @xmath1 and its implications for the study of the angular momentum of the free neutron .",
    "in this paper , a realistic microscopic calculation of the unpolarized quark gpd @xmath167 for @xmath1 is presented . in an impulse approximation framework ,",
    "a convolution formula has been obtained where fermi motion and binding effects are properly taken into account through an off - diagonal spectral function .",
    "the range of validity of the scheme is @xmath168 gev@xmath135 , the most relevant for the coherent channel of hard exclusive processes .",
    "the forward limit and the @xmath40-integral of the obtained @xmath167 are formally and numerically in agreement with the theoretical and experimental knowledge of the @xmath1 nucleus .",
    "nuclear effects are found to be larger than in the forward case and to increase with @xmath2 at fixed @xmath33 , and with @xmath33 at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "in particular the latter @xmath2 dependence does not simply factorize , in agreement with previous findings for the deuteron target and at variance with prescriptions proposed for finite nuclei . moreover , nuclear effects are found to be larger for the @xmath126 flavour than for the @xmath125 one , being the target non isoscalar . in particular , it has been shown that nuclear effects are as large as 8 % , even at the crucial point @xmath163 .",
    "the shown results represent a prerequisite for any calculation of dvcs observables .",
    "the evaluation of these quantities , to establish the feasibility of experiments , is in progress and will be presented in a later paper , together with the contributions of the incoherent , break - up channel , and of shadowing effects , beyond ia , at small values of @xmath169 .",
    "the present analysis is also a first step towards a complete study of the gpds for @xmath1 , which could provide , in the polarized case , with an important tool to unveil details of the angular momentum structure of the free neutron .",
