    "stein surfaces have been intensively studied in some form by complex analysts since the early 20th century .",
    "the most basic question , how plentiful stein surfaces are , still remains wide open in various ways .",
    "for example , any open subset @xmath0 of a complex surface @xmath2 inherits a complex structure , so one may ask how commonly open subsets of @xmath2 satisfy the stein condition .",
    "this is already a deep classical problem when @xmath3 . in the present paper ,",
    "we show that stein open subsets of a complex surface @xmath2 are ubiquitous in the following sense : if @xmath0 satisfies the most basic topological condition necessary for the existence of a stein structure , then after a suitable adjustment it becomes stein as an open subset of @xmath2 .",
    "the adjustment is quite mild from a point - set topological viewpoint  in particular , the homeomorphism type of @xmath0 is preserved , as well as the essential data of the topological embedding in @xmath2 .",
    "however , the differential topology is radically altered .",
    "the diffeomorphism type of @xmath0 is typically changed , and frequently there are uncountably many possibilities for the resulting diffeomorphism type .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to state and prove the simplest form of the above existence result ( theorem  2.4 ) , while developing the necessary background material .",
    "we also describe stronger results which will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "there are many equivalent ways of defining stein surfaces .",
    "perhaps the most efficient is that a _ stein surface _ is a complex surface ( so the real dimension is 4 ) that admits a biholomorphic embedding as a closed subset of @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "( a more relevant characterization will be given in section  4 . ) by the maximum modulus principle , stein surfaces are never compact , but they might be considered the most natural generalization of compact khler surfaces .",
    "global analysis such as seiberg - witten theory extends from the compact setting to the stein setting @xcite , because the stein condition imposes `` pseudoconvexity '' at infinity , which has the effect of allowing suitable boundary conditions for the analysis .",
    "there is an analogous notion of convexity in symplectic geometry , leading to the concept of a weinstein symplectic manifold @xcite , @xcite , but for our present purposes the complex analytic setting is more natural .",
    "( we return to the weinstein case in the last paragraph of the paper . )",
    "it is important to note that , unlike affine algebraic surfaces , stein surfaces need not have finite topology .",
    "equivalently , a stein surface need not be diffeomorphic to the interior of a compact 4-manifold with boundary .",
    "in fact , infinite topology is central to the construction in this paper , so the resulting smooth manifolds are typically `` exotic . '' to apply seiberg - witten theory to such manifolds , for example , one must observe that they can be written as infinite nested unions of stein surfaces with finite topology .",
    "( this at least gives information about compactly supported objects , for example the minimum genus of a representative of a fixed homology class . )",
    "the most basic question we can can ask about stein surfaces is how plentiful they are .",
    "we can make this question less vague in two different ways  considering stein surfaces as abstract manifolds or as open subsets of complex surfaces .",
    "[ q ] ( a ) which open , oriented 4-manifolds admit stein structures ?",
    "\\(b ) in a fixed complex surface @xmath2 , how common are open subsets @xmath0 that are stein surfaces in the complex structure inherited from @xmath2 ?    the second question is already interesting for the simplest complex surface @xmath3 .",
    "such open subsets are classically called `` domains of holomorphy . ''    to address these questions , it is convenient to use the language of handlebody theory . recall that a _ @xmath6-handle _ attached to the boundary of an @xmath7-manifold is a `` thickened up '' @xmath6-cell , that is , a copy of @xmath8 smoothly attached along @xmath9 , with the corners smoothed .",
    "the central @xmath6-cell @xmath10 is called the _ core _ of the handle . a",
    "_ handle decomposition _ is a decomposition of a manifold into handles , essentially a thickened up @xmath11-complex , cf .  figure  1 . in the context of open manifolds ,",
    "we build the handlebody first , then remove its boundary .",
    "handlebody theory is equivalent to morse theory : a proper morse function to @xmath12 , such as height in figure  1 , determines a handle decomposition on its domain , with each index-@xmath6 critical point determining a @xmath6-handle ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that all smooth manifolds admit handle decompositions .",
    "[ handledecom ]    question  [ q](a ) was answered by eliashberg @xcite , at least in principle .",
    "his theorem is cleanest for higher dimensional _ stein manifolds _ ( complex @xmath7-manifolds embedding as closed subsets of @xmath4 ) .",
    "it was classically known that every stein manifold @xmath2 admits a proper morse function to @xmath12 with critical points whose indices never exceed the complex dimension , or equivalently , a handle decomposition whose indices never exceed the middle ( real ) dimension .",
    "in addition , the complex structure on @xmath2 determines an almost - complex structure ( complex vector bundle structure on @xmath13 ) .",
    "surprisingly , these conditions are also sufficient for the existence of a stein structure in high dimensions .",
    "[ yasha ] @xcite . for @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth @xmath15-manifold with an almost - complex structure @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath2 is the interior of a ( possibly infinite ) handlebody whose indices are all @xmath17 , then @xmath2 admits a stein structure homotopic to @xmath16 .",
    "since the existence of an almost - complex structure is a homotopy - theoretic question , eliashberg s theorem characterizes manifolds admitting stein structures in purely topological terms .",
    "the method also applies when @xmath18 ( and the statement is well - known when @xmath19 ) . in the @xmath18 case , almost - complex structures always exist ( since we are dealing with oriented manifolds homotopy equivalent to 2-complexes ) .",
    "however , a framing obstruction arises , that always vanishes for @xmath20 , but is nontrivial for 2-handles on 4-manifolds .",
    "thus , eliashberg characterizes oriented 4-manifolds admitting stein structures as being interiors of handlebodies with all indices @xmath21 and an additional condition on the normal twisting of the 2-handle attaching maps .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite for a careful statement . ) while this is a purely topological characterization ( and can be expressed entirely in terms of kirby diagrams ) , it is somewhat difficult to apply in practice ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the @xmath18 case of theorem  [ yasha ] might be true as stated , even though it does nt follow from eliashberg s method .",
    "in fact , it already fails for the simplest example with a 2-handle : @xmath22 clearly satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem , being a 0-handle with a 2-handle attached in the simplest way .",
    "it is even complex @xmath23 .",
    "however , seiberg - witten theory @xcite , @xcite implies that any smoothly embedded , homologically essential sphere in a stein surface must have homological self - intersection number @xmath24 , so @xmath25 rules out the existence of a stein structure . on the other hand , we might take inspiration from freedman s revolutionary work @xcite , @xcite : while the main theorems of high - dimensional differential topology fail miserably in dimension  4 , they tend to work if we ignore smooth structures and analyze the underlying topological manifolds . by combining freedman s machinery with eliashberg s , one obtains theorem  [ yasha ] up to _",
    "homeomorphism_.    [ g ] @xcite . an oriented , topological 4-manifold @xmath2 is homeomorphic to a stein surface if and only if it is the interior of a ( possibly infinite ) topological handlebody with all indices @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , every homotopy class of almost - complex structures on @xmath2 is then realized by such ( orientation - preserving ) homeomorphisms .    in dimension 4 ,",
    "topological handlebodies are uniquely smoothable ( since we are gluing along 3-manifolds ) .",
    "see @xcite for why almost - complex structures can be pulled back through homeomorphisms , up to homotopy .",
    "this theorem implies , for example , that there are stein surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath26 ( but of course not diffeomorphic to it ) , and in fact their chern classes ( hence , canonical classes ) realize all even multiples of the generator of @xmath27 .    to address question  [ q](b ) , we first observe that an open set @xmath28 has no chance of being stein unless it has a handle decomposition with all indices @xmath21 .",
    "thus it suffices to consider open sets obtained by suitably thickening embedded 2-dimensional @xmath11-complexes . for a topologically",
    "embedded 2-complex @xmath29 , a neighborhood @xmath0 of @xmath30 will be called a _ thickening _ of @xmath30 if there is a homeomorphism @xmath31 onto the interior of a handlebody , sending cells to cores of handles .",
    "that is , there is a bijection between @xmath6-cells of @xmath30 and @xmath6-handles of @xmath32 for each @xmath6 , and @xmath33 sends each cell to the core @xmath34 of the corresponding handle together with a collar of @xmath35 that is radial with respect to the normal disks @xmath36 of the lower - index handles .",
    "( see figure  [ fig2 ] . )",
    "a complex @xmath29 will be called _ tame _ if a thickening exists .",
    "this rules out wild embeddings analogous to alexander s horned sphere .",
    "any two thickenings of a fixed @xmath29 will be homeomorphic ( @xmath37 and preserving handles ) , although not necessarily diffeomorphic",
    ". we can ask whether they are topologically ambiently isotopic ( so they correspond under a homeomorphism @xmath38 that is isotopic to @xmath39 , i.e. , homotopic to @xmath39 through homeomorphisms ) .",
    "we may first need to topologically radially shrink the thickenings slightly to avoid technical difficulties at the boundary .",
    "( for example , the annuli @xmath40 in @xmath41 are ambiently isotopic to each other for all @xmath42 , but the case @xmath43 poses difficulties . )",
    "then it seems plausible that the thickenings should be ambiently isotopic , but the question is apparently still open .",
    "our main theorem now gives an answer to question  [ q](b ) , by asserting that stein open subsets @xmath28 are as common as possible , up to shrinking at the boundary and topological ambient isotopy .",
    "that is , the existence of any thickening implies ( up to isotopy ) the existence of a stein thickening isotopic to it after shrinking .",
    "[ fig2 ]    [ main ] let @xmath29 be a tame , topologically embedded @xmath11 2-complex in a complex surface , and choose @xmath44 .",
    "then after an @xmath45-small topological ambient isotopy of @xmath30 , an @xmath45-neighborhood of @xmath30 contains a thickening @xmath0 of @xmath30 that is stein in the complex structure that @xmath0 inherits as an open subset of @xmath2 .    by construction , the stein thickening @xmath0 becomes topologically ambiently isotopic to the originally chosen thickening @xmath46 , once we shrink @xmath0 and @xmath46 at their boundaries .",
    "a fancier construction @xcite renders the shrinking unnecessary , provided that @xmath47 is suitably tame .",
    "if @xmath30 is infinite , we may take @xmath45 to be a positive function on a neighborhood of @xmath30 .",
    "[ spheres ] ( a ) we consider @xmath48 , the simplest complex of dimension  2 . a smooth",
    "_ 2-knot _ is a smooth embedding @xmath49 .",
    "the theory of smooth 2-knots @xmath30 is even richer than classical knot theory .",
    "for example , all classical knot groups ( as well as other groups ) arise as smooth 2-knot groups @xmath50 , and @xmath51 plays a role as well .",
    "for any 2-knot @xmath52 , the theorem supplies a stein surface @xmath53 that remembers the original knot type .",
    "for example , @xmath30 and the closure of @xmath0 have complements with the same homotopy groups ( although one must look carefully at the proof to see this , due to possible complications along the boundary of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the stein surface @xmath0 is homeomorphic to @xmath22 ( since @xmath30 clearly has vanishing homological self - intersection number , so its normal bundle is trivial ) .",
    "thus we obtain a plethora of counterexamples to the conjecture of @xcite that no stein open subset of @xmath54 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath0 is clearly not diffeomorphic to @xmath26 , since @xmath55 can not be generated by a smoothly embedded sphere .",
    "( this shows the necessity of the topological isotopy  @xmath0 can not contain the original smooth sphere @xmath30 or anything smoothly isotopic to it , although by construction it contains a topological sphere topologically isotopic to @xmath30 ) .",
    "one can arrange for the minimal genus of a smooth surface generating @xmath55 to be any preassigned positive integer .",
    "thus , each 2-knot @xmath30 corresponds to infinitely many diffeomorphism types of stein surfaces @xmath0 , distinguished by the minimal genus of the generator . on the other hand , one can identify a single diffeomorphism type that can be realized by stein thickenings ( after topological isotopy ) of all smooth 2-knot types , and such universal diffeomorphism types can be found with arbitrary nonzero minimal genus .",
    "it is not known if topological 2-knots @xmath56 exist that have topological @xmath22 thickenings but can not be smoothed by a topological isotopy .",
    "if so , one would expect that no universal diffeomorphism types exist for their stein thickenings , but any finite collection of topological 2-knots must ( after isotopy ) have a common diffeomorphism type of stein thickenings .",
    "\\(b ) to get more complicated embeddings @xmath57 , start with a classical knot @xmath58 ( smooth embedding @xmath59 ) , and let @xmath60 denote the handlebody obtained by attaching a 2-handle to a 0-handle @xmath61 along @xmath62 , with the normal directions to @xmath58 matched up so that @xmath60 has trivial intersection pairing .",
    "the knot @xmath58 is called ( topologically or smoothly ) _ slice _ if @xmath60 embeds ( topologically or smoothly ) in @xmath63 ( or equivalently , in @xmath64 ) .",
    "for example , if the alexander polynomial @xmath65 is 1 , then @xmath58 is topologically slice with @xmath66 homotopy equivalent to @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "an embedding of @xmath60 determines an embedding @xmath30 of @xmath48 with a unique locally knotted point @xmath68 , at which we see the cone on @xmath58 in @xmath61 .",

    ", we obtain an entire knot theory for such singular 2-spheres @xmath30 .",
    "for example , if @xmath71 we obtain topological knot complements in @xmath63 realizing all the homotopy types of smooth 2-knot complements , by ambiently connected summing smooth 2-knots with the homotopy-@xmath67 case mentioned above .",
    "many knots with @xmath71 are known not to be smoothly slice , so the corresponding singular topological 2-knots @xmath30 can never be isotoped to singular smooth 2-knots whose singularities are smooth cones .",
    "( that is , the embedded tame 2-complexes @xmath30 are unsmoothable . )",
    "however , the theorem still applies , and the discussion of ( a ) goes through without significant change , except that the resulting stein surfaces in @xmath54 will all be homeomorphic to @xmath70 rather than to @xmath72 , while they are still homotopy equivalent to @xmath48 .",
    "( the minimal genus can still be taken to be arbitrarily large , although we lose precise control over it , and we still obtain universal diffeomorphism types in the smooth setting for a fixed , smoothly slice @xmath58 . )    the multitude of smooth structures we encounter here leads us to consider the quintessential phenomenon of open 4-manifold smoothing theory : exotic @xmath63 s .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that uncountably many exotic @xmath63 s admit stein structures .",
    "these smooth manifolds embed smoothly in the standard @xmath63 .",
    "subsequently , l.  taylor @xcite showed that uncountably many exotic @xmath63 s ( that do not embed in @xmath63 ) require 3-handles in their handle decompositions , so they can not support stein structures .",

    "[ r4 ] there is a family of open subsets of @xmath54 ( with compact closure ) that are stein and homeomorphic to @xmath63 , but realize uncountably many diffeomorphism types ( with the cardinality of the continuum in zfc set theory ) .",
    "the usual way of finding an uncountable family of exotic @xmath63 s is to identify one exotic @xmath63 topologically with @xmath63 , then consider open balls of all sufficiently large radii .",
    "these topological balls inherit exotic smooth structures that can frequently be distinguished .",
    "the family in the above theorem arises in such a manner , with the stein open subsets corresponding to radii lying in a cantor set .",
    "once we have such a family , we can connect it by a 1-handle to any @xmath0 as in theorem  [ main ] and obtain a version of :    [ uncountable ] for @xmath75 nonempty , the neighborhood @xmath0 given by theorem  [ main ] lies in a family of stein thickenings of @xmath30 , nested ( with compact closure in each other if @xmath30 is compact ) with the order type of a cantor set , and realizing uncountably many diffeomorphism types .",
    "every nonempty stein open subset @xmath53 contains an uncountable nested family of stein open subsets homeomorphic to @xmath0 , but with no two diffeomorphic .",
    "the structure of such families will be considered in more detail in section  7 and in @xcite .",
    "similar ( and sometimes stronger ) results can be obtained for other cases of @xmath29 .",
    "one would expect to essentially always obtain such uncountable collections of diffeomorphism types , but distinguishing these in complete generality seems beyond the range of present technology .",
    "[ spheres2 ] for an embedded sphere @xmath75 as in example  [ spheres](a ) or ( b ) , we obtain an uncountable family of nested stein surfaces corresponding to the given knot type , realizing uncountably many diffeomorphism types .",
    "this phenomenon is independent of the countably infinite families of the previous examples : we can find a family as in theorem  2.7 for which the minimal genus of a generator is any fixed @xmath76 in ( a ) and fixed but arbitrarily large in ( b ) , or arrange the minimal genus to increase without bound as the stein surfaces get smaller .",
    "we can assume the intersection of the stein surfaces is a sphere topologically ambiently isotopic to @xmath30 , and that this is smooth except at a single point ( aside from the smooth cone point @xmath68 in ( b ) ) .",
    "most of the remainder of this paper is devoted to a proof of main theorem  [ main ] , together with relevant background material . in the final section  7",
    ", we will comment on the proofs of some of the remaining claims of this section , and present some additional observations . more systematic and general statements and proofs",
    "will appear in @xcite .",
    "our first tool for proving main theorem  [ main ] involves embedded surfaces .",
    "suppose @xmath77 is a compact , connected , oriented surface ( so @xmath78 ) smoothly embedded ( or immersed ) in a complex surface @xmath2 .",
    "it is natural to ask how the complex structure of @xmath2 relates to @xmath77 .",
    "we observe that there may be points @xmath79 at which the ( unoriented ) tangent space @xmath80 is a complex line ; we call these _",
    "complex points_. generically , @xmath77 has only finitely many complex points .",
    "this suggests counting complex points with suitable signs to obtain an index .",
    "we can define the sign of a complex point to be @xmath81 if and only if the complex orientation agrees with that of @xmath77 .",
    "however , there is also a second , more subtle , notion of sign , leading to the distinction between elliptic and hyperbolic points ( which should also be familiar to contact geometers ) , and resulting in two independent integer invariants ( tracing back , e.g. , to @xcite ) . while the details are not crucial for this paper , we state them for completeness : the grassmann bundle @xmath82 of oriented real 2-planes on @xmath2 has a pair @xmath83 of codimension-2 subbundles , consisting of complex lines , positively and negatively oriented .",
    "the bundle @xmath84 can be interpreted as a section of @xmath82 over @xmath77 , so it has intersection numbers with @xmath85 yielding the required pair of integers .",
    "these invariants , repackaged by linear combination , can be recognized as familiar characteristic classes : the chern number @xmath86 and the sum @xmath87 of normal and tangent euler numbers .",
    "if @xmath77 is _ totally real _",
    ", i.e. , if @xmath77 has no complex points , then both invariants must vanish by definition . by a harder result of eliashberg and harlamov , these are the only obstructions .",
    "[ real ] @xcite .",
    "a surface @xmath88 as above is smoothly isotopic to a totally real surface if and only if @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , when both invariants vanish , eliashberg and harlamov connect canceling pairs of complex points by arcs in @xmath77 , and then eliminate the complex points by a @xmath90-small twist of @xmath77 fixing each arc but rotating its normal directions .",
    "( see also @xcite for more details and @xcite for a more general version . )",
    "the theorem is intended to apply rel boundary when @xmath91 . in that case",
    ", one needs suitable framings on @xmath92 to interpret the characteristic classes .",
    "generically , @xmath77 has no complex points on @xmath92 , so the tangent and outward normal vector fields @xmath93 and @xmath7 along @xmath92 are a complex framing of @xmath94 for defining @xmath95 , and multiplying by @xmath96 sends @xmath93 to a normal vector field to @xmath77 along @xmath92 defining the relative euler class @xmath97 .",
    "( of course , the topological euler characteristic @xmath98 is also the tangent euler number relative to @xmath93 in this case . )",
    "our method for constructing stein surfaces is taken from eliashberg s paper @xcite proving theorem  [ yasha ] .",
    "we will illustrate the method by attempting to prove a smooth version of main theorem  [ main ]  so the open cells of @xmath30 are smoothly embedded , the isotopy is smooth , and the thickenings come from smoothly embedded handlebodies . we are doomed to fail , even for the simple case @xmath99 , but the method works for some pairs @xmath29 .",
    "it is instructive to see how the method fails in general , so we can ultimately fix the proof by passing to the topological setting and invoking freedman theory .",
    "the morse functions @xmath100 discussed prior to eliashberg s theorem  [ yasha ] ( with all indices @xmath101 ) are actually _ plurisubharmonic _ functions .",
    "these are essentially characterized as having level sets @xmath102 that are all _ pseudoconvex_. in complex dimension  2 , this is the same as saying that the complex line field determined on each @xmath102 ( by the complex structure ) is a contact structure that is positive in the boundary orientation on @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite or chapter  11 of @xcite for further discussion . ) by a theorem of grauert @xcite , a complex manifold with a proper plurisubharmonic function to @xmath12 must be stein , so stein manifolds are characterized by the existence of these functions .",
    "eliashberg builds his stein manifolds as complex manifolds with plurisubharmonic morse functions , extending the complex structure and function one handle at a time . in the case of stein",

    "it is possible to solve some explicit cases , by directly computing the invariants and arranging them to vanish , but one can not expect completely general results from this approach .",
    "we now introduce the necessary elements of topological 4-manifold theory , with historical motivation . by the 1960 s , differential topology in high dimensions",
    "@xmath143 had become a mature field , thanks to powerful theorems for reducing topological questions to algebraic ones  notably , the surgery and @xmath144-cobordism theorems . the proofs of these theorems failed in dimension  4 , and little was known about 4-manifolds before 1980 .",
    "the failure of the proofs can be traced to a key step called the _",

    ", we can group the extra intersection points in pairs with opposite sign , then connect each pair by an arc in each submanifold , to obtain a circle @xmath134 as in figure  3(a ) .",

    "thus the fundamental question of 4-manifold theory is when immersed disks can be replaced by embedded disks , or equivalently , embedded 2-handles .",
    "a major assault on this problem was launched by casson in the 1970 s @xcite .",
    "as he observed , a _ kinky handle _",
    "@xmath58 , or closed tubular neighborhood of a generically immersed 2-disk in a 4-manifold , is most obviously distinguished from a 2-handle by its fundamental group : each _ kink _ ( self - intersection ) contributes a generator to this free group .",
    "one can recover a contractible space by attaching a 2-cell for each kink .",
    "in fact , casson located a framed link @xmath148 in @xmath149 , disjoint from the attaching region @xmath150 , such that attaching 2-handles along @xmath148 transformed @xmath151 into a 2-handle @xmath152 .",
    "we can now rephrase the fundamental question : given an embedding @xmath153 ( where we can take the 4-manifold @xmath2 to be the complement of a neighborhood of the surfaces we wish to separate by the whitney trick ) , when can we find embedded 2-handles in @xmath154 attached along @xmath148 ? such 2-handles would transform @xmath58 into the desired 2-handle .",
    "unfortunately , the new embedding problem seems even harder than the original .",
    "while this may have stopped lesser mathematicians , casson proceeded to show that , after suitable modification of the original immersion , one can at least find disjoint kinky handles attached to @xmath148 .",

    "[ freedman ] @xcite .",
    "every casson handle is homeomorphic to an open 2-handle .",
    "suddenly the whitney trick and high - dimensional topology worked for topological 4-manifolds ( first for trivial @xmath164 , then later for many other fundamental groups @xcite ) .",
    "immediate consequences included the 4-dimensional poincar conjecture , a complete classification of closed , simply connected topological 4-manifolds , and a fields medal for freedman .",
    "( some credit is also due for quinn @xcite , for strengthening the conclusion of the classification theorem . )",
    "the main question left open , whether casson handles might actually be diffeomorphic to open 2-handles , was answered negatively by donaldson s contemporaneous work ( yielding another fields medal ) : one can not usually even find a smoothly embedded disk in a casson handle , bounded by the attaching circle in @xmath166 ; otherwise the high - dimensional machinery would run smoothly , contradicting many results from gauge theory .",
    "fortunately , donaldson s work did not precede freedman s ; otherwise topological 4-manifold theory might never have been developed .",

    "however , we do obtain the following :    [ quinn ] @xcite .",
    "a possibly exotic 2-handle @xmath169 always contains an unknotted casson handle @xmath162 attached along @xmath134 .    here , _",
    "unknotted _ means that the topological core of @xmath162 given by freedman s theorem is topologically ambiently isotopic in @xmath46 @xmath170 to the topological core @xmath171 of @xmath46 .",
    "quinn had to settle for a `` weakly unknotted '' casson handle ; we prove the stronger statement using more modern technology .",
    "this theorem was originally assumed to be of limited use , since it only gives a casson handle where we already have a topological 2-handle . basically , it only replaces an arbitrary exotic 2-handle by a slightly better understood exotic 2-handle .",
    "however , we will find this upgrade crucial for creating stein thickenings , and quinn s proof will be an important part of our construction for theorem  [ main ] .",
    "while the given homeomorphism @xmath172 can not be smoothed near @xmath132 , quinn uses freedman theory to investigate where @xmath33 _ can _ be smoothed .",
    "his handle straightening theorem ( 2.2.2 of @xcite ) is based on showing that a homeomorphism can be smoothed ( isotoped to a diffeomorphism ) outside of a small neighborhood of a smooth 2-complex with special properties .",
    "thus a homeomorphism of an open 0- or 1-handle that is a diffeomorphism on the boundary can be smoothed near its core , simply by smoothly isotoping the core away from the 2-complex via transversality , whereas this fails for 2-handles . in the latter case , however , his theorem shows that we can avoid the problematic 2-complex by smoothly homotoping @xmath132 @xmath173 to a suitable generically immersed disk @xmath174 .",
    "then we can assume @xmath33 is a diffeomorphism near @xmath34 , so @xmath175 is a smoothly immersed disk in @xmath46 with @xmath145 .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath175 , rather than any generic smoothing of the map @xmath176 , is that the kinky handle @xmath58 in @xmath72 obtained by thickening @xmath34 can be turned into a 2-stage tower with no kinks at the second stage  and furthermore , this tower in @xmath72 is smoothly ambiently isotopic to a closed tubular neighborhood of @xmath123 ( so we preserve unknottedness ) . to see this , note that quinn s homotopy consists of _ finger moves _ to push @xmath132 off of the bad set .",
    "these moves consist of `` pushing the disk with one finger , '' along some arc @xmath109 and back through itself as in figure  4 , creating an extra pair of intersections .",
    "[ fig4 ]    finger moves , which can be thought of as inverses of whitney moves , have been used extensively for cleaning up immersed surfaces since casson s work .",
    "a finger move is determined by the arc @xmath109 with endpoints on the surface , together with a normal vector field to @xmath109 , whose orthogonal complement in @xmath177 carries the circle bundle comprising the tube around our finger .",
    "( automorphisms of the circle bundle do not affect the image set @xmath34 . ) since any two nonzero sections of the 3-plane bundle @xmath177 are homotopic rel boundary if they agree on the boundary , @xmath34 is determined by the arcs @xmath178 specifying the finger moves .",
    "in fact , this collection of arcs is ( in our application ) smoothly isotopic to a standard model .",
    "this is because 1-manifolds can not knot or link in a 4-manifold ( homotopy implies isotopy ) and the corresponding homotopy problem is trivial : once we isotope @xmath178 so that it agrees near its endpoints with the corresponding model arc @xmath179 , the two arcs determine an element of @xmath180 .",
    "however , we can change this element by a generator , by turning @xmath178 once around the normal fiber to @xmath123 at one endpoint of @xmath178 .",

    "next we consider exotic @xmath63 s .",
    "the basic constructions of these are in casson s original paper , although he could not draw the final conclusions with neither freedman nor donaldson theory yet available . the general class of exotic @xmath63 s containing those of theorem  [ r4 ] appeared in @xcite , while the simplest case of these was shown to be exotic in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) and to be stein in @xcite .",
    "these simplest examples are constructed with one 0-handle , two 1-handles , one 2-handle and a casson handle .",
    "the range of diffeomorphism types comes from varying the complexity of the casson handle . to embed such an example as a stein open subset of @xmath54",
    ", we must first embed the honest handles .",
    "while it is easy to embed the 1-skeleton as a stein surface , it takes work to arrange the 2-cell so that the obstructions of theorem  [ real ] can both be explicitly seen to vanish .",
    "( details will appear in @xcite . )",
    "once this is achieved , the casson handle can be located by casson s embedding theorem , and our previous techniques yield the stein surface .",
    "one of the main ingredients of the proof of freedman s theorem  [ freedman ] is his reimbedding theorems .",
    "these elucidate the structure of a casson handle @xmath162 by finding other casson handles with compact closure inside .",
    "ultimately , freedman obtains an uncountable family of casson handles indexed by a standard cantor set @xmath285 $ ] , nested with compact closure inside each other with the ordering inherited from @xmath134 . instead of a casson handle at @xmath286",
    ", freedman shows that the intersection of the remaining casson handles can be taken to be a topological core disk @xmath192 of @xmath162 , and @xmath192 can be assumed smooth except at a single interior point .",
    "the main principle of our section  6 is that in a complex surface , casson handles can be assumed to preserve stein structures , as long as we are allowed to add enough positive kinks .",
    "we conclude that any stein surface @xmath0 made with finitely many handles and casson handles contains a family of stein surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath0 , nested with compact closure , with the order type of @xmath287 .",
    "( for example , any @xmath0 arising from a finite handlebody in theorem  [ g ] or a compact @xmath30 in theorem  [ main ] has this structure . )",
    "the intersection of these nested stein surfaces will be a tame 2-complex , smoothly embedded except at a single point in the interior of each 2-cell , and the 2-cells will be totally real where they are smooth .",
    "in the case of the above exotic @xmath63 , @xcite shows that each diffeomorphism type appears only countably often within the nested family , so there are uncountably many diffeomorphism types of stein exotic @xmath63 s realized this way in @xmath54 , with the cardinality of the continuum in zfc set theory ( proving theorem  [ r4 ] ) .",
    "the argument of @xcite is too specialized to apply to all stein surfaces , but in some cases ( e.g. , any open subset of @xmath54 ) we can distinguish uncountably many diffeomorphism types after we connect by a 1-handle to the family of theorem  [ r4 ] ( proving theorem  [ uncountable ] ) .",
    "other methods sometimes distinguish _ all _ diffeomorphism types in a nested family as above , e.g. , for stein surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath288 or @xmath289 .",
    "our nesting procedure can be combined with genus restrictions , so that the minimal genus of a class @xmath290 increases without bound as the depth in the nesting increases .",
    "alternatively , we can arrange the minimal genus of @xmath276 to be constant , by locating a surface @xmath77 realizing @xmath276 with minimal genus in @xmath0 , observing that for some @xmath7 , @xmath77 lies in the union of the 1-skeleton and @xmath7-stage towers of @xmath0 , then applying reimbedding only to the casson handles attached on top of the @xmath7-stage towers .",
    "note that neighborhood systems of homotopy - equivalent stein surfaces are of interest to complex analysts ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite for neighborhood systems of smoothly embedded surfaces ) , but such neighborhoods are more typically diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "the family of exotic @xmath63 s in @xcite is actually parametrized by @xmath112 , with @xmath291 corresponding to exotic @xmath63 s made with reimbedding technology . to interpolate to a connected family in this way",
    ", one must know that the point - set boundaries of the nested @xmath63 s are homeomorphic to @xmath292 ( concentric round spheres in the topological @xmath63 structure ) .",
    "unfortunately , embedded casson handles typically have point - set boundaries that are not manifolds .",
    "( we can at least arrange that the complements of their closures have the same homotopy groups as the complements of their cores , by sharpening the method of proof of theorem  [ quinn ] , but otherwise the boundaries are ugly . ) to fix this , one replaces casson handles by the infinite towers of capped gropes in @xcite .",
    "this means that between successive stages of immersed disks , one inserts many stages of embedded surfaces .",
    "this cleans up the boundaries , so that the topological @xmath194 can be parametrized with the radial coordinates corresponding to @xmath291 realized by reimbedded towers .",
    "we can apply this technology in the stein setting , since increasing genus has the same effect on @xmath293 as adding positive kinks , but there are more technical details .",
    "( for example , the towers of @xcite are constructed , for convenience , with the same number of positive and negative kinks in each kinky handle , whereas we need an excess of positive kinks . )",
    "the final result is that the families of stein surfaces parametrized by a cantor set lie in continuous 1-parameter families of homeomorphic open sets ( not necessarily stein for parameter values in @xmath294 ) .",
    "our final observation on stein surfaces is that theorem  [ g ] can be deduced from main theorem  [ main ] .",
    "( of course , their proofs rely on similar ideas in any case . ) if @xmath2 is the interior of a handlebody whose indices are all @xmath21 , and @xmath16 is an almost - complex structure on @xmath2 , there is a map @xmath127 from @xmath2 to the rational surface @xmath295 , covered by a complex bundle map of the tangent bundles .",
    "( send the 1-skeleton to a point , and wrap each 2-cell around the generators as necessary to preserve @xmath277 . ) by immersion theory , we can homotope @xmath127 to an immersion , then pull back the complex structure , to create a complex structure on @xmath2 homotopic to @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath29 is the 2-complex obtained from the cores of the handles , applying theorem  [ main ] to @xmath30 gives the required stein surface .",
    "since stein surfaces are in some sense equivalent to weinstein 4-manifolds in the symplectic category , it is natural to ask whether there is an analog of theorem  [ main ] for identifying open subsets of symplectic 4-manifolds that are weinstein .",
    "the main difference is that cores of 2-handles are lagrangian in the weinstein setting  a closed condition that is strictly stronger than the totally real condition for stein 2-handles .",
    "fortunately , there is an @xmath33-principle for immersed lagrangian submanifolds , so we can still obtain immersed disks by killing the invariants of theorem  [ real ] .",
    "it is not presently clear to the author , however , whether these immersions can be created with sufficient control to allow quinn s tower construction to proceed .",
    "the author hopes to return to this question soon .",
