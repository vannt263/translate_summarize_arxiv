    "various effective models using quarks as fundamental dynamical fields , originally designed for the nucleon , have also been successfully used to describe infinite quark matter , and the resulting equations of state ( eos s ) have been applied to investigate the structure of compact stars [ 16 ] . the chromodielectric model ( cdm )  [ 79 ] , for example ,",
    "provides a reasonable phenomenology for the nucleon  @xcite and also allows us to obtain eos s for dense quark matter .",

    "in addition to the structures found by drago et al . , the quartic model predicts another type of compact objects made out of quarks only , smaller and denser than neutron stars .    from the observational point of view",
    ", the recent discovery of x - ray sources , by the hubble and chandra telescopes , increased the plausibility that these sources might be strange quark stars  [ 1719 ] .",
    "in particular , the isolated compact object rx j1856.5 - 3574 with a small radius does not show evidence of spectral lines or edge features  @xcite , reinforcing the conjecture for the existence of stars made out of strange matter .",

    "we note that @xmath17 is not a free parameter since the quartic term of @xmath19 must be positive and the cubic term negative , which implies @xmath29 . in the soliton sector of the model , best nucleon properties",

    "the mean - field energy per unit volume for strange quark matter in the cdm ( plus electrons ) is given by @xmath33 where the first two terms refer to quarks and the third one to the electrons , all described by plane waves .",

    "the matter should satisfy both the electrical charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium .",
    "these conditions should supplement the gap equations , and altogether we have a system of six algebraic equations to solve at each baryon density @xmath45 [ here , @xmath46 stand for each flavor density ] .",

    "i , the @xmath2 field is a slowly increasing function of the density , remaining always smaller than @xmath55  gev .",
    "for such a small @xmath2 , the quartic potential and the quadratic potential are indistinguishable ( see fig .",
    "[ figstar1 ] ) , thus , in practice , solution i corresponds to the one obtained and used by drago et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the quadratic potential . due to the smallness of the @xmath2 field , quark masses are large and the system is in a chiral broken phase .",
    "the solution ii exhibits a large confining field , @xmath56 ( local minimum of @xmath57 ) , independent of the density .",
    "the resulting quark masses are similar for the three flavors and very close to zero ( chiral restored phase ) . therefore , the chemical potentials in solution ii are dominated by the fermi momentum contribution , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e. in solution ii there are almost no electrons .",
    "besides solutions i and ii , there is an additional _ unstable _ solution corresponding to @xmath60 [ local maximum of @xmath61 ) ] .",
    "the energy per baryon number as a function of the baryon density ( eos ) is readily evaluated for each solution .",
    "we stress that eos - i is not sensitive to @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( since @xmath2 is small ) , just depends on @xmath31 .",
    "the saturation density occurs at a relatively low density ( @xmath62 ) and the behavior of eos - i at intermediate densities , is similar to the hadronic eos s ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the two flavors sector ) .",
    "the eos - ii is also insensitive to @xmath17 , but does depend on @xmath18 [ in fact , the dependence is on @xmath63 , as we have already pointed out ] : the energy per baryon number increases with @xmath18 and so does the saturation density . for @xmath64",

    "[ figstar3 ] we present the eos s in the form of pressure @xmath67 versus energy density plots for solutions i and ii and various @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noticing that our results with two distinct eos predicted by the cdm , are consistent with the results from perturbative qcd : it is remarkable indeed that , for @xmath68 the cdm reproduces accurately the eos s recently obtained in a perturbative qcd calculation ( compare our third panel of fig .",
    "[ figstar3 ] with figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    regarding energetics ,",
    "both phases are almost degenerated at high densities and have similar shapes in the @xmath69 plane even at intermediate densities ( or energy densities ) in the narrow range @xmath70 . in that region of @xmath18 , one solution is not clearly lower in energy than the other .",
    "however , we should point out that they correspond to two different @xmath2 values and for the system to undergo a transition from the chiral restored to the chiral broken phase it has to go through a high potential energy barrier . in a 3d plot of the energy per baryon number versus @xmath71",
    "the stable solutions correspond to two distinct  valleys \" , and the unstable solution mentioned at the end of the previous section corresponds to the top of the barrier between the two valleys .",
    "in order to investigate the structure of stars we solved the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation using the two eos .",
    "since eos - i is identical to the one using a quadratic potential , it leads to stars that have the same phenomenology as the hybrid stars obtained by drago et al .",

    ", hadronization occurs and an hadronic equation of state should be used , replacing eos - i .",
    "since eos - ii saturates at a high density and , in addition , the system is not likely to undergo a transition to solution i , one should not perform any connection to the hadronic sector : the eos - ii alone generates a new family of strange quark stars . in fig .",
