    "most of the monte carlo studies of spin models have been done on hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. with the topology of a torus . recently",
    ", however , there has been a growing interest in the effect of other topologies .",
    "some of that interest is motivated by the advance of quantum gravity models , some by problems related to the role of topological excitations of the particular system .",
    "various investigations [ 16 ] have been carried out on lattices topologically equivalent to the surface of a hypersphere in @xmath3 dimensions . on sphere  like surfaces a loop can be continuously contracted to a point : the fundamental homotopy group is trivial .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the dynamics of string  like objects like monopole loops ( in 4d pure gauge theory with @xmath4 gauge symmetry ) or the boundaries of clusters in 2d spin models .",
    "we therefore might expect a different approach to the thermodynamic limit and different finite size corrections to scaling .    at first order phase transitions",
    "the phase mixture obtained in the thermodynamic limit may be influenced by local changes , like fixing one spin , or changing the boundary conditions .",
    "the critical exponents however , should not depend on such effects . at second order phase transitions",
    "one expects that the critical properties are not affected by boundary conditions or by whether one works on lattices with torus or spherical surface geometries if either becomes flat in the infinite volume limit .",
    "such an assumption of universality should be tested in practical examples , which is one of the motivations for this work .",
    "another question is whether the finite size scaling ( fss ) ansatz is general enough to persist .",
    "the important leading terms and the corrections to them may have different size depending on the lattices and their topology as has been observed in the 4d and 2d studies .",
    "the ising model is explicitly solved for torus geometry @xcite even on finite lattices @xcite .",
    "it has a well understood @xmath5 order phase transition .",
    "fss of the bulk quantities is dominated by the leading term and provides a good example of the power of this method to determine critical indices .    here",
    "we want to present a monte carlo study for the ising model on different 2d lattices with the topology of the surface of a sphere : the surface of a 3d cube , a pillow  like structure and the cubic surface projected to a sphere . in all these cases we determine cumulants and partition function zeros on different lattice sizes in order to study the size dependence and fss in detail . after the introduction of these geometries in sect.[sec2 ] , the simulation and multi  histogram analysis are discussed in sect.[sec3 ] and the results in sect.[sec4 ] .",
    "we conclude that there are sizable differences to the usual results on torus  like lattices , but that universality prevails .",
    "preliminary results of this work have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward approach to constructing a sphere  like lattice would be triangulation . we want to stay as close as possible to the original action , however .",
    "this is partly motivated by the related studies @xcite and @xcite , where one wants to keep a 4-link plaquette structure .",
    "also , two of the lattices studied here can be viewed at as combinations of the usual square lattices glued together at the boundaries ; thus in the thermodynamic limit even the non  universal critical coupling ought to agree with that for torus geometry .",
    "the torus is our reference geometry ; in addition three other lattice geometries were used for our simulations ( cf .",
    "[ lattfig ] ) .",
    "torus @xmath6}$ ] : : :    the solution for the ising model on an @xmath7 lattice    with periodic b.c . is known @xcite and we will use this as the    standard to compare our results with .",

    "this lattice    @xmath12[n ] has @xmath13 sites and    @xmath14 links .",
    "( dual ) cube @xmath15}$ ] : : :    this lattice is dual to the surface of a 3d cubic lattice of base    length @xmath10 .",
    "each plaquette of the cubic surface is    identified with a site of @xmath16 .",
    "this has the    advantage , that each site has 4 links to nearest neighbors , like for    the torus .",
    "the lattice has @xmath17 sites and    @xmath18 links .",
    "the curvature is concentrated on the    @xmath19 corner points .",
    "sphere @xmath20}$ ] : : :    that lattice is defined by the sites on the surface of a    @xmath21 cube , projected onto the unit sphere . the site  link    connectivity structure is identical to that of the cube s surface , the    only difference lies in weight factors in the action , to be discussed    below .",
    "the lattice has @xmath22 sites and    @xmath23 links .",
    "the total energy ( or action , if used in the context of quantum field theories ) for the model is given by @xmath24 where the sum runs over all links ( at sites @xmath25 in directions @xmath26 ) .",
    "the spin variables @xmath27 have values @xmath28 .",
    "the weight factors @xmath29 are equal to 1 for the torus and the lattice types @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "the partition function is determined by the sum @xmath30 over all spin configurations @xmath31 .    for lattices @xmath12 and @xmath16 the curvature is concentrated around the corners .",
    "the deficit angle denotes the deviation of the sums of angles of plaquettes ( or triangles ) at a given site from the flat ",
    "space value @xmath32 . for @xmath12",
    "its value is @xmath33 on each of the @xmath34 corners , for @xmath16 it is @xmath35 on each of the @xmath19 corners .",
    "it vanishes on all other sites , as it does on the torus : the lattices are flat almost everywhere . the total curvature on the sphere  like lattices therefore has the value @xmath36 or euler number 2 , as compared to 0 for the torus .",
    "euler s relation for sphere  like lattices is @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 denote the total number of sites , plaquettes and links , respectively ) whereas for torus topology this sum is zero .    both lattice types @xmath12 and @xmath16 can be imagined as built out of flat @xmath7 pieces , glued together along their boundaries .",
    "the deviation from the torus shaped lattice thus disappears at least as fast as a boundary contribution @xmath41 .",
    "the contribution from the corners , where the curvature is concentrated , is suppressed @xmath42 .",
    "we expect that , although not a universal quantity , the value of the critical coupling @xmath43 ( in the thermodynamic limit ) coincides with that for the torus .    in order to mimic a truly spherical lattice more closely , we also took the structure of a cubic surface lattice projected to the sphere as shown in fig .",
    "[ lattfig ] . since the link connectivity structure does not change",
    ", the difference has to be expressed by modifying the weight factors accordingly .",
    "christ et al .",
    "@xcite discuss a possible definition for triangulated ( random ) surfaces , which obeys certain properties , that are necessary for the consistency of the continuum field theory at a second order phase transition .",
    "our lattices are built out of quadrangles and therefore we have to modify that method for the derivation of the weight factors .",
    "we start with the scalar continuum field theory with the euclidean invariant kinetic term @xmath44 ( in fact , we can define the ising model as a discretization of a scalar field theory in the limit of infinite quartic self coupling . )",
    "the discretization on a lattice replaces the derivative term by the nearest neighbor differences , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the distance between the neighboring two points .",
    "the area differential @xmath47 has to be replaced by an area element @xmath48 assigned to each lattice link ( or site term ) .",
    "the discretized kinetic term then leads to the link term of the lattice action ( [ actiondef ] ) , with the weight factor @xmath49 .",
    "the total lattice volume has to be split into lattice area elements attributed to the link contributions .",
    "these lattice area elements are constructed with help of the dual lattice , where each site may be defined as the barycenter of the plaquettes of the original lattice ( cf . fig .",
    "[ dualweightelement ] ) .",
    "links of the dual lattice are drawn between sites corresponding to neighboring plaquettes .",
    "each link on the original lattice corresponds exactly to one link of the dual lattice .    for simplicity",
    "we make two approximations :    * we assume that all quadrangles are flat ; in reality the four corners are not co  planar . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the lattice becomes locally flat and the error vanishes .",
    "* we neglect angular distortions and approximate each quadrangle by a rectangle ; this allows us to write the area assigned to a lattice link @xmath25 as the product of the lengths of the dual link with that of the link itself , @xmath50 .",
    "the error introduced due to this approximation does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit and introduces slight distortions from the regular spherical surface .",
    "however , the curvature is still smeared out over the whole lattice , although somewhat non  uniformly .",
    "as will turn out later , that appears to be no serious problem for the finite size analysis .    this way",
    "the total lattice volume is distributed over all links .    with these approximations",
    "we find that the weight factors for the lattice geometry @xmath51 $ ] are just the ratio of dual link length to the link length @xmath52 equivalent to the factor suggested in @xcite for triangulations .    for this particular sphere  like lattice we do not expect , that the thermodynamic limit value of the critical coupling is identical to that of the torus . since we have introduced a change of the action affecting all links , @xmath43 will be renormalized",
    ". still we expect universal behavior of the critical exponents , to be checked numerically .",
    "the computer programs use index tables to deal with the lattice geometry . for the lattices",
    "@xmath51 $ ] the weight factors are precalculated and tabulated . in our discussions we will refer to the lattice volume @xmath53 as the typical size quantity . for lattices",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 this is just the number of links .",
    "a length scale may be defined as @xmath55 , such that its value is @xmath10 for a torus @xmath56 $ ] .    in another study of the ising model",
    "@xcite regular honeycomb lattices folded to tetrahedron shapes have been used .",
    "there it was possible to obtain series expansions as well as monte carlo results . in @xcite",
    "the ising model was studied with monte carlo methods on triangulated random lattices with sphere  like topology .",
    "we compare these results with ours in the section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in the monte carlo simulation we studied lattices with the base length @xmath57 16 , 32 , 64 and 128 .",
    "( the torus results were determined up to @xmath58 . )",
    "the lattices have the volumes given in table [ voltable ] .",
    ".the volumes @xmath59 as defined in the text ; the equivalent linear extent @xmath60 ranges from 16 ( for the torus ) up to 313 ( for the sphere ) . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected from looking at the data we find only a small contribution to the term @xmath61 , compatible with zero for all observable except for @xmath62 . removing this term altogether seems conceivable , although @xmath63 is quadrupled in this case .",
    "the second term clearly dominates .",
    "however , the resulting value @xmath64 , although consistent with the results for the tetrahedron @xcite , is not stringent .",
    "in fact , allowing for the second ansatz ( [ betacfitsb ] ) give almost the same fit quality and would be _ indistinguishable in the figure_. also fixing @xmath65 to a value @xmath66 is still compatible with the data .",
    "we conclude that we are in a situation where a possible leading fss term @xmath61 has an ( almost or completely ) vanishing coefficient and the subleading terms dominate .",
    "this resembles the ising model on a cylinder with infinite extension in one direction .",
    "it can not be decided , whether the corresponding term is of form ( [ betacfitsa ] ) or ( [ betacfitsb ] ) .",
    "now we turn to the approximate spherical surface topology ( @xmath67 ) . whereas for the pillow and cubic surface lattices the curvature is concentrated in 8 or 24 points here it is more or less uniformly distributed among all sites of the lattice .",
    "the total curvature ( the euler number ) remains constant .    in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] the peak positions of the specific heat and the other cumulants are plotted together with fitted curves according to ( [ betacfitsa ] ) . here",
    "@xmath43 is a free parameter , otherwise we follow the procedure discussed above , i.e. one common value of @xmath65 but different parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 depending on the observable . since we have fewer data we include the data from the smaller lattices with @xmath70",
    "this is also justified by the overall smaller deviations from the asymptotic value .",
    "the resulting values are also given in table [ fitpars ] .",
    "we find a behavior in agreement with the other sphere  like lattices .",
    "the contribution of the term @xmath61 is again very small and the non  linear term dominates again .",
    "the overall variation of the pseudocritical points with @xmath71 is for most observables smaller than for the other lattice geometries .",
    "the fitted critical temperature is @xmath72 with a @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is consistent .",
    "again the fit to ( [ betacfitsb ] ) gives results of comparable quality and corresponding curves would be indistinguishable in the figure .",
    "we have performed a high statistics monte carlo study of the ising model on lattices of various size and different shapes , all with sphere  like topology .",
    "our fss analysis led to the following conclusions .",
    "* we have found explicitly , that the ising model on a spherical surface topology lies in the same universality class as the planar ising model with periodic boundary conditions  topologically the surface of a torus .",
    "our results demonstrate that universality holds , independent of the lattice geometry .",
    "this agrees with similar conclusions obtained for tetrahedral lattices @xcite and random lattices @xcite of sphere  like topology .",
    "* however , some observables are not well suited to find the expected leading fss behavior .",
    "different observables vary in their sensitivity . of the studied quantities ( in the even sector of the ising model )",
    "we find that the imaginary part of the fisher zero closest to the real axis has the smallest ( in fact : not identifiable within our accuracy ) deviations from the leading fss behavior .",
    "related to this quantity , also the peak value of the specific heat scales according to the fss formulas with the onsager values for the critical exponents without further ( identifiable ) corrections .",
    "the values of the other cumulant have larger statistical errors but are also in agreement with the torus results . *",
    "the change in the topology class influences the size of the fss contributions .",
    "this appears to affect in particular the pseudocritical points .",
    "we find no significant contribution of @xmath61 , which is the dominant fss term for the torus pseudocritical points ( with a shift exponent @xmath76 ) .",
    "instead we find that the fss behavior is dominated by a term @xmath77 with a mean value @xmath78 ( averaging the results for @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "a compatible value was obtained in an independent study for tetrahedral lattices @xcite .",
    "the behavior seems to be universal for all sphere  like lattices , independent of the details of the geometry .",
    "this contribution is also consistent with a term @xmath79 ; such a term describes the fss of the specific heat peak position for the ising model in cylinder geometry @xcite .",
    "it also has been argued , that a term of that kind contributes to the free energy per unit volume for systems with non ",
    "zero euler number @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this implies that none of these observables is qualified to derive the critical exponent @xmath80 . *",
    "in general we find that the studied sphere ",
    "like lattices have smaller corrections to the infinite volume behavior than one observes for the torus ( i.e. periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the approach to the thermodynamic shapes is faster and in a more symmetric way . *",
    "our analysis of the fisher zeros of the partition function is consistent with this picture . with increasing size the closest zero approaches the real axis almost perpendicular .",
    "( note , that this behavior is a finite size behavior and is not identical to the asymptotic impact angle  defined e.g. as the angle between the first and second zero ) .",
    "the results for the spherical surface geometry appear to be closest to the thermodynamic behavior in general . for different lattice ( sphere  like )",
    "geometries the fss behavior is consistent if one chooses the size variable @xmath81 , where @xmath59 is the number of links .",
    "this choice appears to be preferable over the base length @xmath10 .    in general our conclusion",
    "are consistent with other results on sphere  like lattices for the ising model @xcite and with similar observations in other models @xcite , also in higher dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "how can one explain the more symmetric and seemingly faster approach to the thermodynamic limit , that occurs for the sphere  like lattices as compared to the torus ?",
    "one may argue , that on the 2d torus there are two globally distinguished directions .",
    "as soon as the correlation length @xmath82 approaches some fraction of the linear size , the system notices the loss of its rotational invariance .",
    "larger clusters may then span in the two distinguished directions of the lattice . on sphere  like surfaces",
    "( although there is local orientation ) there are no globally distinguished directions .",
    "rotational invariance holds to a larger extent and the behavior of the finite system is more symmetric around the critical point .                                            m.  e. fisher , in _ critical phenomena , proc .",
