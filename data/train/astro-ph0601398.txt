    "during the past two decades , the number of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) known to exhibit broad , double - peaked balmer emission lines has been steadily increasing .",
    "these lines were first observed in the broad - line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) arp  102b @xcite , 3c  390.3 @xcite , and 3c  332 @xcite and are reminiscent of the double - peaked emission lines observed in cataclysmic variables , where they are regarded as the kinematic signature of the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus it was suggested by the above authors that the double - peaked emission lines originate in the accretion disk that fuels the agn .",
    "a systematic survey of @xmath9 blrgs and radio - loud quasars was undertaken later on and it was found that @xmath10  20% of the observed objects exhibited double - peaked balmer lines @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that 3% of the @xmath11 agns in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are double - peaked emitters .",
    "double - peaked emission lines have also been observed in low ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including ngc  1097 @xcite , m81 @xcite , ngc  4203 @xcite , ngc  4450 @xcite , and ngc  4579 @xcite . given the difficulty of detecting broad emission lines in liners @xcite it is likely that a larger number of liners exhibit double - peaked emission lines .",
    "although the known double - peaked emitters represent a small fraction of the total agn population , they are an important and intriguing class of objects that deserve further study .    as described in detail by @xcite , observational tests and basic physical considerations",
    "strongly suggest that the double - peaked balmer lines originate in the outer regions of the accretion disk at distances from the black hole of hundreds to thousands of gravitational radii ( @xmath12  =  @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the black hole ) .",
    "the _ profiles _ of the double - peaked emission lines are observed to vary on time scales of years to decades and show occasional reversals in the relative strength of the red and blue peaks ( for examples , see * ? ? ?",

    "intensive monitoring of 3c  390.3 shows that the time lag between variations in the continuum and the optical broad line is @xmath10 20 days @xcite thus the profile variations occur on much longer time scales than the light - crossing time and seem to be unrelated to fluctuations in the ionizing continuum flux that take place on time scales of a few days to a few weeks",
    ". a similar effect is also observed in systematically monitored seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the profile variability is likely to be a manifestation of _ physical _ changes in the outer disk and the profile variability is thus a powerful tool that can be used to test models for dynamical behavior in accretion disks .",
    "therefore , in the early 1990s a campaign was undertaken to systematically monitor a set of @xmath15 double - peaked emitters , including blrgs from the @xcite sample and several liners .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the profiles of approximately 60% and 40% , respectively , of the double - peaked emitters from their samples can be fitted by a simple , axisymmetric accretion disk model .",
    "however the long - term profile variability and the fact that in some objects the red peak is stronger than the blue peak ( in contrast to the expectations of relativistic doppler boosting ) require the use of more general , non - axisymmetric models .",
    "some of the models that have been successfully employed to fit observed profiles include circular disks with orbiting bright spots ( arp  102b and 3c  390.3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or spiral emissivity perturbations ( 3c  390.3 , 3c  332 , and ngc  1097 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and precessing elliptical disks ( ngc  1097 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to successfully interpret and model the long - term profile variability , it is not sufficient to reproduce the observed sequence of profiles ; the variability must occur on a physical time scale that is consistent with the chosen model .",
    "the time scales of interest are the light crossing , dynamical , thermal , and sound crossing times , which are set by the black hole mass ( @xmath14 ) and are given by @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19k , and @xmath20 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xcite .",
    "the above models all predict variability on different time scales .",
    "for example matter embedded in the disk orbits over @xmath21 , thermal instabilities will dissipate over @xmath22 , density perturbations , such as a spiral wave , precess on time scales that are an order of magnitude longer than @xmath21 up to @xmath23 , and an elliptical disk will precess over even longer time scales .",
    "many of the models described above yield strikingly similar sequences of profiles . in order to determine which physical mechanism is responsible for the profile variability ,",
    "it is necessary to connect the observed variability time scale ( in years ) with one of the above _ physical _ time scales . using an estimate of the black hole mass in ngc  1097 , @xcite estimated the physical time scales in the outer accretion disk which favored a spiral arm model over an elliptical disk model for this object .",
    "however , in order to discriminate between the above time scales , the black hole mass must be known to better than an order of magnitude and preferably to better than a factor of three .",
    "another motivation for accurately estimating the black hole masses in the double - peaked emitters is to determine the accretion rate , relative to the eddington accretion rate ( @xmath24 ) , which is a diagnostic of the structure of the inner accretion flow . because the local energy dissipation in the accretion disk is not always sufficient to power the observed h@xmath25 luminosity , @xcite proposed that the inner accretion flow in double - peaked emitters has the form of an ion torus @xcite , or similar vertically extended , radiatively inefficient flow",
    ". this vertically extended structure would be able to illuminate the outer accretion disk and power the observed emission lines .",
    "for the well - studied @xcite sample there is considerable indirect observational support of this hypothesis , discussed fully in @xcite , which is underscored by the growing number of liners known to sport double - peaked emission lines .",
    "the assumption that the inner accretion flow is radiatively inefficient is fundamental to the current ideas for the formation of the double - peaked emission lines and also the relationship between double - peaked emitters and the agn population in general .",
    "thus it is extremely important to test this hypothesis more directly by obtaining estimates of the black hole masses , and thus @xmath24 , for double - peaked emitters .",
    "most of the double - peaked emitters are too distant to obtain black hole masses directly via spatially resolved stellar and gas kinematics .",
    "however , it is possible to determine the black hole masses indirectly through the well - known correlation between @xmath14 and the _ stellar _ velocity dispersion ( @xmath26 ) measured on the scale of the effective radius of the bulge @xcite .",
    "therefore we have begun a program to measure the stellar velocity dispersions in double - peaked emitters using the caii  @xmath27 triplet and present here the results for five objects . after obtaining estimates of the black hole masses via the @xmath14@xmath26  relationship",
    ", the physical time scales in the outer accretion disk and @xmath24 can be inferred for each object .    here , we focus specifically on measurements of the velocity dispersion in these double - peaked emitters to enable determinations of black hole masses .",
    "although the time scales derived here are extremely valuable in modeling the long - term profile variability in these objects , a detailed discussion of the profile modeling is deferred to forthcoming papers .",
    "preliminary results on modeling the profile variability ( with the help of the black hole masses obtained here ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ mass_data ]",
    ", we describe the target selection , observations and data reductions .",
    "the analysis of the data , including an examination of the various sources of error , are described in  [ mass_analysis ] and",
    "the results and their implications are presented and discussed in ",
    "[ mass_discussion ] . in appendix",
    "[ mass_ap1 ] , we present a detailed description of the procedure used to correct the telluric water vapor absorptions lines in these spectra . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a wmap cosmology ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; * ? ? ?",
    "our primary motivation for obtaining robust black hole masses is to assist with modeling and interpreting the long - term profile variability of the double - peaked emitters .",
    "therefore , we selected the targets that were part of the long - term monitoring campaign and have shown interesting variability .",
    "absorption due to telluric water vapor becomes severe at wavelengths longer than 9200  @xmath31 , so only objects with @xmath32 were selected .",
    "finally , we only selected objects with declinations less than @xmath33 .",
    "five objects , ngc  1097 , pictor  a , pks  0921213 , 1e  0450.31817 , and iras  0236.63101 , met these criteria , and the properties of these objects are given in table [ gal_obs ] .",
    "all of our targets are hosted by elliptical galaxies or early - type spirals , whose stellar spectra in the caii  region are dominated by g and k giants @xcite .",
    "therefore we observed numerous g and k giant stars , with spectral types ranging from k5 to g6 , to serve as stellar templates .",
    "the stars used in the final fits are listed in table [ star_obs ] .",
    "the spectra were obtained on 2003 december 48 using the rc spectrograph on the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro - tololo ineteramerican observatory .",
    "the g  380 grating was used in conjunction with the rg 610 order - separating filter and the spectra covered the range from 7690 to 9350  @xmath31 .",
    "the slit had a width of @xmath3433 and was oriented east to west .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution was 1.35  @xmath31 fwhm , as measured from the arc lamp spectra , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "the galaxies and the template stars were observed at an airmass of less than 1.13 and differential atmospheric refraction was not significant over the small wavelength interval of interest.the atmospheric seeing during the observations of the galaxies was less than @xmath36 and frequently less than @xmath37 , although some of the template stars were observed with seeing as large as @xmath38 .",
    "a set of bias frames and henear comparison lamp spectra were taken at the beginning and end of each night and quartz flats were taken immediately preceding or following each galaxy exposure . rapidly rotating b stars",
    "( with rotational velocities in excess of 200  @xmath1 ) were observed periodically throughout the night at similar airmass as the galaxies and template stars and were used to correct for the deep telluric water vapor lines at wavelengths longer than 8900  @xmath31 ( in the galaxies ) and shorter than 8400  @xmath31 ( in the template stars ) .",
    "the exposure times for the galaxies are listed in table [ gal_obs ] .    the primary data reductions  the bias level correction , flat fielding , sky subtraction , removal of bad columns and cosmic rays , extraction of the spectra , and wavelength calibration",
    " were performed using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the night sky emission was estimated by fitting a 3rd order spline along the spatial direction to two intervals ( with widths of 1020 pixels ) located on either side of the spectral extraction region . in most objects , with the exception of pictor  a , the ca ii region was not heavily contaminated by night sky emission lines .",
    "the issue of sky subtraction will be discussed further in  [ fit_method ] .",
    "the difference in dispersion solutions from one night to the next was less than 0.1% , so the same dispersion solution was applied to the spectra from all five nights .",
    "it was not possible to obtain comparison lamp spectra before or after each galaxy spectrum was taken .",
    "however , measurements of the night sky lines , which are largely unblended at this resolution , were used to fine - tune the wavelength solution for the galaxy spectra before they were combined ; this ensured that the combined spectra were not artificially broadened .",
    "the applied shifts were generally less than 1@xmath39 .",
    "the error spectrum was calculated by adding in quadrature the poisson noise in the spectra of the night sky and the object spectrum ( prior to the removal of cosmic rays and bad columns ) .",
    "none of the host galaxies in our sample have a reported value of the effective radius , and in all cases except ngc  1097 and pictor  a , suitable images were not available from which to determine the effective radius . to obtain a rough estimate of the effective radius ,",
    "the spectra were collapsed along the spectral direction to obtain a spatial profile , which was then fitted with the sum of a de vaucouleurs ( r@xmath40 ) profile and an agn point source convolved with a gaussian , and background .",
    "the effective radius determined for pictor  a from a ground - based image was in agreement with that obtained from the spatial profile .",
    "there was considerable uncertainty in the effective radii , however , and we chose to extract the spectra using the smallest effective radius allowed by the data ( see also the discussion in  [ mass_error_source ] ) . in the case of ngc  1097 , which is a spiral galaxy with a nuclear star forming ring ,",
    "the extraction radius was chosen to lie just within the star forming ring ( see  [ mass_notes ] for more details ) .",
    "the extraction radii used for the galaxies are listed in table [ gal_obs ] .",
    "the removal of the telluric water vapor lines at wavelengths longer than 8900  @xmath31 was an essential step in the data reductions , because many of the caii  lines in the observed galaxies were redshifted into this region of the spectrum .",
    "as described in detail in appendix  a , a telluric template of the atmospheric transmission was derived from the spectrum of a rapidly rotating b - star .",
    "the spectra obtained from individual exposures of the galaxies were divided by this telluric template allowing for the possibility of a slight wavelength shift between the template and galaxy spectra . because the humidity was quite low and stable throughout the run ( 2535% ) and",
    "all of our objects were observed at low airmass , we found that it was possible to correct all of the galaxies with the same telluric template .",
    "the spectra of the g and k giant stars as well as those from individual exposures of the galaxies were normalized with a low order polynomial .",
    "in most instances , the averaged galaxy spectra could be successfully fitted without any further normalization .",
    "however , the spectrum of ngc  1097 was re - normalized with a low - order polynomial in the region of the caii  triplet .",
    "the resulting galaxy spectra and a representative template star are show in figure  [ spectra ] . the average signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the galaxy spectra are listed in table  [ gal_obs ] ; the s / n of the stellar templates ranged from 150 to 300 .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the host galaxies of these five agns were determined by directly fitting the galaxy spectra with a model given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a stellar template , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 1 ) is a dilution factor , @xmath45 is a gaussian with a dispersion @xmath26 , @xmath46 is a low - order ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 order ) polynomial , and @xmath49 denotes a convolution .",
    "the stellar template was either an individual g or k giant star or a linear combination of g and k giants ( with weights of 25% and 75% respectively ; following , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fitting intervals were selected to exclude emission lines (  @xmath508446 and [ ]  @xmath508618 ) however it was not necessary to explicitly exclude pixels contaminated by strong night sky emission lines , bad columns , or cosmic rays ; the large error bars on such data points resulted in these data being effectively ignored in determining the best fitting model .    to find the best fitting velocity dispersion and its uncertainty we scanned the 2-dimensional parameter space defined by @xmath26 and @xmath43 in small steps .",
    "the coefficients of the low - order polynomial describing the non - stellar continuum were evaluated at each grid point by minimizing the @xmath51 statistic .",
    "for all of the galaxies , including ngc  1097 , the value of @xmath52 per degree of freedom ( @xmath53 ) for the best fit was typically @xmath54 .",
    "this large value of @xmath53 suggests that the error bars on the flux density of the pixels in the spectra were underestimated and in fact the root mean square ( rms ) dispersion of the data in featureless regions of the spectra was typically 1.51.9 times larger than the formal error bars assigned to the individual pixels .",
    "we attribute this increased scatter to imperfect subtraction of the strong night - sky emission lines appearing throughout our spectral range ( this was caused by curvature of the sky lines along the direction of the slit ) .",
    "we note that the discrepancy between the rms deviation and the formal error bars is only slightly greater at wavelengths larger than 8900  @xmath31 , where the telluric absorption correction was performed .",
    "if we increased the error bars on the spectral pixels by the above factor , the best fit models would have had @xmath55 in most cases .",
    "thus the values of @xmath52 for each fit were rescaled such that @xmath56 and the 68%-confidence error contour in @xmath26 and @xmath43 was defined by @xmath57 .",
    "this is equivalent to the practice of rescaling the error bars on each pixel , adopted by @xcite .",
    "the galaxy spectra and their best fitting models are shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the use of a direct fitting method for determining velocity dispersions has been well tested by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that the results obtained with direct fitting are consistent with those obtained through the fourier correlation quotient method ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we also conducted our own tests using simulated spectra that were generated from a broadened k2 iii stellar template ( plus a featureless continuum ) to which random noise was added . in our simulated spectra ,",
    "the velocity dispersion ranged from 100 to 200@xmath58 , the dilution factor ( @xmath43 ) varied from 0.6 to 1.0 , the order of the featureless continuum ranged from 0 to 2 , and the s / n of the spectra ranged from 35 to 100 .",
    "after generating ten realizations of each simulated spectrum , we found that our direct fitting method successfully recovered the input velocity dispersion within the 68% error interval determined from the fit .",
    "this was the case even when the order of the polynomial representing the featureless continuum was forced to be different from that used to generate the spectra .",
    "of course , the error bar on the best - fit stellar velocity dispersion was larger for spectra with lower s / n and/or larger velocity dispersion and dilution factor .",
    "we also tested our implementation of the direct fitting method , which differs slightly from that used by @xcite , by using our code to fit the data for arp  102b obtained by these authors . within the error bars ,",
    "we obtain the same velocity dispersion as these authors .",
    "there are some potential sources of systematic error which were not accounted for by the error analysis described above .",
    "_ extraction size .",
    " _ the effective radii of the galaxies determined here are quite uncertain , however we found that best - fit velocity dispersion was not sensitive to the extraction radius .",
    "we also note that the s / n of the spectra was not significantly affected by the extraction radius , with the exception of pictor  a which is discussed further in  [ mass_notes ] .",
    "_ telluric absorption correction .",
    " _ although considerable care was taken to perform the telluric absorption correction , the telluric template is most likely overestimated in the interval from 9195 to 9215@xmath31 , as described in detail in appendix [ mass_ap1 ] .",
    "consequently , the telluric correction in this interval is not complete and the flux in the corrected galaxy spectra could be underestimated by as much as 4% .",
    "this artifact can not be accounted for in any statistical way , however when it is obvious in the spectra , this interval is not included in the fit .",
    "_ template mismatch .",
    " _ an important advantage of using the caii  triplet to measure the stellar velocity dispersion is the fact that the strength of the absorption lines is relatively insensitive to the stellar population @xcite .",
    "we found that the rms scatter in the values of @xmath26 obtained using the different templates ( both individual stars and linear combinations of stars ) was only a few  @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the rms spread we obtain when fitting high s / n simulated spectra with stellar templates that were different than that used to generate the spectrum .",
    "this template mismatch represents an additional error which is not accounted for by our fitting procedure , which only explores a range in @xmath26 and @xmath43 . we treat this rms spread as an additional error which we add in quadrature to the 68% error bar for ngc  1097 , similarly to @xcite . for the other galaxies the uncertainty due to template mismatch was negligible compared to the uncertainty on the best - fit and",
    "was not included .",
    "_ ngc 1097 .  _ the nuclear structure of the barred spiral galaxy ngc  1097 is extremely complicated , as evidenced by @xmath59co observations which suggest the presence of a cold nuclear disk being fed by matter streaming along the bar @xcite .",

    "was excluded from the fit because contamination from [ fe ii ] emission might be responsible for the poor fit to the data in this interval .",

    "the seds were integrated from 1  mhz to 100  kev , using power - law interpolations between data points .",
    "we note that the 210  kev flux of an agn is variable by a factor of a few , which implies an additional uncertainty to the bolometric luminosities estimated from the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the eddington ratios listed in table  [ results_tab ] span a wide range and there is a general positive trend between bolometric luminosity and eddington ratio , which we illustrate in figure  [ lbol_eddrat ] .",
    "however , we do not consider this trend convincing because the quantities plotted are not independent of each other ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the trend is merely a consequence of the fact that the estimated black hole masses span only a factor of 10 ( a factor of 2 , if 3c  390.3 is excluded ) , while the bolometirc luminosities span a factor of @xmath87 .",
    "the existence of such a trend is also called into question by the fact that 3c  390.3 has @xmath85 that is two orders of magnitude larger than iras  0236.63101 and 1e  0450.41817 , yet its eddington ratio is similar .",
    "while many double - peaked emitters may harbor radiatively inefficient accretion flows , the accretion flow in some objects , such as pictor  a and pks  0921213 , are probably more similar to those found in seyfert 1s .",
    "a vertically extended structure may still be required in these objects to illuminate the outer accretion disk and may take the form of a spherical corona such as that used by @xcite , a beamed corona @xcite , and/or the base of the jet @xcite .    that the double - peaked emitters in even this small sample has a wide range eddington ratios is not completely surprising .",
    "the double - peaked emitters found in the sdss by @xcite are very heterogeneous .",
    "although 12% were classified as liners , many others had properties which were indistinguishable from the general @xmath11 agn population .",
    "we note that our results confirm the _ general _ findings of @xcite , who estimated black hole masses for both the @xcite and @xcite samples through a series of correlations obtained from reverberation mapping of agns @xcite .",
    "these authors found that ( 1 ) double - peaked emitters are a heterogeneous group with a wide range in eddington ratios and ( 2 ) those objects with higher bolometric luminosities tend to have larger eddington ratios .",
    "however , the black hole masses of individual double - peaked emitters deduced through that method can be very inaccurate , as acknowledged by these authors .",
    "although the black hole masses for 1e  0450.31817 and arp  102b inferred by these authors are consistent with those obtained through the @xmath14@xmath26  relationship , the black hole masses for pictor  a and iras  0236.63101 were overestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "thus we caution that for the purposes of modeling and interpreting individual objects , it is necessary to obtain black hole masses through a method which is more well tested and well calibrated in the range of bh masses relevant to our objects , such as the @xmath14@xmath26  relationship .",

    "we thank a. barth for allowing us to use his spectra to test our fitting method .",
    "removal of the telluric water vapor absorption lines was an essential component of the data reductions because , with the exception of ngc  1097 , at least one of the caii  absorption lines in each target galaxy was embedded in the telluric water vapor lines at wavelengths longer than 8900   . to illustrate this we show in figure  [ iras_fig ] the uncorrected spectrum of iras  0236.63101 in which all three caii  lines are embedded in the telluric water vapor bands . to create a template of the atmospheric transmission , it is common to observe an object with a nearly featureless continuum in which any sharp features can be attributed to atmospheric absorption .",
    "the atmospheric transmission changes not only with position in the sky and airmass , but also throughout the night . because we wished to observe telluric standards several times each night",
    ", we opted to observe rapidly rotating b - stars , with rotational velocities in excess of 200  @xmath1 .",
    "although these stars are not as featureless as white dwarfs , they have the advantage of being more common , allowing us to find a telluric standard in a similar region of the sky as our targets .",
    "more importantly , they are very bright , requiring only @xmath88  s of exposure .    despite the rotational broadening ,",
    "the hydrogen paschen lines were still narrow enough that they could not be fitted as part of the continuum as shown in figure  [ bstar ] .",
    "we modeled the intrinsic spectrum of the b - star as a combination of a low - order ( @xmath89 ) polynomial and a set of paschen absorption lines represented with voigt profiles .",
    "the best - fit voigt profile parameters were determined by fitting the interval from 8650 to 8875   , a portion of the b - star spectrum which had only three relatively un - blended paschen lines and was free from telluric absorption lines . restricting the profile parameters ( except for their strengths ) to narrow ranges around the best - fit values , the b - star spectrum",
    "was then fitted over the 87259300    interval , which included four paschen lines , two of which were fitted in the previous step .",
    "a sequence of rejection iterations was performed , in which the lower rejection level became progressively more strict so as to force the fit to model the upper envelope of the spectrum .",
    "an example of this fit is shown in figure  [ bstar ] .",
    "the b - star spectrum was then divided by this model fit to generate a template of the telluric absorption lines and this telluric template was set to unity at wavelengths less than 8900   .",
    "the residual template still exceeded unity near the red end of the spectrum , particularly in the interval from 9195 to 9215@xmath31 , located on the blue wing of the 9229.75@xmath31 pa@xmath90 line .",
    "the depth of this paschen line was underestimated , because there was not sufficient spectral coverage redward of the line to determine the true continuum level ( see fig .",
    "[ bstar ] ) . a first - order polynomial was fitted _",
    "post facto _ to the envelope of the template to ensure that all values were less than unity .",
    "nevertheless , we suspect that the telluric template is overestimated by as much as 4% in the interval from 9195 - 9215@xmath31 and we exercise caution when using the template over this range of wavelengths .",
    "the only object affected by this defect is iras  0236.63101 , where the caii  @xmath508662 line appears to be too deep ; the impact of this is discussed in  [ mass_notes ] . if one plans to use telluric templates derived from rapidly rotating b - stars near 9200@xmath31 , it is adviseable to have sufficient spectral coverage red - ward of the pa@xmath90 line so that the continuum level ( and thus the true line depth ) can be determined .    of the six rapidly rotating b -",
    "stars observed , the simple voigt profile model described above only yielded a satisfactory fit ( i.e. residuals less than 1% ) in hd  34863 .",
    "however , the humidity was fortunately low and extremely stable over the course of the observing run . when the template derived from hd 34863",
    "was applied to the other rapidly rotating b - stars , the residuals were less than 3% in all cases and sometimes less than 1% , thus we were able to apply this single template to all the galaxy spectra with little additional degradation in the s / n .",
    "the telluric absorption lines are not resolved in these data and it is possible that the lines are so severely blended that they form a pseudo - continuum that would not be corrected for by our method .",
    "however , we have verified that this is not the case .",
    "a spectrum of the telluric water vapor lines derived from a high resolution ( @xmath91 ) near - ir spectrum of arcturus @xcite was convolved by a gaussian with a dispersion of 1.35  @xmath31 .",
    "there was no pseudo - continuum associated with the convolved spectrum and there was excellent agreement between the overall shape of the convolved telluric template and the telluric template used in this paper .",
    "the spectrum of hd 34863 was also used to derive a telluric template to correct the spectra of the g and k giant stars from 8160 to 8400   . in this region",
    ", the b - star spectrum is featureless , and deriving the template was straight forward .",
    "this template was applied to the stars using the same method as for the galaxies .                                                              ,",
