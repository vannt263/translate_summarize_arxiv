    "the central idea of algebraic quantum field theory is the representation of observables by a net of local @xmath0-algebras associated to bounded regions of a spacetime ( see ( haag , 1992 ) ) .",
    "this correspondence is established _ via _ the standard axioms of the theory such as isotony , locality ( also called einstein causality or microcausality ) and covariance .",
    "a state @xmath1 in such a local quantum theory is defined as a normalized positive linear functional on the quasilocal observable algebra @xmath2 which is an inductive limit of local observable algebras .",
    "the representation @xmath3 corresponding to the state @xmath1 converts the net of @xmath0-algebras into a net of von neumann observable algebras by closures in the weak topology .",
    "since von neumann algebras are rich in projections , they offer a nice representation of _ quantum events _ : projections can be interpreted as 0 - 1valued observables and their expectation value defines the probability of the event that the observable takes on the value 1 in the appropriate quantum state .",
    "although due to the axiom of locality two projections @xmath4 and @xmath5 commute if they are contained in local algebras supported in spacelike separated regions , they can still _ be correlating _ in a state @xmath1 , that is @xmath6 in general .",
    "due to their spacelike separated supports the correlation between these events is said to be _",
    "superluminal_. since spacelike separation excludes direct causal influence , one may look for a causal explanation of these superluminal correlations in terms of _ common causes_.    the first probabilistic definition of the common cause is due to hans reichenbach ( 1956 ) .",
    "reichenbach s definition has been first generalized to algebraic quantum field theory by rdei ( 1997 , 1998 ) and the question was posed whether superluminal correlations can be given a common causal explanation . as a positive answer , rdei and summers ( 2002 , 2007 )",
    "have shown that in the von neumann algebraic setting with type iii local algebras there always exists a common cause commuting with the correlating projections in the union of their causal past called the _ weak past_. hofer - szab and vecsernys ( 2012a ) have shown , however , that this is not a general fact in _ all _ local quantum theories : there exist correlations in algebraic quantum field theory with locally _",
    "finite _ degrees of freedom for which no commutative common causal explanation can be given . finally , hofer - szab and vecsernys ( 2012b ) have shown that by allowing common causes that do _ not _ commute with the correlating events the noncommutative version of the result of rdei and summers can be regained . in the same paper",
    "it also was argued why demanding commutativity between the common causes and the correlating events is unjustified and should be given up .",
    "this paper is a further step into the investigation of noncommuting common causes : we will apply them for the common causal explanation of not _",
    "one _ but _ several _ superluminal correlations together violating the clauser ",
    "horne inequality . to be more specific ,",
    "consider four events @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are von neumann algebras supported in the spacelike separated regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "suppose that the four pairs @xmath18 are correlating in a state @xmath1 that is @xmath19 suppose furthermore that they violate the clauser ",
    "horne ( ch ) inequality ( clauser and horne , 1974 ) defined as follows : @xmath20    sometimes in the epr - bell literature another bell - type inequality is used instead of ( [ ch_int ] ) : the clauser  horne  shimony ",
    "holte ( chsh ) inequality ( clauser , horne , shimony and holt , 1969 ) defined in the following way : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are self - adjoint _ contractions _ ( that is @xmath24 for @xmath13 ) located in @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show , however , that in a given state @xmath1 the set @xmath25 violates the ch inequality ( [ ch_int ] ) _ if and only if _ the set @xmath26 of self - adjoint contractions given by @xmath27 violates the chsh inequality ( [ chsh_int ] ) .",
    "therefore we will concentrate only on the ch - type bell inequalities .",
    "a number of important results in ( summers , werner 1988 ) , ( halvorson , clifton 2000 ) prove that poincar covariant algebraic field theories abound in normal states establishing superluminal correlations between spacelike separated projections / contractions violating the ch / chsh inequality .",
    "here we produce such states in algebraic field theories with locally finite degrees of freedom , namely in local uhf - type quantum theories ( hofer - szab and vecsernys , 2012b ) . in this case the events @xmath28 and @xmath29 will be elements of such commuting local algebras @xmath14 and @xmath15 with spacelike separated supports @xmath16 and @xmath17 that are isomorphic to simple matrix algebras @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , they generate a tensor product algebra : @xmath32 .",
    "thus the meaning of the mentioned inequalities can be enlightened in terms of quantum information theory ( see for example ( horodeczki et al . , 2009 ) ) : the existence of a correlation ( [ correlation ] ) simply means that @xmath1 is not a product state on @xmath33 .",
    "correlations can be obtained from separable states , i.e. from convex combination of product states . since a simple matrix algebra admits a unique normalized trace , states can be uniquely given by density matrices .",
    "hence , product states are characterized by tensor product density matrices and separable states are characterized by separable density matrices , i.e. by convex combinations of tensor product density matrices . since in the real linear space of selfadjoint elements in @xmath33 positive elements @xmath34 form a self - dual cone with respect to the scalar product @xmath35 , the ( convex ) set of states , that is the ( convex ) set of density matrices is even more rich : there also exist non - separable that is entangled states on @xmath33 .",
    "this is due to the existence of positive elements in @xmath33 that can not be written as positive linear combinations of tensor product of positive elements in @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "entangled states lead to inherent and numerically stronger correlations among events contained in different tensor factors of @xmath33 .",
    "separable and entangled states can be distinguished by witness operators @xmath36 which are the non - positive elements in the dual cone @xmath37 of the cone @xmath38 spanned by separable density matrices .",
    "clearly , a witness operator @xmath39 gives rise to inequalities since @xmath40 for any separable state @xmath1 on @xmath33 .",
    "basically , these properties are behind the inequalities for superluminal correlations discussed above .    coming back to the superluminal correlations ( [ corrs ] ) violating the ch inequality ( [ ch_int])/chsh inequality ( [ chsh_int ] )",
    ", it is well known that the violation of these inequalities leads to various no - go theorems excuding a local common causal explanation of the set ( see for example ( shimony 2004 ) and the literature therein ) .",
    "however , all these common causal explanations assume that the common cause is _ commuting _ with the correlating events . hence , a natural question arises : does the noncommutative generalization of the common causes in algebraic quantum field theory give enough freedom to find _ noncommuting _ common causes for a set of correlations violating the ch / chsh inequality ?    in this paper",
    "we will answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the violation of the ch / chsh inequality does _ not _ exclude the existence of a common causal explanation of the set of correlations in question _ if _ we abandon commutativity between the common cause and the outcome events .",
    "moreover , in the given example the noncommuting common cause turns out to be local and supported in the common past i.e. in the intersection of the causal pasts of the correlating events .    in section 2",
    "we reproduce the epr - bohm scenario in the local quantum ising model , which is a prototype of local uhf - type quantum theories . giving a faithful state on the corresponding observable algebra",
    "we show that there is a set @xmath25 of projections having such correlations that maximally violates the ch inequality . in section 3",
    "we introduce the main concepts of a common causal explanation of superluminal correlations and we explicitly construct a common cause of the above four correlations .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "consider the net of ` intervals ' @xmath41 of half - integers .",
    "the set of half - integers can be interpreted as the space coordinates of the center @xmath42 and @xmath43 of minimal double cones @xmath44 of unit diameter on a thickened cauchy surface in two dimensional minkowski space @xmath45 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ strong_bell1 ] . )",

    "they determine a directed subset @xmath50 of double cones in @xmath51 , which is left invariant by the group of space - translations with integer values .",
    "the net of local algebras is defined as follows .",
    "the ` one - point ' observable algebras @xmath52 associated to the minimal double cone @xmath53 are defined to be isomorphic to the direct sum matrix algebra @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the selfadjoint unitary generator of the algebra @xmath56",
    ". between the generators one demands the following commutation relations : @xmath57 now , the local algebras @xmath58 are defined to be the linear span of the monoms @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "specifically , the two - point algebra @xmath61 is spanned by the selfadjoint unitary monoms @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the imaginary unit ) .",
    "they satisfy the same commutation relations like the pauli matrices @xmath64 and @xmath65 in @xmath66 .",
    "the minimal projections in @xmath67 can be parametrized by a unit vector @xmath68 in @xmath69 as follows : @xmath70 and can be interpreted as the event localized in @xmath71 pertaining to the generalized spin measurement in direction @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the three - point algebra @xmath73 is linearly spanned by the selfadjount unitary monoms @xmath74 and any minimal projection in @xmath75 can be written in the form @xmath76 where @xmath72 is again a unit vector in @xmath69 .",
    "since the local algebras @xmath77 for @xmath78 are isomorphic to the full matrix algebra @xmath79 the quasilocal observable algebra @xmath2 is a uniformly hyperfinite ( uhf ) @xmath0-algebra , which possesses a unique ( non - degenerate ) normalized trace @xmath80 .",
    "now , consider the subset @xmath81 of double cones in @xmath51 that are spanned by minimal double cones being integer time translates of those in @xmath50 .",

    "[ strong_bell2 ] ) ,    where the generators @xmath114 are supported , we have to use a causal time evolution @xmath91 to give elements of them .",
    "let @xmath115 and @xmath116 be minimal projections in @xmath112 and in @xmath113 , respectively , given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are four ( @xmath120 ) unit vectors in @xmath69 .",

    "a locally faithful state one can use the convex combination @xmath130 which gives back the singlet state for @xmath131 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the state @xmath134 is defined as the deviation from the product state value : @xmath135 using ( [ a_m])-([b_n ] ) and ( [ rho3 ] ) this correlation reads as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the scalar product in @xmath69 .",
    "therefore @xmath132 and @xmath133 will correlate whenever @xmath138 and @xmath139 are not orthogonal .",

    "then the question arises : does the above set @xmath25 violating the ch inequality have a common causal explanation ? to answer this question we have to characterize what a common causal explanation consists in .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the first characterization of the common cause in terms of a classical probability measure space is due to reichenbach ( 1956 ) .",
    "although reichenbach s original defintion is inappropriate to explain correlations in algebraic quantum field theory for several reasons ( it is classical , it does not take into account the spacetime localization of the events , etc .",
    "; for details see ( hofer - szab and vecsernys , 2012a ) ) , one can easily generalize the notion of the common cause for the non - classical case . here",
    "we repeat only the definition given in ( hofer - szab and vecsernys , 2012a ) because it also embraces the commuting common causes defined in ( rdei 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "let @xmath148 be the ( non - distributive ) lattice of projections ( events ) in a von neumann algebra @xmath149 and let @xmath150 be a state on it .",
    "a set of mutually orthogonal projections @xmath151 is called a _ partition of the unit _",
    "@xmath152 if @xmath153 . such a partition defines a _ conditional expectation _",
    "@xmath154 that is @xmath155 is a unit preserving positive surjection onto the unital @xmath0-subalgebra @xmath156 obeying the bimodule property @xmath157 .",
    "we note that @xmath158 contains exactly those elements of @xmath149 that commute with @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath160 is also a state on @xmath161 we can give the following    [ ncqccs ] a partition of the unit @xmath162 is said to be a _ common cause system _ of the commuting events @xmath163 , which correlate in the state @xmath150 , if @xmath164 for @xmath165 with @xmath166 . if @xmath167 commutes with both @xmath4 and @xmath5 for all @xmath165 we call @xmath168 a _ commuting _ common cause system , otherwise a _ noncommuting _ one . a common cause system of size @xmath169",
    "is called a _ common cause_.",
    "some remarks are in place here .",
    "first , in case of a commuting common cause system @xmath160 can be replaced by @xmath1 in ( [ ncqccs1 ] ) since @xmath170 .",
    "second , using the decompositions of the unit , @xmath171 , ( [ ncqccs1 ] ) can be rewritten in an equivalent form : @xmath172 one can even allow here the case @xmath173 since then both sides of ( [ ncqccsrew ] ) are zero .",
    "we also have to specify the spacetime localization of the possible common causes of the correlations .",
    "one can define different pasts of the bounded contractible regions @xmath174 and @xmath175 in a spacetime @xmath176 as : @xmath177 where @xmath178 denotes the union of the backward light cones @xmath179 of every point @xmath180 in @xmath87 ( rdei , summers 2007 ) . clearly , @xmath181 .    with these different localizations of the common cause in hand",
    "now we can define various common cause systems in local quantum theories according to ( i ) whether commutativity is required and ( ii ) where the common cause system is localized .",
    "thus we can speak about _ commuting / noncommuting ( weak / strong ) common cause systems_.    since in our model of the previous section we have not one pair of correlating events but four , we need also the notion of the joint common cause system :    [ lcccs ] let @xmath182 be the observable net in a local quantum theory and let @xmath183 and @xmath184 be finite sets of projections in the algebras @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively , supported in spacelike separated regions @xmath187 .",
    "suppose that all pair of spacelike separated projections @xmath188 correlate in a state @xmath1 of @xmath2 .",
    "then the set of correlations is said to possess a commuting / noncommuting ( weak / strong ) _ joint _ common cause system if there exists _ a single _ commuting / noncommuting ( weak / strong ) common cause system for _ all _ correlations @xmath189 .",
    "having defined what a common causal explanation means we answer the question raised at the end of the previous section in the affirmative : we explicitly contruct a noncommuting joint common cause for the set @xmath25 of correlations violating the ch inequalities ( [ ch_int ] ) .",
    "first , observe that without specifying the dynamics we only can talk about _ weak _ ( commuting or noncommuting ) common cause or joint common cause .",
    "the reason for this is the following . to be able to talk about the correlation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 we need to consider a local algebra containing both @xmath132 and @xmath133 . to be able to talk about a common cause system @xmath190 of this correlation",
    "we need a local algebra that contains @xmath190 too .",
    "let us consider the piece @xmath191 of a cauchy surface contained in the _ weak _ past of @xmath192 and @xmath193 , which is the shadowed region in fig .",
    "[ strong_bell3 ] , that is the support of a hypothetical weak common cause system @xmath190 of the correlation .    due to primitive causality",
    "the algebra corresponding to @xmath191 is equal to the algebra @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the smallest double cone containing @xmath191 .",
    "since @xmath196 contains both @xmath192 and @xmath193 isotony implies that @xmath197 for any causal dynamics . hence , the hypothetical weak common cause system @xmath190 and the events @xmath198 are in the common algebra @xmath194 . in ( hofer - szab , vecsernys 2012a )",
    "it was shown that a weak noncommuting common cause can be found for a _ single _ correlation @xmath199 in local uhf - type quantum theories without the explicit knowledge of the dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath200 is the piece of a cauchy surface contained in the _ common _ past of @xmath192 and @xmath193 then neither @xmath192 nor @xmath193 are contained in @xmath201 .",
    "therefore @xmath129 and @xmath202 are not related by isotony , and one should find a proper cauchy surface piece @xmath200 in the common past and an integer time shift @xmath203 such that @xmath204 holds .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ strong_bell3b ] . )",
    "then the corresponding algebras are related by the dynamics @xmath205 where the last equality is due to time translation covariance .",
    "thus for finding a joint common cause in the local quantum ising model one has to specify the dynamics .",
    "let us therefore choose a special set of dynamics by fixing two parameters of the causal dynamics : @xmath206 . by this choice the time translation automorphism ( [ causal_automorph2 ] ) reads as follows : @xmath207 for every @xmath101 .",
    "this specification of the dynamics converts events @xmath132 and @xmath133 in ( [ a_m])-([b_n ] ) into @xmath208 and the density matrix ( [ rho3 ] ) into @xmath209    since @xmath210 is in the common past of @xmath192 and @xmath193 , it would be a possible choice for the support of a hypothetical joint common cause system .",
    "however , as it will turn out soon , using this dynamics we will be able to localize a ( noncommuting ) common cause @xmath211 of the correlation in a smaller spacetime region within @xmath212 , namely in @xmath213 .",
