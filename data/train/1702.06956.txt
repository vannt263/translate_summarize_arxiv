    "the large uncertainty makes it hard to conclude whether the source spectrum was softer than _ xmm - newton _ observations , though it was significantly fainter .",
    "the long - term luminosity evolution of the source based on the mcd fits is shown in figure  [ fig : ltlumlc ] .",
    "the source could be in an x - ray outburst , with the peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath65 erg s@xmath7 , reached in the second and third _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the x - ray luminosity had decreased to @xmath0@xmath66 erg s@xmath7 in the _ chandra _ observation .",

    "the bolometric luminosity had decreased to @xmath0  @xmath68 erg s@xmath7 in the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the main result of our follow - up observation of xj1231 + 1106 is the detection of the significant drop and softening of its x - ray emission , suggesting that the source is probably in the decay of an x - ray outburst that has last for @xmath313 years . because the narrow emission lines in the host galaxy spectrum signal the presence of a low - luminosity type-2 agn , in principle we can not completely rule out that the x - ray outburst is purely due to agn activity .",
    "however , pure thermal x - ray spectra are atypical for agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the large variability of the source is uncommon for agns too ( only 1.5% of agns vary in x - rays by a factor of @xmath310 , * ? ? ?",
    "one possible explanation for xj1231 + 1106 is an agn flare caused by a disk instability , as proposed for ngc 3599 @xcite and ic 3599 @xcite .",
    "the disk instability can cause large variability on timescales of years for agns .",
    "however , we note that this mechanism is still poorly understood and that the observational evidence is still vague . for ngc 3599 and ic 3599 , alternative explanations , especially tdes ,",
    "are still possible @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation for the x - ray outburst of xj1231 + 1106 is an agn just entering a luminous thermal state , a common spectral state for bh x - ray binaries , in which the x - ray spectra were dominated by emission from a standard thermal thin disk .",
    "this explanation was proposed to explain the super - soft semi - persistent x - ray outburst of gsn 069 @xcite .",
    "however , such a state would last @xmath69 years in agns if the analogy between bh x - ray binary transients and agn holds , and this is in conflict with our detection of the large variability of the source flux within 10 years .",
    "pure thermal x - ray spectra are commonly observed in sources suspected to be tdes .",
    "therefore @xcite discussed xj1231 + 1106 as a possible tde .",
    "this is further supported by our new detection of the outburst - like large variability of the source .",
    "one main difference between xj1231 + 1106 and other tde candidates is its slow evolution .",
    "the x - ray flux of other tde candidates typically decreased by an order of magnitude in one year right after they were discovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it took 10 years for the x - ray flux of xj1231 + 1106 to decrease by one order of magnitude .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _ observation was even fainter ( by a factor of 2 ) than the other two _ xmm - newton _ observations 2.4 years later .",
    "the x - ray spectral softening observed in xj1231 + 1106 with the decrease in the x - ray flux has been observed in some tde candidates @xcite , but not in all cases . in the well monitored tde candidate asassn-14li , steady blackbody temperatures in the x - ray spectra were observed despite the drop of the x - ray flux nearly by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "it is not clear what caused the above difference .",
    "the slow decay and spectral softening of the x - ray emission makes xj1231 + 1106 somewhat similar to a long - lived tde candidate 3xmm  j150052.0 + 015452 , which showed little decay of the x - ray flux over 10 years after it went into an x - ray outburst and displayed dramatic spectral softening , from quasi - soft ( @xmath70 kev ) to super - soft ( @xmath71 kev ) x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "one explanation for the slow decay of that source is the combination of slow circularization and super - eddington accretion effects .",
    "slow circularization occurs when the fallback of mass is faster than the accretion and have been predicted in many recent studies @xcite . such events would evolve slower than those with prompt accretion .",
    "tdes could have accretion rates above the eddington limit initially . in this phase ,",
    "significant super - eddington effects of photon trapping and outflows in the inner disk region are expected @xcite .",
    "these effects are stronger at higher accretion rates , resulting in a disk luminosity sustained at around the eddington limit",
    ". therefore the decay of the flux would appear slow in the super - eddington accretion phase .",
    "the identification of a long super - eddington accretion phase in 3xmm  j150052.0 + 015452 was strongly supported by the generally quasi - soft x - ray spectra , whose characteristic temperatures are too high to be explained by the standard thermal thin disk below the eddington limit , but are consistent with comptonized emission from a low - temperature optical thick corona .",
    "similar spectra are commonly seen in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) @xcite , most of which are believed to be super - eddington accreting stellar - mass bhs , except that 3xmm  j150052.0 + 015452 had orders of magnitude higher luminosities .",
    "xj1231 + 1106 was most likely in the thermal state , instead of a super - eddington accretion state , in the _ swift _ and _ chandra _ observations , given the much lower luminosity and softer spectra in these observations than in the _ xmm - newton _ ones .",
    "the spectral state identification for the _ xmm - newton _ observations is more subtle .",
    "@xcite found that the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray spectra can be described with either pure thermal disk emission ( i.e. , the standard thermal state ) or optically thick low - temperature comptonization ( characteristic of a super - eddington accretion state ) .",
    "the former model requires a sub - eddington luminosity . due to the relatively high disk temperatures , this model required the bh to have mass @xmath010@xmath72  and some spin .",
    "if the source was instead in a super - eddington accretion state in the _ xmm - newton _ observations , the bh should have mass below @xmath73  ( but above @xmath74 , so that it can be in the standard thermal state in the _ swift _ and _ chandra _ observations ) . in either case , the bh mass should be small , agreeing with the estimate by @xcite and a little lower than our estimate above based on the stellar mass ( the difference is not significant due to large scatter of the relation used ) .    in figure  [",
    "fig : ltlumlc ] , we plot a model of the luminosity evolution assuming a full disruption of a solar - type star by a smbh of mass @xmath9 , with prompt accretion ( i.e. , the mass accretion rate is equal to the mass fallback rate ) . in this case , the rising time is expected to be @xmath751 month @xcite .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _",
    "observation should be in the rising phase because the source had a lower luminosity in this observation than in the two observations 2.4 years later .",
    "the super - eddington accretion phase can last for 4.8 years @xcite .",
    "therefore the source luminosity was assumed to be constant in the initial 4.8 years , at the eddington limit @xcite , which was adopted to be that seen in the second _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "after the super - eddington accretion phase , the luminosity followed the standard evolution of the mass accretion rate as @xmath76 @xcite , where @xmath77 is the disruption time , assumed to be one month before the first _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "this simple model of a tde of prompt accretion seems to describe the data well .",
    "however , it would be highly coincident that the first _ xmm - newton _ observation caught the fast rise .",
    "alternatively , it could be a tde of slow circularization and thus of a relatively long rising phase @xcite .",
    "tidal stripping of an evolved star could also result in a relatively slow event @xcite .",
    "however , tdes of evolved stars should be very rare for a black hole of mass @xmath9 , accounting for only @xmath03% of the total tdes @xcite .",
    "besides , in such events , the partial disruption is more likely , resulting in low luminosities @xcite , while our source had peak luminosity around the eddington limit .    as shown in the bpt diagrams , the narrow emission lines in the sdss spectrum of gj1231 + 1106 could in some part be due to persistent nuclear activity .",
    "then we expect the presence of a hard x - ray component if it is a normal agn .",
    "the strength of this hard x - ray component can be estimated based on its normal correlation with the [ ] @xmath85007 emission line @xcite .",
    "the [ ] @xmath85007 emission line absorbed luminosity is @xmath78 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the observed h@xmath48/h@xmath49 ratio is @xmath79 , and assuming an intrinsic value of the ratio to be 3.1 would imply an intrinsic reddening of @xmath80 mag ( galactic reddening @xmath40 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "correcting for this reddening , the [ ] @xmath85007 luminosity is @xmath81 erg s@xmath7 . using the [ ] @xmath85007 and 210 kev luminosity relation in @xcite , whose dispersion is 0.63 dex , we estimated the persistent 210 kev luminosity to be @xmath82 erg s@xmath7 ( the @xmath54 uncertainty has included the dispersion of the relation used ) .",
    "assuming an absorbed power - law of photon index 2.0 and galactic absorption , we expect to collect @xmath83 counts in 27 kev and @xmath84 counts in 0.77 kev in the _ chandra _ observation but only 1.5 net counts were detected in 0.77 kev .",
    "however , given the large uncertainty of the above estimate and the possible contribution of star - forming activity to the narrow emission lines , we can not completely rule out that a persistent weak hard x - ray component is present but is too weak to be detected .",
    "alternatively , it could be possible that the tde has destroyed the corona or jet that is responsible for hard x - ray emission .",
