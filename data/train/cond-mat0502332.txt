    "one of the interesting phenomena that ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  displays is a mott transition to a metallic phase that occurs at t=357  k upon heating under ambient conditions .",
    "the insulating mott phase in ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  can also be suppressed by a moderate pressure @xcite . at room temperature ,",
    "ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  becomes metallic at about 0.5  gpa .",
    "for slightly higher pressure it stays metallic down to lowest temperatures and exhibits ferromagnetic order below t@xmath610  k. the mott transition in both cases  i.e. as function of temperature and of pressure  coincides with a structural transition .",
    "the electronic structure of ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 i.e. orbital occupation in its insulating as well as in its metallic phase , is still under debate @xcite . in view of the crossover from antiferro-",
    "to ferromagnetism the pressure dependence of ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  is of particular interest , because it provides the possibility to study the interplay between the structure and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is possible that the understanding of the ferromagnetic phase of ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  might also be helpful to explain the phenomena in , in which for 0.2@xmath7x@xmath70.5 metamagnetic behaviour and an almost ferromagnetic state near @xmath8=0.5 is observed @xcite .",
    "this article , describing the structure solution and direct observation of magnetic ordering by neutron and x - ray diffraction , addresses the current lack of information concerning the nature of the high pressure phase .",

    "we used helium gas pressure cells and a constant wavelength @xmath11@xmath12 ; the maximum pressure was 0.6  gpa . at f3 diamond anvil cells ( bridgman type , 0.6",
    "mm diameter , pressure medium liquid nitrogen ) were used and the lattice constants were calculated from the peak positions in the energy dispersive powder diffraction spectra . the measurement covers the pressure region up to 15  gpa .    for the detailed structural analysis ,",
    "rietveld refinable data were collected using the pearl / hipr time - of - flight diffractometer at isis on a powder sample up to a pressure of almost 10  gpa ( paris - edinburgh - cell ) . as the pressure was not measured directly in this setup ,",
    "the pressure was obtained by a fit of the lattice constants to the equation of state ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "all these measurements were done at room temperature .",
    "on two different single crystals , elastic neutron diffraction was measured on the in12 triple axis spectrometer at the ill , grenoble , with a clamp cell .",
    "these measurements were performed in ( 100)-(010 ) and in ( 100)-(001 ) geometry ( scattering plane ) , respectively .",
    "they covered the temperature range between 1.5  k and room temperature .",
    "crystal sizes in this case were only a few mm@xmath13  note that up to now large ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  single crystals are generally not available because they usually do not withstand the discontinuous structural transition at 357  k. by the use of a triple axis instrument the relatively high background caused by the pressure cell was significantly reduced .",
    "as the first step of the structural analysis the pressure dependence of the lattice constants , i.  e. the equation of state , was determined up to 15  gpa .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in upstroke",
    ", one observes at 0.5  gpa the discontinuous transition from the _ s - pbca _ into the _",
    "l - pbca _ phase . our structural analysis",
    "( see below ) shows that it is well justified to call these phases ( named according to the short , respectively long lattice constant @xmath14 ) exactly like the phases which appear in the phase diagram of ca@xmath15sr@xmath16ruo@xmath1  @xcite , because this transition is very similar to the one which occurs in ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1upon heating above 357k at ambient pressure .",
    "it is of strong first order character and displays a hysteresis of @xmath170.1  gpa ( transition around 0.4  gpa in downstroke ) . at this transition ,",
    "the lattice volume decreases by about 0.85% , which is slightly more than at the temperature driven transition at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "so this transition has to be regarded as just the same transition as the temperature - driven one which is susceptible to pressure because of its negative volume change . above this first - order transition , the orthorhombic",
    "splitting has opposite sign ( @xmath18 ) , but the difference is very small and below the limit of detection in the synchrotron spectra ; however the pearl / hipr neutron diffraction results ( see table ) yield a splitting @xmath19 around @xmath20 . although it is obvious that pressure stabilizes the state with lower volume , the discontinuous increase of @xmath14 and the positive @xmath21 over a wide pressure range are remarkable .",
    "the tilt angle shown is the average of @xmath22(o2 ) and @xmath23(o1 ) .",
    "( note that the pressure range is smaller than in figure [ fig1 ] . )",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    the results of the full structure refinement of the data collected at pearl / hipr are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "for the refinement , the programs gsas @xcite and fullprof @xcite were used , and the results checked for consistency . during the refinement ,",
    "special attention was paid to the determination of the characteristic structural distortions , i.e. the rotation angle of the ruo@xmath2-octahedra around their vertical axis ( @xmath24 c ) , @xmath25 , and the tilt angle @xmath23 around an axis in the basal plane ( @xmath24b and parallel to two of the o - o - bonds ; for further details see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.[fig3 ] .    in the high pressure region , where the tilt distortion is only small",
    ", we described the spectra with different structural models , in which a tilt of the octahedra , caused by a nonzero @xmath26-position of the o(1)-atom ( basal oxygen ) and nonzero @xmath8 and @xmath27 of o(2 ) ( apical oxygen ) , was allowed or forbidden , respectively .",
    "it turned out that above 7  gpa there was no significant difference in the r - values , which would justify the lower symmetry .",
    "it was also possible to fix the horizontal ca - positions to zero without affecting the quality of the fit .",
    "in contrast , at pressures lower than 5  gpa satisfactory descriptions can only be obtained in the usual _ pbca _ symmetry . at 5  gpa",
    "the difference between the two models is only small , but the calculated angles are still significantly above zero .    with respect to fig.[fig1 ] , one may argue that the lattice constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 and as well the cell volume display an anomaly between 5 and 6  gpa : a maximum in @xmath14 and a kink in @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath28 .",
    "below , the compressibility is @xmath29 , and above , it is only @xmath30 .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively very similar to that observed upon heating at ambient pressure , see fig.[fig2 ] , where ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 undergoes a second transition to a higher symmetric phase at 650  k@xcite .",
    "this analogy allows a relatively precise determination of the pressure at which the phase transition occurs from the data in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that close to 5.5  gpa the tilt completely vanishes and ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1  undergoes a continuous phase transition to a phase with space group _ bbcm _ ( standard setting _ acam _ ) , which is characterized by a rotation of the ruo@xmath2-octahedra around the vertical axis only .",
    "this is the distortion pattern which is also found in gd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "note that the space group of this phase has to be distinguished from the tetragonal space group _ i4@xmath31/acd _ , which is found @xcite in ca@xmath15sr@xmath16ruo@xmath1  and which is also characterized by the ruo@xmath2 rotation around @xmath14 , because the sense of the rotation with respect to second nearest neighbor planes is different .",
    "( this leads to a twice as long lattice constant @xmath14 in the case of _ i4@xmath31/acd _ , @xmath32 , compared to _",
    "_ pbca_. ) another difference is that in the orthorhombic space group _ bbcm _ a very small orthorhombicity seems to remain . due to the absence of the tilt ,",
    "this reflects the deformation of the octahedron basal plane .",
    "the symmetry also allows for a splitting of the in - plane ru - o bond lengths . whether this is the case ,",
    "could not unambiguously be determined @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the tilt , the rotational distortion is quite insensitive to pressure ; it even increases slightly ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "ruo@xmath1 at ambient pressure as measured by x - ray diffraction . ]    the uncommon behaviour of the lattice constant @xmath14 is reflected in the bond length between ru and o(2 ) , which increases under pressure up to 5  gpa , while the ru - o(1 ) bond length decreases continuously .",
    "this is obviously correlated to the observed pressure dependence of the resistivity @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath34 increasing , @xmath33 decreasing ) @xcite  the enhanced overlap of the in - plane orbitals corresponds to the usual effect of pressure and may explain the higher conductivity .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the pressure dependencies of @xmath23 and @xmath25 in view of theoretical calculations that have been carried out on the  phase diagram @xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "nakamura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite determined the evolution of the ferromagnetic ordering temperature ( partly deduced from resistivity measurements ) with pressure .",
    "it increases from 10  k just above the phase transition to its maximum of 25  k at a pressure @xmath175  gpa , i.e. the increase coincides with the reduction of the tilt angle , and the pressure where the tilt angle finally vanishes is near the maximum of @xmath35 .",
    "fang and terakura @xcite performed calculations considering the influence of structural distortions on the magnetic properties .",
    "they find that the octahedron rotation favors a ferromagnetic ground state due to the smaller bandwidth of ru @xmath36 , whereas the tilting has the opposite effect .",
    "this fits well to the fact that the maximum ordering temperature is at the same pressure where we find the tilt disappearing ( at 300k ) . on the other hand",
    ", our structural analysis shows that below 5 gpa there are relatively large tilt angles which obviously do not prevent ( ferro-)magnetic order . near @xmath35 ,",
    "i.e. at low temperature we even expect the tilt angle to be larger , although there is no structure determination at low temperature in this pressure region yet .",
    "the occurrence of ferromagnetism in the tilt distorted structure is also remarkable in view of the fact that in the phase diagram of ca@xmath15sr@xmath16ruo@xmath1  it is the octahedron s tilt setting in below a critical sr - concentration x=0.5 which induces antiferromagnetic correlations and drives the system very rapidly away from a ferromagnetic instability @xcite .

    "this region is broader ; in raman studies by snow _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the two phase state could be observed up to @xmath17 1  gpa , and measurements of magnetization and resistivity @xcite indicate that small amounts of the insulating phase persist even up to @xmath17 2  gpa .",

    ", this is consistent with the value of the remnant magnetization .",

    "in contrast to macroscopic measurement methods , the direct observation by neutron scattering can give the information whether there are other types of magnetic order than ferromagnetism which fully or partially determine the observed magnetic properties .",
    "however , although measured at several positions in reciprocal space , neither type of incommensurate or antiferromagnetic order could be detected .",

    "our examination of magnetic order by elastic neutron scattering supports this scenario of itinerant ferromagnetism as the only one that can account for the magnetic properties of pressurized ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .      a further result concerns the _ s - pbca _ phase and its antiferromagnetic order ( @xmath5=112  k at @xmath41=0  gpa ) . the ordered moment on the ru sites points along the @xmath10-direction of the lattice @xcite .",

    "we conclude that there is a single magnetic phase of this type , in contrast to the behavior of the _ s - pbca _ phase at ambient pressure .",
    "we did not determine the full temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering corresponding to the b - type antiferromagnetic order , but at @xmath46150  k these reflections had entirely disappeared .",

    "the reason for this alteration of the magnetic order from a- to b - type is not obvious , as the coupling between different layers is not yet well understood .",
    "however one may argue that this effect is the same as that seen in the sr - doped samples : very small amounts of sr  despite the bigger size of the sr - ion  have a similar effect on the lattice constants and their temperature dependence as the application of pressure @xcite , so the same subtle structural effect may be the reason for this .",
