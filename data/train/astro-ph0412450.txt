    "dwarf novae are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a late - type main - sequence secondary transferring gaseous matter via the roche lobe overflow .",
    "the transferred gas forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf .",
    "the accretion disk gives rise to various kinds of instabilities and variabilities ( for a review , see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the two major instabilities are thermal and tidal instabilities , which are responsible for dwarf nova - type outbursts and superhumps , respectively ( for a review , see @xcite ) . su uma - type stars , subclass of dwarf novae , satisfy both instabilities .",
    "it is widely recognized that su uma - type dwarf novae have a subgroup , called wz sge - type dwarf novae [ originally proposed by @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae are one of the most enigmatic systems all over the dwarf novae ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are only five objects that have been firmly classified into wz sge - type dwarf novae , hv vir , al com , eg cnc , rz leo , and wz sge itself .",
    "recent paper @xcite lists possible candidates for wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "the mass ratios of these systems have been suggested to be much smaller than those of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "criteria for wz sge - type dwarf novae are that ( 1 ) a supercycle , which is a period between two succeeding superoutbursts , is over 5 years , much longer than those of su uma - type dwarf novae , ( 2 ) their outbursts show very large amplitudes exceeding 6 mag , and ( 3 ) near the maximum of a superoutburst , early superhumps , having doubly - peaked shapes and periods close to the @xmath0 , are observed for about a few days before emergence of ordinary superhumps . historically , @xcite pointed out that go com is a candidate for wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "however , the lack of observations has prevented us from clarification .",
    "go com was discovered by @xcite as an eruptive object on a palomar plate taken on 1973 july 1.213 .",
    "this variable was confirmed to be identical with the suspected variable star csvs 1959 = svs 382 discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the orbital period of go com to be 95 min .",
    "being located extremely close to the north galactic pole and in the sa 57 region , this object was independently recorded as a very blue object of @xmath1=18.1 ( us 31 ) during a systematic survey of this region @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "this object has one of the most unusual colors ( u@xmath2b = @xmath21.5 ) in this region .",
    "this object is also cataloged as a quasar candidate omhr j125637.12 + 263644.2 @xcite .",
    "the object has been visually monitored by the members of the variable star observers league in japan ( vsolj ) since 1986 , and only one short outburst was observed on 1989 may 30 ( m@xmath3=13.2 ) until 1995 .",
    "this 1989 outburst showed a rapid decline by about 1 mag d@xmath4 , suggesting that the outburst would be a normal outburst of a short - period dwarf nova .",
    "although there were unavoidable seasonal gaps in monitoring , the extremely low outburst frequency of this dwarf nova has been established by this observation .",
    "the apparent absence of long outbursts , infrequent short outbursts , and possible excursion to a low state ( as indirectly inferred from the literature ) have suggested similarity to the unusual short - period dwarf nova bz uma ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively strong x - ray emission detected by rosat @xcite also suggests the unusual nature of go com .    in 1990",
    ", @xcite conducted first - ever time - resolved ccd photometry of go com near its quiescence , and reported the possible presence of a periodicity of 33 min .",
    "@xcite found a possible 95-min periodicity by ccd photometry .",
    "although this period was tentatively related to the possible orbital period , the short observation was not sufficient to conclude on the reality of this periodicity . we have had to wait for more than a decade before the true periodicity is confirmed by the present observation .",
    "the 1995 july outburst was detected by vanmunster on 1995 july 16 , which was confirmed by ccd observation on july 25 at @xmath5=16.6 @xcite .",
    "the most unusual feature of this outburst was that this outburst preceded a long outburst by 14 d. this ` second ' outburst very much looked like a superoutburst of su uma - type dwarf novae@xcite , although the limited visibility hindered secure detection of superhumps .",
    "the object even underwent a rebrightening following this outburst .",
    "all of these observations suggested that go com is a genuine su uma - type dwarf novae , and that the 1995 july outburst can be best interpreted as a precursor outburst to the following presumable superoutburst ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since then , there have been only four outbursts on the vsnethttp://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/@xmath6 record : 1996 march , 1997 february , 1998 april , and 2003 june .",
    "the outbursts other than the last one were short and faint outbursts .",
    "the ccd observations were performed by the international vsnet @xcite collaboration team at 14 sites .",
    "a summary of the observations and the equipment used in each site is listed in table 1 .",
    "the images were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded and analyzed with the aperture photometry .",
    "the kyoto and riken images were analysed using a java - based aperture and psf photometry package developed by one of the authors ( tk ) .",
    "the hida images were analysed using iraf .",
    "the other images were analyzed using aip4win .",
    "the magnitude scales of each observatory were adjusted to that of the most abundant tashkent system ( tkr in table 1 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the object were determined relatively using a local standard star , gsc1995.488 , whose constancy during the run was confirmed using a check star , gsc1995.1151 .",
    "heliocentric corrections to the observation times were applied before the following analysis .",
    "as mentioned above , extensive monitoring of the object has been performed by many amateur astronomers .",
    "data points which include negative observations amount to more than 4000 since 1995 . however , despite the secure observations , only 2 superoutbursts have been detected .",
    "table 2 represents the records of outbursts of go com .",
    "one can roughly estimate a supercycle of go com about 2800 days , judging from the two succeeding superoutbursts in 1995 july and 2003 june .",
    "the resultant light curve of the superoutburst is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we derived the decline rate of 0.15 mag d@xmath7@xmath8 during the plateau stage , which lasted for 8 days , from hjd2452796 to hjd2452804 .",
    "the most significant fact is that the duration of the plateau stage is considerably shorter than that of normal su uma - type dwarf novae , whose duration is typically about 2 weeks ( table 3.7 . in @xcite ) .",
    "after the termination of the steep decline , the object entered the post - superoutburst stage during which the object stayed more than about 1 mag brighter than in quiescence ( b=18.1 , mentioned above , and typically b - v @xmath9 0 in dwarf novae ) . a rebrightening feature is sometimes observed during this stage , especially among su uma - type dwarf novae with shorter orbital periods and wz sge - type dwarf novae . there is a hint of a rebrightening feature around hjd2452811 , however , the lack of later data has hindered us from confirmation of rebrightening .",
    "the result of a period analysis is depicted in figure 2 , applying the pdm method @xcite to a data set covering the period from hjd2452795 to hjd2452801 after subtracting the linear decline trend .",
    "we obtained the mean superhump period @xmath10 of 0.06297(3 ) d. figure 3 represents the phase - averaged mean superhump profile .",
    "the rapid - rise and slow - decline trend is characteristic of superhumps in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this superhump period seems to be shorter than the orbital period derived by @xcite .",
    "precise measurement of the orbital period of go com is urged .    in order to investigate variations of superhump profile",
    ", we also derived the daily - averaged profiles of superhumps , shown in figure 4 .",
    "the superhump amplitude on hjd2452795 , corresponding to the very day when the superoutburst started , was as large as 0.4 mag , which gradually decayed during the following 8 days .",
    "however , at the end of a plateau stage , superhumps clearly regrew .",
    "similar phenomena were observed su uma - type dwarf novae with longer supercycle ( see e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we derived the timings of the superhump maxima mainly by eye .",
    "the accuracy of the eye estimates of the timings is around 0.001 d. the results are listed in table 3 .",
    "a linear regression to the times yielded the following equation ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the cycle count since hjd2452795.1571 . by fitting the deviations of the observed timings from the calculation",
    ", we obtained the following equation ,    @xmath13    the quadratic term corresponds to @xmath14/@xmath15 = 1.8@xmath1610@xmath17 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this means that the superhump period became longer , as shown in some su uma - type dwarf novae with shorter orbital periods @xcite .",
    "figure 5 also gives us a hint of a late superhump , around hjd 2452802 .",
    "however , it is difficult to examine it because of lacking of data .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae sometimes undergo a superoutburst following a normal outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "we call such a normal outburst precursor .",
    "thanks to the excellent coverage , the early stage of the present outburst is considered as a precursor before the superoutburst .",
    "figure 1 indicates a decline of the precursor on hjd2452794 .",
    "our calculation revealed that the mean decline rate of magnitude during the precursor was 0.74 mag d@xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "figure 6 represents the precursor profile folded by p=0.063059 d after subtracting the decline trend . judging from figure 6",
    ", there exists no superhump profile as is seen in a superoutburst of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "as mentioned above , during a superoutburst , the amplitude and plateau stage of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae are 4@xmath96 mag and @xmath92 weeks , respectively @xcite . on the other hand , during the 2003 superoutburst of go com , the amplitude and plateau stage of the object are @xmath95 mag and @xmath98 days , respectively .",
    "especially , the plateau stage of go com is remarkably shorter than that of typical su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this may indicate that the accumulated mass on the accretion disk in quiescence is low in go com .    according to the disk instability theory ,",
    "if an outburst is triggered in an accretion disk with a relatively low mass , the system is expected to have a short supercycle . however , in the case of go com , the observations suggest a long supercycle of @xmath92800 days and a moderately short superhump period of 0.063059 days .",
    "these results are beyond the framework of the standard disk instability model .    in order to account for the observations",
    ", we propose that high efficiency of mass accretion onto the white dwarf is realized during quiescence , this scenario was originally suggested by @xcite : the short plateau stage and the long supercycle are due to inner truncation of the accretion disk .",
    "similar interpretation is discussed on ll and by @xcite .",
    "ll and is an su uma - type dwarf nova with an extremely long supercycle ( @xmath95000 d ) , comparable to that of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "the obtained light curve of the 1993 superoutburst of ll and is remarkably similar to that of go com in terms of a small superoutburst amplitude and a short plateau stage .",
    "table 4 demonstrates fundamental characteristics of go com and ll and . in conjunction with our observations",
    ", we conclude that the inner part of the accretion disk may be truncated , as modeled by @xcite .",
    "note , however , that various durations of superoutbursts have been observed in certain objects(e.g",
    ". sw uma,@xcite ) .",
    "further observations are needed in order to clarify superoutburst propeties of go com .      in general , the period of superhump in su uma - type dwarf novae decreases during a superoutburst ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath14/@xmath15 has a rather common negative value ( @xmath9 - 5@xmath1610@xmath18)@xcite , which has been generally ascribed to decreasing apsidal motion due to a decreasing disk radius .",
    "@xcite pointed out mass depletion from the disk results in the decrease of superhump period .",
    "however , recent observations reveal that the minority of su uma - type dwarf novae has positive @xmath14/@xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .. ] @xcite suggested that an increase in superhump periods may be related to a low mass ratio and/or a low mass transfer rate .",
    "ei psc @xcite , however , obviously violates these regime : @xcite derived a high mass ratio ( q = @xmath19/@xmath20 = 0.19@xmath210.02 ) by using the empirical relation between superhump excess and mass ratio @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations for ei psc also indicate the high mass transfer rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . it is suggested that another condition may be required for explaining positive @xmath14 .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates a @xmath14/@xmath15 diagram of su uma - type dwarf novae ( including wz sge - type dwarf novae ) .",
    "note that the obtained @xmath14/@xmath15 of go com is the second largest ever known .",
    "in addition , the location of go com in figure 7 are far from the general trend from upper - left to lower - right , implying a peculiar nature of go com .",
    "observations before the maximum allow us to test the validity of a refinement of the thermal - tidal instability model developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that a superoutburst which is accompanied with a precursor should develop superhumps after the termination of the precursor , i.e. , as soon as a superoutburst is triggered , superhumps emerge . in this point ,",
    "our observations are in agreement with the prediction by @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the possibilities of the presence of superhumps during the precursor .",
    "@xcite found a hump - like profile with an amplitude smaller than 0.1 mag during a precursor of the 1993 superoutburst in t leo .",
    "he suggested that this modulation and the superhump were caused by the same origin , based on the fact that the ephemeris of the superhump - maximum timings during the superoutburst was applicable to that of the modulations during the precursor .",
    "this implies that a tidal instability developed before the main superoutburst .",
    "however , in the case of go com , there is no evidence of superhumps during the precursor .",
    "the reason for the difference is left as an open question .      as mentioned above ,",
    "historical records indicate that the supercycle of go com is about 2800 day , which is considerably longer than well - known su uma - type dwarf novae ( 200 - 350 d ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , from the point of supercycle , go com is similar to wz sge - type dwarf novae , although their supercycles are much longer than that of go com .    however , go com underwent normal outbursts more frequently than superoutbursts .",
    "observations reveal that wz sge - type dwarf novae enter a normal outburst very infrequently .",
    "theories predict that an extremely low viscosity on an accretion disk during quiescence leads wz sge - type dwarf novae to have a long dormancy ( @xcite ) . in the case of go com , assuming the analogy with wz sge - type dwarf novae , rather frequent normal outbursts may not be explained .",
    "thus , the viscosity in the accretion disk is not necessarily low during quiescence .",
    "we also investigated the possibility of the existence of an early superhump on hjd 2452795 , one day before the maximum .",
    "however , the profiles we detected was not doubly peaked , but singly peaked . therefore , the modulations on hjd 2452795 were definitely ordinary superhumps .",
    "in addition , precursor outbursts are not shown among wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "that s why we disqualify go com as wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "our photometrical study in this paper is summarized as follows .",
    "\\4 . judging from long - term monitoring , the supercycle of go com is about 2800 d , whereas the amplitude of the 2003 superoutburst was less than 5 mag . in conjunction with its plateau stage of",
    "go com ( 8 days ) , the total mass accretion onto the white dwarf might be low .",
    "we are grateful to many vsnet observers who have reported vital observations .",
    "we are particularly grateful to christopher jones for promptly reporting the outbursts through vsnet .",

    "<S> the mean superhump period was 0.063059(13 ) d. the resultant data revealed that ( 1 ) the obtained light curve contained a precursor , ( 2 ) a plateau stage of the object lasted 8 days , which is remarkably shorter than that of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , and ( 3 ) the amplitude of the superoutburst was less than 5 mag , which is unpredictably small when taking into account the fact that the supercycle of go com is about 2800 days . in order to explain these anomalies , </S>",
    "<S> a mass elimination process from the accretion disk , such as evaporation , may play an important role . </S>"
