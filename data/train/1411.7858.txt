    "the recently discovered iron - arsenide superconductors of the novel 10 - 3 - 8 structure type containing platinum arsenide intermediary layers , ( cafe@xmath1pt@xmath2as)@xmath3pt@xmath4as@xmath5 , are a rare example of an unconventional superconductor family with a triclinic crystal structure @xcite .",
    "their structural and physical properties still remain a subject of current investigation @xcite .",
    "an interesting peculiarity of these systems is that they display a large difference in their optimal critical temperature , @xmath9 , and ground - state properties depending on the amount of pt in the intermediary pt@xmath17as@xmath18 spacer layer ( @xmath19 or 4 ) @xcite . while the parent compound of the 10 - 3 - 8 family is not superconducting and only displays superconductivity upon doping @xcite , in the related 10 - 4 - 8 family the optimal @xmath20k is reached already in the stoichiometric parent phase and can only be suppressed by doping @xcite .",
    "still , the identical @xmath9 for the undoped 10 - 4 - 8 and optimally rare - earth doped 10 - 3 - 8 compounds @xcite reveal their close resemblance behind structural differences .    since pt , which acts as a dopant , is already present in the intermediary layers , growing a large single crystal of the stoichiometric parent compound without any pt doping on the fe site still represents a challenge .",
    "a further complication comes from the coexistence of multiple twin domains in the same crystal due to the triclinic lattice structure @xcite .",
    "initially , there was no consensus about the presence or nature of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order in the 10 - 3 - 8 parent compound . at first ,",
    "no such order was observed @xcite , unlike in most other iron - pnictide families , whereas more recent results from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) @xcite , and transport measurements @xcite revealed afm order with a nel temperature , @xmath21 , as high as 100k .",
    "however , a wide afm transition with an onset around 120k , derived from @xmath0sr @xcite , stays in contrast to the much sharper transition at @xmath22k observed in nmr data @xcite , suggesting a possible sample dependence of the magnetic properties .",
    "only the most recent x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements @xcite could demonstrate the presence of both a second - order structural transition at @xmath23k and a magnetic transition to the long - range stripe - afm phase at @xmath24k on the same single crystal . still , the somewhat lower value of @xmath21 in this sample as compared to those reported for powders of the same compound could indicate that the crystal slightly deviates from the stoichiometric composition .",
    "band structure calculations @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission measurements @xcite reported that the fermi surface of iron - platinum arsenides must be highly two - dimensional and similar to that of the usual fe - based superconductors , suggestive of magnetic excitations peaked at the @xmath25 wave vector .",
    "this has been directly confirmed in a recent neutron diffraction experiment @xcite , which revealed magnetic bragg reflections consistent with a stripe - afm order in the @xmath26 plane with a ferromagnetic alignment of spins along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "moreover , intense and steep magnetic excitations were observed at the @xmath28 propagation vector in the undoped superconducting 10 - 4 - 8 compound by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite , similar to those found in most other pnictides @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in most families of iron arsenides the structural transition occurs at a higher temperature , compared to @xmath21 .",
    "the region between the two transitions in the phase diagram is typically associated with the much discussed spin - nematic state , which breaks the fourfold rotational symmetry while preserving the translational symmetry of the electronic subsystem @xcite .",
    "therefore , compounds with a large difference between @xmath29 and @xmath21 , such as nafeas @xcite , represent perfect candidates for studying this enigmatic electronic phase . in the 10 - 3 - 8 parent compound",
    ", the difference of 1420k between @xmath22k derived from the nmr measurements @xcite and @xmath30k measured directly by x - ray diffraction @xcite , or between @xmath31k and @xmath32k obtained on the same single crystal by neutron diffraction @xcite is unprecedentedly high among all known iron - pnictide compounds , making this system especially promising for experimental investigations of the nematic state .    turning back to the superconducting properties",
    ", we note that superconductivity in the 10 - 3 - 8 compounds can be tuned by substituting platinum @xcite or other transition metals @xcite on the fe site , by trivalent metal doping ( y , la  sm , gd  lu ) on the ca site @xcite , or by applying pressure @xcite . upon pt substitution ,",
    "10 - 3 - 8 compounds remain not superconducting below 3% doping level @xcite , which correlates to the phase diagrams of most other feas superconductors with transition metal substitution on the fe site , where doping suppresses the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state of the parent compound @xcite .",
    "a very similar phase diagram is observed upon the application of hydrostatic pressure to the undoped 10 - 3 - 8 compound @xcite , where pressure - induced superconductivity appears in the 3.57gpa pressure range with maximal @xmath33k at 4.1gpa .",
    "the superconducting dome follows immediately after the afm order is suppressed both in doping and pressure phase diagrams @xcite . upon rare - earth doping ,",
    "superconductivity in the phase diagram appears independently of the type of the dopant element , revealing a universal dependence of @xmath16 on concentration with an optimum around @xmath34 @xcite .    to date",
    ", several essential properties of the superconducting state in 10 - 3 - 8 materials are known . for instance , a large anisotropy of the upper critical fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( parallel and perpendicular to the feas planes ) has been demonstrated @xcite , reaching @xmath37 upon approaching @xmath9 , which makes this compound one of the most two - dimensional among known fe - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "low - temperature coherence lengths are estimated to be @xmath38  and @xmath39  @xcite , comparable to other arsenides @xcite .",
    "the normalized heat capacity jump , @xmath40 , for the la - doped 10 - 3 - 8 compound was reported to be 0.37 ( ref . ) or 0.81 ( ref . ) , well below the weak - coupling prediction of 1.43 resulting from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory .",
    "the in - plane london penetration depth @xmath41 was obtained with a value of approximately 1000  nm @xcite , which is substantially higher than typical values for pnictides @xcite .",
    "the existence of multiple superconducting gaps has been suggested from the temperature dependencies of critical fields and the london penetration depth @xcite , yet no direct spectroscopic measurements of the gap magnitude has so far been obtained , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "there are additional indications that the anisotropy of the superconducting gap increases toward the edges of the superconducting dome as compared to the optimal doping @xcite .",
    "while direct measurements of the superconducting order parameter remain scarce , it has already been suggested that iron - platinum arsenides could share the same pairing mechanism with other iron - based superconductors , mediated by the afm spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a verification of this hypothesis would require the knowledge of the spin - fluctuation spectrum and the order - parameter symmetry in these new compounds , which we address in the present work .",

    "the muon - spin polarization was rotated at 45@xmath45 with respect to the applied field .",
    "the signal was picked up from the left and right pair of detectors .",
    "the measurements were done in the temperature range between 2k and 25k .",
    "first , we performed characterization experiments to exclude the presence of foreign phases .",
    "a measurement at @xmath46k performed in a weak transverse field of 20 g showed no fast - depolarizing fraction of the muon asymmetry to within 10% , thereby excluding any significant amounts of impurity phases with static magnetism ( either ordered or disordered ) in the sample .",
    "as the next step , we verified the absence of any non - superconducting paramagnetic inclusions apart from the main superconducting phase . in the superconducting state , magnetic flux lines penetrate the superconductor in the form of quantized vortices , leading to an inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic field inside the sample , which causes an additional depolarization of the muons .",
    "if the sample is cooled down in an applied magnetic field , due to the large value of the london penetration depth @xcite , the well ordered vortex lattice causes only a slow additional depolarization , comparable to the nuclear contribution . to better",
    "separate these components , we prepared the sample by cooling it down below @xmath16 in zero field and then applying a transverse field of 1000 g , which resulted in a much more disordered vortex distribution and a much faster depolarization rate . at several measured temperatures ,",

    "further , the muon depolarization rate , @xmath48 , has been measured systematically as a function of temperature in a field - cooled experiment . using the result of our previous measurement , at this stage of data analysis we fixed the superconducting volume fraction to 100% and fitted the @xmath0sr signal to the following model : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial asymmetry , @xmath51  mhz / t is the muon gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath52 is the initial phase of the muon spins .",
    "the resulting temperature dependence of the relaxation rate is presented in fig.[fig : musr ] .",
    "it consists of two components : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the constant magnetic nuclear depolarization rate and @xmath55 describes the additional temperature - dependent depolarization due to the vortex lattice in the superconducting state .",

    "parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath64 and @xmath73 were fitted simultaneously , while @xmath9 was kept fixed to the previously determined value .",
    "the two - gap model results in a significantly better fit as compared to a single gap ( see fig.[fig : musr ] ) , which agrees with conclusions of an earlier study performed on 10 - 3 - 8 samples with a similar composition @xcite .",
    "the resulting gap magnitudes , @xmath74mev and @xmath75mev , correspond to the @xmath76 ratios of 3.8 and 0.58 , respectively , which are in good agreement with those of other unconventional two - gap superconductors with similar critical temperatures @xcite . for the larger gap ,",
    "the @xmath76 ratio is only slightly higher than the value of 3.53 predicted by the bcs theory , which puts the ( cafe@xmath1pt@xmath2as)@xmath3pt@xmath4as@xmath5 superconductor in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the london penetration depth of @xmath77 nm , resulting from our fit , is somewhat higher than typical values for iron pnictides @xcite , but nearly twice lower than the value of 1200 nm reported for a pt - doped 10 - 3 - 8 superconductor with a slightly lower @xmath16 of 11k from magnetic force microscopy @xcite .",
    "it is also more consistent with the empirical uemura scaling @xcite , generalized for iron - arsenide superconductors in ref ..    it has to be noted that the model used here to analyze the @xmath0sr data is unaware of the pseudogap revealed in the ins and nmr experiments , as will be described below .",
    "despite the good description of the experimental data , in the prospect of these results we should consider the large energy gap ( @xmath70 ) obtained from the superfluid density just as an effective energy scale related to the superconducting transition , rather than the actual gap in the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "as will be seen from the nmr results , the actual energy gap is both larger in magnitude and opens up at a higher temperature much above @xmath16 .       at 5mev energy transfer for two temperatures : @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , along with their difference shown below ( circles ) .",

    "ins measurements were performed using the triple - axis spectrometer puma ( mlz , garching ) with a fixed final neutron wave vector of @xmath82 .",
    "the low - symmetry triclinic unit cell of the 10 - 3 - 8 compounds , containing 10 fe atoms due to the superstructure of vacancies in the ptas layer , complicates the description of the reciprocal space in the natural crystallographic notation .",
    "therefore , we will use the unfolded brillouin zone ( bz ) notation , which is usually introduced to simplify the description of the reciprocal space in iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the fe sublattice with one fe atom per unit cell , whose symmetry in the 10 - 3 - 8 systems is very close to tetragonal .",
    "indeed , from the high - temperature lattice parameters of the undoped ( cafeas)@xmath3pt@xmath4as@xmath5 ( ref . ) , one obtains the following parameters for the fe sublattice : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 . the minor difference between @xmath89 and @xmath90 and the deviations of the angles from 90@xmath45",
    "can be neglected to a good approximation , resulting in a tetragonal unit cell .",
    "this fact is best illustrated by the recent x - ray diffraction data on the 10 - 3 - 8 parent compound @xcite .     at @xmath91 .",
    "the solid lines in high - temperature datasets are fits to the moriya formula ( see text ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "an additional gaussian peak is added to the fitting function to describe the anomalous peak appearing at 7mev energy transfer . ]    in fig.[fig : transverse ] , we present constant - energy scans through @xmath92 along the transverse direction at two temperatures below and immediately above @xmath16 : 3.5k and 15k .",
    "a well - centered peak originating from the magnetic signal coincides with the same commensurate @xmath93 wave vector vector as in most other iron - arsenide systems @xcite .",
    "however , fe - based superconductors typically exhibit a magnetic resonant mode @xcite , manifested in the transfer of the magnetic spectral weight below the superconducting transition from the low - energy spin - gap region to higher energies immediately under @xmath94 .",
    "the resonance energy scales linearly with @xmath16 , approximately following a simple empirical rule established for a broad class of fe - based systems : @xmath95 ( refs . ) .",
    "for our compound with @xmath6k , it is therefore expected to appear around 5mev , where the scans in fig.[fig : transverse ] were measured .",
    "contrary to this expectation , we observe no change in the ins intensity between the datasets acquired below and above @xmath16 , as best seen in the subtraction of low- and high - temperature data shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse ] .",
    "hence , the magnetic resonant mode in the conventional sense is absent in ( cafe@xmath1pt@xmath2as)@xmath3pt@xmath4as@xmath5 .    to observe the overall shape of the signal and to confirm its magnetic origin , we performed energy scans at the same @xmath96 for several temperatures .",
    "all scans were complemented by background measurements on both sides of the peak , which were averaged and subtracted from the midpoint intensity to obtain the scattering function , @xmath97 .",
    "the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility ( fig.[fig : sqw ] ) was then obtained via the fluctuation - dissipation relation : @xmath98 .",
    "the signal is clearly suppressed towards higher temperatures and its overall shape can be well described by the moriya formula ( solid lines ) , derived for nearly afm metals @xcite , which was previously shown to hold well for the normal - state paramagnetic excitations in fe - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the low - temperature datasets at 3.5k and 15.5k also exhibit an unusual peak centered at @xmath10mev , which can not be attributed to the conventional magnetic resonant mode because it persists almost unchanged above @xmath16 and is located at an energy far above the anticipated onset of the particle - hole continuum ( @xmath99mev , as follows from the analysis of our @xmath0sr data ) .",

    "the signal exhibits a clear anomaly around @xmath13k , associated with an onset of additional intensity at low temperatures . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no phase transition in this temperature range has been announced in the literature for the pt - doped 10 - 3 - 8 compound .",
    "another weak anomaly in the @xmath102-dependence could be suspected at @xmath16 , where the intensity of the 7mev peak appears to be slightly suppressed , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : sqw ] .",
    "if this suppression is confirmed , it could indicate a possible competition of the phenomenon responsible for the 7mev peak with superconductivity .",
    "the sum rule for magnetic neutron scattering , @xmath103 implies that the formation of the 7  mev peak below @xmath15 must be associated with a simultaneous depletion of spectral weight at lower energies , which can be associated with the opening of a pseudogap . within this scenario ,",
    "the peak would represent a precursor resonant mode or a pile - up of magnetic intensity around the pseudogap energy .",
    "this interpretation motivated us to perform nmr measurements on the same sample , which we will present below , substantiating the presence of a pseudogap with comparable magnitude also in the electronic structure .",
    "it is illustrative to compare our ins results with those obtained previously on the related ( cafe@xmath1pt@xmath2as)@xmath3pt@xmath104as@xmath5 compounds with higher values of @xmath16 @xcite . in the 10 - 4 - 8 sample with",

    "a more recent report of the same group on another sample with @xmath107k presents the observation of a similar peak around @xmath1218mev [ fig.2(b ) in ref . ] .",
    "we collected all these results in fig.[fig : scaling2 ] , where we plot the peak energy vs. @xmath16 together with the universal scaling relationship of the neutron resonant mode in 122-type iron pnictides @xcite , shown for comparison .",
    "clearly , the energies of the peaks observed in all three iron - platinum arsenides fall systematically above the @xmath95 line , which could indicate their common origin that is distinct from the usual superconducting resonant mode , but universal among the whole class of materials .     ratios are systematically higher than those expected for the magnetic resonant modes . ]",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance is directly sensitive to changes in the electronic dos in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the opening of small energy gaps can be precisely tracked by measuring the temperature dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , we performed both @xmath109as nmr spectroscopy and @xmath110 relaxation experiments on two pieces of the same single crystal that was used for the ins study described above , with both samples showing consistent behavior . the @xmath109as spectrum shown in fig .",

    "this peak can be rather seen as a consequence of the pseudogap formation , representing a magnetic spectral - weight redistribution by analogy with the spin resonance emerging below @xmath94 in most other iron - based superconductors within the superconducting state .",
    "our estimate of the pseudogap magnitude from nmr is fully consistent with this interpretation , as @xmath144mev ( @xmath119-wave model ) lies immediately above the ins peak seen in fig.[fig : sqw ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath0sr revealed no significant increase in the muon relaxation rate at low temperatures that could signal critical slowing down of spin fluctuations in the proximity to a magnetic instability , as actually expected for an optimally doped sample sufficiently remote from the afm dome in the phase diagram .",
    "this renders the magnetic origin of the pseudogap in our 10 - 3 - 8 sample unlikely .",
    "an alternative scenario of `` preformed pairs '' , which was first put forward ( among others ) to explain the pseudogap in high-@xmath16 cuprates @xcite , or a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) kind of transition expected in low - dimensional systems @xcite , seems to be much more consistent with the presented results . in these scenarios ,",
    "the formation of phase - incoherent cooper pairs occurs already above @xmath16 , leading to a depletion of the dos at the fermi level on an energy scale comparable with the superconducting gap . in our case",
    ", this condition is fulfilled , because the ratio @xmath145 ( @xmath119-wave model ) is rather close to the coupling constant of 1.76 predicted by the bcs theory . moreover ,",
    "our estimate for @xmath13k is not too far from the maximal @xmath16 of @xmath14635k among iron - platinum arsenides @xcite .",
    "the preformed - pairing mechanism can also naturally explain the absence of an additional anomaly from the superconducting gap opening at @xmath16 in our nmr data , as the common origin of the two gaps implies that the large gap is fully open already above @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , the smaller gap , which could either reside on one of the fe@xmath147 bands near the @xmath148 point @xcite or be induced by the proximity effect on the pt@xmath147 fermi surfaces @xcite , forms only below @xmath16 , resulting in a hebel - slichter anomaly around 2k .",
    "coexistence of such a peak with a resonance - like feature in the ins data is highly unusual among fe - pnictides and could speak in favor of a difference in symmetry between the larger and smaller gaps .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath14 relaxation - rate measurements probing the dos at the fermi level , ac susceptibility [ fig .  [",
    "fig : magnetization](b ) ] and @xmath0sr [ fig .",
    "[ fig : musr ] ] experiments are sensitive to the superfluid density , i.e. only to the phase - coherent fraction of cooper pairs that underwent bose - einstein condensation below @xmath16 .",
    "this explains why both measurements are insensitive to the pseudogap opening and display conventional behavior .    in summary",
    ", our results point toward possible preformed cooper pairing in platinum - iron arsenides , leading to a pseudogap formation below @xmath15 on parts of the fermi surface responsible for @xmath445060% of the dos , which becomes fully open upon reaching @xmath16 . below @xmath16 ,",
    "the pairs gain phase coherence and form a superconducting condensate , as can be seen in the diamagnetic response and in the sharp increase of the superfluid density .",
    "simultaneously , a second ( smaller ) superconducting gap is induced on the remaining parts of the fermi surface .",
    "quantitative assessment of all the mentioned gaps and transition temperatures has been presented .",
    "the spin - fluctuation spectrum responds to the pseudogap formation by a partial redistribution of the low - energy spectral weight , leading to a pile - up of magnetic intensity around 7  mev that resembles a precursor magnetic resonant mode .",

    "<S> using a combination of muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , we investigated the novel iron - based superconductor with a triclinic crystal structure ( cafe@xmath1pt@xmath2as)@xmath3pt@xmath4as@xmath5 ( @xmath6k ) , containing platinum - arsenide intermediary layers . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the superfluid density obtained from the @xmath0sr relaxation - rate measurements indicates the presence of two superconducting gaps , @xmath7 . according to our ins measurements , </S>",
    "<S> commensurate spin fluctuations are centered at the @xmath8 wave vector , like in most other iron arsenides . </S>",
    "<S> their intensity remains unchanged across @xmath9 , indicating the absence of a spin resonance typical for many fe - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we observed a peak in the spin - excitation spectrum around @xmath10mev at the same wave vector , which persists above @xmath9 and is characterized by the ratio @xmath11 , which is significantly higher than typical values for the magnetic resonant modes in iron pnictides ( @xmath124.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of magnetic intensity at 7mev revealed an anomaly around @xmath13k related to the disappearance of this new mode . </S>",
    "<S> a suppression of the spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath14 , observed by nmr immediately below @xmath15 without any notable subsequent anomaly at @xmath16 , indicates that @xmath15 could mark the onset of a pseudogap in ( cafe@xmath1pt@xmath2as)@xmath3pt@xmath4as@xmath5 , which is likely associated with the emergence of preformed cooper pairs . </S>"
