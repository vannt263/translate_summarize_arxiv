    "laboratory experiments @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite and atmospheric observations @xcite revealed small - scale long - living inhomogeneities ( clusters ) in spatial distribution of particles in different turbulent flows . the origin of these inhomogeneities is not always clear but their influence on particle transport and mixing can be hardly overestimated . in particular , turbulence causes formation of small - scale droplet inhomogeneities , increases the relative droplet velocity and affects the hydrodynamic droplet interactions .",
    "all these effects can enhance the rate of droplet collisions ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that atmospheric clouds are regions with strong turbulence , and the turbulence effects are of a great importance for understanding of rain formation in atmospheric clouds , e.g. , these effects can cause the droplet spectrum broadening and acceleration of raindrop formation @xcite .",
    "different kinds of particle clustering , i.e. , the preferential concentration of inertial particles have been studied in a number of numerical simulations @xcite , laboratory experiments ( see review @xcite and @xcite ) and analytical investigations @xcite .    inertial clustering in isothermal and nearly isotropic turbulence with the reynolds numbers @xmath4 produced by fans at the corners of the box has been observed in laboratory experiments @xcite with hollow glass spheres with a mean diameter of @xmath5 m in air . here",
    "@xmath6 is the characteristic turbulent velocity in the maximum scale of turbulent motions @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the kinematic viscosity . the three - dimensional radial distribution function ( rdf ) as a statistical measure of clustering , has been determined from the particle position field using three - dimensional digital holographic particle imaging .",
    "these experiments reveled inertial particle clustering at the dissipation scales . the detailed comparisons between experiments and direct numerical simulations of inertial particle clustering in @xcite have demonstrated a good agreement .",
    "the quantitative measurements of inertial clustering have been also performed in @xcite . in particular , the two - dimensional rdf of particles suspended in a turbulence flow with the reynolds numbers @xmath9 has been measured in @xcite by shining a laser sheet at the particles ( the glass particles with the sizes @xmath10 m and @xmath11 m , the lycopodium particles with the size @xmath12 m ) , whereby particle locations have been determined by a ccd camera .",
    "the experiments have been conducted in the spherical turbulence chamber with eight synthetic jet actuators which create homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with no mean flow at the center of the chamber .",
    "the experiments conducted in @xcite have shown that the inertial clustering is most effective for particles with stokes numbers near unity and the size of the clusters is of the order of ten kolmogorov length scales .",
    "a one - dimensional rdf has been measured in @xcite by sampling droplet arrivals at a fixed volume in a wind tunnel , whereby the arrival statistics of water droplets with the mean size @xmath13 m in turbulence with the reynolds numbers @xmath14 has been used to determine the one - dimensional rdf . in the experiments described in @xcite a phase doppler interferometer downstream of the active grid and a spray system have been used , and strong inertial clustering has been observed .",
    "remarkably , the similar experimental findings have been reported in @xcite using completely different experimental set - ups .",
    "the mechanism of inertial clustering of particles in isothermal turbulence is as follows @xcite .",
    "the particles inside the turbulent eddies are carried out to the boundary regions between the eddies by the inertial forces .",
    "this mechanism of the inertial clustering acts in all scales of turbulence , and is more pronounced in small scales .    the goal of this study is to investigate experimentally and theoretically a new type of particle clustering , namely tangling clustering of inertial particles in stably stratified turbulence with imposed mean vertical temperature gradient . in experimental study of particle clustering",
    "we use particle image velocimetry to determine the turbulent velocity field , an image processing technique to determine the spatial distribution of particles , and a specially designed temperature probe with twelve sensitive thermocouples for measurements of the temperature field .",
    "the clustering described in our study is found for inertial particles with small stokes numbers and with material density that is much larger than the fluid density .    in the stratified turbulence a spatial distribution of the mean particle number density is nonuniform due to phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion @xcite .",
    "in particular , the inertial particles are accumulated in the vicinity of the minimum of the mean temperature of the surrounding fluid , which causes formation a non - zero gradient of the mean particle number density , @xmath0 .",
    "the phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion has been predicted theoretically in @xcite , detected in the laboratory experiments in stably and unstably stratified turbulent flows in @xcite and observed in atmospheric turbulence in @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the particle number density can be generated by tangling of the gradient , @xmath0 , of the mean particle number density by velocity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the imposed mean temperature gradient , @xmath1 , results in generation of the anisotropic temperature fluctuations by tangling of this large - scale gradient , @xmath1 , by velocity fluctuations .",
    "these temperature fluctuations may contribute to the two - point correlation function of the divergence of the particle velocity field .",
    "the latter enhances the rate of formation of particle clusters in small scales by the tangling mechanism .",
    "the tangling mechanism is universal and independent of the way of generation of turbulence for large reynolds numbers .",
    "for instance , tangling of the gradient of the large - scale velocity shear produces anisotropic velocity fluctuations @xcite which are responsible for different phenomena : formation of large - scale coherent structures in a turbulent convection @xcite , excitation of the large - scale inertial waves in a rotating inhomogeneous turbulence @xcite , generation of large - scale vorticity @xcite and large - scale magnetic field @xcite in a sheared turbulence .",
