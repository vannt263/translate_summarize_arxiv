    "is usually called the dimensionless free energy , with the notation @xmath23 , but from a rigorous point of view those systems are usually treated in the grand - canonical ensemble ( one sums over all spin configurations , particle occupations , etc . ) , with the grand potential as the generating functional . here , we will consider a specific class of continuous fluid systems , which exhibit at any temperature the universal finite - size behaviour of type ( [ 1.1 ] ) in both grand - canonical ( fixed fugacity , the grand potential ) and canonical ( fixed particle number density , the helmholtz free energy ) ensembles .",
    "although the two ensembles give the same thermodynamic behaviour in the thermodynamic limit , their finite - size corrections are expected to differ from one another . however , as will be documented in this work , at least for the sphere geometry of the confining manifold , the universal finite - size correction term is the same in both ensembles .",
    "the fluids under consideration are the 2d coulomb plasmas of charged particles , interacting through a _ long - range _ logarithmic potential .",
    "the one - component version ( ocp ) of equally , say unit , charged point particles in a uniform neutralizing background is formally related to the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the model is exactly solvable at the inverse temperature @xmath24 @xcite by mapping onto free fermions .",
    "the symmetric two - component version ( tcp ) of oppositely @xmath25 charged pointlike particles undergoes the collapse of positive - negative pairs of charges at @xmath24 , which corresponds to the exactly solvable free - fermion point of the equivalent thirring model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "if a small hard core is attached to the particles in order to prevent the collapse , the 2d tcp ( or coulomb gas ) undergoes the famous kosterlitz - thouless ( k - t ) transition @xcite from a high - temperature conducting phase to a low - temperature insulating phase at around @xmath26 .",
    "the long - range tail of the coulomb potential induces screening . due to the screening effect ,",
    "the bulk charge - charge correlations are short - ranged , exponential or even gaussian . on the other hand",
    ", the same screening effect causes that the induced electrical - field correlations are long - ranged @xcite , @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the free energy of the 2d ocp and the grand potential of the symmetric 2d tcp are supposed to exhibit , at any temperature of the conducting regime , a universal finite - size correction of type ( [ 1.1 ] ) ; this correction is opposite to the one occurring in the massless gaussian field theory @xcite ) which has @xmath27 .",
    "the arguments for a critical - like behaviour were first given for coulomb gases with periodic boundary conditions @xcite , then for coulomb gases confined to a domain by plain hard walls @xcite , by ideal - conductor boundaries @xcite , and finally by ideal - dielectric boundaries @xcite , @xcite . in all cases , the explicit checks of the predicted finite - size universal behaviour were done at the exactly solvable inverse temperature @xmath28 for both ocp and tcp with various geometries of confining domains .    the general derivations of the universal finite - size correction term in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite were based on plausible , but not rigorously justified , heuristic arguments .",
    "very recently , a direct derivation was made for the specific case of coulomb systems living on the surface of a sphere [ where , since there is no boundary , @xmath29 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) ] . by combining the method of stereographic projection of the sphere onto an infinite plane with linear response theory ( tcp , ref .",

    "@xcite ) , the prefactor to the universal @xmath14 correction term was related to the second moment of the short - range part of the density - density direct correlation function @xmath30 for the planar system . this second moment , representing a new sum rule for the corresponding density correlation function ,",
    "was evaluated explicitly for both ocp @xcite and tcp @xcite by using a renormalized mayer expansion @xcite , @xcite , namely by observing a remarkable `` cancelation property '' of specific families of renormalized @xmath30-diagrams .",
    "the obtained results confirm quantitatively the prediction of conformal invariance ( [ 1.1 ] ) for a critical system as we had @xmath31 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study a more general asymmetric 2d coulomb gas made up of two species of pointlike particles with positive and negative charges of arbitrary strengths @xmath32 @xmath33 . without any loss of generality",
    ", we can choose @xmath34 with @xmath35 a positive integer .",
    "the model interpolates between the symmetric tcp @xmath36 and the ocp , obtained as the limiting @xmath4 case after subtracting the kinetic energy of the 2-species . for the asymmetric coulomb gas confined to a sphere , by combining the method of stereographic projection @xcite",
    ", @xcite with the technique of the renormalized mayer expansion @xcite-@xcite we prove that the prefactor to the universal @xmath14-term in ( [ 1.1 ] ) does not depend on the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the same universal term is obtained in both canonical ( free energy ) and grand - canonical ( grand potential ) ensembles , although in the previous studies of coulomb systems the choice of the ensemble seemed to be relevant : the exact solution at @xmath28 and finite - size corrections were obtained strictly in the canonical ensemble for the ocp and in the grand - canonical ensemble for the tcp .    from a technical point of view , the asymmetry in the strength of particle charges induces an asymmetry in particle correlations : two independent two - particle combinations @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the symmetric tcp are replaced by the three ones @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath38 .",
    "the method of stereographic projection @xcite , @xcite is shown to imply a new `` missing '' interrelation among the second moments of species pair correlations .",
    "this , together with a generalization of the `` cancelation '' phenomena in the renormalized mayer expansion , helps us to extend new sum rules for the plane ocp @xcite and symmetric tcp @xcite to the general asymmetric plasma and thus to find the prefactor to the universal finite - size correction for the latter model .    in their pioneering work about",
    "the asymmetric 2d coulomb gas @xcite , the authors predicted a successive series of temperatures at which partial recombinations ( or collapses ) of positive - negative pairs of charges occur , with a consequent impact on the short - distance behaviour of like - species correlations and on the equation of state ( discontinuities of @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the pressure , were suggested ) .",
    "however , the exact solutions of thermodynamics for the symmetric @xmath3 @xcite and the first asymmetric @xmath43 @xcite cases give only one singularity for the pressure at one collapse temperature , related to a short - distance instability of the configuration integral for a neutral cluster formed of one particle of species 1 and @xmath5 particles of species 2 . the collapse temperature is explicitly derived for any @xmath5 in this work .",
    "if one attach a hard - core @xmath44 to the particles , the system remains stable also below the collapse temperature , and can reach the k - t phase transition . in the limit of vanishing @xmath44 , the presence of the k - t transition in the symmetric tcp is indicated by a divergence of the second moment of truncated density - density correlations @xcite .",
    "having at disposal the generalization of this second moment sum rule , we suggest the position of the k - t transition temperature for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the method of stereographic projection in the grand - canonical @xcite and canonical @xcite ensembles is briefly generalized to the asymmetric 2d coulomb gas in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
