    "in recent years high resolution measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have measured the cmb power spectrum beyond the first acoustic peak .",
    "more recently the all - sky wmap results represent a new step towards high precision cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "when combining these measurements with large - scale structure data and distant supernovae an increasingly consistent picture of the universe arises .    in order to investigate cosmological parameters in detail",
    "the experiments themselves have to be thoroughly understood .",
    "cmb anisotropy experiments are essentially of two kinds .",
    "high frequency experiments use bolometers and are usually balloon - born .",
    "the calibration , pointing and beam shape are the main sources of uncertainty of such instruments and tend to smear features in the power spectrum .",
    "low frequency experiments use interferometers and direct;y measure the cmb in fourier space .",
    "the calibration of such instruments is usually well understood and they do not suffer from beam uncertainty but the band - powers inferred from the observations tend to be anti - correlated .",
    "this can lead to increased contrast in the bands and is usually well encoded in the correlation matrix of the band - powers .",
    "this work is an extension to a previous project presented in @xcite .",
    "we use our previously obtained results as an input to a markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) program to estimate the shape of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum using a phenomenological curve .",
    "we use the wmap data along with other cmb data separated in three subsets according to the type of experiment .",
    "in recent cosmological parameter estimations based on cmb data ( see @xcite and references therein ) it has been shown that the simplest theoretical models based on @xmath1 fundamental parameters are sufficient to describe the universe from currently available data .",
    "common assumptions are a flat universe in which adiabatic initial perturbations evolve with no contribution from background gravity waves or massive neutrinos .    with the recently released wmap data a more complicated cosmological picture can be tested @xcite including a varying spectral index , an equation of state of dark energy etc .",
    "it is has now become common to test a parameter space of @xmath2 dimensions or more .",
    "the shape of the cmb power spectrum allowed in such analyses is limited by physical models .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate what model - independent shape is preferred by the data in order to test the influence of experimental systematics which might not be fully under control .    in this analysis ,",
    "we parametrise the cmb power spectrum using a sum of five consecutive gaussians @xmath3 we then use an mcmc routine to constrain the fifteen parameters of our phenomenological curve ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "mcmc is an iterative process . after a certain burn - in time during which the markov chains reach equilibrium ,",
    "the parameters are sampled such that their number density is proportional to their posterior distribution .",
    "as explained in @xcite such a routine is sensitive to the prior probability assumed for the parameters .",
    "its efficiency also depends on the sampling strategy . if degeneracies exist among parameters it is useful to sample along degeneracy directions .",
    "we make use of previously obtained results as an input to our mcmc routine for both the prior and the sampling strategy .",
    "we assume our previous results represent a @xmath7-dimensional gaussian which we use a prior .",
    "for the sampling strategy , we diagonalise the covariance matrices obtained from our analysis before the wmap data release .",
    "we then sample the parameter space as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the parameters of our gaussians , @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath11 are the previously obtained best - fit values of those parameters , @xmath12 are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices , @xmath13 is the matrix of eigenvectors and @xmath14 are sampled from a gaussian of mean zero and unit variance .",
    "this is equivalent to following the axes of our gaussian prior .",
    "we further check that the samples are within the previously assumed priors .",
    "we then run our mcmc code for three subsets of data .",
    "we first separate high ( hf ) and low frequency ( lf ) data as listed in table [ cmbdata ] and then combine them .",
    "we always use the wmap data .",
    "for each sample we calculate the phenomenological power spectrum and return its likelihood to the mcmc routine .",
    "the wmap likelihood is calculated using the method described in @xcite . for the other data the likelihood for a given phenomenological model",
    "is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gaussian curvature of the likelihood matrix at the peak .",
    "when available we use the lognormal approximation to the band - powers .",
    "we marginalize over the reported gaussian distributed calibration error for each experiment and we include the beam uncertainties by the analytical marginalization method presented in @xcite .",
    ".[cmbdata]list of experimental data used in this study .",
    "we use low and high frequency experiments both separately and together . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to get the shape of the power spectrum we divide the @xmath17 - @xmath18 space into pixels of size @xmath19 , @xmath20 and count the number of phenomenological spectra that go through each pixel .",
    "the resulting allowed shapes are shown in figure [ tsunami ] along with pre - wmap results .",
    "this confirms the consistency and accuracy of the constraints obtained on the first two peaks . at smaller angular scales , as we had obtained before , the discrepancy remains between high and low frequency experiments .",
    "even if we include correlations and marginalise over calibration and beam uncertainties in the data the high frequency data show less contrasted features in the power spectrum than low frequency experiments .",
    "in particular the third peak is higher than the second peak for low frequency experiments .",
    "this has important consequences in terms of the estimate of cold dark matter in the universe as shown in figure [ cosmopars ] .",
    "the yellow region in figure [ cosmopars ] which corresponds to the low frequency experiments intersects the orange regions for higher values of the cdm physical density than from the wmap parameter estimation ( vertical gray region ) .",
    "the ratio of the first to the third peak from high - frequency data allows for a lower cdm density owing to the less marked secondary features in the power spectrum .",

    "our best fit shapes are not physical but the main observables of the spectrum are consistent with the wmap cosmological parameter estimations .",
    "further investigation of the experiment - related discrepancies would be useful and wmap provides a strong starting point . in combination with higher multipole data the shape of the cmb power spectrum is now strongly constrained .",
    "there is no doubt that a second and third peaks have been detected .",
    "this illustrates the new era cosmology has entered : the question now is not whether secondary peaks are present , thereby strengthening the already compelling agreement with inflationary predictions but how strong those secondary features are .",
