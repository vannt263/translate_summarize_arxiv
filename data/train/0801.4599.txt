    "brownian heat engine functions as transducer of thermal energy into mechanical work .",
    "it rectifies thermal fluctuations into a unidirectional current as long as the system is out of equilibrium . in the last few decades ,",
    "the study of such a tiny engine has got considerable attention not only for the construction of a miniaturized engine that can help us to utilize energy resources at microscopic scales @xcite but also for better understanding of the nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic property of brownian heat engine has been explored intensively by considering different model systems .",
    "brownian heat engine working due to spatially - variable temperature is one of the model systems which has been studied in the pioneering works by bttiker @xcite , van kampen @xcite , and landauer @xcite . after the work of bttiker",
    ", the ratchet model has been the subject of several authors @xcite .",
    "recently , we considered an exactly solvable model of the heat engine and investigated the conditions under which the model works as a heat engine , as a refrigerator and as neither of the two @xcite .",
    "not only we exposed the energetics of such an engine at a quasistatic limit but we also found the thermodynamic properties of the engine when it operates at a finite time .    in modeling of brownian heat engine , one crucial but unexplored issue is the way how to maximize the velocity , the efficiency and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator . for instance , in construction of artificial brownian motors , one may need to design an engine that accomplishes its task as fast as possible and efficiently .",
    "the brownian heat engine operates autonomously @xcite .",
    "the performance of this engine ( how fast and efficiently can it achieve its task ? ) relies upon the way how the ingredients of the system are arranged prior to the engine operation .",
    "the purpose of this theoretical work is to present one possible way of improving the performance of the heat engine .",
    "earlier , the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) of a brownian particle that walks over rugged sawtooth potential was studied by us @xcite and in the work @xcite using super symmetric potential approach and using properties of random walk on networks formulated by goldhirch and gefen @xcite .",
    "the sawtooth potential was systematically subdivided into series of barriers without altering the barrier height , the potential width and the area under the barrier .",
    "the theoretical works revealed the existence of an optimal barrier subdivision that minimizes the mfpt . in this work ,",
    "we use similar approach and study the effect of subdividing the ratchet potential on the performance of the engine .",
    "we show that the velocity , the efficiency and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator tend to increase as the ratchet potential is subdivided into series of barriers .    unlike macroscopic heat engines , the carnot efficiency is unattainable for brownian heat engines when the engines work quasistatically because of the irreversible heat flow via the kinetic energy @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we obtain a simple analytic expression for the efficiency at quasistatic limit .",
    "the analytic result reveals that the efficiency of the engine never goes to the carnot efficiency at quasistatic limit .",
    "another important but unexplored issue is the influence of the heat flow via the kinetic energy on the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator . in the present work ,",
    "we analytically show that the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is always less than the carnot refrigerator when the engine operates quasistatically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the model . in section iii , we study the dependence of the efficiency and the velocity on the model parameters in the absence of external force . we show that the velocity and the efficiency attain optimum values at a particular value of barrier subdivision @xmath0 . at qausistatic limit",
    ", the efficiency never goes to carnot efficiency for any @xmath0 as the heat transfer via the kinetic energy is irreversible . in section iv , we consider the model in the presence of external load .",
    "we find that the velocity , the efficiency and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator attain maximum values when the sawtooth potential is subdivided into series of smaller connected barrier series .",
    "we also show that the efficiency of the engine never approaches the carnot efficiency and , the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is always less than the carnot refrigerator at quasistatic limit .",
    "section v deals with summary and conclusion .",
    "consider a brownian particle which walks in a viscous medium in a periodic sawtooth potential whose potential profile ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is described by @xmath1,&if $ -l_{0 } < x \\le 0$;\\cr     u_{0}[{-x\\over l_{0}}+1],&if $ 0 < x \\le l_{0};$\\cr     } \\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the barrier height and the width of the sawtooth potential , respectively .",
    "the viscous medium is alternatively in contact with the hot @xmath4 and the cold @xmath5 reservoirs along the reaction coordinate as shown in fig .",
    "1 . using the same theoretical frame work @xcite , the sawtooth potential is subdivided into series of smaller connected barrier series .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2 shows the left and the right sides of the sawtooth potential shown in fig .",
    "1 are subdivided into three small steps @xmath6 .",
    "for single barrier step between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for simplicity , we choose @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 . in general , for @xmath0 equally spaced intervals , from the top of the barrier to either side , @xmath3 and @xmath2 are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "such parameterization is physically reasonable as the barrier height , the barrier width and the area under the barrier remain approximately constant as @xmath0 is varied @xcite .",
    "the brownian particle attains a directional motion when it is exposed to the potential coupled with spatially variable temperature .",
    "for such a system , the general expression for the steady state current @xmath14 for the brownian particle _ in any periodic potential _ with or without load is reported in the work @xcite . the closed form expression for the steady state current @xmath14",
    "( please refer appendix a , ref .",
    "@xcite ) is given by @xmath15 the drift velocity @xmath16 of the particle is associated to the steady state current @xmath14 and it is given by @xmath17 .    the hot reservoir is the ultimate source of energy for the engine .",
    "when the engine works as a heat engine , the net flux of the particle is from hot to the cold heat baths .",
    "hence when the particle moves from the hot to the cold heat baths , for any @xmath0 , the particle takes @xmath18 amount of energy from the hot reservoir to surmount the potential of magnitude @xmath2 and to overcome the viscous drag force @xmath19 as well as the external force of amount @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath21 amount of energy is transferred from the hot to the cold heat baths via kinetic energy @xcite when the particle walks from the hot to the cold heat baths .",
    "hence the brownian particle takes @xmath22 amount of heat from the hot reservoir . the heat flow to the cold reservoir",
    "is given by @xmath23 when the engine acts as refrigerator , the net flow of the particle is from the cold to the hot reservoirs . note that , due to the particle recrossing between the hot and the cold reservoirs , heat is leaking from the hot to the cold reservoir of magnitude @xmath24 .",
    "this is in opposite direction to the heat being taken out of the cold reservoir .",
    "hence , this quantity contributes as negative to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the net heat flow out of the cold reservoir is given by @xmath26 .",
    "not all motors are designed to pull loads and alternative proposals for efficiency depend on the task each motor performs .",
    "some motors may have to achieve high velocity against a frictional drag .",
    "this basically implies that the objective of the motor is to move a certain distance in a given time interval . for such motors ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the useful work is the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 . for motors designed to pull loads @xmath31 ,",
    "the useful work is given by @xmath32 .",
    "the efficiency @xmath33 and the coefficient of performance ( cop ) of the refrigerator @xmath34 of the engine is given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the purpose of this theoretical work , for given parameter values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to find the velocity , @xmath16 , the efficiency , @xmath33 , and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator , @xmath37 , for various values of barrier subdivision , @xmath0 .",
    "next , the energetics of the brownian heat engine will be explored as a function of model parameters both in the absence and in the presence of external force .",
    "in the absence of the external force @xmath27 , the analytically obtained steady state current for @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the coefficient of friction of the brownian particle .",
    "the magnitude of the coefficient of friction of the brownian particle @xmath40 depends on temperature of the viscous medium . as approximation ,",
    "it is considered to be a constant . in appendixes",
    "a and b , the expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given for @xmath45 and @xmath6 , respectively . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are lengthy and will not be presented in this work .",
    "when one omits the heat exchange via kinetic energy ( neglecting the term @xmath21 in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) , the efficiency goes to carnot efficiency @xmath47 at quasistatic limit .",
    "the quasistatic limit of the engine is obtained when @xmath2 goes to zero . for any @xmath0",
    ", we explore the efficiency at quasistatic limit and find that @xmath48 which is exactly equal to the efficiency of the carnot engine .",
    "the heat flow via the kinetic energy significantly affects the efficiency of the brownian heat engines .",
    "next , considering the heat flow via the potential and the kinetic energies , we explore the thermodynamic property of the engine .",
    "let us introduce dimensionless parameters before exploring the dependence of the velocity and the efficiency on different values of barrier subdivision @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce scaled parameters : scaled length @xmath49 , scaled barrier height @xmath50 , scaled current @xmath51 where @xmath52 , scaled velocity @xmath53 and scaled temperature @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes boltzmann s constant . for simplicity ,",
    "it is considered to be unity .",
    "we also introduce dimensionless parameters @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath0 ) where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the efficiencies when @xmath61 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the steady state current or equivalently the drift velocity on the potential @xmath62 can be analyzed by exploiting the analytically obtained steady state current ( for instance , see eq .",
    "( 5 ) for the case @xmath38 and , the expressions shown in the appendixes a and b for the cases @xmath45 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the directional current is the result of spatial temperature difference along the ratchet potential . in the absence of the ratchet potential ,",
    "the average velocity of the particle is zero , i.e. ; the velocity @xmath16 vanishes when @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in the limit @xmath64 , @xmath65",
    "as the particle encounters a difficulty of jumping the high potential barrier of the ratchet potential , see fig .",
    "3 . the velocity @xmath16 attains maximum value at a particular value of @xmath62 .",
    "note that the engine operates with maximum power at this particular value of @xmath62 .",
    "the potential @xmath62 , at which the velocity of the particle is maximum , shifts to wards the right as the number of barrier subdivisions increase as it can be readily seen in fig .",
    "3 . note that in the system we consider , the left and the right sides of the sawtooth potential are coupled with the hot and the cold baths , respectively .",
    "for such a system , positive velocity exhibits that the net flux of the particle is from the hot to the cold reservoirs and the engine operates only as a heat engine .",
    "figure 3 shows that the velocity is positive for any @xmath0 .    for high potential barriers , the brownian",
    "particle encounters a difficulty of jumping the sawtooth potential when the background temperature is weak .",
    "subdividing the barrier along the reaction coordinates enables the brownian particle to cross each small barrier with small thermal kicks and ultimately the particle crosses the high potential barrier within short period of time than the time taken by the particle when it crosses the smooth potential barrier . hence subdividing the sawtooth potential enhances the drift velocity @xmath16 as depicted in fig .",
    "the possibility of enhancing the escape rate of a brownian particle over sawtooth potential under specific conditions was envisaged @xcite .",
    "the analytical finding revealed that the escape rate of the brownian particle is enhanced for subdivided reaction coordinate which qualitatively agrees with this work .",
    "the analytically determined efficiency @xmath33 is plotted as a function of @xmath62 in fig . 4 for the case @xmath38 . when one considers the heat flow via the potential energy , in the limit @xmath63 , @xmath66 which is equal to the carnot efficiency for parameter values of @xmath67=2 and @xmath68=@xmath69 . on the other",
    "when we consider the heat flow both via the potential and the kinetic energies , @xmath70 when @xmath63 and @xmath71 .",
    "this exhibits that quasistatic process may not be the best working condition for the brownian heat engines which agrees with the claim of hondou and sekimoto @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath72 attains a maximum value at finite value of @xmath62 .",
    "the same figure depicts that @xmath73 and @xmath74 when @xmath71 .",
    "the plot of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath62 is displayed in fig .",
    "the enhancement in the efficiency is high when @xmath67 is small . for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78, ... @xmath79 .",
    "this implies @xmath80 is the optimal value of barrier subdivision , at which the efficiency ( velocity ) is maximum , for a given parameter values .",
    "note that the optimal barrier subdivision @xmath81 is sensitive to the choices of model parameters .",
    "for instance when @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the optimal value of barrier subdivision .",
    "the net flux of the particle strictly depends on the temperature difference between the hot and the cold baths . in the limit @xmath84 ( since @xmath85 , the system is in thermal equilibrium ) , the steady state current @xmath86 vanishes , i.e. ; @xmath65 ( see eq . ( 5 ) for the case @xmath38 and the expressions shown in the appendixes a and b for the cases @xmath45 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the unidirectional current @xmath86 is due to the non homogenous temperature profile along the ratchet potential as the particle in the hot bath can easily crosses the potential barrier of the sawtooth potential than the particle in the cold bath .",
    "when the magnitude of the rescaled temperature @xmath67 steps up , the tendency of the particle in the hot bath to reach the top of the ratchet potential hill increases than the particle in the cold reservoir .",
    "this leads to an increase in the current @xmath86 or the drift velocity @xmath16 as shown in fig .",
    "the same figure shows that the net flux of the particle intensifies with @xmath0 .",
    "the plot of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath67 is displayed in fig .",
    "significant enhancement of the efficiency is observed when @xmath67 is small .",
    "in the presence of external force , the net flow of the particle depends on the magnitude of the external force . for large load ,",
    "current reversal may occur and this indicates that the engine operates not only as a heat engine but also as a refrigerator . in the presence of constant external force @xmath20 , similar to the previous section , the closed form expression for steady state is given by @xmath87 for @xmath38 , the expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given by @xmath88 on the other hand , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 here @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath93 are lengthy and will not be presented in this work .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath16 is related to the steady state current and it is given by @xmath94 .",
    "introducing additional rescaled parameter : @xmath95 , we study how the velocity , the efficiency and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator behave as @xmath0 varies .",
    "figure 8 presents the plot of the velocity @xmath16 versus rescaled load @xmath96 for @xmath38 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . as shown in the figure for @xmath99 ,",
    "the load is not strong enough to reverse the direction of the net flux of the particle , i.e. , the net flow of the particle is from the hot to the cold reservoirs and hence the model works as a heat engine . on other hand for @xmath100 , the current becomes negative and the model acts as a refrigerator .",
    "the particle velocity is zero at @xmath101 . in general , for any number of barrier subdivisions @xmath0 the velocity @xmath102 , when the load is @xmath103 when one omits the heat exchange via kinetic energy ( neglecting the term @xmath21 in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) , for any @xmath0 , in the quasistatic limit @xmath104 , the efficiency is equal to carnot efficiency : @xmath105 and in the quasistatic limit @xmath106 , the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is equal to carnot refrigerator : @xmath107 we further investigate the thermodynamic property of the engine by including the heat exchange via the kinetic and the potential energies . at a quasistatic limit , for any @xmath0 , the efficiency takes a simple form : @xmath108 where @xmath109 note that @xmath110 when @xmath111 .",

    "<S> we discuss the effect of subdividing the ratchet potential on the performance of a tiny brownian heat engine that is modeled as a brownian particle hopping in a viscous medium in a sawtooth potential ( with or without load ) assisted by alternately placed hot and cold heat baths along its path . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the velocity , the efficiency and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator maximize when the sawtooth potential is subdivided into series of smaller connected barrier series . </S>",
    "<S> when the engine operates quasistatically , we analytically show that the efficiency of the engine can not approach the carnot efficiency and , the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is always less than the carnot refrigerator due to the irreversible heat flow via the kinetic energy . </S>"
