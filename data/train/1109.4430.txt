    "locality in the fukaya category of an exact symplectic manifold , and the relation of this structure to sheaf theory , has been studied in works of abouzaid @xcite , abouzaid - seidel @xcite , kontsevich @xcite , seidel @xcite , and , with sibilla , the authors @xcite ; and in unpublished works of tamarkin , nadler , and nadler - tanaka .",
    "a common thread is to identify a singular lagrangian `` skeleton , '' and then relate the fukaya category to the combinatorial structure of how this skeleton is built from smooth parts , as described by quivers or constructible sheaves .",
    "typically , these skeleta are constructed from a choice of some additional structure placed on the exact symplectic manifold ( e.g. , stein , liouville , weinstein , morse ) , though the fukaya category itself should be independent of such choices .",
    "we wish to apply these ideas to kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry conjecture ( hms ) . in this note",
    "we describe an approach to the hms for a certain class of toric hypersurfaces considered by batyrev and borisov .",
    "locality , skeleta , and constructible sheaves appear at the large complex structure / large volume limits of these families of hypersurfaces .",

    "we review the constructions of @xmath9 and @xmath11 in section [ sec : rpams ] .",
    "we have the following variant of conjecture [ conj : hms1 ] , proposed by seidel @xcite :    [ conj : hms2 ] there is an equivalence of categories @xmath13 where the rhs denotes the fukaya category of compact lagrangian branes in @xmath11 .    in this paper , in sections",
    "[ sec : skeleta ] and [ sec : stackyfan ] , we define a topological space @xmath2 which `` could be '' a lagrangian skeleton of @xmath11 . the space @xmath2 is a legendrian submanifold of a contact boundary of the cotangent bundle of a compact torus . the technology of kashiwara and schapira , reviewed in section [ sec : microlocal ] , allows us to equip @xmath2 with a sheaf of dg categories .",
    "we conjecture that this sheaf of categories is equivalent to the sheaf of fukaya categories on the skeleton of @xmath11 . in forthcoming work with sibilla @xcite",

    "if our conjecture is accurate , this would establish hms at the lcl / lvl limits for a large class of toric hypersurfaces .",
    "a subconjecture is that @xmath2 is homotopy equivalent to the hypersurface @xmath14 as evidence for this , we study the leray spectral sequence of a map @xmath15 , which we conjecture degenerates at @xmath16 over the rational numbers ( this is not always true over the integers ) . we have calculated the @xmath16 page in many examples by computer ",

    "our hope is that , for those used to `` fulton s notation '' @xcite in toric geometry , having four names for these two lattices will _ reduce _ confusion . *",

    "we may associate a pair of toric varieties @xmath22 and @xmath23 to a reflexive pair of lattice polytopes .",
    "@xmath22 is a compactification of @xmath32 and @xmath23 is a compactification of @xmath33 , and they are characterized by the following properties : @xmath22 is gorenstein , its anticanonical bundle is ample , and the moment polytope of the anticanonical bundle is @xmath3 .",
    "following batyrev and borisov @xcite , we expect a mirror relationship between a smooth projective anticanonical hypersurface @xmath34 and a smooth projective anticanonical hypersurface @xmath35 .",

    "we will restrict our attention to pairs of reflexive polytopes where a resolution process is unnecessary : from now on we assume that @xmath3 is vertex - simplicial , and @xmath4 is facet - simplicial . in that case",
    "it is natural to regard @xmath22 as a smooth deligne - mumford stack instead of a variety with gorenstein singularities .",
    "( we explain how to do this in detail in sections [ sec : skeleta ] and [ sec : stackyfan ] . )",
    "the toric variety @xmath23 could still be quite singular , but these singularities are not visible to the hypersurface at the large volume limit .    1 .   the _ large complex structure limit _ or lcl is the union of the toric divisors of @xmath22 , regarded as a deligne - mumford stack .",
    "we denote it by @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath41 evidently inherits a complex structure ( necessarily singular , and possibly with some stackiness ) from @xmath42 .",
    "we endow @xmath43 with a symplectic structure ( necessarily exact ) induced from @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are polar coordinates on @xmath33 .",
    "though @xmath9 is canonically defined , @xmath11 depends on a choice of laurent polynomial @xmath38 .    with this notation , we can expect conjecture [ conj : hms2 ] to hold under a simplicial assumption :    [ conj : hms3 ] suppose @xmath3 is vertex - simplicial and @xmath4 is facet - simplicial .",
    "then there is an equivalence @xmath13 where the right - hand side denotes the fukaya category of compact lagrangian branes in @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we recall some notions from the microlocal sheaf theory of kashiwara - schapira @xcite , and its relationship to fukaya theory @xcite . in section [ sec : kashschasheaf ] , we introduce the `` kashiwara - schapira sheaf '' of dg categories , which is a variant of the theory of ( * ? ? ?",

    "microlocal sheaf theory is well - suited to studying the expected sheaf of fukaya categories on @xmath58 : using constructible sheaves , we can define a sheaf of categories with no fukaya theory in place .",
    "if @xmath59 is a conic open subset , kashiwara and schapira define the category of `` microlocal sheaves on @xmath60 '' to be the quotient @xmath61 .",
    "let us denote this category by @xmath62 .",
    "we may regard @xmath63 as a contravariant functor from the poset of conic open subsets of @xmath64 to the @xmath65-category of dg triangulated categories .",

    "we wish to probe the hms conjecture [ conj : hms3 ] using the coherent - constructible correspondence of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will apply the theory of those papers to the toric orbifold @xmath22 of section [ sec : rpams ] and its subvarieties , but let us start by recalling some features of the general case .",
