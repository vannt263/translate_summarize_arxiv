    "since the isolation of single layers of graphite in 2003 @xcite , many exciting works on single layer graphene ( slg ) have been done @xcite .",
    "for example , the prediction and observation of electron - hole symmetry and a half - integer quantum hall effect @xcite , finite conductivity at zero charge - carrier concentration @xcite , the strong suppression of weak localization @xcite , universal conductance @xcite , magnetic enhancement of optical conductance in graphene nanoribbons @xcite and strong nonlinear optical response in the terahertz frequency regime@xcite .",
    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) exhibits additional new properties not seen in single layer graphene , chief among them are the trigonal warping@xcite , a phenomenon solely due to the interlayer coupling .",
    "the trigonal warping is robust and independent of the interlayer coupling strength .",

    "behave qualitatively differently than in slg .",
    "phenomena such as interlayer drags@xcite and correlations@xcite are unique in blg .",
    "the electronic and transport properties of blg differ significantly from slg in many respects , particularly at the low energy ` dirac ' regime .",
    "various models for low energy blg exist in the literature depending on the coupling terms included , and whether electronic bands beyond the lowest energy subbands are retained @xcite .",
    "many interesting results are obtained based on a model that includes only the most dominant of the interlayer coupling terms in blg , as well as the usual nearest neighbor intralayer term @xcite . by including the second most dominant interlayer coupling , some unusual properties such as a peculiar landau - level spectrum @xcite , a new low energy peak in the optical conductance @xcite and retro - reflection of electrons in a blg / superconductor heterojunction @xcite",
    "have been demonstrated . by further increasing the number of layers , one has graphene multilayers",
    "whose energy dispersion near the @xmath2-point can be tuned by a gate voltage@xcite .",
    "blg has two distinct forms : the usual bernal stacking ( or ab - stacking ) where the a - sublattice of the top layer is stacked directly above the b - sublattice of the bottom layer , and the aa - stacking ( fig .",
    "1 ) where one layer is stacked directly above the other with exact matching of the sublattices @xcite . in aa - stacked blg , the energy dispersion in the low energy regime is made up of two shifted dirac cones .",
    "the dirac cones in aa - stacked blg are identical to that of the linear energy dispersion in slg , except that the two cones are offset from the slg dispersion by the interlayer hopping energy .",
    "there has been considerably less research into aa - stacked blg than ab - stacked blg as it was believed to be unstable .",
    "however recent studies have shown that blg in the form of aa - stacking can actually be formed stably @xcite .",

    "the transmitted electronic wavefunction does not exponentially decay while propagating within the potential barrier .",
    "instead , the incident electron state is connected to the positron state within the barrier which allows the undamped propagation of the incident particle across the potential barrier .",
    "a condensed matter version of the celebrated klein paradox has been demonstrated in slg and ab - stacked blg where the low energy electron is described by relativistic massless and massive dirac fermion , respectively @xcite . due to the conservation of pseudospin ,",
    "perfect electron transmission occurs in slg at normal incidence .",
    "in contrast to slg , the pseudospin of electrons in ab - stacked blg rotates twice as fast as the electron wavevector and this results in the perfect reflection of electrons at normal incidence .",

    "cloaking of electronic states in ab - stacked blg based on ` klein reflection ' has been proposed @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "we shall study the problem of electron tunneling across a non - magnetoelectric step potential barrier ( @xmath0-@xmath1 junction and @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath0 junction ) in aa - stacked blg .",
    "we found that klein tunneling occurs at normal incidence as a result of the dirac nature of the quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , the quasiparticles in aa - stacked blg are described by a ` cone index ' and we show that it is a strictly conserved quantity .",
    "such conservation leads to protected cone transport of electrons in aa - stacked blg which could potentially have applications in a device .",

    "are both @xmath4 in this case also .",
    "this results in the disappearance of the upper cone conductance , @xmath152 , and a sharp turning point occurs in the total conductance .",
    "the cone conservation in electron transport reported here is only possible in the case of a gapless band dispersion",
    ". a finite electron - electron interaction can give rise to a gap opening at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "in this case the cone conservation is not observed in the electron transport and both the reflected and transmitted states can be in any cone .",
    "this situation is very similar to single layer graphene where klein tunneling is only possible when the band structure is gapless @xcite . for aa - stacked graphene",
    ", it has also been shown that gap can close if the system is doped and the doping exceeds some threshold or the temperature is sufficiently high @xcite . in this case , the reported cone conservation is likely to be re - established as long as the electron fermi level still lies in the linear dispersion regime .",
    "the cone conservation is a direct consequence of eq .  .",
    "the total cancellation of the overlap of the wavefunctions when @xmath153 occurs due to the simple form of the aa - stacked blg eigenstates in which the components are only dependent on the angle of the incident wavevector . in the presence of a gap , such as the one introduced when",
    "an anti - ferromagnetic ordering is present@xcite , the eigenstates become a far more complicated function of the wavevector , and the cancellation of the overlap between eigenstates of different cones is no - longer possible .    in conclusion",
    ", we have theoretically investigated the quantum tunneling of electrons in aa - stacked blg . since the band structure of aa - stacked blg",
    "is made up of two shifted dirac cones , klein tunneling was found to occur in this system .",
    "the quasiparticles in aa - stacked blg are not only chiral but also labeled by an additional cone index . due to the orthogonality of the wavefunctions with different cone indices , the cone index is a conserved quantity .",
    "together with the negative refraction of electrons , the protected cone transport across an aa - stacked blg @xmath0-@xmath1 junction allows the transmitted electrons to be spatially separated according to their cone index .",
    "this suggests the potential of achieving ` cone - tronic ' devices in aa - stacked blg .",
    "the junction conductances were calculated for an @xmath0-@xmath1 junction and a number of difference between the results for aa - stacked blg and slg were found .",
    "first , due to the shifting of dirac cones in aa - stacked blg , the conductance plots of each individual cone were shifted as compared to those of slg .",
    "second , since in aa - stacked blg there are two transmission channels , the total conductance is the averaged sum of both channels in contrast to slg where only a single cone is involved . in ab - stacked blg , the total conductance is made up of four transmission channels whereas in aa - stacked graphene , only two intra - cone transitions are possible .",
    "further , electrons are perfectly reflected at normal incidence in ab - stacked blg and obey a considerably different tunneling probability to aa - stacked blg .",
    "finally , we purpose the theoretical results to be verified experimentally .",
