    "furthermore , it has been shown for models very closely related to the standard ising model that fractional powers occur in corrections to scaling  @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured that these would take the form @xmath254 , clearly a very important term in the current context .",

    "one of our main goals has been to check the extent to which the constant value of coefficient ratios , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : akbk ] ) , remains valid within the broader ising universality class .",
    "in section  [ sec : pbc ] we considered ising @xmath8 systems , on strips with pbc across .",

    "( [ eq : g3 ] ) . as a byproduct , the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : akbk ] ) has been directly verified within four orders of magnitude of anisotropy variation for this case .    in section  [ sec : fbc ] , for strips of spin-@xmath318 systems with fbc along one of the coordinate axes , we examined ways in which the non - constant frequency spacing in the eigenvalue spectrum can be dealt with , in order to make the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fe_fbc ] ) amenable to treatment via the euler - maclaurin summation formula .",
    "the lowest - order terms of the resulting expansion are shown to agree with known results .    from the correlation - length expression ,",
    "( [ eq : eta_fbc ] ) , we showed directly that both odd and even powers of inverse strip width are expected in corrections to scaling , and explicitly evaluated the two lowest - order non - universal coefficients [ @xmath78see eq .",

    "generalization to anisotropic systems is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_sfbc ] ) , where one can see that the first- and third order anisotropy factors ( respectively , @xmath123 and @xmath319 ) are the same as those for pbc [ @xmath78see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c3 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : sqrt ] ) , and  ( [ eq : g3])@xmath78 ] .      sections  [ sec : s=1 ] and  [ sec : nnn ] deal respectively with @xmath252 systems with first - neighbor interactions , and spin-@xmath318 ones with both first- and second - neighbor couplings . for pbc",
    "we find that , in both cases , the ratio @xmath246 differs considerably from the value @xmath321 found in ref .   for @xmath8 , first - neighbor couplings only .",
    "we quote @xmath268 for the former , and @xmath322 for the latter .",

    "although the error bars do not quite overlap , it appears that a constant value of this ratio can not be definitely discarded .",
    "however , no such regularity is seen for @xmath246 , its value being respectively @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 in each case .",
    "overall , it seems that both even and odd powers of @xmath36 always show up in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : eta1 ] ) , for critical ising strips with fbc along one coordinate axis . on the other hand , for pbc",
    "only odd ones occur .",
    "concurring remarks can be found in the literature  @xcite ; however , it seems difficult to prove such a statement rigorously .",
    "so far , one has to rely on case - by - case analyses , as was done here .",
    "as pointed out at the end of section  [ sec : fbc ] , considering the version of fbc with the tm running along the diagonal  @xcite is enough to restore a picture very similar to that holding for pbc  @xcite .",
    "thus , the behavior of subdominant corrections to scaling is sensitive to what might appear to be a minor technical detail .",
    "the constant value of amplitude ratios is maintained upon varying anisotropy for @xmath8 systems with first - neighbor couplings , either with pbc or fbc ; however , it does not seem to survive changes in spin @xmath6 , or introduction of further neighbor interactions .",
    "we have thus established that the observed , apparently universal , constant amplitude ratios pertain to a limited subset of systems which are in the broader ising universality class .",
    "it remains to be further investigated whether the close values found for @xmath329 with fbc in the three cases are indeed an indication of an actual constant ratio .",
