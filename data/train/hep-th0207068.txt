    "mirror symmetry has played important roles in exploring quantum modification of geometry in string theory .",
    "things started with the discovery of mirror pairs of calabi - yau manifolds @xcite with a subsequent application @xcite to superstring compactifications .",
    "it had an immediate impact on enumerative geometry and motivated various mathematical investigations including the formulation of gromov - witten invariants .",
    "another breakthrough was made through the recognition of d - branes as indispensable elements in string theory @xcite , which was preceded by konstevich s homological mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "studies and applications of mirror symmetry involving d - branes have enriched our understanding of quantum geometry .",
    "in particular , strominger - yau - zaslow ( syz ) proposed , using the transformation of d - branes under t - duality , that mirror symmetry of calabi - yau manifolds is nothing but dualization of special lagrangian torus fibrations @xcite .",
    "this provides a very geometric picture of mirror symmetry that inspired many physicists and mathematicians .",
    "recently , another progress is made via an exact analysis of quantum field theory on the worldsheet @xcite .",
    "mirror symmetry is derived as t - duality applied to gauge systems @xcite that flow to non - linear sigma models .",
    "this , however , turns sigma models into landau - ginzburg ( lg ) models , where the lg potential for the dual fields is generated by the vortex - anti - vortex gas of the high energy gauge system .",
    "what is the relation of this and syz , both of which use t - duality applied to torus fibers ?",
    "since syz employ d - branes wrapped on the torus fibers , it is a natural idea to do the same . in this talk , we present some applications of @xcite to study the properties of d - branes .",
    "in particular , we show that the study of d - branes wrapped on torus fibers indeed reproduces the lg mirror of @xcite .",
    "study of floer homology for intersecting lagrangians @xcite plays an important role .",
    "we will also present other aspects of mirror symmetry involving d - branes .",
    "let us consider a closed string moving in the circle of radius @xmath0 , which is described by a periodic scalar field @xmath1 on the worldsheet .",
    "the space of states is decomposed into sectors labeled by two conserved charges  the momentum @xmath2 associated with the translation symmetry @xmath3constant , and the winding number @xmath4 which counts how many times the string winds around the circle .",
    "the ground state in each sector has energy @xmath5-{1\\over 12}$ ] , which is invariant under @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the sigma model on the cricle of radius @xmath0 is equivalent to the sigma model on the circle of radius @xmath8 .",
    "this is called _",
    "t - duality_. the exchange of momentum and winding number can be described as the relation between the corresponding currents @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the time and space coordinates on the worldsheet and @xmath11 is the coordinate of the t - dual circle .",
    "let us now introduce an open string to this system .",
    "we need to specify the boundary condition on the scalar field @xmath12 at the worldsheet boundary , say , at @xmath13 .",
    "neumann boundary condition @xmath14 corresponds to the freely moving end point , while dirichlet boundary condition @xmath15 fixes the end point .",
    "they describe open strings ening on _ d - branes _ : the former is for a d1-brane wrapped on the circle while the latter is for a d0-brane at a point of the circle . by the relation ( [ tcurr ] ) , we see that t - duality exchanges the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "thus , t - duality maps a d1-brane wrapped on the circle to a d0-brane at a point of the t - dual circle .",
    "the open string end point is charged under @xmath16 gauge field on the d - brane .",
    "the holonomy @xmath17 parametrizes the gauge field configuration on the d1-brane wrapped on the circle . under t - duality , this parameter is mapped to the position of the d0-brane in the t - dual circle . therefore , t - dual of @xmath18 can be identified as the dual circle @xmath19 .",
    "this story generalizes to the higher dimensional torus @xmath20 : t - duality inverts the radiii of the torus , mapping a d@xmath21-brane wrapped on @xmath20 to a d0-brane at a point of the t - dual torus @xmath22 , where the map provides the identification @xmath23",
    ".    the same story applies to _ supersymmetric _ theories on the worldsheet , which are obtained by including fermionic fields as the superpartner of the scalar fields . when the target space is a kahler manifold , the system has _",
    "supersymmetry _ which is an extended symmetry with four supercharges @xmath25 ( @xmath26 shows the worldsheet chirality .",
    "the supercharges are complex but are related by hermitian conjugation @xmath27 ) .",
    "the complex coordinates of the target space are annihilated by @xmath28-variation , but are mapped to the partner dirac fermions under the @xmath29-variation .",
    "the simplest example is the cylinder @xmath30 with the ( flat ) product metric parametrized by the radius @xmath0 of the circle .",
    "t - duality applied to the @xmath18 yields another cylinder @xmath31 with radius @xmath8 .",
    "this is actually an example of _ mirror symmetry _ :",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are exchanged under the equivalence .",
    "t - duality maps the various d - brane configurations : d2-brane wrapped on @xmath34 is mapped to d1-brane extedning in the @xmath35-factor of @xmath36 ; d1-brane wrapped on @xmath18 at a point in the @xmath35-direction is mapped to d0-brane at a point of @xmath36 .",
    "let us next consider a more interesting target space  the two - sphere @xmath37 .",
    "it can be viewed as the circle fibration over a segment , and one may ask what happens if t - duality is applied fiber - wise . since t - duality inverts the radius of the circle , larger circle is mapped to smaller circle and smaller circle is mapped tolarger circle , and one may navely expect that the dual geometry is as in fig .  [",
    "t ? ] .",
    "since the size of the dual circle blows - up toward the two ends , two holes effectively opens up and the dual geometry has topology of cylinder .",
    "this is consistent in one aspect : the conserved momentum associated with the @xmath16-isometry of @xmath37 ( fiber - rotaion ) is mapped to the winding number of the dual system , which is conserved due to the cylindrical topology . however , another aspect is not clear .",
    "the winding number is not conserved in the original sysetm because @xmath38 , and this should mean in the dual theory that the momentum is not conserved or the translation symmetry is broken . but how can it be broken ?",
    "is it because the metric is secretly not invariant under rotation of the cylinder ?",
    "what really happens under t - duality is as follows .",
    "it is true that the dual geometry has topology of cylinder .",
    "however , the dual theory is not just a sigma model but a model called _ landau - ginzburg ( lg ) model_. it has a potential and yukawa coupling terms determined by a holomorphic function of the target space , called the _",
    "superpotential_. let us parametrize the dual cylinder by a complex coordinate @xmath39 which is periodic in the imaginary direction @xmath40 .",
    "then , the superpotential of the dual lg model is given by @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a complex parameter that corresponds to the data of the original @xmath37 sigma model : @xmath43 is the area of the original @xmath37 and @xmath44 determines the b - field ( it gives a phase factor @xmath45 to the path - integral measure for a worldsheet mapped to @xmath37 with degree @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is this superpotential that breaks the translation symmetry @xmath47 constant .",
    "this t - duality is a mirror symmetry , as in the example of cylinder .",
    "this was derived in @xcite by exact analysis of quantum field theory on the worldsheet .",
    "the derivation applies to the case where the target space is a general toric manifold @xmath12 . a toric manifold ,",
    "as @xmath37 is , can be viewed as the torus fibration over some base manifold , and t - duality sends the sigma model to a lg model .",
    "suppose @xmath12 is realized as the symplectic quotient of @xmath48 by @xmath49 action @xmath50 with the moment map equation @xmath51 , and suppose the b - field is such that the path - integral weight is @xmath52 for a map of multi - degree @xmath53 .",
    "then , the dual geometry is an @xmath54-dimensional cylinder defined by @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and the superpotential is given by @xmath57 .",
    "this mirror symmetry explains several observations made earlier @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite also includes the derivation of the mirror pairs of calabi - yau hypersurfaces or complete intersections in toric manifolds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the method can be applied also to string backgrounds with non - trivial dilaton @xcite and h - field @xcite .",
    "we do not repeat the analysis of @xcite in what follows .",
    "instead , we will find some of the consequences of the mirror symmetry , especially on d - branes .",
    "we will see that d - brane analysis sheds new light on the duality itself .",
    "recall that , for the circle sigma model , the dual circle was identified as the space of wrapped d1-branes , @xmath58 .",
    "the same will happen here ; the dual theory can be rediscovered by looking at the d - branes wrapped on the circle fibers of the toric manifold .",
    "abstractly , d - branes can be regarded as boundary conditions or boundary interactions on the worldsheet of an open string . we will focus on those preserving a half of the @xmath24 worldsheet supersymmetry .",
    "there are two kinds of such d - branes @xcite : a - branes preserving the combinations @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; b - branes preserving @xmath61 and @xmath62 . since mirror symmetry exchanges @xmath32 and @xmath33 , a - branes and b - branes are exchanged under mirror symmetry .",
    "let us consider the sigma model on a khler manifold @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath63 can be considered as a complex manifold or as a symplectic manifold ( with respect to the khler form @xmath64 ) . a d - brane wrapped on a cycle @xmath65 of @xmath63 and supporting a unitary gauge field",

    "a - branes and b - branes are objects of interest from the point of view of symplectic geometry and complex analytic geometry , respectively .",
    "they are exchanged under mirror symmetry .    of prime interest",
    "are the lowest energy states of open strings ending on d - branes .",
    "in particular , the supersymmetric ground states which correspond to massless open string modes .",
    "the theory of an open string stretched between two a - branes ( or two b - branes ) has one complex supercharge @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) . in many cases",
    ", it obeys the supersymmetry algebra @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "then , the system can be regarded as the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( with infinitely many degrees of freedom ) and the standard method @xcite applies . in particular , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the gound states and the @xmath75-cohomology classes .",
    "however , in some cases , the above algebra is modified and it can happen that @xmath76 in such a case , the cohomological characterization of the ground states does not apply .",
    "( in fact , there is no supersymmetric ground states . )",
