    "in recent years a novel approach to the nuclear matter problem based on effective field theory has emerged .",
    "its key element is a separation of long- and short - distance dynamics and an ordering scheme in powers of small momenta . at nuclear matter saturation density @xmath3@xmath4 the fermi momentum @xmath14 and the pion mass @xmath15 are comparable scales ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore pions must be included as explicit degrees of freedom in the description of the nuclear many - body dynamics .",
    "the contributions to the energy per particle , @xmath2 , of isospin - symmetric ( spin - saturated ) nuclear matter as they originate from chiral pion - nucleon dynamics have been computed up to three - loop order in refs.@xcite .",
    "both calculations are able to reproduce the empirical saturation point by adjusting one single parameter ( either a contact - coupling @xmath17 @xcite or a momentum cut - off @xmath18gev @xcite ) related to unresolved short - distance dynamics .",
    "the mechanism for saturation in these approaches is mainly a repulsive contribution to the energy per particle generated by pauli - blocking in second order ( iterated ) one - pion exchange .",
    "as outlined in ref.@xcite this mechanism becomes particularly transparent by taking the chiral limit @xmath19 . in that case the interaction contributions to the energy per particle are completely summarized by an attractive @xmath20-term and a repulsive @xmath21-term where the parameter - free prediction for the coefficient of the latter is very close to the one extracted from a realistic nuclear matter equation of state .",
    "this chiral approach to nuclear matter has been extended and improved in ref.@xcite by including systematically the effects from @xmath0-exchange with excitation of virtual @xmath1-isobars .",
    "the physical motivation for such an extension is threefold .",
    "first , the spin - isospin-@xmath22 @xmath1-resonance is the most prominent feature of low - energy @xmath23-scattering .",
    "secondly , it is well known that the @xmath0-exchange between nucleons with excitation of virtual @xmath24-isobars generates the medium- and long - range components of the isoscalar central @xmath7-attraction @xcite . in phenomenological one - boson exchange models this @xmath25-dynamics",
    "is often simulated by a scalar  @xmath26-meson exchange .",
    "thirdly , the delta - nucleon mass - splitting @xmath27mev is of the same size as the fermi momentum @xmath28 at nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "therefore pions and @xmath24-isobars should both be treated as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been found in ref.@xcite that the inclusion of the chiral @xmath29-dynamics significantly improves e.g. the momentum - dependence of the ( real ) single - particle potential @xmath30 and the isospin properties ( as revealed in the density - dependent asymmetry energy @xmath31 and the neutron matter equation of state @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , there remain some open questions in these perturbative calculations of nuclear matter .",
    "the effective short - range terms are adjusted directly to nuclear matter bulk properties and thus seem unrelated to those relevant for free @xmath7-scattering .",
    "also , no deeper justification for a perturbative treatment of nuclear matter ( besides of being very successful ) could be given .",
    "important progress in this direction has come recently from the work of bogner et al.@xcite based on the universal low - momentum @xmath7-potential @xmath33 .",
    "this potential operates by construction only between the low - momentum nucleon states , @xmath34gev , where it is truly determined by elastic @xmath7-scattering data .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that , due to the absence of a model - dependent short - range repulsive core in the potential @xmath8 , its second and higher order iterations in nuclear matter ( i.e. the successive terms in the brueckner ladder - series ) turn out to be small .",
    "the primary reason for this ( unconventional ) feature is the pauli exclusion principle : with increasing fermi momentum @xmath35 pauli - blocking reduces progressively the available low - momentum phase space wherein @xmath36 acts . under such conditions a perturbative treatment of the two - body interaction in nuclear matter turns out to be justified . it has also been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that a saturation of nuclear matter can not be achieved from the ( low - momentum ) two - body interaction alone (",
    "see also ref.@xcite for earlier hartree - fock calculations with @xmath8 exhibiting the same feature ) .",
    "repulsive three - nucleon interactions ( in particular the long - range ones induced by @xmath0-exchange ) are crucial in order to stabilize the nuclear many - body system against collapse . as emphasized in ref.@xcite in an effective low - energy theory ( with a  spatial resolution  of @xmath37fm as it is inherent to the @xmath8 potential ) many - body forces are inevitable . taking into account furthermore the dominant second order contributions from @xmath8 and the three - nucleon force ( adjusted partly to triton and @xmath38he binding energies ) a saturation minimum of @xmath39mev at the correct equilibrium density @xmath40@xmath41 has been obtained @xcite . presently , there is ongoing activity to further improve these calculations in order to close the remaining small gap to the empirical binding energy per particle , @xmath42mev .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to reanalyze the chiral approach to nuclear matter from this new perspective and to establish connections to the @xmath8 approach ( which actually starts from phase - shift equivalent @xmath7-potentials ) . as already mentioned , the second - order tensor force from iterated one - pion exchange plays an essential role in order to obtain binding and saturation of nuclear matter in the ( perturbative ) chiral approaches studied so far @xcite . on the other hand",
    "its strong short - distance components are one of the sources which render the brueckner ladder - series in nuclear matter non - perturbative ( i.e. not convergent ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore advisable to eliminate the high - momentum components from the pion - induced @xmath7-interactions . for that purpose",
    "we follow the phenomenology of the one - boson exchange potentials and introduce at each pion - nucleon interaction vertex a  form factor  of monopole type : @xmath43 with @xmath44 the monopole mass . here",
    ", @xmath45 denotes the squared four - momentum transfer carried by the virtual pion .",
    "typical values of the monopole mass @xmath10 employed in one - boson exchange potentials lie in the range : @xmath46gev @xcite . with the form factor",
    "@xmath47 included as a regulator on high - momentum components the @xmath48- and @xmath0-exchange contributions to the energy per particle @xmath9 depend on the monopole mass @xmath10 .",
    "as a first orientation we find that the  natural choice ",
    "@xmath49gev ( the chiral symmetry breaking scale ) reproduces correctly the empirical nuclear matter saturation point : @xmath50@xmath4 , @xmath51mev . as in the @xmath8 approach of ref.@xcite the inclusion of the pion - induced three - body terms ( with and without virtual @xmath24-isobar excitation ) is essential in order to achieve saturation of nuclear matter .",
    "however , a physical low - energy quantity such as the nuclear matter equation of state @xmath2 should not depend on a parameter @xmath10 which merely scans the",
    " spatial resolution  of the pion - baryon interactions involved .",
    "we demonstrate that this ( unphysical ) @xmath52-dependence of the pion - exchange contributions is , over a large range of monopole masses and densities , almost perfectly counterbalanced by the @xmath20- and @xmath53-terms related to two  running  short - distance contact - couplings @xmath54 .",
    "having reached a description of nuclear matter in terms of explicit pion - exchange dynamics , which is stable against variations of the short - distance scale @xmath10 , we can study the in - medium chiral condensate @xmath55 beyond the linear density approximation .",
    "these corrections are obtained by differentiating the calculated energy density of nuclear matter @xmath56 with respect to the pion mass ( or equivalently , the light quark mass @xmath57 ) . below the saturation density @xmath58@xmath4",
    "we find very small corrections . at higher densities a tendency counteracting chiral restoration sets in .",
    "moreover , there is little dependence of the derivative @xmath59 on the monopole mass @xmath10 ( assuming the short - distance contact - couplings @xmath60 to be independent of the quark mass ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present first the analytical expressions for the one- and two - pion exchange contributions to the energy per particle @xmath2 including the monopole form factors . then we discuss in section 3 the results for the nuclear matter equation of state together with the compensating short - distance contact - couplings @xmath54 .",

    "for example , one - loop chiral perturbation theory gives for the pion - decay constant the small derivative : @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the combination of lattice qcd results for @xmath168 and their chiral extrapolation @xcite one estimates @xmath171 around the physical point .",
    "corrections to @xmath59 from the @xmath15-dependence of the @xmath165-coupling constant @xmath172 , are therefore expected to be small , less than @xmath173 .    .",
    "]    fig.6 shows the dropping chiral condensate @xmath174 as a function of the nucleon density up to @xmath175@xmath4 .",
    "the full line corresponds to the linear density approximation using the central value @xmath176mev .",
    "the other curves include the effects of nuclear correlations through the derivative @xmath59 for various values of the monopole mass @xmath10 .",
    "we have assumed that the short - distance contact - couplings , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , which keep the saturation curve @xmath2 stable ( see section 3 ) are quark mass independent .",
    "this is a natural assumption , but difficult to substantiate further .",
    "one observes in fig.6 that up to equilibrium density @xmath179 the corrections beyond the linear density approximation are in fact very small .",
    "this finding can be taken as an a posteriori justification of the assumption made in ref.@xcite about the in - medium behavior of the scalar mean - field @xmath180 . at higher densities a trend counteracting chiral restoration sets in .",
    "similar features have been observed in the earlier chiral approach of lutz et al.@xcite as well as in ref.@xcite where the relativistic scalar - vector mean - field phenomenology has been combined with estimates of the quark mass derivatives .",
    "it is comforting to see that the explicit one- and two - pion exchange dynamics does not lead to the opposite trend , namely acceleration of chiral restoration , which would undermine the foundation of the present approach to nuclear matter , based on the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( in the vacuum ) .",
    "finally , one should note that the nucleon sigma - term @xmath164 has presently a sizable uncertainty of @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the error band associated with the linear density approximation @xmath182 masks practically all effects from nuclear correlations at least up to nuclear matter saturation density , @xmath183@xmath4 .",
    "in this work we have performed a nuclear matter calculation which treats the long - range correlations from one- and two - pion exchange explicitly . in accordance with the recent approach of ref.@xcite based on the @xmath36 potential we find that repulsive three - body terms are essential in order to achieve realistic binding and saturation of nuclear matter . as a novel feature",
    "we have introduced a pion - nucleon monopole form factor as a regulator to eliminate high - momentum components from the interactions .",
    "the dependence on the  resolution ",
    "parameter , the monopole mass @xmath10 , can be perfectly counterbalanced by two running short - distance contact - couplings @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting nuclear matter equation of state @xmath9 is stable against variations of @xmath10 .",
    "we have taken the pion mass derivative @xmath184 and obtained small corrections to the in - medium chiral condensate @xmath185 beyond the linear density approximation .    a more detailed comparison of the present nuclear matter calculation with the one based on the @xmath8 potential @xcite offers prospects for a better understanding of the relevant short - range @xmath7-dynamics , which so far enters in the form of two adjusted contact - couplings @xmath54 .",
    "work along these lines is in progress @xcite .",
