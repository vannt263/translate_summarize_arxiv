    "@xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4 salts are well - known organic conductors based on bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene ( bedt - ttf ) molecules which form dimers in the conduction layer .",
    "the compound @xmath5 is a monovalent anion , so the formal charge of bedt - ttf is + 0.5 .",
    "although this is regarded as a quarter - filled system , the electronic state of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4 is believed to be half filled due to the dimerization of the bedt - ttf molecules @xcite .    at ambient pressure",
    ", the ground state of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 [ hereafter abbreviated as the ( cn)@xmath2 salt ] is expected to be antiferromagnetic ( af ) because its ratio of @xmath6 is greater than that for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]cl [ hereafter abbreviated as the cl salt ] @xcite , where @xmath8 is the effective onsite coulomb repulsion and @xmath9 is the bandwidth , respectively .",
    "contrary to the expectation , the ( cn)@xmath2 salt exhibits no magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "one possible reason no - af ordering occurs in ( cn)@xmath2 salt is the contribution of geometrical frustration of spins @xcite . from density functional theory , we know that at room temperature , the ratio of interdimer transfer integrals @xmath10 = 0.83 is very close to unity @xcite , where @xmath11 is the nearest neighbor transfer and @xmath12 is the second - nearest neighbor transfer , respectively . moreover , as the exchange interaction , @xmath13 , the ratio of @xmath14 , is close to unity , suggesting a nearly isotropic triangular lattice with @xmath15 . in this case , af ordering could be suppressed by the geometrical frustration of the spins @xcite . however",
    ", optical conductivity measurements of ( cn)@xmath2 salt do not reveal a clear - cut energy gap at all temperatures @xcite , which is expected from a mott insulator due to the concomitant large @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , charge instability below 60 k was reported in ( cn)@xmath2 salt by @xmath3c nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "disorder or randomness is a source of localization in strongly correlated electron systems . in this case ,",
    "conduction electrons localize by impurity scattering to form an _",
    "anderson insulator_. contrary to a mott insulator , no gap appears at the fermi surface in anderson insulators .",
    "some theories predict that a soft hubbard gap whose density of state with zero density of states at @xmath16 emerges by introducing disorder to the strongly correlated electron system @xcite . due to competition between electron correlation and randomness , a mott  anderson transition is expected .",
    "recently , the disorder in the anion groups has been suggested to act on the bedt - ttf layers via hydrogen bonds , whereby the charge distribution is altered and domain boundaries appear in ( cn)@xmath2 salt @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the physical properties and disorder in ( cn)@xmath2 salt is of significant research interest .    experimental observations in ( cn)@xmath2 salt have been explained through triangular - lattice or disordered - state models .",
    "therefore , experimental verification is required to determine whether the observed behavior is due to the the geometrical frustration of the spins in the triangular lattice or to a disordered state .",
    "one approach is to artificially distort triangular lattices . to investigate the disorder effects of the mott - insulating state ,",
    "cl salt was irradiated by x - ray irradiation , which introduces disorder and changes the mott - insulating state of the cl salt into a soft - hubbard - gapped insulating state @xcite and , simultaneously , af ordering disappears @xcite",
    ".    note that x - ray irradiation mainly affects on the crystal surface owing to the absorption by cu atoms and produces free radicals on the surface .",
    "therefore , this technique is not suited for investigating the magnetic properties .",
    "moreover , it is unclear whether x - ray irradiation and anion disorder via hydrogen bonding in pure samples introduces disorder in the conduction plane .",
    "an alternative approach is analogous - molecular substitution to directly introduce disorder into the conduction layer , which is the method we use herein .",
    "specifically , we focus on a unsymmetric ( us- ) bis-(ethylenedithio)diselenadithiafulvalene ( bedt - stf ) , where in one side of the s in the central ring of the ttf skeleton is replaced with se atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ molecule ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the advantages of substituting bedt - stf for bedt - ttf are that ( i ) structural distortion is minimized because bedt - ttf and bedt - stf have almost the same molecular structure , ( ii ) the large spread of se 4@xmath17 orbital creates sufficient disorder to affect the intermolecular transfer integrals , and ( iii ) the substitution fraction and uniformity can be determined by elemental analysis to detect the se atoms , which exist only at substituted sites .        however , the primary important advantage is that the transfer integrals around the bedt - stf molecule are modified by the se orbitals , which locally distorts the triangular lattice .",
    "nmr is a microscopic probe that measures the static and dynamic magnetic properties .",
    "the local spin susceptibility can be determined from the knight shift @xmath18 , and magnetic fluctuations from the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath19 .",
    "many previous nmr studies of bedt - ttf salts have contributed important information on these salts @xcite .",

    "recently , @xmath54sr measurements by nakajima _",

    "to explain these results , nakajima _",
    "et al_. , invoked microscopic paramagnetic islands surrounded by a singlet sea with a finite gap .",
    "as the volume fraction of the singlet sea is much greater than that of the paramagnetic area , the paramagnetic spin behaves as a magnetic impurity , contributing only to the linewidth of the nonmagnetic nmr spectrum .",
    "thus , this picture is consistent with the small knight shift with a broad linewidth .",
    "therefore , the finite susceptibility in the static susceptibility measurements and proportionality of the linewidth to magnetic field at low temperature @xcite might be the consequence of this paramagnetic component .    for @xmath28 sample",
    ", the fwhm also rapidly increases below 15 k. one possible explanation of this result is that the impurity substitution induces the af moment ; however , this can be ruled out becuase if impurities induce the af moment , the fwhm for @xmath28 would be broader than that for the pure sample .",
    "however , the fwhm is almost the same for both samples at 1.7 k , in contrast to what happens above 15 k. conversely , the paramagnetic island proposed by @xmath54sr @xcite is indepedent of nonmagnetic impurities such as the bedt - stf , so the paramagnetic islands are independent of the bedt - stf impurities , resulting in a same - amplitude inhomogeneous dipole field in both samples , and translating into the same broadening in both samples .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath55 probes spin fluctuation , which is written as @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath58 is the hyperfine coupling constants between electron and nucleus , and @xmath59 is the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility at wave vector @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ t1 t ] compares the temperature dependence of @xmath61 of both samples with the result from a previous measurement of a double @xmath3c enriched sample under the same configuration @xcite .",
    "we determined @xmath19 by separately fitting a single exponential to the inner and outer sites , or by fitting the two - exponential models to the sum of the spectral intensity below 20 k by using the ratio , @xmath62 , which was determined at 100 k. this value is typical of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4 salts .",
    "as temperature decreases , the quantity @xmath61 increases and broadly peaks near 8 k. however , note that recovery curves for both samples deviate from the exponential fits below 6 k , which suggests distribution of @xmath19 .",
    "this distribution corresponds to the anomalous broadening below 8 k. using @xmath61 of the pure sample reproduces the results of previous work @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the ratio @xmath6 of ( cn)@xmath2 salt , a af transition temperature @xmath63 comparable to that of cl salt is expected .",
    "the suppression of the af transition indicates the characteristics of the geometrical frustration below the temperature @xmath64 k @xcite of the cl salt .",

    "two peaks are observed at 100 k. the nmr shift is less than that of the bulk sites , indicating a small local spin susceptibility .",
    "linewidth broadening occurs at low temperature and no af ordering appears .        in frustrated spin systems , impurities can induce local staggered moments and line broadening is expected owing to staggered spin density oscillations , as expected from the af character of magnetic correlations @xcite .",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath61 for impurity sites is similar to that for bulk sites , and the scale factor indicates a small local susceptibility compared with that of the bulk sites .",

    "note that recovery curves deviate from the exponential fits below 8 k , which suggests distribution of @xmath19 .",
    "the nmr spectra from impurity sites are similar to those from bulk sites , indicating that the magnetic behavior of ( cn)@xmath2 salt is not due to the geometrical frustration .",

    "@xmath61 for the impurity site is scaled by a factor of two.,width=298 ]",
    "we investigated the conductivity and the magnetic properties of ( cn)@xmath2 salt by artificially distorting its triangular lattice by substitution of bedt - stf , which introduces disorder by modifying the transfer integrals among the bedt - stf molecules .",
    "temperature dependence of conductivity of a sample with impurity fraction @xmath28 is not much changed above 200 k , indicating that the substitution enhances conductivity and leads to a crossover temperature @xmath40 that is greater than that of a pure sample . at low temperature , the @xmath28 sample exhibits vrh - like conductivity , suggesting that no intrinsic gap opens and that the sample is not a mott insulator like the pure sample @xcite .",
    "the nmr spectra reveal no magnetic ordering , and the spin susceptibility approaches to the chemical shift below 3 k in both samples .",
    "these results are inconsistent with finite susceptibility from the static magnetic measurement at low temperature . from 60 to 15 k ,",

    "nmr spectra from impurity sites suggest a decrease in local spin susceptibility and that no staggered moments are induced .",
    "thus , the results indicate that the static and dynamic susceptibility do not change , even at temperatures two orders of magnitude less than the exchange interaction @xmath68 250 k. these results are in stark contrast to the expected effect of the substitution on conductivity .",
