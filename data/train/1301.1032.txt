    "dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) appear when dispersion dominates dissipation for step - like data ; they have been seen in plasmas @xcite , fluids ( e.g. , undular bores ) @xcite , superfluids @xcite , and optics @xcite . the korteweg ",
    "de  vries ( kdv ) equation is the leading - order asymptotic equation for weakly dispersive and weakly nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "each step in well - separated , multi - step data forms its own dsw ; these dsws interact and develop multiphase dynamics @xcite .",

    "we find this long - time asymptotic solution using the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) and matched - asymptotic analysis .",
    "this merging of shock waves is similar to viscous shock waves ( vsws ) , where dissipation dominates dispersion and only a single vsw remains in the long - time limit . while the linear kdv equation s solution for step - like data in the middle region has width @xmath0 ( see  [ sec : linearkdv ] ) and the kdv equation s solution for vanishing data has a collisionless shock of width @xmath1 $ ] ( see  [ sec : vanishing ] ) , the dsw that we find has width @xmath2 (  [ sec : dsw ] ) .",
    "we anticipate that our ist and matched - asymptotic procedure will be applied to other integrable nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) with step - like data .    here",
    "we consider dsws described by the kdv equation  the leading - order asymptotic equation for systems with weak dispersion and weak , quadratic nonlinearity .",
    "the kdv equation , in dimensionless form , is @xmath3 where subscripts denote partial derivatives .",

    "we use the ist method ( see @xcite ) and matched - asymptotic expansions ( see @xcite ) to find a large - time asymptotic solution .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      on the dsw s left , there is a decaying , slowly varying , oscillatory similarity - solution ( as there is with vanishing data @xcite ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12,\\ ] ] and @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on the scattering data .",
    "we could , in principle , sum the neumann series from the glm integral equation formulated from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in the long - time limit to find @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the glm integral equation formulated from @xmath15 to @xmath16 has the same form for both step - like and vanishing data .",

    "burgers equation ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) is the leading - order asymptotic equation for vsws . if we take initial data that go rapidly to the boundary conditions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then the long - time asymptotic solution is @xmath41\\}$ ] , where @xmath42 is a real constant that depends on the initial data @xcite .",
