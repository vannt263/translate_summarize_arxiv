    "quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information processing and quantum computation@xcite , accordingly its quantification has drawn much attention in the last decade . in order for such quantification legitimate measures of entanglement",
    "are needed as a first step .",
    "the existing well - known bipartite measure of entanglement with an elegant formula is the concurrence derived analytically by wootters@xcite and the entanglement of formation@xcite is a monotonically increasing function of concurrence .",
    "they have been applied to describing quantum phase transition in various interacting quantum many - body systems@xcite .",
    "another useful entanglement measure is negativity@xcite , regarded as a quantitative version of peres criterion for separability . comparing with the concurrence , the process calculating the negativity",
    "is significantly simplified with respect to mixed states since it does not need the convex - proof extension .",
    "on the other hand , multipartite entanglement is a valuable physical resource in large - scale quantum information processing@xcite and plays an important role in condensed matter physics .",
    "the negativity is used to study multipartite entanglement in a fermi gas@xcite .",
    "however , it is a formidable task to quantify multipartite entanglement since there is few well - defined multipartite entanglement measures just like for bipartite systems . as for now , the widely - used basis for characterizing and quantifying tripartite entanglement is the three - tangle @xcite . very recently",
    "the proof for the general ckw inequality for bipartite entanglement@xcite and the demonstration that the ckw inequality can not generalize to higher - dimensional systems@xcite have been provided .",
    "recall that the concurrence of a two - qubit state @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 , in which @xmath4 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath5 in nonincreasing order and @xmath6 is a pauli spin matrix . for a pure three - qubit state @xmath7 ,",
    "the ckw inequality in terms of concurrence can read @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the concurrences of the mixed states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 . according to eq.([a ] )",
    "the three - tangle can be defined as @xmath15 which is used to characterize three - way entanglement of the state@xcite .",
    "for example , quantified by the three - tangle , the state @xmath16 has only three - way entanglement , while the state @xmath17 has only two - way entanglement . for a general mixed three - qubit state of @xmath7",
    "the three - tangle should be @xmath18-c_{ab}^{2}-c_{ac}^{2}$ ] , where @xmath19 has to be minimized for all possible decomposition of @xmath7 .",
    "now one may wonder whether there exist other entanglement measures satisfying eq.([a ] ) and whether the three - way entanglement of a given state provided by these entanglement measures is the same .",
    "this will help us further understand genuine multipartite entanglement .    to this end ,",
    "the main result of this paper is to provide a monogamy inequality in terms of negativity . in sec",
    "ii , we recall some basic concepts of the negativity . in sec iii , we deduce the monogamy inequality in terms of negativity . in sec iv and v ,",
    "the three-@xmath0 analogous to three - tangle is defined , which is shown to be a natural entanglement measure . by calculation on the @xmath20 state , the @xmath21 state , and the superposed states of the two states ,",
    "the three-@xmath22 is shown to be greater than zero , i.e. , for such states there always exists three - way entanglement .",
    "it is also shown that the three-@xmath0 is always not less than the three - tangle for any tripartite pure states and can be extended to mixed three - qubit states and general pure @xmath23-qubit states .",
    "the conclusions are in sec vi .",
    "for a either pure or mixed state @xmath24 in the tensor product @xmath25 of two hilbert spaces @xmath26 , @xmath27 for two subsystems @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the partial transpose with respect to @xmath28 subsystem is @xmath30 and the negativity is defined by @xmath31 where the trace norm @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the necessary and sufficient inseparable condition for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bipartite quantum systems@xcite . in order for any maximally entangled state in @xmath35 systems to have the negativity one",
    ", it can be reexpressed as @xmath37with only a change of the constant factor 2 .",
    "therefore @xmath38 for bell states like @xmath39 and vanishes for factorized states . for pure two - qubit systems in terms of the coefficients @xmath40 of @xmath41 with respect to an orthonormal basis",
    "the concurrence is defined as @xmath42 . from eq.([c ] ) it is easy to check that @xmath43 for such systems .",
    "now let us consider pure three - qubit systems @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath44 in the standard basis @xmath45 , where each index takes the values 0 and 1 : @xmath46 . for our goal",
    "it is necessary to show @xmath47 .",
    "the density matrix of @xmath48 is @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "following from eq.([c ] ) we arrive at @xmath51where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are eigenvalues of @xmath55 .",
    "the obtaining of the third formula is based on the property of the trace norm @xmath56 , observation that @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is equal to the sum of the square root of eigenvalues @xmath59 of @xmath55 with @xmath60 . from another observation that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are also the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath63 whose matrix elements are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the concurrence between @xmath28 and @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 , the last formula is obtained .",
    "the next paragraphs are devoted to one of the main results of this paper .",
    "for any pure @xmath68 states @xmath69 , the entanglement quantified by the negativity between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , between @xmath28 and @xmath44 , and between @xmath28 and the single object @xmath66 satisfies the following ckw- inequality - like monogamy inequality @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the negativities of the mixed states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .    in order to prove eq.([g1 ] ) it is helpful to recall the theorem appearing in@xcite , which states that for any @xmath73 mixed state @xmath2 , the concurrence @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 in our considered qubit system , @xmath76",
    ". therefore it follows from eqs.(c ) and ( [ g2 ] ) that @xmath77 , implying the negativity is never greater than the concurrence in this case . thus for the state @xmath78 observing eqs.([a ] ) , ( [ g ] ) and ( [ g3 ] ) , the conclusion in eq.(g1 ) can be proved .    in a similar way , if one takes the different focus @xmath29 and @xmath44 , the following monogamy inequalities @xmath79 and @xmath80 hold also .     for the state in eq.(9 ) as a function of the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "only two coefficients are independent since @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 is always greater than zero and reaches maximal value @xmath85 when @xmath86 , which , to a certain degree , demonstrates why the @xmath1 state is maximally entangled.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now one naturally would like to care about the tightness of the monogamy inequality in eq.([g1 ] ) .",
    "all pure three - qubit states can be sorted into six classes through stochastic local operation and classical communication(slocc)@xcite .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath28@xmath29@xmath44 class including product states ; ( 2 ) @xmath87@xmath66 , ( 3 ) @xmath29@xmath88 , and ( 4 ) @xmath44@xmath89 classes including bipartite entanglement states ; ( 5 ) @xmath1 and ( 6 ) ghz classes including genuine tripartite entanglement states .",
    "for the first four classes it is easy to verify that eqs.([g1 ] ) , ( [ g11 ] ) , and ( [ g12 ] ) turn out to be an equality , being the same to the ckw inequality .",
    "however , it is different for the @xmath1 class . for the following pure state of @xmath90 : latexmath:[\\[\\label{h }    which belongs to the @xmath1 class .",
    "substituting @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 into eq.([g1 ] ) we have @xmath95 , resulting in that the inequality in eq.([g1 ] ) is strict due to @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , while the ckw inequality can only be an equality for the @xmath1 class@xcite .",
    "having seen that both the equality and inequality in eq.([g1 ] ) can be satisfied by some three - qubit states , we can define the residual entanglement , which is referred to as the three-@xmath0 in order to distinguish from the three - tangle in the following main results of this paper .",
    "the difference between the two sides of eq.([g1 ] ) can be interpreted as the residual entanglement @xmath99 likewise , eqs.([g11 ] ) and ( [ g12 ] ) gives birth to the corresponding residual entanglement as @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath44 in @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 mean that qubit @xmath28 , qubit @xmath29 , and qubit @xmath44 are taken as the focus , respectively .",
    "unlike the three - tangle , in general @xmath105 , which can be easily confirmed after calculating them for the state in eq.([h ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the residual entanglement corresponding to the different focus is variant under permutations of the qubits .",
    "we take @xmath106 ( referred to as the three-@xmath0 ) as the average of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108 which thus becomes invariant under permutations of the qubits since , for example , permutation of qubit @xmath28 and qubit @xmath29 accordingly only leads to exchanging @xmath102 and @xmath103 with each other in @xmath106 .    as we will prove here",
    ", the three-@xmath0 in eq.([j ] ) is a natural entanglement measure satisfying three necessary conditions@xcite .",
    "the first condition is that the three-@xmath0 should be local unitary ( lu ) invariant .",
    "after lu transformations @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 acted separately on a pure three - qubit state @xmath7 , the state can read @xmath112 .",
    "it is necessary to prove that the six squared negativities in eq.([j ] ) are invariant under the three simultaneous lu transformations .",
    "since @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 is lu invariant . similarly @xmath116 and @xmath117 are also lu invariant . while @xmath118 , together with the property that the negativity itself is lu invariantpere , vidal , leads to @xmath119 .",
    "thus @xmath120 is lu invariant , so are @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "now we finish proving the first condition .",
    "observation of eqs.([g1 ] ) , ( [ g11 ] ) and ( [ g12 ] ) shows that @xmath123 , thus the second condition is satisfied .",
    "moreover , it is easy to verify that @xmath124 for product pure states .",
    "@xmath106 is invariant under permutations of the qubits allows us to use proof outline@xcite to confirm the third condition .",
    "let us consider local positive operator valued measure ( povm s ) for one qubit only .",
    "let @xmath125 and @xmath126 be two povm elements such that @xmath127 .",
    "we can write @xmath128 , with @xmath129 and @xmath130 being unitary matrices , and @xmath131 being diagonal matrices with entries @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "consider an arbitrary initial state @xmath134 of qubit @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath44 with @xmath135 .",
    "after the povm , @xmath136 .",
    "normalizing them gives @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "therefore @xmath140 . taking into account both the fact that @xmath141 due to its lu invariance and the key fact that three-@xmath0 is also a quartic function of its coefficients in the standard basis which can be seen from the calculation for the state of eq.([h ] ) , we have @xmath142 and @xmath143 . after simple algebra calculations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath144 , thus the third condition that the three-@xmath0 should be an entanglement monotone is satisfied .",
    "( solid line ) , @xmath145(dashed line ) , and squared @xmath146 ( dashed - dotted line ) for the state @xmath147 in eq.(15 ) as a function of @xmath148 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the minimal value of @xmath149 .",
    "the two measures match at @xmath150 and @xmath151.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in order to explicitly see the difference between the three-@xmath0 and the three - tangle we present the following two examples .",
    "_ example 1 : the different classes by slocc .",
    "_ for the state in eq.(h ) belonging to the @xmath1 class we get @xmath152 we also have performed extensive numerical calculation on three-@xmath0 of the other states in the @xmath1 class and found that it is always greater than zero ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) as shown in eq.([q ] ) for the sate @xmath154 ( see also fig.1 ) , implying these states have three - way entanglement also .",
    "taking into account that @xmath155 a conclusion that the three - tangle underestimates three - way entanglement can be drawn .",
    "for the ghz class we have the property that @xmath156 . while @xmath157 for the states @xmath158 belonging to the classes excluding the @xmath1 and ghz classes .",
    "( solid line ) , @xmath159(dashed line ) , and squared @xmath160 ( dashed - dotted line ) for the state @xmath161 in eq.(15 ) as a function of @xmath148 .",

    "_ quantifying of multipartite mixed states is also a fundamental issue in quantum information theory .",
    "an optimal decompositions for the three - tangle of mixed three - qubit states composed of a ghz state and a @xmath1 state is obtained@xcite . in order to further explore the relationship between three-@xmath0 and three - tangle we first write down superposed state of ghz and @xmath1 states",
    "@xmath164 is known as @xmath165 and with eqs.([h1]-[j ] ) we plot @xmath166 ( see fig.2 and 3 ) .",
    "the two measures shows similar trend and the fact that @xmath167 is shown .",
    "notice that the similar result was obtained also in@xcite , however , their defined residual entanglement @xmath168 is not an entanglement measure@xcite . on the other hand , for the state @xmath147 the location of @xmath148 of the minimal value of the two measures does not match(see fig.2 ) , i.e. , when @xmath169 the extremely minimal @xmath170 which is smaller than @xmath171 being equal to @xmath149 when @xmath172 .",

    "summarizing , we proved a monogamy inequality in terms of negativity such that the three-@xmath0 is defined so as to quantify the residual entanglement for three - qubit states .",
