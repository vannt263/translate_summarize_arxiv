    "the weak gravitational lensing of light from distant sources by the large scale structure in the universe results in the appearance of shear and convergence in images .",

    "their work was conducted in a cosmological simulation with density parameter @xmath8 and vacuum energy density parameter @xmath9 , for which the deceleration parameter is @xmath10 .",
    "they found for this cosmology that if the computed median demagnification for @xmath11 were applied to the observed supernov  at this redshift it would shift their positions on the hubble diagram indicative of a different cosmology with @xmath12 .",

    "wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have used the same ray - tracing method as described by wambsganss , cen and ostriker ( 1998 ) for cosmological simulations with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and normalisation @xmath14 .",
    "the magnification values above and below which 97% of all of their lines of sight fall were @xmath15 and @xmath16 for source redshifts of @xmath11 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath6 .",
    "the median values for the magnification were 0.983 at @xmath11 , and 0.993 at @xmath19 .",
    "the authors claim that these values would give rise to observed values of @xmath20 for the @xmath11 data , and @xmath21 for the @xmath19 data , rather than the assumed value of @xmath22 .",
    "( the quoted errors arise from the magnification ranges described above in the asymmetrical distributions . ) they also report that the lensing - induced dispersions in their critical density cosmology are three times larger , but this cosmology uses a normalisation of @xmath23 which overproduces the present - day rich cluster abundances . for this cosmology , they report magnifications up to 100 , and correspondingly highly dispersed distributions , very much larger than those of barber et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for @xmath24 .",
    "the high magnifications almost certainly derive from the low value of their ( fixed ) softening scale .",
    "fluke , webster and mortlock ( 1999 ) and fluke , webster and mortlock ( 2000 ) have used a ` ray - bundle ' method in which a discrete bundle of light rays is traced .",
    "the method allows a direct comparison between the shape and size of the bundle at the observer and at the source plane , so that the magnification , ellipticity and rotation can be determined straightforwardly .",
    "the cosmological models investigated were similar to those of barber et al .",
    "however , the particles were considered as point masses , so that very high magnification values could be achieved in principle ; however , to alleviate this situation , the authors do not include bundles which pass within @xmath25 of the einstein radius of any particle . because of their use of point particles , they use the empty beam approximation which gives rise to magnification probability distributions with minimum magnifications of 1 ( and therefore mean and median values greater than , or equal to , one ) , high magnification tails , and broad dispersions in magnification . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the distribution in the magnifications for the scdm cosmology ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) is clearly broader than that for the low density ( lcdm ) cosmology ( @xmath13 , @xmath4 ) , which in turn is broader than the open ( ocdm ) cosmology ( @xmath28 @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is also true of barber et al.s ( 2000 ) data , although barber et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a completely different order for the cosmologies at higher source redshifts . because of the high magnification tails in fluke , webster and mortlock s ( 2000 ) distributions",
    ", they discard those high magnification lines of sight which occur with low probability before defining the @xmath29 and @xmath30 values .",
    "these magnification probability distributions are then used by fluke and webster ( 2000 ) to examine the effects of the weak lensing dispersion on measurements of @xmath31 in both the empty beam ( more appropriate for point particles ) and full beam limits .",
    "they consider whether the resulting shifts in the hubble diagram can be fitted with various cosmological models . with input data from the @xmath7 magnification distribution for the flat lcdm simulations , they find that @xmath32 from the empty beam distribution . to convert their empty beam magnification values to filled beam values , fluke and webster ( 2000 ) use a simple scaling relationship .",
    "however , since the filled beam approach is inappropriate to their method , the resulting values should be treated with caution .",
    "they find the revised value @xmath33 ; i.e. , a much larger departure than for the empty beam approximation , but a similar dispersion . again",
    "the dispersion can be partly explained in terms of their use of point particles , although they do attempt to modify their distributions to account for the high magnification tails .",
    "it should be mentioned that wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have assumed that the observed supernov  have magnifications of unity , and then have assessed departures from the best fit cosmology , rather than assuming that the best fit cosmology comes from the most likely demagnification at the peak of the magnification distributions , which is the approach i take in this paper .",
    "although fluke and webster ( 2000 ) use the median magnification values , the values are always close to unity and greater than , or equal to , unity for the empty beam case .",
    "the cosmological @xmath0-body simulations used in the study by barber et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were provided by the hydra consortium and produced using the ` hydra ' @xmath0-body hydrodynamics code ( couchman , thomas and pearce , 1995 ) .",
    "results are reported on simulations from four different cosmologies , referred to as the scdm , tcdm , ocdm and lcdm cosmologies .",
    "each of the simulations uses a cold dark matter - like spectrum , and the parameters used in the generation and specification of these simulations are listed in table  [ cosmo ] .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the present - day values of the density parameter and the vacuum energy density parameter respectively .",
    "the power spectrum shape parameter , @xmath36 , is set to 0.5 in the scdm cosmology , but the empirical determination ( peacock and dodds , 1994 ) of 0.25 for cluster scales has been used in the other cosmologies . in each case , the normalisation , @xmath37 , on scales of @xmath38mpc has been set to reproduce the number density of clusters ( viana and liddle , 1996 ) ; @xmath39 is the hubble parameter expressed in units of 100 km  s@xmath40mpc@xmath40 .",

    "( 1998 ) have recognised that weak lensing of high - redshift type ia supernov  can alter the observed magnitudes , and quote the findings of wambsganns et al .",
    "( 1997 ) i.e. , that the light will be on average demagnified by 1.7% at @xmath7 in a universe with a non - negligible cosmological constant .",
    "they state that the size of this effect is negligible .",
    "perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) assume that the effects of magnification or demagnification will average out , and that the most over - dense lines of sight should be rare for their set of 42 high - redshift supernov .",
    "however , they note that the average ( de)amplification bias from integration of the probability distributions is less than 1% for redshifts of @xmath42 .",
    "my work has shown that , in the lcdm cosmology , a source at @xmath7 will have a median deamplification of 3.4% ( @xmath43 ) , and 1.3% at @xmath6 .",
    "whilst these demagnification factors are still small , they can result in repositioning of the supernov  data on the hubble diagram with significantly revised values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , there is a significant probability of observing highly magnified supernov ; 97% of all lines of sight display a range of magnifications up to 1.191 at @xmath7 , and this range is equivalent to a dispersion in the magnitudes of 0.252 .",
    "the standard deviation in the asymmetrical distributions at @xmath11 is 0.078 magnitudes .",
    "this is to be compared with the accepted intrinsic dispersion of 0.17 magnitudes for type ia supernov  reported by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in a set of low - redshift supernov . for sources at a redshift of 2 , however , barber et al.s ( 2000 ) data predict a standard deviation of 0.185 magnitudes from weak lensing , in excess of the intrinsic dispersion",
    ". clearly , the weak lensing dispersion will become increasingly important as supernov  at greater redshifts are discovered .    in the work by wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the cosmology with @xmath8 and @xmath9 they found @xmath15 and @xmath16 for source redshifts of @xmath11 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath6 .",
    "their median magnification values were 0.983 for @xmath11 and 0.993 for @xmath19 .",
    "these may be compared directly with the values shown in table  [ mu4c ] for the magnifications in the @xmath44 @xmath4 cosmology i have investigated , i.e. , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for source redshifts of @xmath11 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath6 .",
    "the median values are 0.966 for @xmath11 and 0.987 for @xmath49 .",
    "since the most likely effect of weak lensing is a slight demagnification of the source , it is probable that the originating data used by riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) may suffer from such a demagnification , and therefore should be re - positioned on the hubble diagram at brighter positions ( i.e. , lower distance moduli ) .",
    "this would then point to a slightly different cosmology with a different deceleration parameter .",
    "i plot , in figure  [ modulus / omega ] , the distance modulus values at @xmath7 , for various values of @xmath34 , centred around @xmath13 , and keeping @xmath50 .",
    "the plot has been generated by solving equation  [ modulus ] numerically .",
    "@xmath51    with no magnification , @xmath52 @xmath4 , @xmath53 , and @xmath11 , the distance modulus is 44.2626 .",
    "now assume that this cosmology is the best fit to the observed data .",
    "then , by making a redshift 1 supernova brighter than observed ( assuming it was observed at the peak of the magnification distribution , with @xmath43 ) the distance modulus would be reduced to 44.2250 , equivalent to @xmath54 , and equivalent to changing @xmath31 from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "for the rms deviations in the magnification , the distance modulus changes by @xmath57 , equivalent to revised @xmath31 values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for the @xmath30 and @xmath29 values at @xmath7 , @xmath31 changes to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the conclusion , on the evidence of these data , is that true underlying cosmologies with @xmath62 may be interpreted as having @xmath2 , from the use of perfect standard candles ( without intrinsic dispersion ) , arising purely from the effects of weak lensing .",
    "this adjustment to the value of @xmath31 is almost an order of magnitude larger than that found by wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on a cosmology with @xmath63 @xmath9 , and the dispersion in the values is slightly larger than their findings .",
    "i have summarised the results for the magnification distributions for the different cosmologies for different source redshifts as obtained by barber et al . (",
    "2000 ) in table  [ mu4c ] . at high redshift",
    ", the lcdm cosmology produces the highest magnifications , the broadest distribution curves , and the lowest peak values . for sources at @xmath64 in the lcdm cosmology , 97% of all lines of sight have magnification values up to 1.850 .",
    "( the maximum magnifications , not quoted here , depended on the choice of the minimum softening in the code , although the overall distributions were very insensitive to the softening . ) the rms fluctuations in the magnification ( about the mean ) were as much as 0.191 in this cosmology , for sources at @xmath64 . even for sources at @xmath6",
    "there is a measurable range of magnifications in all the cosmologies .",
    "the immediate implication is the likely existence of a bias in observed magnitudes of distant objects , and a likely dispersion for standard candles , for example , type ia supernov  at high redshift . in particular , the weak lensing dispersion from 97% of the lines of sight expected in the peak magnitudes for type ia supernov  at redshifts of 1 may be as much as 0.252 magnitudes .",
    "the standard deviations in the distributions are 0.078 magnitudes for @xmath11 and 0.185 magnitudes for @xmath65 .",
    "these values are to be compared with the accepted dispersion of 0.17 magnitudes , so that we should expect to see an increasing dispersion for the peak magnitudes of supernov  as they are discovered at higher redshifts .",
    "i have made use of the magnification statistics from the lcdm cosmology , to reanalyse the results for the cosmological parameters determined from the high - redshift type ia supernov  data .",

    "the dispersions in the magnification are monotonically increasing with redshift , and have rms fluctuations about the mean of 0.045 for @xmath67 , and 0.016 for @xmath68 .",
    "these have been translated into variations in distance modulus , which , in turn , suggest a different cosmological model for the data . on the assumption that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 is the cosmology which fits the observed data best ,",
    "my results indicate that the true underlying cosmology could have @xmath69 based on the peak magnification values , with a spread of @xmath70 based on the computed magnification dispersion .",
    "this would represent a significant adjustment to the cosmological parameters .",
    "wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a median demagnification value much closer to unity ( 1.7% below for @xmath11 ) in their cosmology with @xmath63 @xmath9 than barber et al .",

    "however , the magnification dispersions give rise to similar dispersions in @xmath31 .",
    "wambsganss et al.s ( 1997 ) calculated adjustment to @xmath31 is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the departure i would suggest .",
    "fluke , webster and mortlock s ( 2000 ) estimate for the revised value of the deceleration parameter ( @xmath71 for the @xmath72 @xmath4 cosmology ) in the empty beam approximation is only half the value of the departure i suggest .",
    "the value of their dispersion can not be easily compared with mine , because of their use of the empty beam approximation , which gives rise to a different form for the distribution curve with values of magnification which are always positive . furthermore , their method to convert the empty beam magnification values ( more appropriate to their method ) to filled beam values was not rigorous , so that the resulting values should be treated with caution .    both wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and fluke , webster and mortlock ( 2000 ) have assumed that the observed supernov  have magnifications of unity , so that the median demagnifications when using the filled beam approach are assumed to reposition the supernov  at dimmer magnitudes .",

    "i have adopted the opposite viewpoint .",
    "i have assumed that the supernov  are observed at their median demagnification values , and therefore have to be repositioned at brighter magnitudes ( i.e. , reduced distance moduli ) to obtain the correct cosmological parameters .",
