    "when a nonlinear system shows unexpectedly simple behavior , it may be a clue that some hidden structure awaits discovery .",
    "for example , recall the classic detective story  @xcite that began in the 1950s with the work of fermi , pasta , and ulam  @xcite . in their numerical simulations of a chain of anharmonic oscillators ,",
    "fermi et al .",
    "were surprised to find the chain returning almost perfectly , again and again , to its initial state .",
    "the struggle to understand these recurrences led zabusky and kruskal  @xcite to the discovery of solitons in the korteweg ",
    "devries equation , which in turn sparked a series of results showing that this equation possessed many conserved quantities  in fact , infinitely many  @xcite .",
    "then several other equations turned out to have the same properties . at the time these results seemed almost miraculous .",
    "but by the mid-1970s the hidden structure responsible for all of them  the complete integrability of certain infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems  @xcite  had been made manifest by the inverse scattering transform  @xcite and lax pairs  @xcite .",
    "something similar , though far less profound , has been happening again in nonlinear science .",
    "the broad topic is still coupled oscillators , but unlike the conservative oscillators studied by fermi et al . , the oscillators in question now are dissipative and have stable limit cycles .",
    "this latest story began around 1990 , when a few researchers noticed an enormous amount of neutral stability and seemingly low - dimensional behavior in their simulations of josephson junction arrays  specifically , arrays of identical , overdamped junctions arranged in series and coupled through a common load  @xcite .",
    "then , just a year ago , antonsen et al .",
    "@xcite uncovered similarly low - dimensional dynamics in the periodically forced version of the kuramoto model of biological oscillators  @xcite .",
    "this was particularly surprising because the oscillators in that model are non - identical .",
    "as in the soliton story , these numerical observations then inspired a series of theoretical advances .",
    "these included the discovery of constants of motion  @xcite , and of a pair of transformations that established the low - dimensionality of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "but what remained to be found was the final piece , the identification of the hidden structure . without it ,",
    "it was unclear why the transformations and constants of motion should exist in the first place .    in this paper",
    "we show that the group of mbius transformations is the key to understanding this class of dynamical systems .",
    "our analysis unifies the previous treatments of josephson arrays and the kuramoto model , and clarifies the geometric and algebraic structures responsible for their low - dimensional behavior .",
    "one spin - off of our approach is a new set of constants of motion ; these generalize the constants found previously , and hold for a wider class of oscillator arrays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . to keep the treatment self - contained and to establish notation , section  [ background ] reviews the relevant background about coupled oscillators and the mbius group . in section  [ mobius group reduction ]",
    "we show how to use mbius transformations to reduce the dynamics of oscillator arrays with global sinusoidal coupling , a class that includes the josephson and kuramoto models as special cases .",
    "the reduced flow lives on a set of invariant three - dimensional manifolds , arising naturally as the so - called group orbits of the mbius group .",
    "the results obtained in this way are then compared to previous findings ( section  [ connections to previous results ] ) and used to generate new constants of motion via the classical cross ratio construction ( section  [ characteristics of the motion ] ) . we explore the dynamics on the invariant manifolds in section  [ chaos in josephson arrays ] , and show that the phase portraits for resistively coupled josephson arrays are filled with chaos and island chains , reminiscent of the pictures encountered in hamiltonian chaos and kam theory .",
    "the theory developed here was originally motivated by simulations of the governing equations for a series array of @xmath0 identical , overdamped josephson junctions driven by a constant current and coupled through a resistive load . as shown in tsang et al .",
    "@xcite , the dimensionless circuit equations for this system can be written as @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "the physical interpretation need not concern us here ; the important point for our purposes is that this set of @xmath0 ordinary differential equations ( odes ) displayed low - dimensional dynamics .",
    "the same sort of low - dimensional behavior was later found in other kinds of oscillator arrays  @xcite as well as in josephson arrays with other kinds of loads  @xcite .",
    "building on contributions from several teams of researchers  @xcite , watanabe and strogatz  @xcite showed that the system ( [ jj_resistive ] ) could be reduced from @xmath0 odes to three odes , in the following sense . consider a time - dependent transformation from a set of constant angles @xmath6 to a set of functions @xmath7 , defined via @xmath8 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\gamma(t)}{1-\\gamma(t ) } } \\tan\\left[\\frac{\\theta_j-\\theta(t)}{2}\\right]\\ ] ] for @xmath5 . by direct substitution",
    ", one can check that the resulting functions @xmath7 simultaneously satisfy all @xmath0 equations in ( [ jj_resistive ] ) as long as the three variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy a certain closed set of odes  @xcite .",
    "watanabe and strogatz also noted that the same transformation can be used to reduce any system of the form @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is any smooth , complex - valued , @xmath14-periodic function of the phases @xmath15 .",
    "( here the overbar denotes complex conjugate .",
    "also , note that @xmath16 has to be real - valued since @xmath17 is real . )",
    "the functions @xmath13 and @xmath16 are allowed to depend on time and on any other auxiliary state variables in the system , for example , the charge on a load capacitor or the current through a load resistor for certain josephson junction arrays .",
    "the key is that @xmath13 and @xmath16 must be the same for all oscillators , and thus do _ not _ depend on the index @xmath18 .",
    "we call such systems _ sinusoidally coupled _ because the dependence on @xmath18 occurs solely through the first harmonics @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    soon after the transformation ( [ ws_transformation ] )",
    "was reported , goebel  @xcite observed that it could be related to fractional linear transformations , and he used this fact to simplify some of the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite . at that point ,",
    "research on the reducibility of josephson arrays paused for more than a decade .",
    "the question of _ why _ this particular class of dynamical systems ( [ reducible ] ) should be reducible by fractional linear transformations was not pursued at that time , but will be addressed in section  [ mobius group reduction ] .",
    "ott and antonsen  @xcite recently reopened the issue of low - dimensional dynamics , with their discovery of an ansatz that collapses the infinite - dimensional kuramoto model to a two - dimensional system of odes .    to illustrate their ansatz in its simplest form ,",
    "let us apply it to the class of identical oscillators governed by eq.([reducible ] ) , in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "( note that this step involves two simplifying assumptions , namely , that @xmath0 is infinitely large and that the oscillators are identical .",
    "the ott - antonsen ansatz applies more generally to systems of non - identical oscillators with frequencies chosen at random from a prescribed probability distribution  indeed , this generalization was one of ott and antonsen s major advances  but it is not needed for the issues that we wish to address . ) in the limit @xmath21 , the evolution of the system ( [ reducible ] ) is given by the continuity equation @xmath22 where the phase density @xmath23 is defined such that @xmath24 gives the fraction of phases that lie between @xmath25 and @xmath26 at time @xmath27 , and where the velocity field is the eulerian version of ( [ reducible ] ) : @xmath28 our earlier assumptions about the coefficient functions @xmath13 and @xmath16 now take the form that @xmath13 and @xmath16 may depend on @xmath27 but not on @xmath25 . the time - dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath16 can arise either explicitly ( through external forcing , say ) or implicitly ( through the time - dependence of the harmonics of @xmath29 or any auxiliary state variables in the system ) .",
    "following ott and antonsen  @xcite , suppose @xmath29 is of the form @xmath30 for some unknown function @xmath31 that is independent of @xmath25 .",
    "( our definition of @xmath31 is , however , slightly different from that in ott and antonsen  @xcite ; our @xmath31 is their @xmath32 . )",
    "note that ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) is just an algebraic rearrangement of the usual form for the poisson kernel : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined via @xmath36 in geometrical terms , the ansatz ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) defines a submanifold in the infinite - dimensional space of density functions @xmath29 . this _ poisson submanifold _ is two - dimensional and is parametrized by the complex number @xmath31 , or equivalently , by the polar coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the intriguing fact discovered by ott and antonsen is that the poisson submanifold is invariant : if the density is initially a poisson kernel , it remains a poisson kernel for all time . to verify this , we substitute the velocity field ( [ velocity ] ) and the ansatz ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) into the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) , and find that the amplitude equations for each harmonic @xmath37 are simultaneously satisfied if and only if @xmath38 evolves according to @xmath39    this equation can be recast in a more physically meaningful form in terms of the complex order parameter , denoted by @xmath40 and defined as the centroid of the phases @xmath25 regarded as points @xmath41 on the unit circle : @xmath42 by substituting ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) into ( [ z ] ) we find that @xmath43 for all states on the poisson submanifold .",
    "hence , @xmath40 satisfies the riccati equation @xmath44    when @xmath13 and @xmath16 are functions of @xmath40 alone , as in mean - field models , eq.([riccati ] ) constitutes a closed two - dimensional system for the flow on the poisson submanifold .",
    "more generally , the system will be closed whenever @xmath13 and @xmath16 depend on @xmath29 only through its fourier coefficients .",
    "we will show this explicitly in subsection  [ fourier coefficients of the phase distribution ] , by finding formulas for all the higher fourier coefficients in terms of @xmath31 , and hence in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "( however , as we will see , things become more complicated for states lying off the poisson submanifold .",
    "then @xmath40 no longer coincides with @xmath31 and the closed system becomes three dimensional , involving @xmath45 as well as @xmath31 . )",
    "the work of ott and antonsen  @xcite raises several questions .",
    "why should the set of poisson kernels be invariant ?",
    "what is the relationship , if any , between the ansatz ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) and the transformation ( [ ws_transformation ] ) studied earlier ? why does ( [ ws_transformation ] ) reduce equations of the form ( [ reducible ] ) to a three - dimensional flow , whereas ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) reduces them to a two - dimensional flow ?",
    "as we shall see , the answers have to do with the properties of the group of conformal mappings of the unit disc to itself . before showing how this group arises naturally in the dynamics of sinusoidally coupled oscillators ,",
    "let us recall some of its relevant properties .",
    "consider the set of all fractional linear transformations @xmath46 of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are complex numbers , and the numerator is not a multiple of the denominator ( that is , @xmath50 ) .",
    "this family of functions carries the structure of a group .",
    "the group operation is composition of functions , the identity element is the identity map , and inverses are given by inverse functions .    of most importance to us",
    "is a subgroup @xmath51which we refer to as the _ mbius group_consisting of those fractional linear transformations that map the open unit disc @xmath52 onto itself in a one - to - one way .",
    "these transformations and their inverses are analytic on @xmath53 and map its boundary ( the unit circle @xmath54 ) to itself .",
    "all such automorphisms of the disc can be written  @xcite in the form @xmath55 for some @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the mbius group @xmath51 is in fact a three - dimensional lie group , with real parameters @xmath58 re@xmath59 , and im@xmath59 .",
    "however , it turns out that a different parametrization of @xmath51 will be more notationally convenient in what follows , in the sense that it simplifies comparisons between our results and those in the prior literature .",
    "specifically , we will view a typical element of @xmath51 as a mapping @xmath60 from the unit disc in the complex @xmath61-plane to the unit disc in the complex @xmath62-plane , with parametrization given by @xmath63 where @xmath57 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that the inverse mapping @xmath65 has an appearance closer to that of the standard parametrization ( [ usual_automorphism_parametrization ] ) .    a word about terminology : our definition of the mbius group is not the conventional one .",
    "usually this term denotes the larger group of all fractional linear transformations ( or bilinear transformations , or linear fractional transformations ) , whereas we reserve the adjective mbius for the subgroup @xmath51 and its elements .",
    "thus , from now on , when we say _ mbius transformation _ we specifically mean an element of the subgroup @xmath51 consisting of analytic automorphisms of the unit disc .",
    "in this section we show that if the equations for the oscillator array are of the form ( [ reducible ] ) , then the oscillators phases @xmath7 evolve according to the action of the mbius group on the complex unit circle : @xmath66 for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a one - parameter family of mbius transformations and @xmath6 is a constant ( time - independent ) angle .",
    "in other words , the time-@xmath27 flow map for the system is always a mbius map .",
    "incidentally , this result is consistent with a basic topological fact : we know that different oscillators can not pass through each other on @xmath69 under the flow , so we expect the time-@xmath27 flow map to be an orientation - preserving homeomorphism of @xmath69 onto itself  and indeed any mbius map is .",
    "we begin the analysis with an algebraic method similar to that in goebel  @xcite .",
    "then , in sections  [ geometric method of finding dotalpha ] and  [ geometric method of finding dotpsi ] , we adopt a geometrical perspective and show that it answers several questions left open by the first method .",
    "parametrize the one - parameter family of mbius transformations as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and let @xmath73 to verify that ( [ 2 ] ) gives an exact solution of ( [ reducible])subject to the constraint that the mbius parameters @xmath38 and @xmath74 obey appropriate odes , to be determined  we compute the time - derivative of @xmath75 , keeping in mind that @xmath76 is constant : @xmath77 from ( [ inverse_parametrization ] ) , we get @xmath78 which when substituted into ( [ 3 ] ) yields @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "note that eq.([5 ] ) falls precisely into the algebraic form required by ( [ reducible ] ) .",
    "thus , to derive the desired odes for @xmath38 and @xmath74 , we now subtract ( [ 5 ] ) from ( [ reducible ] ) to obtain @xmath0 equations of the form @xmath81 , for @xmath67 .",
    "if the system contains at least three distinct oscillator phases , then @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 must generically be zero .",
    "explicitly , @xmath85 the system ( [ 6 ] ) can be algebraically rearranged to give    [ 7 ] @xmath86    equations ( [ 7a ] ) and ( [ 7b ] ) have been derived previously ; they appear as eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) , respectively , in pikovsky and rosenblum s work  @xcite , where they were derived by applying the transformation ( [ ws_transformation ] ) .",
    "both their approach and the one above are certainly quick and clean , but they require us to guess the transformation ahead of time , and reveal little about why this transformation works .    incidentally , observe that under the change of variables @xmath87 , ( [ reducible ] ) becomes @xmath88 equation  ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "is a riccati equation with the form of ( [ 7a])another coincidence that seems a bit surprising when approached this way . in the following subsection",
    ", we will see how these ricatti equations emerge naturally from the infinitesimal generators of the mbius group .",
    "now we change our view of mbius maps slightly . instead of thinking of @xmath60 as a map from the @xmath61-plane to the @xmath62-plane",
    ", we view it as a map from the @xmath62-plane to itself .",
    "this requires a small and temporary change in notation , but it makes things clearer , especially when we start to discuss differential equations on the complex plane .",
    "we begin by recalling some basic facts and definitions .",
    "suppose the coupled oscillator system contains just three distinct phases among its @xmath0 oscillators .",
    "then by a property of mbius transformations , there exists a unique mbius transformation from any point @xmath90 to any other point @xmath91 in the state space @xmath92 .",
    "if the system instead contains only one or two distinct phases , many mbius transformations will take @xmath93 to @xmath94 , so we can still reach every point of the phase space from every other point .",
    "however , if the system contains more than three distinct phases , say @xmath0 , then there is not in general a mbius transformation that transforms @xmath95 to @xmath96 ; only some points are accessible from @xmath93 , while others are not .    in the language of group theory",
    ", we say that @xmath94 is in the _ group orbit _ of @xmath93 if there exists a mbius map @xmath60 such that @xmath97 .",
    "then , as a direct consequence of the fact that mbius maps form a three - parameter group @xmath51 under composition , the group orbits of @xmath51 partition the phase space into three - dimensional manifolds ( when the phase space is at least three - dimensional ) .",
    "to compute infinitesimal generators for @xmath51 , we compute the time derivatives of the three one - parameter families of curves corresponding to the three parameters of @xmath51 : @xmath45 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "each of the three families is obtained from the mbius transformation by setting two of the three parameters to zero , and leaving the remaining parameter free .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath100 at @xmath101 , these three families are @xmath102 where @xmath103 is written in place of @xmath104 and likewise for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we continue using this shorthand in subsequent equations , writing @xmath107 in place of @xmath108 for any one - parameter function @xmath109 .",
    "the time derivatives of the curves in ( [ 7.1 ] ) evaluated at @xmath100 then give a set of infinitesimal generators for @xmath51 : @xmath110 note that these three generators point out into the full @xmath0-dimensional complex space @xmath111 , as expected .",
    "meanwhile , if we substitute @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are real functions ) into the original riccati dynamics ( [ 1.1 ] ) , we can rewrite this equation of motion in terms of the three infinitesimal generators : @xmath115    the implication of the rewritten form ( [ 7.3 ] ) is then given by a theorem from lie theory : if @xmath116 is a lie group acting on a submanifold with linearly independent infinitesimal generators @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is a vector field of the form @xmath119 where the coefficients @xmath120 depend only on time @xmath27 , then the trajectory of the dynamics @xmath121 from any initial condition @xmath122 can be expressed in the form @xmath123 for a unique family @xmath124 parameterized by @xmath27 . since the mbius group is a complex lie group , this result can be applied directly to conclude ( [ 7.3 ] ) has the solution @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a unique one - parameter family of mbius transformations .",
    "although we have so far assumed that the components @xmath127 of @xmath128 lie on the complex unit circle , both ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 7.3 ] ) extend naturally to all of @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that @xmath129 must evolve as @xmath130 for some family @xmath126 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ 2 ] ) shows that @xmath131 for all @xmath132 .",
    "so @xmath133 for all @xmath27 , meaning that @xmath38 satisfies ( [ 7.3 ] ) . since ( [ 7.3 ] )",
    "is just a rewriting of ( [ 1.1 ] ) , the dynamics ( [ 7a ] ) for @xmath31 that we derived earlier are now placed in a geometrical context .",
    "this approach reveals that @xmath38 is just the image of the origin under a one - parameter family of mbius maps , applied to any one complex plane of @xmath111 .",
    "it is even more illuminating to compute the infinitesimal generators within the @xmath0-fold torus @xmath134 of phase values , i.e. , the quantities @xmath135 .",
    "these turn out to be @xmath136 when expressed in terms of these infinitesimal generators , the equation of motion ( [ 7.3 ] ) becomes @xmath137 which is precisely what we earlier referred to as a sinusoidally coupled system ( [ reducible ] ) , and whose solution must therefore be of the form @xmath138 for some @xmath139 .",
    "this calculation finally clarifies what is so special about sinusoidally coupled systems ( [ reducible ] ) : they are induced naturally by a flow on the mbius group .",
    "this fact underlies their reducibility and all their other beautiful ( but non - generic ) properties .",
    "we turn next to the dynamics of @xmath45 .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the action of the mbius transformation involves a clockwise rotation of the oscillator phase density @xmath23 by @xmath141 and a counterclockwise rotation by @xmath142 .",
    "hence , @xmath74 may be viewed as the overall counterclockwise rotation of the distribution at time @xmath27 relative to the initial distribution at @xmath100 .    to support this interpretation ,",
    "we show here that @xmath140 equals the average value of the vector field on the circle , given by @xmath143 observe the right side of the integrand ( [ 3 ] ) has two terms : @xmath144 by cauchy s formula , @xmath145 so @xmath146 simplifies to @xmath147 note that @xmath148 has a pole in the unit disc , so we make the change of variables @xmath149 to move this pole outside the circle .",
    "evaluating the resulting integral yields @xmath150 which completes the demonstration that @xmath151 .",
    "we can now go back and evaluate the average vector field in a different way to find the differential equation that governs @xmath74 .",
    "differentiating @xmath152 with respect to time and substituting the result into @xmath153 , we obtain @xmath154 since @xmath68 obeys the ricatti equation , we can eliminate @xmath155 in the numerator above to get @xmath156 there are three integrals to evaluate here .",
    "the third one involves a term @xmath157 which has a pole inside the unit circle , so we do the same change of variables as before , @xmath149 , to move the pole outside .",
    "the corresponding integral then simplifies to @xmath158 where the final integration follows from cauchy s formula .",
    "similiarly , we use cauchy s formula to integrate the first and second terms of the integrand in ( [ 7.9 ] ) , and thereby obtain the desired differential equation for @xmath45 , thus rederiving ( [ 7b ] ) found earlier .",
    "it is natural to ask how the trigonometric transformation ( [ ws_transformation ] ) used in earlier studies  @xcite relates to the mbius transformation ( [ 2 ] ) used above .",
    "as we will see , ( [ ws_transformation ] ) may be viewed as a restriction of ( [ 2 ] ) to the complex unit circle .",
    "first , by trigonometric identities , we have @xmath159 = i\\frac{1- e^{i(\\phi-\\phi)}}{1 + e^{i(\\phi-\\phi)}}.\\ ] ] to connect this to mbius transformations , consider what happens when we apply the map defined by ( [ 2 ] ) to a point @xmath160 on the unit circle . since the image is also a point on the unit circle , it can be written as @xmath161 for some angle @xmath25 .",
    "next let @xmath162 and divide both sides of ( [ 2 ] ) by @xmath163 .",
    "thus @xmath164 where @xmath165 .",
    "substitution of ( [ trigtomobius ] ) into the right side of ( [ 9 ] ) gives @xmath166 = \\frac{1-r}{1+r } \\bigg(i\\frac{1- e^{i(\\theta-\\theta)}}{1 + e^{i(\\theta-\\theta)}}\\bigg).\\ ] ] by the identity ( [ 9 ] ) , eq.([10 ] ) is equivalent to ( [ ws_transformation ] ) with @xmath167 .",
    "we can now see how the mbius parameters @xmath31 and @xmath45 operate on the set of @xmath168 in @xmath169 . from the relationships between @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath35 and the mbius parameters ,",
    "the initial phase density is first rotated clockwise around @xmath69 by @xmath141 , then squeezed toward one side of the circle as a function of @xmath172 , and afterwards rotated counterclockwise by @xmath142 .",
    "the squeeze , which takes uniform distributions to poisson kernels , can be thought of as a composition of inversions , dilations and translations in the complex plane .",
    "in section  [ ott - antonsen ansatz ] and in a previous paper  @xcite , we used the ott - antonsen ansatz ( [ oa_ansatz ] ) to show that systems of identical oscillators with global sinusoidal coupling contain a degenerate two - dimensional manifold among the three - dimensional leaves of their phase space foliation .",
    "this two - dimensional manifold , which we called the poisson submanifold , consists of phase densities @xmath23 that have the form of a poisson kernel .",
    "we now rederive these results within the framework of mbius transformations .",
    "let @xmath173 denote one instance of the transformation ( [ ws_transformation ] ) ; in other words , fix the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath171 and @xmath170 and let @xmath174 .",
    "let @xmath175 denote the normalized uniform measure on @xmath69 ; thus @xmath176 the transformation @xmath173 maps @xmath175 to the measure @xmath177 , and , by the usual formula for transformation of single - variable measures , we have @xmath178 , where the prime denotes differentiation by @xmath25 . from this equation",
    "it follows that @xmath179 has the form of the poisson kernel , because the inverse of the mbius transformation ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath180 which implies @xmath181 then by differentiation and algebraic rearrangement , we obtain @xmath182 the integral of @xmath183 over @xmath184 is @xmath185 , so @xmath179 is indeed a normalized poisson kernel .",
    "finally , if the phase distribution @xmath186 ever takes the form of a poisson kernel with parameters @xmath187 and @xmath188 , then we can set @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and the above calculation shows that @xmath186 remains a poisson kernel for all future and past times .",
    "hence , the set of normalized poisson kernels constitutes an invariant submanifold of the infinite - dimensional phase space .",
    "the above demonstration also reveals that the poisson submanifold has dimension @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the number of state variables besides @xmath31 , @xmath45 and the oscillator phases .",
    "more concretely , it implies that when the system lies on the poisson submanifold , we can write @xmath89 as depending only on @xmath31 ; it is not possible to require @xmath89 to depend on @xmath45 in any real coupling scheme .    to see this , we first consider the case in which the system is closed and there are no additional state variables .",
    "suppose @xmath89 does _ not _ depend only on @xmath31 .",
    "then some of the state space trajectories cross when projected onto the unit disc of @xmath31 values . at the point of any crossing , the phase density @xmath23 has multiple @xmath89 values .",
    "but by ( [ 13 ] ) , the phase density depends only on @xmath31 , so there is nothing in the state space that can distinguish between the different @xmath89 values at that point .",
    "hence , @xmath89 must be expressible in terms of @xmath31 alone . by an analogous argument",
    ", @xmath89 is also independent of @xmath45 on the poisson submanifold when there are @xmath193 other state variables besides the oscillator phases and mbius parameters .    on the other hand , if the time - dependence of @xmath89 arises only via a dependence on @xmath31",
    ", then @xmath34 and @xmath35 decouple from @xmath45 and the dynamics are two - dimensional regardless of whether the system is evolving on the poisson submanifold or not .",
    "observe that we can always force @xmath45-independence for @xmath89 by throwing away enough information about the locations of the other phases .",
    "for instance , in the extreme , we may simply make @xmath13 and @xmath16 constant .",
    "finally , even when @xmath89 does not depend solely on @xmath31 , the dynamics still may be two dimensional .",
    "for example , in the case of completely integrable systems  @xcite , the variables @xmath34 and @xmath194 decouple from @xmath35 to foliate the phase space with two - dimensional tori .",
    "the reduction of ( [ reducible ] ) by the three - parameter mbius group suggests that the corresponding system of coupled oscillators should have @xmath1 constants of motion .",
    "as we will see , these conserved quantities are given by the cross ratios of the points @xmath195 on @xmath69 .",
    "recall from complex analysis  @xcite that the _ cross ratio _ of four distinct points @xmath196 is @xmath197 this quantity is conserved under mbius transformations : for all @xmath31 and @xmath45 , @xmath198 . hence , the @xmath199 cross ratios of the @xmath0 oscillator phases remain constant along the trajectories in phase space .",
    "we denote the constant value of @xmath200 as @xmath201 .",
    "of course , we could have defined the cross ratio for four - tuples of _ non - distinct _ points as well , but these quantities are trivially conserved regardless of the dynamics and hence do not reduce the dimension of the phase space .    to show that exactly @xmath1 of the cross ratios are independent , consider the sequence : @xmath202 @xmath203 .",
    "each cross ratio in the sequence includes a new point not in the cross ratios preceding it and therefore must be independent of them . hence , there are at least @xmath1 independent cross ratios . with a bit more work",
    "( see the appendix ) , we can also confirm that the rest of the cross ratios are functionally dependent on these @xmath1 integrals .",
    "since the state space of the phases is an @xmath0-fold torus of real variables , we expect that each of the constants of motion can be expressed in terms of real functions and variables .",
    "indeed , if @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 lie on the unit circle , then the cross ratio @xmath200 lies on @xmath208 .",
    "we see this explicitly by pulling out @xmath209 from the factor @xmath210 of @xmath211 , and likewise for the other three factors , and then canceling the factors @xmath212 in the numerator and denominator to find @xmath213 where @xmath214.\\ ] ]    this way of writing the cross ratio also suggests a relationship with the constants of motion reported by watanabe and strogatz  @xcite for completely integrable systems ( those with @xmath215 and @xmath216 , where @xmath40 is the phase centroid ( [ z ] ) ) .",
    "these constants of motion , which we will call _ ws integrals _ , take the form @xmath217 where any permutation of the indices generates another ws integral . as previously demonstrated  @xcite , exactly @xmath218 of the @xmath219 index permutations of ( [ 17.2 ] ) are functionally independent .    as we might anticipate , the ws integrals imply that the cross ratios are constants of motion : consider two distinct ws integrals @xmath220 and @xmath221 , where @xmath222 denotes the remaining product of factors .",
    "assume @xmath222 is the same for both @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "then @xmath225 .",
    "since @xmath226 , @xmath18 , @xmath193 , @xmath227 are arbitrary , we can generate all cross ratios via this procedure .    additionally ,",
    "if a single ws integral holds for a system in which the cross ratios are invariant , then _ all _ ws integrals hold , since we can arbitrarily permute the indices of the first ws integral by sequences of transpositions of the form @xmath228 in which @xmath227 and @xmath193 are interchanged .",
    "when we introduced @xmath13 and @xmath16 in section  [ background ] , we required that they depend on the phases _ only _ through the fourier coefficients of the phase density @xmath23 .",
    "since the centroid ( [ z ] ) is the fourier coefficient corresponding to the first harmonic @xmath229 , this condition is met by standard kuramoto models , josephson junction series arrays , laser arrays and many other well - studied systems of globally coupled oscillators .",
    "our goal now is to show that this condition implies the closure of ( [ 7 ] ) , in the sense that @xmath89 and @xmath140 depend only on @xmath31 and @xmath45 .",
    "to do so , we will show that the fourier coefficient of all higher harmonics @xmath230 for any integer @xmath231 may be expressed in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath45 .    for a fixed measure @xmath232 on @xmath184 and a transformation @xmath233 of this measure via the mbius map",
    "@xmath60 , the fourier coefficient of @xmath230 is given by @xmath234 we use the notation @xmath235 as a reminder that @xmath40 is the phase centroid .",
    "we assume that we can take a fourier expansion of @xmath232 , so @xmath236 where the constants @xmath237 are independent of @xmath238 .",
    "since the phase distribution must be real and normalized , we know that @xmath239 and @xmath240 , so we can write @xmath241 where @xmath160 and @xmath242 .",
    "the formula for @xmath235 then becomes : @xmath243 now , @xmath244 is analytic on the open disc @xmath53 and @xmath245 .",
    "meanwhile , the remaining term of the integrand of ( [ 20 ] ) has the complex conjugate @xmath246 which features an order-1 pole at @xmath247 and an order-@xmath231 pole at @xmath248 .",

    "recall from section  [ invariant manifold of poisson kernels ] that poisson kernels arise when we take @xmath175 to be the uniform measure .",
    "then @xmath253 for all @xmath254 and @xmath43 .",
    "in this exceptional case , the centroid simply evolves according to the riccati equation ( [ riccati ] ) and the dynamics of @xmath31 and @xmath45 decouple in eqs .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) , ( [ 7b ] ) .",
    "( a similar observation about the crucial role of the uniform measure here was made by pikovsky and rosenblum  @xcite . the centroid evolution equation ( [ 7a ] ) on the poisson submanifold was first written down by ott and antonsen ; see eq.(6 ) in ref .",

    "but for the generic case of states lying off the poisson submanifold , @xmath40 is no longer equal to @xmath31 and the reduced dynamics become fully three - dimensional , due to the coupling between @xmath31 and @xmath45 induced by the relation ( [ 25 ] ) and the dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath16 on @xmath40 and the higher fourier coefficients . in the next section",
    "we will explore some of the possibilities for such three - dimensional flows .",
    "although the leaves of the foliation imposed by the mbius group action are only three - dimensional , they often contain chaos for commonly studied @xmath13 and @xmath16  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we showcase this phenomenon by specializing to the case of a resistively - loaded series array of overdamped josephson junctions .    in several previous studies of sinusoidally",
    "coupled oscillators in the continuum limit , it was found that under certain conditions , the fourier harmonics of the phase density @xmath23 evolved as if they were decoupled , at least near certain points in state space  @xcite . in the spirit of these observations",

    "quasiperiodic trajectories ( ideally ) appear as closed curves or island chains , periodic trajectories appear as fixed points or period-@xmath291 points of integer period , and chaotic trajectories fill the remaining regions of the unit disc .",

    "along the bifurcation curve @xmath304 , the two rows of fixed points merge at @xmath305 , and we find computational evidence that a splay state ( for which @xmath306 ) emerges from their union and moves inside the unit disc along the @xmath284-axis toward the origin as @xmath281 is decreased or @xmath282 is increased .",
    "we can see from ( [ 29 ] ) that any such state must lie on the @xmath284-axis for all parameter values , as it did in previous characterizations of the poisson submanifold  @xcite .",
    "for the submanifolds we examined , chaos only appeared in the portion of the first quadrant in the @xmath281-@xmath282 plane that did not contain the fixed points , and the chaos became more widespread as @xmath307 .",

    "we show that the @xmath199 cross ratios of the oscillator phases are functionally dependent on the @xmath1 cross ratios @xmath316 .",
