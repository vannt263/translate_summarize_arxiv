    "recently , euclidean simplicial quantum gravity(sqg ) with the additional matter fields has been investigated with using the monte - carlo simulation . from the previous numerical simulation@xcite",
    ", we expect the four - dimensional(4d ) simplicial model realizes the realistic 4d quantum gravity .",
    "especially , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the relation between sqg and the 4d conformal gravity@xcite , calculating with the grand - canonical method . however , in order to discuss the relation between the discretized model and the continuum theory in detail , we need to analyze the correlations on the 4d simplicial manifold @xmath1 .",
    "namely , we need to discuss the geometry on @xmath1 instead of the statistical properties which have been discussed until now . in order to discuss the geometry on @xmath1",
    ", we analyze the configurations of the 4d sqg coupled with @xmath2 u(1 ) gauge fields and @xmath3 massless scalar fields . the partition function @xmath4 is given as the sum of the all of the configuration of 4-simplices @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the action for the gravity , the scaler field @xmath10 on the vertex @xmath11 and the vector field @xmath12 on the link @xmath13 respectively .",
    "for the action of the gravity part , we use the discretized einstein - hilbert action , @xmath14=\\kappa_{4}n_{4}-\\kappa_{2}n_{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the number of the @xmath11-simplices , @xmath16 is related to newton s constant and @xmath17 is related to cosmological constant .",
    "the action for the scalar field @xmath10 on the vertex @xmath11 becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is number of 4-simplices sharing link @xmath20 , then , the action of vector field @xmath21 on link @xmath20 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is number of 4-simplices sharing triangle @xmath24 . in order to attempt the canonical simulation",
    ", we add the volume fixing term @xmath25 to the total action , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the parameter to fix the volume @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the size of the target volume . at @xmath30 , we take a sample of @xmath1 and attempt to measure .",
    "in order to analyze the geometry of @xmath1 , we discuss the fractal properties based on the geodesic distance with measuring the fractal dimension and the correlation functions of the additional fields .",
    "we consider some different definitions of the geodesic distance on @xmath1 .",
    "one of such the definitions is the shortest distance between two 4-simplices along the 4-simplices , so - called the simplex - simplex geodesic distance .",
    "however , we expect that the expansion of the volume along the simplex - simplex geodesic distance is restricted , since the number of 4-simplices boarding on the 4-simplex is fixed .",
    "another definition is the shortest distance between two vertices along the link , so - called the vertex - vertex geodesic distance . in order to discuss the difference between the two distances , we introduce the box - counting dimension @xmath31 on @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath0 denotes the scale of the geodesic distance",
    ", @xmath34 denotes the number of the closed - surface @xmath35 with the radius @xmath36 .",
    "the box - counting method is known as one of the standard methods to define the fractal dimension .    in figure",
    "[ fig.bc ] , we show the @xmath37 based on each geodesic distances in the case of pure gravity .",
    "the numerical results suggest that each geodesic distance need rescaling in order to be equivalent to the other definition of geodesic distance .",
    "we consider that this rescaling factor is caused by the difference of the degree of freedom of each distances on the discretized manifold . from the behavior of the box - counting dimension in the branched polymer region ,",
    "the simplex - simplex geodesic distance is the intrinsic scale and that it needs the rescaling factor for agreement with the unique shortest distance on the manifold . on the contrary",
    ", numerical results suggest that the vertex - vertex geodesic distance does nt need the extra rescaling factor and that it is close to the unique shortest distance .",
    "then , we choose the vertex - vertex geodesic distance for analysis of the geometry of @xmath38 .",
    "we analyze the correlation functions on the vertex - vertex geodesic distance instead of the conventional geodesic distance of simplex - simplex distance . in order to analyze the behavior of the correlation function",
    ", we introduce the correlation length @xmath39 for the operator @xmath40 on the vertex @xmath41 , @xmath42 this value diverges to infinity at the critical point of second order phase transition .    in figure  [ fig.col ]",
    ", we show the numerical results in the case of the pure gravity and the additional one vector field @xmath43 .",
    "the numerical result suggests that the value of @xmath39 indicates the property of manifold and the phase structure .",
    "moreover , from the finite - size - scaling of the value of @xmath39 at the critical point between the crumpled phase and smooth phase in the case of @xmath43 , @xmath39 diverges to infinity for the large @xmath28 limit .    while the divergence of @xmath39 is not found both at the critical point of the pure gravity case and at the obscure transition point between the smooth phase and the branched polymer .",
    "the numerical results suggest that the type of transition at the critical point of the additional matter case is different from the type of both the critical point of the pure gravity and the obscure transition point . actually , we found the power low behavior of the correlation functions at the critical point in the case of @xmath43 . in figure",
    "[ fig.tf_na=1 ] , we show the correlation functions for the local scalar curvature . the deviation from the power low can be considered as the finite size effect .",
    "in order to discuss the geometry on @xmath1 , we analyze the geodesic distances defined along the lattice building blocks . from the numerical result of the box - counting dimension ,",
    "the simplex - simplex geodesic distance need extra in order to be equivalent to the vertex - vertex geodesic distance .",
    "moreover , we show the behavior of the correlation function numerically .",
    "the correlation length realizes the phase diagram and its peak value diverges to the infinity at the critical point for the large @xmath28 limit .",
    "then , the numerical results of the box - counting dimension and the correlation function suggest that the massless mode propagates on the simplicial manifold which has the fractal dimension nearly 4 . in conclusion",
    ", the geometry on the simplicial manifold can be analyzed on the basis of the vertex - vertex geodesic distance ."
