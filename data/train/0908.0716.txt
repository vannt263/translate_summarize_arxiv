    "relativistic bipolar outflows , generally emitting most of their energy in the radio range , are one of the most dramatic manifestations of the presence of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "although it is widely accepted that these ejections are closely related to the accretion process onto the central black hole , the details of this link are still unknown .    a promising approach for tackling this problem is to investigate the x - ray properties of agn with jets ( generally called radio - loud agn ) and carry out a systematic comparison with their radio - quiet counterparts , the seyfert galaxies .",
    "unlike optical and uv light , x - rays are not significantly attenuated and are less affected by dilution from the host galaxy and are thought to be produced in the inner most regions of the accretion flow , thus may provide the most direct view of the central engine .",
    "broad - line radio galaxies ( hereafter blrgs ) are one of the best classes of radio - loud agn for this comparative analysis ; they have optical and uv spectral properties similar to seyfert galaxies , but they also host large - scale radio jets that are absent in their radio - quiet counterparts .",
    "past x - ray spectroscopic studies , employing , and  data , have shown that blrgs have weak  lines and weak or absent compton reflection humps at energies @xmath4  kev , a hallmark of seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , woniak et al .",
    "1998 ; sambruna et al .",
    "1999 ; eracleous et al .",
    "2000 ; zdziarski & grandi 2001 ; grandi et al .",
    "these findings have been confirmed by recent studies that made use of higher quality spectra provided by  and  ( e.g. , ballantyne et al .",
    "2004 , ballantyne 2005 ; ogle et al .",
    "2004 ; lewis et al . 2005 ; gliozzi et al .",
    "indeed , the weakness of the  line and the compton reflection continuum are very important observational clues , since they represent a major difference between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , the origin of this difference is still debated ( see gliozzi et al .",
    "2007 for a detailed discussion on the competing models ) .",
    "the importance of temporal studies lies in that they may provide model - independent information that complements the findings from spectral studies and possibly breaks the spectral degeneracy .",
    "indeed , the similarity of the temporal and spectral variability properties of 2 blrgs ( including c ) with those of seyfert galaxies , led us to rule out a jet origin for the bulk of x - ray flux from these blrgs and provided tight constraints on the jet contribution ( gliozzi et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "past temporal studies indicate that the flux variability of c  is associated with spectral variability , in the sense that the spectrum softens as the flux increases .",
    "the presence of flux and spectral variability has been observed separately in the 215 kev band with  ( gliozzi et al .",
    "2003a , 2006 ) , in the 2 - 10 kev energy band using  and _ ginga _ ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 ) , as well as at softer energies ( 0.12.4 kev ) with  ( leighly et al .",
    "importantly , all the above results , are based either on long - term ( months to years ) monitoring campaigns or on multiple observations spanning several years , but none addresses specifically the short - term variability .",
    "although in the literature there are several studies based on individual observations of c  with different x - ray satellites ( e.g. , _ exosat _ from inda et al .",
    "1994 ;  from eracleous et al . 1996 , or  from grandi et al . 1999 ) , they all are focused on the spectral analysis and the temporal analysis is generally limited to few sentences indicating that the flux appears to be constant on timescales shorter than 1 day .",
    "the apparent absence of short - term variability in cseems to be in line with scaling relations inferred from power spectral density studies of radio - quiet agn ( see mchardy et al .",
    "2006 and references therein )",
    ". however , the lack of short - term variability in this agn has never been tested by a satellite with the capabilities of , which combines a very high throughput with highly elliptical orbits .",
    "these capabilities produce high quality uninterrupted light curves that have revealed the presence of short - term variability also in unexpected agn classes , such as liners or low - luminosity seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , gliozzi et al . 2003b , 2008 ; papadakis et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "taking advantage of the unique capabilities of  we perform for the first time a thorough analysis of the temporal and spectral variability of c  on timescales of a few hours .",
    "this study is complemented by a similar analysis on timescales of 2 days , based on high quality variability data from   and from .",
    "these data are then combined with long - term  monitoring data to produce the first power spectral density ( psd ) of c. a detailed analysis of the time - averaged spectral properties is reported in a companion paper by sambruna et al .",

    "because of the well known long - term temporal and spectral variability of c , the  data can not be safely combined with the epic data for a broadband spectral analysis . nevertheless , the  observation , which has a total exposure of 80 ks spanning a 2-day interval , is useful for investigating the variability on intermediate timescales at higher energies .    the  observations ( both the new observations presented here and the older observations used for the psd analysis ) were carried out with the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; rotschild et al .",
    "1998 ) instruments . here",
    "we will consider only pca data , because the signal - to - noise ratio ( hereafter s / n ) of the hexte data is too low for a meaningful analysis .",
    "the pca data were screened according to the following acceptance criteria : the satellite was out of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) for at least 30 minutes , the earth elevation angle was @xmath19 , the offset from the nominal optical position was @xmath20 , and the parameter electron-2 was @xmath21 .",
    "the last criterion excludes data with high particle background rates in the proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",

    "all the above tasks were carried out with the help of the ` rex ` script provided by the  gof , which calls the relevant programs from the ftools v.6.5 software package and also produces response matrices and effective area curves for the specific time of the observation .",
    "data were initially extracted with 16  s time resolution and then re - binned to different bin widths for different applications . the short - term temporal analysis is restricted to pca , standard-2 mode , 215 kev , layer 1 data , because that is where the pca is best calibrated and most sensitive . for the psd study we restricted the analysis to the 210 kev energy band , since this is the common energy range for , , and .",

    "another simple way to quantify the spectral variability of c , without considering the time ordering of the values in the light curves , is based on the fractional variability parameter @xmath74 .",

    "these missing points are randomly distributed over each light curve , and we accounted for them using a linear interpolation between the two bins adjacent to the gaps , adding the appropriate poisson noise in each case .",
    "we used equation ( 1 ) in papadakis & lawrence ( 1993 ) to compute the periodograms of each light curve , after normalizing them to their mean .",

    "for example , using a 9-month light curve of c  from the  hri ( which probes the 0.12.4 kev energy band ) , leighly & obrien ( 1997 ) demonstrated that the soft x - rays are highly variable , displaying large flares with quiescent periods in between , a behavior that and implies a non - linear nature for the variability process .",
    "similarly , two long - term monitoring campaigns with , spanning respectively 3 months and 2 years , revealed that the source is highly variable also at higher x - ray energies with @xmath79 ranging between 20 and 30% ( gliozzi et al .",
    "2003a ; 2006 ) .",
    "however , since both  and  are low - earth orbit satellites the light curves were continuously interrupted , hampering the study of variability on timescales of hours .    , with its highly elliptical orbit , has allowed the study of the short - term variability of c  for the first time .",
    "the epic light curves showed a lack of any significant short - term variability , despite the fact that the source was caught in a fairly high flux state .",
    "the lack of short - term variability lends support to the scenario where the jet does not play an important role in the x - ray emission of cfrom 2 different points of view .",
    "first , it confirms on firmer statistical ground that c  follows the scaling relations typical of radio - quiet agn that predict the short - term variability to be negligible in agn with large @xmath2 .",
    "second , it reveals a marked difference with respect to the typical behavior observed in jet - dominated sources , which show strong variability down to timescales of few minutes ( e.g. , cui 2004 ) . according to the current blazar paradigm ,",
    "the observed short - term variability at high energies is a direct consequence of the small size of the emitting region and the observed variability timescales are further shortened by beaming effects : @xmath114 . as a consequence , the lack of short - term variability in c  suggests that the x - ray emitting region is extended and that the beaming effects , if present , are negligible in this energy band .",
    "the 2-day long observations carried out with  and  confirm that on timescales longer than a few hours , the x - ray emission of cvaries significantly .",
    "additionally , the analysis of  hxd - pin data suggests a possible detection of low - amplitude flux changes up to 40 kev .",
    "however , the current uncertainties on the hxd background prevent us from drawing strong conclusions .",
    "important results from the temporal study can also be derived by the psd analysis , which is the best developed timing technique and the one commonly used for investigating the time variability properties of galactic black hole systems ( gbhs ) and agn .",
    "indeed , recent detailed psd studies have been used to strengthen the link between gbhs and agn ( e.g. , uttley et al . 2002 ; markowitz et al .",
    "2003 , mchardy et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the comparison of the psd frequency break @xmath96 ( indicative of a characteristic timescale of the bh system ) in gbhs and agn has provided an alternative way to determine the bh mass in agn .",
    "mchardy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed that , in seyfert galaxies , the break timescale , @xmath115 , scales with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , following the relationship : @xmath116 , where @xmath2 is measured in units of @xmath117 , and @xmath3 in units of @xmath118 .",
    "using in the above formula @xmath119 and @xmath120 , obtained from the direct integration of the sed , we obtain that @xmath1 ranges between 60 and 234 days ( 2066 days for @xmath121 ) .",
    "interestingly , this result is consistent with the temporal break inferred from our psd analysis : @xmath0 days .",
    "mchardy and collaborators ( 2006 ) also found a tight correlation between @xmath1 and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the @xmath122 line : @xmath123 .",
    "taking into accout the uncertainties on the slope , and using the value derived from our psd analysis , @xmath124 d , the predicted fwhm(@xmath122 ) for c  ranges between @xmath68  2000 and 26,000 @xmath125 , which is fully consistent with the value of 12,700 @xmath125 derived from a time - averaged spectrum over several years ( sergeev et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the agreement between the predicted and the measured value of @xmath1 is important in two respects .",
    "first , it lends further support to the detection of the break in the psd of c. we do note that , owing to the relatively short monitoring baseline of c  ( 2 years as opposed to 510 years used in seyfert studies ) , the detection of a break is significant only at the 92% confidence level .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that this is the best estimate afforded by the current data and no improvement on the break determination will be possible in the years to come , since c  is not monitored by any x - ray satellite . second , and perhaps more important , it suggests that the flux variability properties of this blrg are indistinguishable from those of radio - quiet agn .",
    "in contrast , psd studies of the most prominent blazars , mrk  421 , mrk  501 , and pks  @xmath126 ( i.e. , jet - dominated agn that have been observed with  in long monitoring campaigns ) suggest the presence of psd breaks at frequencies that are nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the tentative break found in c , i.e. , at @xmath127 hz , or @xmath128 day ( kataoka et al . 2001 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the variability properties of c  appear to be incompatible with jet emission .",
    "on the other hand , the similarity between the variability properties of seyfert galaxies and c  psds suggests that the x - ray variability process , and by extension the x - ray emission mechanism are similar between these two classes of object .",
    "previous studies , based on  monitoring campaigns over periods ranging from a few months to two years , have revealed that cshows correlated flux and spectral variations : the source spectrum softens as the source becomes brighter ( gliozzi et al .",
    "2003a , 2006 ) , which is the typical behavior observed in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , papadakis et al .",
    "since these studies were performed in the 215 kev energy range , only our december 2005  observation can be formally compared with previous results . unfortunately , due to the short duration of that observation and the limited range of the observed flux variations ( compared to the long monitoring campaigns ) , no significant spectral variability is detected .",
    "thanks to the combination of xis0 , xis1 , and xis3 data , and their relatively low background level , the  light curves have higher s / n than  and the @xmath64-count rate plot clearly indicates that c  is consistent with the typical seyfert - like behavior over a time interval of 2 days .",
    "it is worth noting that , unlike  that covers only the hard x - ray range ,  makes it possible to probe simultaneously soft ( i.e. , e @xmath129 2 kev ) and hard energies .",
    "this is of crucial importance for blrgs that have generally complex x - ray spectra , which can not be fitted with a simple power law suggesting possible contributions from different physical components ( see , e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "for example , based on spectral variability results , kataoka et al .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed that the soft x - ray emission of 3c120 ( another archetypal blrg ) was dominated by a jet .    in this context",
    ", the fact that the  @xmath130 results are in full agreement with those obtained from an analogous analysis of long - term 215 kev  data , suggests that also at softer energies the emission is dominated by the same comptonized component as in seyfert galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is further confirmed by the fact that soft ( 0.52 kev ) and hard ( 210 kev ) count rates appear to vary in concert ( see fig",
    ". 2 right panel ) .",
    "this result does not exclude the possible presence of an additional component with constant flux ( such as some contribution from reflection ) , but it rules out the presence of a variable component , such as the beamed emission from a jet .",
    "further support for the latter conclusion comes from the spectral variability analysis of  data : soft and hard count rate appears to vary roughly in concert not only within each single  observation but also between the 2  pointings that are separated in time by 1 week and in flux by 12% . at this point , one might wonder why  with its superior throughput is unable to detect a statistical significant anti - correlation in the @xmath130 plot at a confidence level higher than @xmath67 .",
    "the reason is simply that on short timescales ( individual exposures ) count rate and @xmath64 are constant , therefore all the information from one exposure virtually collapses to a single data point . as a consequence ,",
    "the search for a negative trend in the @xmath130 plot is based on 2 data points solely .",
    "we have studied the short - term temporal and spectral variability properties of the blrg c  using , , and observations carried out between october 2004 and december 2006 .",
    "our new data were then combined with older  data obtained from long - term monitoring campaigns to investigate the psd in detail .",
    "the main findings of our analysis can be summarized as follows :    * on short timescales ( i.e. , few hours , probed by uninterrupted observations ) the flux of c  in all energy bands is consistent with the hypothesis of being constant . on longer timescales ( i.e. , considering the two  observations together or the 2-day and  coverage ) the flux variability becomes significant . *",
    "a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades in frequency suggests the presence of a break at @xmath0 days at a 92% confidence level .",
    "this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio - loud , non - jet dominated agn , after the recent results of the blrg 3c  120 from marshall et al .",
    "importantly , the time scale corresponding to the break frequency is in agreement with the relation between @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 as well as with the @xmath131 relationship , both of which are valid for seyfert galaxies .",
    "note that , while the relative brevity of the long - term  campaign hampers the significance of the break detection around 40 days , the quality of the data is sufficient to rule out the presence of a break at shorter timescales , which is typically detected in psds of jet - dominated sources . *",
    "the 2-day long  observation indicates that c  shows the typical spectral evolution of seyfert galaxies in the 0.510 kev energy range ( the spectrum becomes softer as the source brightens ) .",
    "this confirms previous results , based on long  monitoring campaigns , and expands them to different energy bands and to much shorter timescales . * the broadly coordinated variability in soft and hard x - rays during the 2-day  observation and between the 2  pointings , taken one week apart , suggests a common physical origin for both energy bands , arguing against the presence of an additional variable component ( i.e. , a jet ) emerging at softer energies . *",
    "the lack of short - term flux variability , the frequency break of the psd , and the seyfert - like spectral variability consistently argue against a scenario where a jet plays a significant role in the x - ray regime , confirming the results from the time - averaged spectral analysis ( sambruna et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "all our results indicate that the flux variability properties of c  are broadly consistent with those of radio - quiet agn , suggesting that the x - ray variability process and , by extension , the emission mechanism in c  is similar to that of seyfert galaxies .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that the weaker reflection features observed in the x - ray spectrum of 3c  390.3 are not a result of dilution by jet emission , in agreement with the conclusions of the spectral analysis of sambruna et al .",
    "if variability studies of other blrgs show similar results , then jet dilution will be disfavored as a general explanation of the weak reflection features in all blrgs as a class .",
    "of course , the jet can still influence the observed x - ray properties of blrgs by obscuring the central regions of the accretion disk or by beaming radiation away from the disk surface .",
    "the obscuration scenario has been suggested by sambruna et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and larsson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to account for the lack of reflection from the inner accretion disk in 3c  390.3 and 4c+74.26 , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , this scenario would also block from view the region of the accretion flow where the jet is formed .",
    "significant progress can be made by deep broadband observations of a large number of blrgs so as to sample a wide variety of accretion disk geometries .",
    "the variability analysis presented here shows that , as long as the jet angle to line of sight is large enough , such an investigation will not be subject to the effects of jet dilution ."
