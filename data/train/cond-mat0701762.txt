    "the control of the electron spin in nanoscale is an object of great interest in the field of spintronics.@xcite the knowledge of how the spin evolves as the electron goes through a nano - device is a key element for the purpose of using the spin degree of freedom as a mechanism for information transfer and processing .",
    "randomization of the electron spin , however , occurs due to the spin - orbit coupling as the electron wave vector changes during and after scattering processes . between scattering events , the precession frequency of the spin about the local magnetic field",

    "the fact that spins with different momentums precess with different frequencies is referred to as inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite with any spin - conserving scattering included , the inhomogeneous broadening results in spin dephasing.@xcite    for @xmath26 , @xmath49 reads    @xmath50    we find that @xmath49 includes two parts : the zeroth - order term ( on @xmath51 ) which is always along the same direction @xmath52 , and the second - order term .",

    "this is because when the spin polarization direction is the same as the direction of the effective magnetic field , the spin polarization can not precess and hence there is no inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "consequently the spin polarization has an infinite dephasing time .",
    "the same is true for the spin diffusion : when the spin polarization is along the same direction of @xmath49 , _",

    "nevertheless , in contrast to the spin dephasing in a spatially homogeneous system , the spin diffusion has an extra degree of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ , the spin diffusion / injection direction ( which should not be confused with the spin polarization direction ) . this degree of freedom introduces an additional level of anisotropy to the spin diffusion / transport . when the spin diffusion / injection direction is along @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ , ( @xmath57 ) direction , the precession frequency @xmath58 becomes @xmath59-independent if the cubic term of the dresselhaus term is neglected .",

    "( [ eq : beq2 ] ) that in this special case the oscillation period is the same for all @xmath31 s , with the value @xmath62 .",
    "so , there is no inhomogeneous broadening and the spin has an infinite diffusion length , _ regardless of the direction of the initial spin polarization_. this result is mainly induced by the peculiar precession frequency @xmath63 which is determined by the spin - orbit coupling and the diffusion velocity @xmath47 , so it can not be obtained in the spatially homogeneous case where the precession frequency is only determined by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "of course , when we include the cubic term in the spin - orbit coupling , the oscillation period becomes wave - vector dependent .",
    "this inhomogeneous broadening , then , results in a finite diffusion length .    in brief , we stress the importance of the inhomogeneous broadening caused by the diffusion term as compared to the spin dephasing in the spatially homogeneous case .",

    "one finds that the diffusion length @xmath83 decreases with the density , whereas the oscillation period @xmath84 increases with it .",
    "however , it is noted that the change observed in the oscillation period is almost negligible ( 1  % ) in contrast to the pronounced changes observed in the diffusion length ( of the order of 40  % ) .",

    "both dependences above can be again understood by the inhomogeneous broadening . unlike the results in ref .",
    "[ ] where only the dresselhaus term is considered and a very weak temperature dependence is obtained , the diffusion length here has a strong temperature dependence .",
    "this can be understood by the difference in the behavior of the inhomogeneous broadening , which is determined by the anisotropy of the precession frequency @xmath49 . in the previous case ,",
    "the zero - th order term dominates the inhomogeneous broadening which changes little with temperature and electron density .",
    "however , in the present case with @xmath26 and @xmath56 , the @xmath31-dependent zeroth - order term is always zero and the second - order term alone determines the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this term increases effectively with the temperature and with the electron density due to the increase of the average value of @xmath99 .",
    "this is the reason for the obtained marked decrease of the spin diffusion length .",
    "the oscillation period @xmath84 is determined by the @xmath31-independent zeroth - order term of @xmath49 , which is independent of the electron density and the temperature .",

    "the scale of the oscillation period is on the right hand side of the frame.,height=207 ]      we now tune the gate voltage in order to change the relative importance of the dresselhaus and the rashba terms .",

    "it is further noted that the inhomogeneous broadening term @xmath109 gives a larger effect when the spin polarization is along @xmath65 and @xmath66 than that when the spin polarization is along @xmath55 as the latter coincides with the precession axis .",
    "this explains why one obtains a larger diffusion length when the spin polarization is along @xmath86 at @xmath101 .",

    "it is shown that unlike the spin dephasing in the time domain where strong anisotropy is determined by different spin polarization , for spin diffusion it is also determined by the spin diffusion / injection direction . by neglecting the cubic term of the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling and with @xmath26 , the ideal case of an infinite diffusion length is obtained _ either _ for the spin polarization along @xmath2 regardless of the spin diffusion direction _ or _ for the spin diffusion direction along @xmath111 regardless of the spin polarization direction .",
    "however , the cubic term can not be neglected , resulting in a finite diffusion length , which in fact is small , about 2  @xmath112 m at the temperature of 200  k when the electron density lies between @xmath97  @xmath73 and @xmath96  @xmath73 .",
    "it is then shown that when @xmath26 , for the spin polarization along @xmath2 , the spin diffusion length changes little for the spin diffusion direction , whereas for the other two perpendicular spin polarization directions @xmath111 and @xmath113 , the spin diffusion length shows strong anisotropy for the spin diffusion / injection direction and has a peak when the spin diffusion / injection direction is along @xmath1 .",
    "when the spin diffusion / injection direction is along @xmath1 , the spin diffusion length is isotropic for spin polarization .",

    "<S> aiming at the optimization of the spin diffusion length in ( 001 ) gaas quantum wells , we explore the effect of the anisotropy of the spin - orbit coupling on the competition between the rashba and the dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations with the electron - phonon and the electron - electron scattering explicitly included . for identical strengths of the rashba and the dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings , the spin diffusion length shows strong anisotropy not only for the spin polarization direction but also for the spin diffusion direction . </S>",
    "<S> two special directions are used seeking for the large diffusion length : ( @xmath010 ) and ( 110 ) . without the cubic term of the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling and with the identical dresselhaus and rashba strengths , infinite diffusion lengths can be obtained _ either _ for the spin diffusion / injection direction along @xmath1 , regardless of the direction of spin polarization , _ or _ for the spin polarization along @xmath2 , regardless of the direction of the spin diffusion / injection . however , </S>",
    "<S> the cubic dresselhaus term can not be neglected , resulting in a finite spin diffusion length which decreases with the temperature and the electron density . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy for the spin diffusion direction and spin polarization direction is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> for the spin diffusion / injection direction along ( @xmath310 ) , the spin diffusion length increases first with the increase of the rashba strength ( from 0 ) which can be tuned by the external gate voltage ; when the rashba strength is slightly smaller than ( in stead of equal to ) the dresselhaus strength , the diffusion length reaches its maximum , followed by a decrease with further increase of the rashba strength . </S>"
