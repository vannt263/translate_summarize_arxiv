    "motivated by the seemingly intrinsic nature of the glassy behavior in such crystalline spin glasses , we explore a heisenberg model on a magnetic lattice realized in scgo and qs - ferrites .",
    "the magnetic lattice of interest is a triangular network of bi - pyramids that are formed by two corner - sharing tetrahedra and are connected by linking triangles ( see fig .",
    "1a , d ) . here",
    "we consider a simple nearest neighbor spin interaction hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "classically , any spin configuration in which each tetrahedron and linking triangle has a total zero spin is a ground state .",
    "there are an infinite number of energetically equivalent configurations .",
    "an important subset of these states is the set of states in which the spins in each bi - pyramid are collinear@xcite .",
    "it is well established that collinear configurations are commonly favored in frustrated magnets , which , as we will show later is also the case for the model at hand .",
    "note , in passing , that in most cases co - linearity of spin configurations is global over the entire lattice , while here the collinear direction is not global .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to such states simply as locally collinear ( lc ) states .",
    "lc states can be conveniently explored as a simple problem of two degrees of freedom : tri - color ( representing the three types of spins for the @xmath3 configuration for the afm linking triangle ) and binary sign ( representing the parallel ( + ) or anti parallel ( - ) direction of each spin within a collinear bi - pyramid of given color ( fig .",
    "the triangular network of the bi - pyramids forces the tri - color to order long range in a @xmath4 structure as shown by circles in blue , green and red in fig .",
    "there are 18 possible sign configuration per bi - pyramid , and the sign degrees of freedom are constrained to have the same sign for each linking triangle that connects each three neighboring bi - pyramids @xcite .",
    "spin liquid candidate systems , such as kagome and pyrochlore , where any spin configurations with zero spin triangles and zero spin tetrahedra , respectively , are ground states , have local zero - energy modes , involving a a finite number of spins , and thus their ground state degeneracy is extensive and scales with the volume .",
    "below , however , we give an entropic argument using a tiling approach to the absence of local - zero modes in our model .",
    "absence of such modes greatly enhances the dynamical barrier to transitions between lc states , and facilitates freezing .",
    "we map each sign state into a hexagon tile as shown in fig .",
    "the six corners of the hexagon tile represent the six spins forming the upper and the lower triangles of the bi - pyramid .",
    "the tiles are chosen to have the exact matching and enumeration properties of the sign representation ( fig .",
    "1b ) , spins on the boundary are associated with black and blue colors according to their sign .",
    "the middle spin of the bi - pyramid does not interact with other bi - pyramids , and thus we are free to choose the color of the center of the hexagon so as to create the simplest patterns that preserve the topology of the network of positive and negative spins on the boundary .    even within the subset of the lc states (",
    "sign states ) , there are numerous ways of covering the entire lattice . with the hexagon representation ,",
    "the problem of counting the number of sign states in the system becomes a tiling problem .",
    "our tiling problem seems new and bears a remote visual resemblance with a two colored piecewise herringbone tiling . in order to investigate how the degeneracy increases with the size of the system",
    ", we first identified numerically all possible sign states with varying the number of column and rows of bi - pyramids , and thus varying the size of the system .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2b , for a given column the number of the possible sign states , @xmath5 , increases with the number of rows in a slower rate than exponentially , which indicates that @xmath5 does not scale with the volume ( area in this quasi - two - dimensional case ) of the system .",
    "surprisingly , as shown in the inset , @xmath5 seems to scale with the number of bi - pyramids on the boundary , i.e. , the perimeter of the system .",
    "this behavior is corroborated by studying the number of states using transfer matrix methods , we find , numerically , that the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix corresponding to a strip of k rows , seems to decrease with k , up to 11 rows , involving 77 spins per unit length .",
    "this scaling starkly contrasts with the volume scaling of @xmath5 of the kagome and pyrochlore systems in which local zero energy modes exist .",
    "this non - extensive scaling may be viewed as a consequence of the absence of local zero energy modes .",
    "instead , the smallest unit of zero energy modes scales with the linear dimension of the system , as it involves bi - pyramids along a line , as shown in fig . 3a .",
    "the hexagon representation for the sign state of each bi - pyramid allows us to establish bounds on the number of collinear states @xmath6 for a system of volume @xmath7 and circumference @xmath8 .",
    "we find that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are constants .",
    "in particular , for @xmath11 , we have : @xmath12 , concluding that ( up to a possible logarithmic correction ) the number of states is extensive in the boundary length .",
    "the lower bound is easy to establish : for a given boundary length @xmath8 , we can construct explicitly a number of states which scales as @xmath13 .",
    "one way of doing so is by starting from one of the long - range structures as shown in fig .",
    "these structures support straight quasi one - dimensional modes that change the state of the bi - pyramid along them . for a square sample of side @xmath8",
    ", we can put up to @xmath8 independent parallel modes of this type , which supplies us with the lower bound .    to show the upper bound we recast the sign states as a tiling problem .",
    "we use the hexagonal tiles depicted in fig .",
    "1c to obtain a representation of the system as a network of lines .",
    "the resultant network may be considered as a fully packed network of rectilinear stripes of alternating color on a lattice , made of straight lines , @xmath14 degree turns ( `` elbows '' ) and junctions as shown in fig .",
    "3b . the elements generating this network yield the following properties : @xmath15 .",
    "lines can not terminate , and @xmath16 .",
    "there are no closed loops .",
    "property @xmath15 can be verified by inspection of possible termination points , and ruling each of them out . to prove property @xmath16 , assume the contrary and consider a closed loop of black color , inside there must be loops of smaller and smaller sizes .",
    "since the colors alternate , we must have an enclosed simply connected region that is entirely black or entirely blue . since we do not have an entirely blue or entirely black hexagon in our disposal ,",
    "such a region must be of limited thickness , therefore the inner region must be made of lines with termination points . by property @xmath15 , such termination points are not allowed .",
    "to proceed , we define a `` laminar region '' as a region where no junctions are present .",
    "property @xmath17 : in a laminar region , by definition , the lines are parallel ; moreover , for each of the lines parallel to a chosen reference line ( not necessarily a straight one ) , the thickness at any point along it can be deterministically inferred if the thickness at any other point is known .",
    "property @xmath17 is established by classifying all possible elbow points that do not involve a junction ( fig .",
    "3b ) . properties @xmath15 and @xmath16 imply that each line must go through the boundary .",
    "property @xmath17 , shows that in a laminar region , the thickness degree of freedom of each pattern can be pushed to the boundary , moreover , any elbow must be reflected at two points on boundary of the sample , a detailed study of these properties shows that for a laminar region we can systematically reconstruct the internal state given the boundary of the region .",
    "next , we consider junctions to show that @xmath18 for any network where @xmath19 is the number of junctions . by properties @xmath15 , @xmath16 ,",
    "the network is a graph with the only possible termination points on the boundary , and no closed circles : it is thus a forest ( disjoint union of trees ) , with leaves only on the boundary .",
    "an elementary fact of graph theory @xcite is that the number of nodes in a full binary tree can not exceed the number of leaves , therefore @xmath18 .",
    "we can have at most @xmath20 locations for placing junctions in the sample .",
    "there are a finite number of possible junction elements . once the locations and nature of the junctions have been established , the sample excluding the junction is a laminar region by definition , with effective boundary length proportional to @xmath21 , following observation @xmath17 , the state is determined by it s boundary . summing over possible numbers of junctions we have @xmath22 , which yields the aforementioned upper bound .",
    "thus we have proved that the configurational entropy of collinear states scales with its perimeter rather than its volume .",
    "let us now turn to the energetics of the sign states .",
    "among the myriad of the sign states , there are six long range ordered states where three types of sign bi - pyramids are arranged in a @xmath4 structure , one of which is the @xmath23 state shown in fig . 1d .",
    "once a sign state is constructed over the entire lattice , the corresponding lc state is constructed by imposing the color ordering . from the lc states",
    ", one can generate non - collinear coplanar bi - pyramid states ( henceforth coplanar states ) by collectively rotating each pair of antiparallel spins in each tetrahedron @xcite . in the mean - field level , the collective motions do not cost any energy , leading to an energy landscape with infinitely large flat bottom formed by collinear and coplanar state and thus to low temperature spin liquid behaviors@xcite .    to investigate what happens",
    "when quantum fluctuations are taken into account , we have calculated the energy cost of the quantum fluctuations , within the harmonic ( holstein - primakoff ) approximation around numerous classical spin configurations of minimal energy , with up to @xmath24 bi - pyramids per sample .",
    "this is done by carrying out numerically a symplectic transformation to diagonalize the resultant bosonic hamiltonians in real space for each state , without assuming long - range order .",
    "an example of the procedure is shown in fig . 4 for @xmath25 bi - pyramids with several different cdifferent lc states as local minima . since the long range ordered sign state is special , we considered the lc states near the @xmath4 @xmath23 state that are connected with each other through coplanar states .",
    "4 shows the results ; the degeneracy between the collinear and the coplanar states is also lifted , making the lc states local minima and creating energy barriers by the coplanar states .",
    "the degeneracy among the lc states is also lifted ; the @xmath4 sign state has a lower energy than the other sign states , making the @xmath4 long range ordered state a global minimum and the other lc states local minima .",
    "explicit enumeration shows that there are 6 possible @xmath4 sign states , giving 36 possible @xmath4 spin states when combined with the @xmath26 possible color configurations .",
    "thus quantum fluctuations lift the mean field ground state degeneracy to form @xmath27 global minima of the long range ordered lc states and numerous local minima of other lc states , the number of which scales with the perimeter of the system . since there are no local spin reorientations which connect between the mean field minima , the energy barriers between different states are huge . as a result , upon cooling ,",
    "the system gets trapped in one of the local minima of collinear bi - pyramids without a long - range order .",
    "the spin freezing explicitly breaks the @xmath28 invariance of our heisenberg hamiltonian . as a result of this symmetry breaking , and the finite spin stiffness for deforming the aperiodic static antiferromagnetic spin texture ,",
    "its thermodynamics at low temperatures will be governed by low - energy hydrodynamic halperin - saslow modes@xcite .",
    "such modes are linearly dispersive and lead to a @xmath29 behavior for a quasi - two - dimensional system such as ours . in conventional spin glasses",
    "where dilute magnetic ions are embedded in a nonmagnetic metal , there is also a linear in @xmath30 contribution to the specific heat due to localized two - level systems@xcite , which dominates its thermodynamics as observed experimentally@xcite . in our system , however , such a linear contribution is negligible at low doping ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , leading to a @xmath31 behavior at low temperatures , consistent with the experimentally observed behavior in scgo@xcite .",
    "the concept of a rugged energy landscape was originally proposed to explain freezing phenomenon found in classic spin glass in which dilute magnetic ions in a nonmagnetic metal interact via long range rkky interactions that change with distance between the magnetic ions and even change in sign @xcite .",
    "the random magnetic interactions induce frustration , which leads to many states of nearly identical energy and a rugged energy landscape . since then",
    ", it has also been suggested to be responsible for other quenching processes that are ubiquitous in nature , ranging from gelation @xcite to metallic glass @xcite , to protein folding @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "precise mapping of the complex energy landscape as a function of configurations and thus the microscopic mechanism for the freezing phenomena has been challenging .",
    "the triangular network of bi - pyramids , on the other hand , does not possess the problem of randomness , and thus provides a unique opportunity to microscopically determine the rugged energy landscape and study the mechanism of the spin freezing , as shown in this work .",
    "an important ingredient in our treatment was the tiling based proof that no classical local zero modes are allowed in the system .",
    "we remark that the relevance of tiling as model systems for glassy behavior has been extensively studied for glasses in the context of kcms@xcite . as dynamics",
    "is usually allowed only when vacancies in the system are present@xcite , a system that is highly packed ( or fully packed as in our discussion here ) will be `` stuck '' in a configuration for a very long time .",
    "sub - extensive entropy appears in some kcm models .",
    "for example the ising plaquette model on the square lattice exhibits a non - extensive entropy at low temperatures @xcite , in this model glassines is present on the classical level , and @xmath28 symmetry is broken on the hamiltonian level .",
    "the system is gapped , rendering trivial low temperature thermodynamics . in the context of spin - liquids ,",
    "a checkerboard model was studied@xcite , where in a valance bond solid ( vbs ) phase , bond configurations are stripe - like , and carry entropy that is extensive in boundary length .",
    "however , we note that there , individual spins have no static moment ( in fact , spin configurational entropy is extensive in volume in that model ) .",
    "a vbs state was also suggested on a structurally different but related lattice to ours , a \\{111 } slice of pyrochlore@xcite , which has also a volume scaling entropy .",
    "a nematic phase of pseudo - spin was explored in s=1 kagome antiferromagnet with a strong single ion anisotropy @xcite which is realized without a static spin moment .",
    "finally , we note that similar exotic entropy scaling has been of great interest in other branches of physics , from cosmology , where the entropy of black holes has been argued by bekenstein and hawking to scale as the boundary area @xcite , to more recently , in many body quantum mechanical model systems at zero temperature .",
    "for example , boundary extensive ground state degeneracy is a feature of some supersymmetric lattice models@xcite .",
    "a related phenomena is the scaling of entanglement entropy with the boundary area for free scalar fields @xcite , that obtains logarithmic corrections when a fermi surface is present @xcite . in our case",
    "the perimeter scaling entropy is due to the fact that the local minima of the energy landscape are not separated by local spin rotations ( which would typically result in an extensive entropy ) , but rather are connected with each other by a continuous extended collective rotations of spins , which are sensitive to the states on the boundary",

    ".    _ proof of property 2 : _ to prove this , assume the contrary and consider a closed loop of black color , inside there must be loops of smaller and smaller sizes . since the colors alternate , we must have inside an enclosed simply connected region which is entirely black or entirely blue . as we do nt have a an all blue or all black hexagon , therefore the inner region",
    "must be made of lines with termination points . by property 1",
    ", this can not happen .",
    "* definition : * _ `` laminar region''_.    a laminar region is a region where lines do not split ( i.e. there are no junctions ) .",
    "property 3 :    the network in a laminar region is a set of black and blue pipes ( not necessarily straight ) , which are parallel to each other .",
    "moreover , the thickness of each pipes is determined by the thickness at any given point along the pipe .",
    "_ proof of property 3 : _ if no junctions are present , since the lines are fully packed and can not cross or join , the arrangement is of parallel curves .",
    "we now inspect the thickness of the curves .",
    "since the thickness is constant along straight segments , we have to consider elbows ( corners ) .",
    "there is only a finite number of possible elbows , which can be checked explicitly .",
    "we find that at a corner without a junction , the thickness of a pipe is switched deterministically from thin to thick and vise versa .",
    "thus , given the thickness of the pipe , and the set of points where it has changed direction , the thickness is determined all along the pipe .",
    "an example of a corner is in figure [ corner ] .",
    "a simple example of laminar regions are the 1 - 6 - 8 states , as well as it s variants involving a spaghetti exhibited in the figures above .        in a laminar region ,",
    "property 3 leads to the following immediate estimate of the number of possible states in a region bound by a curve of length @xmath8 . choosing a reference black curve of length @xmath8",
    ", we can specify the thicknesses of @xmath5 of its parallel pipes .",
    "the area @xmath34 of such a configuration is @xmath35 , and the number of possibilities involved is bounded above by @xmath36 : at each point on the reference curve we can either stay straight or make a @xmath37 degree turn left or right , in addition , we have @xmath38 choices of the thicknesses of the parallel curves .",
    "remark : this , of course is a large over - estimate , since the reference curve can not self intersect , moreover , it s shape is highly restricted by properties 1,2 , which applies to it as well as all the parallel curves .    finally , we show that given the configuration of tiles a boundary layer of a thickness 3 hexagons of a laminar region , the state can be completely determined . to see this , note that to establish the state we have to determine the locations of the elbows , as well as the thickness of the lines .",
    "the thicknesses are always determined at the boundary . for each internal elbow",
    ", it s image will appear on the boundary of the region in at least two points ( as it can not disappear going from one line to the next ) .",
    "if we determine a layer of the boundary thick enough to detect all possible elbows , which can be done with a boundary of thickness 3 , we can continue to determine the internal state using the information on the thickness of the lines at the boundary .",
    "by the arguments above , the number of laminar regions scales as the boundary length . to complete our bound on the total number of states",
    ", we must include junctions .",
    "there are several kinds of junctions .",
    "most involve a narrow and wide lines meeting .",
    "in addition there is a triple narrow junction type ( fig .",
    "[ nnnjunction ] ) .",
    "all junctions of valence larger than 3 may be viewed as joining of two valence 3 junctions .",
    "we now bound the number @xmath19 of possible junctions in the sample .",
    "this can be done by a simple argument : by properties 1,2 , the system is a set of lines with no closed cycles , and termination points only on the boundary . such a system may be viewed as a graph consisting of a disjoint union of trees with leaves on the boundary .",
    "since the number of vertices on a full tree is always smaller then the number of trees we have that : @xmath39 for each configuration of junctions , we can consider the system consisting of the boundary and a small region around the junctions as a laminar region .",
    "the effective boundary degrees of freedom are less than @xmath40 , where the constant @xmath41 describes the `` thickening '' needed to observe elbows , as before",
    ". therefore we have at most : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are binomial coefficients , and @xmath44 .",
    "we can easily bound the last equation using @xmath45 and get : @xmath46 for a typical @xmath47 , and we have : @xmath48",
    "in this section we show how locally colinear states may be counted using a transfer matrix method .",
    "while we get fairly quickly an upper bound on the number of states , it is extensive in system volume .",
    "however , numerics shows that this seems like a large over - estimate : the numerical behavior is quite peculiar and is consistent with a boundary entropy .",
    "let us consider a description of this problem as follows .",
    "we consider a square array of the bi - pyramids . it may be viewed as alternating two zig - zag columns which are shifted with respect to each other vertically .",
    "we enumerate the possible signs a long the zig - zag columns as follows .",
    "we consider adding another column in two steps : we first add sites at even levels and then the sites at odd level as depicted in the fig [ twosteps ] .        in this procedure all the sites in the first stage",
    "can be added independently of each other , and after it is complete the second stage shares this property .",
    "we are now left with the task of transferring this into a formula . for a bi - pyramids in the first move",
    ", we note that the signs @xmath49 and in general @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an integer , remain unchanged .",
    "the sites which might change after the move are of the form @xmath52 .",
    "each such pair only depends on the states of @xmath53 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 the number of possible sign states with the signs on the left @xmath53 and sites on the right : @xmath55 .",
    "we can view this as a linear transformation @xmath56 on @xmath57 @xmath58 for a column of @xmath59 bi - pyramids , there are @xmath60 signs on the border which participate in the counting . in the first stage",
    "we can combine all the @xmath61 moves to @xmath62 next we note that the transformation governing the added bi - pyramids in step 2 , is described in the same , albeit shifted by two sites .",
    "in addition , it involves adding boundary bi - pyramids , which require special counting .",
    "we can summarize this as : @xmath63 for @xmath64 columns , the number of states may now be computed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 specify boundary conditions on the left and on the right .",
    "now , the number of states in a large region , @xmath67 scales as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath70 .",
    "next we consider the eigenvalues of @xmath71 and @xmath72 separately .",
    "assuming @xmath59 is large , these are determined by @xmath61 .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 is special , and it s eigenvalues can be determined analytically .",
    "to do so we first determine the invariant subspaces of this matrix .",
    "@xmath61 is a @xmath73 matrix , acting on 4 ising spins .",
    "it turns out more convenient to write it using two double spins , in basis 4 by assigning : @xmath74 we now find the cycles of the matrix : @xmath75    interestingly , the 6 largest eigenvalues are @xmath76 , each doubly degenerate . here",
    "the largest eigenvalue is @xmath77 is the golden ratio . by the norm inequality : @xmath78 , we immediately conclude that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath72 and of @xmath71 scale as @xmath79 . from this",
    "we have a rough estimate that the number of states scales at most as @xmath80 .",
    "the largest eigenvalues of transfer matrices can be computed numerically up to several rows . here",
    "are the two largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath81 up to 11 rows : @xmath82    @xmath83    it is very clear that , at least up to 11 rows , the largest eigenvalue goes down .",
    "this means , that for a long enough strip , the number of states of 11 rows , will be smaller than , say the number of states of 3 rows .",
    "this reflects the highly constrained nature of the system : for certain sign configuration of the 3 rows , there can be no way to continue adding rows in a consistent way up to 11 rows .",
    "the decreasing nature the eigenvalues give us strong evidence that , in fact , the number of states should scale as the boundary length , without an extra @xmath84 .",
    "for one bi - pyramid , a coplanar state can be generated from a collinear state by rotating the 7 spins in several collective ways , four of which with a set of parameters @xmath85 are shown in fig .",

    "we consider the hamiltonian : @xmath86 first we pick a classical spin configuration which is a local energy minimum . in the next step",
    "we take each classical spin direction , and replace by an operator as : @xmath87 where @xmath88 are boson creation / annihilation operators , and @xmath89 are any couple of unit vectors which combine into an orthogonal frame with the classical direction @xmath90 . at this point , in order to get a tractable theory , the square roots are expanded to lowest order in @xmath91 .",
    "since it is assumed that the spin is at a classical minimum , this procedure yields a quadratic hamiltonian in the bosonic operators .",
    "uniform ( long range ordered states ) are studied , as usual , by rewriting the hamiltonian in momentum space . the number of degrees of freedom , is then determined simply by the unit size .",
