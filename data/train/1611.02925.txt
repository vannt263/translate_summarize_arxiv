    "constructing classical states that satisfy some local constraints everywhere on a lattice may be a difficult problem .",
    "the simplest physical examples of such problems include dimer coverings of lattices , perfect tilings of a surface with tiles of special geometry , coloring sites with distinct colors , folding paper ( origami ) .",
    "they have in common that they can be formulated with ice - type or vertex models .",
    "the calculation of the number of states and the thermodynamics is difficult , but has been solved exactly in some cases .",
    "there are also interesting issues regarding conservation laws in the dynamics and hidden higher symmetries .",
    "a way to construct numerically such constrained states is to iterate a dynamical process , starting from a simple state .",
    "in particular , classical monte - carlo algorithms sample the ensemble of states by flipping variables collectively in order to preserve the constraints,@xcite either along loops@xcite or in clusters of sites.@xcite there are now examples of models where such algorithms are nonergodic , and conservation laws may hinder classes of states . this is the case of some dimer models on lattices in three spatial dimensions , where the nonergodicity is restricted to flipping the smallest loops.@xcite this is also generically the case when periodic boundary conditions create sectors characterized by winding numbers : here again the ergodicity is simply restored by including in the dynamics the loops that wind accross the boundaries .",
    "a different example is given by the three - color baxter s model@xcite that we will consider here .",
    "in this model , the constraint consists of coloring the edges of a regular hexagonal lattice with three colors such that no two neighbors have the same color .",
    "baxter calculated exactly the entropy of the three - colorings for a hexagonal lattice with open boundary conditions . in order to compute some observables , loop monte - carlo algorithms",
    "have been set up but it has been recognized that they are nonergodic for lattices with periodic boundary conditions,@xcite possibly leading to systematic errors . in particular , some states that are not connected by the dynamics , have been constructed on finite - size systems , leading to the conclusion that there are more than one class of states.@xcite since this property is intimately related to the topology of the two - dimensional lattice , an alternative monte - carlo approach@xcite is to use other geometries for the boundaries , such as a plane with open boundary conditions ( but it suffers from more finite - size effects ) or a `` projective plane '' , although the hexagonal lattice has some noncubic vertices in this case .    restricting to standard periodic boundary conditions and studying why this dynamics in particular is nonergodic is nevertheless interesting , as a point of principle .",
    "this dynamics is not only used in monte - carlo algorithms but also in quantum models constructed from these constrained states ( see refs .   in the coloring context ) .",
    "nonergodicity is generally related to some conservation laws ( or broken symmetries ) which may have some consequences in various problems .",
    "it is also used in applications , _",
    "e.g. _ as bits , and some proposals emphasized the advantage of the topological nature of the ergodicity breaking in dimer models.@xcite even though imposing periodic boundary conditions seems to be an `` academic '' problem -they are not that of crystals- , it is , in principle , possible to ( i ) design artificial superconducting or magnetic devices with special geometry of the boundaries,@xcite ( ii ) consider molecular nanomagnets that realize special topologies , _",
    "e.g. _ a sphere or a ring in the `` keplerate '' family.@xcite another close model is the three - coloring model with an additional achiral constraint on the states which generates an infinite number of sectors , even when winding loops are allowed to flip.@xcite    in the absence of ergodic algorithms to construct all states , simple properties such as the number of missed states are not known . is this number extensive with the system size or not ? if it is , what is the entropy of the new class ?",
    "given a state , how do we know whether it is connected to a simple reference state of a given class , _",
    "i.e. _ what is the reason of the obstruction to ergodicity ? can we construct an ergodic algorithm that will visit all states ?",
    "we answer these questions in the present paper .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the model in section [ model ] , and we construct all three - coloring states on small clusters in section [ enumeration ] , from dimer coverings .",
    "we check the numbers of three - colorings by using the method of transfer matrix in section [ tmc ] . in section [ dyn ] , we study the dynamics of loops .",
    "in addition to standard winding - number classes which we recall ( [ winding ] ) , we find some other invariant classes under the winding loops ( [ kempe ] ) . we identify a conserved quantity which is the parity of the total chirality ( [ chirality ] ) and briefly discuss some other sectors ( [ symm ] and [ special ] ) .",
    "we then enumerate separatly odd and even states by appropriate transfer matrices , which allow to extract entropies of infinitely - long strips ( section [ oddeventm ] ) .",
    "we introduce a monte - carlo dynamics that does not conserve the parity in section [ ergodic ] , and compute the fraction of odd states extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit and the order - parameter in section [ results ] . in appendix",
    "[ appa ] , in order to check the construction of section [ enumeration ] , we recall the method of pfaffians to enumerate dimer coverings , and give the actual numbers of configurations",
    ". it also allows to discuss a general invariant of dimer coverings ( appendix [ invariantdimer ] ) , which in turn is useful to define another formulation of the parity ( appendix [ alternatives ] ) .",
    "the appendix [ sm ] treats the same problem where the toroidal boundary condition is replaced by a klein bottle geometry , leading to similar conclusions .",
    "we consider the model of color variables @xmath1 defined on the edges @xmath2 of a regular honeycomb lattice ( sites of the kagome lattice ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the three edges meeting at each vertex must be in different colors : this local constraint defines the 3-color baxter s model.@xcite each state is referred as a `` 3-coloring '' of the lattice . the number of valid configurations , _",
    "i.e. _ respecting the constraints everywhere scales as @xmath3 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath4).@xcite    in the following , the model is defined on finite - size clusters with two different shapes , the rhombus ( r ) and hexagonal ( h ) shapes shown in figs .",
    "[ honlatt ] and [ hexlatt ] .",
    "we also consider two different boundary conditions , realizing the topology of the `` torus '' ( see the arrows in fig .",
    "[ honlatt ] ) or of the `` klein bottle '' ( appendix [ sm ] ) .",
    "both surfaces have zero euler characteristic and regular hexagonal lattices fit without introducing noncubic vertices .",
    "the exhaustive construction of states satisfying the constraints everywhere is possible numerically only on very small clusters , since the number of states increases exponentially with the system size . for this",
    ", we first construct the dimer coverings of the lattice by filling an empty lattice with dimers , and checking the constraints at each step.@xcite once a dimer covering is obtained , each vertex has one edge ( out of three ) occupied by a dimer -this edge is called color a. the other two edges form a closed loop of even length ( on the clusters with periodic boundary conditions we have considered ) , which is filled with b and c ( or c and b ) alternatively ( see fig.[honlatt ] for an example ) .",
    "the dimer configuration has @xmath5 such nonintersecting closed loops , which define @xmath6 colorings .",
    "note that we obtain all 3-colorings in this way since any of them can explicitly be decomposed in a dimer configuration ( the a colors ) plus a loop configuration .",
    "it is numerically more efficient than enforcing the color constraint on every vertex . by constructing all dimer coverings , we compute the partition function , @xmath7 and the number of three - colorings , @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the number of loops of the dimer configuration @xmath9 . in this form , @xmath10 is also the partition function of the o(2 ) fully packed loop model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the table [ table1 ] gives the numbers @xmath11 and @xmath10 for the torus boundary conditions , obtained by the explicit construction of individual states as explained above .",
    "@xmath10 is a multiple of six , since the six color permutations of the first edge are equivalent , while @xmath11 is a multiple of three only for the torus , where the three edge directions are equivalent .",
    "as a first check , the entropy per site for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , differs from baxter s thermodynamic limit , @xmath14,@xcite by a typical @xmath15 correction , as expected . in order to check these numbers more carefully , we have calculated @xmath11 exactly on finite - size systems by using the method of pfaffians ( details are given in appendix [ appa ] ) .",
    "while no closed form is known for @xmath10 on finite - size systems and the method of pfaffians is not applicable , we have used a numerical transfer matrix method that we explain now .",
    ".number of dimer coverings , @xmath11 , and 3-colorings , @xmath10 , for system size @xmath16 ( linear size @xmath17 ) and periodic boundary conditions of the `` torus '' geometry .",
    "r / h stands for rhombus / hexagonal shapes shown in figs .  [ honlatt ] and [ hexlatt ] .",
    "@xmath11 is also calculated from pfaffians in appendix [ hexper ] and [ rhombtorus ] , @xmath10 from transfer matrix in table [ tabletm1 ] for the rhombus geometry . [",
