    "as we will see , the reason for the ( modest ) underestimation is that in the numerical flow there are correlations left at the largest length scales .",
    "for @xmath64 we find poor agreement between the curve evaluated from equation ( [ eq6b ] ) and the numerically obtained values , see figure [ batchelor_data ] .",
    "the reason is that at @xmath65 there still is considerable correlation @xmath66 .",
    "more precisely , at the maximal meaningful distance @xmath67 when employing periodic boundary conditions , namely , when @xmath12 equals half of the periodicity length ( here , @xmath68 ) , we find @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 , or @xmath72 . therefore , @xmath73 is smaller and @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 , which is the value the structure functions would take for perfect decorrelation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "geometrically , the above correlations mean that there is an eddy with diameter @xmath78 in the numerical flow .",
    "the possibility of such large eddies is a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions ( in contrast to boundary conditions which put the velocity to zero at the edge of the flow volume ) and will also survive for larger @xmath58 .",
    "such a large scale eddy implies that the flow is _ not _ isotropic and homogeneous at the large scales and therefore it should be no surprise that equation ( [ eq6b ] ) , whose derivation requires isotropy and homogeneity , does not lead to good agreement with the data at large scales . note that the same problem occurs in experimental flow ,",

    "@xcite is down to @xmath90 , whereas here we only have a @xmath25 resolution and the deviations in the structure functions due to the lower end of the resolution may influence the scaling exponents in a certain range of larger scales .",
    "our next point is to advocate _ compensated _ ess plots for the visualization of intermittency effects .",
    "already meneveau @xcite  see figure 1 of that paper  reveals how misleading an ess plot @xmath91 vs @xmath83 can be . here",

    "better scaling than in figure [ ess_d2_stern ] .",
    "the reason is that in the vsr the scaling exponent is @xmath93 for trivial reasons , a value which can hardly be distinguished by eye from the isr value @xmath94 . to avoid this similarity of the vsr and isr exponents , we prefer to use compensated ess plots @xcite .",

    "ess is thus useful already for the simple reason that a transition from a local slope of 2/3 to roughly 0.70 is _",
    "shorter _ than from a local slope 2 to roughly 0.70 .",

    "( 0.5,0.5 )    as we will show now , there is no extended scaling regime towards scales much smaller than order @xmath97 , either , if one does ess type plots with @xmath13 instead of @xmath83 .",

    "( [ bat ] ) of @xmath84 for various @xmath21 , see figure [ ess_d2_bat ] .",
    "we observe three regimes : the vsr without any scaling corrections ( i.e. , a horizontal line in figure [ ess_d2_bat ] ) , a crossover regime , corresponding to the range from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , and only for large scales and large @xmath101 the isr scaling corrections @xmath102 can be identified .",
    "to summarize this subsection : there seems to be ess towards large scales , if the structure functions plotted against each other are both calculated with the moduli , i.e. , have the same large scale saturation behavior .",
    "in particular , for the third order longitudinal structure function this means that it is essential to take @xmath83 rather than @xmath13 and to clearly distinguish between the @xmath103 and @xmath104 exponents .",
    "this was already stressed by stolovitzky and sreenivasan @xcite , see in particular their figures 2 and 4 where they compare local slopes of @xmath105 vs.  @xmath13 and @xmath83 .",
    "the natural question to ask is : is there also ess for odd order structure functions ( calculated _ without _ the modulus ) plotted against each other ? in figure [ fig_odd]b we plot @xmath106 vs @xmath107 .",
    "no ess towards large scales is seen .",
    "it seems that odd and even order moments obey fundamentally different types of statistics .",

    "@xcite ; however , for the flow analyzed in that references the @xmath103 for odd @xmath108 are _ larger _ than expected from the extrapolation .",

    ", we can not exclude that there is more universality in _ decaying _ turbulence where less anisotropy through the forcing and the boundaries is felt .",
    "next , we focus on the difference in the scaling between longitudinal and transversal structure functions , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively . recently , different degrees of intermittency for longitudinal and transversal fluctuations were reported in some experiments @xcite and numerical simulations on decaying turbulence @xcite . we confirmed these findings for statistically stationary turbulence @xcite ( see also ref .",

    ". however , figure [ ess_tdl_bat]a seems to imply different scaling of @xmath29 and @xmath64 .",
    "the reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the argument of equal scaling of @xmath29 and @xmath64 is only valid if both structure functions scale individually .",
    "this is not the case in the transition ranges or if there is not any isr yet . here ,",
    "the reynolds number achieved in the full simulation is by far too small to give the asymptotic ( isr ) scaling . in figure",

    "for @xmath125 there is a fake scaling law with an apparent exponent of @xmath126 , which has nothing to do with inertial range scaling .",

    "the latter bends down .",
    "again , only for @xmath4 the asymptotic scaling exponent @xmath132 starts to be observable .    the same finite @xmath58 effects which we discussed for the 2nd order structure functions , where @xmath84 and @xmath133 are _ known _ to have the same scaling , will _ hinder _ to determine scaling exponents vs @xmath12 ( or vs @xmath13 ) in higher order structure functions for too low @xmath134 .",
