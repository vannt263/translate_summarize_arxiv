    "emission lines of he - like ions have been widely observed from a variety of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas .",
    "for example , lines of many he - like ions detected in solar plasmas at x - ray wavelengths ( 150 @xmath2 ) have been listed by dere _ et al _ @xcite , and in the regions 170211 @xmath2 and 245291 @xmath2 by feldman _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "similarly , transitions from these ions have been observed in laboratory plasmas @xcite  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the resonance ( @xmath3 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6 ",
    "1s2p @xmath5p@xmath7 ) , intercombination ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6  1s2p @xmath10p@xmath11 ) , and forbidden ( @xmath12 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath13 ",
    "1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 ) lines , which are highly useful for plasma diagnostics  see , for example , @xcite  @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , to analyse observations , atomic data are required for a variety of parameters , such as energy levels , radiative rates ( @xmath15- values ) , and excitation rates or equivalently the effective collision strengths ( @xmath16 ) , which are obtained from the electron impact collision strengths ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these data are also required for the modelling of fusion plasmas @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a series of papers we have already reported atomic data for he - like ions up to @xmath18=30 @xcite  @xcite and for @xmath18=36 , i.e. kr xxxv @xcite . in this work",
    "we report similar data for the remaining five ions with 31 @xmath19 35 , i.e. ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv .    the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) have compiled and critically evaluated energy levels for many he - like ions , and have posted data on their website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm .",
    "additionally , the @xmath15- value for the 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6  1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 ( 12 ) magnetic dipole transition of ga xxx is available on the nist website .",
    "however , no collisional data are available in the literature for the ions under consideration . therefore ,",
    "in this paper we report a complete set of results ( namely energy levels , radiative rates , lifetimes , and effective collision strengths ) for all transitions among the lowest 49 fine - structure levels of these he - like ions , which belong to the 1s@xmath4 , 1s2@xmath20 , 1s3@xmath20 , 1s4@xmath20 and 1s5@xmath20 configurations .",
    "finally , we also provide the @xmath15- values for four types of transitions , namely electric dipole ( e1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole ( m1 ) and magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) , as these are required in a complete plasma model .    for our calculations we employ the fully relativistic grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) code for the determination of wavefunctions , originally developed by grant _",
    "et al _ @xcite and subsequently revised by several workers , under the names grasp @xcite , grasp92 @xcite , and grasp2k @xcite . however , the version adopted here is grasp0 , which is based on @xcite and is revised by dr p h norrington .",
    "this version contains most of the modifications undertaken in the other revised codes and is available on the website http://web.am.qub.ac.uk / darc/. grasp is a fully relativistic code , and is based on the @xmath21 coupling scheme .",
    "further relativistic corrections arising from the breit interaction and qed effects ( vacuum polarization and lamb shift ) have also been included in the same way as in the original version described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have used the option of _ extended average level _ ( eal ) , in which a weighted ( proportional to 2@xmath22 + 1 ) trace of the hamiltonian matrix is minimized .",
    "this produces a compromise set of orbitals describing closely lying states with moderate accuracy . for our calculations of @xmath17",
    ", we have adopted the _",
    "dirac atomic @xmath1-matrix code _ ( darc ) of p h norrington and i p grant ( http://web.am.qub.ac.uk/darc/ ) .",
    "however , the code does not include the breit and qed corrections , and hence the target energies obtained are slightly different ( and comparatively less accurate ) than from grasp .",
    "finally , for comparison purposes we have performed parallel calculations with the _ flexible atomic code _",
    "( fac ) of gu @xcite , available from the website .",
    "this is also a fully relativistic code which provides a variety of atomic parameters , and ( generally ) yields results for energy levels and radiative rates comparable to grasp ",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite , and references therein . however , the differences in collision strengths and subsequently in effective collision strengths between fac and darc can be large , particularly for forbidden transitions , as demonstrated in our earlier papers @xcite@xcite , and also discussed below in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "hence results from fac will be helpful in assessing the accuracy of our energy levels and radiative rates , and in estimating the contribution of resonances to effective collision strengths , included in calculations with darc but not in fac .",
    "the 1s@xmath4 , 1s2@xmath20 , 1s3@xmath20 , 1s4@xmath20 and 1s5@xmath20 configurations of he - like ions give rise to the lowest 49 levels listed in table 1 ( a  e ) , in which we compare our level energies with grasp ( obtained _ without _ and _ with _ the inclusion of breit and qed effects ) with the critically evaluated data compiled by nist . also included in these tables are our results obtained from the fac code ( fac1 ) , including the same ci ( configuration interaction ) as in grasp .",
    "our level energies obtained without the breit and qed effects ( grasp1 ) are consistently higher than the nist values by up to @xmath23 1.7 ryd , similar to the effect observed for other he - like ions @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the orderings are nearly the same as those of nist .",
    "the inclusion of breit and qed effects ( grasp2 ) lowers the energies by a maximum of @xmath23 1.9 ryd , depending on the ion .",
    "as expected , the contribution of breit and qed effects increases with increasing @xmath18 , but our grasp2 energies are lower than the nist listings by up to @xmath23 0.4 ryd , depending on the ion .",
    "in addition , the orderings have slightly altered in a few instances , see for example the 4f and 5f levels .",
    "however , the energy differences between these swapped levels are very small . it may be noted that nist compilations are mostly based on a variety of theoretical works resulting in small differences with our listed energies .",
    "our fac1 level energies are consistently higher by up to 0.2 ryd than the grasp2 results , for all ions , and hence are comparatively in better agreement with the nist listings .",
    "the level orderings from fac1 are also in general agreement with the calculations from grasp , but differ in some instances , particularly for the @xmath24 = 5 levels .",
    "this is mainly because the non - degeneracy among the levels of the @xmath24 = 5 configurations is very small .",
    "a further inclusion of the 1s6@xmath20 configurations , labelled fac2 calculations in table 1 ( a  e ) , makes no appreciable difference either in the magnitude or orderings of the levels .",
    "finally , in table 1 ( a  e ) we also list the energies of whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which are obtained with the _ autostructure _ ( as ) code of badnell @xcite , and are available at the apap ( atomic processes for astrophysical plasmas ) website : .",
    "the as energies are higher by up to @xmath23 2 ryd , depending on the ion , than the corresponding reference values from nist and our results from the fac and grasp codes . differences between the nist and our theoretical energy levels with the latter calculations increase with increasing @xmath18 , and are due to the higher - order relativistic effects being neglected in the as calculations .",
    "more importantly , the level orderings are slightly different , particularly for levels 42 and higher , and the as energies for some of the levels of the 5 g configuration are non - degenerate .",
    "however , the energy differences among the levels of a configuration are very small , as noted above . to conclude",
    ", we may state that overall there is general agreement between our calculations with the fac and grasp codes for the energy levels of the he - like ions considered here , and there is no major discrepancy with the nist listings .",
    "however , the nist energies are not available for some levels , particularly of the @xmath24 = 5 configurations , for which our energy levels either from the grasp2 or fac1 calculations should be adopted in modelling applications . for the remaining levels ,",
    "the critically compiled listings of nist may be preferred .",
    "the absorption oscillator strength ( @xmath25 ) and radiative rate @xmath26 ( in s@xmath27 ) for a transition @xmath28 are related by the following expression :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , @xmath32 is the velocity of light , @xmath33 is the transition energy / wavelength in @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the lower ( @xmath37 ) and upper ( @xmath22 ) levels , respectively .",
    "similarly , the oscillator strength @xmath25 ( dimensionless ) and the line strength @xmath38 ( in atomic unit , 1 a.u .",
    "= 6.460@xmath3910@xmath40 cm@xmath4 esu@xmath4 ) are related by the standard equations given below .",
    "for the electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions    @xmath42    for the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions    @xmath43    for the electric quadrupole ( e2 ) transitions",
    "@xmath44    and for the magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) transitions    @xmath45    in table 2 ( a  e ) we present transition energies / wavelengths ( @xmath46 , in @xmath34 ) , radiative rates ( @xmath26 , in s@xmath27 ) , oscillator strengths ( @xmath25 , dimensionless ) , and line strengths ( @xmath38 , in a.u . ) , in length form ( babushkin gauge ) only , for all 336 electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions among the 49 levels of the he - like ions considered here .",
    "the _ indices _ used to represent the lower and upper levels of a transition have already been defined in table 1 ( a  e ) .",
    "similarly , there are 391 electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , 316 magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and 410 magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) transitions among the 49 levels . however , for these transitions only the @xmath15-values are listed in table 2 , and the corresponding results for the @xmath47- or @xmath38- values can be easily obtained using eqs .",
    "( 15 ) .",
    "as stated earlier , no other @xmath15-values are available in the literature with which to compare our results .",
    "therefore , we have performed another calculation with the fac code of gu @xcite . for all strong transitions ( f @xmath48 0.01 ) , the @xmath15-values from grasp and fac , in the babushkin gauge , agree to better than 10% for the five ions .",
    "furthermore , for a majority of the strong e1 transitions ( f @xmath48 0.01 ) the length and velocity ( coulomb gauge ) forms in our grasp calculations agree within 10% . however , the differences are larger for a few transitions , which are among the degenerate levels of a configuration , such as 1011 ( @xmath49 1.4@xmath3910@xmath50 ) , 2425 ( @xmath49 8.5@xmath3910@xmath51 ) and 2729 ( @xmath49 1.9@xmath3910@xmath52 ) in ga xxx .",
    "this is because their transition energy ( @xmath53 ) is very small and hence a slight variation in @xmath53 has a considerable effect on the @xmath15-values .",
    "for a few such weaker transitions ( @xmath54 10@xmath55 ) the two forms of the @xmath47- value differ by orders of magnitude , for all ions . finally , as for the energy levels the effect of additional ci is negligible on the @xmath15- values , as results for all transitions agree within 10% with those obtained with the inclusion of the @xmath24 = 6 configurations .",
    "therefore , for almost all strong e1 transitions our radiative rates should be accurate to better than 10% .",
    "however , for a few weaker transitions the accuracy is comparatively lower .",
    "the lifetime @xmath56 for a level @xmath22 is defined as follows :    @xmath57    since this is a measurable parameter , it provides a check on the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "therefore , in table 1 ( a  e ) we have also listed our calculated lifetimes , which include the contributions from four types of transitions , i.e. e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 . unfortunately to our knowledge",
    "no similar theoretical or experimental data are available with which to compare our results .",
    "however , based on the accuracy assessment of our @xmath15- values , we expect our lifetimes to have the same level of accuracy .",
    "collision strengths ( @xmath17 ) are related to the more commonly known collision cross section ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) by the following relationship :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the incident energy of the electron and @xmath35 is the statistical weight of the initial state .",
    "results for collisional data are preferred in the form of @xmath17 because it is a symmetric and dimensionless quantity .    for the computation of collision strengths @xmath17",
    ", we have employed the _ dirac atomic @xmath1-matrix code _ ( darc ) , which includes the relativistic effects in a systematic way , in both the target description and the scattering model .",
    "it is based on the @xmath21 coupling scheme , and uses the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian in the @xmath1-matrix approach .",
    "the @xmath1-matrix radii adopted for ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv are 2.88 , 2.72 , 2.56 , 2.40 and 2.24 au , respectively .",
    "for all five ions , 60 continuum orbitals have been included for each channel angular momentum in the expansion of the wavefunction , allowing us to compute @xmath17 up to an energy of 2150 , 2350 , 2650 , 3000 and 3400 ryd for ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv , respectively .",
    "these energy ranges are sufficient to calculate values of effective collision strengths @xmath16 ( see section 6 ) up to t@xmath62 = 10@xmath0 k , appropriate for applications to the modelling of high temperature laboratory plasmas .",
    "the maximum number of channels for a partial wave is 217 , and the corresponding size of the hamiltonian matrix is 13 076 . to obtain convergence of @xmath17 for all transitions and at all energies",
    ", we have included all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath63 40.5 , although a larger number would have been preferable for the convergence of some allowed transitions , especially at higher energies .",
    "however , to account for higher neglected partial waves , we have included a top - up , based on the coulomb - bethe approximation @xcite for allowed transitions and geometric series for others .    for illustration , in figs .",
    "13 we show the variation of @xmath17 with angular momentum @xmath64 for three transitions of ga xxx , namely 25 ( 1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 ",
    "1s2p @xmath10p@xmath65 ) , 211 ( 1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14  1s3p @xmath10p@xmath65 ) , and 912 ( 1s3p @xmath10p@xmath66  1s3p @xmath10p@xmath67 ) , and at three energies of 1000 , 1400 and 1800 ryd .",
    "values of @xmath17 have fully converged for all _ resonance _ transitions ( including the allowed ones ) , plus a majority of the allowed transitions among the higher excited levels , as shown in fig . 2 for the 211 transition .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "2 that the need to include a larger range of partial waves increases with increasing energy .",
    "however , values of @xmath17 have not converged for those allowed transitions whose @xmath53 is very small ( mainly within the same @xmath24 complex ) , as shown for the 25 transition in fig .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath17 have ( almost ) converged for all forbidden transitions , including those whose @xmath53 is very small , such as the 912 transition shown in fig .",
    "3 . therefore",
    ", for the allowed transitions within the same @xmath24 complex , our wide range of partial waves is not sufficient for the convergence of @xmath17 , for which a top - up has been included as mentioned above , and has been found to be appreciable .    in table 3 ( a  e ) we list our values of @xmath17 for resonance transitions of ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv at energies _ above _ thresholds . the indices used to represent the levels of a transition have already been defined in table 1 ( a  e ) .",
    "unfortunately , no similar data are available for comparison purposes as already stated in section 1 .",
    "therefore , to assess the accuracy of @xmath17 , we have performed another calculation using the fac code of gu @xcite .",
    "this code is also fully relativistic , and is based on the well - known and widely - used _ distorted - wave _ ( dw ) method .",
    "furthermore , the same ci is included in fac as in the calculations from darc .",
    "therefore , also included in table 3 ( a  e ) for comparison purposes are the @xmath17 values from fac at a single _ excited _ energy e@xmath68 , which corresponds to an incident energy of @xmath23 2000 , 2100 , 2300 , 2400 and 2600 ryd for ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv , respectively . for a majority of transitions",
    "the two sets of @xmath17 generally agree well ( within @xmath23 20% ) . however , the differences are larger for a few ( particularly weaker ) transitions . for example , for 70% of the ga xxx transitions , the values of @xmath17 agree to within 20% at an energy of 2000 ryd , and the discrepancies for others are mostly within a factor of two , although for some transitions ( such as : 1949 , 3338/41/43/47/49 ) , the differences are up to an order of magnitude . however , most of these transitions are weak ( @xmath69 10@xmath51 ) and forbidden , i.e. the values of @xmath17 have fully converged at _ all _ energies within our adopted range of partial waves in the calculations from the darc code . for such weak transitions , values of @xmath17 from the fac code",
    "are not assessed to be accurate .",
    "the values of @xmath17 are higher from darc for some transitions , whereas for others are higher from the fac code .",
    "additionally , for a few transitions , such as 1828/29/30/31 , values of @xmath17 from the fac code show an anomalous behaviour towards the higher end of the energy range .",
    "this problem is common for all ions and examples can be seen in fig .",
    "6 of aggarwal and keenan @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the sudden anomalous behaviour in values of @xmath17 from the fac code is also responsible for the differences noted above for some of the transitions .",
    "such anomalies for some transitions ( both allowed and forbidden ) from the fac calculations arise primarily because of the interpolation and extrapolation techniques employed in the code , which is designed to generate a large amount of atomic data in a comparatively very short period of time , and without too large loss of accuracy .",
    "similarly , some differences in @xmath17 are expected because the dw method generally overestimates the results due to the exclusion of channel coupling .",
    "such discrepancies , for a similar number of transitions , have also been noted for ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv .    as a further comparison between the darc and fac values of @xmath17 , in fig .",
    "4 we show the variation of @xmath17 with energy for three _ allowed _ transitions among the excited levels of ga xxx , namely 514 ( 1s2p @xmath10p@xmath65 - 1s3d @xmath10d@xmath70 ) , 1226 ( 1s3p @xmath10p@xmath67 - 1s4d @xmath10d@xmath71 ) , and 1527 ( 1s3p @xmath5p@xmath65 - 1s4d @xmath5d@xmath70 ) . also included in this figure are the corresponding results obtained with the fac code . for many transitions",
    "there are no discrepancies between the @xmath47- values obtained with the two different codes ( grasp and fac ) , and therefore the values of @xmath17 also agree to better than 20% .",
    "however , the values of @xmath17 obtained with fac are underestimated in comparison to our calculations with darc , particularly towards the lower end of the energy range .",
    "similar comparisons between the two calculations with darc and fac are shown in fig . 5 for three _ forbidden _ transitions of ga xxx , namely 28 ( 1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 - 1s3s @xmath10s@xmath14 ) , 216 ( 1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 - 1s3d @xmath10d@xmath71 ) , and 612 ( 1s2p @xmath10p@xmath67 - 1s3p @xmath10p@xmath67 ) .",
    "as in the case of allowed transitions , for these forbidden ones the agreement between the two calculations improves considerably with increasing energy , but the differences are significant towards the lower end of the energy range , as @xmath17 from fac are underestimated .",
    "these anomalies are due to the interpolation and extrapolation techniques employed in the fac code , as stated above .",
    "therefore , on the basis of these and other comparisons discussed above , collision strengths from the fac code are not assessed to be very accurate , over the entire energy range , for a majority of transitions for the above named five he - like ions .",
    "however , we do not see any apparent deficiency in our darc calculations for @xmath17 , and estimate our results to be accurate to better than 20% for a majority of the ( strong ) transitions .",
    "excitation rates , in addition to energy levels and radiative rates , are required for plasma modelling , and are determined from the collision strengths ( @xmath17 ) . since the threshold energy region is dominated by numerous closed - channel ( feshbach ) resonances , values of @xmath17 need to be calculated in a fine energy mesh to accurately account for their contribution .",
    "furthermore , in a plasma electrons have a wide distribution of velocities , and therefore values of @xmath17 are generally averaged over a _",
    "maxwellian _ distribution as follows :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is boltzmann constant , t@xmath62 is electron temperature in k , and @xmath74 is the electron energy with respect to the final ( excited ) state . once the value of @xmath16 is known the corresponding results for the excitation @xmath75 and de - excitation @xmath76 rates can be easily obtained from the following equations :    @xmath77    and @xmath78 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the initial ( @xmath37 ) and final ( @xmath22 ) states , respectively , and @xmath79 is the transition energy .",
    "the contribution of resonances may enhance the values of @xmath16 over those of the background collision strengths ( @xmath80 ) , especially for the forbidden transitions , by up to an order of magnitude ( or even more ) depending on the transition , and particularly at low temperatures .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath17 need to be calculated over a wide energy range ( above thresholds ) in order to obtain convergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( 8) , as demonstrated in fig . 7 of aggarwal and keenan @xcite .    to delineate resonances , we have performed our calculations of @xmath17 at up to @xmath23 127 500 energies in the thresholds region , depending on the ion . close to thresholds ( @xmath230.1 ryd above a threshold )",
    "the energy mesh is 0.001 ryd , and away from thresholds is 0.002 ryd .",
    "thus care has been taken to include as many resonances as possible , and with as fine a resolution as is computationally feasible .",
    "the density and importance of resonances can be appreciated from figs .",
    "69 , where we plot @xmath17 as a function of energy in the thresholds region for the four most important transitions of he - like ions , namely 12 ( @xmath12 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6  1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 ) , 15 ( @xmath9 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6 ",
    "1s2p @xmath10p@xmath65 ) , 16 ( @xmath8 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6  1s2p @xmath10p@xmath67 ) , and 17 ( @xmath3 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6  1s2p @xmath5p@xmath65 ) .",
    "resonances shown in these figures are for transitions in ga xxx , but similar dense resonances have been noted for all he - like ions .",
    "for some transitions , such as 12 , 15 and 16 , the resonances are dense , particularly at energies just above the thresholds , and are spread over a wide energy range of @xmath23 150 ryd .",
    "these near - threshold resonances affect the values of @xmath16 particularly towards the lower end of the temperature range .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath16 are listed in table 4 ( a  e ) over a wide temperature range up to 10@xmath0 k , suitable for applications in a variety of plasmas . as stated in section 1 ,",
    "there are no other results available with which to compare .",
    "therefore , we have also calculated values of @xmath16 from our non - resonant @xmath17 data obtained with the fac code .",
    "these calculations are particularly helpful in providing an estimate of the importance of resonances in the determination of excitation rates . in table 4",
    "( a  e ) we have included these results from fac at the lowest and the highest calculated temperatures for ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv .",
    "however , for discussion we focus solely on transitions in ga xxx . at t@xmath62",
    "= 10@xmath81 k , our resonance - resolved values of @xmath16 are higher by over 20% for about 37% of the transitions .",
    "generally , the differences for a majority of the transitions are within a factor of two , but are up to a factor of five for a few .",
    "furthermore , for a majority of transitions the @xmath16 values from the darc code are higher , partly due to the inclusion of resonances in the calculations with darc but also because of the underestimation of @xmath17 at lower energies in the fac calculations , as demonstrated in figs . 4 and 5 and discussed in section 5 . in the case of the most important @xmath3 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath12 lines , resonances have significantly enhanced the values of @xmath16 , by about a factor of 2.5 , for the @xmath12 ( 12 : 1s@xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6 ",
    "1s2s @xmath10s@xmath14 ) transition .",
    "a similar comparison at the highest temperature of our calculations , i.e. 10@xmath82 k , indicates that about 39% of the transitions in ga xxx show differences of over 20% between the darc and fac values for @xmath16 .",
    "these differences are generally within a factor of two , but are higher ( up to an order of magnitude ) for a few , such as : 1828 ( allowed transition ) and 1829/30/31 ( forbidden ) . for all such transitions the fac results are _ higher _ , mainly because of the sudden anomalies in the values of @xmath17 , as discussed in section 5 .",
    "similar differences in @xmath16 are noted for a comparable number of transitions in the other he - like ions , as shown in table 4 ( a  e ) .",
    "et al _ @xcite have undertaken semi - relativistic calculations for ar xvii and fe xxv , using the standard @xmath1-matrix code of berrington _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "recently they have placed their results for @xmath16 for he - like ions up to @xmath18 = 36 on the apap website : . in their calculations",
    "electron exchange was included for partial waves up to @xmath64 = 10.5 , but was neglected for higher @xmath64 values .",
    "furthermore , the calculations were performed in the @xmath83 coupling scheme and the corresponding results for @xmath17 and subsequently @xmath16 for fine - structure transitions obtained using their intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) method .",
    "however , the data obtained by such procedures are generally comparable with our fully relativistic results from the darc code , as has already been demonstrated in several papers ",
    "see for example , liang and badnell @xcite .",
    "furthermore , whiteford _",
    "et al _ included the effect of radiation damping .",
    "this can reduce the contribution of resonances to the determination of @xmath16 for some transitions , such as 1s2p @xmath5p@xmath65 ",
    "1s3s @xmath5s@xmath6 , particularly towards the lower end of the temperature range ( see their fig .",
    "however , at temperatures relevant to plasma modelling the effect is negligible .",
    "radiation damping may be significant for highly charged ions , because radiative decay rates are large and compete with autoionisation rates @xcite@xcite . however , similar @xmath1-matrix calculations performed by delahaye _",
    "@xcite for several he - like ions up to @xmath18 = 20 , with the inclusion of radiation damping , show that their contribution ( i.e. reduction in values of @xmath16 ) is appreciable only at lower temperatures ( below 10@xmath84 k ) , which should not be important in plasma modelling applications for such highly ionised species .",
    "this has also been confirmed in calculations by whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who have shown that the resultant uncertainties in the excited level populations for the important @xmath3 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 lines of ar xvii and fe xxv , at appropriate temperatures and densities , are under 10% .",
    "finally , in a comparatively more recent calculations for fe xxv and kr xxxv using the the darc code , griffin and ballance @xcite have concluded that the damping effect on excitation to the vast majority of levels for both ions is small .",
    "specifically , the differences between the two sets of calculations ( with and without damping ) when averaged over six temperatures ranging from 1.25@xmath3910@xmath84 to 3.12@xmath3910@xmath85 k for the lowest 30 resonance transitions are only 4% for fe xxv and 4.4% for kr xxxv .",
    "similarly , the corresponding differences for all 1176 transitions over a wider range of nine temperatures are only 1.1% and 1.3% , for the respective ions .",
    "these differences are much smaller than the errors introduced by other parameters , such as inadequacies of partial waves , configuration interaction , energy mesh , and inclusion of a limited energy range .",
    "we can therefore confidently conclude that radiation damping is not important for the he - like ions considered here .",
    "we now compare our results of @xmath16 with those of whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and for illustration focus only on transitions in ga xxx .",
    "differences between the two sets of results are quite significant ( over 20% ) for many transitions , and throughout the temperature range of the calculations . to be specific , at the lowest common temperature of 1.8@xmath3910@xmath86 k , the two sets of @xmath16 differ by over 20% for @xmath2335% of the transitions .",
    "for a majority of transitions , these differences are within a factor of two , and for some our results are higher whereas for most the reverse is true . however , for a few transitions the differences are up to a factor of five , and for the ` elastic ' transitions , such as : 1416/17 , 1617 , 2324/26/27 , and 2426/27 , the discrepancies are up to two orders of magnitude , with the @xmath16 values of whiteford _ et al _ being invariably higher .",
    "most of these belong to the degenerate levels of a state / configuration , and hence have very small transition energies .",
    "to demonstrate the differences between the two calculations , in fig .",
    "10 we compare values of @xmath16 for three transitions of ga xxx , namely 1416 ( 1s3d @xmath10d@xmath87 ",
    "1s3d @xmath10d@xmath88 ) , 1617 ( 1s3d @xmath10d@xmath88 ",
    "1s3d @xmath5d@xmath87 ) , and 2426 ( 1s4d @xmath10d@xmath87  1s4d @xmath10d@xmath88 ) .",
    "the differences in the @xmath16 values are _ not _ due to resonances , but arise from the limitation of the approach adopted by whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite , as recently discussed and demonstrated by bautista _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "similar large discrepancies are also observed with the calculations of whiteford _",
    "@xcite for transitions in li - like ions , as discussed and demonstrated by aggarwal and keenan @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the problem in the @xmath1-matrix code adopted by whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite,@xcite has been identified and rectified by liang and badnell @xcite . however , since the calculations of whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite,@xcite were performed more than a decade ago , limitations in their data for he - like ions remain .",
    "differences between our data for @xmath16 from darc and those of whiteford _",
    "et al _ @xcite are not confined to lower temperatures , but cover the entire range of temperatures .",
    "for example , at the highest common temperature of 4.5@xmath3910@xmath89 k , the two sets of @xmath16 differ by over 20% for @xmath2313% of the transitions of ga xxx .",
    "hence , there is comparatively a better convergence of the results at higher temperatures , but the @xmath16 values of whiteford _",
    "et al _ are invariably higher .",
    "the differences for most transitions are within a factor of two , but for some are up to an order of magnitude , such as : 1943/45 , 2931 and 3343/45 , and all transitions with the lower levels i @xmath48 46 .",
    "most of these transitions are _ forbidden _ and @xmath17 for these have _ converged _ within our adopted partial waves range , as discussed in section 5 . to demonstrate the differences , in fig .",
    "11 we compare our results of @xmath16 from darc with those of whiteford _ et al _",
    "@xcite for three transitions of ga xxx , namely 4648 ( 1s5 g @xmath10g@xmath71 ",
    "1s5 g @xmath10g@xmath90 ) , 4748 ( 1s5 g @xmath10g@xmath91 ",
    "1s5 g @xmath10g@xmath90 ) and 4849 ( 1s5 g @xmath10g@xmath92 ",
    "1s5 g @xmath5g@xmath93 ) .",
    "since the collision strengths of whiteford _ et al _ are overestimated for many transitions , particularly at the lower energies , the corresponding results for @xmath16 are affected throughout the entire temperature range . to conclude",
    ", we may state that the @xmath16 results of whiteford _",
    "@xcite for transitions in ga xxx and other he - like ions should not be as accurate as those presented here .",
    "in this paper we have presented results for energy levels and radiative rates for four types of transitions ( e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 ) among the lowest 49 levels of ga xxx , ge xxxi , as xxxii , se xxxiii and br xxxiv belonging to the @xmath94 5 configurations .",
    "additionally , lifetimes for all the calculated levels have been reported , although unfortunately no other theoretical or experimental results are available with which to compare .",
    "furthermore , based on a variety of comparisons among various calculations with the grasp and fac codes , our data for radiative rates , oscillator strengths , line strengths , and lifetimes are judged to be accurate to better than 10% for a majority of the strong transitions ( levels ) .",
    "similarly , the accuracy of our results for collision strengths and effective collision strengths is estimated to be better than 20% for most transitions .",
    "we have considered a large range of partial waves to achieve convergence of @xmath17 at all energies , included a wide energy range to accurately calculate values of @xmath16 up to t@xmath62 = 10@xmath0 k , and resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh to account for their contributions .",
    "hence we see no apparent deficiency in our reported results .",
    "however , the present data for effective collision strengths for transitions involving the levels of the @xmath24 = 5 configurations may be improved slightly by the inclusion of the levels of the @xmath24 = 6 configurations .",
    "we believe the present set of complete results for radiative and excitation rates for transitions in five he - like ions should be useful for the modelling of a variety of plasmas .",
