    "entanglement detection in bipartite continuous - variable ( cv ) systems has typically been achieved using one out of several entanglement criteria involving measurement of two canonically conjugated variables , such as position and momentum .",
    "these criteria are usually cast in terms of the variance @xcite , covariance matrix @xcite or entropy @xcite of global variables , defined as linear combinations of the local variables .    in principle , bipartite separable quantum states can be perfectly correlated in one basis .",
    "however , this perfect correlation implies that there is no correlation in the conjugate basis .",
    "entangled quantum states , on the other hand , can be well correlated in both global position and global momentum variables .",
    "the seminal example is the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state , which as originally proposed is a simultaneous eigenstate of the relative position ( @xmath0 ) and total momentum ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "of course it is possible to investigate quantum correlations in variables other than position and momentum .",
    "for example , using dimensionless @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one can consider rotated ( dimensionless ) operators of the form @xmath4    using superscripts 1 and 2 to refer to the two parts of the bipartite system , it is well known that the epr state is an eigenstate of the relative coordinate @xmath5 when @xmath6 is an integer multiple of @xmath7 , and an eigenstate of the sum coordinate @xmath8 when @xmath6 is an odd multiple of @xmath9 . in the context of transverse spatial correlations of photon pairs ,",

    "@xcite , where the variances of canonically conjugate @xmath10 and @xmath11 were chosen such that @xmath12 .",
    "however , as will be discussed in the next section , it is not necessary to perform measurements satisfying this restriction .    the sets of eigenstates corresponding to canonically conjugate variables are examples of _ mutually unbiased bases _ ( mubs ) @xcite .",
    "this means that , if a quantum system is an eigenstate of the observable ",
    "say@xmath13 , then the probability distribution of the state with respect to the conjugate observable @xmath14 is uniform . in other words ,",
    "the precise knowledge of the state in one basis corresponds to complete ignorance in the conjugate basis .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in more detail below , any two cv operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the form given in eq . , with @xmath17 define a pair of mubs . though it may have been known for some time that any pair of bases composed of the eigenstates of non - parallel ( or non - antiparallel ) phase space operators are mubs , to our knowledge weigert and wilkinson @xcite were the first to show that one can define up to three mubs in the phase space of one cv bosonic mode .    in this work",

    "the two down - converted beams were separated at a 50/50 beam splitter and each directed by mirrors and lenses to holoeye pluto phase - only spatial light modulators ( slm ) , which were used to perform position correlation measurements by scanning a phase slit in the transverse profile of the beams , as described in ref .",
