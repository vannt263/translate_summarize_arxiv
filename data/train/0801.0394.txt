    "a central topic in graph theory is that of giving conditions under which a graph is hamiltonian .",
    "one such result is the classical theorem of dirac  @xcite , which states that any graph on @xmath2 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath3 contains a hamilton cycle . for an analogue in directed graphs",
    "it is natural to consider the _ minimum semi - degree  @xmath4 _ of a digraph @xmath0 , which is the minimum of its minimum outdegree  @xmath5 and its minimum indegree  @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding result is a theorem of ghouila - houri @xcite , which states that any digraph on @xmath7 vertices with minimum semi - degree at least @xmath3 contains a hamilton cycle .",
    "( when referring to paths and cycles in directed graphs we always mean that these are directed , without mentioning this explicitly . )",
    "both of these results are best possible .    in 1979",
    "thomassen @xcite raised the natural corresponding question of determining the minimum semi - degree that forces a hamilton cycle in an _ oriented graph _",
    "( i.e.  in a directed graph that can be obtained from a ( simple ) undirected graph by orienting its edges ) . over the years",
    "since the question was posed , a series of improving bounds were obtained in @xcite .",
    "recently , kelly , khn and osthus  @xcite were able to obtain an approximate solution .",
    "they proved that an oriented graph on @xmath7 vertices with minimum semi - degree at least @xmath8 has a hamilton cycle , which asymptotically matches a lower bound given by hggkvist @xcite . in this paper",
    "we obtain the following result which exactly matches the lower bound of hggkvist , thus answering thomassen s question for large oriented graphs .",
    "[ main ] there exists a number @xmath9 so that any oriented graph @xmath0 on @xmath10 vertices with minimum semi - degree @xmath11 contains a hamilton cycle .",

    "( to verify this , note that in a regular tournament , all in- and outdegrees are equal to @xmath13 .",
    "we can then greedily remove hamilton cycles as long as the degrees satisfy the condition in theorem  [ main ] . ) this is a slight improvement on the @xmath14 bound obtained in  @xcite by the same argument .",
    "it is the best bound so far towards the classical conjecture of kelly  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which states that every regular tournament on  @xmath7 vertices can be partitioned into  @xmath13 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "hggkvist  @xcite also made the following conjecture which is closely related to theorem  [ main ] .",
    "given an oriented graph  @xmath0 , let  @xmath15 denote the minimum degree of  @xmath0 ( i.e.  the minimum number of edges incident to a vertex ) and set @xmath16 .",
    "hggkvist conjectured that if @xmath17 , then @xmath0 has a hamilton cycle .",
    "( note that this conjecture does not quite imply theorem  [ main ] as it results in a marginally greater minimum semi - degree condition . ) in  @xcite , this conjecture was verified approximately , i.e.  if @xmath18 , then @xmath0 has a hamilton cycle .",
    "it seems possible that our approach can be extended to obtain an exact solution to this problem , but this would certainly require some additional ideas beyond those applied here .",
    "our argument can be extended to find a cycle of any length  @xmath19 , with @xmath20 ( say ) through any given vertex .",
    "we indicate the necessary modifications to the proof in the final paragraph , the details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this result is used in  @xcite to obtain the following pancyclicity result : any sufficiently large oriented graph  @xmath0 with @xmath21 contains a cycle of length @xmath19 for all @xmath22 . for @xmath23 , it even contains a cycle of length @xmath19 through a given vertex .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains some basic notation . in section  3",
    "we describe the extremal example showing that theorem [ main ] is best possible .",
    "we set up our main tools in section  4 , these being a digraph form of the regularity lemma due to alon and shapira @xcite and the blow - up lemma , both in the original form of komls , srkzy and szemerdi  @xcite and in a recent stronger and more technical form due to csaba  @xcite .",
    "our argument uses the stability method , and so falls naturally into two cases , according to whether or not our given oriented graph @xmath0 is structurally similar to the extremal example described in section  3 . in section  5",
    "we prove a lemma that enables us to find a hamilton cycle when @xmath0 is not structurally similar to the extremal example .",

    "if @xmath24 was in @xmath58 we have decreased @xmath855 by @xmath56 or @xmath873 , whereas by claim  2.5 we will make at most @xmath754 such reassignments of vertices @xmath885 .",
    "similarly , suppose there is a bad vertex @xmath886 with @xmath881 or @xmath880 .",
    "if we also have @xmath879 or @xmath884 , then by reassigning  @xmath24 to  @xmath73 it becomes good .",
    "if not , then @xmath887 , and so @xmath888 . in this case",
    "we can reassign @xmath24 to  @xmath48 .",
    "again , if @xmath24 was in @xmath58 we have decreased @xmath855 by @xmath56 or @xmath873 , whereas by claim  2.5 we will make at most @xmath754 such reassignments of vertices @xmath889 .",
    "the above cases cover all possibilities of a vertex being bad . if during this process @xmath890 and @xmath891 become equal we can apply claim  2.4 to find a hamilton cycle . alternatively",
    ", it may happen that @xmath855 goes from @xmath892 to @xmath893 if a vertex @xmath24 is moved from @xmath58 to @xmath73 . in this case",
    "we claim that we can put @xmath24 into @xmath38 or @xmath48 to achieve the following property : every vertex except @xmath24 is acceptable , there is at least one acceptable edge going into @xmath24 and at least one acceptable edge coming out of @xmath24 .    to see this , suppose first that one of @xmath894 or @xmath895 is non - empty .",
    "if one of @xmath896 or @xmath897 is also non - empty we can put @xmath24 into  @xmath38 .",
    "otherwise @xmath898 and @xmath899 are both non - empty .",
    "now we can put @xmath24 into  @xmath48 unless @xmath900 and @xmath901 are both empty , which can not happen , as then @xmath24 would not have been a bad vertex of @xmath58 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath894 and @xmath895 are both empty , so @xmath900 and @xmath901 are both non - empty .",
    "we can put @xmath24 into  @xmath48 unless @xmath898 and @xmath899 are both empty .",
    "but this implies that  @xmath24 satisfies the property @xmath902 .",
    "this can not happen , as then @xmath24 would have been reassigned to @xmath73 as a cyclic vertex in claim  2.3 .",
    "therefore we can apply the ` moreover ' part of claim  2.4 to find a hamilton cycle .",
    "but since we are assuming there is no hamilton cycle the process must terminate with an assignment of vertices where all vertices are good .",
    "let @xmath160 be a maximum matching consisting of edges in @xmath903 .",
    "say that @xmath904 matches @xmath905 with @xmath906 , that @xmath907 is a matching on @xmath908 , that @xmath909 matches @xmath910 with @xmath911 and that @xmath912 matches @xmath913 with @xmath914 .",
    "note that @xmath915 .",
    "we must have @xmath916 .",
    "otherwise , by a similar argument to that in claim 2.5 we could extend @xmath917 edges @xmath918 of @xmath160 to @xmath855 vertex disjoint paths @xmath871 , where @xmath815 includes @xmath919 , starts and ends at cyclic vertices @xmath872 , @xmath866 in @xmath58 , and uses two more vertices from @xmath58 than from @xmath73",
    ". then we would find a hamilton cycle as in claim 2.5 , which would be a contradiction .",
    "we will first prove that @xmath920 .",
    "assume to the contrary that @xmath922 .",
    "let @xmath923 , @xmath924 and @xmath925 . by the maximality of @xmath160",
    "there are no edges from @xmath926 to @xmath927 or from @xmath926 to @xmath928 .",
    "since all vertices are good this implies @xmath929 similarly @xmath930 .",
    "so by considering the average indegree of the vertices in @xmath38 we can find a vertex @xmath41 such that @xmath931 also , we can obtain @xmath932 in a similar way as  ( [ eac ] ) .",
    "so by averaging , we can find a vertex @xmath933 with @xmath934 by the maximality of  @xmath160 , every edge in @xmath58 is incident with a vertex of @xmath935 .",
    "together with the fact that every vertex is good , this implies that @xmath936 so we can find @xmath80 with @xmath937 now we use the minimum semi - degree condition and the above inequalities to get @xmath938 substituting @xmath939 and simplifying gives @xmath940 .",
    "combining this gives @xmath941 , which is only possible if @xmath920 .",
    "now  ( [ b - d ] ) immediately implies the claim .",
    "note that @xmath920 implies that @xmath942 .",
    "so by averaging , there is a vertex @xmath301 with @xmath943 . since @xmath920 also implies that @xmath944 and @xmath945 there is vertex @xmath933 with @xmath946 and a vertex @xmath80 with @xmath947 .",
    "so as in  ( [ dadcdb ] ) , using @xmath948 we obtain that @xmath949 which is impossible . this contradiction to our initial assumption on @xmath0 completes the proof .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , the proof can be modified to find a cycle of any given length  @xmath19 through any given vertex  @xmath629 of  @xmath0 , where @xmath20 , say .",
    "we give an outline of the necessary modifications here , the details can be found in  @xcite . in case  1 , we find the cycle as follows : consider a random subset @xmath950 of @xmath951 vertices of  @xmath952 obtained by choosing @xmath953 vertices from each cluster @xmath152 . with high probability ,",
    "the oriented subgraph @xmath954 induced by @xmath955 also has @xmath188 as a reduced oriented graph ( with slightly worse parameters ) .",
    "thus lemma  [ cyclelemma ] implies that @xmath954 contains a hamilton cycle .",
    "so suppose we are in case  2 .",
    "the only significant difference in the argument is in the application of the blow - up lemma in the proof of claim  2.4 .",
    "after contracting paths so that all vertices are now acceptable and @xmath800 , we then find a single path @xmath956 which contains all the vertices which correspond to contracted paths and also contains  @xmath629 .",
    "we then apply the blow - up lemma to find a path @xmath957 which ( i ) contains all but @xmath958 of the remaining vertices , ( ii ) whose initial vertex lies in the outneighbourhood of the final vertex of @xmath956 and ( iii ) whose final",
    "vertex lies in the inneighbourhood of the initial vertex of  @xmath956",
