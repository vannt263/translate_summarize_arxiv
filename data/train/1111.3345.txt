    "theoretical studies of electronic structure of disordered systems composed by ions and electrons are of great interest for understanding of dense - plasma radiative transfer and equation of state ( eos ) @xcite . in astrophysics ,",
    "eos of plasma mixtures is essential for stellar pulsation calculations , via pressure modes ( requiring sound velocity given by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to matter density ) or via gravity modes , highly sensitive to the temperature at the star center .",
    "moreover , eos has an impact on the photo - absorption cross - sections , which determine temperature distribution inside the star .",
    "such eos studies concern atoms in extreme conditions of density and temperature , which implies existence of multicharged ions close to local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "an ion configuration is defined by sub - shells ( orbitals ) occupied by an integer number of bound electrons .",
    "for example @xmath0 is a configuration consisting of six sub - shells containing respectively 2 , 2 , 5 , 1 , 3 and 2 electron(s ) . in our model ,",
    "the nucleus is totally screened by bound and free electrons in a sphere ( ion - sphere model ) which is usually named , refering to solid - state physics , a wigner - seitz ( ws ) sphere . throughout the paper ,",
    "the term `` element '' means `` element of the periodic table '' ( chemical element ) : h , he , li , be , b , c , @xmath1 .    in the usual so - called ideal - gas mixing rule ,",
    "the electronic structure of each element is calculated separately and a mixture is obtained by simply including all the individual elements at fixed temperature with their abundances .",
    "there are also other ways to treat mixtures , for instance in the framework of orbital - free molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "the present model relies on the idea that at the lte conditions , all ionic species shall be considered at the same plasma electronic environment ( free electron `` bath '' ) . in section [ sec1 ] , we show that , provided that ions of different charges have different volumes , the electronic pressure , calculated together with ionic volumes in a self - consistent way , must be equal for each ion of each element .",
    "comparisons with chemical - picture @xcite and average - atom mixture models @xcite in the case of a co@xmath2 plasma are presented in section [ sec2 ] . in the same section , values of pressure at the sun center",
    "are compared with the results of opal physical - picture model @xcite and quantum langevin molecular dynamics ( qlmd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "atoms in a plasma can be idealized by an average atom confined in a wigner - seitz ( ws ) sphere , which radius @xmath3 is related to matter density .",
    "the electronic pressure @xmath4 @xcite consists of three contributions , @xmath5 , where the bound- and free- electron pressures , respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are evaluated using the stress - tensor formula    @xmath8,\\ ] ]    @xmath9 representing the radial part of the wavefunction @xmath10 ( corresponding to energy @xmath11 ) multiplied by @xmath12 , @xmath13 the rest - mass energy of the electron and @xmath14 the orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the fermi - dirac distribution :    @xmath16    @xmath17 being the chemical potential . for bound states , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and for free states , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the choice of the boundary conditions plays a major role in the pressure value .",
    "this comes from the fact that the energy of an orbital depends on the value of the corresponding wavefunction at the boundary of the ws sphere . in our model",
    ", the bound wavefunction behaves like a decreasing exponential at the boundary .",
    "@xmath22 is the exchange - correlation pressure evaluated in the local density approximation using the formulas of ichimaru _ et al .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is used to separate the thermodynamic functions into electronic and ionic components .",
    "the total pressure can be written @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ionic pressure , calculated according to @xcite ( ideal gas with one - component - plasma corrections ) .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of a configuration provides the potential , the electron populations of the orbitals and the free - electron chemical potential @xmath17 , resulting from the neutrality of the plasma .    in the plasma",
    ", all ions should have the same electronic environment .",
    "all configurations of the same charge are grouped together and constitute an ion .",
    "normalization of configuration probabilities ( @xmath25 associated to lagrange multiplier @xmath26 ) and preservation of total volume ( @xmath27 associated to lagrange multiplier @xmath28 ) must be ensured .",

    "( [ press1 ] ) mean @xcite that all configurations have the same pressure and that it is necessary to consider enthalpy instead of the free energy . in practical , all pressures are calculated in a self - consistent way and equalized by a multi - dimensional newton - raphson method .",
    "the average value of thermodynamic quantity @xmath33 for ion @xmath34 of element @xmath35 and its probability @xmath36 are given by :    @xmath37    where @xmath31 and @xmath38 represent respectively the probability and the value of quantity @xmath39 for configuration @xmath40 .",
    "the average value @xmath41 of a quantity @xmath39 thus reads :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the number of elements in the plasma and @xmath44 the number of charge states of element @xmath35 . in the present work , pressure equality means the equality of the stress - tensor pressure at the boundary of all ionic spheres .",
    "similarly to the single - element case @xcite , it is convenient to write the system of equations in the following form : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath1 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath1 , @xmath50 , @xmath1 , @xmath51 , @xmath1 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents pressure at the boundary of ion @xmath54 of element @xmath35 .",
    "the partial density of this ion is @xmath55 and the index @xmath34 varies from @xmath56 to @xmath44 .",
    "the closure relation of the system is the matter conservation law    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the matter density of the plasma and @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent respectively the atomic mass and the mass fraction of element @xmath35 .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows , in the case of a co@xmath2 plasma at a density of 0.1 g/@xmath62 @xcite , that the atomic radii of carbon and oxygen exhibit a non - monotonic variation with the temperature .",
    "this is the signature of the shell structure , absent from thomas - fermi model @xcite .",
    "the competition between the ionization of the two atoms can be seen very clearly .",
    "one can find that there are two main structures around 10 and 50 ev , respectively .",
    "the first increase of the carbon radius around 10 ev is due to the ionization of the l shell ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 orbitals ) . for oxygen",
    ", this occurs later due to the fact that the binding energies are higher than for carbon .",
    "the second increase of radii , around 50 ev , is due do the ionization of the k shell ( @xmath65 orbital ) which is ionized more rapidly for carbon than for oxygen .",
    "the radii obtained from the average - atom mixture model of yuan @xcite differ from ours mainly at low temperatures .",
    "total pressures are compared with the values of potekhin and chabrier @xcite for three different temperatures in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "the electron pressure predicted by our model is 1.4 mbar and the total pressure 2.43 mbar ( if ions are treated as a pure ideal gas ) and 2.46 mbar ( if ocp corrections are included ) .",
    "the resulting partial ionizations and densities are displayed in table [ tab2 ] , and comparisons with the opal values @xcite and with the qlmd results of dai _ et al .",

    "a new approach for the thermodynamics of plasma mixtures has been presented .",
    "all electrons are treated quantum - mechanically and the shell structure has an important impact on the partial densities of different elements .",
