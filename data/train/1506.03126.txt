    "entanglement is the distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and is the physical phenomenon according to which only the properties of the entire system have precise values , while the physical properties of a subsystem can be assigned only in reference to those of the other ones .",
    "it is now intensively studied because it corresponds to peculiar nonlocal correlations which allows performing communication and computation tasks with an efficiency which is not achievable classically @xcite .    furthermore , for a deeper understanding of the boundary between the classical and quantum world , it is important to investigate up to which macroscopic scale one can observe quantum behavior , and in particular under which conditions entanglement between macroscopic objects , each containing a large number of the constituents , can arise .",
    "entanglement between two atomic ensembles has been successfully demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , while entanglement between two josephson - junction qubits has been detected in refs .",
    "more recently , macroscopic entanglement has been demonstrated in electro - mechanical systems  @xcite : continuous variable ( cv ) entanglement , similar to that considered by einstein podolski and rosen ( epr )  @xcite , has been generated and detected between the position and momentum of a vibrational mode of a @xmath0 @xmath1m - diameter al membrane , and the quadratures of a microwave cavity field , following the theory proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "entanglement between two mechanical resonators ( mrs ) has been instead demonstrated only at the microscopic level , in the case of two trapped ions  @xcite , and between two single - phonon excitations in nano - diamonds  @xcite .",
    "the realization of this kind of entanglement at the more macroscopic level of micromechanical resonators would be extremely important both for practical and fundamental reasons .",
    "in fact , on the one hand , entangled mrs at distant sites could represent an important building block for the implementation of quantum networks for long - distance routing of quantum information  @xcite ; on the other hand , these nonclassical states represent an ideal playground for investigating and comparing decoherence theories and modifications of quantum mechanics at the macroscopic level  @xcite .",
    "many different schemes have been proposed in the literature for entangling two mrs , especially exploiting optomechanical and electromechanical devices  @xcite , in which the two mrs simultaneously interact with one or more electromagnetic cavity fields .",
    "@xcite considered the steady state of different systems of driven cavities : ref .",
    "@xcite focused on two mirrors of a ring cavity , while ref .",
    "@xcite assumed to drive two independent linear cavities with two - mode squeezed light transferring its entanglement to the cavity end - mirrors .",
    "@xcite instead considered a double - cavity scheme in which one cavity couples to the relative motion of two mrs , and the second cavity to their center - of - mass ; when the system is appropriately driven by squeezed light , such squeezing is transferred to the two mrs which are then prepared in a stationary epr - like state .",
    "actually , steady - state entanglement can be achieved , even if at a smaller value , also without squeezed driving , either between two movable mirrors in a fabry - perot cavity  @xcite , between two mechanical modes of a single movable mirror  @xcite , or in the case of two semi - transparent membranes interacting with two driven cavity modes  @xcite .",
    "a different approach for generating entangled mrs exploits conditional measurements on light modes entangled or correlated with mechanical degrees of freedom  @xcite . in this case , entanglement is generated at the measurement and it has a finite lifetime which may be severely limited by the interaction of the mrs with their reservoirs .",
    "a similar strategy has been provided to enhance the entanglement of two mrs  @xcite .",
    "more recent proposal applied reservoir engineering ideas  @xcite to optomechanical scenarios , by exploiting suitable multi - frequency drivings and optical architectures in order to achieve more robust generation of steady state entanglement between two mrs  @xcite , eventually profiting from mechanical nonlinearities and/or parametric driving  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we propose a novel optomechanical / electromechanical scheme for the generation of remarkably large cv entanglement between two mrs with different frequencies , which is also extremely robust with respect to thermal noise .",
    "the scheme is particularly simple , involving only a single , bichromatically - driven , optical cavity mode , and optimally works in a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) regime where counter - rotating , non - resonant , terms associated with the bichromatic driving are negligible .",
    "the scheme shares some analogies with the reservoir - engineering schemes of refs .",
    "@xcite , but it may be used to generate robust entanglement also in a pulsed regime , in the special case of equal effective couplings at the two sidebands , where the system becomes analogous to the srensen - mlmer scheme for entangling trapped ions in a thermal environment  @xcite . this latter scheme has been already considered in an optomechanical scenario by kuzyk _",

    "the dashed - blue lines are instead evaluated for smaller frequencies . in this case",

    "although the dashed - blue curves are evaluated for a ratio @xmath162 of roughly 25 , which can be considered significantly large , we have found , indeed , that it is not enough for a faithful approximation of the system dynamics with the model discussed in the preceding sections .",
    "the conclusive analysis of these cases would , possibly , require a non - perturbative approach that is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "we have verified that the discrepancy between the dashed - blue lines and the red ones is due to the combined effect of the higher order terms and of the transient initial dynamics of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . specifically , when we consider either the lowest order terms and the transient dynamics , or the higher order terms and only the steady state of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the corresponding results for the entanglement dynamics are very similar to the red lines .    in fig .",
    "[ res2 ] we study the case of equal couplings @xmath163 . in this case",
    "solid and dashed lines differ in the values of the cavity detuning @xmath35",
    ". in general larger @xmath35 ( dashed lines ) corresponds to smaller entanglement , and the results evaluated by including the counter - rotating terms tends to exhibit larger entanglement than the corresponding ones obtained without the non - resonant terms .",
    "the solid curves are found with smaller @xmath35 . in this case",
    "red , green and blue lines are very close when the mechanical dissipation is sufficiently large as in fig .",
    "[ res2 ] ( a ) .",
    "larger discrepancies are found when the mechanical dissipation is reduced as in fig .",
    "[ res2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , especially at relatively large time .",
    "we observe in fact that , while the red curves for the entanglement decay to zero at large time , the corresponding green and blue lines seem to approach a finite sizable value . as shown by the insets , when this different behaviour is observed , the average photon number in the cavity tends to diverge .",
    "this is a signature of the fact that the full dynamics including counter - rotating terms is actually unstable , even though the rwa dynamics without these terms is stable ( see eq .  ( [ stab ] ) ) .",
    "we have confirmed the unstable nature of the time - dependent dynamics by calculating the floquet exponents of the dynamical equations of the system .",
    "in fact , when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are considered in their steady state , one has a system of linear differential equations with periodic , time - dependent coefficients ( see appendix  [ linearization ] ) , and the floquet theory can be applied in this case  @xcite ; we have verified that for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ res2 ] there is always at least one positive floquet exponent , meaning that the system is unstable .",
    "this implies that , in general , the corresponding results are well - grounded only for relatively short time until the populations are not exceedingly large . on the other hand ,",
    "our results show that in a pulsed experiment with the parameters of fig .",
    "[ res2 ] , these instabilities do not constitute a serious hindrance to the creation of significant entanglement at finite times .",
    "therefore , when the mechanical frequencies are sufficiently large ( @xmath164 ) ( and , limited only to the case of equal couplings , when also mechanical damping is not too small ) , the effective linearized rwa dynamics obtained by neglecting the counter - rotating terms approximates with very good accuracy the full system dynamics .",
    "we finally discuss how to detect the generated mechanical entanglement between the two mrs at different frequencies .",
    "the present entanglement describes epr - like correlations between the quadratures of the two mrs and therefore we need to perform homodyne - like detection of these quadratures . in the linearized regime",
    "we are considering the state of the two mrs is a gaussian cv state , which is fully characterized by the matrix of all second - order correlations between the mechanical quadratures . therefore from the measurement of these correlations",
    "one can extract the logarithmic negativity @xmath165 .",
    "one does not typically have direct access to the mechanical quadratures , but one can exploit the currently available possibility to perform low - noise and highly efficient homodyne detection of optical and microwave fields , and implement an efficient transfer of the mechanical phase - space quadratures onto the optical / microwave field .    as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and then implemented in the electromechanical entanglement experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the motional quadratures of a mr can be read by homodyning the output of an additional `` probe '' cavity mode . in particular ,",
    "if the readout cavity mode is driven by a much weaker laser so that its back - action on the mechanical mode can be neglected , and resonant with the first red sideband of the mode , i.e. , with a detuning @xmath166 , @xmath56 , the probe mode adiabatically follows the mr dynamics , and the output of the readout cavity @xmath167 is given by ( see fig .  [ detect ] )  @xcite @xmath168 with @xmath169 the very small optomechanical coupling with the probe mode . therefore using a probe mode for each mr , changing the phases of the corresponding local oscillator , and measuring the correlations between the probe mode outputs",
    ", one can then detect all the entries of the correlation matrix and from them numerically extract the logarithmic negativity @xmath165 .",
    "we have studied in detail a general scheme for the generation of large and robust cv entanglement between two mrs with different frequencies through their coupling with a single , bichromatically driven cavity mode .",
    "the scheme extends and generalizes in various directions similar schemes exploiting driven cavity modes  @xcite for entangling two mrs or two cavity modes .",
    "the scheme is able to generate a remarkably large entanglement between two macroscopic oscillators in the stationary state , i.e. , with virtually infinite lifetime , and it is quite robust because one can achieve appreciably large cv entanglement even with thermal occupancies of the order of @xmath170 .",
    "the scheme is particularly efficient in the limit where counter - rotating terms due to the bichromatic driving of the cavity mode are negligible , and we have verified with a careful numerical analysis that this is well justified when the two mechanical frequencies are sufficiently large @xmath164 .",
