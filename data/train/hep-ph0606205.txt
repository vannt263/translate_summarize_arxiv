    "the evolution of cosmic string networks is a challenging problem .",
    "the need to consider large ratios of length and time scales makes a complete numerical analysis impossible , while the nonlinearity of the process defeats a purely analytic treatment .",
    "thus a full understanding of most of the signatures of cosmic strings will require a careful combination of analytic and numerical approaches .",
    "this is needed both to establish precisely the current bounds on the dimensionless cosmic string tension @xmath0 , and to anticipate what will be the most sensitive future measurements .",
    "also , if cosmic strings are one day discovered , a precise understanding of the network properties will be needed in order to distinguish different microscopic models .    on scales close to the horizon size , the networks are reasonably well understood from simulations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a few dozen long strings crossing any horizon volume . on shorter scales , however , the situation is far less clear .",
    "there is a nontrivial short distance structure on the strings , which arises because the intercommutation process produces kinks  @xcite .",
    "there have been many previous analytic and numerical studies of this , but there is no general consensus as to its nature .    in particular , the size at which typical loops form is uncertain to tens of orders of magnitude .",
    "one widely - held assumption has been that gravitational radiation is necessary in order for cosmic string networks to scale  @xcite , and that it determines the size of loops .",
    "if so , the loops will be parametrically smaller than the horizon scale , by a power of @xmath0  @xcite ( even shorter scales have been suggested  @xcite ) .",
    "more recent work appears to be converging on loop sizes at a fixed fraction of the horizon scale , but even here there are significant differences . ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that loops form at around @xmath1 times the horizon scale , whereas refs .",
    "@xcite ( and some portion of the conventional wisdom ) suggest a scale several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the larger loops would lead to enhanced signatures of several types , and tighter bounds on @xmath0  @xcite .    in a system with a large hierarchy of scales",
    ", one might hope that analytic methods would be particularly useful in separating the processes occurring at different scales , while numerical methods would be needed to understand the nonlinearities at a given scale .",
    "this is the philosophy that we will attempt to implement .",
    "we focus on a microscopic description , similar in spirit to ref .",
    "@xcite and in particular ref .",
    "an important difference from ref .",
    "@xcite is that we are less ambitious : that work was largely directed at understanding the horizon - scale structure quantitatively , whereas we are only interested in shorter scales .",
    "also , we do not attempt to reduce the dynamics to a parameterized model but rather focus on the full two - point function ; this two - point function appears to be characterized by a critical exponent , which did not enter into previous work .",
    "finally , our ( tentative ) conclusions are opposite to ref .",
    "@xcite , in that we believe that the network scales even without gravitational radiation .    the full microscopic equations for the string network  @xcite appear to be too complicated to solve , and so we model what we hope are the essential physical processes .",
    "we have had some success in matching results from simulations , but there are also some discrepancies which may indicate additional processes that must be included .",
    "in section  2 we consider the evolution of a small segment on a long string .",
    "if the rate of string intercommutations is fixed in horizon units , then over a range of scales the only important effect would be stretching due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "we are then able to determine the two - point functions characterizing the small scale structure .",
    "we find that the string is actually rather smooth , in agreement with recent simulations  @xcite : its fractal dimension approaches one as we go to smaller scales .",
    "there is a nontrivial power law , but this appears in the _ approach _ of the fractal dimension to one ; that is , the critical exponent @xmath2 is related to the power spectum of perturbations on the long string .",
    "the two - point functions depend on two parameters that must be taken from simulations .",
    "one of these is the mean @xmath3 of an element of the long string ; this determines the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the second parameter is the normalization of the two - point function .",
    "our results for the two - point function match reasonably well with the simulations  @xcite over a range of scales , but there is substantial deviation at the shortest scales .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this is due to transient effects in the simulations , or real effects that we have omitted .",
    "in section  3 we study the effects of the small scale structure on string lensing . because the string is fairly smooth , these effects are not as dramatic as has been considered in some previous work . however , there are calculable deviations from perfect lensing .",
    "we also consider , for lensing by a long string , the likely trajectory of the string relative to the axis of a given lensed object .",
    "we discuss some deviations from gaussianity in the small scale structure , due to kinks .    in section",
    "4 we add in loop production as a perturbation . even though the strings are relatively smooth at short distance",
    ", we find that the total rate of loop production diverges for small loops ; the rate of divergence appears to agree with recent simulations  @xcite .",
    "this divergence does not invalidate our stretching model , because the loop production is localized to regions where the left- and right - moving tangents @xmath4 are approximately equal , but it points to a complicated fragmentation process , cascading to smaller and smaller loops .",
    "we are not able to follow the fragmentation process analytically at present , but we give an analytic argument as to why the cascade should terminate , leaving loops at some small but fixed multiple of the horizon scale .",
    "we also point out an interesting puzzle related to loop velocities , which again points to a complicated fragmentation process .    in section  5",
    "we discuss various applications and future directions .",
    "the behavior of string networks is notoriously complicated , and it appears to remain so even when one focusses on small scales .",
    "thus we view our work as part of an ongoing dialogue between analytic calculations and simulations , which we hope will lead to a more complete and precise picture .",
    "we consider `` vanilla '' cosmic strings , a single species of local string without superconducting or other extra internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the evolution of a network of such strings is dictated by three distinct processes .",
    "first , the expansion of the universe stretches the strings : on scales larger than the horizon scale @xmath5 irregularities on a string are just conformally amplified , but on smaller scales the string effectively straightens  @xcite .",
    "this is described by the nambu action in curved spacetime .",
    "second , gravitational radiation also has the effect of straightening the strings , but it is significant only below a length scale proportional to @xmath5 and to a positive power of the dimensionless string coupling @xmath0  @xcite . since this is parametrically small at small @xmath0 , we will ignore this effect for the present purposes .",
    "finally , intercommutations play an important role in reaching a scaling solution , in particular through the formation of closed loops of string . at first",
    "we shall neglect this effect but we will be forced to return to this issue in section  4 .",
    "let us consider the evolution of a small segment on a long string .",
    "we take the segment to be very short compared to the horizon scale , but long compared to the scale at which gravitational radiation is relevant .",
    "the scaling property of the network implies that the probability per hubble time for this segment to be involved in a long string intercommutation event is proportional to its length divided by @xmath5 , and so for short segments the intercommutation rate per hubble time will be small .",
    "formation of a loop much larger than the segment might remove the entire segment from the long string , but this should have little correlation with the configuration of the segment itself , and so will not affect the probability distribution for the ensemble of short segments .",
    "formation of loops at the size of the segment and smaller could affect this distribution , and the results of section  4 will indicate that the production of small loops is large , but this process takes place only in localized regions where the left- and right - moving tangents are approximately equal .",
    "thus , there is a regime where stretching is the only relevant process .",
    "if we follow a segment forward in time , its length increases but certainly does so more slowly than the horizon scale @xmath5 , which is proportional to the frw time @xmath6 .",
    "thus the length divided by @xmath5 decreases , and therefore so does the rate of intercommutation .",
    "if we follow the segment backward in time , its length eventually begins to approach the horizon scale , and the probability becomes large that we encounter an intercommutation event .",
    "our strategy is therefore clear . for the highly nonlinear processes near the horizon scale we must trust simulations . at a somewhat lower scale we can read off the various correlators describing the behavior of the string , and then evolve them forward in time using the nambu action until we reach the gravitational radiation scale .",
    "the small probability of an intercommutation involving the short segment can be added as a perturbation .",
    "this approach is in the spirit of the renormalization group , though with long and short distances reversed .      in an frw spacetime",
    ", @xmath7 the equation of motion governing the evolution of a cosmic string is  @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 these equations hold in the transverse gauge , where @xmath11 .",
    "dots and primes refer to derivatives relative to the conformal time @xmath12 and the spatial parameter @xmath13 along the string , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the parameter @xmath9 follows from equation ( [ eom ] ) , @xmath14 from the second derivative terms it follows that signals on the string propagate to the right and left with @xmath15 .",
    "thus the structure on a short piece of string at a given time is a superposition of left- and right - moving segments , and it is these that we follow in time . in an expanding spacetime",
    "the left- and right - moving waves interact  they are not free as in flat spacetime .    from eq .",
    "( [ epsev ] ) it follows that the time scale of variation of @xmath9 is the hubble time , and so to good approximation we can replace @xmath16 with the time - averaged @xmath17 ( bars will always refer to rms averages ) , giving @xmath18 as a function of time only . reparameterizations .",
    "a convenient choice is to take @xmath9 to be independent of @xmath13 at the final time , and then @xmath9 will be @xmath13-independent to good approximation on any horizon length scale in the past . ] from the definition of @xmath9 it then follows that the energy of a segment of string of coordinate length @xmath13 is @xmath19 . for simplicity we will refer to @xmath20 as the length @xmath21 of a segment , @xmath22 though this is literally true only in the rest frame .",
    "the scale factor is @xmath23 where @xmath24 the mean rms velocities for points on long strings are taken from simulations  @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath25 in the radiation era , @xmath26 and in the matter era @xmath27 .",
    "thus the physical length of the segment grows in time , but more slowly than the comoving length  @xcite , and much more slowly than the horizon length @xmath28 .    for illustration ,",
    "consider a segment of length @xmath29 , as would be relevant for lensing at a separation of a few seconds and a redshift of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "according to the discussion above , @xmath31 depends on time as @xmath32 in the matter era .",
    "thus the length of the segment would have been around a hundredth of the horizon scale at the radiation - to - matter transition . in other words , it is the nonlinear horizon scale dynamics in the radiation epoch that produces the short - distance structure that is relevant for lensing today , in this model .",
    "this makes clear the limitation of simulations by themselves for studying the small scale structure on strings , as they are restricted to much smaller dynamical ranges .    in terms of left- and right - moving unit vectors",

    "suppose we see a lens due to a long string , with a certain alignment . where should we look for additional lens candidates ?",
    "previous discussions  @xcite have considered the two extreme cases of a string that is nearly straight , and a string that is a random walk on short scales ; clearly the networks that we are considering are very close to the first case .",
    "we keep the frame of the previous section , with the lens at the origin in @xmath182 and aligned along the 1-axis .",
    "then as we move along the string , the rms transverse deviation is @xmath183 the extension in the @xmath184 direction is just @xmath21 , so the rms angular deviation is @xmath185 if we put in representative numbers , looking at an apparent separation on the scale of arc - minutes for a lens at a redshift of order @xmath1 , we obtain with the matter era parameters a deviation @xmath186 radians .",
    "that is , any additional lenses should be rather well aligned with the axis of the first .",
    "if the string is tilted by an angle @xmath187 to the line of sight , then projection effects increase @xmath188 and @xmath189 by a factor @xmath190 . of course , for lensing by a _ loop _ , the bending will be large at lengths comparable to the size of the loop .",
    "lens alignment provides an interesting setting for discussing the nongaussianity of the structure on the string . if the fluctuations of @xmath191 were gaussian , then the probability of finding a second lens at an angle @xmath189 to the axis of the first would be proportional to @xmath192 , and therefore very small at large angles .",
    "however , we have considered thus far a typical string segment , which undergoes only stretching .",
    "there will be a small fraction of segments that contain a large kink , and one might expect that it is these that dominate the tail of the distribution of bending angles .",
    "let us work this out explicitly .",
    "consider a left - moving segment of coordinate length @xmath13 , and let @xmath193 be the probability that it contain a kink for which the discontinuity @xmath194 lies between @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) .",

    "it is slightly simpler to consider the angle @xmath188 between the two axes . in the small fluctuation approximation",
    "this is just @xmath215 , and so the rms fluctuation is @xmath216 in the gaussian approximation , the probability distribution is @xmath217 and so is very small for large angles . on the other hand ,",
    "a large angle might also arise from a segment that happens to contain a single recent kink .",
    "treating the segment as straight on each side of the kink , the probability density is then precisely the function @xmath193 just obtained , with @xmath218 .",
    "if we consider angles that are large compared to @xmath219 but still small compared to 1 , the range of integration in the solution  ( [ psol ] ) extends essentially to the full range @xmath220 to @xmath221 and so the integral gives a constant .",

    "we will treat the stretching model as a leading approximation , and add in the loop production as a perturbation .",

    "the divergence of the rate of loop loss implies that at scales @xmath21 well below @xmath315 the nave number density of loops of size @xmath316 is greater than @xmath317 : these become dense on the string .",
    "thus we might come to the conclusion that the fragmentation process continues until we end up with all loops at the gravitational radiation scale , the opposite of the nave result  ( [ lstar ] ) above .",

    ". the exponent may be rather small , so there could be a substantial production of small loops .",
    "the divergent rate of loop production implies that our initial attempt to use analytic methods to separate scales has been too simple , but we might hope that a more sophisticated scaling model along the lines just indicated will be successful .",
    "let us briefly describe an analytic model of the formation of non - self - intersecting loops .",
    "when the loop forms , we can define the distributions @xmath320 because of the high fractal dimensions of the curves @xmath321 , we might think of these distributions as reasonably smooth functions .",
    "the structure on the high harmonics of the loop will tend to smear these distributions into gaussians , but they will be skewed by the particular random values of the lowest harmonics .",

    "the production of the smallest loops is roughly local in @xmath324 , and so it can only continue until whichever of the two densities is smaller has been depleted .",
    "this leaves residual distributions @xmath325 according to the sign of the difference at each point .",
    "this nonvanishing difference implies a cutoff on the production of the smallest loops , and allows non - self - intersecting loops of finite size to form .",
    "the results that we have found have some notable agreements , and disagreements , with simulations .",
    "one success is an apparent agreement with the recent simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite for the distribution of loop sizes : that reference finds a number density of loops per volume and per length @xmath326 with @xmath327 in the matter era and @xmath328 in the radiation era .",
    "we have exponents @xmath329 and 2.8 respectively .",
    "our exponent is for the production rate rather than the density , but in this regime the density is dominated by recently produced loops and so these are the same .",
    "let us verify this , and also obtain the relative normalizations for the two quantities .",
    "the number of loops per comoving volume of length between @xmath21 and @xmath224 is unaffected by the expansion of the universe , and we are assuming that we are at scales where gravitational radiation can be neglected .",
    "the number then changes only due to production : @xmath330 where we have inserted the string scaling density @xmath331 .",
    "this integral is dominated by recent times as long as @xmath332 , as holds in both eras ( again , @xmath333 ) .",
    "integrating over time then gives @xmath334 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath335 where the last factor is from the conversion from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . using @xmath336 respectively in the matter and radiation eras  @xcite ,",
    "this gives @xmath337 , 10.3 .",
    "these are larger than found in ref .",
    "@xcite by factors of 20 and 260 respectively .",
    "a large difference is not surprising , as we have argued that there will be substantial fragmentation which will move the loops to smaller @xmath21 where the distributions are larger .",
    "however , it remains to be seen whether this can account for such an enormous difference .",
    "the fragmentation need not change the scaling as long as the long - string correlation functions remains a power law , because the shapes of the produced loops , and the resulting fragmentation , all scale ; thus the agreement of the loop production exponents may be real .",
    "as we have noted , the loop scaling must eventually break down due to conservation of string , but with these reduced normalizations this happens at much lower scales , @xmath338 and @xmath339 respectively .",
    "below these scales we expect the distribution to fall as discussed in the fragmentation discussion .",
    "thus we might expect the distribution to peak near these scales , but perhaps to be rather broad in both directions .",

    "specific signatures , however , might be dominated by the tails , either at large loops or small .",
    "the relatively large scale  ( [ lstar ] ) is similar to that found in the recent paper  @xcite . as discussed in sec .",
    "4.2 , we expect that the final loop size is much smaller because of extensive fragmentation ; the divergence that we have found for small loop formation will be equally present in the calculation of fragmentation of a large loop into smaller ones . ref .",
    "@xcite finds a much less extensive fragmentation .",
    "this points up the need for more complete studies of this process . this should be possible within the context of flat spacetime simulations , beginning with long strings having the small scale structure as input (",
    "this does depend on resolving first the issue of the long string two - point function , to which we return below ) .",
    "the production of very small loops takes place when @xmath343 : that is , near cusps on the long strings as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . indeed ,",
    "all the loops that we consider are rather smaller than the correlation length , so the functions @xmath344 and @xmath345 are each somewhat localized on the unit sphere , and necessarily in the same region since @xmath231 . in this sense",
    "all of our loops are produced near cusps .",
    "it is possible that there is a second population of loops that form at scales much longer than the correlation length , though most of these will quickly reconnect with long strings .",
    "the picture of a complicated fragmentation process is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "now let us return to the two - point functions as found there .",
    "the partial agreement with our stretching model might now seem surprising , given the large production of small loops .",
    "if the loop formation were distributed on the long strings , there would be at least one additional effect , where the string shortens due to loop emission and more distant ( and therefore less correlated ) segments are brought closer together .",
    "however , the loop production is not distributed : it occurs when the functions @xmath321 , as they wander on the unit sphere , come close together .",
    "our picture is that whole segments of order @xmath315 ( [ lstar ] ) are then excised .",
    "thus , most of the segments that remain on a long string at given time would have been little affected by loop production .",
    "the discrepancy at short scales , which is particularly evident in the radiation era ( fig .  1 ) , remains a puzzle .",
    "let us first note that at the shortest scales in figs . 1 and 2 the slope of the curve approaches and possibly even exceeds unity , corresponding to the critical value @xmath346 : if the two - point function is of this form then the small - loop production converges .",
    "thus it is appealing to assume that it is feedback from production of short loops that accounts for the break in the curve in fig",
    ".  1 . corresponds to the functions @xmath170 being random walks on the unit sphere .",
    "this again suggests this value might be some dynamical fixed point .",
    "] this is distinctly different from the cutoff via a @xmath347 hole as discussed in sec.4.2 and and in ref .",
    "@xcite : the latter is a modification of the @xmath348 correlations ( though one that would have little effect on the two - point function ) , whereas fig .  1 shows a modification of the @xmath349 correlation .",
    "we are unable to identify a physical mechanism that would account for the observed two - point function .",
    "consider a very short segment on a long string .",
    "with time , its size as a fraction of the horizon size decreases , so it moves to the left on figs .  1 and  2 .",
    "if it experiences only stretching , it will follow the slope of the dashed line .",
    "the loop production must have a strong bias toward removing segments with large fluctuations to account for the simulations .",
    "however , the general picture above is that the initial loop formation occurs at the scale @xmath315 , and so any small segments will be carried away without any bias on their own internal configuration .",
    "thus we would expect the two - point function to be given by the stretching power law down to arbitrarily small scales , until gravitational radiation enters .",
    "slightly is that segments that do not fall into the loop production ` hole ' at @xmath350 may experience on average a larger value of @xmath351 and so have a reduced two - point function  see eq .",

    "@xcite ( the discrepancy is then even greater in the radiation era ) .",
    "assuming that both simulations are correct , we must conclude that the two - point function on loops is very different from that on long strings , in fact less correlated .",
    "one possible explanation is that loop formation is biased in this way , but this seems unlikely : loops form when right- and left - moving segments of equal @xmath359 meet , and this will happen most often in the center of the distribution .",
    "rather , this seems to be another indication of the complicated nature of the fragmentation : the final non - self - intersecting loops must contain segments which began on the long string many times further separated than the final loop size .",
    "our attempt to isolate the physics on different scales has not been completely successful , but it suggests some interesting directions for future work .",
    "first of all , the two - point function on long strings must be better understood : is the discrepancy in fig .  1 a result of omitted physics or numerical transients ?",
    "this question can be settled numerically , by studying sensitivity to initial conditions , and by studying the time - dependence of an ensemble of small segments . a good understanding of the two - point function would then allow extrapolation to much smaller scales , for application to lensing ( as in section  3 ) , gravitational radiation  @xcite , and possible interference between short distance structure and cusps  @xcite .",
    "second , our work points to correlations among the two - point function , loop production , fragmentation , and loop velocity .",

    "@xcite must presumably be understood in terms of fragmentation .    in conclusion",
    ", cosmic string networks are probably not as complicated as turbulence , but they share the property that a rather simple set of classical equations leads to a complicated dynamics that challenges both numerical and analytical attacks . we hope that our work is a step toward a more unified understanding of the properties of these networks .",

    "<S> the properties of string networks at scales well below the horizon are poorly understood , but they enter critically into many observables . we argue that in some regimes , stretching will be the only relevant process governing the evolution . in this case , the string two - point function is determined up to normalization : the fractal dimension approaches one at short distance , but the rate of approach is characterized by an exponent that plays an essential role in network properties . </S>",
    "<S> the smoothness at short distance implies , for example , that cosmic string lensing images are little distorted . </S>",
    "<S> we then add in loop production as a perturbation and find that it diverges at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> this need not invalidate the stretching model , since the loop production occurs in localized regions , but it implies a complicated fragmentation process . our ability to model this process is limited , but we argue that loop production peaks a few orders of magnitude below the horizon scale , without the inclusion of gravitational radiation . we find agreement with some features of simulations , and interesting discrepancies that must be resolved by future work .    </S>",
