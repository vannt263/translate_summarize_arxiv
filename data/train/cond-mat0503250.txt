    "since the discovery of the high temperature superconductors(htsc ) in the 1980 s , many experiments have been done to disclose the microscopic origin of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "for example , inelastic neutron scattering revealed a peculiar magnetic resonance mode at an energy of 41 mev in two - dimensional reciprocal lattice position ( @xmath6,@xmath6 ) for optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath7o@xmath8@xcite .",
    "the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has indicated a kink in the band dispersion as well as an anisotropic gap ( the d - wave behavior ) for some high - t@xmath4 cuprates.@xcite .",
    "these results are very helpful for understanding the superconductivity mechanism in the cuprates .",
    "naturally , one may ask whether these behaviors are generic in htsc materials .",
    "but there are technical reasons why those experimental probes have not been used with success on all the families of htscs . for example",
    ", inelastic neutron scattering experiment requires large - size single crystals and had mostly been done on ybco-123 and lsco-214@xcite , although some groups have tried to work on tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath9 by synthesizing about 300 relatively large ( 0.5 to 3mm@xmath10 ) single crystals and co - aligning them in a mosaic of total volume 0.11cm@xmath10@xcite , as well as on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath12 with a comparatively large single crystal of volume 10@xmath135@xmath131.2mm@xmath10 and mosaicity ( that is , the angular spread of the crystallographic axes ) , @xmath141@xmath15@xcite . tunnelling spectroscopy and arpes are surface - sensitive probes .",
    "they are mainly applied to bi - based cuprate systems as they could be cleaved easily in a vacuum along the bi - o planes , yielding a high - quality virgin surface@xcite .",
    "however , technique like optical spectroscopy places relatively less demands on the sample size and surface , and have consequently been applied with success to a larger number of high temperature superconducting systems . at present ,",
    "optical probes cover a wide frequency and temperature range , which have provided much useful information about charge excitations and dynamics of cuprate superconductors .    in the whole htsc families ,",
    "thallium - based cuprates have provided a large series of superconductors including single tl - o layered compounds with the number of cuo@xmath16 layers from 1 to 5 and double tl - o layered compounds tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with the cuo@xmath16 layers n from 1 to 3 ( hereafter abbreviated as tl-2201 , tl-2212 , tl-2223 , respectively)@xcite .",
    "the tl - based cuprates offer a good opportunity to investigate the physical properties of systems with different number of cuo@xmath16 layers in a unit cell , and therefore different t@xmath4 at the optimal doping .",
    "this will help to understand the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "another advantage of tl - based cuprates is that , all the double tl - o layer based cuprates have higher @xmath17s than the double bi - o layer based cuprates with the same structure . even for the single cuo@xmath16 layered compound tl-2201 , its t@xmath4 can reach 90 k. consequently",
    ", the difference between the superconducting state and the normal state can be easily probed . nevertheless , despite those advantages ,",
    "much less spectroscopic studies have been done on the tl - based cuprates .",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining high quality single crystal samples .",
    "one has to overcome the problem of avoiding the poisonous thallium volatility and formation of intergrowth defects during crystal growth@xcite .",
    "infrared studies have been done on crystals of single - layered tl-2201@xcite , and thin - films of double - layered tl-2212@xcite , but there is still no report , to the best of our knowledge , on triple - layered tl-2223 and any other tl - based superconductors .",

    ", we first describe the crystal growth procedure and characterization of the as grown crystals by the ac magnetic susceptibility , x - ray diffraction measurements and edx compositional analysis .",
    "then , we report the measurement of the in - plane infrared reflectance . as optical data for optimally doped tl-2201 and tl-2212 are available in literature , we place emphasis on the spectra collected on triple - layered tl-2223 crystals and their comparisons with data of tl-2212 and tl-2201 . very similar to the tl-2201 and tl-2212 , we observe significant change of spectra after entering superconducting state , which was related to the combination of a boson mode and a gap .",

    "single crystals were grown by the flux method from raw materials with nominal compositions as listed in table i. the mixed oxide bacacuo powders were synthesized prior to the crystal growth .",
    "for example , we made the bacacuo-223x powder for tl-2212 , and bacacuo-266x for tl-2223 .",
    "then , tl@xmath0o@xmath7 powder was added into the mixed powders to get a stoichiometry as in table i. the ratio of the oxide powders is essential for the crystal phase growth .    in the growth experiment , the powders of amount @xmath1815 grams were ground in an agate mortar , then placed in an alumina crucible and covered with two al@xmath0o@xmath7 lids for decreasing the volatility of tl@xmath0o@xmath7 .",

    "in particular , for those systems with different t@xmath4 at optimal doping , the positive maximum and the negative minimum increase systematically with t@xmath4 .    it also deserves to remark that some weak maxima could exist preceding the main peak in w(@xmath25 ) .",
    "they come from the week fluctuations in the fitting curves due to the experimental noise in the far - infrared region . because the signal - to - noise level at low-@xmath25 side depends strongly on the sample size , those structures",

    "they emphasized that at t=0 k the maximum and minimum are at the same frequency , while at finite temperature , the maximum shifts to low frequency , but the minimum remains at the same frequency as at t=0 k. so , they also identify the 2@xmath45+@xmath46 with the deep minimum in w(@xmath25 ) .",

    "it is still under dispute whether the mode is a phonon or a magnetic resonance as detected by neutron scattering experiment .",
    "if the maximum or minimum indeed involve a sum of the gap @xmath45 and a boson mode @xmath46 , then the scaling behavior not only means that the gap amplitude @xmath45 is proportional to t@xmath4 , but boson mode energy @xmath46 is also proportional to t@xmath4 for the different systems . in this case , the phonon origin for the boson mode is unambiguously ruled out , because the in - plane phonon is determined by the cu - o bond length , which should not change in systems with different t@xmath4 .    however , we would also like to point out that the above scenario of a mode plus a gap for the reflectance feature below t@xmath4 relies on the clean limit of the ab - plane superconductivity . the unreasonable result obtained from the energy difference between the dip and the peak in terms of the model by carbotte",
    "et al.@xcite may suggest that the ab - plane of high - t@xmath4 cuprates may not be in clean limit . in the case of dirty limit ,",
    "on the other hand , the sharp rise feature in the scattering rate should be at 2@xmath45 , since the impurities elastic scattering should be able to transfer the momentum of the particle - hole excitations without affecting the threshold energy . at present , there is still no agreement on whether or not the ab - plane is in clean limit .",
    "very recently , homes@xcite suggests that the criteria of a small value of the quasiparticle scattering rate for t @xmath48t@xmath5 is not a good measure of whether or not the superconductivity is in the clean or dirty limit .",
    "by contrast , the normal - state value of 1/@xmath38 should be considered when determining whether a system is in the clean or dirty limit .",
    "they also pointed out that the clean - limit requirement is much more stringent for a d - wave system than it is for a material with an isotropic energy gap , since it not only requires 1/@xmath38 much less than the maximum gap amplitude , but also 1/@xmath38@xmath492@xmath50 in the nodal regions .",
    "they established a linear scaling relation @xmath51 for cuprates@xcite , and argued that this scaling is the hallmark of a dirty - limit system@xcite . in a dirty - limit case ,",
    "no boson mode would be involved in the sharp rise of scattering rate , or the main peak in the spectral function w(@xmath25 ) .",

    "<S> single crystals of thallium - based cuprates with the general formula tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3(n=1,2,3 ) have been grown by the flux method . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperatures determined by the ac magnetic susceptibility are 92 k , 109 k , and 119 k for n=1,2,3 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction measurements and edx compositional analysis were described . </S>",
    "<S> we measured in - plane optical reflectance from room temperature down to 10 k , placing emphasis on tl-2223 . </S>",
    "<S> the reflectance roughly has a linear - frequency dependence above superconducting transition temperature , but displays a pronounced knee structure together with a dip - like feature at higher frequency below t@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the ratio of the reflectances below and above t@xmath5 displays a maximum and a minimum near those feature frequencies . in particular , those features in tl2223 appear at higher energy scale than tl2212 , and tl2201 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical data are analyzed in terms of spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the physical consequences of the data in terms of both clean and dirty limit . </S>"
