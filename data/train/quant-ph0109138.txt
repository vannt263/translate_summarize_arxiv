    "<S> we show the possibility to improve the measurement sensitivity of a weak force by using massive probes in an entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> this latter can be achieved by exploiting radiation pressure effects .    since the original formulation of quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> entanglement has been recognized as one of its most puzzling features @xcite . during the last few years </S>",
    "<S> a considerable amount of literature focused on methods to prepare atoms in nonclassical and also entangled states appeared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a striking achievement in this rapidly expanding field has been the recent entanglement of two gas samples of atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contemporarily we proposed to exploit the radiation pressure to entangle massive macroscopic oscillators , like pendular mirrors in a cavity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once the entanglement between macroscopic oscillators has been shown to be accessible , another important achievement would be to give a technological application of such a property of their states , by considering them as probes . </S>",
    "<S> then , our aim is to show here the potentiality of using these entangled oscillators in quantum metrology . </S>",
    "<S> this was already recognized in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it was proposed to use entangled atoms for very high precision clocks . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show , instead , that one can use entangled probes for very sensitive tiny forces measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> essentially , a classical coherent force causes a displacement of the probe ( e.g. a pendular mirror ) resulting in the shift of its state in the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> such a displacement would be recognized through a readout apparatus ( e.g. radiation field ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ultimate limit in this kind of measurement is represented by the width of the probe s probability density along the displacement direction . in the most performing case , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the oscillator s ground state probability density determines the so called standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this state can be identified with the vacuum state at zero temperature , so , to beat it , one should put the probe at least in a squeezed state @xcite .    cavities with one pendular mirror have already been studied @xcite , showing a variety of intriguing effects coming from optomechanical coupling @xcite . moreover , due to the recent technological developments in optomechanics , this area is now experimentally accessible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the aim of this paper is to show that the use of two entangled probes ( two pendular mirrors ) surely improves the sensitivity of a weak force measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> _ state preparation _    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a cavity with two ( identical ) pendular mirrors , playing the role of probes , whose free hamiltonian can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the ( dimensionless ) position and momentum operators ( with commutation relation @xmath4=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] ) and @xmath5 is their frequency </S>",
    "<S> .    in practical situations massive probes are always far from sql @xcite , mainly due to the thermal noise associated to their ( initial ) state . here </S>",
    "<S> , we shall show how to prepare a probes state having a reduced uncertainty which improves their sensitivity . to this end we recast the model introduced in ref.@xcite , where we have shown the possibility of entangling massive probes by exploiting the radiation pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to consider a radiation field , the _ entangler _ , described by the cavity mode @xmath6 , mediating information between the two mirrors ( probes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction hamiltonian , to be added to eq.([eq : h0 ] ) , results of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the optomechanical coupling constant depending on the probes mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since we require an intense cavity field we are naturally lead to a quadratic form of @xmath9 by the simple replacement @xmath10 , where now @xmath11 denotes the classical amplitude of the cavity field and @xmath12 the quantum fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have the following linear heisenberg equations    [ eqs : lineqs ] @xmath13    where @xmath3 and @xmath14 is the field detuning @xcite . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath14 the @xmath6 mode can be adiabatically eliminated obtaining    [ eqs : eqsmet ] @xmath15    the solution of these equations reads @xmath16 { \\hat q}_{1}(0 )      + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [      \\sin(\\omega t)+(-)^{j-1 }      \\frac{\\omega}{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta t)\\right ] { \\hat p}_{1}(0 )      \\nonumber\\\\      & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [      \\cos(\\omega t)+(-)^{j}\\cos(\\theta t)\\right ] { \\hat q}_{2}(0 )      + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [      \\sin(\\omega t)+(-)^{j }      \\frac{\\omega}{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta t)\\right ] { \\hat p}_{2}(0 )      \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the quantity @xmath17\\right\\}^{1/2}\\,.\\ ] ] the corresponding expression for @xmath18 can be easily determined through the time derivative of the above eq.([eqs : sol ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we evaluate the fluctuations over a separable thermal state as could be that of realistic massive probes . such state can be written as @xmath19\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20^{-2}$ ] with @xmath21 the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 the equilibrium temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of thermal excitations for each probe is @xmath23/2 $ ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , it can be easily seen that if we turn off the entangler at time @xmath24 , we are left with the following variances @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . by using eq.([eq : corr ] ) we recognize that for @xmath28 it is possible to reduce the noise in the quadrature @xmath29 bringing the probes state close to an eigenstate of this quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case the probes state would be a kind of epr state @xcite . to be more precise , a general separability criterion introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gives @xmath30\\rangle_{{\\hat\\rho}_{th}}|^{2}\\,,\\ ] ] then , the condition @xmath31 guarantees entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a great improvement in the minimum detectable force as we shall see .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , after interaction ( [ eq : hint1 ] ) , leaving the probes to freely evolve one ends up with a gaussian state , say @xmath32 , characterized by the following covariance matrix @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the phase space rotation angle depending on the frequency @xmath5 and on the elapsed time .    </S>",
    "<S> _ weak force measurement _    after state preparation , we consider the action of a classical force on the probes and its readout through radiation fields . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interaction hamiltonian to be added to @xmath35 would now be @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dimensionless force strength . here </S>",
    "<S> , the force is considered as acting on the relative variables of the probes , as for example , it is the case of gravitational radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath38 are operators describing the meter fields which deserve as readout . </S>",
    "<S> these could be proper modes of additional cavities . </S>",
    "<S> they are optomechanically coupled to the probes with a strength @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming again intense fields , we are led to linear heisenberg equations    [ eqs : lineqs ] @xmath40    where @xmath41 denotes the classical fields amplitude and @xmath38 the quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> tpically , it should be @xmath42 since radiation pressure could blur the signal . </S>",
    "<S> that is also the reason why we now consider the entangler turned off .    </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and introducing the field quadratures @xmath45 , @xmath46 , ( with commutation relation @xmath47=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] ) , we immediately see that only the phase quadratures @xmath48 carrie out information about the force . as matter of fact , from eqs.([eqs : lineqs ] ) , we obtain @xmath49      \\hat{p}_{j}(0 )      \\nonumber\\\\      & + & 2\\frac{(g\\gamma)^{2}}{\\omega^{2}}\\left[\\omega\\tau      -\\sin\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right)\\right ]      \\hat{x}_{j}(0 )      + \\sqrt{2}\\frac{g\\gamma}{\\omega}\\left[\\omega\\tau-      \\sin\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right)\\right]f      + \\hat{y}_{j}(0)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the time duration of the force . </S>",
    "<S> then , performing homodyne detection @xcite on the meters fields one can get the following signal @xmath51\\,f\\,.\\ ] ] the corresponding noise can be calculated by means of the initial state of the probes , @xmath32 , and the vacuum noise for the meters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we get @xmath52^{2 }      \\right\\rangle      & \\equiv & { \\cal n}(\\tau )      \\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\left(\\frac{g\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)^{2 }      \\sin^{2}\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right )       \\left[r^{-2}\\cos^{2}\\phi+r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\phi\\right ]      \\left(1 + 2{\\cal n}_{th}\\right )      \\nonumber\\\\      & + & \\left(\\frac{g\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)^{2 }      \\left[1-\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right)\\right]^{2 }      \\left[r^{-2}\\sin^{2}\\phi+r^{2}\\cos^{2}\\phi\\right ]      \\left(1 + 2{\\cal n}_{th}\\right )      \\nonumber\\\\      & -&2\\left(\\frac{g\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)^{2}\\sin\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right )      \\left[1-\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right)\\right ]      \\left[r^{-2}-r^{2}\\right]\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi      \\left(1 + 2{\\cal n}_{th}\\right )      \\nonumber\\\\      & + & 4\\left(\\frac{g\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)^{4 }      \\left[\\omega\\tau-\\sin\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right)\\right]^{2 }      \\nonumber\\\\      & + & 1\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first three terms in eq.([eq : noi ] ) come from the probes state , while the fourth term is due to the back action of the meters modes ( radiation pressure noise ) , and the final @xmath53 is the shot noise term . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that for @xmath54 integer multiple of @xmath55 the noise does no longer depend on the initial probes state @xcite , but for all other times it does </S>",
    "<S> . such state in our case is characterized by @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath56 fixed , one might optimize @xmath34 , and then reduce the noise by increasing @xmath57 . in doing </S>",
    "<S> so we get @xmath58 }      { \\sin^{2}(\\omega\\tau)-\\left[1-\\cos(\\omega\\tau)\\right]^{2 } }      \\right\\}+n\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is an integer number .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevant quantity to study is the signal to noise ratio @xmath60 which gives the minimum detectable force . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , represents the sql .    in fig.[fig1 ] we show @xmath63 as function of the ( scaled ) time when the force is on . </S>",
    "<S> the improved sensitivity due to the probes correlations is especially evident for @xmath64 . above this limit , the meters back action noise becomes dominant , thus reducing the benefit . </S>",
    "<S> such back - action noise could be reduced by decreasing the value of @xmath65 , i.e. , the intensity of the meter fields , but this also affects the strength of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it turns out that , for each @xmath50 , there exist an optimum value of @xmath65 as shown in fig.[fig2 ] . also notice in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that the entanglement condition , @xmath31 , alllows to beat the sql ( bottom curves ) . with the present model , the sensitivity of the force measurement crucially depends on the value of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is related the optomechanical coupling constant @xmath8 and on the intensity of the entangler field @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the parameters values used in experiments of ref.@xcite permit to reach @xmath67 , which would allow to beat the sql , even with @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also to remark that the achievable improvements are not uniform in the phase space , since we have assumed the phase @xmath34 locked to the time duration @xmath50 of the force in eq.([eq : phiopt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have a kind of two - mode squeezed state , and the situation is analogous to the use of a single - mode squeezed state , where the direction of the reduced uncertainty should coincide with the one of the force displacement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enforces the conclusions of ref.@xcite , about the equivalence of entanglement and squeeezing , while the more optimistic results of ref.@xcite are not applicable in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we would remark however that probes entangled state seems experimentally accessible with present technology while probes squeezed state does not .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the entangler has been considered turned off prior the measurement , what will really limit the applicability of the above procedure would be the decoherence , which degrades the prepared meters state . </S>",
    "<S> such a decoherence takes place in a time scale @xmath69 @xcite with @xmath70 the mechanical relaxation time of the probes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the time for rotation @xmath34 , together with the duration @xmath50 of the force , should be less than @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> . thus , the model would be suitable for weak but impulsive forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> favorable conditions for its implementation could be found in micro electro - mechanical systems @xcite , or atomic force microscopes @xcite , where large mechanical quality factors are achievable .    summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed high - sensitivity force measurement by exploiting nonclassical features of the probes , like entanglement . that would allow us to overcome the uncertainty related to the probes state and even to beat the sql . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme , even if oversimplified , may open new perspectives in quantum metrology @xcite , as well as in gravitational waves detection @xcite . </S>"
