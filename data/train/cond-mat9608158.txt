    "<S> the understanding of quantum transport in these very small systems has been advanced by the landauer theory@xcite of one - dimensional transport . in cases where multi - probes are attached to the conductor </S>",
    "<S> , bttiker has provided the useful formula for computing various conductances@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the landauer - bttiker formalism has been applied to a large class of quantum transport problems in the mesoscopic and ballistic regimes where the external potential is static . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when external potential has a time - dependent oscillating component , the landauer - bttiker formalism can not be directly applied . as shown by bttiker and his co - workers@xcite that a direct application of the original approach of landauer - bttiker formalism , where the internal electric potential distribution is not needed , can not yield electric current and charge conservation . </S>",
    "<S> hence the coherent quantum transport theory for mesoscopic and ballistic conductors must be extended when time - varying external potentials are to be included . clearly </S>",
    "<S> the problem of computing frequency dependent conductance for mesoscopic and ballistic conductors is a very important subject from both theoretical and application points of view .    </S>",
    "<S> recently in a series of articles , bttiker and co - workers@xcite have developed a theoretical formalism for investigating frequency - dependent coherent quantum transport for mesoscopic and ballistic conductors when electric potential in the leads far away from the scattering region of the conductor is time varying . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important advance in the theory of mesoscopic physics and warrant further development of the theory and application . in </S>",
    "<S> simple one dimensional systems such as a @xmath0function potential , a perfect quantum wire , or an 1d quantum well , the frequency dependent admittance can be explicitly calculated since the scattering matrix can be obtained analytically@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in truly 2d systems the application of the formalism is less straightforward . this is due partly to technical difficulties of computing certain quantities such as the various partial density of states ( pdos , see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities , which appear naturally in the theoretical formulation of the problem@xcite , have deep physical meaning which is not obviously clear and needs to be revealed . </S>",
    "<S> to the best of our knowledge , there are so far no studies and direct calculations@xcite of the various partial density of states in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> but these quantities must be obtained if the frequency dependent admittance is to be computed from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to report our investigations on the dynamic transport properties of a 2d quantum wire system .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider a t - shaped quantum wire structure as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two probes extend to @xmath1 while the scattering region is provided by the t - shaped junction as shown being bounded by the two dotted lines . </S>",
    "<S> this 2d quantum wire has been studied by many authors@xcite for the case of static transport . while this is a simple 2d system </S>",
    "<S> , we found that much physical intuition about various quantities can be obtained for the dynamic transport ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the frequency dependent admittance for this system using the current conserving formalism of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correction to the dc - conductance due to a time - dependent potential is related to the local partial density of states which we compute numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the current conservation is explicitly confirmed by computing the global density of states and comparing it with a quantity which is related to the electron dwell time . </S>",
    "<S> our direct calculation clearly reveals the physical meaning of the partial density of states which plays an essential role in the dynamic transport theory .    for the sake of presentation we briefly review the current conserving dynamic transport formalism of bttiker , thomas , prtre , gasparian and christen@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their theory proceeds in three steps . </S>",
    "<S> the first step is to determine the current and charge density response of the system to the time - variation of the external potential . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an admittance matrix with elements given by , to first order in @xmath2 , @xmath3 where the first term on the right hand side is the admittance ( conductance ) when frequency @xmath4 and this term is given by the usual bttiker multi - probe conductance formula@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second term gives a correction due to the time - dependence of the external potential , and is determined by the global partial density of states@xcite ( global pdos ) , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> here the indices @xmath6 denote scattering from a probe labeled by @xmath7 to that labeled by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this admittance matrix @xmath9 does not conserve current , since @xmath10 . to correct this problem </S>",
    "<S> , one must consider the internal potential distribution induced by the external perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> this is computed in the second step of the theory@xcite , and the result is rather simple if only thomas - fermi linear screening is included . in the final step , </S>",
    "<S> one computes the currents in the probes induced by this internal potential distribution , which leads to an additional term in the admittance matrix . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total admittance is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 \\left[\\frac{dn({\\bf r})}{de}\\right]^{-1 } \\left[\\frac{dn({\\bf r},\\beta)}{de}\\right]\\ \\ \\ . \\label{dab}\\ ] ] in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dab ] ) the quantity @xmath14 is the _ injectivity _ which measures the additional local charge density brought into the sample by the oscillating chemical potential at probe @xmath8 . without a magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> the _ emissivity _ @xmath15 equals to the injectivity . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown@xcite that these quantities could be computed from the electron dwell time or the scattering green function . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the total local density of states is @xmath16 . with these expressions , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the final formula for the frequency dependent admittance to linear order in @xmath2 , @xmath17 it is now straightforward to prove that current is conserved since the admittance matrix @xmath18 satisfies @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen by realizing that @xmath20 is the injectance which is identical to @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> let s apply this formalism to the t - shaped 2d conductor . </S>",
    "<S> the incident electron comes from probe 1 , it scatters at the t - junction , and then reflects back to probe 1 or transmits to probe 2 . to be concrete </S>",
    "<S> we have fixed the wire width to be @xmath22 , the width and height of the side stub are fixed at @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the units are fixed by @xmath26 with @xmath27 the effective mass of the electron , and lengths measured in terms of @xmath22 . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we have focused on the first _ transport _ subband only , thus the incoming electron energy is restricted : @xmath28 . in this case elements of the scattering matrix @xmath29 are simple complex numbers . with more than one subbands </S>",
    "<S> they become matrices in the subband space . </S>",
    "<S> however the computation proceeds in similar fashion with one or more than one subbands . </S>",
    "<S> we have solved the quantum scattering problem using a mode matching method@xcite , where the wavefunction in the scattering region was expanded using a suitable basis set and in particular @xmath30 modes were included . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked the convergence that including more modes in the scattering region essentially does not change the results . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering probabilities were obtained by matching the wavefunctions and their derivatives at the boundaries between the scattering region and the probes .    to compute the admittance we need to know various partial density of states . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities turn out to have very interesting and physically clear property once they are plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the global pdos is related to the scattering matrix , and is approximately given by@xcite @xmath31 for a finite scattering volume there are corrections to this expression of the order @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electron wavelength and @xmath34 the system size@xcite . for large system sizes or large energies , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gpdos ] ) is adequate . </S>",
    "<S> later when we check the current conservation , the correction term will be added . since in 2d </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the scattering matrix can not be written down analytically , we have decided to perform the energy derivatives of ( [ gpdos ] ) numerically . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we computed @xmath35 at various values of energy @xmath36 and used a @xmath37-point numerical derivative to find @xmath38 . the behavior of the global pdos is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) together with the transmission coefficient @xmath39 . as our quantum wire system is very transmissive , @xmath40 has large values in general except at the two resonance levels where @xmath41 . in a previous work we have shown that the energies where @xmath41 corresponds to the quasi - bound states located in the t - junction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the global partial density of states coincides well with that of the transmission coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> in particular @xmath42 , which is the global pdos for reflection , peaks at the energies where transmission coefficient is minimum or reflection maximum . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 , which is the global pdos for transmission , takes minimum value when @xmath44 is minimum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a general discussion for an one - dimensional system with a symmetric scatterer@xcite reveals that @xmath45 while @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath44 the reflection and transmission coefficients , and @xmath48 the global dos . </S>",
    "<S> hence these quantities have vivid physical meaning .    </S>",
    "<S> the next quantity of interest is @xmath49 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dab ] ) . to compute this quantity </S>",
    "<S> , we first find the injectivity which is given by the scattering wavefunction@xcite in the t - junction , at zero temperature this is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the incoming particle flux . </S>",
    "<S> clearly a spatial integration of this quantity gives the electron dwell time@xcite @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> in general @xmath49 is obtained with two calculations of the wavefunction for particles coming from left and from right . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) shows this quantity as a function of the electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath53 and @xmath54 peak at the energies where the transmission takes the minimum values . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable since these special energies correspond to the scattering states@xcite where the electron dwell time takes maximum value , and the injectivity represents essentially the electron dwelling in an area @xmath55 at position @xmath56 irrespective where it is finally scattered .    with the global partial density states and the quantity @xmath49 calculated , we have thus obtained the admittance @xmath57 from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ge ] ) , ( [ gi ] ) , and ( [ gfinal ] ) . fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) shows the @xmath2-dependent part of @xmath18 , @xmath58 as a function of energy @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the prefactor @xmath59 , this quantity @xmath60 is the imaginary part of the admittance , and is called _ emittance_. at the quasi - bound state levels where transmission coefficient @xmath39 takes minimum values , @xmath61 also takes extremal values . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe that the transmissive part @xmath62 takes minimum value where @xmath63 , while the reflective part @xmath64 takes maximum value at the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus in this sense , the dynamic part of the admittance @xmath65 has the same behavior as the static admittance @xmath66 as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath65 changes sign as energy is varied : the system responds either capacitively when @xmath67 , or inductively otherwise . hence at the resonance ( where @xmath68 for our system ) @xmath62 and @xmath64 are capacitive . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) shows the clear crossover between the capcitive and inductive responses for this 2d quantum wire as energy is changed . </S>",
    "<S> we can now explicitly confirm the current conservation by summing up the admittance matrix elements and check whether or not @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> since the global pdos obtained using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gpdos ] ) is not exact , a correction should be added . </S>",
    "<S> for an 1d system gasparian _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al._@xcite have shown that @xmath70 where @xmath36 is the electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately for a 2d system such as ours , the green s function can not be written down analytically hence how to derive a similar correction term as that in ( [ conservation ] ) is unclear . </S>",
    "<S> however since we have numerical results of all the quantities , a reasonable correction term can easily be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the same form as ( [ conservation ] ) led to almost perfect current conservation , provided we use the _ transport _ energy @xmath71 as the energy @xmath36 in ( [ conservation ] ) . our data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) clearly and unambiguously shows that the following is established @xmath72 with this result , we have thus explicitly shown@xcite the current conservation @xmath73 . since the correction term is inversely proportional to @xmath71 , it plays a role only at small @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this can already be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) where the two curves add up to zero except at low energies .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have , for the first time , implemented the current conserving dynamic conductance formalism for 2d metallic conductors . in the simple case of applying thomas - fermi linear screening for the interacting electrons ( hence the analysis is more suitable for metallic samples ) , the current response to the internal potential can be computed from the electron dwell time using the scattering wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependent admittance of a t - shaped 2d quantum wire is calculated to linear order in frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we have explicitly confirmed the electric current conservation and found that a correction to the total density of states is needed at low energies , in the same fashion as that of 1d case . </S>",
    "<S> it is very interesting to clarify the physical meaning of the partial dos . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities provide information on the density of carriers _ and _ the transmission of carriers from one contact to another . at quantum resonances </S>",
    "<S> these quantities take extremal values . </S>",
    "<S> there are many further applications of this important theoretical formalism , to situations involving multi - mode , magnetic fields , and non - linear screening . </S>",
    "<S> another very challenging extension is to push the theory to higher order in frequency@xcite and formulate the theory in a way that permits a computational implementation . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to be able to report these results in the future . </S>"
