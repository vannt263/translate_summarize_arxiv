    "flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum over a wide range of timescales ranging from fractions of second to years is an important characteristic of astrophysical objects powered by active black holes .",
    "the temporal variability has been found to be stochastic and widely believed to be a result of a complex and dynamic interplay between the magnetic field , black hole spin , and accreting plasma as well as relativistic jet ( if present ) .",
    "well sampled time series analysis of these sources show similar features albeit at different timescales , lending support to understanding that similar processes are powering the emission at the base level ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , based on these and other similarities , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , hosting supermassive black holes ( smbhs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been claimed to be a scaled - up versions of galactic x - ray binaries hosting stellar mass black holes @xcite .",
    "blazars , consisting of bl lacertae objects ( bll ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are subclass of radio - loud agn with emission dominated by relativistic jet beamed towards us .",
    "they are characterized by a high flux variability across the entire accessible electromagnetic spectrum on timescales ranging from minutes to years with a high degree of polarization at radio and optical energies which often changes with changes in the source flux states .",
    "additionally , high - resolution imaging in radio wavebands show superluminal features across the jet @xcite . despite a wide range in temporal variability timescales ,",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) show a characteristic broad double - hump profile with a low energy peak between infrared ( ir ) to ultraviolet ( uv)/x - rays while the other at @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "emission from other components e.g. disk , corona , torus , line emitting regions etc . have also been observed in few sources but almost always sub - dominant compared to the jet emission .",
    "the low energy hump of the sed is well understood to be synchrotron radiation from relativistic non - thermal distribution of electrons ( or pairs ) , while two schools of thought : leptonic and hadronic , exist for emission at the high energy hump .",
    "the former attributes the high energy emission to inverse compton processes @xcite while the latter attributes it to hadron - photon initiated cascades and/or proton synchrotron @xcite",
    ". irrespective of the origin , emission from blazars have been found to be stochastic , similar to other agn and galactic x - ray binaries @xcite with reports of quasi - periodicity as well @xcite .",
    "study of long - term behavior of variability in blazars , however , is highly dependent on the simultaneous coverage of source over a broad spectrum .",
    "but , for @xmath0-ray bright blazars , the continuous scanning of entire sky every @xmath2 3 hours between 0.1 - 300 gev by the _",
    "fermi_-lat and coordinated multi - wavelength follow - ups by observatories supporting _ fermi _ provides an unprecedented amount of data for such studies .",
    "flares are loosely defined as the brightening of source emission regardless of the nature of physical processes causing the brightening , and was first introduced in the context of emission from the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has a different meaning in context of different class of sources and spans a wide range in spectral / flux and temporal domains . in the spectral / flux domain ,",
    "the distribution of various flares characteristics varies dramatically across different sources e.g. solar flare peak x - ray fluxes show a power - law distribution ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) while galactic x - ray binaries exhibit a lognormal distribution on sub second timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in blazars ,",
    "flares are generally defined using the flux doubling and halving timescales @xcite , and encode the characteristics of processes happening in the jet . as a result",
    ", flux distribution of blazars in different activity states has been investigated in many studies to understand the nature of emission processes and jet connection with central engine . however , a systematic study of flux distribution has been lacking in blazars , mainly due to inhomogeneous sampling and their stochastic variability nature .",
    "additionally , such studies demand a well sampled source variability states including both flaring and quiescent states to perform a meaningful statistical analysis .    here , we report a systematic study of the long - term multi - wavelength flux distribution of fsrq pks 1510 - 089 ,  located at the redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "the study is made feasible due to near - continuous detection of pks 1510 - 089  in the lat band over a 3-days time - bin .",
    "further , it shows many flaring states compared to other sources with similar continuous detections in lat ( in preparation ) .",
    "this , in turn , also allowed us to access the sampling effects in different energy bands and thus , validate the robustness of our results .",
    "pks 1510 - 089 is one of the most extensively monitored blazars at all wavelengths accessible from the ground and space under the _ _ fermi agn science : multiwavelength observing - support programs _ _ to understand the enigmatic agn .",
    "the continuous scanning of the sky by _ fermi _ and the corresponding multi - wavelength near - continuous follow - ups from the ground have generated vast amount of well sampled data . since blazar variability is stochastic @xcite , we have mainly used simultaneous / contemporaneous multi - wavelength data from @xmath0-ray to optical - ir except at x - rays where we have used rxte due to lack of well sampled data by the _ swift _ observatory .",
    "the details of data archives and resources used are summarized in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    ".multi - wavelength data and resources . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sedparval ]",
    "our systematic analysis of multi - wavelength flux distribution of fsrq pks 1510 - 089 , having well sampled flux states ( figure [ fig : histcomspec ] top panel ) reveals that @xmath0-rays to ir - optical emission follow a bi - lognormal distribution except x - ray , which conforms to a single lognormal distribution .",
    "such bimodality at @xmath0-ray energies has been expected from extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egb ) study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude ratio is @xmath1 , close to the one anticipated ( @xmath4 ) by @xcite .",
    "further , the mean spectral index during the high state ( 2.29@xmath50.01 , 0.086@xmath50.004 ) is relatively harder than the low state ( 2.40@xmath50.01 , 0.30@xmath50.02 ) , but both ( @xmath6 only ) are consistent with the observed distribution of indices inferred from the statistical studies of lat blazars @xcite . in terms of contribution to egb , blazars account for almost all above 100 gev and @xmath2 50% ( fsrq : @xmath2 35% , bl - lac : @xmath2 17% ) below it with the rest accounted by other lat detected sources @xcite .",
    "similar studies , performed so far on bl lac class of sources have shown both single as well as bi - lognormal distributions . the x - ray profile found here",
    "is also seen in bl lacertae .",
    "similarly , a single lognormal profile in multi - wavelength have been found for pks 2155 - 304 @xcite except for the single flaring instance of 2006 at @xmath7 gev , inclusion of which results in a bi - lognormal profile at @xmath0-rays . here , however , we have found flux distribution with a bi - lognormal distribution at ir - optical as well as @xmath0-rays ( 0.1 - 300 gev ) with light curves showing many flaring instances of varied flux levels in different energy bands .",
    "this bi - modality seems to be similar to the two basic spectral states , ( low / hard and high / soft ) that are observed in x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , these spectral transitions in x - ray binaries occur on timescales of days / months . scaling this time - scale for",
    "a @xmath8 smbh would lead to @xmath9 years @xcite , significantly longer than the days - to - weeks transitions reported here .",
    "the intrinsic rms variability during the two states exhibits a complex energy dependent behavior ( figure [ fig : histcomspec ] , bottom - left ) with remarkably different multi - wavelength flux dispersions .",
    "the @xmath0-ray low and high state flux dispersions are consistent with each other ( table [ tab:2gausspar ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the b - band dispersions .",
    "however , the @xmath0-ray dispersion is comparatively wider than the ir - optical and x - ray during the low state , but similar to ir - optical dispersions during the high state except for the b - band .",
    "further , the dispersion increases towards ir bands during the low state suggesting more variability at ir bands than optical . additionally , the ir - optical distributions exhibit significant high flux tails ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histcomspec ] , top - right panel ) , even after averaging over lat binning durations , contrary to the x - ray and @xmath0-ray distributions .",
    "the sed modeling requires both blr and ir - torus ( @xmath2 820 k , * ? ? ? * ) to reproduce the 0.1 - 10 gev emission in leptonic scenario with bulk lorentz factor being mainly responsible for variation .",
    "this is also consistent with @xmath0-ray dispersion being wider ( blr - ir boosted by square of bulk lorentz factor ) than ir - optical which is synchrotron radiation . on the other hand , similar high state dispersions at all energies except b",
    "- band suggest both underlying particle spectrum and magnetic field playing a dynamic role .",
    "the high flux tails of ir - optical distributions , however , favor magnetic field , indicating a shock origin for the high flux states .",
    "similar high and low state dispersions in b - band , on the other hand , is result of disk emission being dominant during both as suggested by the high state sed and rms spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histcomspec ] ) .",
    "the single lognormal distribution for x - ray from rxte is consistent with 3 - 20 kev flux not as strongly variable as the ir - optical and @xmath0-ray emission and is mainly a result of emission from low energy part of the particle spectrum .",
    "we disfavor a substantial coronal contribution at x - ray for single lognormal distribution as even in that case a bimodal distribution is expected as seen in the optical b - band ( corona connected with the disk ) .",
    "a lognormal distribution of flux implies emission being powered by cascade / multiplicative processes rather than additive . in black hole powered sources like seyfert galaxies and x - ray binaries ,",
    "lognormality is widely believed to be a result of fluctuations in the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "thus , a lognormal flux distribution in blazars may be an imprint of modulation in the disk , connecting jet to disk activity .",
    "additionally , a lognormal distribution is also expected for plasma ejection triggered by local magnetic reconnections ( see eg .",
    "* ) , but contribute negligibly to blazars emission @xcite .",
    "most of emission is from the jet @xcite , mainly from the blazar zone where the plasma collimates , probably by the action of large - scale guiding magnetic fields and/or external medium , as inferred from the m87 jet @xcite .",
    "the cascades of magnetic energy to particles proceed probably via reconnection first , leading to further development via turbulence and shocks .",
    "a reconnection mediated channeling of energy to particles , however , results at most to an equipartition of energy between the two , in contradiction with the sed modeling of blazars emission which almost always suggests particle dominated jets @xcite .",
    "it is , though , consistent with relativistic fluid approach of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a lognormal distribution also suggests an existence of some characteristic energy scale that manifests into radiative form .",
    "this may be related to the power being injected into the jet .",
    "the apparent large flux variations , on the other hand , may be related to the efficiency of underlying processes channeling energy among themselves and finally to non - thermal particles at the blazar zone and/or within the jet .",
    "apart from active bhs , coronal mass ejection from the sun , known to be a result of magnetic reconnection also follow a lognormal distribution @xcite .",
    "the observed lognormality , thus , may well be an imprint of disk modulation as seen in x - ray binaries and seyfert galaxies , and/or a convolution of plasma exhaust due to local magnetic reconnections .",
    "the authors thank the referee for a thorough report .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , maintained by nasa s goddard space flight center and an up - to - date smarts optical / near - infrared light curves available at www.astro.yale.edu/smarts/glast/home.php ."
