    "radio - loud ( rl ) and radio quiet ( rq ) agns exist at all luminosities .",
    "the distinction between the two classes is usually made by using the so - called radio loudness parameter @xmath4 , i.e. the ratio between the radio flux at 5ghz and the optical flux in the b band . while powerful rl and rq quasars quasars typically separate at values of @xmath5 , at the lowest luminosities , the transition occurs at a much higher value ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "the general interpretation is that the output of radio - loud nuclei is energetically dominated by the jet , while that of radio - quiet agns is mostly dominated by the accretion disc .",

    "such energetically dominant jets and others do not ?",
    "how are the mass and the spin of the central smbh related to the radio - loudness ?",
    "these questions are central not only for a complete understanding of the agn phenomenon but also to assess the role of the central supermassive black hole in the evolution of the galaxy , the rise of a `` radio phase '' and its impact on the evolution of the galaxy itself and on the environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "jets are most likely formed by extracting rotational energy from the black hole and the accretion disc through magnetic forces @xcite .",
    "jet production may also help to remove angular momentum and drag material towards the black hole .",
    "understanding under which physical conditions accreting black holes are capable of producing some sort of collimated outflow is not the only critical point .",
    "it is more crucial to understand which mechanism may be able to produce a ( relativistic ) jet whose radiative output is a significant fraction of the accretion luminosity , and which may even become the dominant source of radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the jet power is somehow related to the spin of the black hole , as the b - z mechanism clearly establishes @xcite .",
    "however , other parameters such as the magnetic field and , possibly , the mass of the black hole , may also come into play .",
    "significant effort has been devoted to investigate such an issue , but no general consensus has yet been reached .",
    "@xcite found a tight correlation of the black hole mass with radio power in a sample of local agns ; @xcite studied a sample of pg qsos , and set a limit for radio loud objects at m@xmath6 , a similar result being found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the distribution of l@xmath7}$ ] for radio loud agn extends to higher luminosities than that of radio quiet sources , and noted that such a result is consistent with a higher `` maximum '' black hole mass in radio loud agns .",

    "such correction increases bh mass estimates in agn with significant luminosities compared to their bh mass .    in this paper , we build on the results shown in @xcite and we further investigate the relationship between the mass of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and the radio loudness of the active nucleus using samples of agns at all luminosities , and bh mass estimates obtained with different methods . in sect .",

    "samples 1 , 2 and 3 have been studied in detail in @xcite and more details about those samples can be found in that paper .",
    "the sample of nearby ellipticals ( 4 ) partially overlaps with samples 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "however , there are only 10 objects in common , so the total number of objects considered here is 142 .",
    "note that being selected according to different criteria , these objects do not constitute a complete sample .",
    "however , they well represent the overall properties of all kinds of low power active nuclei in the local universe .",
    "we do not discuss in detail the sample of @xcite , which also claimed to find radio - loud agns associated with low mass black holes , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the sample partially overlaps with the @xcite and @xcite samples , which we consider here .",
    "secondly , the work by @xcite includes a significant number of type  2 agns .",
    "for all sources , the nuclear luminosity was estimated using an indirect indicator ( i.e. the luminosity of the hbeta line ) .",
    "that might produce results that are inconsistent with those obtained for the samples we include in this paper .",
    "we focus on samples of radio selected radio - loud qsos taken from @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which were found to include a significant number of smbh with estimated mass lower than @xmath19 .",
    "the sample of @xcite comprises flat - spectrum radio loud quasars .",
    "these objects might be significantly affected by relativistic beaming , which enhances the radiation both in the radio and in the optical .",
    "the redshifts of all qsos in the above samples are in the range @xmath20 .",
    "we also consider the sample of high - z ( @xmath21 ) qsos of @xcite , which includes very luminous ( @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 ) quasars of both radio - loud and radio - quiet class .",
    "note that all of the above samples of quasars were included in the study of smbh masses in agn made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also include in our analysis the sample of `` broad lined '' agns from @xcite(and references therein ) , which consists of objects selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( dr5 , * ? ? ?",

    "however , higher luminosity objects ( @xmath26 erg s@xmath23 ) are also represented in the sample .",
    "the smbh masses for the objects belonging to the samples considered here are estimated using different methods , from gas kinematics to single epoch estimates based on scaling relations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the bh masses of llagns taken from @xcite are derived using either the relation with the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite or more direct measurements from , e.g. , gas kinematics taken from the literature . for a fraction of the seyfert  1 galaxies ( the brightest objects belonging to that sample ) , the estimates were made using reverberation mapping .",
    "more details for the samples of fris , seyferts and liners can be found in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for the samples of early - type galaxies of @xcite the bh mass estimates are made using the relation of @xcite .",
    "black hole masses for 3cr blrg are also derived using the same method , with the only exception of 3c390.3 for which we used data from reverberation mapping @xcite . for these llagn samples we use the smbh masses from the literature since the updated scaling relations do not provide significantly different values for those objects .",
    "furthermore , we note that the updated relation between the bh mass and the central velocity dispersion provided by @xcite does not return values significantly different from those obtained with the @xcite formula , for the purpose of this work .    in the following",
    "we will also make use of the relation between bh mass and near - ir host spheroid luminosity @xcite .",
    "such relation has a scatter similar to the relation with the stellar velocity dispersion , and has therefore a similar accuracy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bh virial masses for all of the above qso samples published in the literature were derived using single epoch estimates based on scaling relations .",
    "the formulae typically use the fwhm of a broad emission line ( usually h@xmath27 or h@xmath28 , and more rarely civ ) and the luminosity of the adjacent continuum as crucial parameters .",
    "those relations are calibrated using calibrated using low - z type  1 agns of a broad range of luminosities for which the bh masses are know from reverberation mapping techniques ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    here",
    "we first estimate the bh masses for all qsos using the most updated formulae @xcite , calibrated to up - to - date reverberation mapping masses . furthermore , as noted by @xcite , the radiation from the accretion disc exerts pressure on the broad line clouds which opposes the gravitational attraction of the black hole .",
    "therefore , in particular for the more luminous quasars , the blr may actually experience a smaller `` effective '' gravitational field .",
    "thus the mass of the bh might be underestimated when using single epoch estimates and the fwhm of broad emission lines such as h@xmath27 and h@xmath28 as crucial parameters . @xcite",
    "calibrated the effects of radiation pressure on the blr . in this paper",
    "we use the most up - to - date version of the radiation pressure - corrected virial relation to estimate bh masses ( marconi et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "the formula we use is the following :    @xmath29    where we use h@xmath27 when measurements of h@xmath28 are not available .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 , correspond to the @xmath10 and @xmath32 coefficients in @xcite , respectively .",
    "the values used in this work have been improved based on new data , but they do not significantly differ from the original values .",
    "the presence of outward radiation forces on blr clouds is an unavoidable physical effect due to the injection of momentum from the absorption of ionizing photons ; its effect on virial mass estimates is negligible only if one makes the ( unlikely ) assumption that all blr clouds have very large column densities @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the motions of blr clouds under the combined effects of gravity and radiation pressure .",
    "they concluded that , even if radiation pressure is important , bh masses derived from the simple virial product are not significantly underestimated .",
    "however , that conclusion strongly depends on the assumption that blr clouds are moving in pressure equilibrium within a confining medium , whose assumed pressure gradient tunes cloud column densities during their orbits .",
    "all clouds must survive several dynamical timescales ( i.e. must complete several orbits ) so that on average the virial product will not be affected by radiation pressure .",
    "some kind of magnetic confinement is invoked for the clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but overall it is not clear from this model how can the clouds avoid rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover the only direct observations of the structure of blr clouds based on eclipsing of the x - ray agn source suggest a cometary like structure , as expected from supersonic motions of dense clouds in a less dense medium , and indicate a short lifetimes of blr clouds , less than the orbital time scale @xcite",
    ". a detailed discussion of these issues will be subject of a forthcoming paper ( marconi et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "see also sect .",
    "[ onmarconi ] for a short discussion about the impact of such a correction on our results .",
    "in fig .  [ llagnfig ] we plot the estimated bh mass vs. the radio loudness parameter @xmath4 for the samples of nearby llagn .",
    "the properties of the objects belonging to that sample are well defined , thus allowing us to derive robust results .",
    "most importantly , their nuclear emission can be resolved by using the vla and hst for the radio and the optical bands , respectively .",
    "this allows us a direct comparison between their faint nuclei and the nuclei of powerful quasars , minimizing the contributions of the host galaxy stellar emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "seyferts are plotted as triangles , power - law galaxies as stars , liners as squares , fr  is as filled circles , core - galaxies citeplauer95 . ] as empty circles , and blrgs as pentagons .",
    "the first piece of information that is important to bear in mind is that at low agn powers , the `` separation '' between rq and rl nuclei occurs at a much higher value of the radio loudness parameter @xcite than for powerful qsos .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is still unclear .",
    "@xcite showed that such a separation is a function of the eddington ratio @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that a change in the nuclear sed , corresponding to , e.g. , a change in some of the physical properties of the accretion disc , might result in a different value of @xmath4 for the transition between a jet - dominated and a disk - dominated agn .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of this subject is beyond the subject of this paper .    the dashed line at @xmath35 in fig .  [ llagnfig ]",
    "is drawn with the purpose of visually separating objects for which the optical emission is disc - dominated ( radio - quiet , left - hand side of the plot ) from objects that are jet - dominated ( radio - loud , right - hand side ) .",
    "note that blrg ( blue pentagons ) are present in both sides of the plane .",
    "this is due to the fact that blrg are objects seen at intermediate viewing angles with respect to the jet direction ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , most likely because of relativistic beaming effects , in some of those objects the jet dominates the optical emission , while in others the jet radiation is `` de - beamed '' and the disc is bright enough to overshine the jet .",
    "their location may also be affected by variability .",
    "however , independently of their location , it is clear that those are `` intrinsically '' radio - loud objects , i.e. they do produce powerful relativistic jets , irrespective of the observed dominant radiation source .    as already noted by @xcite , all rl llagn",
    "are associated with bh masses @xmath36 m@xmath37 , while most of the rq population has lower bh masses .",
    "a similar result has been recently found by @xcite .",
    "there seems to be a `` region of avoidance '' , in the bottom - right part of the plot , as radio - loud llagn with small black hole mass are absent we plot only the detected nuclei .",
    "a number of objects with upper limits to the optical emission are present among the core galaxies and the liner sample .",
    "however , all core galaxies in the balmaverde sample have bh mass @xmath36 , therefore the exact value of r is irrelevant for the purpose of this work .",
    "only 3 liners with detected radio emission have undetected optical nuclei .",
    "that is most likely explained as due to the high surface brightness of the central region of the host galaxies ( see e.g. the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "this leaves our conclusions unaltered . ] .",
    "while it is clear that radio quiet agn exist at all bh masses , the question is whether radio loud agn associated with small bh masses exist at all .",
    "note the location of the seyfert galaxy mcg63015 on the left hand side of the plane , at a bh mass of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this is an extremely important object , since it is probably the most compelling example of maximally spinning smbh in agn ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a high bh spin has been often claimed to be the origin of radio - loudness @xcite , but mcg63015 is radio quiet .",
    "however , the bh mass is at least 1 dex smaller than any rl agn in these samples .",
    "this points to the idea that the spin alone can not give rise to radio loudness and is consistent with the suggestion presented in this paper ( see sect .",
    "[ discussion ] ) .",
    "while it is clear that the above results hold for the selected ( although well defined ) sample of objects , the question is whether it can be extended to larger samples of objects and for agns of higher luminosity . in order to do so , in fig .",
    "[ qsofig ] we plot the samples of qsos described in sec .  2.2 .",
    "these are particularly important samples , since relatively small black hole virial masses ( @xmath39 m@xmath37 ) have been estimated in the literature for a significant fraction of objects .",

    "although the number of objects with m@xmath43 m@xmath37 is significantly smaller than found in the above cited papers as a result of the updated formulae we used in this paper , a few objects are still present in the radio - loud and small bh mass region of the plane ( see fig .

    "a number of `` radio - loud '' agns associated with small bh masses have been found in that sample .",

    "note that this assumption may not be true for the lowest luminosity objects , in which the stellar emission from the host galaxy may dominate the optical flux at that wavelength .",

    "first of all , we note that the most luminous agns ( l@xmath47 erg s@xmath23 ) are all associated with large bh masses m@xmath48 m@xmath37 .",
    "the objects appear to be clustered in the rq region ( left hand side ) and the peak of the agn radio - loudness distribution appears to shift from @xmath49 r@xmath50 for agns of very low h@xmath27 luminosities , to @xmath49 r@xmath51 at the highest luminosities . assuming log r = 1 as the rq / rl threshold , the percentage of rl objects increases from @xmath52 for objects with @xmath53 erg s@xmath23 to 65% in the luminosity bin between @xmath54 erg s@xmath23 and @xmath55 erg s@xmath23 . even if we can not infer the actual fraction of radio - loud agns from that sample , it is unlikely that the apparent lack of high luminosity radio loud agns ( m@xmath56 , r@xmath57 , l@xmath58 erg s@xmath23 ) with respect to lower luminosity objects is due to a selection effect .",
    "in fact , the sample could in principle be biased against distant radio quiet objects , but the radio loud ones are certainly not affected . therefore , that just confirms that the rq / rl dividing line shifts towards higher values of r for objects of decreasing luminosity . in fact , if we assume @xmath49 r = 2 for the rq / rl division in the lowest luminosity bin , the percentage of rl objects returns to a more reasonable value of @xmath59 .",

    "is extremely uncertain , and they are in fact both classified as `` galaxy '' in the sdss .",
    "the remaining five galaxies have fwhm(h@xmath27 ) between 1000 and 2000 km s@xmath23 . for j164442.53 + 261913.2 , after taking into account of the effects of radiation pressure , the estimated bh mass is @xmath76 m@xmath69 .",

    "in fact , the sdss spectra show that the [ oiii]5007 line is the same as ( or even slightly broader than ) the permitted lines .",
    "this most likely implies that the line emission region lies outside the blr , and thus out of the sphere of influence of the black hole .",
    "summarizing , a careful inspection of the large sample of low - z agns from the sdss shows that there is no clear evidence for _ bona fide _ radio loud objects associated with black hole masses significantly smaller than @xmath77 m@xmath37 .",
    "the smallest bh associated with a radio - loud object we find is sdss j115409.27 + 023815.0 , for which the estimated bh mass is @xmath78 m@xmath37 . in other words ,",
    "even the lowest bh mass we estimate is still compatible with @xmath44 m@xmath37 , within the typical error .      in the previous paragraphs",
    "we have described the methods we use to estimate the bh masses for various objects in the different samples . in doing so",

    "although we strongly believe that that is the correct approach , we must point out that the overall results of this paper are unaltered if we neglect radiation pressure effects .",
    "in fact , using @xcite for the sdss objects for which we used the @xcite formula ( the ones marked with `` a '' and `` d '' in table 1 ) , we still obtain that the lowest bh mass is @xmath76 m@xmath69 ( for j115409.27 + 023815.0 ) .",
    "this is because those sources are all low luminosity agns , therefore the effects of radiation pressure are small . to be precise",
    ", the marconi formula , in that case , returns an even smaller value of the bh mass than the one obtained with the vestergaard formula , which neglects radiation pressure effects at all luminosities .    among the samples of agn considered in this paper , the only objects that would be inconsistent ( assuming a factor of @xmath79 error on the bh mass estimate ) with the `` limit '' at @xmath44 solar masses are four qsos in the @xcite sample .",
    "however , for those four objects , the classification as type  1 agns is extremely uncertain .",
    "three out of those four are in fact classified as type  2 ( ned ) and one ( 1045 - 188 ) is an fsrq .",
    "going back to the original paper that reports the spectrum of that object @xcite and the values used for deriving its bh mass , we see that the fwhm of h@xmath28 is quoted to be smaller than that of the [ oiii]5007 line .",
    "furthermore , a note states that the h@xmath28 line is blended with some athmospheric absorption features .",
    "we conclude that even without using the @xcite correction , there is no clear evidence for radio loud agns associated with masses smaller than @xmath80 m@xmath37 .",
    "using the most updated black hole mass estimators , we have shown that there is no evidence for a population of radio - loud agn associated with supermassive black holes of m @xmath81 m@xmath37 , in agreement with previous work performed on different samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "building on this finding , we propose that the rq / rl dichotomy can be explained by a modification of the spin paradigm in which the radio loudness of an agn is determined not only by the spin , but also by the mass of the smbh .",
    "rl agn are only those with bh masses larger than @xmath80 m@xmath37 . clearly , it is still possible that the value of @xmath44 m@xmath37 does not correspond to any specific threshold , and it could just represent a typical value below which the probably of having a radio loud source becomes increasingly small .    while a discussion on the physics of the jet production is beyond the scope of this paper , in the following we will present evidences in support of our conjecture , and we will discuss the consequences for the relations between bhs and their host galaxies .",
    "first of all , it is clear that the mass of the black hole must play a role , at all agn luminosities , because the lack of radio loud agn with small bh masses is apparent and it is not due to any trivial selection bias .",
    "second of all , it is important to note that for high bh masses both rl and rq agns exist .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , the bh mass is clearly not the only physical parameter involved in determining the level of radio loudness of each object .",
    "the so called `` spin paradigm '' @xcite has often been used to explain the rq / rl dichotomy . in brief , assuming that the jet power is related to the bh spin ( @xmath82 , @xcite ) , rl agns are explained as objects powered by rapidly spinning black holes .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a modified version of the spin paradigm , which includes two additional elements : i ) the spin of the bh in elliptical galaxies can reach higher values with respect to that of spirals , because of their different merger history ; ii ) _ only _ at high accretion rates , intermittency of jets collimation causes an agn to switch between radio - loud and radio - quiet states . according to the scenario proposed by those authors , powerful rq qsos hosted by ellipticals possess rapidly spinning black holes as the rl qsos , but they are in a state in which the jet is not collimated . in that case , the host galaxies of rl and rq qso should be indistinguishable , as well as their large - scale environment .",
    "however , there is mounting evidence that the rl qsos live in significantly richer environments than rq qsos ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we propose that the rq / rl dichotomy can be explained by a further modification of the spin paradigm , based on our finding that the mass of the black hole plays a role .",
    "investigating the physical reasons for that is beyond the aim of this paper .",
    "however , we note that the bh mass is in fact intimately related to the accretion and ejection region around the bh itself , as it sets both the radius of the innermost stable orbit and the critical eddington luminosity , as originally pointed out by @xcite .    in our conjecture ,",
    "the spin of the black hole plays a role in determining the radio loudness _",
    "only _ if the mass of the bh is @xmath80 m@xmath37 or higher . for a smaller bh mass , the spin of the bh is irrelevant , as the seyfert  1 galaxy mcg63015 and objects similar to that appear to show .",
    "mcg63015 probably represents the best case of maximally rotating black hole in agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has often been used to contradict the `` spin paradigm '' .",
    "the object is a well known radio quiet agn hosted by a e / s0 galaxy , and its estimated black hole mass is @xmath83 m@xmath37 @xcite , over 1 dex smaller than any radio loud agn .",
    "we speculate that the reason why mcg63015 is radio - quiet ultimately resides in the fact that its back hole mass is not large enough to produce a radio loud agn ( i.e. to power a powerful relativistic jet ) , even if its bh is maximally rotating .",
    "the same argument can be applied to other seyferts with similar properties , e.g. 1h  0707 - 495 @xcite , which is also associated with a bh mass of order @xmath84 m@xmath37 . in other words , the objects that are often used as `` exceptions '' to the spin - paradigm , are simply indicating that for an agn to be radio loud , not only the bh has to be spinning , but also its mass must be close to or above @xmath44 m@xmath37 .",
    "therefore , our conjecture accounts for the fact that radio quiet agns can host black holes of all masses , while rl agns can not .    at high bh masses ( above @xmath80 m@xmath37 )",
    "the spin regulates the radio loudness , as in the original version of the spin paradigm , with the rq qso having slowly rotating ( or non rotating ) black holes , and the rl qsos having rapidly rotating black holes . whether the transition occurs `` sharply '' at some particular value of the bh mass or it is instead a rather smooth transition is not clear from the data .",
    "but the lack of rl agn below @xmath80 m@xmath37 seems to indicate that the existence of a sharp `` threshold '' value for the bh mass can not be ruled out .",
    "another interesting aspect is to explore the connection between the radio loudness of the active nucleus and the structure , origin and evolution of the host galaxy . in low redshift agns",
    "there is a well established dichotomy in the properties of the radial brightness profiles or agn hosts : rl nuclei are invariably associated with `` core '' galaxies , while rq nuclei reside in `` power - law '' or spiral galaxies , which in turn have a power - law bulge @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also pointed out that radio galaxies are invariably associated with core galaxies .",
    "this is indicative of a profound link between the rq / rl dichotomy and the history of the host galaxy , as originally noted by @xcite .",
    "it has been argued ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and ref .",
    "therein ) that core galaxies most likely originate in major dry mergers .",
    "the binary black hole formed during the merger ejects stars away from the central regions , thus producing the observed stellar light deficit . on the other hand , power - law galaxies may originate in wet mergers , which triggers a starburst to create the `` extra - light '' at the center of the galaxy .",
    "somehow , the process of formation of core galaxies has to be associated with rapidly spinning black holes of high mass . @xcite",
    "have shown that mergers of two black holes of different mass may originate a spinning bh only for particular values of `` plunge inclination '' and only if the original bh is already spinning ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . otherwise , the bh is spun - down . therefore ,",
    "rapidly spinning bhs are unlikely to have suffered a recent minor merger . on the other hand , two merging black holes of similar mass may produce a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "another possible mechanism to `` spin - up '' a smbh is through accretion of matter onto the bh @xcite , although that probably only leads to moderate spin values @xcite .",
    "therefore , major _ dry _ mergers seem to perfectly fit the requirements both to `` spin - up '' the black hole , and to originate `` core '' galaxies .    on the other hand , a gas - rich ( _ wet _ )",
    "merger may provide gas to fuel a central starburst , which in turn produces the extra - light observed in power - law galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "major wet mergers are more likely to involve galaxies with relatively small bulge mass , and thus hosting small mass black holes .",
    "therefore , even if the resulting spin of the black hole may be significant ( because of either gas accretion or merger of two bhs of similar mass ) , the total bh mass is still not sufficient to power a radio - loud agn",
    ". that might be the case for s0 galaxies such as mcg63015 .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed a similar scenario .",
    "one major difference resides in the fact that these authors associate radio - loudness with counter - rotating accretion on rapidly spinning black holes resulting from major dry mergers .",
    "counter rotation is necessary to increase the efficiency of jet production .",
    "however , one possible complication is that the existence of a significant number of radio - quiet agn associated with core galaxies is expected in such a scenario ( those with co - rotating accretion ) . instead",
    ", the observations show that , at least at low redshifts , those objects are missing .",
    "summarizing , our conjecture implies that the rq / rl dichotomy is strictly linked to the history of the host galaxy , independently of the accretion rate . in order to produce a radio - loud agn",
    ", two conditions have to be satisfied : 1 ) @xmath85 ; 2 ) the spin of the bh must be significant .",
    "dry _ mergers of two galaxies , whose black holes have masses close to or above @xmath44 m@xmath37 , lead to radio - loud agns . smaller mass bhs can not produce a powerful jet , therefore the actual bh spin is unimportant ( or less important ) in those objects , as far as the radio loudness is concerned .",
    "an obvious criticism is that some stellar mass black holes are capable of producing rather powerful radio jets .",
    "although these objects can be bright in the radio , it is important to estimate their actual radio - loudness .",
    "the problem in this case is that their optical emission is generally not observed , for various reasonsmag ) completely hides the optical source . ] .",
    "however , we can estimate the radio loudness using the radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratio , as proposed by @xcite . for example , in the case of grs1915 + 105 , @xmath86 , while the typical value for radio loud agns is @xmath87 , and even the radio quiet agns have @xmath88 ( see the compilation of data in e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these objects are not `` radio - loud '' , even if they produce a rather bright radio jet .",
    "therefore , besides all of the differences that might exist between the properties of the environment in the vicinity of supermassive black holes and that of stellar mass black holes , which might as well play a role in the physical properties of the outflows , the stellar mass black holes are significantly less radio loud than all agns .",
    "this confirms our findings , i.e. small mass bh are not capable of producing true radio loud objects .",
    "differently from @xcite , and building on the results of @xcite , in our proposed scenario the properties of the host galaxy are strictly connected to the radio loudness of the nuclei , via their formation and evolution , independently of the current accretion rate level . in this way ,",
    "no `` intermittency '' and switching between rq and rl `` states '' for high accretion rate agns is needed , as it seem to contradict the result that rq and rl qsos inhabit different environments , as discussed above .",
    "therefore , in our picture , there is no difference between low and high luminosity agns , and low and high accretion rate ( or eddington ratio ) .",
    "such a scenario implies a straightforward prediction : differently from @xcite , we expect powerful radio - quiet qsos to reside in power - law galaxies , while their rl counterparts would be associated to core galaxies , exactly as observed at low redshifts . clearly , confirming such a prediction is no easy task , due to the high angular resolution needed to resolve cores in distant galaxies , especially in presence of a bright quasar nucleus .",
    "obscured qsos might be a better choice for that , under the assumptions that type  1 and type  2 agns belong to the same `` parent '' population @xcite",
    ". however , even in that case , the core radius in a z=0.5 object would be only @xmath89 mas .",
    "therefore , other structural parameters of the host galaxy that are found to correlate with the properties or the innermost structure are more likely to be observed with current instruments and in the near future ( e.g. the sersic index , * ? ? ?",
    "another implication of our proposed scenario is that broad iron lines bearing the signature of the kerr metric ( as seen in mcg63015 ) should be present in the x - rays in radio loud ( lobe - dominated ) qsos and in broad line radio galaxies .",
    "these are objects that are thought to be seen at the right orientation to allow direct view of the accretion disc , while the relativistically beamed jet emission should be observed at an angle that is large enough for that not to dominate the overall emission .",
    "therefore , the inner regions of the accretion disc should be visible , unless that region of the accretion disc is `` emptied '' because of the presence of significant outflows , or if it is in an adaf state ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "until now , no fe lines of that kind have been detected in radio - loud objects , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "but that might just be explained by the low sensitivity of current instrumentation , which does not allow a clear detection of those features in distant objects .    an obvious way of falsifying our conjecture is the observation of such relativistically broadened fe lines in the x - ray spectrum of radio - quiet qsos associated with a large black hole mass .",
    "such a result would disproof the hypothesis that a rapidly spinning black hole with a mass larger than @xmath44 m@xmath37 is sufficient to produce a radio loud agn .",
