    "the control of chaos in nonlinear systems has been an active field of research due to its potential applications in many practical situations where chaotic behaviour is not desirable . since the time of grebogi - ott - yorke @xcite",
    "several methods were proposed to control chaotic dynamics to desired periodic states or to stabilize unstable fixed points @xcite of the system .",
    "recently these techniques have been extended to control spatio - temporal chaos in spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "they are useful in many applications to control dynamics in plasma devices and chemical reactions @xcite and to reduce intensity fluctuations in laser systems @xcite .",
    "we note that control is important for emergence of regulated and sustainable phenomena in biological systems , for example to ensure stability of signal - off state in cell signaling networks which is desirable to prevent autoactivation @xcite .",
    "also in general , chaotic oscillations can degrade the performance of engineered systems and hence effective and simple control strategies have immense relevance in such cases .",
    "the dynamics of spatially extended systems can be modeled in a very simple but effective manner by using coupled map lattices ( cml ) introduced by kaneko @xcite .",
    "this approach forms an efficient method to coarse grain the local dynamics in such systems and has been used to understand complex natural phenomena .",
    "the dynamical states in such systems are extremely rich and varied , including spatiotemporal chaos , regular and irregular patterns , travelling waves , spiral waves etc.@xcite . in the case of coupled map lattices , methods for control and synchronization reported earlier",
    "are mostly based on nonlinear feedback control @xcite , constant and feedback pinning , etc . @xcite .",
    "recently coupled chaotic maps have been shown to stabilize to a homogeneous steady state due to time delay in coupling @xcite and in the presence of random delays @xcite .",
    "similarly , using multiple delay feedback , unstable steady states are shown to stabilize in chaotic electronic circuits @xcite . under threshold activated coupling at selected pinning sites , chaotic neuronal maps are reported to stabilize to regular periodic patterns @xcite . in one way coupled map lattice decentralized delayed feedback",
    "can introduce control of chaos @xcite .",
    "we note that most of the control schemes like feedback and pinning , the control units are often derived from the dynamics of the system and as such must be designed specific to each system . also delay feedback makes the system higher dimensional from the analysis point of view and requires careful choice of delay and its implementation for achieving control .",
    "however in many applications for the practical implementation of the control scheme , it is desirable to have a general scheme requiring minimum information about the system to be controlled .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a coupling scheme , which can be applied externally to the system and does not require a priori information about the system",
    ". as such it is very general and effective and can be implemented easily for control of spatio - temporal dynamics and patterns on coupled discrete systems .",
    "we note that in the context of continuous systems , one of the methods recently reported to induce amplitude death or steady state in coupled systems is coupling to an external damped system referred to as environmental coupling or indirect coupling @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully implemented using electronic circuits @xcite and applied for controlling dynamics of single systems @xcite and systems with bistability @xcite as linear augmentation .",
    "these methods in general involve a single external system to control the dynamics of coupled continuous systems .",
    "the present paper extends this particular method in two ways : the method proposed is for controlling dynamics in discrete systems and the external control system is a spatially extended system .",
    "we find that the spatial extension has its own advantages and relevance as a method for suppressing dynamics .",
    "the control system in our scheme is designed as an external lattice of damped discrete systems such that without feedback from the system , this control lattice stabilizes to a global fixed point . when system and control lattices are put in a feedback loop ,",
    "the mutual dynamics works to control their dynamics to a homogeneous steady state or periodic state .",
    "we illustrate this using logistic map and henon map as site dynamics .",
    "the analysis is developed starting with a single unit of the interacting system and the control , which is then extended to connected rings of systems , interacting 2-dimensional lattices and random networks .",
    "this ` bottom up approach ' is chosen , not only because it gives clarity in describing the mechanism but also because the cases of even single system or rings are not studied or reported so far for discrete systems .",
    "we analyze the stability of the coupled system and control lattices using the theory of circulant matrices and routh - hurwitz s criterion for discrete systems .",
    "thus we obtain regions in relevant parameter planes that correspond to effective control .",
    "we also report results from detailed numerical simulations that are found to agree with that from the stability analysis .    in particular cases ,",
    "we obtain control even when the units in the system lattice are uncoupled .",
    "so also , uncoupled units in the control lattice can control the coupled system lattice .",
    "moreover by tuning the parameters of the control lattice , we can achieve control to regular periodic patterns on the system lattice .",
    "recently , chimera states in a 1-d lattice with nonlocal couplings have been realized using liquid crystal light modulator @xcite .",
    "we show how our scheme can control the chimera states in this system .",
    "the extended and external control system introduced here can model an external medium effectively in controlling the dynamics of real world systems . as an example",
    ", we show how the dynamical patterns and undesirable excitations produced by coupled neurons can be controlled due to interaction with the extra cellular medium . in the end",
    "we extend the scheme to control the dynamics of discrete time systems on a random network . in this case",
    ", the stability of the controlled state is analyzed using master stability function method and supported by direct numerical simulations .",
    "in this section we introduce our scheme for controlling a 1-d cml of size @xmath0 by coupling with an equivalent lattice of damped systems .",
    "the dynamics at the @xmath1 node of the system lattice constructed using the discrete dynamical system , @xmath2 , with time index @xmath3 , is given by :    @xmath4    here @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 is the state vector of the discrete system , @xmath8 is the nonlinear differentiable function . also , @xmath9 represents the strength of diffusive coupling and @xmath10 is a @xmath11 matrix , entries of which decide the variables of the system to be used in the coupling .",
    "the dynamics of a damped discrete map @xmath12 in the external lattice is represented as :    @xmath13    where k is a real number with @xmath14 .",
    "thus for positive values of @xmath15 , this map is analogous to over - damped oscillator while for negative values of @xmath15 it is analogous to damped oscillator .",

    "we consider periodic boundary conditions for both the lattices .",

    "we now consider @xmath180 in @xmath181 as a parameter @xmath60 and for a range of @xmath60 , find eigenvalue with largest absolute value and use this eigenvalue as master stability function ( msf ) .",

    "control to steady state happens . ]",
    "the suppression of unwanted or undesirable excitations or chaotic oscillations in systems is essential in a variety of fields and therefore mechanisms for achieving this suppression in connected systems are of great relevance . in the specific context of neurons , it is known that exaggerated oscillatory synchronization or propagation of some excitations can lead to pathological situations and hence methods for their suppression are very important .",
    "methods to avoid oscillations by design of system controls such as power system stabilizers are important in engineering too .    in this paper we present a novel scheme where suppression of dynamics can be induced by coupling the system with an external system .",
    "our study is mostly on extended systems like rings and lattices in interaction with similar systems with different dynamics .",
    "however the method is quite general and is applicable to other such situations also where control and stabilization to steady states are desirable . even in the case of single systems , as illustrated here for henon and logistic maps , this method can be thought of as a control mechanism for targeting the system to a steady state .",
    "we develop the general stability analysis for the coupled systems using the theory of maps and circulant matrices and identify the regions where suppression is possible in the different cases considered .",
    "the results from direct numerical simulations carried out using two standard discrete systems , logistic amp and henon map , agree well with that from the stability analysis .",
    "our method will work even with a single external system as control ; however , extended or coupled external system enhances the region of effective suppression in the parameter planes .",
    "our study indicates that by tuning the parameters of the external control system , we can regulate the dynamics of the original system to desired periodic behavior with consequent spatial order .",
    "we also report how the present coupling scheme can be extended to suppress dynamics on random networks by connecting the system network with an external similar network in a feedback loop . in this context",
    "the stability analysis using master stability function , gives the critical strength of feedback coupling required for suppression .",
    "our analysis leads to the interesting result that control to steady state occurs even when the systems are not coupled among themselves but coupled individually to the connected external systems .",
    "so also , individual external systems , which are not connected among themselves but each one connected to one node in the system , can suppress the dynamics of the connected nodes in the system .",
    "this facilitates flexibility in the design of control through connected or isolated external systems depending on the requirement .",
    "the scheme of external and extended control , introduced here , has relevance in understanding and modeling controlled dynamics in real systems due to interaction with external medium .",
    "we illustrate this in the context of coupled neurons where the suppression of dynamical patterns is achieved by coupling with the extra cellular medium .",
    "we also indicate how the same scheme can be applied to control chimera states in non - locally coupled systems . until recently ,",
    "cml was considered as an idealized theoretical model for studies related to spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "however the recent works on a physically realizable cml system using liquid - crystal spatial light modulator @xcite and based on digital phaselocked loop @xcite have opened up many interesting possibilities in studying their control schemes also experimentally . in this context",
    "we note that the scheme presented in the paper is suitable for a physical realization using optical instruments or electronic hardware .",
