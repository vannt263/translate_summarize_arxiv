    "epidemic dynamics , one of the attracting problems in both biological and physical communities , aims at explaining the dynamical processes of disease spreading , computer virus prevailing , and so on .",
    "the previous investigations based on the differential equations are always under the assumption of both homogeneous infectivity and homogeneous connectivity of each individual @xcite .",
    "therefore , if denote the possible contacts , along which the infection spreads , by edges , then the previous studies mainly concentrated on the epidemic dynamics on complete or random networks .",
    "however , against the above assumption , the empirical data of real networks indicate the universal existence of heterogeneous topologies @xcite .",
    "one intriguing finding is that many real networks have approximately power - law degree distributions , that is to say , the probability distribution function of degree , @xmath0 , approximately obeys the form @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "this kind of distribution implies an unexpected abundance of vertices with very large degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ , the so - called  hubs \" or  super - spreaders \" .",
    "this series of networks , named scale - free ( sf ) networks , attract many researchers to investigate the corresponding epidemic behaviors ( see the review paper @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the most exemplary models in this field , having been extensively lucubrated , are the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) models .",
    "the recent works about sis @xcite and sir @xcite models on sf networks present us with completely new epidemic propagation scenarios that a highly heterogeneous structure will lead to the absence of any epidemic threshold .",
    "however , many real epidemic processes can not be properly described by the above two models . in this paper ,",
    "we especially focus on the onset dynamics of epidemic outbreaks , whose behavior is governed by the pure prevalence without the natural recovery or removing .",
    "that is to say , a speeding time - scale is much smaller than the recovery time - scale . in the real world , when the speed of the disease is so drastic that the effect of recovery and death can be ignored , it is the identical process with above one .",
    "in addition , in some broadcasting processes , each node is in the possession of two discrete state : received or unreceived .",
    "different from the sis or sir model , the ones having received signals will not alter back to the state unreceived .",
    "hence , it is more proper to utilize the so - called susceptible - infected ( si ) model to describe those dynamic processes , in which the infected nodes stay infected and spread the infection to the susceptible neighbors with rate @xmath3 .",
    "very recently , barthlemy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the si model in barabsi - albert ( ba ) networks @xcite , and found that this epidemic process has an infinite spreading velocity in the limit of infinite population . following a similar process on _ random apollonian networks _ and weighted scale - free networks , zhou _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the effects of clustering @xcite and weight distribution @xcite on si epidemics . by using the theory of branching processes",
    ", vzquez obtained a more accurate solution about the time behavior of si model @xcite .",
    "the si model with identical infectivity , which leads to a slower spreading in sf networks than the standard model , has recently been investigated by zhou _",
    "_ @xcite . and the geographical effect on si model is studied by xu _",
    "although these previous works are very helpful to the deeply understanding of si epidemic , compared with the extensively studied sir and sis models , the si model has not been carefully investigated thus far .",
    "especially , the immunization effect on si dynamics , which is very important for controlling the prevalence , has not yet been investigated . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the immunization effect of si model on sf networks , which can be considered as a complementary work of the previous studies on the immunization of sir and sis models .",
    "in the standard network si model , each individual is represented by a node of the network and the edges are the connections between individuals along which the infection may spread .",
    "each individual can be in two discrete states , either susceptible or infected .",
    "the infection transmission is defined by the spreading rate @xmath3 at which each susceptible individual acquires the infection from an infected neighbor during one time step .    using the mean - field theory",
    ", the reaction rate equations can be written as @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the density of infected individuals with degree @xmath6 , @xmath7 the average degree , and @xmath8 the density of the infected neighbors of a @xmath6-degree node . neglecting terms of order @xmath9 , the evolution behavior , @xmath10 ,",
    "can be approximately solved as @xcite : @xmath11 in an sf networks with a degree distribution exponent @xmath12 , the second - order moment @xmath13 will approach to infinite as the increase of network size @xmath14 , indicating an infinite velocity in the onset of epidemic spreading .",
