    "the effect of quenched disorder typified by impurities , lattice imperfections , and vacancies on condensed matter systems has been a source of intense scientific investigation in the recent past .",
    "in fact , the study of such  frozen - in \" disorder has led to the unravelling of a host of very interesting phenomena like infinite randomness fixed points  @xcite , quantum griffiths effects  @xcite , and maybe even smearing of phase transition  @xcite .",
    "even though as highlighted above multi - impurity effects can be extremely interesting , the study of a single impurity embedded in a host can also act as an efficient probe of the physical characteristics of the underlying bulk material , a situation exemplified by the case of local impurity acting as a probe of the order - paramater symmetry in unconventional superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this manuscript for the most part belongs to the latter genre wherein we study the role played by a single impurity in identifying the quantum phase transition inherent in the kitaev model .",
    "the kitaev model has become one of the paradigmatic models that has been studied in various contexts ranging from strong correlation physics to topological quantum computation .",
    "its theoretical appeal lies in the fact that it represents one of the few spin systems that can be solved exactly .",
    "the solution to the clean kitaev model is effected by recasting the spin hamiltonian into that of an equivalent majorana hopping problem in the background of static @xmath0 gauge configurations .",
    "the exact solution of the model reveals both a gapless and gapped spin - liquid phases with a zero - temperature quantum transition interpolating between these two phases .",
    "the gapless spin liquid phase is quite unique as it supports a spin - spin correlation function that is short ranged @xcite , thus setting it apart from other spin - liquid phases studied so far .",
    "it also supports fractionally charged topological excitations both abelian and non - abelian that can be plausibly used to perform quantum computations .",
    "apart from its utility for topological quantum computation or for its usefulness in studying spin - liquid ground states , the spin-1/2 kitaev model defined on a two dimensional hexagonal lattice has become a powerful test - bed example to study various fundamental concepts in the field of strong correlation physics .",
    "for instance , it has been used to study fractionally charged excitations that occur in topological insulators thereby providing a beautiful higher dimensional extension @xcite of the jackiw - rebbi theory @xcite , @xcite , that describes charge fractionalization in one dimensional system .",
    "it has also been utilized to study dynamics of quantum quenches across the critical region @xcite .",
    "moreover , there now exists higher dimensional realizations of the kitaev model @xcite , and also extension to higher values of spin @xcite    as is clear from the preceding paragraph the clean kitaev model has been the subject of intense scientific investigations in the last few years .",
    "however , apart from a few notable exceptions , ( detailed in the next paragraph ) , one area that has been rather neglected is the study of the effect of impurities on the kitaev model .",
    "this is a particularly glaring deficiency as now there exists proposals for experimental realizations of the kitaev model @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of impurity effects gain an added significance as realistic systems are seldom clean .",
    "now , the simplest form of quenched disorder involves studying the effect of a single impurity on the bulk system .",
    "such a study was undertaken by @xcite for the case of a single magnetic impurity that was embedded in the host kitaev model .",
    "it was shown that coupling of an impurity to the host kitaev system leads to an unusual kondo effect that is sensitive to the topological transition in the kitaev model . in a related work ,",
    "willans et .",
    "al @xcite showed that disorder in the form of a single vacancy binds a flux which in turn gives rise to a local moment .",
    "furthermore they showed that this moment leads to a vacancy susceptibility that diverges logarithmically as a function of the applied field , ( for weak applied fields ) .",
    "while it is true that impact of quenched disorder has received very scant attention , the effect of impurities on allied models have been rather well studied . more specifically : the kitaev model maps onto a fermionic model displaying bi - partite hopping on a hexagonal lattice in the background of @xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "now , the impact of quenched disorder on similar bi - partite hopping models have been studied in the context of anderson localization . in a seminal work ,",
    "( see @xcite @xcite ) , it was shown that the quenched impurities lead to a divergent density of states , ( dos ) in models that display bi - partite hopping . more specifically , by using a field theoretical formulation",
    ", these authors showed that a random - mass form of disorder , ( in addition to a random vector potential ) would lead to a highly divergent dos that conforms to the functional form , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "this faster than power - law divergence of the dos should be contrasted with the results of ludwig et .",
    "al @xcite wherein they studied a random vector potential model with bi - partite hopping .",
    "these authors showed that the dos in these models diverge as a power - law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a continuously varying dynamical exponent .",
    "now , the field theoretical treatment of gade and wegner suffered from a slight draw - back : it did not provide a physical frame - work wherein the diverging dos at the band center could be understood .",
    "this situation was remedied in the work of motrunich et .",
    "al @xcite wherein an intuitive and physically appealing argument was provided for the origin of the diverging dos and the low - lying states that was causing it .",
    "they further argued that the dos indeed does diverge with a functional form analogous to that derived by gade and wegner , however , with the exponent @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 obtained in @xcite .",
    "another extremely relevant physical context wherein such disordered bi - partite hopping models holds relevance is provided by the case of graphene . in graphene , due to open surfaces and substrates , disorder is an ever present bug - bear .",
    "one form of disorder that has been relatively well studied in the context of graphene is vacancy disorder .",
    "this type of disorder arise naturally in the case of irradiated graphene wherein the carbon atoms are knocked out of graphene planes .",
    "the impact of such vacancies on the electronic properties of graphene were investigated in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the influence of various other forms of disorder , ( also inclusive of the case of vacancy disorder ) on the electronic properties of graphene was studied in @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study the influence of vacancy disorder in the kitaev model . more specifically ,",
    "we focus our attention mainly on the structure of the wavefunction at the site of a vacancy disorder .",
    "we show that vacancy disorder gives rise to a  zero - mode \" that is localized at the impurity site .",
    "as we shall see later on in this paper , this zero - mode exists in both the gapped and gapless phases of this model and is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry of the bi - partite hopping problem .",
    "however , as will be shown in the bulk of this mansuscript , the functional form of the zero - mode is quite different in two phases thereby providing an invaluable tool for distinguishing different phases of this model",
    ". the interesting question of impact of many vacancies on the kitaev model will be addressed in a future publication @xcite .",

    "[ model ] we recapitulate the mapping of the kitaev model into a non - interacting majorana fermion problem by following the jordan - wigner fermionization scheme . sec .",
    "[ single vacancy ] is devoted to the analytic derivation of the zero - mode wave function that is localized at the vacancy site .",

    "it also serves to set the notations for the rest of this paper .",
    "the model comprises of spins residing on the sites of a honeycomb lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ figlattice ] .",
    "the spins interact with each other via nearest neighbour coupling which is dependent on the bond orientation .",
    "these orientations are labeled as as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 in the figure , fig .",

    "they are connected to each other via the @xmath10-link .",
    "a point in the lattice is thus labeled by a triplet of numbers @xmath11 where @xmath12 denote the unit cell and @xmath13 correspond to the a(b ) sublattice .",

    "[ intro ] , this spin - model can be mapped onto a majorana fermion hopping problem .",
    "different methods can be adopted to effect this transformation . in this manuscript",
    "we shall employ the jordan - wigner fermionization scheme as employed by feng et .",
    ", @xcite in this context .",
    "define the jordan - wigner tail operator as @xmath16 where @xmath17 if @xmath18 or @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "now the majorana fermion operators can be defined as : @xmath21 in terms of these operators the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the operators @xmath23 , defined on the @xmath4-links , is hermitian and commutes among themselves and with the hamiltonian reflecting the local symmetry of the kitaev model .",
    "it can be shown that the operators @xmath24 have eigenvalues @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian gets block diagonalised into different sectors corresponding to different sets of eigenvalues of @xmath24 . in each of these sectors",
    ", the hamiltonian becomes a quadratic fermionic system obtained by replacing each @xmath24 by its eigenvalue and can be re - cast into the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "thus , as alluded to in the introduction the kitaev model has been mapped onto a non - interacting majorana fermion problem in the background of static @xmath0 gauge field .    if there are @xmath29 number of unit cells , we have @xmath30 spins and the hilbert space is @xmath31 dimensional . since there are @xmath29 @xmath4-links , there are @xmath32 sectors each of which has dimension @xmath32 corresponding to @xmath30 majorana fermions .    for further calculations ,",
    "let us first see how the eigenvectors / values of the coefficient matrix @xmath33 are related to the fermionic excitation modes of the system . since @xmath28 is antisymmetric , the eigenvalues of @xmath33 comes in pairs @xmath34 with eigenvectors @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath36 .",
    "we can choose the eigenvectors to be orthonormal since @xmath33 is hermitian .",
    "define fermion operators @xmath37 .",
    "it is easily seen that these operators obey @xmath38 .",
    "we get , @xmath39    it is known that the ground state of the hamiltonian lies in a sector wherein all the @xmath24 operators take the eigenvalue @xmath40  @xcite . by making use of the translational symmetry in the problem , a solution of the model can be effected by going into fourier transformed representation .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian re - expressed in terms of the fourier transformed variables , @xmath41 @xmath42 , ( where @xmath43 ) reads , @xmath44 here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath47 and the fermionic excitations are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the excitation spectrum is gapless if there exist points where @xmath50 which is possible only if following condition is satisfied : @xmath51 the gapless phase is characterised by fermi points where the @xmath52 vanishes .",
    "there is a quantum phase transition from the gapless- to the gapped - phase as the parameters cross the conditions in eq .",
    "[ gapcondition ] .",
    "this quantum phase transition is the one that we wish to probe via a single vacancy disorder .",
    "in this section , we study the nature of the wave - function at the site of a single vacancy . the analytic functional form is derived for both the gapped and gapless phases .    for the sake of concreteness",
    "consider the kitaev model with a vacancy at the b - site in the unit - cell @xmath53 , ( see fig .",
    "[ figlattice ] ) .",
    "note that the jordan - wigner construction goes through with the tail operator @xmath54 missing @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "as the system is no longer translationally invariant one can not use fourier transform to solve the problem .",
    "however , the general structure of the hamiltonian , eq .  [ hamiltonianstructure ] , remains with @xmath28 now being a @xmath57 matrix obtained by removing the row and column corresponding to the site @xmath58 from the matrix @xmath28 in eq .",
    "[ hamiltonianstructure ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath59 eigenvectors forming pairs as described in sec .  [ model ] and one unpaired eigenvector denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "this eigenvector should be real with zero eigenvalue because of the @xmath61 symmetry briefly alluded to in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the @xmath59 pairs can be combined to form @xmath59 complex fermion operators @xmath62 leaving behind a single unpaired mode .",
    "this unpaired eigenvector forms a majorana mode , @xmath63 as @xmath64 and @xmath65 . note that by removing a spin at @xmath58 , we have left out one other majorana fermion operator from the hamiltonian ; @xmath66 which would have formed the operator @xmath67 with @xmath68 had the spin been present .",
    "thus a complex fermion mode can be constructed from these two majoran modes as @xmath69 which will be a zero - energy excitation of the hamiltonian which , again , has the same form as eq .",
    "[ hamiltoniangeneral ] .",
    "however , since @xmath70 is not present in the hamiltonian , the number of @xmath24 operators is now @xmath59 .",
    "thus , now there are @xmath71 sectors each with @xmath29 complex fermions .",
    "hence as expected the total dimension of the system is @xmath72 .",
    "now that the above discussion has clearly established that a single vacancy induces a zero - energy fermionic excitation mode in the kitaev model , let us turn our attention to the analytic structure of these modes .",
    "to do so , we employ a method developed by pereira et .",
    "al @xcite , @xcite in the context of zero modes arising out of a vacancy defect in graphene . this adaptability of the technique developed for the case of graphene to the kitaev model is not so surprising as they both give rise to similar fermion hopping problems . unlike the case of graphene studies by pereira et .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , where one is restricted to the isotropic case @xmath73 , here we consider the general anisotropic hopping problem and obtain expressions for the zero mode for the parameter regimes corresponding to both gapped- and gapless - phases of the clean model .",
    "more specifically , we obtain an asymptotic form for the defect wave - function in the gapless phase , whereas one can evaluate an exact form of the wave function in the gapped phase .    before obtaining explicit expression for",
    "the zero modes of @xmath33 with b - site vacancy , let us first see how they are related to the corresponding zero mode when the vacancy site is in the a - sublattice .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the clean model has the symmetry given by @xmath76 for any @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the pauli matrix . but",
    "the vacancy breaks the translational invariance .",
    "let @xmath79 be the matrix to be added to @xmath28 to create the vacancy , by removing corresponding matrix elements from @xmath28 , at position @xmath80 in the sublattice @xmath81 .",
    "now , @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 is an eigenvector of @xmath84 with eigenvalue @xmath85 , then it follows that @xmath86 is an eigenvector of @xmath87 with eigenvalue @xmath88 .",
    "thus we need to find the localised zero mode with one type of vacancy only , the other obtained from the relation given above . in the discussion hereafter , @xmath89 always denote the zero mode created by @xmath81-sublattice vacancy at site @xmath77 .",
    "consider a b - site vacancy in the unit cell @xmath53 as shown in the fig .",

    "now , it is also known that for instance if @xmath180 , then the zero modes have non - zero support only on the a - sublattice .",
    "the situation is reversed if @xmath181 .",
    "thus , according to the above discussion if the vacancy pair is introduced on different sublattices then one would assume that the zero - modes interact with each other lifting away from zero .",
    "while this is indeed true in the gapless case the gapped case comes with an additional wrinkle . in other words , in an infinite lattice with open boundary condition , depending on the position of vacancies , there may still be intact zero modes even when the two impurities are placed on different sub - lattices . to see this",
    "let us define @xmath182 .",
    "then @xmath183 \\left(\\begin{array}{c }                                         0\\\\1                                        \\end{array } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have written @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "comparison with the previous section gives @xmath186 .",
    "for the gapped phase , @xmath187 is zero unless @xmath188 is within the cone where the zero mode is nonzero .",
    "thus , @xmath189 is also a zero mode when @xmath188 is outside this cone .",
    "note that the fact that the lattice is infinite in the @xmath123 direction is crucial for this argument .",
    "for periodic boundary condition , the cone could wrap around the torus and the position @xmath188 will be within the cone . for other cases including the gapless phase , @xmath187 is nonzero in general and we could represent the effective coefficient matrix in the space spanned by the two zero modes @xmath190 as @xmath191 where @xmath192 @xmath193 $ ] .",
    "here we have also used the relation @xmath194 which follows from @xmath195 and the relation between @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the quantity within the square brackets is exactly what is excluded from being zero in eq .",
    "[ eigenvalueequation ] .",
    "@xmath198 is real since the zero modes are real .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath199 are @xmath200 and the two zero modes lift off from zero eigenvalue and a crude estimate of the new eigenvalues of @xmath201 is given by @xmath202 that decays with the distance between the two impurities : @xmath198 decays as powerlaw , asymptotically , with @xmath203 in the gapless phase and exponentially when the a - site impurity is inside the cone defining zero - mode eigenvector for b - site impurity .",
    "the role played by vacancies in identifying the gapped and gapless phases has been discussed .",
    "in particular it has been shown that a single vacancy in the gapless phase leads to a  quasi - localized \" zero - mode that asymptotically decays as a power - law . in the gapped phase ,",
    "the zero - mode due to the vacancy defect is exponentially localized with - in a cone that emanates from the vacancy .",
    "these results were obtained analytically by laying recourse to a technique developed in the context of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that a single vacancy impurity can act as a probe in distinguishing the two - phases of the kitaev model .",
    "these two phases are characterized by very different behaviors of the ipr as well , and while the transition is characterized by a local minimum of this quantity , it shows for finite lattices , intriguing patterns as a function of the parameters in the gapless phase . the localization in the gapped phase leads to summable wavefunctions and to a finite total site - site entanglement as measured by the concurrence .",
    "this diverges as the gapless phase is approached in a manner that is very easy to calculate .",
    "we have also briefly discussed the effect of interacting zero modes . more specifically , specializing to the case of two vacancy defects , we have seen that the number of zero - modes in the gapless phase is equal to the difference of vacancies in the @xmath28 and @xmath204 sub - lattice , in conformity with the  index \"- theorem in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we have also argued that there are situations in the gapped phase of the kitaev model , ( in the infinite lattice limit with open boundary conditions ) , wherein the above mentioned  index \"-",
    "theorem does not hold .",
    "now , we turn our attention to some open problems that still remain to be addressed with regards to the effect of vacancy disorder on the kitaev model .",
    "as is obvious from this paper , a proper discussion of multi - vacancy effect in the kitaev model is sorely lacking . as a prelude to any such effort one needs to generalize the zero - mode counting argument of pereira et .",
    "al . so as to account for the extreme directionality dependence of the zero - mode wave function in the gapped phase . in the limit of multiple impurities",
    "it is plausible that one can reduce the problem to a system that is governed by an effective free - fermion action with both random mass - term and random @xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "it is an open question whether this is indeed the case .",
    "if one could write down such an effective hamiltonian , in the spirit of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , one could analytically investigate the effect of impurities in determining thermodynamic properties like the dos .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether these models show griffiths type behavior exemplified by a divergent dos wherein the divergence is controlled by continuously varying exponents that are a function of the disorder concentration , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite where a similar effect was shown to exist in the @xmath205 random bond ising model ) .",
    "results that come from such effective action description of disorder effects can also serve to shed light on the effect of disorder on spin - liquids in general    some of these issues addressed above could be also studied numerically .",
    "more specifically , the functional form of the dos as a function of the disorder concentration and other system parameters are being studied by numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "as this paper was being written up , we were made aware of a pre - print @xcite wherein results similar to ours in the context of kitaev model were obtained .",
