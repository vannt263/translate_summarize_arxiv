    "the study of the heuristic chern - simons path integral functional in @xcite inspired the following two general approaches to quantum topology :    * the perturbative approach based on the chern - simons path integral in the landau gauge ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . * the non - perturbative `` quantum group approach '' that comes in two different versions : the `` surgery '' version ( cf . @xcite and the first part of @xcite ) and the `` state sum '' or `` shadow '' version ( cf . @xcite and the second part of @xcite ) .    while for the first approach the relationship to the chern - simons path integral is obvious it is not fully understood yet how the expressions that appear in the second approach are related to the chern - simons path integral . in other words",
    "the following problem has so far remained open ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) :    1 .   derive the algebraic expressions ( in particular , the @xmath2-matrices resp .",
    "the quantum 6j - symbols ) that appear in approach ( a2 ) directly from the chern - simons path integral .",
    "approach ( a2 ) is considerably less complicated than approach ( a1 ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that if one can solve problem ( p1 ) then the corresponding path integral derivation will be less complicated than the path integral derivation given in @xcite .",
    "one could therefore hope that after having solved problem ( p1 ) one can make progress towards the solution of the following problem , which can be considered to be one of the major open problems in quantum topology ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    1 .   make rigorous sense of the heuristic path integral expressions for the wilson loop observables ( wlos ) that were studied in @xcite ( cf .",
    "formula below ) .",
    "as a first step towards the solution of problem ( p2 ) one can try to solve the following weakened version :    1 .   make rigorous sense either of the original path integral expressions for the wilson loop observables or , alternatively , of those path integral expressions that arise from the original ones after one has fixed a suitable gauge .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give a partial solution of problems ( p1 ) and ( p2). in order to do so we will concentrate on the special situation where the base manifold @xmath0 of the chern - simons model is of the form @xmath3 and then apply the so - called `` torus gauge fixing '' procedure which was successfully used in @xcite for the computation of the partition function of chern - simons models on such manifolds ( cf .",
    "( 7.1 ) in @xcite ) and for the computation of the wilson loop observables of a special type of links in @xmath0 , namely links @xmath4 that consist of `` vertical '' loops ( cf .",

    "[ subsec7.2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , due to the remarkable property of eq . that all the heuristic measures that appear there are of `` gaussian type '' we can apply similar techniques as in the axial gauge approach to chern - simons models on @xmath5 developed in @xcite . in particular , we can make use of white noise analysis and of the two regularization techniques `` loop smearing '' and `` framing '' .",
    "finally , we study the question if and how the right - hand side of eq . can be evaluated explicitly and if , by doing this , one arrives at the same algebraic expressions for the corresponding quantum invariants as in the shadow version of approach ( a2 ) .",

    "[ subsec3.4 ] we finally arrive in subsec .",
    "[ subsec3.5 ] at the aforementioned heuristic path integral formula for the wlos .",
    "the rest of the paper is concerned with the question how one can make rigorous sense of ( the inner integral in ) the heuristic formula and how one can evaluate its right - hand side explicitly .",

    "[ sec4 ] ( step 1 ) we briefly summarize the rigorous realization of the integral functional @xmath8 found in @xcite and we then show in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] how the whole inner integral can be realized rigorously and evaluated explicitly ( step 2 ) . in sec .",

    "( after all `` torus gauge fixing '' and `` axial gauge fixing '' share the aspect of being `` singular '' gauges ) .",
    "on the other hand it is clear that the `` singularity '' of axial gauge fixing alone can not be `` the cause '' for the lsd problem . clearly , axial gauge fixing is equally singular if the structure group @xmath9 of the model is abelian but as we saw in @xcite some of the additional algebraic relations that hold in the abelian case prevent the lsd problem from appearing .",
    "instead we prefer to interpret the lsd problem as a reflection of the idea that something is `` wrong '' with chern - simons models on non - compact manifolds .",
    "for example , the non - compactness of the manifold @xmath5 has the unpleasant effect that the expression @xmath1015 is not defined for every @xmath38 .",
    "following @xcite we therefore assumed in @xcite in several computations that the 1-form @xmath45 had compact support ( or , alternatively , was of rapid decrease ) .",
    "if one could make this assumption consistently then things might not be so bad .",
    "one could then try to replace the space @xmath21 of all gauge fields on @xmath5 appearing in the relevant path integral expressions of the form @xmath1016 by the space @xmath1017 of 1-forms on @xmath5 with compact support and hope that the new path integrals reproduce the interesting knot invariants that appeared in @xcite for chern - simons models on compact manifolds .",
    "however , if one wants to apply axial gauge fixing there is ( at least ) one argument that makes it necessary to work with the original space @xmath21 of all gauge fields , cf . the argument in subsec .",

    ". it should therefore not be too surprising that the axial gauge approach for chern - simons models on @xmath5 runs into difficulties ( at least when using the implementation of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the loop smearing dependence was not the only complication / problem in @xcite .",
    "there were two other problems : firstly , it turned out in @xcite that the values of the wlos differ from those expected in the standard literature even for the few links for which there was no loop smearing dependence , i.e. for loops without double points .",
    "secondly , in the approach in @xcite it was unclear right from the beginning how quantum groups ( resp . the corresponding r - matrices ) could enter the computations .",
    "note that a quantum group @xmath1021 , @xmath1022 , is obtained from the classical enveloping algebra @xmath1023 by a deformation process that involves a fixed cartan subalgebra @xmath62 .",
    "but such a cartan subalgebra never played any role in @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the torus gauge approach to chern - simons models on @xmath6 a cartan subalgebra @xmath62 plays an important role right from the beginning .",
    "moreover , as we have seen in subsec .",
    "[ subsec6.3 ] above , in the torus gauge approach to chern - simons models on @xmath241 with _ compact _ , for which the set @xmath194 $ ] consists of only one element and the summation @xmath930 } \\cdots$ ] is therefore trivial , one runs into difficulties .",
    "in particular , the values of the wlos of links without double points are then _ not _ given by the shadow invariant , which is an other argument in favor of our claim that something is `` wrong '' with chern - simons models on non - compact manifolds ] @xmath90 the values of the wlos of links without double points do agree with those expressions expected in the standard literature .",
    "( in @xcite it is shown that this is also true for general groups @xmath9 and general link colorings , cf .",
    "point ( 1 ) in subsec .",
    "[ subsec7.2 ] below ) .",
    "this makes us optimistic that also the last complication , i.e. the lsd problem will not appear in the torus gauge approach .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that even if it turns out that the lsd problem does appear during the evaluation of the wlos of general links , the torus gauge approach is still useful :    * by studying the wlos of links consisting exclusively of three vertical loops in the torus gauge approach one obtains a path integral derivation of the verlinde formula resp .",

    "but there are other directions for a generalization / extension of the results of the present paper which we also find interesting .",
    "they are given in the following list :    * generalize the results of subsec .",
    "[ subsec6.3 ] and the results that can be expected if the project described in subsec .",
    "[ subsec7.1 ] can be completed successfully to arbitrary ( simple simply - connected compact ) groups @xmath9 and arbitrary link colorings .",
    "( recall that in subsec .",
    "[ subsec6.3 ] we only considered the special situation where @xmath10 and where all the loops are `` colored '' with the fundamental representation @xmath959 ) .",
    "in fact , for the case of links without double points this generalization has already been carried out in @xcite . as a by - product of the computations in @xcite we obtained a `` path integral derivation '' of the so - called quantum racah formula , cf .",
    "@xcite . * in a recent paper , cf .",
    "@xcite , blau and thompson study the partition function of chern - simons models on 3-manifolds @xmath0 which are the total spaces of arbitrary @xmath36-bundles ( and not only trivial @xmath36-bundles as in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , one can ask whether the results of the present paper can be generalized to chern - simons models on arbitrary @xmath36-bundles .",

    "[ subsec7.1 ] above .",
    "* it should be possible to obtain a rigorous realization of the full integral expression on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "using results / techniques from white noise analysis , cf .",
    "however , since this treatment based on white noise analysis is rather technical it is natural to look for alternative approaches for making rigorous sense of the right - hand side of eq . .",
    "for example , one can study approaches which involve a suitable discretization of the base manifold @xmath3 .",
    "for every fixed triangulation @xmath1025 of @xmath90 and every fixed triangulation of @xmath36 there is a discrete analogue of the torus gauge fixing procedure and it should be possible to `` discretize '' the computations in secs .",
    "[ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] of the present paper in such a way that the shadow invariant is recovered within this discretized setting ( possibly after taking a suitable continuum limit ) .",
    "such an approach is currently studied in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in order to carry out the aforementioned `` discretization '' successfully , it will probably be necessary to use ideas and constructions from @xcite like `` field doubling '' of @xmath1025 ] and the discrete hodge star operator introduced in sec . 2 in @xcite ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in the present paper we have shown how the face models that were introduced in @xcite for the definition of the shadow invariant arise naturally when evaluating the right - hand side of eq . , which generalizes formula ( 7.1 ) in @xcite .",
    "although we have carried out all the details only in some special cases we think that it is reasonable to expect ( cf . the arguments in subsec .",
    "[ subsec7.1 ] above ) that when completing the computations for general links one will finally arrive at the formula in appendix b ( or , for @xmath1027 , at the relevant generalization of formula described in @xcite ) .",
    "if this turns out to be true then this would mean that we have solved problem ( p1 ) of the introduction for manifolds @xmath0 of the form @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in view of point ( 4 ) in subsec .",
    "[ subsec7.2 ] this would probably also lead to the solution of problem ( p2) for such manifolds .",
    "first we observe that for all @xmath1028 and @xmath491 such that @xmath1029 holds , the functions @xmath1030 and @xmath1031 on @xmath461 are independent w.r.t .",
    "this follows from the @xmath483-analogues of eqs . and ( with the help of the polarization identity ) .",
    "using the general wick theorem analogue mentioned in sec .",

    "thus , for small @xmath491 , @xmath1037 , @xmath1038 , and arbitrary polynomial functions @xmath1039 in @xmath1040 variables we have : the @xmath1041-tuple @xmath1042 given by @xmath1043 is independent w.r.t . @xmath483",
    "if @xmath229 is sufficiently small ( that the aforementioned support condition is fulfilled for @xmath1042 and small @xmath513 follows from the assumptions that @xmath659 and that the framing @xmath484 is horizontal ) .",
