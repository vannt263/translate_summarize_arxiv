    "the notion of magnetic charge has intrigued physicists since dirac @xcite showed that it was consistent with quantum mechanics provided a suitable quantization condition was satisfied : for a monopole of magnetic charge @xmath0 in the presence of an electric charge @xmath1 , that quantization condition is ( in this paper we use rationalized units ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an integer . for a pair of dyons , that is , particles carrying both electric and magnetic charge ,",
    "the quantization condition is replaced by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the charges of the two dyons . ) below . ]    with the advent of `` more unified '' non - abelian theories , classical composite monopole solutions were discovered @xcite .",
    "the mass of these monopoles would be of the order of the relevant gauge - symmetry breaking scale , which for grand unified theories is of order @xmath7 gev or higher .",
    "but there are models where the electroweak symmetry breaking can give rise to monopoles of mass @xmath8 tev @xcite .",
    "even the latter are not yet accessible to accelerator experiments , so limits on heavy monopoles depend either on cosmological considerations @xcite , or detection of cosmologically produced ( relic ) monopoles impinging upon the earth or moon @xcite .",
    "however , _ a priori _ , there is no reason that dirac / schwinger monopoles or dyons of arbitrary mass might not exist : in this respect , it is important to set limits below the 1 tev scale .    such an experiment is currently in progress at the university of oklahoma @xcite , where we expect to be able to set limits on _ direct _ monopole production at fermilab up to several hundred gev .",
    "this will be a substantial improvement over previous limits @xcite .",
    "but _ indirect _ searches have been proposed and carried out as well .",
    "de rjula @xcite proposed looking at the three - photon decay of the @xmath9 boson , where the process proceeds through a virtual monopole loop .",
    "if we use his formula @xcite for the branching ratio for the @xmath10 process , compared to the current experimental upper limit @xcite for the branching ratio of @xmath11 , we can rule out monopole masses lower than about 400 gev , rather than the 600 gev quoted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "similarly , ginzburg and panfil @xcite and more recently ginzburg and schiller @xcite considered the production of two photons with high transverse momenta by the collision of two photons produced either from @xmath12 or quark-(anti-)quark collisions . again the final photons are produced through a virtual monopole loop .",
    "based on this theoretical scheme , an experimental limit has appeared by the d0 collaboration @xcite , which sets the following bounds on the monopole mass @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spin of the monopole .",
    "it is worth noting that a mass limit of 120 gev for a dirac monopole has been set by graf , schfer , and greiner @xcite , based on the monopole contribution to the vacuum polarization correction to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "( actually , we believe that the correct limit , obtained from the well - known textbook formula @xcite for the @xmath0-factor correction due to a massive dirac particle is 60 gev . )",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to , first , describe the key theoretical elements necessary for the establishment of a direct limit for production of monopoles at fermilab : an estimate of the production cross section for monopole - antimonopole pairs at the collider must be made , and then an estimate of the binding probability of such produced monopoles with matter must be given , so that we can predict how many monopoles would be bound to the detector elements that are run through our induction detector .",
    "such estimates were given in our proposal to fermilab ; the complete analysis will be given in the experimental papers to follow . here",
    "the emphasis will be on the elementary processes involved .",
    "a secondary purpose of this paper is to critique the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and thereby demonstrate that experimental limits , such as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on virtual processes are unreliable .",
    "we will show that the theory is based on a naive application of electromagnetic duality ; the resulting cross section can not be valid because unitarity is violated for monopole masses as low as the quoted limits , and the process is subject to enormous , uncontrollable radiative corrections .",
    "it is not correct , in any sense , as refs . @xcite and @xcite state ,",
    "that the effective expansion parameter is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is some external photon energy ; rather , the factors of @xmath18 emerge kinematically from the requirements of gauge invariance at the one - loop level .",
    "if , in fact , a correct calculation introduced such additional factors of @xmath18 , arising from the complicated coupling of magnetic charge to photons , we argue that no limit could be deduced for monopole masses from the current experiments .",
    "it may even be the case , based on preliminary field - theoretic calculations , that processes involving the production of real photons vanish .",
    "it is envisaged that if monopoles are sufficiently light , they would be produced by a drell - yan type of process occurring in @xmath19 collisions at the tevatron .",
    "the difficulty is to make a believable estimate of the elementary process @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for quark and @xmath13 for magnetic monopole .",
    "it is not known how to calculate such a process using perturbation theory ; indeed , perturbation theory is inapplicable to monopole processes because of the quantization condition ( [ quant ] ) .",
    "it is only because of that consistency condition that the dirac string , for example , disappears from the result .",
    "only formally has it been shown that the quantum field theory of electric and magnetic charges is independent of the string orientation , or , more generally , is gauge and rotationally invariant @xcite .",
    "it has not yet proved possible to develop generally consistent schemes for calculating processes involving real or virtual magnetically charged particles .",
    "partly this is because a sufficiently general field theoretic formulation has not yet been given ; this defect will be addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "however , the nonrelativistic scattering of magnetically charged particles is well understood @xcite . thus it should not be surprising that an eikonal approximation gives a string - independent result for electron - monopole scattering provided the condition ( [ quant ] ) is satisfied .",
    "more than two decades ago schwinger proposed @xcite and urrutia carried out such a calculation @xcite .",
    "indeed , this subject has had arrested development .",
    "since this is the only successful field - theoretic calculation yet presented , it may be useful to review it here .",

    ", the energy loss in matter of a magnetically charge particle is approximately obtained from that of a particle with charge @xmath58 by the substitution @xcite @xmath196 and the classical nonrelativistic dyon - dyon scattering cross section near the forward direction is @xcite @xmath197 { 1\\over(\\theta/2)^4},\\quad \\theta\\ll1,\\ ] ] the expected generalization of the rutherford scattering cross section at small angles .",
    "of course , the true structure of the magnetic interaction and the resulting scattering cross section is much more complicated .",
    "for example , classical electron - monopole or dyon - dyon scattering exhibits rainbows and glories , and the quantum scattering exhibits a complicated oscillatory behavior in the backward direction @xcite .",
    "these reflect the complexities of the magnetic interaction between electrically and magnetically charged particles , which can be represented as a kind of angular momentum @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , for the purpose of extracting qualitative information , the naive substitution , @xmath198 seems a reasonable first step . ] which reduces the quoted mass limits of ref .",
    "@xcite a bit . ]",
    "indeed , such a substitution was used in the proposal @xcite to estimate production rates of monopoles at fermilab .",
    "the situation is somewhat less clear for the virtual processes considered here .",
    "nevertheless , the interaction ( [ mmint ] ) suggests there should , in general , be a softening of the vertex . in the current absence of a valid calculational scheme",
    ", we will merely suggest two plausible alternatives to the mere replacement procedure adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first suggest , as seemingly ref .",
    "@xcite does , that the approximate effective vertex incorporates an additional factor of @xmath18 .",
    "thus we propose the following estimate for the @xmath199 cross section in place of eq .",
    "( [ monocs ] ) , @xmath200 since there are four suppression factors in the amplitude .",
    "now a considerably larger value of @xmath17 is consistent with unitarity , @xmath201 if we take @xmath186 again .",
    "we now must re - examine the @xmath202 cross section .    in the model given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the photon energy distribution is given in terms of the functions @xmath203 , @xmath204 , the physical cross section is given by @xmath205 where now ( _ cf . _",
    "( 25 ) of in the first reference in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath206 where , for spin 1/2 , ( up to factors of order unity ) @xmath207 the result in ( [ newdsigma ] ) differs from that in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath208 .",
    "the photon distribution function @xmath209 used is rather strongly peaked at @xmath210 .",
    "( this peaking is necessary to have any chance of satisfying the low - frequency criterion . )",
    "when we multiply by @xmath211 , the amplitude is greatly reduced and the peak is shifted above @xmath212 , violating even the naive criterion for the validity of perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , the integral of the distribution function is reduced by two orders of magnitude , that is , @xmath213 this reduces the mass limit quoted in @xcite by a factor of @xmath214 , to about 500 gev , where @xmath215 .",
    "this dubious result makes us conclude that it is impossible to derive any limit for the monopole mass from the present data .    as for the de rjula limit , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 , proportional to @xmath218 in each case , once again ignoring both the string and the radiative correction problem .",
    "he assumes that the monopole is a heavy vector - like fermion , and obtains a limit of @xmath219 .",
    "our ansatz changes @xmath218 to @xmath220 , so that @xmath221 gev , a substantial reduction . ] from the @xmath10 process , if we insert a suppression factor of @xmath18 at each vertex and integrate over the final state photon distributions , given by eq .  (",
    "18 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass limit is reduced to @xmath222 gev , again grossly violating the low energy criterion . and the limit deduced from the vacuum polarization correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon due to virtual monopole pairs @xcite is reduced to about 2 gev .",
    "the reader might object that this @xmath18 softening of the vertex has little field - theoretic basis .",
    "therefore , we propose a second possibility that does have such a basis .",
    "the vertex ( [ mmvertex ] ) suggests , and detailed calculation supports ( based on the tensor structure of the photon amplitudes , when @xmath29 points in the time direction . apart from this different tensor structure , the vacuum polarization is given by exactly the usual formula , found , for example in ref .",
    "details of this and related calculations will be given elsewhere .",
    "] ) the introduction of the string - dependent factor @xmath223 at each vertex , where @xmath21 is the photon momentum .",
    "such a factor is devastating to the indirect monopole searches  for any process involving a real photon , such as that of the d0 experiment @xcite or for @xmath10 discussed in @xcite , the amplitude vanishes . because such factors can and do appear in full monopole calculations , it is clearly premature to claim any limits based on virtual processes involving real final - state photons .",
    "the field theory of magnetic charge is still in a rather primitive state .",
    "indeed , it has been in an arrested state of development for the past two decades . with serious limits",
    "now being announced based on laboratory measurements , it is crucial that the theory be raised to a useful level .    at the present time , we believe that theoretical estimates for the production of real monopoles are more reliable than are those for virtual processes .",
    "this is because , in effect , the former are dominated by tree - level processes .",
    "we have indicated why the indirect limits can not be taken seriously at present ; and of course only the real production processes offer the potential of discovery . perhaps the arguments here will stimulate readers to contribute to the further development of the theory , for it remains an embarrassment that there is no well - defined quantum field theory of magnetic charge .",
    "we are very pleased to dedicate this paper to kurt haller on the occasion of his 70th birthday , in view of his many contributions to non - abelian gauge theory , of which dual qed is a disguised variant .",
