    "the nature and degree of correlations in fe - based superconductors has been a subject of intensive discussions since the discovery of the first high-@xmath8 iron pnictide superconductor in 2008  @xcite .",
    "a significant amount of work has concentrated on the description of experimentally observed effects of correlation like large effective masses or possible non - fermi liquid behavior  @xcite . due to the multi - orbital nature of fe - based superconductors ,",
    "the hund s coupling @xmath4 has been shown to play a key role in determining the behavior of these systems  @xcite .",
    "however , there is an ongoing debate regarding the role of @xmath4 versus the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath5 and the interpretation of the correlated nature of fe - pnictides and fe - chalcogenides  @xcite .",
    "an important feature observed in many of these studies is that , depending on the electronic filling , the hund s coupling @xmath4 on the one hand renders a moderately correlated system even more correlated and pushes it into a bad metal regime , while on the other hand it can also reestablish a metallic behavior , albeit orbital selective , in a strongly correlated system  @xcite .",
    "the main question for the fe - based superconductors narrows down to which regime of parameters do they belong to and how do correlations manifest in a wide range of binding energies as a function of doping and/or pressure ?    of special interest are the hole - doped @xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( @xmath2 , rb , cs ) end members of the 122 iron pnictide series .",
    "compared to the parent compound bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 , the substitution of ba by k accounts for a doping of one hole per formula unit and it is accompanied by a complete suppression of any structural or magnetic phase transition  @xcite and by the appearance of superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "this behavior is common  @xcite to all hole - doped end members @xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 and they all seem to have a nodal gap structure  @xcite , which is different to the nodeless gap structure found in the parent bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 system  @xcite .",
    "further , experimentally ba@xmath9k@xmath10fe@xmath1as@xmath1 is thought to undergo a coherence - incoherence transition  @xcite as a function of temperature , that has been interpreted in terms of a strong increase in correlations  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the sommerfeld coefficient suggest that the hole - doped end systems are among the strongest correlated 122 iron - pnictide superconductors  @xcite , which is also corroborated by theoretical investigations on kfe@xmath1as@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the measured sommerfeld coefficient increases from bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 to kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 by more than an order of magnitude  @xcite and increases further as k is substituted by rb and cs  @xcite . in view of these observations , the hole doped end members @xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 provide an ideal background for investigating correlation effects as function of _ negative _ pressure .    in the present work we analyze via a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) with dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) the electronic structure of the series @xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( @xmath2 , rb , cs ) as well as the fictitious frfe@xmath1as@xmath1 and @xmath3-axis stretched csfe@xmath1as@xmath1 in an extended range of binding energies .",
    "the combination of density functional theory with many body methods such as dynamical mean field theory has proven to be a very helpful tool to investigate electronic correlation effects  @xcite . while a compression of the unit cell usually decreases correlation effects in the 122 iron pnictides  @xcite , similarly , the opposite is to be expected when lattice parameters are expanded since the larger interatomic distances should reduce the hybridization of neighboring atomic orbitals and lead to stronger localization of the electronic states .",
    "we show in this study that these considerations are correct only at first sight ; actually , the strong correlation effects in these systems are mostly governed by a subtle interplay of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we performed dft(lda ) and lda+dmft calculations on experimental structures of kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 , rbfe@xmath1as@xmath1 and csfe@xmath1as@xmath1  @xcite in tetragonal symmetry .",
    "additionally , we prepared a fictitious structure for frfe@xmath1as@xmath1 with lattice parameters and as height obtained by extrapolating the experimental parameters for afe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( a = k , rb , cs ) ( see appendix a ) .",
    "furthermore , we considered an @xmath3-axis stretched csfe@xmath1as@xmath1 structure by slightly expanding the lattice of csfe@xmath1as@xmath1 in the @xmath3-@xmath11 plane to mimic an experimental biaxial stretching of the crystal .",
    "this may be achieved experimentally by epitaxial growth of csfe@xmath1as@xmath1 on a substrate with slightly larger lattice parameter .",

    "we estimate for both systems fe @xmath6 effective masses @xmath16 between 2.2 and 4.1 ( depending on the orbital ) which lead to a renormalization of the dft(lda ) band energies and overall reduction of bandwidth .",
    "the average effective mass increases slightly from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , which indicates an increase in correlation along the @xmath0fe@xmath1as@xmath1 series due to enhanced localization of electrons on fe . already at the fermi level",

    "ev coherent features become visible again , which correspond to the as @xmath22 states that partially hybridize with fe @xmath6 states .",
    "even though the self - energy in dmft has no momentum dependence , an effective momentum dependence is present in the results due to the momentum dependent orbital character of the original dft bands .",

    "this is in contrast to the dft results where the fe @xmath23 orbital contribution also increases , but is much lower and only significant for @xmath3-axis stretched csfe@xmath1as@xmath1 with shortest as height .",

    "since the electronic filling of the iron @xmath6 orbitals is larger than half - filling in these systems , the quasiparticle - like peak is located close to but below the fermi level . in fe @xmath23",
    "due to the reduction of the filling from 0.66 in kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 to 0.63 in stretched csfe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( see fig .  [ fig : filling_comp ] ) caused by an increase of electronic correlations , the quasiparticle peak - like structure is shifted even closer towards the fermi level along the series , which in turn leads to the observed increase of the density of states at the fermi level ( fig .",

    "these features do not correspond to any property found in the non - interacting dos and are purely an effect of correlations and , at first sight , are similar to the emergence of hubbard bands as a function of @xmath5 in strongly correlated systems .",
    "this is also in agreement with the @xmath24 orbital being the strongest correlated one , whereas these features are far less developed in the @xmath23 and other orbitals ( see appendix [ appendix : dos_other_orbs ] ) .",
