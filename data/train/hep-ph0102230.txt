    "hard processes in high - energy strong interactions are always localized in space - time because of the large momentum - energy transfer .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of qcd allows one to compute these cross sections perturbatively .",
    "together with the factorization theorem and the experimental information of parton distributions and fragmentation functions , hard processes in hadronic collisions have been well understood @xcite .",
    "one can then in turn use them as probes of nuclear matter as well as hot quark - gluon plasma which is expected to be formed in high - energy nuclear collisions . in particular , the propagation of an energetic parton and its induced energy loss has been proposed as a probe of the properties of dense matter formed in high - energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "based on a model of multiple scattering and induced radiation in qcd proposed by gyulassy and wang ( gw)@xcite , recent theoretical studies @xcite show that a fast parton will lose a significant amount of energy via induced radiation when it propagates through a hot partonic matter .",
    "the most interesting feature of the result is the quadratical distance dependence of the total energy loss because of the non - abelian nature of qcd radiation and the landau - pomercanchuk - migdal ( lpm ) @xcite interference .",
    "such a quadratical distance dependence is also a consequence of the gw static color - screened potential model for multiple scattering where colors are screened but not confined . in this paper",
    "we will study parton multiple scattering inside a nucleus where colors are confined to the size of a nucleon . in this case",
    "parton propagation will certainly be different from that in a partonic matter and one should expect that the parton energy loss to be related to the nucleon size or confinement scale .",
    "parton energy loss in @xmath0 dis has been studied before within various models of intranuclear scattering and the modification of hadronization @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study the problem in the framework of multiple parton scattering in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "unlike the situation in qed , the energy loss of a parton can not be directly measured because partons are not the final experimentally observed particles .",
    "the total energy of a jet as traditionally defined by a cluster of hadrons in the phase space will not change much due to medium induced radiation because a jet so defined contains particles both from the leading parton and from the radiated gluons .",
    "this is particularly the case if multiple scattering and induced radiation do not _ dramatically _ change the energy profile of the jet in phase - space .",
    "it is also virtually impossible to determine the jet energy event by event because of the large background and its fluctuation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one then has to resort to particle distributions within a jet and study the effect of parton energy loss by measuring the modification of the particle distribution due to multiple scattering and induced radiation @xcite .",
    "one such distribution is the fragmentation function of the produced parton , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fractional energy of the parton @xmath3 carried by the produced particles @xmath4 .",
    "unlike the situation that has been considered in most of the recent theoretical studies @xcite of parton energy loss of an on - shell parton during its propagation through medium , partons produced in hard processes are normally far off - shell characterized by the momentum scale @xmath5 .",
    "final - state radiation of these off - shell partons in free space , such as in @xmath6 annihilation , leads to the @xmath7-dependence of the fragmentation functions as given by dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite qcd evolution equations , @xmath8 ,   \\label{eq : ap1 } \\\\",

    ", it will suffer multiple scattering and induced radiation that will then lead to medium modification of the dglap evolution of the parton fragmentation functions . in this paper",
    "we will derive such modified evolution equations for parton fragmentation functions in the simplest case of deeply inelastic @xmath0 scattering ( dis ) .",
    "multiple scattering and induced radiation suffered by the leading quark in this case will give rise to an additional term in the dglap evolution equations . as a consequence ,",
    "the modified fragmentation functions become softer .",
    "this can be directly translated into the energy loss of the leading quark .",
    "the study here is very similar to that by luo , qiu and sterman ( lqs ) @xcite on nuclear dependence of jet cross section in deeply inelastic scattering .",
    "the difference is that they considered large transverse momentum jet production whereas we will concentrate on soft gluon emission which is responsible for the dglap evolution equations of fragmentation functions .",
    "depending on the fractional momentum carried by the second parton in the case of double parton scattering , one can categorize the processes into soft - hard , hard - hard and their corresponding interferences . in their study of large transverse momentum jet production ,",
    "lqs only considered soft - hard and hard - hard processes , because the interference terms become negligible as we will show .",
    "since we have to consider soft gluon emission , the interference terms are very important and they will cancel contributions from hard - hard and hard - soft processes in the limit of collinear emission ( or zero transverse momentum ) . in this paper , we will include all these processes and treat them in the same manner . utilizing the generalized factorization of higher - twist parton distributions , we find that each process in the double scattering probes different twist - four parton correlation of the nuclear medium . as a result of the sum of all contributions ,",
    "the additional term in the modified dglap evolution equation is proportional to the combined twist - four matrix element , @xmath10 with @xmath7 the typical transverse momentum or factorization scale and @xmath2 the fractional momentum of the emitted gluon . in this paper , we denote the four - momentum of the virtual photon and the target nucleon in dis as @xmath11 , \\label{eq : frame } \\nonumber \\\\",

    ", one can identify @xmath13 as the formation time of the emitted gluons . for large formation time as compared to the nuclear size , the above matrix element vanishes , demonstrating a typical lpm interference effect .",
    "this is because the emitted gluon ( with long formation time ) and the leading quark are still a coherent system when they propagate through the nucleus .",
    "additional scattering will not induce more gluon radiation , thus limiting the energy loss of the leading quark .",
    "the reduction of phase space available for gluon radiation due to the lpm interference effect is critical for applying the lqs formalism to the problem in this paper . in the original lqs approach @xcite ,",
    "the generalized factorization for processes with a large final transverse momentum @xmath14 allows one to consider the leading contribution in @xmath15 which is enhanced by the nuclear size @xmath16 . for large @xmath17 and @xmath18 , higher - twist contribution from double parton rescattering that is proportional to @xmath19",
    "will then be the leading nuclear correction .",
    "one can neglect contributions from more than two parton rescattering . in deriving the modified fragmentation functions",
    ", we however have to take the leading logarithmic approximation in the limit @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the transverse momentum of the radiated gluon .",
    "since the lpm interference suppresses gluon radiation whose formation time ( @xmath22 ) is larger than the nuclear size @xmath23 in our chosen frame , @xmath24 should then have a minimum value of @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the nucleon mass .",
    "therefore , the logarithmic approximation is still valid for large nuclei ( @xmath27 ) . in the meantime",
    ", the leading higher - twist contribution proportional to @xmath28 can still be small for large @xmath17 so that one can neglect processes with more than two parton rescattering .",
    "the parameter for twist expansion of the fragmentation processes inside a nucleus is thus @xmath29 as compared to @xmath30 for processes with large final transverse momentum as studied by lqs @xcite .",
    "this is why the nuclear modification to the fragmentation function as derived in this paper depends quadratically on the nuclear size @xmath31 .",
    "since our approach allows us to relate the energy loss of a fast parton to the parton correlations in the medium , the final results will be sensitive to the properties of the medium through which a produced parton propagates .",
    "in particular , the medium - dependence of the above matrix elements in a deconfined quark - gluon plasma will be very different from that in an ordinary nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , the parton energy loss and its dependence on the medium size in hadronic matter are expected to differ from that in a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this simply reflects the different parton correlations in different types of media .",
    "the results of the present study were already reported in ref .",
    "we will provide a detailed derivation and discussion in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we give a brief overview of the framework of our study including generalized factorization of twist - four parton distributions in hard processes . in section iii",
    "we will discuss in detail the calculation of different contributions to soft gluon emission involving double parton scattering . to simplify the calculation , we will use the techniques of helicity amplitude with soft gluon approximation ( @xmath32 ) . in section iv , we will consider virtual corrections from unitary constraints .",
    "we will then define , in section v , the effective parton fragmentation functions in deeply inelastic @xmath0 collisions and derive the modified dglap evolution equations .",
