    "the prevailing picture of common type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) is that they are explosions of degenerate carbon - oxygen white dwarfs that undergo a thermonuclear runaway when they reach the chandrasekhar limit as a result of mass transfer in some type of close binary stellar system @xcite . two categories of progenitor system are considered promising : a `` single degenerate '' system comprising a single white dwarf that accretes from a companion main sequence , helium , or red giant star @xcite and a `` double degenerate '' system in which two white dwarfs merge after losing angular momentum by gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the diversity of observed sne  ia suggests that more than a single scenario may operate @xcite .",
    "possible sn  ia progenitor systems have been discussed recently by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the mechanism by which the explosion proceeds in white dwarfs remains poorly understood .",
    "thermonuclear runaway models involving a pure detonation ( a supersonic shock wave ) appear to be ruled out because they predict that the white dwarf would be nearly entirely incinerated to iron - group elements , chiefly @xmath3ni , whereas observed spectra of sne  ia show substantial quantities of intermediate mass elements .",
    "similarly , models involving a pure deflagration ( a subsonic burning wave ) are ruled out because the convectively unstable deflagration front effectively mixes all elements radially , whereas observed spectra and light curves suggest a layered structure with intermediate mass elements on the outside and nickel - iron on the inside .",
    "@xcite proposed that sn  ia light curves could be explained empirically by a `` delayed detonation '' scenario in which the explosion starts in the core as a deflagration wave , which is followed somehow by a detonation wave of overlying unburned material which unbinds the white dwarf completely .",
    "heat conduction from the initial deflagration front pre - heats and expands the star s outer layers , lifting their electron degeneracy so that when those outer layers subsequently detonate , their explosion is softened .",
    "the consequence is that burning of the outer layers does not continue to completion , and a layered structure of intermediate mass elements is produced like that observed .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that the thermonuclear runaway of a near chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf is preceded by a century long , highly turbulent , convective , carbon - burning , `` smoldering '' phase @xcite .",
    "ignition , which occurs at around @xmath4 , is highly sensitive to temperature and density and may occur off - center and proceed along paths of least resistance determined by the fluctuating conditions around the ignition point @xcite .",
    "recent three - dimensional numerical simulations suggest that deflagration may proceed along a single dominant plume that starts off - center and breaks through to the surface of the white dwarf @xcite . while hydrodynamical calculations during the deflagration phase depend sensitively on the initial conditions at the time of the thermonuclear runaway , some calculations suggest strong mixing of partially and complete burning products throughout the wd @xcite .",
    "sn  ia explosion computations are quite challenging , involving a complex interplay of turbulent hydrodynamics , nuclear burning , conduction , radiative transfer in iron - group rich material , and perhaps magnetic fields leading to uncertainties @xcite .",
    "several key questions about expansion asymmetries and the overall characteristics of sne  ia could be resolved if one could obtain direct observations of the distribution and kinematics of elements in young sn  ia remnants .",

    "all ions are assumed to have the same velocity profile as the observed ca lines .",
    "the model spectrum for snr  1885 shown here differs slightly from that shown in fig .  4 of @xcite in that the spectrum shown here is for a narrow line of sight through the center of the remnant , whereas the spectrum in @xcite was convolved through the @xmath47 aperture of the fos .",
    "consequently the absorption lines here are slightly broader and deeper .",
    "the strengths of , , and absorptions are from a fit to the fos spectrum , while abundances of other elements are from the delayed detonation model of @xcite .",

    "these included 2010 and 2011 images taken as part of an emission line survey of the m31 nucleus encompassing the snr  1885 site obtained with wfpc3/uvis ( go:12174 , pi : z.  li ) .",

    "no h@xmath21 or [ ] emissions were detected at the location of snr  1885 in the m31 survey image data ( see  3.1 ) but absorption was detected in the filter f390 m , and also in the nominal [ ] @xmath563726 , 3729 filter ( f373n ) , which can be attributed to @xmath8 absorption ( see below ) .",
    "four different filter images detected line absorption from snr  1885 .",
    "an acs / wfc 3720   absorption image was obtained during five orbits on 14 december 2009 using the narrow passband [ ] ramp filter fr388n .",
    "the total exposure time was @xmath57 , comprising 11 separate images dithered by a four - point square dither pattern .",
    "the ramp filter was positioned so as to yield a peak transmission at the snr  1885 site of 45% for line center of the line at @xmath58 . the filter s narrow passband ( fwhm @xmath59 ; fig .",
    "[ specuv ] ) limits detection of @xmath8 absorption mainly to expansion velocities of @xmath60 , although the full @xmath61 bandpass is sensitive to velocities as high as @xmath62 .",
    "because the filter s transmission was only 2% at @xmath63 , it effectively blocked contamination from high - velocity @xmath64 absorption ( i.e. , @xmath64 blueshifted by @xmath65 km s@xmath42 is @xmath63 ) .",
    "a similar image showing absorption from snr  1885 was obtained in december 2010 using the wfc3/uvis filter f373n and taken as part of an emission line survey of the bulge of m31 .",
    "the exposure time was 2700 s. the wfc3 f373n filter has a narrower bandpass ( fwhm @xmath66 ) compared to the acs / wfc fr388n filter and a redder centroid of @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the wfc3 f373n image is sensitive to a slightly different range of 3720   velocities relative to the acs fr388n image , but still uncontaminated by @xmath64 absorption .",
    "two broad passband acs / hrc and wfc3/uvis filter images also detected the remnant s absorptions .",
    "an acs / hrc f330w image with a total exposure time of 5200 s was taken in october 2004 , and a three wfc3 f336w filter images totaling 5220 s were obtained in july 2010 .",
    "these acs / hrc f330w and wfc3/uvis f336w filters mainly provide information on an adjacent wavelength region relatively free of strong absorption features and thus are are primarily sensitive to the remnant s stellar background .",
    "however , both filters cover the line at 3441    and thus both show absorption from snr  1885 . these images are also weakly sensitive to blueshifted 3021   absorption .",
    "while these camera + filters combinations have similar bandpasses , the integrated system throughput for the wfc3/uvis f336w is nearly twice that of the acs / hrc f330w resulting in a higher s / n .",
    "imaging the remnant s required using filters sensitive to the wavelength region between 2300 and 2600  .",
    "bandpasses for the wfc3 f225w , f275w , and f336w filters are shown as shaded regions in figure [ specuv ] .",
    "the wfc3/uvis f225w filter is the best for detecting snr  1885 s absorption free from contamination from other sources .",
    "it has a fwhm @xmath67 bandpass with a peak transmission of 8.6% centered around @xmath68 , as illustrated in figure  [ specuv ] .",
    "the principal expected absorbers in this band are the strong uv resonance lines of at @xmath69 , with small contributions from @xmath70 and around @xmath68 .",
    "the filter also catches the strong lines at @xmath71 in its red wing .",
    "thus this filter s bandpass provides detection dominated by and largely free of contamination by lighter elements . in contrast , both the wfc3 f275w and the acs / hrc f250w filter have bandpasses sensitive to and in addition to ( fig .  [ specuv ] ) .",
    "a series of wfc3 f225w images of snr  1885 were obtained during nine orbits split into three visits that occurred on 17 and 21 november and 1 december 2012 .",
    "the resolution of the wfc3 camera is @xmath46 per pixel giving it a slightly better angular resolution scale than the @xmath72 of the acs / wfc image and previous wfpc2 images of and @xcite .",
    "twelve individual images were taken during each of the three visits , dithered with a primary three - point and secondary four - point pattern .",
    "there was a small error in guiding for the third set of images ( ibr803030 ) which resulted in a slightly smeared image in one direction .",
    "the images from the three visits were co - aligned with iraf tasks and stacked into one final @xmath73 exposure .",
    "one additional orbit was used to obtain an off - band image of the remnant and m31 bulge .",
    "the off - band image used the wfc3 f336w filter which has a fwhm @xmath74 bandpass with a peak transmission of 19% around @xmath75 , as illustrated in figure  [ specuv ] .",
    "the total exposure of this dithered image was @xmath76 .",
    "archival wfc3 f336w images of were also examined .",
    "ideally one would like images of snr  1885 to be spatially well - resolved and of high signal - to - noise .",
    "however , the small size ( @xmath77 diameter ) and faintness of the bulge of m31 in the ultraviolet make such images challenging to secure .",
    "moreover , interpretation can be ambiguous in wavelength bands where absorptions from multiple species and ionization states overlap .    from this perspective ,",
    "the cleanest images are the high resolution fr338n image reported by @xcite and the and images presented here . both and are expected to be the dominant ion of their element  the singly - ionized ion  and both species are expected to dominate absorption in the respective filters . as will be discussed below , the , , and images reveal distinctively different structures .",

    "taken using the 200   wide f390 m filter , the presence of snr  1885 is striking against m31 s bulge light and places the remnant in context within the galaxy s nuclear region .",
    "the remnant is visible in h & k line absorptions from the remnant s ca - rich ejecta .",
    "images such as this illustrate how prominently the remnant of sn  1885 can appear in absorption .",
    "sn 1885 fortunately exploded on the near side of the bulge , so that its expanding remnant is well back - lit by m31 bulge stars .",
    "it is also a fortuitous that the remnant s projected location lies some distance away from several m31 bulge dust lanes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : introfigs ] ) thus making analysis of the remnant s absorption less confused .",
    "although seen prominently in filter images sensitive to strong resonance lines , such as , snr  1885 is virtually invisible at nearby continuum wavelengths .",

    "the lack any any hint of the remnant in the 4600   image also indicates that sn 1885 generated virtually no appreciable dust .",
    "this situation along with the lack of any detectable h@xmath21 or [ ] line emissions associated with the remnant ( see fig.[o_n_halpha_images ] ) helps explain the lack of any optical detection of snr  1885 before its discovery by @xcite despite several searches .",

    "the peak of absorption is displaced eastward @xmath82 from remnant center in the fr388n image but slightly less so ( @xmath83 ) in the f373n image .",
    "such a difference is only marginally significant given the s / n of the data but , if real , may simply be due to differences in the two filter bandpass widths and centers .",
    "filter bandpass differences probably also account for differences seen in the darkest ( most absorbed ) regions of snr  1885 s due to 3720  ; @xmath84 and @xmath85 times the bulge background flux for the fr388n and f373n images , respectively .    more importantly , both images show an absorption patch that is distinctly smaller than that of either or @xcite .",

    "both images show weak absorption within the remnant ( as marked by the circle indicating the extent of strong absorption ) due mainly to 3441   absorption . the amount of light bulge light blocked by sn  1885 in the acs f330w and wfc3 f336w images potentially due to both 3021 and 3441 ",
    "line absorptions within the @xmath80 circles shown in figure 4 is only @xmath345% , indicating that these images are mainly continuum images .",

    "the full area of absorption is best seen in the wfc3 f336w image which has higher s / n due to greater camera + filter throughput .    while the observed off - center displacement of mass could suggest a velocity asymmetry around 3500 km s@xmath42 , similar to the maximum values obtained for sne  ia from late - time , near - ir spectra @xcite , there is reason to doubt this explanation given the similar eastern offset of the remnant s @xcite",

    "the current presence of and concentrated along the eastern half of the remnant and unexpectedly _ toward _ the m31 nucleus , suggests an important source of ionizing uv photons along the remnant s projected western hemisphere . if this is the case , the remnant s fe and ca rich ejecta in its western half could have self - shielded ejecta in the remnant s central and eastern regions leading to the different / and / absorption distributions observed .",

    "this figure also includes the broad passband acs / hrc f330w discussed above in regard to the remnant s absorption and is included here to show the stellar background and dust lanes at and around the snr  1885 site .",
    "all four images are shown using a square root intensity stretch in order to show both the remnant s absorption features and neighboring bulge features .",
    "these images show numerous bright bulge stars in the vicinity of snr  1885 which are probably mainly red giants with strong uv coronal line emissions .",
    "individual bulge stars become increasingly prominent at shorter wavelengths and are most apparent in the f225w filter image seen in the lower right panel .",
    "the f330w image , with a passband comparatively free of line absorptions suggests that with the exception of two stars along the remnant s westernmost limb , no bright foreground or background stars lie in the direction to snr  1885 .",
    "although the f225w , f250w , and f275w filter passbands cover some or all of the strong lines at @xmath87 and 2599 @xmath36 , the detected absorption in snr  1885 appears different in each filter .",
    "below , we discuss possible reasons for these differences .",
    "we begin with the acs / hrc f250w filter image which has been presented and discussed by @xcite .",
    "this image yielded the weakest detection of the remnant .",
    "given the hrc s small pixels and only a 6% integrated system throughput for the acs / hrc + f250w filter , the resulting low s / n image showed a featureless absorption spot but one whose diameter is nearly the same as that of the remnant s absorption .",
    "the f250w filter has a relatively broad passband which is starts at 2300  peaks at 2500   and extends to 3300  .",
    "this makes this filter sensitive to several strong resonance lines including , , , and .",
    "thus , this image is likely a composite of fe and mg absorption features , limiting its usefulness for determining the remnant s 2d distribution .",
    "the wfc3 f275w image is fairly similar to the f250w image but with hints of some internal structure . like that of the f250w filter ,",
    "f275w s bandpass encompassed many likely absorption lines including , , , and .",
    "the most plausible explanation of differences between the f250w and f275w images is that the f275w image is picking up substantial more absorption from resonance lines of @xmath88 and @xmath89 due to the wfc3 s higher throughput at 2800  .",
    "note that the model spectrum shown in the top panel of figure  [ specuv ] is for a line of sight directly through the center of snr  1885 .",
    "if snr  1885 has fe concentrated to the center and lighter elements concentrated in a shell , then a line of sight through the outer parts of snr  1885 would show relatively more absorption from mg and less from fe .",
    "the f225w wfc3 image ( lower right panel in figure [ uv_images ] ) provides the cleanest image of fe ii absorption in snr  1885 , uncontaminated by mg absorption features .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ specuv ] , the strongest absorption lines in the wfc3 f275w filter are @xmath90 , while the strongest lines in the wfc3 f225w filter are @xmath69 . since the strongest lines in both filters are those of , we had expected that the two images would show essentially the same structure .",
    "but this is not so : the f275w image shows absorption that is smoother , more extended , and less centrally concentrated than f225w likely due to added and absorption .",
    "the wfc3 f225w image shows a structure that differs strikingly from that of either ca or .",
    "it reveals four prominent absorption streams or plumes that extend from the center of the remnant to near the outer extent of the absorption .",
    "figure  [ fe2_closeup ] shows an enlargement of the f225w image .",
    "the four apparent streams appear clumpy , have similar thicknesses ( @xmath91 ) , and intersect at a point @xmath92 ( @xmath34 1500 km s@xmath42 ) north of the center of the remnant as defined by the remnant s absorption . while the detected absorption is strongest in these four plumes , there is also considerable absorption outside these finger - like plumes extending out to a radius @xmath34 @xmath93 ( @xmath34 10,000 km s@xmath42 ) .",
    "a major concern in interpreting the f225w image is uncertainty regarding the distribution of background stellar sources as they could affect the distribution of observed light and dark ( absorption ) features .",
    "after all , the m31 bulge around snr  1885 exhibits a high density of strong stellar sources in the f225w image .",
    "for example , a few bright uv stars located in front of or behind the remnant could potentially lead to an uneven absorption structure not unlike that seen in the f225w image .",
    "although we can not rule out this possibility , we view this as unlikely . from the predicted uv spectrum of snr  1885 shown in figure [ specuv ] , it is not possible to have a clean `` off - band '' image around 2500   from which one could determine the number and brightness of background stars toward snr  1885",
    "however , as noted above , the acs / hrc f330w image indicates no bright line - of - sight stellar contamination , especially toward the remnant s center .",
    "moreover , while the density of stars in the f225w image surrounding snr  1885 is fairly high ( @xmath94 58 stars arcsec@xmath42 , there are several immediately adjacent bulge regions just to the west @xmath95 in diameter largely free of bright stars .",
    "further , the nearly orthogonal plume structure observed in the f225w image is unlikely to be due to a chance distribution of background stars .",
    "if the similar thickness plumes intersecting near at the remnant s center and occupying only the inner 2/3rds of the remnant s radius was caused by a chance arrangement of bright background stars , then their presence would be expected to have a significant impact on the otherwise smooth and largely spherical absorption detected in between the plumes .",
    "in addition , nothing so striking in morphology as seen in the f225w image is visible in any neighboring m31 bulge dust lanes .",
    "this is shown in the upper panels of figure [ ca_fe_images ] where we present a wider and log intensity stretched view of the f225w image .",
    "the depth of the apparent absorption in snr  1885 seen in the f225w image is equal to or greater than that seen in neighboring m31 bulge dust lanes .    the darkest ( most absorbed ) regions in the f225w image of snr  1885 are less than 0.15 times the diffuse ( no stars ) bulge background flux , with the remnant s inner @xmath96 diameter region encompassing all four plumes is @xmath97 50% below that of the least bright adjacent bulge regions",
    ". the total measured flux in the f225w filter for snr  1885 within a circular region shown in figure [ ca_fe_images ] ( r = @xmath98 ) is @xmath99 that of neighboring bulge regions at similar distances from the m31 nucleus .",
    "the four plumes exhibit different projected lengths , with the one to the west extending the farthest , nearly out to the edge of the remnant s strong absorption shell ( @xmath98 ; see fig.[ca_fe_images ] ) implying a maximum transverse velocity @xmath34 10,000 km s@xmath42 .",
    "if these plumes truly trace the distribution of the remnant s fe - rich ejecta , the different lengths could arise from line of sight projections of nearly equal length plumes but expanding in different directions .",
    "snr  1885 s 2d absorption stands in stark contrast to its absorption distribution , also shown in figure [ ca_fe_images ] for easy comparison .",
    "whereas the remnant s is concentrated in a clumpy shell spanning a range 1000 to 5000 km s@xmath42 in expansion velocity , the remnant s fe - rich ejecta is concentrated in the four finger - like plumes which extend well past the ca - rich shell . of equal importance",
    "is the apparent presence of fe - rich material out to @xmath10010,000 km s@xmath42 in transverse velocity in non - plume directions .",
    "the significance of the apparent @xmath34 1500 km s@xmath42 ( @xmath39 ) off - center intersection of the absorption fingers relative to the remnant s absorption is difficult to assess given indications that the remnant s absorption is not perfectly symmetric .",
    "the maximum absorption seen in both acs fr388n and wfc3 f390w images exhibits a slight extension ( @xmath101 off the southwestern limb ; see fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the remnant s @xmath102 diameter seen in the most recent 2010 images indicates a somewhat smaller 11,900 @xmath103 km s@xmath42 transverse velocity than the 12,400 km s@xmath42 estimated by @xcite and lower but still within the uncertainty of the 13,100 @xmath103 km s@xmath42 radial velocity measured from the remnant s h & k absorption profile @xcite .",
    "small radial and transverse velocity differences might indicate a slight non - spherical expansion , meaning an apparent off - center displacement of the absorption may not be significant and not a clue for an off - center ignition point of sn  1885 .",
    "we will now discuss how the new _ hst _ observations of the remnant of s andromeda ( snr  1885 ) can be placed in context of our current understanding of type ia supernovae .",
    "the most informative _ hst _ images of snr 1885 presented above are those in absorption and absorption ( fig.[ca_fe_images ] ) .",
    "this is because both and are expected to be the dominant ion of that element so their absorption reliably traces the element as a whole , and because the absorption in the chosen filters , fr338n and f225w respectively , is dominated by the designated ion , relatively uncontaminated by absorption from other species .",
    "the presence of fe at the center of snr  1885 with ca - rich debris in a shell around the center is consistent with sn  1885 being a type  ia supernova , albeit likely a subluminous sn  ia .",
    "because its debris are still in near free expansion after 125 years , its retains the density distribution established shortly after the explosion .",
    "thus , the distribution of elements in snr  1885 can provide valuable kinematic information about the general properties and character of a type  ia explosion .",
    "consistent with evidence from sne  ia light curves , the remnant of sn  1885 shows evidence for both deflagration and detonation .",
    "a characteristic signature of detonations is an approximately spherically symmetric layered structure of burned elements .",
    "hence , the shell - like appearance of , an incompletely burned element , points to a detonation explosion .",
    "_ hst _ images show a layered structure for the intermediate mass elements such as ca in snr  1885 @xcite ; specifically , the presence of inner clumps of ca at velocities between 1,000 and 5,000 km s@xmath42 along with ca debris with expansion velocity out to @xmath3412,500 km s@xmath42 and thus is strongly suggestive of a detonation phase .",
    "in contrast , the f225w image of snr  1885 shows several finger - like plumes that extend from the center out to an expansion velocity of about @xmath0 , near the outer edge of the absorption .",
    "the length scale of the lumps seen in snr  1885 is consistent with rayleigh - taylor instabilities commonly found in sne  ia simulations during the early deflagration phase .",
    "though the image shows just four plumes , this may be a projection effect when combining a small number of plumes . in summary ,",
    "the combined ca and fe distributions in the remnant of sn 1885 is in line with an off - center delayed detonation sn  ia event .",
    "for sne  ia , several explosion scenarios are possible including classical delayed detonation , pulsating delayed - detonation models @xcite , or dynamical merger models @xcite . for the newly recognized subclass , sne  iax @xcite , models suggested include deflagration models with burning of the outer layers of a wd @xcite or pulsating delayed detonation models @xcite .",
    "however , the seeming lack of appreciable ca - rich material in the center argues against strong mixing and in favor of the explosion of a massive wds . the fact of limited mixing of the inner region and the constraint of plumes to the low velocities seen compared to the mixing predicted by hydro - models @xcite suggest some suppression of the rayleigh - taylor instability possibly through strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we split the following discussion into in the constrains for @xmath104 mass models or , more precisely , the constraints for the deflagration phase of burning , arising from dynamical wd mergers and in the framework of sne  iax .",
    "the approximately spherically symmetric distribution of in contrast to plumes which extend in different directions argues against an explosion with a preferred symmetry axis as might result from an anisotropic merger of two white dwarfs .    within the framework of merging wds",
    ", the large angular momentum will impose a preferred axis of symmetry which should be apparent in our 2d images but is clearly not the case .",
    "a detonation front is responsible for burning without time for the formation of chemical clumps and mixing .",
    "thus , none of the dynamical models show large scale , irregular structures if the merging occurs on time scales of the orbiting wds .",
    "one exception are the type of violent , dynamical mergers in which two wds collide .",
    "simulations show that some of the fe - rich material is squeezed out into a thin , ` cone - like ' structure which can extend to high velocities .",
    "instabilities by the decay of radioactive @xmath3ni over the time may produce clumps in the thin structure .",
    "however , we see several structures without a regular pattern and thus the distribution of the intermediate element of ca in snr  1885 seems to be inconsistent with this model .",
    "finally we consider sn  iax events which have been classified as a new type of thermonuclear explosions . though the prototype , sn  2002cx was several magnitudes dimmer than s andromeda , the recent sn  2014z extended the range to @xmath105 mag , similar to s andromeda .",
    "what sets sne  iax apart from normal sne  ia is that the former does not show a brightness decline relation and spectra similar to sn  1991 t .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the light curve of s andromeda given its location against the bright m31 bulge background , sne  iax may well be compatible .",
    "the nature of sne  iax is currently under debate and may include deflagration burning and ejection of the outer layers of a wd leading to a low density shell @xcite and/or pulsating delayed detonation models @xcite . the low - ejecta mass of the first class is unlikely because it in conflict with the long time scale of re - ionization and the layered structure .",
    "however , pulsation delayed - detonation models can not be excluded because they can have a wide variety of mixing during the pulsation , and show a layered structure in the outer layers .",
    "an alternative interpretation to the structure may be various amounts of mixing during the or multiple pulsations of the wd .",
    "the remnant of the probable type  ia remnant of sn  1885 ( s and ) in the bulge of m31 is visible in absorption against the background of bulge stars .",
    "images of the remnant of sn  1885 in m31 show the following :    \\1 ) the distribution of material appears small ( @xmath93 ) , and offset to the east by approximately @xmath106 from remnant center .",
    "while this displacement might indicate a velocity asymmetry of the remnant s fe - rich material like that proposed by @xcite based on near - ir spectral observations of sne  ia , a similar displacement of the remnant s absorption suggests it is due to an uneven ionizing uv flux local to the remnant .",
    "\\2 ) a deep uv image sensitive mainly to resonance lines at @xmath107 shows an irregular shaped absorption structure peaked in strength at the center of the remnant with four plume - like extensions of especially strong absorption which weaken and terminate near the remnant s outer boundary as marked by the remnant s absorption extent .",
    "the key result of this paper has been to present a spatially resolved _",
    "image of the supernova remnant in absorption in the strong resonance doublet of and to compare that image to a previously obtained absorption image in  h  &  k. since and are expected to be the dominant ions of their respective elements , the images in these lines trace the bulk of iron and calcium in snr  1885 .",
    "since the remnant is still in free expansion at the present time , some 130  years after the explosion , the distribution of elements remains that established shortly after the explosion , thereby giving valuable insight on the details of the explosion process .",
    "our finding that iron , the dominant outcome of nuclear burning to completion , shows four plumes that start at the center of the remnant and reach out to a maximum velocity of @xmath0 , near the maximum extent of ca is especially significant .",
    "calcium , a partially burned element , is by contrast concentrated in a broad and lumpy shell spanning 1000 to 5000 @xmath108 and extending out to a maximum of @xmath2 .    the observed distribution of iron and calcium in the remnant of s and is consistent with delayed detonation models of type  ia explosions , in which the explosion begins as a deflagration at the center of a white dwarf , which later transitions to a detonation .",
    "the deflagration drives rayleigh - taylor unstable plumes to near the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "this deflagration burning heats and expands the white dwarf so that when the explosion turns into a detonation , unburned elements are burned not to completion but rather to intermediate mass elements , such as the calcium observed in the s and remnant .",
    "progenitors with @xmath104 mass and , in particular , off - center delayed detonation models are favored by observations including our previous studies of s  and . however , such models have difficulty when taking into account the predicted burning instabilities and mixing during the deflagration phase both with respect to the brightness decline relation , late - time ir spectra and , at least for subluminous sne  ia , in early time and maximum light optical and ir spectra .",
    "the structure observed in s and may serve as a benchmark to decipher the mechanism to partially suppress instabilities .",
    "moreover , the evidence for the rayleigh - taylor instabilities suggested by the s and observations reported here support the validity of @xmath104 models which require a deflagration phase and dis - favor dynamical or violent mergers .     + this research was supported by nasa through grants go-10722 and go-12609 from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , and the nsf through grants ast-0708855 and ast-1008962 to pah .",

    "<S> hst _ absorption images of s and , of which the highest quality and theoretically cleanest is  h  &  k. because the remnant is still in free expansion , these images provide a 2d look at the distribution of iron synthesized in this probable type  ia explosion , thus providing insights and constraints for theoretical sn  ia models . </S>",
    "<S> the images show extended absorption offset to the east from the remnant s center as defined by images and is likely an ionization effect due to self - shielding . </S>",
    "<S> more significant is the remnant s apparent distribution which consists of four streams or plumes of fe - rich material seen in absorption that extend from remnant center out to about @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the remnant s absorption , which is concentrated in a clumpy , broken shell spanning velocities of @xmath1 but which extends out to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed distributions of ca and fe rich ejecta in the sn  1885 remnant are consistent with delayed detonation white dwarf models . </S>",
    "<S> the largely spherical symmetry of the ca - rich layer argues against a highly anisotropic explosion as might result from a violent merger of two white dwarfs . </S>"
