    "in @xcite ( 2013 ; hereafter paper i ) we studied a sample of 296 faint ( @xmath2  mjy ) sources selected from the tenth cambridge survey ( 10c ; @xcite ) at 15.7  ghz in the lockman hole .",
    "the 10c survey was made with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; @xcite ) and covers ten fields complete to 0.5  mjy , two of which are in the lockman hole . by matching the 10c catalogue to several lower - frequency surveys we investigated the radio spectral properties of the sources in this sample .",
    "we found a significant change in spectral index @xmath3 with flux density @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 for frequency @xmath6 )  the median spectral index between 15.7  ghz and 610  mhz changes from @xmath7 for 15.7-ghz flux densities @xmath8 to @xmath9 for lower flux densities ( @xmath10 ) ( full details of this study are given in paper i ) .",
    "this suggests that a population of faint , flat - spectrum sources is emerging at flux densities @xmath11 .    the properties of the 10c sample were compared with those of a sample of sources selected from the skads simulated sky ( s@xmath12 ; @xcite ) ( full details are in paper i ) .",
    "we found that this simulation fails to reproduce the observed spectral index distribution and underpredicts the number of sources in the faintest flux density bin ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we discussed two possible origins for this discrepancy .",
    "the first is that the source population at this flux density level is not dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the form of fanaroff and riley type i ( fri ; @xcite ) sources , as predicted by the s@xmath12 model , and is instead dominated by a population with flatter spectra , such as , for example , a population of starburst galaxies with unusually flat high - frequency spectra @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is that fri sources are not modelled correctly in the simulation and in fact themselves have much flatter spectra at high frequencies . in paper",
    "i we suggested that the first option is unlikely , as it would require the number of starburst sources to be incorrect in the simulation by at least a factor of ten .",
    "information about the structure of the sources in a sample can provide useful information about their nature , meaning that high resolution studies are valuable when investigating the properties of a population .",
    "the angular size of sources in the high frequency ( 20  ghz ) source population at much higher flux densities ( @xmath14 ) has recently been investigated by @xcite .",
    "they used data from a 6  km baseline to split the sample into different populations and investigate their properties .",
    "they found that 77 percent of their sample are compact agns and 23 percent are extended agn - powered sources .",
    "here we study a sample of high frequency sources which are considerably fainter on even smaller angular scales .",
    "in this paper we use recently published vlbi data ( , hereafter m2013 ) to investigate further the nature of this faint 15.7-ghz source population .",
    "m2013 have recently conducted wide - field observations with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 1.4  ghz of part of the lockman hole .",
    "the vlba provides milliarcsec - scale resolution , so if a source is detected the emission must come from a very compact region and the brightness temperature must be very high ( @xmath15 k ) .",
    "any stellar non - thermal sources , such as supernova remnants , at redshift @xmath16 can not have a surface brightness this high and thus any objects with @xmath17 which are detected must originate in agn .    in section [ section : methods ] the different samples used in this paper are defined and the methods used to investigate the properties of these samples are described . the results and discussion",
    "are split into two parts  the first part , section [ section : results1 ] , discusses the properties of the 10c sources in the vlba survey area and the second part , section [ section : results2 ] , contains further insights into the nature of the m2013 vlba sources .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ section : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper",
    "the term ` flat spectrum ' refers to an object with spectral index @xmath18 , ` steep spectrum ' to an object with @xmath19 and ` rising ' to an object with @xmath20 .",
    "m2013 used a 1.4-ghz vla image of the lockman hole field by @xcite to identify a sample of sources which could in principle be detected with the vlba observations provided all the flux comes from a very compact ( milli - arcsecond scale ) region .",
    "they defined a source as ` detectable ' if its peak vla flux density is @xmath21 times the noise in the vlba image at that point .",
    "they found that 217 sources fitted these criteria  we refer to this sample as the middelberg sample .",
    "m2013 made naturally weighted images , with a median resolution of @xmath22 , at the positions of each of the 217 sources to detect , or place limits on , any millarcsecond - scale components .",
    "images with uniform weighting , with a median resolution of @xmath23 , were used to calculate the integrated flux density of each detected source .",
    "sixty - five of the sources in the middelberg sample were actually detected in the vlba observations , using the @xmath24 threshold for detection .",
    "these sources form the ` vlba - detected ' sample .",
    "redshift information is available for 47 out of the 65 vlba - detected sources from the @xcite photometric redshift catalogue .",
    "the redshift values for these sources all lie in the range @xmath25 , meaning that all vlba - detected sources must have the very high brightness temperatures which can only be found in agn ( see section [ section : intro ] ) .",
    "the 10c survey was observed with ami at 15.7  ghz and covers ten fields , one of which contains the area covered by the m2013 vlba survey in the lockman hole . in this area",
    "the 10c survey is complete to 0.5  mjy . in paper",
    "i we presented spectral information about the 10c sources obtained by matching the catalogue to a deep giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) survey at 610  mhz @xcite , a westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) survey at 1.4 ghz @xcite , the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - one centimetres ( first ; @xcite ) .",
    "the m2013 observations consist of three pointings with an r.m.s .",
    "noise of 24  @xmath26jy beam@xmath27 towards the pointing centre .",
    "the 10c and middelberg catalogues were matched in topcat using a match radius of 15 arcsec .",
    "this match radius was chosen to minimise the number of false detections by matching to a shifted distribution of sources in the same way as described in paper i. there are 51 10c sources in the vlba survey area , of which 44 match to a source in the middelberg sample .",
    "these 44 sources should therefore be bright enough at 1.4-ghz to be detectable with the vlba if all their flux is in a compact core .",
    "thirty - three of these 44 10c sources are actually detected by the vlba observations .",
    "the seven 10c sources which are not in the middelberg sample ( which would therefore not be detectable by the vlba observations ) have rising spectra , with typical values of @xmath28 , and therefore fall below the vlba - detectable flux density limit at 1.4  ghz ( note that all 10c sources are found in the @xcite deep vla image ) .    in two separate cases a second vlba source falls within the contours of a 10c source which is already matched to a different vlba source . in both cases ,",
    "the second vlba source is more than 15 arcsec ( the radius used for matching ) away from the 10c source position , so is not counted as a match .",
    "the first case ( 10c i d 10cj105115 + 573552 ) appears as an extended source in the 10c map ( resolution @xmath29  arcsec ) . in the higher - resolution gmrt map ( synthesised beam @xmath30 ) this source is resolved into two separate compact sources and the two vlba sources correspond to these two separate sources .",
    "it is likely that both vlba sources are seen in the 10c map but they are blended together .",
    "if this is the case , it will mean that the 15.7-ghz flux density of the matched vlba source is over estimated , as it also contains some contribution from the second vlba source .",
    "the matched vlba source has a steep spectum ( @xmath31 ) , so if the 15.7-ghz flux density is over - estimated the spectrum may be steeper still . in the second case ( 10c i d 10cj105237 + 573058 ) , the higher - resolution gmrt images reveal that the vlba source which is closer to the 10c source position corresponds to the core of an extended double - lobed radio source , while nothing is visible in the gmrt map at the position of the second vlba source .",
    "this is probably because this source is very faint ( @xmath32 ) , so falls below the detection limit of the gmrt observations .",
    "the positions of the 10c sources in the middelberg sample and the vlba - detected sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : source - map ] and the different samples are summarised in table [ tab : samples ] .",
    ".summary of the different samples used in this paper .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      thirty of the middelberg sources which are detected by the vlba observations do not have a match in the 10c catalogue .",
    "for each of these unmatched vlba sources the 10c image was examined to see if there was a source present which was below the 10c catalogue limit . in 14 cases a source was visible within 15 arcsec of the vlba position with a peak flux density greater than @xmath33 .",
    "for these 14 sources the 15.7-ghz flux density was estimated from the 10c image using the aips task jmfit . in four cases jmfit",
    "did not converge due to the presence of a nearby bright source ; for these sources the flux density was found manually using the aips task tvstat . for the remaining unmatched sources an upper limit of three times the local noise in the 10c map",
    "was placed on the 15.7-ghz flux density .      in sections [ section :",
    "results1 ] and [ section : results2 ] radio spectral index , @xmath3 , ( where @xmath34 for flux density @xmath4 at frequency @xmath6 ) , is used to investigate source properties .    in section [ section : results1 ]",
    ", for sources in the 10c sample , @xmath35 and @xmath36 values from paper i are used .    in section [ section : results2 ] the spectral index , or a lower limit on the spectral index , between 15.7  ghz and 1.4  ghz ( @xmath35 ) was calculated for all 65 sources detected by the vlba observations . for consistency ,",
    "the 1.4-ghz flux densities used were the integrated flux densities from the vla observations by @xcite used in m2013 .",
    "the 15.7-ghz flux densities were either the integrated flux densities taken from the 10c catalogue or , for those sources without a match in the 10c catalogue , the values determined from the 10c map or the upper limit on the 10c flux density derived from the 10c map ( see section [ section : unmatched - vlbi ] ) .      in this study",
    "we use two different measures of source morphology , which give us information about the size of the source on different scales , as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) vla size , @xmath37  the maximum angular size taken from the @xcite 1.4-ghz vla catalogue . for single sources",
    "this value corresponds to twice the maximum full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the fitted gaussian and gives information about whether or not the source is resolved on an arcsecond scale .",
    "the fwhm synthesised beam size is @xmath38  arcsec so values of @xmath39  arcsec indicate that the source is resolved .",
    "\\(2 ) ratio @xmath40 of the vla integrated flux density to the vlba integrated flux density ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this gives information about whether the source is dominated by compact emission ( @xmath42 ) , in which case @xmath43 , or whether there is significant emission from a more extended region .",

    "this is much higher than the percentage of sources in the total middelberg sample which are detected by the vlba observations ( 65 out of 217 i.e. 30 percent ) .",
    "however nothing significant can be deduced from this since the sources in the 10c sample have higher 1.4-ghz flux densities than the majority of sources in the middelberg sample ( e.g. 14 percent of the 10c sources in the middelberg sample have @xmath50  mjy compared with 75 percent of sources in the total middelberg sample ) and , as shown in m2013 , the probability of detection is a strong function of flux density .",

    "the flux density distribution of the 10c vlba - detected sources is similar to that of the 10c sources in the middelberg sample ( although , significantly , all seven of the brightest sources with @xmath51  mjy are detected by the vlba observations ) .",
    "there are vlba - detected sources with 15.7-ghz flux densities as low as @xmath52  mjy so we are finding vlbi components in the majority of the faintest 10c sources .    the fact that 75 percent of the 10c sources in the middelberg sample are detected by the vlba observations , and therefore must be agn , rules out the possibility discussed in paper i that the 10c population is dominated by starburst galaxies .",
    "these results therefore support the conclusions in paper i that the majority of the 10c population are agn , such as fri sources .",
    "thus the proportions of sources in s@xmath12 , which predicts that the faint , high frequency population is dominated by fri sources , may well be correct .",
    "if this is the case , the emission from the fri sources must be modelled incorrectly , because , as described in section [ section : intro ] , the simulation does not accurately reproduce the observed spectral index distribution .",
    "this is probably due to incorrect modelling of the emission from the cores of fri sources ( for example , there is no attempt to include the effectes self - absorption in compact objects ) , as well as the lack of spectral aging in the overall source model .      the spectral index distribution of the 44 10c sources in the middelberg sample and the 33 detected in the vlba observations are shown in fig .",

    "there is a larger spread in values of @xmath56 than of @xmath35 , particularly towards negative values ; 14 of the sources which display a flat or rising spectrum between 610  mhz and 1.4  ghz ( @xmath58 ) have turned over and have a steep spectrum ( @xmath19 ) by 15.7  ghz .",
    "all but two of the 10c sources detected by the vlba observations have flat spectra ; this is not suprising as flat spectrum emission generally originates from compact core regions , which are much more likely to have a high enough surface brightness to be visible in the vlba observations .",
    "conversely , steep spectrum emission tends to come from more extended regions , which do not have high enough surface brightness to be detectable with the vlba observations ",
    "consistent with the fact that most of the 10c sources not detected by the vlba observations have steep spectra .",
    "the majority of these undetected sources have a spectrum which steepens with frequency , supporting the idea that these sources do not have a dominant core , as this would contribute more to the flux density at higher frequencies .",
