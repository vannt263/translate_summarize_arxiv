    "in contrast , the ce@xmath0ni@xmath0 in compound exhibits features characteristic of intermediate valence systems , with partly delocalized @xmath10 electrons of cerium  @xcite .",
    "since both compounds are isostructural , the qualitative difference in their ground states results exclusively from swapping copper atoms for nickel atoms .",
    "this fact motivated us to perform alloying studies of ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in as a unique opportunity to investigate an evolution of a @xmath10 system from fully localized regime to well defined intermediate valence state , that is predicted by the doniach diagram @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that systematic studies of such evolution are often difficult ( or even impossible ) due to either relatively small difference between the ground states of two isostructural parent compounds or different crystal structures of the two terminal phases . in other words ,",
    "such experimental studies usually cover only part of the doniach diagram , e.g. quantum critical region .",
    "in this paper we present the results of magnetic and electrical transport measurements of the solid solution ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in , performed in a wide temperature range , using polycrystalline samples .",
    "we demonstrate a prominent evolution of the main physical characteristics of the system upon increasing nickel content , and interpret the experimental data in terms of some theoretical models developed for localized and intermediate valence states .",
    "we argue , that the cu / ni substitution leads to an increase in the exchange integral , which yields a reversal in the order of the magnetic @xmath11 and nonmagnetic @xmath12 states .",
    "moreover , the rise in the exchange integral brings about a diminishing influence of excited crystal field levels on the electrical transport in the system studied .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in were prepared by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of the elemental components in titanium gettered argon atmosphere .",
    "the pellets were turned over and remelted several times to ensure good homogeneity .",
    "no further heat treatment was given to the as cast ingots .",
    "quality of the products was verified by x - ray powder diffraction ( stoe diffractometer with cu @xmath13 radiation ) and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( phillips 515 scanning electron microscope equipped with edax pv 9800 spectrometer ) .",
    "all the diffractograms were easily indexed within the expected primitive tetragonal structure .",
    "the microprobe analysis showed that the samples are nearly single phase ( with minor traces of unidentified impurities ) and their compositions are close to the nominal ones .",
    "the magnetic properties were studied at temperatures 1.7    400  k and in magnetic fields up to 5  t using a commercial quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "electrical resistivity was measured on bar - shaped samples in zero field from 4.2  k up to room temperature , using a home - made setup .",

    "it revealed also that the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume of the ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in alloys systematically decrease ( in a quasi - linear manner ) with increasing nickel content from @xmath6  =  7.7368(6 )   , @xmath7  =  3.9240(3 )     and @xmath14  =  234.88  @xmath16 for ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in to @xmath6  =  7.5305(3 )   , @xmath7  =  3.7223(2 )     and @xmath14  =  211.09  @xmath16 for ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in  @xcite ( see ) .",

    "the obtained values of the effective magnetic moments are close to the theoretical one calculated for free ce@xmath8 ions ( i.e. 2.54  @xmath25 ) and point at the presence of well localized @xmath10 electrons of cerium .",
    "the increase in the absolute value of the weiss temperature can be ascribed to the enhancement of the hybridization strength between conduction electrons and @xmath10 shells , expected for rising the ni content .",

    ", the inverse magnetic susceptibility deviates more and more from the curie ",
    "weiss behaviour , suggesting progressive delocalization of the @xmath10 electrons ( i.e. evolution from the state @xmath3 to the configuration @xmath4 ) .",
    "according to the interconfiguration fluctuation ( icf ) model developed by sales and wohlleben  @xcite , the magnetic susceptibility of the @xmath10 electron compounds can be described as a sum of susceptibilities of two states : @xmath30 and @xmath31 . respectively ,",

    "according to this notation , in systems with the magnetic ground state @xmath3 ( e.g. magnetically ordered compounds , kondo and heavy fermion systems ) @xmath17 is positive , while in the intermediate valence systems , in which the @xmath3 configuration is the excited state , @xmath17 is negative . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the fractional occupation @xmath55 of the ground @xmath3 state is weakly dependent on temperature and decreases from 1 ( for @xmath56 ) to 6/7 ( for @xmath57 ) , and the associated magnetic moment changes from 2.54  @xmath25 to 2.35  @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "thus , the system exhibits features characteristic of localized magnetism , and is a good approximation of the curie ",
    "weiss law . in turn , for @xmath58 , a characteristic maximum in @xmath40 develops with increasing @xmath59 , yet the curie ",
    "weiss behaviour can still be observed at high enough temperatures ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of the alloys ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in seems to nicely follow the predictions of the icf model .",
    "the experimental data can be described at elevated temperatures by modified by adding a constant term @xmath61 , which accounts for possible temperature independent paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions to the total magnetic susceptibility ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. : @xmath62 least squares fittings of to the experimental data [ see the dashed lines in ( a ) and ] yielded @xmath17 decreasing monotonically from @xmath63  k for ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in to @xmath64  k for ce@xmath0ni@xmath0 in ( in agreement with the value of 884  k , reported previously  @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 was found to increase from + 11(1 )  k to 93(4 )  k , respectively , in a non - linear manner with a local maximum of 147(5 )  k for ce@xmath0cu@xmath65ni@xmath66 in . in turn , the temperature independent term was found to be nearly constant in the whole series of the alloys and equal to @xmath67  emu / mol .    as apparent from (",
    "a ) , at low temperatures the experimental @xmath19 variations measured for strongly intermediate valent alloys significantly deviate from the predictions of the icf model ( note curie - like tails @xmath68 ) .",
    "such a behaviour is often observed in the intermediate valence systems and can be ascribed to the presence of paramagnetic impurities ( cf .",
    "while in the localized regime the latter contribution is negligible , in the intermediate valence state ( exhibiting relatively weak magnetism ) it becomes significant and thus strongly modifies the expected icf curvature of @xmath19 .",
    "the change of @xmath17 with increasing the nickel content ( ) is in line with the observed evolution of the magnetic properties of the system ce@xmath0cu@xmath69ni@xmath70 in .",
    "one should note however , that the icf model does not take into account i.a .",
    "the crystal electric field effect and magnetic correlations , which are also expected to play some role in the alloys studied ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", the derived absolute values of @xmath17 can differ from the actual energy difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 configurations , especially in the localized regime .",
    "\\(b ) displays the temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath40 for the alloys with @xmath71 , which exhibit well localized magnetic moments . clearly , the compound ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in orders antiferromagnetically at the nel temperature @xmath9  =  5.5  k , in agreement with the previous finding  @xcite . with increasing @xmath15 , @xmath9 [ defined as a maximum on the @xmath40 curve ] rapidly decreases .",
    "for @xmath72 , hardly any anomaly is visible in @xmath40 , at least in the temperature range studied .",
    "extrapolation of the dependence @xmath73 to the absolute zero temperature ( see the dashed line in ) yields the critical concentration @xmath74 of about 0.4 . in parallel with the suppression of @xmath9",
    ", one observes gradual broadening of the maximum in @xmath40 that manifests the antiferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "this finding suggests that the quantum critical phase transition smears out and hence no quantum critical state could be reached , as concluded also e.g. in cepd@xmath69rh@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the temperature variations of the electrical resistivity of ce@xmath0cu@xmath69ni@xmath70 in and the nonmagnetic reference la@xmath0cu@xmath0 in ( normalized to room temperature values ) are presented in .",
    "while the @xmath75 curve obtained for the la sample is characteristic of simple metals , the resistivity of the parent compound ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in exhibits features of a magnetically ordered dense kondo system .",
    "in the paramagnetic region , @xmath75 forms a broad hump at about 100  k and exhibits a negative logarithmic slope below about 20  k , both manifesting the kondo scattering of conduction electrons on crystalline electric field @xmath10 sublevels ( cf .",
    "a drop of the resistivity at about 6  k results from the antiferromagnetic phase transition . for the alloys with @xmath76 , the magnetic phase transition could not be evidenced because of the temperature limit of our resistivity measurements ( @xmath77  k ) . with increasing the nickel content",
    ", the low temperature @xmath78 contribution becomes dominant and for @xmath79 it entirely merges with the hump at elevated temperatures . over an extended temperature range @xmath75 of this alloy",
    "exhibits a single nearly logarithmic slope [ ( a ) ] . for higher @xmath15",
    ", the low temperature resistivity evolves into a @xmath80 dependence [ see dashed curve in ( b ) ] , that signals the intermediate valence behaviour .    in order to shed more light on the observed evolution of @xmath81 of the alloys ce@xmath0cu@xmath69ni@xmath70 in with @xmath82",
    ", we derived the magnetic contribution @xmath83 to their total resistivity by subtracting the phonon contribution to @xmath75 of la@xmath0cu@xmath0 in ( cf .",
    "the @xmath84 curve obtained for ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in revealed that the hump in @xmath81 results from the presence of a distinct maximum in @xmath83 followed by another @xmath78 dependence at high temperatures [ ( a ) ] .",
    "moreover , two logarithmic slopes are visible also in the other cu - rich alloys , in which the maximum at 100  k is somewhat obscured by the low temperature @xmath78 dependence .    according to the cornut  coqblin model  @xcite , in the localized regime with the magnetic ground state the interplay of the kondo effect and the crystalline electric field ( cef ) results in the magnetic contribution to the total resistivity , which can be expressed as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 denotes the effective degeneracy of the @xmath3 state , @xmath88 is the negative exchange integral , @xmath89 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath90 is the effective cutoff parameter , and @xmath6 is a constant . in the case of ce@xmath8 ions experiencing a tetragonal crystal electric field potential ,",
    "the sixfold degenerated @xmath3 multiplet splits into three doublets located at the energies @xmath91 .",
    "population of these levels depends on the temperature , so the effective degeneracy of the @xmath3 state increases with increasing @xmath92 from @xmath93  =  2 ( ground doublet ) at absolute zero temperature , to @xmath94  =  4 ( pseudoquartet ) at elevated @xmath92 , to @xmath95  =  6 ( pseudosextet ) at high temperatures . from",
    "it becomes clear that the slope and the magnitude of @xmath96 depend on @xmath87 , so for well separated doublets one can observe up to three @xmath78 slopes in the magnetic contribution to the resistivity .",
    "however , from the point of view of the present study , it is more important to note that the relative magnitudes of the particular @xmath96 contributions [ equation ] may vary also with @xmath97 , making the observation of the separated kondo slopes difficult ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming boltzman - like thermal excitations of the crystalline electric field doublets ( in line with the cornut ",
    "coqblin approach  @xcite ) , the kondo contribution @xmath98 to the electrical resistivity can be expressed as : @xmath99 note , that the contributions @xmath100 and @xmath101 include already @xmath102 and @xmath100 , respectively . in order to avoid their multiplication , two corrections , i.e. @xmath103 and @xmath104 , were added . in order to check the influence of magnetic exchange on the overall character of @xmath105",
    ", we made a few simulations using a fixed crystal electric field scheme ( 2:2:2 with @xmath106  =  0  k , @xmath107  =  50  k , and @xmath107  =  100  k ) and varying the arbitrary chosen value of @xmath97 .",
    "for simplicity , the constants @xmath6 , @xmath89 , and @xmath108 were assumed to be independent of @xmath97 and equal to 1 .",
    "( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) display the results of these calculations .    as shown in ( b ) , for low absolute values of @xmath97 the magnitude of the ground doublet contribution @xmath102 is much less than the pseudo - quartet ( @xmath100 ) and pseudo - sextet ( @xmath101 ) contributions . as a consequence , the crossover between the crystal field levels manifests itself as a distinct maximum in @xmath105 . upon increasing @xmath109 ,",
    "@xmath102 increases and becomes of the same order of magnitude as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and the maximum in @xmath105 becomes less pronounced [ ( c ) ] . finally , for large @xmath110",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath102 is higher than @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so the crossover between the logarithmic slopes in @xmath105 is monotonic [ ( d ) ] .",
    "although any quantitative analysis of the resistivity data in terms of is hampered by polycrystalline nature of the specimens studied ( effects of magnetocrystalline anisotropy , inter - grains resistance , possible internal cracks , etc . ) , it is worth emphasizing the qualitative similarity of the experimental [ ( a ) ] and model curves [ ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "their evolution with increasing the ni content can thus be attributed to the increase in the strength of the hybridization , as it has been done for the magnetic susceptibility data .",
    "the partial substitution of cu by ni in the antiferromagnetically ordered compound ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in results in a monotonic compression of its unit cell ( up to 10% ) , accompanied by a drastic change of the physical properties of the system . in particular , the magnetic measurements of ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in revealed continuous evolution from the localised magnetic moments regime for @xmath111 to the fluctuating valence state for @xmath112 .",
    "the detailed analysis of the inverse magnetic susceptibility data within the icf model yielded reversal of the order of the magnetic @xmath3 and nonmagnetic @xmath4 levels in the alloys with @xmath113 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath3 level , being the ground state in the cu - rich alloys and lying _ below _ the fermi level ( equivalent to the @xmath4 configuration ) , becomes an excited state in the ni - rich alloys , lying _ above _ the fermi level .",
    "deeply in the localized regime , the ce magnetic moments order antiferromagnetically , and the nel temperature decreases quasi - linearly with increasing the nickel content from 5.5  k in ce@xmath0cu@xmath0 in down to 2.7  k in ce@xmath0cu@xmath114ni@xmath115 in .",
    "simultaneous significant broadening of the maximum in @xmath40 at @xmath9 indicates possible smearing of the phase transition at temperatures approaching the absolute zero .",
    "the analysis of the temperature dependencies of the electrical resistivity of the ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in series revealed an evolution of the system from the dense kondo lattice regime towards the nonmagnetic metal regime , controlled mainly by the increase in the exchange integral .",
    "all the presented findings are in line with the doniach picture of kondo systems , which predicts a change in the character of the ground state from long range magnetic order to intermediate valence .",
    "this transformation is induced by an increase in the value of the exchange integral @xmath97 that measures the hybridization strength .",
    "for ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in , the increase of @xmath88 with increasing @xmath15 is likely a consequence of the observed compression of the unit cell volume .",
    "simultaneous reduction in a number of the @xmath116 electrons , which could probably lead to some decrease in @xmath97 , seems to have less significant influence on the physical properties of the system . to verify our hypothesis detailed spectroscopic studies of the ce@xmath0cu@xmath1ni@xmath2 in series are indispensable .",
