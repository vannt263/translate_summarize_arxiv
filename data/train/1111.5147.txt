    "the recently reported higher primordial abundance of @xmath9he @xcite and the larger number of effective number of neutrinos by observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite might be a motivation for large neutrino chemical potentials or equivalently large neutrino asymmetries .",
    "charge conservation and neutrality ensures that the asymmetry in the charged leptons is of the same order as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "but due to the difficulties in detecting neutrinos one can only obtain constraints on the lepton ( flavour ) asymmetry from indirect observations .",
    "a large @xmath1 would affect big bang nucleosythesis ( bbn ) in two ways .",
    "it changes the primordial @xmath9he abundance @xcite and the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "we show in this article some results on how large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetries influence the early universe between the electroweak phase transition and the onset of neutrino oscillations . for a more detailed discussion see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "before bbn , at @xmath11 few mev , neutrino flavour starts to oscillate and equilibrates any initial flavour asymmetries before the onset of bbn @xcite . for temperatures larger then @xmath12 lepton flavour number is conserved . within the standard model , no violation of baryon and lepton number",
    "are possible after the electroweak phase transition at @xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "a lepton flavour asymmetry @xmath1 remains constant in the early universe between @xmath14 and @xmath12 .",
    "here we assume @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "all particle interactions between these two events are in statistical equilibrium and can be described by the set of 5 equations : @xmath16 the net particle density of a species @xmath17 with mass @xmath18 and chemical potential @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 with the internal degrees of freedom of a species @xmath21 .",
    "anti - particles @xmath22 have the same chemical potential as the corresponding particle , but inverted sign : @xmath23 . with the observed baryon asymmetry and the charge neutrality of the universe we can solve equations ( [ lf ] ) to ( [ charge ] ) for different @xmath1 for all standard model particles in statistical equilibrium , leaving @xmath19 as free parameters .    with each conserved quantum number",
    "one can associate a chemical potential which can be calculated from the free energy of the particle plasma .",
    "apart from the three lepton chemical potentials and the charge chemical potential we can also calculate the baryon chemical potential @xmath24 .",
    "the latter one is for cosmologist and particle physicist of greater interest to describe the qcd transition , the confinement of quarks to hadrons .",
    "it is still an open question , if the cosmic qcd transition is just a rapid change or a real phase transition .",
    "one would like to have deeper knowledge of the order of the transition , since it sets the initial conditions for bbn and the different orders would lead to different observable consequences , like a modification of the primordial garavitational background or quark nuggets @xcite . for the description of the transition in the ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) phase diagram , we found that the order of @xmath24 is set for large lepton asymmetries by @xmath26 . assuming all particles massless and @xmath27 we find for lepton asymmetries @xmath28 the approximate solution @xmath29 .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath24 including all standard model particles at all temperatures with their physical masses are shown in figure [ fig : qcd ] .",
    "we find that sign and size of the lepton asymmetry plays an important role for the description of the cosmic qcd transition in the ( @xmath24@xmath25)-plane . for large asymmetries @xmath30 the trajectories are pushed in the vicinity of a possible first order transition , predicted by results from lattice simulations and perturbatve calculation of qcd combined with results from heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it is a good approximation to describe the early universe and even the phase transitions as equilibrium processes @xcite , but for a more concrete statement at @xmath31 we would have to incorporate the strong interaction .",
    "-t trajectory on sign and size of a lepton asymmetry , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] -t trajectory on sign and size of a lepton asymmetry , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to describe the cosmic qcd transition in a universe with baryon , lepton flavour and charge conservation , a two dimensional ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) phase diagram is not sufficient .",
    "more realistic is a five dimensional phase diagram ( @xmath32 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) for a charge neutral and homogeneous universe . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "large chemical potentials influence also the energy density and therefore the hubble rate @xmath33 , with newtons constant @xmath34 and the energy density of all particle species ( particle and antiparticle ) @xmath35 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath36 describes the boson or fermion distribution for a particle @xmath17 .",
    "this influences another major event of cosmology : the freeze out of the best motivated dark matter candidate , the wimp @xcite with a typical mass of @xmath37 gev @xmath38 tev .",
    "it decouples statistically from the standard model particles(few mev ) . ] at @xmath39 , when its annihilation rate drops below the hubble rate .",
    "the number density remains constant @xmath40 and thus the relative relic abundance @xmath41 is observable today .",
    "the number density follows the boltzman equation @xmath42 with the thermal average of the cross section , which can be approximated as @xmath43 .",
    "the numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 describe s- and p - wave annihilation and @xmath46 , for more details see e.g.  @xcite . increasing the energy density via large chemical potentials changes the hubble rate and thus the temperature , where the freeze out happens .",
    "we illustrate this effect by the change of the helicity degrees of freedom in the energy density @xmath47 and in the entropy @xmath48\\frac{{\\rm d}^3p}{(2\\pi)^3}}$ ] , where upper and lower signs refer to bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "the present relative relic abundance becomes then @xmath49 .",
    "as long as the deviation @xmath50 is much smaller than the standard @xmath51 we can approximate @xmath52 with @xmath53 depending on the s- or p - wave annihilation channel domination . for the numerical analysis",
    "we assume the governing effect in helicity degrees of freedom and neglect the effect in @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to : @xmath55_{x_{\\rm{fo}}}\\ ] ] a numerical analysis with all physical particle masses and not restricted to small chemical potentials is shown in figure [ fig : deltamulf ] for different lepton asymmetries @xmath56 .",
    "we show the ratio @xmath57 as a function of lepton flavour asymmetry @xmath1 and observe an effect of order 1 @xmath58 for @xmath59 and of almost @xmath60 for @xmath61 .     and",
    "large asymmetries @xmath62 .",
    "we observe for @xmath61 an effect of 20 percent .",
    "the full numerical solutions include all standard model particles.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this article we have shown that large lepton asymmetries do have an impact on the evolution of the early universe .",
    "we focused on the cosmic qcd transition and the wimp freeze out .",
    "we have shown that @xmath63 can significantly influence the dynamics of the qcd phase transition and maybe trigger even the order of the transition in the @xmath64-plane . however",
    ", a sufficient description of the cosmic qcd transition needs at least 5 dimensions ( @xmath1 , @xmath45,t , @xmath65 ) and even more for an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "we have further shown that large lepton flavour asymmetries can decrease the relative relic abundance of wimp dark matter for a given cross section .",
    "for symmetric flavour asymmetries @xmath66 and @xmath67 we found a few percent effect on the relic wimp abundance .",
    "this might allow for smaller cross sections for a wimp candidate to match the observed dark matter abundance .",
