    "we assume infection by either disease confers immediate and complete protection from any future infection by any disease .",
    "we index the diseases by @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "individuals infected by disease @xmath98 transmit to their partners at rate @xmath99 , and recover at rate @xmath100 .",
    "we assume that at the initial time @xmath10 enough individuals are infected that the disease spreads deterministically ( at the aggregated population - level ) , and that the probability an individual of degree @xmath15 is initially infected is @xmath14 .",
    "we must make an assumption about which individuals are initially infected .",
    "namely , if we consider an initially susceptible individual @xmath7 , no information we have about @xmath7 at time @xmath10 tells us anything about the status of its partners .",
    "this assumption is satisfied if we initially infect a random subset of the population , or even if the disease has been spreading for some time before @xmath10 .",
    "this assumption is violated if we select high - degree individuals and preferentially infect their partners .        whether a given individual @xmath7 is infected at any given time is a random variable .",
    "however , if we make the assumption that the disease spreads deterministically at the aggregated population - level , then whether or not a given individual is infected at any given time can not have any impact on the aggregated scale .",
    "if it did , there would be stochastic effects visible at the population scale .",
    "this observation allows us to decouple the status of @xmath7 from the dynamics of the epidemic in the sense that we can ignore any feedback from @xmath7 on the epidemic . to make this mathematically rigorous",
    ", we simply allow @xmath7 to become infected and for its infection to proceed as normal , but we disallow any transmission from @xmath7 to its partners .",
    "this keeps the status of partners of @xmath7 independent .    the probability that @xmath7 is susceptible equals the probability that none of its partners has transmitted to it ( under the assumption @xmath7 does not transmit to its partners ) . to calculate the proportion of the population that is susceptible , infected , or recovered , we assume that @xmath7 is randomly selected from the population and prevented from infecting its partners .",
    "we call @xmath7 a _ test individual_. the probability @xmath7 has a given status equals the proportion of the population that has that status .",
    "we define @xmath11 to be the probability that a random neighbor of @xmath7 which had not transmitted to @xmath7 by time @xmath8 still has not transmitted by time @xmath12 . then if @xmath7 has degree @xmath15 , the probability it was initially susceptible is @xmath14 , and the probability it is still susceptible is @xmath101 .",
    "averaging over all possible values of @xmath15 , we have @xmath102 the value of @xmath27 reduces over time as infections occur .",
    "mathematically this appears as a reduction in @xmath20 .",
    "we must calculate how quickly @xmath20 changes , and how much of that change is due to each disease .",
    "this will allow us to calculate how much of the reduction in @xmath27 should go into each disease s infected class .",
    "we now look for the change in @xmath20 .",
    "we define @xmath9 to be a random neighbor of @xmath7 which had not transmitted to @xmath7 by @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath20 is the probability @xmath9 has not transmitted to @xmath7 by time @xmath12 . as our initial condition , we have @xmath103 .",
    "we divide @xmath20 into four compartments .",
    "we take @xmath26 to be the probability that @xmath9 is still susceptible , @xmath78 the probability @xmath9 is infected with disease @xmath2 but has not transmitted to @xmath7 , @xmath77 the probability @xmath9 is infected with disease @xmath0 but has not transmitted to @xmath7 , and @xmath24 the probability that @xmath9 is recovered ( from either disease ) and did not transmit during infection .",
    "these add up to @xmath20 : @xmath104 .",
    "the probability that @xmath9 has transmitted to @xmath7 is @xmath105 .",
    "the flow between these compartments is shown in figure  [ fig : theta ] .    at ( 0,0 ) ( phis ) @xmath106 ; at ( 3,1.5 ) ( phii1 ) @xmath78 ; at ( 3,-1.5 ) ( phii2 ) @xmath77 ; at ( 6,1.5 ) ( phir ) @xmath24 ; at ( 6,-1.5 ) ( 1mt ) @xmath105 ; ( phis.0 ) edge node @xmath107   ( phii1.180 ) ; ( phis.0 ) edge node @xmath108   ( phii2.180 ) ; ( phii2 ) edge node @xmath109 ( 1mt ) ; ( phii1 ) edge node @xmath110 ( phir ) ; ( phii1.340 ) edge node @xmath111 ( 1mt.90 ) ; ( phii2.20 ) edge node @xmath112 ( phir.270 ) ;    we first find the rate of change of @xmath20 .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to see that @xmath113 this is because the only path for @xmath20 to decrease is through @xmath9 transmitting to @xmath7 , which requires that @xmath9 be infected ( and not yet transmitted to @xmath7 ) .    at @xmath10",
    ", we have @xmath114 is the probability a random neighbor of @xmath7 is still susceptible ( given that it has not transmitted to @xmath7 ) .",
    "we take this as an input value .",
    "the value of @xmath78 , @xmath77 , and @xmath24 are similarly all input from the conditions at @xmath10 .",
    "we can explicitly calculate the value of @xmath26 at later times , if we know @xmath20 . to do this",
    ", we find the probability distribution for degree of @xmath9 , and then calculate the probability that no neighbor of @xmath9 has transmitted to @xmath9 .    at time @xmath10 , the edge joining @xmath7 to @xmath9 is simply an edge from @xmath7 to a random neighbor that is susceptible .",
    "the probability that edge connects to a degree @xmath15 individual is proportional to the number of edges that all susceptible individuals of degree @xmath15 have , @xmath115 .",
    "the normalization factor is the total number of all edges of susceptible individuals , @xmath116 .",
    "the probability that @xmath9 is still susceptible at time @xmath12 is @xmath117 .",
    "so the probability of having a degree @xmath15 susceptible neighbor at time @xmath12 is @xmath118 .",
    "summing over all possible @xmath15 , and cancelling @xmath30 , we arrive at @xmath119 . so given that @xmath9 is initially susceptible , the probability that @xmath9 is susceptible at a later time @xmath12 is @xmath120 .",
    "since the probability @xmath9 is initially susceptible is @xmath114 , we conclude @xmath121 the rate of change of @xmath26 is simply @xmath122 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the amount that goes from @xmath26 to @xmath78 is @xmath123 and the amount going into @xmath77 is @xmath124 .",
    "so in figure  [ fig : theta ] , we have expressions for the flux along each edge except the edges into @xmath24 .",
    "these edges are straightforward , because the recovery rate for disease @xmath2 is @xmath4 and the recovery rate for disease @xmath0 is @xmath6 .",
    "so the total flux from @xmath78 to @xmath24 is @xmath110 and the flux from @xmath77 is @xmath125 .    using the flows in figure  [ fig : theta ]",
    ", we can arrive at a coupled system for @xmath20 , @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "it is @xmath126 with @xmath103 and @xmath114 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 given by the initial state of the population .",
    "these equations govern the spread of the disease through the network . however , they are not the usual variables of interest",
    ". typically we want to know the proportion susceptible , infected , or recovered .",
    "figure  [ fig : s ] shows a flow diagram governing the proportion of the population in each state .",
    "we can use this to recover @xmath27 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath87 . as we noted above , @xmath129 .",
    "the flux into @xmath16 can be calculated to be @xmath130 , and the flux into @xmath17 is @xmath131 .",
    "the fluxes from each of these into the recovered states are @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we distinguish the two recovered states because we will frequently be interested in the total proportion infected by each disease .",
    "we could have similarly subdivided @xmath24 into two compartments , but it would not provide any information that is useful here .    at ( 0,0 ) ( s ) @xmath134 ; at ( 3,1.5 ) ( i1 ) @xmath16 ; at ( 3,-1.5 ) ( i2 ) @xmath17 ; at ( 6,1.5 ) ( r1 ) @xmath18 ; at ( 6,-1.5 ) ( r2 ) @xmath87 ; ( s.0 ) edge node@xmath135 ( i1.180 ) ; ( s.0 ) edge node@xmath131 ( i2.180 ) ; ( i1 ) edge node@xmath136 ( r1 ) ; ( i2 ) edge node@xmath133 ( r2 ) ;        there are several regimes that can be identified .",
    "when the cumulative number of infections is small enough that @xmath27 and @xmath26 are approximately @xmath2 , then we can neglect nonlinear terms .",
    "which regime is observed is determined by the relative sizes of the two epidemics when the linear approximation breaks down .",
    "we focus our attention on regimes for which the linear approximation is valid at the initial time .",
    "when the initial condition is small , the linear terms dominate and the epidemics grow ( or decay ) exponentially .",
    "the equations governing the epidemics are uncoupled in this regime .",
    "physically , this means that competition for nodes is so weak that it can be neglected .",
    "in fact a stronger statement is true : in addition to not having inter - disease competition , there is no intra - disease competition : a transmission path is very unlikely to encounter a node infected along another transmission path .",
    "assume that the exponential growth rates of the two diseases are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath138 .",
    "this continues until one of them becomes large enough that competition begins to appear . at this point",
    "the growth of both epidemics starts to slow .",
    "if the difference in epidemic sizes is large enough at this point , then this first epidemic will not be slowed by the much smaller other epidemic .",
    "the dynamics will proceed as if there were just one disease spreading .",
    "eventually the susceptible population will decrease , the disease will peak and eventually decay away , all with the second disease negligible .",
    "once this decay has occurred , there will be a `` residual '' network",
    ". the second disease will continue to spread along this network .",
    "if the residual network is well - enough connected ( and the second disease sufficiently infectious ) , the second disease can continue to grow , and then it experiences its own epidemic .",
    "if the diseases are close enough in size when nonlinear terms become important , then both diseases contribute a non - negligible amount to reduction in @xmath27 and @xmath26 at the same time .",
    "thus they interact dynamically .",
    "each disease contributes in a non - negligible way to hindering the spread of the other . to determine whether this can happen",
    ", we use a simple balance based on the initial sizes and the early growth rates .",
    "typically we might expect that one disease becomes large while the other is still exponentially small .",
    "if one disease is sufficiently small when the other disease becomes large , then the larger disease will spread and cause an epidemic that is effectively the same size as it would be in the absence of the smaller disease . using the initial sizes and growth rates , it is straightforward to calculate the sizes of the two diseases once nonlinearities begin to be significant .",
    "for the two diseases to not interact , the `` smaller '' disease must remain negligibly small until the `` larger '' disease has finished its epidemic .",
    "we derive slightly different thresholds for the case where the smaller disease is the fast - growing disease or the slow - growing disease . to derive the threshold condition",
    ", we make a crude assumption that the two diseases continue spreading according to the linear growth rate . in the non - overlapping regimes ,",
    "the smaller disease must remain small throughout the spread of the larger disease .",
    "we crudely choose to apply our conditions when the exponential growth implies that the larger disease would have reached size @xmath2 .",
    "we look at the size of the smaller disease ( assuming exponential growth ) at this time . for",
    "a given observed size for the smaller disease , we reach different conclusions if it is the fast or the slow growing disease .",
    "if it is the fast - growing disease , and we observe @xmath139 , then that means that at previous times it was much smaller , and so we would not expect to observe any impact . on the other hand if it is the slower - growing disease , and we observe @xmath139 , that means for much of the spread of the larger disease it was at about that size , and so we would expect to observe some impact .",
    "so if the fast - growing disease is the small disease , we allow it to be as large as @xmath139 when the slow disease would reach @xmath2 . if the slow - growing disease is the small disease , we require that it be much smaller , choosing @xmath140 instead . our choice of threshold is somewhat arbitrary , and influenced by the fact that @xmath141 giving a simple expression for our thresholds . taking this",
    ", we can derive the @xmath142 and @xmath143 thresholds in the text .",
    "taking @xmath56 and @xmath57 to be the proportions initially infected with each disease ( at random ) .",
    "so long as @xmath144 is not between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , then the two diseases will not interact dynamically .",
    "one disease will become large and run through its entire epidemic prior to the other disease ( possibly ) having its own epidemic .",
    "this defines the `` non - overlapping '' epidemic regimes .",
    "if @xmath147 lies within this range , then we have the overlapping epidemic regime .      at ( 0,0 ) ( phis ) @xmath106 ; at ( 3,1.5 ) ( phid ) @xmath148 ; at ( 3,-1.5 ) ( phib ) @xmath149 ; at ( 6,1.5 ) ( phir ) @xmath24 ; at ( 6,-1.5 ) ( 1mt ) @xmath105 ; ( phis.0 ) edge node @xmath150 ( phid.180 ) ; ( phis.0 ) edge node @xmath151 ( phib.180 ) ; ( phid.340 ) edge node @xmath152 ( 1mt.90 ) ; ( phib ) edge node @xmath153 ( 1mt ) ; ( phid ) edge node @xmath154 ( phir ) ;        we now consider the spread of a single disese through a network , which can be prevented with a behavior change .",
    "we assume that the behavior change gives complete protection from infection .",
    "once an individual has adopted the behavior change , the change is permanent .",
    "an individual who has changed behavior will transmit that behavior change to partners .",
    "the disease transmits at rate @xmath93 and recovery occurs at rate @xmath159 .",
    "contact with an infected individual causes behavior change at rate @xmath94 .",
    "contact with an individual whose behavior has changed causes behavior change at rate @xmath95 .",
    "the flow diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : behave ] .",
    "the resulting equations are @xmath160 the early growth of @xmath148 is exponential with rate @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath94 is sufficiently large , the infection decays .",
    "this corresponds to a balance between transmitting disease prior to either recovering or transmitting behavior change . when the transmission probability is small enough a typical infected individual causes fewer than @xmath2 new infection and",
    "the disease must die out .",
    "changing @xmath95 does not alter the early growth rate of the disease .",
    "so we might anticipate that the disease will be able to cause a large scale epidemic .",
    "however , if @xmath162 , the behavior change itself also leads to an `` epidemic '' .",
    "if the behavior growth rate is sufficiently large , its `` epidemic '' occurs while the disease epidemic is still exponentially small . in this limit",
    ", the behavior change will dominate the populaion , and the disease remains exponentially small .",
    "we do not see the complementary case in which the disease becomes large while the behavior change is exponentially small , because as disease incidence increases it directly induces behavior changes .",
    "so either the behavior change has its `` epidemic '' first , or the two have overlapping `` epidemics '' ."

    "<S> . if @xmath57 is @xmath64 and @xmath56 small , or if @xmath56 is @xmath64 and @xmath57 small , the disease with the large initial condition spreads and effectively infects everyone simply because a large fraction is initially infected . </S>",
    "<S> the other disease can not spread in the `` residual network '' left behind . if neither @xmath56 or @xmath57 is initially large , other regimes are seen . to analyze them </S>",
    "<S> , we first note that when both diseases are small , they grow at exponential rates @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    in the `` overlapping epidemic '' regime , </S>",
    "<S> the slower - growing disease @xmath0 begins with a head start . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the head start scales so that the two epidemics become large at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath67 is constant during the linear growth phase . for given @xmath68 , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is universal . </S>",
    "<S> the diseases grow independently until the linear growth phase ends . </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate bounds on the regime by crudely assuming exponential growth continues forever . </S>",
    "<S> there is some value of @xmath69 that corresponds to @xmath70 and @xmath71 which means that the slower growing disease would affect less than one percent of the population by the time the faster growing disease has fully established itself in this approximation . </S>",
    "<S> similarly we take some @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which means that the slower growing disease will have fully burned through the population when the faster growing disease is only affecting 5% of the population in this approximation . for @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 becomes large well before @xmath17 . for @xmath76 , @xmath17 becomes large well before @xmath16 . between these values , </S>",
    "<S> the epidemics become large at similar times and interact dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> further discussion of these boundaries is in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two``non - overlapping epidemic '' regimes . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath75 , disease @xmath2 becomes large and has an epidemic while disease @xmath0 is still exponentially small . if @xmath76 , disease @xmath0 has an epidemic while disease @xmath2 is still exponentially small . </S>",
    "<S> once one epidemic has finished , it may be possible for the remaining disease to spread in the residual network . </S>",
    "<S> we can derive the threshold condition : for simplicity we assume disease @xmath2 spreads first . </S>",
    "<S> while it spreads , @xmath77 remains negligible . by looking at the relative fluxes out of @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that after disease @xmath2 has completed its spread but before disease @xmath0 is significant , @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> we can assume @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath78 and @xmath77 are effectively zero , we conclude @xmath82 , yielding @xmath83 then @xmath84 . for disease @xmath0 to spread , we require @xmath85 , which implies @xmath86 where @xmath20 comes from the above equation . </S>",
    "<S> a similar calculation would lead to a final size for @xmath87 , so in this case we can calculate the final outcomes of the epidemics without calculating the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the threshold we have found requires that @xmath88 be greater than @xmath89 by a nonzero amount . </S>",
    "<S> it is not enough for the second disease s transmission probability to simply be larger than the first , it must be well above that of the first . </S>",
    "<S> this is because even once disease @xmath2 peaks and begins to decrease , @xmath20 will continue to decrease further , so disease @xmath0 encounters a population that is well below the threshold for disease @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold condition for disease @xmath0 to invade has been identified previously : @xcite derived it under the assumption of a second disease introduced after the first disease had spread , and @xcite derived it in the special case that the system was in the non - overlapping epidemic regime for which the faster growing disease would `` win . ''    </S>",
    "<S> thus our analysis shows that if two diseases are introduced at small levels into the network , then the possible regimes can be understood by looking at the exponential growth rates @xmath90 and @xmath91 of the diseases . without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> , we can assume @xmath92 , the first disease grows faster . if disease @xmath0 has a sufficiently large head start , there will be a `` non - overlapping epidemic '' regime : the population will experience an epidemic of disease @xmath0 unaffected by disease @xmath2 . if the infectiousness of disease @xmath2 is large enough it will cause its own epidemic after disease @xmath0 has finished </S>",
    "<S> . we can calculate the final size of each epidemic without requiring the full dynamic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> if we take a smaller head start for disease @xmath0 , there is an overlapping epidemic regime in which the two diseases produce interacting epidemics . to calculate the dynamics of these epidemics </S>",
    "<S> , we require the dynamic equations  . the possible final sizes depend on the details of the interactions , and there appears to be no simple expression for the final size . </S>",
    "<S> if the head start for disease @xmath0 shrinks further , we enter another non - overlapping epidemic regime in which disease @xmath2 has the first epidemic . </S>",
    "<S> again , it is possible for disease @xmath0 to later have an epidemic if its transmission probability is sufficiently larger than that of disease @xmath2 . at most one of the non - overlapping epidemic regimes </S>",
    "<S> can have epidemics for both diseases .    </S>",

    "<S> we assume contact with an infected individual transmits infection at rate @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we allow that if @xmath7 is in contact with an infected individual , then at rate @xmath94 @xmath7 changes its behavior </S>",
    "<S> . if @xmath7 is in contact with an individual who has changed behavior then @xmath7 changes behavior at rate @xmath95 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : behave ] , we show how behavior change modifies epidemic outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> if the disease is introduced in a small number of individuals and behavior change spreads sufficiently faster than the disease , then the behavior change prevents the disease from having a large - scale epidemic .    . </S>",
    "<S> the disease spreads with @xmath96 ,  @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath95 and @xmath94 are varied . for the initial condition , </S>",
