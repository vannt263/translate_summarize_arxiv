    "the characteristics of the galaxy populations in the cores of rich clusters appear to vary strongly as a function of redshift , with an increasing fraction of blue galaxies in clusters at @xmath3 ( the butcher - oemler effect , butcher & oemler 1984 ) .",
    "the search for the processes responsible for these rapid changes has become a vigorous field of research and at least for the blue cluster galaxies a broad concensus has been reached about the nature of this population .",
    "the bulk are star - forming cluster members , they cover a wide range of luminosities , from a few @xmath4 downwards , and have emission line strengths which indicate moderate to high star formation rates ( abraham et al .",

    "these studies have shown that most of the blue star - forming galaxies have strong disk components and a large fraction also appear to be disturbed , with structures suggesting mergers or tidal interactions .",
    "thus the increasing proportion of blue galaxies within distant clusters is associated with an increasing number of actively star - forming disk galaxies in these environments .",
    "the large fraction of apparently disturbed galaxies suggests that galaxy - galaxy interactions or the effects of the cluster tidal field on these disk galaxies could be responsible for the butcher - oemler effect ( moore , lake & katz 1998 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic studies of distant clusters uncovered another population of luminous galaxies which is not seen in similar numbers in local clusters .",
    "these are galaxies with strong balmer absorption ( typically measured using the h@xmath5@xmath64104  line and coming predominantly from a stars ) and no [ oii]@xmath63727  emission .",
    "the large population of a stars is a sign that the galaxy was actively forming massive stars in the recent past ( @xmath7gyr ) , while the lack of emission lines suggests that this star formation has now ceased .",
    "together the spectral properties are interpreted as showing that the galaxy is in a post - starburst phase .",
    "almost 20% of the luminous galaxies within the cores of distant clusters fall in this post - starburst class ( e.g.  d99 , although see balogh et al .",
    "1999 ) and it has been suggested that this high fraction indicates that almost all cluster galaxies pass through this phase ( barger et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "there is an increasing realisation in the community of the importance of dust obscuration in defining the apparent properties of galaxies in the near - uv and optical , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "this issue has been highlighted by the disagreement over the form of the star formation history of the universe as estimated from the variation in the ultraviolet luminosity density with redshift ( e.g.  lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) compared to star formation indicators at longer wavelengths such as h@xmath8 emission ( yan et al .",
    "1999 ) or reradiated star light detected in the sub - millimeter ( e.g.  blain et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the longer wavelength tracers tend to find higher star formation densities , a result which has been attributed to dust absorption in the uv and optical ( calzetti & heckman 1999 ; meurer et al .  1997 ;",
    "pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the issue of the effects of dust on the evolutionary cycle associated with the optical butcher - oemler effect has been disregarded by most investigations to date .",
    "however , the recent analysis of the spectral catalog for the morphs sample ( d99 ) by poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 , p99 ) has uncovered evidence for dust obscuration in at least one spectral class  e(a ) galaxies .",
    "these galaxies have detectable [ oii ] emission and relatively strong balmer absorption ( ew(h@xmath9 ) .",
    "these spectral features , along with other properties of the galaxies and of similar spectrally - classified local systems ( p99 ; poggianti & wu 1999 ) , were interpreted by p99 as probably arising from a dust - obscured starburst , with the [ oii ] line strength suppressed by dust absorption . the e(a ) class is naturally identified as the progenitor of the large population of post - starburst galaxies in the clusters .    to obtain a complete view of the star formation properties of cluster galaxies free from the effects of dust obscuration we need to complement the optical studies with observations at longer wavelengths , from the near - infrared to the sub - mm and radio . in particular , observations in the sub - mm and far - infrared can trace the amount of star light absorbed by dust and reradiated at longer wavelengths .",
    "for the most extreme starburst galaxies in the local universe this reradiated emission dominates the bolometric luminosity of the galaxies ( e.g.  sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , current sub - mm and far - infrared surveys lack the sensitivity to study all but the most extreme starburst galaxies ( @xmath10 yr@xmath11 ) at moderate and high redshift .",
    "however , at radio wavelengths , the synchotron radiation from electrons accelerated by supernovae leads to a tight correlation between the radio and far - infrared fluxes of star - forming galaxies across a wide range in luminosity ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "this means that in the absence of a radio - loud active nucleus the radio flux of a star - forming galaxy can be used to estimate its current massive star formation rate .    by employing the huge collecting area of the vla we can undertake a sensitive radio survey for star formation in obscured galaxies down to limits of @xmath12@xmath13 yr@xmath11 at @xmath14 . to this end",
    "the vla has been used in an ambitious survey to determine the evolution of the radio populations in a sample of very - rich clusters out to @xmath15 ( morrison et al .",
    "the survey contains 14 clusters at @xmath160.18 , 12 more between @xmath170.25 and a further four at higher redshifts , @xmath180.41 ( the radio observations discussed in this paper are of the most distant cluster in this survey ) .",
    "morrison et al .  ( 1999 ) find that the population of radio galaxies with luminosities above @xmath19whz@xmath11 in the most extreme clusters has increased by a factor of @xmath206 out to @xmath15 .",
    "they conclude that the radio galaxy population in very rich clusters has evolved significantly over the last 5gyrs .",
    "in this paper we report on high resolution near - infrared imaging from _ hst _ and sensitive radio observations with the vla of a small field in the core of the distant cluster cl0939 + 4713 ( a851 , @xmath0 ) for which high - resolution optical _ hst _ images and extensive archival spectroscopic observations are available .",

    "dewar the wide - field camera  3 ( field - of - view 51.2@xmath25 square , sampling 0.20@xmath25 per pixel ) was not par - focal with the other instruments onboard _ hst _ and to allow the diffraction - limited operation of this camera a special campaign was organised during which the main telescope optics were refocused on the camera  3 focal plane .",
    "the observations comprise a mosaic of four pointings through the f160w filter covering a combined field of around @xmath26 .",
    "each pointing consists of four individual exposures of 1215s , each spatially offset by 1.1@xmath25 on a square grid to remove bad pixels and reduce the effects of flatfield variations .",

    "in particular the claim that the radio to far - infrared correlation varies locally between galaxies in rich clusters and those in the field ( andersen & owen 1995 ) may indicate an environmental influence in the conversion from radio luminosity to star formation rate ( sfr ) resulting from the compression of the galactic magnetic field by the galaxy s motion through the intracluster medium ( icm ) . without a fuller understanding of the state of the icm in distant clusters it is difficult to quantify the extent of this bias on the radio - derived sfrs of distant cluster galaxies .",

    "the dotted lines show the radio flux limit of our sample in cl0939 + 4713 .",
    "we indicate the spectroscopically - confirmed member galaxies which are undetected in the vla map as upper limits .",
    "the association of around 60% of the bright radio - selected sample with spiral galaxies suggests that the evolution in the radio populations within clusters runs in parallel to the increasing fraction of blue star - forming galaxies found in these regions at @xmath97 , the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "the rise in the fraction of bright spiral galaxies in clusters such as cl0939 + 4713 is a factor of @xmath20 out to @xmath15 ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) . even without the increased radio luminosity of the brightest cluster spiral galaxies ,",
    "this increase in the proportion of spirals is enough to explain the evolution in the number of radio sources seen in the distant clusters ( a factor of @xmath986 , morrison et al .",
    "the increase in the spiral fraction in the clusters is believed to result from infall from the surrounding field associated with the growth of the clusters .",
    "a rise in the radio activity of moderate redshift field galaxies has also been observed and attributed to star formation in these galaxies ( georgakakis et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , to fully understand the evolution of the radio population in the cluster we also need to identify the cause of the increased radio luminosities of the bright spiral galaxies .",
    "we note that our use of a local cluster sample in the comparison should minimise the possible environmental effects which could explain this apparent brightening , and moreover the increase in radio luminosities is substantially above that claimed to result from environmental effects within local clusters (  3.1 ) .",
    "we now discuss the internal structure of the cluster galaxies in our _ hst _ images ( fig .  3 and 4 ) and the important insights which our _ nicmos _ near - infrared imaging has provided into the nature of these systems . starting with the early - type galaxies we see relatively uniform optical - near - infrared colors ( as shown by their lack of structure in the f702w@xmath70f160w images in fig .  3 and 4 )",
    "a few contain blue cores , which may be associated with central agn , although the details of these features are sensitive to the exact form of the psf in the f702w and f160w images and so we do not discuss them further here .    a comparison of the f702w and f160w morphologies for the late - type radio sources in fig .",
    "3 shows that in these systems there are substantial differences in the appearence of these galaxies between the restframe @xmath52- and @xmath28-bands .",
    "the near - infrared morphologies are considerably more relaxed and symmetrical .",
    "however , the lack of a morphological classification scheme for local galaxies based on near - infrared imaging means that is not useful to attempt to reclassify the galaxies on the basis of the f160w images .    more interestingly ,",
    "the f702w@xmath70f160w images in fig .  3 show that in a large number of cases the irregular structures seen in the rest - frame @xmath52-band within the central regions of the late - type galaxies are replaced by a much more regular appearence in the near - infrared and so must be due to very red structures ( visible as white regions in fig .  3 ) .",
    "these features are substantially redder than the outskirts of the galaxies ( up to @xmath991.5 ) and could represent differences in the stellar populations within the galaxies or simply dust obscuration . to distinguish between these alternatives we concentrate on the large fraction of galaxies whose integrated spectra show post - starburst stellar populations .",
    "the lack of emission lines in the optical spectra indicates that there is no visible star - formation in the outskirts of these galaxies , which also show the red optical - infrared colors typical of an evolved stellar population ( see the integrated colors in fig .  2 ) .",
    "in this situation it is very difficult to make the stellar population in the central regions of the galaxies substantially redder than the outskirts without invoking a contrived scenario .",
    "in contrast , dust obscuration can easily produce both the apparently red colors and its structured distribution .",
    "we propose therefore that large quantities of dust are probably a common feature of these galaxies .",
    "the small scale features seen in the optical images of these galaxies which we claim are due to dust obscuration have been previously interpreted as arising from dynamical disturbance of these galaxies , suggesting a dynamical origin for their star formation activity ( s97 ) . to understand the consequences of this change in interpretation of these galaxies we focus on those galaxies classified in the optical as showing signs of morphological disturbance by s97 .",
    "there are a total of eight spectroscopically confirmed members in our sample with disturbance indices of @xmath100 indicating abnormally disturbed morphologies , all of these are disk galaxies and they are typically classified as mergers or tidally disturbed , half of them are detected in our radio map .",
    "these galaxies exhibit substantially more regular morphologies in the near - infrared ( figs .  3 & 4 ) ,",
    "in particular the apparently double structures seen in the f702w morphologies of the radio sources # 36 , # 122 and # 536 all disappear in the f160w passband .",
    "we also see signs of dust obscuration in the disturbed galaxies which are not radio sources ( # 171 , # 369 , # 497 and # 622 ) , although arguably not as extreme as the radio - selected sample . in a few cases",
    "there are other signatures of interactions in the f702w images apart from double nuclei , etc , such as low - surface brightness tidal features or companion galaxies ( e.g.  # 224 or # 497 ) , which indicate that these are true merging or interacting systems .",
    "but , in the majority of the galaxies their high disturbance index was based upon the apparent presence of multiple nuclei in the central regions of the galaxies ( see  1 ) .",
    "we suggest that in fact dust obscuration is the correct explanation for their irregular appearence in the restframe @xmath52-band which results in their classification as disturbed or merging .",
    "we estimate that of the eight confirmed members with @xmath100 based on the f702w imaging , at least half ( # 36 , # 122 , # 171 , # 622 ) would have @xmath101 if classified from the f160w images , suggesting that the occurence of highly disturbed galaxies in the core of cl0939 + 4713 may have been overestimated by up to a factor of two .",
    "we conclude from our comparison of the near - infrared and optical morphologies of a small sample of confirmed cluster members that the frequency of galaxies showing small - scale signatures of disturbance or interaction is probably substantially less than has been suggested from optical studies ( e.g.  s97 ) due to obscuration by dust .",
    "this effect acts in addition to the standard luminosity bias in optically - selected samples towards actively star - forming galaxies ( the usual justification given for undertaking near - infrared surveys of distant clusters , e.g.  barger et al .",
    "the expectation of previous optically - based studies was that dust obscuration would not be a significant bias when comparing the distant morphological samples with more local examples as they were comparing effective restframe @xmath52-band observations in both cases ( s97 ) .",
    "however , this expectation seems to have been misleading due to the wider prevelance of dust in cluster galaxies at @xmath102 , perhaps associated with the increased activity in galaxies at these epochs .",
    "looking now at the spectral properties of the radio - selected cluster members we see something striking : five of the galaxies have spectral features which class them as post - starburst ( a+k / k+a ) systems using the scheme of p99 ( table  2 ) .",
    "moreover , these five radio sources show the strongest balmer absorption lines of the eight post - starburst galaxies in our cluster sample ( they are also the brightest five post - starburst galaxies ) .",
    "there are no post - starburst field galaxies in our sample .",
    "the detection of post - starburst galaxies in the radio waveband is surprising .",
    "these galaxies are selected to have no detectable [ oii ] emission and hence are expected to have no on - going massive star formation ( observations of the spectral region including any h@xmath8 emission in these galaxies would make this statement more robust ) .",
    "in contrast , the radio emission is most easily explained as arising from massive star formation ( although some contribution from an obscured radio - loud agn can not be ruled out with our present data ) .",
    "the expected lifetime of the radio emission after the starburst is @xmath103gyr , thus if they are post - starburst systems these galaxies must all be seen _ just _ after the cessation of their star formation .",
    "this seems very unlikely as the length of time in which the post - starburst signature ( strong h@xmath5 absorption ) is visible is @xmath104gyr and we would thus expect to see an order of magnitude more radio - quiet k+a galaxies , where the radio emission had decayed but the balmer absorption is still visible . this population is not observed .",
    "therefore , we conclude that massive stars are currently being formed in these galaxies .    where is the site of the active star formation in the a+k / k+a cluster galaxies ?",
    "the optical spectra typically sample the whole of the bulge and disk of the galaxy ( see d99 ) and thus it is unlikely that we are missing emission from the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "we suggest instead that the star formation is occuring in the central regions of these galaxies but is hidden from view by the dust which we see there in our f702w@xmath70f160w images .",
    "this possibility was raised in p99 who stated that the most extreme e(a ) galaxies might appear as post - starburst systems ( a+k / k+a ) due to obscuration of the emission regions .",
    "the reddened regions lie in the central 510kpc of the galaxies ( fig .  3 & 4 ) and have optical  near - infrared colors which are typically @xmath105 magnitude redder than the outskirts of the galaxies .",
    "this would indicate optical extinctions of at least @xmath106mag to the population of disk stars ( let alone the active sites of star formation ) although this estimate is highly uncertain due to resolution effects .",
    "four of the five radio - selected post - starburst galaxies are disk galaxies and we can estimate their star formation rates ( sfr ) from their radio power using the calibration of condon ( 1992 ) . we find that these galaxies are typically forming massive stars ( @xmath107 ) at rates of @xmath108@xmath109 yr@xmath11 , with the highest sfrs being 30@xmath109 yr@xmath11 for # 122 and # 536 .",
    "this assumes no boosting of the radio emission due to compression of the galactic magnetic fields by the cluster icm , which could amount to a factor of @xmath110 ( andersen & owen 1995 ) . combining these sfrs with the @xmath52-band luminosities of the galaxies we can predict their [ oii ] fluxes if the star formation regions are unobscured using the relations given in kennicutt ( 1992 ) .",
    "we can then roughly estimate the amount of extinction needed for this line to be undetected in the optical spectra , ew([oii])@xmath111 .",
    "we find that the star forming regions would need to suffer @xmath112mag of extinction for the [ oii ] line to be undetected in the d99 spectra ( @xmath113mag if we assume the radio fluxes are artificially raised ) .",
    "this amount of obscuration is not unreasonable given the extent of the dust reddening seen in the f702@xmath70f160w images ( figs .  3 & 4 ) .",
    "we note that if we assume this dust is cold , @xmath114k , then the predicted sub - mm fluxes of these galaxies will be only @xmath115mjy at 850@xmath2 m .",
    "this is well below the confusion limit of current sub - mm instrumentation in blank fields .",
    "there are also examples of proposed dusty galaxies within our sample which are not detected in the radio map .",
    "in particular three of the cluster galaxies have e(a ) spectral features and evidence for dust in their f702@xmath70f160w images ( fig .  4 , # 177 , # 369 and # 622 ) .",
    "these galaxies are optically fainter than the e(a ) galaxy which is detected in the radio , # 36 , and it is possible that their lower overall luminosities mean that their radio emission is below the limit of the vla map . interestingly , although the e(a ) spectral class was interpreted as dusty starbursts in p99 , the radio map places upper limits on the current rate of massive star formation in the undetected e(a ) galaxies of @xmath116 yr@xmath11 , with similar limits applying to the galaxies with e(c ) spectra in the field ( e.g.  # 165 and # 497 in fig .  4 ) .",
    "taking the possible boosting of the radio emission due to compression of the galactic magnetic fields by the cluster icm (  3.1 ) into account these sfr limits could be dropped by a factor of two or more .",
    "we see a combination of post - starburst spectral features , radio emission and apparently large quantities of dust within the spiral galaxies in our sample .",
    "these characteristics can be most easily accomodated if they exist in spatially distinct regions of the galaxies , as suggested by our color maps .",
    "the radio emission would arise from massive star formation in the dust obscured center of the galaxy , while the a stars trace the remanents of an earlier ( @xmath85gyr ) strong star formation episode within the galactic disk .",
    "there is weak evidence in our sample for a correlation between h@xmath5 line strength and radio luminosity which would suggest that there is a causal link between the numbers of a stars and the current ( obscured ) star formation rate , probably as a result of a single triggering mechanism .",
    "this triggering mechanism could be a cluster - related phenomenum , a view which is supported by the lack of obvious post - starburst systems in samples of faint radio sources in the field ( hammer et al .",
    "1995 ; l.l .",
    "cowie , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "thus , we may be seeing a more dynamic situation including cluster - driven processes , whereby interactions between the intracluster medium and the cold molecular gas within the galactic disks accelerates the collapse and evaporation of the star forming regions .",
    "the effects of the icm on the galactic disk are expected to be a function of the local density in the disk  with lower density regions in the outskirts of the disks being most severely effected , while star formation continues almost uneffected in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "thus environmental processes could result in a combination of post - starburst and starburst within individual cluster galaxies .",
    "studies of the spatial distribution and kinematics of larger samples of radio - selected galaxies may be able to discriminate between the different physical processes which could be operating ( morrison et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , perhaps this activity may be triggered by a more general physical process , unrelated to the cluster environment .",
    "indeed , similar behaviour is seen in the models of interacting field galaxies published by mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) ( although we have argued that a substantial fraction of apparently disturbed cluster spiral galaxies probably arise from dust obscuration , rather than true interactions ) . for a range of models for tidal interactions between galaxies mihos & hernquist",
    "predict that spatially - extended enhanced star formation will first occur in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "this is followed on a timescale of a @xmath1170.3gyr by funnelling of any remaining gas into the center of the galaxy where it reaches very high densities and triggers an ( obscured ? ) nuclear starburst .",
    "again , more detailed investigation of the kinematics and internal dynamics of these galaxies may provide useful diagnostics to distinguish between the competing models .",
    "the picture which is appearing is one in which galaxies which are visibly forming stars appear to have modest star formation rates , @xmath118 yr@xmath11 ( @xmath107 ) , while more vigorous star formation , @xmath119@xmath120 yr@xmath11 is on - going in highly obscured regions in the centers of what appear to be post - starburst galaxies . if the radio fluxes of these distant galaxies are increased by the same environmental effects which are claimed to boost the radio emission of local cluster galaxies and to the same extent ( andersen & owen 1995 ) then the quoted sfrs should be reduced by a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "sensitive observations to search for h@xmath8 emission ( or emission lines further into the near - infrared ) will provide a stronger test of the star formation rates in these galaxies , the extent of obscuration within them and the degree to which their radio emission deviates from that seen in the distant field population due to environmental processes .",
    "finally we note that by having post - starburst and starburst phases occuring in parallel within a single galaxy it is possible to reduce the high fraction of galaxies ( @xmath122% , barger et al .",
    "1996 ) which must pass through this phase to explain the large numbers of post - starburst systems seen within distant clusters ( barger et al .  1996 ; p99 ) .",
    "in summary , we have highlighted the role that dust plays in obscuring our view of the morphologies and star formation properties of distant galaxies .",
    "we have shown that selection at faint radio fluxes provides a powerful technique for identifying spectrally - classified post - starburst and starburst galaxies crucial to our understanding of the evolutionary cycle of galaxies in clusters ( e.g.  p99 ) . using this new tool we can undertake statistical studies to search for the mechanism responsible for triggering and/or quenching of this activity ( p99 ; morrison et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are :    @xmath123 we present optical and near - infrared imaging with _",
    "hst _ of a region in the core of the distant rich cluster cl0939 + 4713 at @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath123 we compare the high resolution near - infrared and optical morphologies of a sample of 22 cluster members .",
    "this shows that while the broad morphological classifications are similar , the frequency of galaxies showing small - scale signatures of disturbance or interaction is substantially less when using the near - infrared imaging .",
    "we suggest that obscuration by dust has led optical studies to conclude that an anomalously high fraction of galaxies have suffered small scale disturbances .",
    "this may point to a wider prevelance of dust in cluster galaxies at @xmath102 , perhaps as a result of the increased star formation activity at these epochs .",
    "@xmath123 using a very deep vla 1.4-ghz map of this area we select a sample of ten radio galaxies in our field above a flux limit of @xmath124jy , equivalent to a restframe 1.4-ghz power of @xmath125 whz at the cluster redshift .",
    "the faint radio sources are associated with two populations of cluster galaxies : luminous early - type galaxies , the radio emission from these galaxies originates from agn ; and dusty galaxies with late - type spiral morphologies , the radio emission here is expected to trace massive star formation ( although the exact relationship between the radio luminosity and the sfr is uncertain due to environmental influences ) .",
    "@xmath123 the optical spectral characteristics of the late - type radio members are highly unusual  they appear to be post - starburst systems .",
    "we suggest that these galaxies are not post - starburst but in fact host highly obscured star - formation and starbursts .",
    "this is supported by our high resolution optical  near - infrared imaging which shows that the central regions of these galaxies are heavily dust enshrouded .",
    "if they continued for several @xmath126myrs , these dust enshrouded nuclear - starbursts could build a substantial stellar bulge in the remanent of these luminous disk galaxies , possibly contributing to the formation of the s0 population in the clusters ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath123 we emphasise that a lack of consideration of the effects of dust on the morphological and spectral properties of galaxies , even at the relatively modest redshifts discussed here , may lead to an incomplete understanding of the cycle of star formation in cluster galaxies",
