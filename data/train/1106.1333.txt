    "cold atoms provide a new platform in which one can explore long standing open questions of strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , two - component fermi mixtures in an optical lattice provide an ideal realization of the fermionic hubbard model , where two species of fermions  corresponding to the spin @xmath0  interact with an on - site repulsion .",
    "this model is relevant for understanding properties of electrons in several classes of novel quantum materials including oxides and high-@xmath1 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "there are currently many efforts to probe the low - temperature physics of such a model , with experiments already demonstrating the mott insulating behavior expected in this model  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of strongly correlated ultracold atoms is that traditional probes used in solid state physics are often not readily available .",
    "one thus needs to understand how experimental techniques appropriate for atomic ensembles can provide information on many - body states . in this paper",
    "we focus on understanding lattice modulation experiments with fermions in optical lattices .",
    "the technique of lattice modulation was originally introduced for bosonic systems and absorbed energy was measured as a function of modulation frequency  @xcite . measuring energy absorption , however , can not be done accurately enough for strongly interacting fermions .",
    "thus an extension of this technique was proposed ,  @xcite and implemented  @xcite , in which the number of doubly occupied sites created by the lattice modulation was measured .",
    "recent experiments successfully reached the regime of weak perturbations in which the number of doublons created scales quadratically with the modulation amplitude ( fermi s golden rule ) and the modulation pulse duration  @xcite .    while theoretical understanding of such experiments with bosons is now relatively complete  @xcite , the case of fermions turned out to be more challenging .",
    "the main difficulty is the presence of excitations at very different energy scales : high - energy charge excitations , so - called doublons and holons , that have energies set by the on - site repulsion @xmath2 and fermion hopping strength @xmath3 , and magnetic excitations that have energies of the order of superexchange energy @xmath4 .",
    "understanding the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom in the hubbard model is a long standing problem in condensed matter physics  @xcite . in the special case of half filling and fully disordered spin states , analysis of lattice modulation experiments has been performed previously  @xcite",
    ". however , such analysis is not sufficient for quantitative comparison to experiments which are done with systems in a parabolic potential that have a large number of atoms outside of the incompressible mott plateaus .",
    "furthermore such real - time dynamics at finite temperature as seen in current experiments is problematic for numerics .",
    "monte carlo simulations  @xcite suffer from the problems of analytic continuation .",
    "density - matrix renormalization group approaches , which can deal with real time dynamics , are so far limited to one dimension .",
    "therefore , a comparison of dynamical quantities to experiments is a non - trivial theoretical subject .    in this paper",
    "we develop another analytical approach to calculate finite - temperature dynamics , that is , the doublon production rate ( dpr ) , based on the slave - particle technique  @xcite .",
    "this approach is particularly adapted to the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model , and can be applied to any filling of the band and finite temperatures whose region is relevant to ongoing experiments .",
    "it provides a remarkable agreement to the experiments and allows for potential extensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the system hamiltonian , and introduce the slave - particle representation in sec .",
    "[ sec : slave - part - repr ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagrammatic - analys ] , the spectral functions of the slave particles are evaluated , and in addition the spectral function of the original fermionic atom is also obtained . in sec .",

    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary .",
    "we consider the hubbard model @xmath5 with    @xmath6    [ eq : hubbard_model ]    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , a creation and number operator of a spin-@xmath9 fermions at a @xmath10th site .",
    "we use the following slave - particle representation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , creation operators of a slave boson of spin-@xmath9 state ( schwinger boson ) , holon and doublon at a site @xmath10 .",
    "they satisfy the ( anti-)commutation relations , @xmath15=\\delta_{i , j}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}$ ] and @xmath16 .",
    "the enlarged hilbert space is projected onto the physical one by the following constraint at every site : @xmath17 equation  ( [ eq : sf - sb ] ) allows us to rewrite the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hubbard_model ] ) as @xmath18 ,   \\label{eq : tunnelinghamiltonian } \\\\   & h_{\\rm at }     = \\sum_{j }        \\left [          \\epsilon^{\\rm d}_{j}d^{\\dagger}_{j}d_{j }          + \\epsilon^{\\rm h}_{j } h^{\\dagger}_{j}h_{j }          + \\sum_{\\sigma}\\epsilon^{\\rm b}_{j } b^{\\dagger}_{j\\sigma}b_{j\\sigma }          -\\lambda_j        \\right ] , \\label{eq : atomichamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 mean the hopping of slave bosons and the creation of spin singlet pair , respectively .",
    "the local potentials of a slave boson , holon , and doublon are , respectively , defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the constraint  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is implemented via the lagrange multiplier @xmath24 .",
    "we start with the atomic limit ( @xmath25 ) . then the kinetic term  ( [ eq : tunnelinghamiltonian ] ) which describes the scattering among slave particles vanishes .",
    "since the atomic hamiltonian  ( [ eq : atomichamiltonian ] ) is quadratic , the atomic propagators at @xmath10th site are easily obtained as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the matsubara frequency for bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "note that the atomic limit propagators of slave bosons are independent of the spin .",
    "this means that the atomic limit exhibits spin - incoherent paramagnetism .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath29 .",
    "let us suppose the mean - field ( mf ) @xmath24 to be determined by the atomic limit .",
    "namely , the self - consistent equation for @xmath24 corresponds to the statistical average of the constraint  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) in the atomic limit : @xmath30 where the prefactor @xmath31 comes from the spin degrees of freedom . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the fermi and bose distribution functions .",
    "one can expect that if the effect of the kinetic energy @xmath34 is small , that is , at relatively high temperature compared to the kinetic energy , the validity of this treatment should be guaranteed .",
    "we thus use the mf assumption for the lagrange multiplier : @xmath35 . simultaneously the local potentials are also replaced by the homogeneous ones : @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "corresponding to the mf treatment for the lagrange multiplier , the atomic propagators also become independent of sites : for example , the replacement of @xmath35 leads the slave boson propagator @xmath38 where the site - independent propagator is defined as @xmath39    let us solve the self - consistent equation  ( [ eq : sce - lambda ] ) . for @xmath40 ,",
    "( [ eq : sce - lambda ] ) can be simplified , and solved analytically as follows : @xmath41 as discussed below , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sce - lambda ] ) is numerically solved , and we compare the numerical result with eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf - lagrange - multiplier ] ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath42 leads the estimation of the slave particle densities .",
    "the density of each slave particle is given by the mf solution @xmath42 : @xmath43 for a slave boson , @xmath44 for a holon and @xmath45 for a doublon .",
    "the temperature and chemical potential dependency of them are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slave - density ] . in the temperature region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slave - density ] , the results analytically given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf - lagrange - multiplier ] ) are in precise agreement with ones given by the numerically solved @xmath42 .",
    "it means that in such a regime we may always employ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf - lagrange - multiplier ] ) as a solution of the mf self - consistent equation  ( [ eq : sce - lambda ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the densities in the atomic limit can be exactly calculated as shown in appendix  [ sec : app2 ] . here",
    "we take the exact densities to be @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and their temperature and chemical potential dependency is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : slave - density ] .",
    "the exact result allows us to discuss the temperature and chemical potential regime justifying the slave particle approach . from the comparison made in fig .",
    "[ fig : slave - density ] , the slave particle technique is found to agree with the exact result in the temperature and chemical potential region where @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in other words the slave particle technique",
    "is expected to be reasonable when the system is near a mott insulator , and such temperature as a benchmark is below @xmath51 .",
    "we now consider a finite but small hopping by taking the infinite series of diagrams produced by the scattering @xmath34 among the slave particles , based on the non - crossing ( nc ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation can be also regarded as a certain type of high temperature series expansion ( htse )  @xcite , but in our formalism the wick theorem is still applicable due to the quadratic hamiltonian  ( [ eq : atomichamiltonian ] ) , and a particular infinite series of kinetic energy perturbation can be taken .",
    "based on the nc approximation the self - energy diagrams constructed by full propagators , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : non - crossing - diagram ] , are considered .",
    "are taken for large @xmath2 , the diagram ( b ) would be irrelevant .",
    "the holon self - energy is also given by the same type of diagrams . ]",
    "since one is in a temperature regime higher than the anti - ferromagnetic exchange @xmath52 , we apply the spin - incoherent assumption to the slave boson propagator .",
    "namely , the slave boson propagators in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : non - crossing - diagram ] are replaced by the atomic one  ( [ eq : mean - field - spinon - propagator ] ) , @xmath53 the doublon and holon propagators are left full ones : namely , by using the dyson equation the full propagators are written as @xmath54 unlike the standard mf theory , the dynamical fluctuation of the slave bosons is retained here , which is necessary to describe the doublon - holon excitation . the nc diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : non - crossing - diagram ] ( b ) couples the self - consistent equations of the doublon and holon self - energy .",
    "however , the contribution is negligibly small because it is a far off - shell diagram in this case such as mott state .",
    "consequently the self - consistent equations of the self - energy fig .",

    "note that due to the momentum dependence of the right - hand side the self - energy should be given as a local quantity : @xmath59 .",
    "consequently the propagator also turns out to be local : @xmath60 .",
    "thus the self - consistent equation  ( [ eq : sce - selfenergy ] ) is easily solved through the dyson equation  ( [ eq : dyson - equation ] ) as follows : @xmath61 through the analytic continuation the doublon spectral function , which is equivalent to the density of state ( dos ) in this case , is also obtained . in this approximation ,",
    "a semi - circle type dos is formed : @xmath62 one can also obtain the self - energy and spectral function of the holon in the same way .",
