    "the concept of mass - varying neutrinos ( mvns ) has been introduced by imposing a relation between neutrinos and the dark energy of the universe  @xcite through a scalar field , the acceleron . including the possibility of acceleron couplings to matter fields implies that the neutrino oscillation parameters in vacuum and a medium could be very different  @xcite , irrespective of the standard msw effect  @xcite .",
    "mvns can have substantial implications for neutrino phenomenology , for example in the sun  @xcite or for cosmology and astrophysics  @xcite , and they have been proposed as an explanation of the lsnd anomaly  @xcite .    given existing data , precision tests of mass - varying effects are very difficult , since the different experiments are conducted under different conditions ( different energies , baselines , matter distributions , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "practically , all evidence for neutrino oscillations so far involves neutrino paths in ( solar or earth ) matter , whereas no direct information is available on oscillation parameters in vacuum or air .",
    "moreover , the precise dependence of the neutrino masses on the matter density through the acceleron coupling is rather model dependent .",
    "the only plausible laboratory for a direct comparison between neutrino oscillations in different environments ( _ e.g. _ , matter and air ) are short - baseline experiments . in this work ,",
    "we consider the possibility to constrain mvns with reactor experiments , which are planned to measure the mixing angle @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "such experiments are particularly suitable for this purpose , because one could think about building two very similar experiments with different material along the baseline , or even about moving the material along the baseline .",
    "in addition , reactor experiments suffer very little from correlations among the oscillation parameters , and new reactor experiments with identical near and far detectors will have an excellent sensitivity to @xmath2 . since the standard msw effect is irrelevant for such short baselines , any deviation of the energy spectrum between matter and air can then be interpreted in terms of mvns .",
    "for the reactor experiments under consideration , the ordinary matter potential is , to a first approximation , negligible because of the short baseline .",
    "the oscillation probability reads in the expansion up to second order in @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( _ cf .",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "thus , one can easily see that short - baseline reactor experiments have an excellent sensitivity to @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath7 , one can read off from this equation that for large @xmath8 the second term is practically negligible , and we can use this formula in the two - flavor limit for analytical purposes .",
    "suppose that we have _ any _ non - standard effect on neutrino oscillations on the hamiltonian level which is different in air and matter . in this case",
    ", we have the usual vacuum hamiltonian @xmath9 in air , and some non - standard hamiltonian @xmath10 in matter . in general",
    ", @xmath11 is a hermitian traceless @xmath12 matrix ( for details , see _ e.g._ref .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 can then be re - diagonalized in order to obtain the effective mixing angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 in matter . in order to parameterize deviations between matter ( tilde ) and air ( no tilde ) parameters ,",
    "we define @xmath16 for mvns one has  @xcite @xmath17^\\dagger   \\left[\\hat m - m(\\rho ) \\right ] u^\\dagger \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the diagonal matrix of the neutrino masses and @xmath19 is the mixing matrix , both in the background dominated environment ( _ e.g. _ , air ) , and @xmath20 is the mass matrix depending on the matter density @xmath21 , which in general is non - diagonal in the basis used in eq .",
    "( [ equ : mvn ] ) .",
    "hence , one finds that in the case of mvns @xmath9 and @xmath11 have the _ same _ energy dependence , _ i.e. _ , it is indeed the mass matrix which is modified .",
    "note that according to eq .",
    "( [ equ : mvn ] ) , @xmath11 also depends on the @xmath22 .    in the following",
    "we will assume that the neutrinos propagate either through air or through matter with constant density .",
    "this allows a model - independent test of mvns , since only the density difference enters , and we need not to specify the detailed functional dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that environment - dependent variations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be neglected , and the two parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 suffice to describe mvn effects for reactor experiments under consideration",
    ". this assumption can be justified by requiring the consistency of solar neutrino and kamland data , due to the much higher matter densities in the sun .",
    "the typical size of mvn parameters relevant for solar neutrinos @xcite is about one order of magnitude smaller than the sensitivity of short - baseline reactor experiments , and in particular , if the bounds derived in ref .  @xcite are applied , mvn effects on @xmath28 and @xmath25 can be neglected ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] ) .",
    "we stress that reactor experiments test _ different _ mvn parameters than solar neutrino experiments .",
    "let us add , that for non - standard matter effects apart from mvns ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) the energy dependence of @xmath11 may be different than the one of @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , there may be a relative factor @xmath29 between @xmath9 and @xmath11 leading to energy - dependent matter parameters similar to the standard msw matter effect ( _ cf .",
    "_ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case , the assumption of an energy - independent effect can still be used as an approximation for short - baseline reactor experiments ( by using the peak energy of the spectrum ) as long as the neutrino energy is far away from the msw resonance energy .",
    "this requirement is only violated if the non - standard effects are more than two orders of magnitude larger than the standard msw matter effect .",
    "in principle , we expect to obtain the best mvn sensitivities by the comparison of a matter to an air experiment .",
    "as we will see , using reactor experiments for the test of mvns is mainly a matter of geometry .",
    "some experiments have their baseline in air ( such as double chooz ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and others have it mostly in matter or mixed between air and matter sections .",
    "in addition , moving detectors have been discussed . currently , three major principle schemes of reactor experiment layouts , which can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : types ] , are :    type ( a ) : :    baseline mostly in air . example : double chooz  @xcite . type ( b ) : :    baseline entirely in matter because of flat terrain .",
    "example :    braidwood  @xcite , kaska  @xcite .",
    "type ( c ) : :    baseline mostly in matter because of hills .",
    "examples : daya    bay  @xcite , angra  @xcite",
    ".    one could now think about three different conceptual cases to test mvn effects .",
    "first , one could use existing ( future ) experiments with baselines in air and matter and combine them , such as double chooz or a larger reactor experiment in air combined with another reactor experiment in matter , or the long - baseline beam experiments t2k or no@xmath30a .",
    "second , one could modify the existing experiments . in phase",
    "i , the experiment runs unmodified , and in a subsequent phase  ii the material in the line of sight of the far detector is changed .",
    "examples of these modifications can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : types ] . for type ( a )",
    ", the far detector s line of sight could be covered with earth or a rock wall . for type ( b ) , a hole in the ground would lead to air propagation in the far detector s line of sight . and for type ( c ) , the access tunnel to the far detector could a priori be built in the line of sight of far detector which is then covered with earth or rock wall in phase  ii .",
    "alternatively , one could drill an additional tunnel . as the last conceptual case",
    ", one could use a vertically or horizontally moving detector and the geometry of the site to change the material between source and detector .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     finally , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : rescomp ] , right , the most optimistic results for the _ same _ experiment , _",
    "i.e. _ , using reactor - ii when 1.5  km of the matter is removed after the phase  i run . for both phases",
    "we assume a running time of 5 years .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we simulate this situation by setting all systematical errors to zero , which leads to a further improvement of the sensitivity to @xmath27 . as highlighted in table  [",
    "tab : results ] , such a setup allows a test of mvns at the level of a few per cent at @xmath31  cl .",
    "in the preceding section , we have demonstrated that reactor experiments could provide powerful tests of any neutrino oscillation model which is different in air and matter in the @xmath32-@xmath2 sector .",
    "now we discuss some mass - varying neutrino model - dependent aspects .",
    "let us first estimate the sensitivity to the elements @xmath33 , @xmath34 of the environment - dependent mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ equ : mvn ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath35 . assuming an accuracy @xmath36",
    ", a rough estimation gives a sensitivity of @xmath37 .",
    "now one can consider for example the following model for the environment - dependent mass matrix  @xcite : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes a fermion in the medium , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) are the yukawa couplings of neutrinos ( the fermion @xmath39 ) to the acceleron , @xmath42 is the number density of @xmath39 , and @xmath43 is the acceleron mass . if we consider only the coupling to electrons , we have @xmath44  ev@xmath45 in earth matter ( for @xmath46 ) , and we find the following order of magnitude for the sensitivity of reactor experiments to the model parameters : @xmath47 this number has to be compared to the value @xmath48 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the sensitivity of solar neutrino data to mvn parameters in the 1 - 2 sector .",
    "naively one expects that solar neutrino experiments are much more sensitive to mvn effects than reactor experiments , since there is roughly a factor of 100 between the densities in the solar core and earth matter , and there is another factor @xmath49 , which characterizes the mass scale sensitivity of the experiments .",
    "however , these factors are partially compensated by the high precision of reactor experiments , @xmath50 .    in principle solar+kamland",
    "neutrino data have some sensitivity to @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the above argument on the factor 100 between the densities in the sun and the earth suggests that solar data should also be able to provide some information on mvn effects for @xmath1 .",
    "such a constraint requires model - dependent assumptions about the density dependence , since one has to relate the environment - dependent values of @xmath1 inside the sun , in earth matter , and in air . depending on such model assumptions",
    ", one could have constraints on @xmath27 from solar neutrino data , which could change the interpretation of our results : for @xmath27 fixed to @xmath51 , already planned experiments in matter in combination with double chooz will provide very good results for @xmath26 ( _ cf .",
    "_ , left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rescomp ] ) .",
    "a very particular mass - varying neutrino model has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the lsnd experiment and a potential null result in miniboone by the combination of mass - varying neutrinos and one additional sterile neutrino mixing with the active ones in matter .",
    "since this model predicts no oscillations in air for short - baseline reactor experiments , a signal for @xmath2 in air ( for example in double chooz ) would be a strong rejection of this model , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath26 has to be tested only of the order of one .",
    "furthermore , our setups can test any additional sterile neutrinos with mixings different in air and matter  @xcite as follows : if the fast oscillation frequency associated with the sterile neutrinos @xmath52 leads to oscillation effects already at the near detector site ( such as for @xmath53 ) , then both the near and far detectors will observe a reduced overall flux .",
    "this can neither be faked by @xmath2 nor @xmath32 being different in matter .",
    "thus , a sterile neutrino contribution in matter can be measured on the level the reactor flux is known , typically some per cent , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have considered several reactor experiment setups with baselines in air and matter to constrain any non - standard contribution to the hamiltonian which is different in air and matter . in particular",
    ", we find that new reactor experiments with near and far detectors could provide stringent bounds for mass - varying neutrino models , which lead to environment dependent effects in the 1 - 3 sector ( @xmath32 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "non - trivial constraints can be obtained already from double chooz ( mainly air ) combined with a matter experiment , although in this case correlations between the parameters limit the sensitivity .",
    "best results , however , are obtained if two identical setups with baselines of at least @xmath54 with substantially different material between the near and far detectors are compared . for @xmath55 ,",
    "deviations of oscillation parameters in matter and air can be constrained at the level of few per cent . using the same experiment and physically moving the matter between the two detectors after the initial operation period decreases the impact of systematical errors . in this case , the relevant systematics issue is the uncorrelated time - dependent change between the near and far detectors , which should be extremely small for practical purposes .",
    "we conclude that new reactor experiments could be excellent candidates for the test of mass - varying neutrinos provided that @xmath2 is not to small .",
