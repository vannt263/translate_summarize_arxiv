    "current cosmological observations , mainly from type ia supernovae , show that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this accelerated expansion has been attributed to a dark energy component with negative pressure . the simplest explanation for this dark energy seems to be the cosmological constant .",
    "however , among many candidates @xcite , some modified gravity models have also been proposed based on , for example , @xmath0 theories @xcite .",
    "some models based on modified teleparallel gravity were presented as an alternative to inflationary models @xcite or showing a cosmological solution for the acceleration of the universe by means of a sort of theories of modified gravity , namely @xmath1 @xcite , based on a modification of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) lagrangian @xcite where _ dark torsion _ is the responsible for the observed acceleration of the universe , and the field equations are always 2nd order equations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this fact makes these theories simpler than the dynamical equations resulting in @xmath0 theories among other advantages . recently , in @xcite this sort of modified gravity theories was called @xmath2 theories and some works have begun to develop in this area @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the tension and systematics in the gold06 sne ia data set have been investigated in great detail .",
    "other authors , working with different sne ia sets found these were in tension with other sne ia sets and also with bao and cmb @xcite . in @xcite , analyzing the union data set @xcite , the uniont truncated data set was built by discarding the supernovae generating the tension by using the @xmath3cdm model to select the outliers . in @xcite , performing the same truncation procedure of @xcite for 10 different models , it was suggested that the impact of different models would be negligible .    in this work we present thorough observational information useful to work with @xmath2 theories by using the latest union2 sne ia compilation released @xcite , the new combined parameter from baryon acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background radiation ( bao / cmb ) @xcite ( more suitable for non - standard models than the usually used @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters ) , a gamma - ray burst data set @xcite and constraints from observational hubble data ( ohd ) @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section ii we review the fundamental concepts about @xmath2 theories to , in section iii , analyze a criterion of tension to improve the study of the new data sets including bao / cmb and grbs . in section iv we perform the truncation of union2 calculating the relative deviation to the best fit of the @xmath2 prediction for each one of the 557 points following @xcite in order to show the disappearing of tension and establishing a new set suitable for @xmath2 theories . in section",
    "v we add the ohd observational information and discuss some remarkable results and , in section vi , we summarize the conclusions of this work .",

    "the case @xmath27 corresponds to tegr . in an @xmath2 theory the spinless matter couples to the metric in the standard form .",
    "therefore , the equations of a freely falling particle are the equations of the geodesics . moreover , the source in the equations for the geometry results to be the matter energy - momentum tensor . in these aspects",
    "there is no difference with gr .",
    "if matter is distributed isotropically and homogeneously , the metric is the frw metric and all kinematic equations ( luminosity distance , angular distance , cosmological redshift , etc . )",
    "will be identical to the gr case .",

    "the separate @xmath48 of sne ia , bao / cmb , grbs and ohd and the corresponding data sets used in this work are shown in appendix b. in order to see whether our model is favored over the @xmath3cdm model , we will also use the information criterion known as @xmath49 ( akaike information criterion ) @xcite .",

    "we found interesting to analyze what would happen if we applied a criterion in order to study the consistency between data sets , a criterion more restrictive than the only fact that the confidence intervals overlap . to perform this analysis",
    ", we adopted the criterion of considering the existence of tension between a given data set and another set constituted combining several data sets ( including the first one ) as the fact that the best fit point to the first data set is out of the 68.3% ( 1@xmath57 ) confidence level contour given by the combined data set .",
    "similar criteria were adopted in their analysis by @xcite .",
    "one could choose not to use this more restrictive criterion ; however , we wanted to investigate its consequences of applying it to several data sets in the framework of @xmath2 theories . in @xcite , for example , the best fits to sets and subsets of sne are compared with the means of determining if two of those are in tension or not , and how far from the confidence intervals lies the @xmath3cdm model . with our adopted criterion ,",
    "we seek more physical consistency between best - fits , so the best fits do not drive to too different cosmological evolutions .",
    "the best fit which effective equation of state is of the phantom type @xcite ( @xmath58 ) tells us about very different physics from the one that is not .",
    "also , best fits that lie too far apart from @xmath3cdm model ( @xmath45 or @xmath59=-1 ) will indicate the need of more exotic models .",
    "something important to consider is that the best fits to the sne or their combination depend also on the fitter used to process the sne data sets .",
    "avoiding this type of tension we make sure that in most cases both best fits ( sne ia and combined data sets ) have similar results in the equation of state @xmath59 or the @xmath39 parameter . in the @xmath60cdm ( @xmath60=const ) framework , for example",

    "plane for the uniont observations of sne ia only ( dashed lines ) and uniont sne ia , bao and cmb ( solid lines ) . we also show the best fit values to the observations of uniont sne ia only ( star ) , and to the combination of uniont sne ia , bao and cmb ( triangle).,width=264 ]    then , with this criterion , in our previous work @xcite existed some tension between the data from the sne ia union sample @xcite and bao @xcite and cmb @xcite . taking the truncated uniont data set from @xcite we proceeded to evaluate the possible tension between uniont , bao and cmb .",
    "we found there was still tension between these data sets as shown in fig .",
    "on one hand , the best fit to sne ia is of the phantom type and the one corresponding to the combined set is not and , on the other hand , the best fit to sne ia drives @xmath24 in recombination to be 20% greater than for the best fit to sne+bao+cmb , and @xmath59 today to be 35% greater . considering the mentioned criterion ,",
    "uniont eliminates the tension between data in some models as shown in @xcite , but it is not the case with @xmath2 .    instead of continuing truncating the union set",
    ", now we proceeded to use the latest sne ia data set union2 @xcite ( processed with salt2 light - curve fitter @xcite ) and the combined parameter bao / cmb .",
    "this combined bao / cmb parameter implemented in @xcite is more suitable to add constraints to non - standard models ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "the best fit to the union2 sne ia data set only , was achieved with @xmath61 and @xmath62 with the reduced @xmath63 ( or equivalently , @xmath64 with respect to @xmath3cdm with @xmath65 @xcite ) , where @xmath66 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "all the results with their corresponding 1@xmath57 uncertainties and the analysis from the @xmath49 criterion are summarized in table [ results ] .    working only with the new bao / cmb parameter we found the value of @xmath39 for the best fit is remarkably higher than with other data sets ( @xmath67 ) , although more efficient in constraining @xmath47 ( in contrast to working with bao and cmb parameters separately ) having a range of values more consistent with other observations , such as weak lensing and its combination with cmb and sne ia ( e.g. @xcite ) . in our case",
    "we found @xmath68 .",
    "these values ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) perform a better fit than @xmath3cdm by a @xmath69 . comparing these results with our previous work @xcite , we also found that including this combined parameter , the value of @xmath39 for the best fit using bao / cmb or its combination with the rest of the data sets results always greater than zero .",
    "therefore , the effective dark torsion is of the phantom type @xcite .",
    "this result is also in opposition with recent constraints when bao and cmb are used separately through the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 respectively @xcite . combining the sne ia data with bao / cmb data we found the best fit , which can be seen in table [ results ] .",
    "we added to our analysis a data set of observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . knowing that there are still debates about",
    "if these objects are standard candles ( e.g. @xcite ) , we followed the policy assumed in other published works such as @xcite to see how our results are modified and to check the consistency of both approaches presented by @xcite and @xcite in the framework of @xmath2 theories .",
    "recently , in @xcite it has been demonstrated that the data set of @xcite is consistent with union2 .",
    "one could do the analysis using data sets consisting of sne ia and grbs separately .",
    "otherwise , an analysis can be made compiling union2 and one grbs data sets together @xcite .",
    "these two separate analysis showed identical results ( see appendix a ) .",
    "here we used the approach developed in @xcite firstly for being a set - independent data set , this means this set is not only applicable with union2 , but with any other sne ia data set .",
    "most importantly , we used this data set because evaluating it separately from the sne ia is more helpful in our work of finding tension between sne ia data and other data sets .",
    "otherwise , in case of finding tension we might have needed to truncate a combination of sne+grbs data set , being this last a sum of different data . when incorporating grbs to the joint statistic we observed that the addition of the mentioned observations slightly reduce the size of the confidence intervals and the joint best fit is displayed in table [ results ] .    in fig .",
    "[ snvssuma]a , we show the confidence intervals of sne ia with the combination of sne+bao / cmb+grbs . there , it can be easily seen that with the adopted criterion for the tension between data sets , there is a slight tension between union2 and the other data sets .",
    "plane for the union2 observations of sne ia only ( dashed lines ) and union2 sne+bao / cmb+grbs ( solid lines ) .",
    "we also show the best fit values to the observations of union2 sne ia only ( star ) , and to the combination of union2 sne+bao / cmb+grbs ( dot ) .",

    "we followed the simple method used in @xcite to find the outliers responsible for the tension . in @xcite the distance moduli of the six sne ia which are mostly responsible for the tension in gold06 data set differ by more than @xmath70 from the @xmath3cdm prediction . in @xcite 21 sne ia",
    "were discarded to build the uniont set in order to eliminate the tension with cmb and bao .",
    "similarly , we firstly fitted our @xmath2 model to the whole 557 sne ia in the union2 data set and found the best fit parameters ( with the corresponding @xmath71 ) .",
    "then , we calculated the relative deviation to the best fit prediction , @xmath72 , for all the 557 data points .",
    "we found that as in @xcite the cut @xmath73 solved the tension problem .",
    "this cut implied to take out 39 sne ia from union2 . with the remaining 518 sne",

    "when the new bao / cmb parameter is used instead of the frequently used @xmath5 and @xmath4 parameters separately the best fit values change with respect to previous works . from table",
    "[ results ] we see that all best fit values are for @xmath75 , leading the effective equation of state to be phantom like .",
    "note that in all cases where sne ia data were involved , we used the union2 data set which was processed with salt2 fitter and this could be an additional factor in the obtained results as showed in @xcite .",
    "adding grb data did not modify the results appreciatively and we also found that two approximations performed by different authors are consistent between them and lead to the same results .",
    "we found that when including information from ohd to put constraints , as in the bao / cmb case , an equation of state of the phantom type is favored .",
    "remarkably , the simpler @xmath3cdm model lies outside the 68.3% confidence level region of the combined sne+bao / cmb+grbs+ohd data .",
    "the values that lie at 68.3% are in the ranges @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the adopted criterion of tension between data sets in this work and the truncation process performed to union2 data set allowed us , firstly , that the physics that determines the cosmological evolution through the @xmath39 parameter does not differ much when only the sne are considered or when those are combined with other data sets , and secondly , that each data set is consistent amongst the others . in every case , eliminating tension leaded to reduce at least to one half the ratio between values of @xmath59 in @xmath78 and @xmath24 in recombination , obtained from the best fits to sne alone or their combination with other data sets . additionally , the removal of tension by this criterion resulted in , when combining union2 t data set with bao / cmb+grb+ohd , the @xmath3cdm model to lie inside the 1@xmath57 joint probability region of the data set with all observations . from table",

    "here we show the result of adding to the performed analysis with the union2 sne ia data set , the set hymnium of 59 grbs according to @xcite .    with the objective of comparing the obtained results when adding grbs to sne ia data and bao / cmb using the 5 values set of @xcite and when adding the data sets in the way performed in @xcite , we observed the differences in the 68.3% and 95.4% confidence intervals of both methods .",

    "the first is relevant for the bao , the second for the cmb , and @xmath117 ( using values from @xcite ) .",
    "inserting this into ( [ soll ] ) and taking into account the correlation between these measurements using the correlation coefficient of 0.337 calculated by @xcite , gives the final constraints we use for the cosmology analysis @xcite : @xmath118    using this bao / cmb parameter cancels out some of the dependence on the sound horizon size at last scattering .",
