    "( [ electric_cond ] ) , ( [ heatcond ] ) , ( [ zetatmu ] ) , and ( [ etatmu ] ) .",
    "that our plsm results agree well with first - principle lattice calculations refers to good modelling for the relaxation time and precise estimation for various plsm parameters .    with the introduction of the polyakov - loop potential to lsm , which have two main characteristics , namely the pure gauge potential and the absence of gluon interaction ,",

    "we have found that the su(@xmath17 ) plsm fits well with the lattice qcd calculations , especially from the hot - qcd collaboration .",
    "the chiral subtracted condensates and the order parameters are in good agreement with recent lattice calculations .",
    "for instance , they confirm the steeper decrease around the phase transition .",
    "the electrical conductivity has been estimated for a qcd system , in which the scattering of quarks and gluons are conjectured to be either elastic or inelastic .",

    "we have deduced the dimensionless electrical conductivity normalized to @xmath113 and confronted this to recent lattice qcd .",

    "the bulk viscosity which is related to various thermodynamic quantities , is calculated from the green - kubo correlation .",
    "this quantity is strongly related to the phase transition and apparently responses to the instability in the hydrodynamic flow of the resulting partonic plasma . at temperatures close to @xmath117 , the ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy rapidly decreases and",
    "a first - order phase - transition can be characterized .",
    "there is a good agreement with the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the sharp increase , especially when approaching the phase transition , is conjectured to induce instability in the hydrodynamic flow of the partonic plasma .",
    "the shear viscosity is assumed as a very suitable tool sensitive to the quark - hadron phase - transition . a good agreement with the lattice qcd calculations and with other effective qcd - like models was observed .",
    "it is noteworthy referring to the low value of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy ratio .",
    "this is caused by the strong interactions and the decrease in the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "the ratio of shear viscosity and the electrical conductivity is confronted to recent lattice qcd calculations .",
    "a good agreement can be reported .",
    "in particular , the low values of shear viscosity - to - entropy ratio are assumed to reflect low qgp viscosity caused by the stronger interactions and the reduction in the partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we argued that the ratio of both bulk and shear viscosities ( each is normalized to the thermal entropy ) and the dimensionless electrical conductivity , @xmath145 and @xmath150 would be able to favor or disfavor different phenomenological scenarios from plsm ( present work ) or pnjl or dqpm , especially when qgp cools down towards @xmath117 .",
    "their different independent behaviors of the the different properties of qgp are regulated by the relative strength and the chemical composition of the qgp .",

    "we conclude that the present plsm results on various transport properties , bulk viscosity ( @xmath134 ) , shear viscosity ( @xmath147 ) , electrical conductivity ( @xmath151 ) and thermal conductivity ( @xmath149 ) , show the essential ingredients that these properties would add to the study of hot and dense qcd matter .",
