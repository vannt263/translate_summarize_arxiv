    "surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) has received much of attention recently due to a very broad range of its applications ranging from optics and plasmonics to biochemistry and medicine  @xcite .",

    "this yields similar em properties over a broad range of excitation frequencies both in the far- and in the near - field zone , originating from exciton and plasmon excitations , respectively .",
    "excitons and plasmons are different in their physical nature , but originate from the same circumferentially quantized electronic transitions . due to the circumferential quantization of the longitudinal electron motion , real axial ( along the cn axis ) optical conductivities of single wall cns consist of series of peaks @xmath2 , representing the 1st , 2nd , etc .",
