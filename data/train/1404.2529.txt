    "with the advent of neutrino oscillation data , in particular in the early 2000 s , the tribimaximal ( tbm ) neutrino mixing pattern @xcite became a paradigm for model building aiming to understand the neutrino mixing through an underlying flavor symmetry .",
    "the paradigm however , has been challenged by recent reactor experiments @xcite which have excluded a zero reactor mixing angle at more than @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "expanding the neutrino mass matrix in terms of its eigenvectors , and with current neutrino data taken into account @xcite , one can quantify in a useful way the deviations in the structure of the mass matrix from the tbm - form @xcite , are then small due to the `` small '' measured value of the reactor mixing angle @xmath3 .",
    "given that the observations are consistent with an approximate tbm - form , the idea of an underlying flavor symmetry responsible for the neutrino mixing pattern is arguably well motivated .",
    "indeed a very widely explored possibility is that of a flavor symmetry @xmath4 provides at the leading order ( lo ) a tbm - form neutrino mass matrix and the deviations demanded by data are obtained through next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections .",
    "this approach however , at least in the most simple implementations , does not provide a compelling solution since quite often a non - zero reactor angle implies either a solar or atmospheric angles ( or both ) outside their experimental ranges @xcite .",
    "since the nlo approach is not particularly favored by data , it is important to consider alternative possibilities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the tbm - form plus small deviations structure , can be interpreted as a hint that different mechanisms participate in the generation of neutrino masses , so - called `` hybrid neutrino masses '' .",
    "the idea is that of starting with a lagrangian invariant under @xmath4 , in which after @xmath4 and electroweak symmetry breaking one mechanism accounts for the tbm - form while the deviations are provided by the other mechanism ( rather than by nlo corrections ) , with both contributions to the neutrino mass matrix entering at the same order , generically lo .",
    "this type of scenario was investigated before in the context of bi - maximal mixing @xcite and also in the case of tbm @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was explored in models with extra dimensions . more recently in @xcite ,",
    "type - i seesaw @xcite was assumed to be responsible for the leading tbm - form and type - ii seesaw @xcite contributions introduced the deviations to tbm .    here",
    "we intend to show the feasibility of the whole idea under fairly general assumptions , in the sense that rather than assuming specific neutrino mass generating mechanisms we deal with a discussion based on lepton - number - violating effective operators .",
    "we identify the minimal @xmath0 representations which render this idea plausible by assuming that the lepton sector obeys an @xmath0 flavor symmetry similar to the altarelli - feruglio ( af ) model @xcite , where the charged lepton yukawa couplings hierarchies are dictated by a froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that within this context , if the non - zero reactor angle arises from `` hybrid neutrino masses '' the solar and the atmospheric angles are always within their experimental ranges , in contrast to the `` standard '' procedure involving nlo effective operators where  in general  this can not be guaranteed .",
    "more specifically , and in order to illustrate the general picture , we construct explicitly @xmath0-based ultraviolet ( uv ) completions akin to @xcite , with the leading tbm - form originating from type - i seesaw  but importantly the deviations arise from type - ii or type - iii @xcite .",
    "in addition to this and being uv complete with explicit messenger fields , our construction further differs from that in @xcite : rather than a flavon @xmath0 triplet with a certain assumed vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , we use a non - trivial @xmath0 singlet with a corresponding vev consistently explained by the alignment sector .",
    "the rest of this letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pert - tbm - nmm ] , by using effective lo lepton - number - breaking operators , we study the possible deviations which can emerge in @xmath0-inspired frameworks .",
    "[ sec : type - ii - seesaw ] discusses a viable uv completion based on type - i plus either type - ii or type - iii seesaw . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "if neutrino masses are generated by two different mechanisms , with one accounting for the tbm structure of the neutrino mass matrix and the other for the deviations required by experimental data , the full neutrino mass matrix can be written according to @xmath5 with the leading contribution @xmath6 being determined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 corresponds to the leptonic mixing matrix with mixing angles fixed according to their tbm values ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the perturbation matrix @xmath12 must produce a non - vanishing and sizable reactor angle while at the same time yielding not too large corrections to the other two mixing angles . at the model - independent level",
    "several conclusions can be drawn , in particular : a non - vanishing reactor angle requires the perturbation matrix to induce sizable deviations mainly in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 entries , and these deviations in turn imply departures of @xmath15 and @xmath16 from their tbm form , being more pronounced in the atmospheric sector @xcite .    in trying to keep our approach as model - independent as possible",
    ", we develop our analysis by considering first effective @xmath17 operators accounting for both @xmath6 and @xmath12 . but to study more in - depth the viability of this framework where deviations from the tbm form arise from a separate mechanism , one must consider particular models where one may have the structure of @xmath12 determined by the underlying flavor symmetry . due to this , we assume a supersymmetric implementation of an @xmath0 lepton flavor symmetry ( given its relative simplicity ) @xcite .    in this context",
    ", getting @xmath6 requires , in addition to the standard model superfields transforming non - trivially under @xmath0 , the presence of new superfields ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : af - model - cassign ] , where in contrast to the original model in @xcite we have considered @xmath1 transformations and the possibility of the `` up - type '' higgs transforming non - trivially under @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the hypercharge and @xmath19 the r - symmetry , the so - called alignment superfields ( with @xmath19 assignment @xmath20 , denoted by superscript @xmath21 ) will lead to specific non - vanishing vevs for the so - called flavons ( with @xmath19 assignment @xmath21 ) .",
    "we briefly review the relevant superpotential terms . in the following",
    ", curly brackets denote the contraction of @xmath0 triplets into @xmath0 singlets , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and similarly for the 3-triplet contractions .",
    "the charged lepton yukawa couplings have hierarchical masses due to the fn mechanism @xcite : the @xmath25 flavor symmetry shown in tab .  [",
    "tab : af - model - cassign ] is broken by @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the fn suppression factors and @xmath29 the fn cutoff scale .",
    "the superpotential for the neutrinos is @xmath30 the lo tbm comes from the flavon vevs : @xmath31 provided by the alignment superpotential : @xmath32    these superpotential terms are invariant under all the symmetries in table [ tab : af - model - cassign ] .",
    "the presence of the @xmath1 symmetry implies that charged lepton and neutrino masses arise from two independent sets of fields , while the @xmath19 separates the superfields as those that correspond to fermions of the standard model ( first four columns in tab .",
    "[ tab : af - model - cassign ] ) , alignment ( or `` driving '' ) fields ( last three columns in tab .",
    "[ tab : af - model - cassign ] ) , and symmetry breaking fields .",
    "after electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking the set of interactions in ( [ eq : neutral - lag ] ) , combined with the vacuum alignment in ( [ eq : vev - alignment ] ) and the appropriate @xmath0 group index contractions , yields for the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the parameters in the rh neutrino mass defined as @xmath35 in general this structure is maintained only at lo , unless a specific uv completion guarantees the absence of nlo contributions @xcite .",
    "the nlo contributions modify @xmath6 directly through a change in the neutrino terms adding to ( [ eq : neutral - lag ] ) or indirectly by shifting the vacuum alignment in  ( [ eq : vev - alignment ] ) . constraining the discussion to only this setup",
    ", this implies that @xmath36 . for values of @xmath37 of @xmath38 , these corrections can account for a non - vanishing reactor angle but at the same time imply deviations of the solar and atmospheric angle from their tbm values , often outside of their experimental ranges @xcite . for smaller @xmath37 , below @xmath39 ,",
    "the tbm structure is less affected .",
    "if additional ( @xmath0 ) flavons are present , they can allow additional lepton - number - breaking effective operators that deviate from @xmath6 .",
    "if the new operators are less suppressed than the the nlo operators of the `` original '' model , the deviations from tbm will be _ naturally _ dictated by the new contribution , which we denote as @xmath40 .",
    "this can happen if @xmath41 , e.g. if the nlo operators are forbidden by the uv completion .",
    "then @xmath42 must generate deviations consistent with data .",
    "given the lepton doublets transformation properties , three @xmath0 assignments for an extra flavon are possible : a triplet @xmath43 @xcite , a singlet @xmath44 or a singlet @xmath45 .",
    "for the triplet to produce a deviation in the tbm leading structure , the flavon vev should differ from that of @xmath46 in ( [ eq : vev - alignment ] ) , otherwise @xmath40 will just shift the parameter @xmath47 in ( [ eq : dirac - rhn - mm ] ) , keeping its tbm - form . if the new flavon is a trivial @xmath0 singlet , @xmath48 .",
    "] instead , with the new flavon transforming as @xmath44 or @xmath45 , a non - vanishing vev will be sufficient to produce deviations from tbm , so the non - trivial singlet choices are simpler .",
    "a minimal hybrid singlet - based af - inspired model will then consist of the af fields plus new flavons , namely @xmath49 and its corresponding `` driving '' field @xmath50 or @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "two conditions have to be fulfilled for the emerging scheme to be phenomenologically consistent : @xmath53 the tbm deviations induced by the new yukawa operators arising from the presence of the singlet should be consistent with data @xcite ; @xmath54 the new `` driving sector '' operators should lead to a non - vanishing singlet vev and at the same time not spoil the vev alignments ( [ eq : vev - alignment ] ) assuring the leading order tbm structure .",
    "we consider separately the two types of minimal @xmath0-based hybrid models : with @xmath51 or with @xmath49 .",
    "the respective dimension six effective operators would be : @xmath55 @xmath1 invariance then fixes the charge of the new flavon to match that of the af trivial singlet flavon @xmath56 .",
    "such a charge assignment typically renders the hybrid scheme ineffective due to unavoidable additional invariants .",
    "specifically , if some @xmath57 coupling exists ( @xmath58 being a combination of fields belonging to the uv completed model , particularly @xmath0 invariants made of two triplets ) , @xmath1 invariance will also allow the coupling @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) .",
    "in other words , the @xmath1 equality implies that both operators , the one yielding tbm and the one responsible for the deviations , will stem from the same ( uv complete ) mechanism .",
    "this is certainly the case in the af - inspired models , where equal @xmath1 charges lead the @xmath56 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath49 ) to contribute through type - i seesaw .",
    "the conclusion is more general though : minimal hybridization will often require a distinct charge under some abelian symmetry , even though the assignments under the non - abelian symmetry are already distinct .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ hybridization statement_.    there is another argument supporting an even stronger _",
    "hybridization statement _ , and it has to do with the hybridization condition @xmath54 . in a specific uv completion of the af - inspired models , a mismatch between @xmath56 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath49 ) charges can be given by a sign mismatch ( where a charge of @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath62 under @xmath1 ) .",
    "such a mismatch avoids the coupling @xmath59 ( or @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , new terms at the `` driving sector '' level will be allowed , namely @xmath64 or the equivalent terms for @xmath49 .",
    "the first term destroys the @xmath65 alignment in ( [ eq : vev - alignment ] ) , while the second term spoils the @xmath66 alignment , and therefore any of them harming the lo tbm structure .",
    "a mismatch beyond just a sign flip is thus mandatory in the af - inspired models .",
    "this constraint applies in general to models where some flavons or alignment fields are neutral under the abelian symmetries .    at the effective level ,",
    "such a mismatch is possible only if @xmath56 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath49 ) participate in operators of different dimensionality .",
    "if one aims to argue that the hybrid structure accounts for the small tbm deviations it is desirable to have the deviations appear at higher order , the simplest cases are then @xmath67 where we have defined @xmath68 and have assumed that alignment superpotential leads to @xmath69 . note that with the deviations dictated by @xmath70 the @xmath1 charge of the non - trivial singlet flavon is @xmath71 , half the charge of @xmath56 .    in summary ,",
    "if the leading tbm - form of the neutrino mass matrix arises from this type of @xmath0 setup , the simplest lepton - number - breaking operators which can induce deviations from the tbm - form are determined by the presence of a flavon transforming as a non - trivial @xmath0 singlet @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , within this context , two minimal setups can be defined , namely @xmath72 assuming @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the relative size between the two terms becomes determined by @xmath75 , with the precise numerical ranges fixed by the requirement of having a mixing pattern compatible with neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "( left plot ) and @xmath76 ( right plot ) .",
    "the horizontal stripes indicate the @xmath77 allowed range for the atmospheric angle ( top stripe ) , solar angle ( middle stripe ) and reactor angle ( bottom stripe ) .",

    "thus , in order to check for the viability of the resulting models , one can diagonalize @xmath81 and see whether for the @xmath78 range where @xmath82 falls into its measured value the remaining two mixing angles are also within their experimental ranges . fig . [",

    "these results prove that as long as @xmath87\\times 10^{-2}\\,$ ]  ev , which implies @xmath88 , one is always able to obtain a mixing pattern consistent with data .",
    "more importantly , _ for the range where the reactor angle falls in its @xmath77 experimental range , the atmospheric and solar angles are also in the @xmath77 range_. this follows directly from implementing hybrid seesaw in the particular case of @xmath0 with non - trivial singlets , and compares favorably with the af model , where nlo contributions required to match the observed reactor angle do not necessarily imply that the solar and atmospheric angles are in agreement with data @xcite ( this is also the case for uv completions @xcite ) .",
    "the complex eigenvalues of the leading order tbm mass matrix in ( [ eq : dirac - rhn - mm ] ) are given by @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "they can be identified with the tbm eigenvectors @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , thus implying : @xmath95 therefore , at the tbm leading order level neutrino masses obey the following sum - rule : @xmath96    as has been discussed at length in @xcite , neutrino mass sum - rules add further constraints on neutrino observables : the lightest neutrino mass ( @xmath97 ) , the sum of absolute neutrino masses ( @xmath98 ) , the kinematic electron neutrino mass in @xmath99 decay ( @xmath100 ) and the effective mass for @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . in the presence of deviations from the tbm structure",
    "the sum - rules and corresponding constraints change . for",
    "deviations given by ( [ eq : type - ii - contributions - singlet - dp ] ) and ( [ eq : type - ii - contributions - singlet - p ] ) , the eigenvalues  at order @xmath78are instead given by @xmath103 which in turn imply the following modified sum - rule @xmath104 in @xcite this type of deviation from the sum rule was parametrized as @xmath105 this means that the results in @xcite can be directly translated to our case through the equality @xmath106 . with @xmath107  ev , as required by neutrino mixing data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbations ] , hatched ( orange ) vertical stripe ) , and fixing the heaviest neutrino mass to be @xmath108  ev one can estimate @xmath109 to be order @xmath110 .",
    "thus , once the hybrid contribution is added the lower limits on the neutrino observables will obey the constraints found in @xcite for @xmath111 , which  for completeness  we summarize in tab .",
    "[ tab : neutrino - obs ] .",
    "note that in the exact tbm limit the inverted spectrum is not allowed , but becomes possible once the deviations are added .",
    "given the viability of generating a non - vanishing reactor mixing angle from two different sets of @xmath17 effective operators , it is interesting to discuss uv complete realizations .",
    "for that aim we will have type - i seesaw responsible for the leading tbm - form while @xmath12 arises from type - ii ( assumed from now up to sec .",
    "[ sec : type - iii ] ) or type - iii seesaw ( assumed in sec . [ sec : type - iii ] ) .",
    "we will specialize to the case of the @xmath112 model , results for the @xmath113 model follow directly from what will be discussed below .",
    "getting @xmath6 from type - i seesaw requires the presence of rh neutrinos superfields ( @xmath114 ) , which we take to transform as @xmath0 triplets , @xmath43 .",
    "the seesaw yukawa couplings @xmath115 require the rh neutrinos to have a @xmath1 charge equal to @xmath71 , and this requirement in turn implies that the neutral sector flavons @xmath46 , @xmath56 and @xmath116 should have @xmath1 charges equal to @xmath117 , rather than as @xmath118 as they do when effective operators are used instead . with @xmath46 , @xmath56 and @xmath116 having this charge , the scalar potential terms in ( [ eq : scalar - potential ] ) require the neutral sector driving fields to have charges equal to @xmath119 .",

    "regardless of the mechanism responsible for neutrino masses , the neutrino mass matrix should have a leading tbm - form with small deviations accounting for a non - vanishing reactor mixing angle , as can be proved  in a model - independent fashion  with the aid of the eigenvector decomposition of the neutrino mass matrix combined with current neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",

    "<S> in terms of its eigenvector decomposition , the neutrino mass matrix ( in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal ) can be understood as originating from a tribimaximal dominant structure with small deviations , as demanded by data . </S>",
    "<S> if neutrino masses originate from at least two different mechanisms , referred to as `` hybrid neutrino masses '' , the experimentally observed structure naturally emerges provided one mechanism accounts for the dominant tribimaximal structure while the other is responsible for the deviations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the feasibility of this picture in a fairly model - independent way by using lepton - number - violating effective operators , whose structure we assume becomes dictated by an underlying @xmath0 flavor symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if a second mechanism is at work , the requirement of generating a reactor angle within its experimental range always fixes the solar and atmospheric angles in agreement with data , in contrast to the case where the deviations are induced by next - to - leading order effective operators . </S>",
    "<S> we prove this idea is viable by constructing an @xmath0-based ultraviolet completion , where the dominant tribimaximal structure arises from the type - i seesaw while the subleading contribution is determined by either type - ii or type - iii seesaw driven by a non - trivial @xmath0 singlet ( minimal hybrid model ) . after finding general criteria , we identify all the @xmath1 symmetries capable of producing such @xmath0-based minimal hybrid models .    </S>",
