    "bl lac objects are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterized by strong and rapidly variable continuum emission and polarization across the electromagnetic spectrum , strong compact flat spectrum radio emission and superluminal motion ( see kollgaard 1992 for general references ) .",
    "they share many properties with flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and are often grouped together as blazars .",
    "the clearest difference between them is that the latter have strong broad emission lines , while these are very weak or absent in bl lacs .",
    "blazar properties are usually explained by the beaming model ( blandford & rees 1978 ) , where the observed emission is dominated by a synchrotron emitting relativistically boosted jet oriented close to our line  of  sight .",
    "this model is supported by the fact that almost all blazars are strong and rapidly variable @xmath4ray sources ( von montigny 1995 ) .",
    "the beaming model implies the existence of a more numerous parent population of intrinsically identical objects but with their jet oriented at larger angles to our line  of  sight . in the current unified models for radio",
    " loud agn ( urry & padovani 1995 ) , bl lac objects are unified with low luminosity core  dominated ( f  r i ) radio galaxies ( rg ) seen nearly along the jet axis , while the high luminosity lobe  dominated ( f  r ii ) rgs represent the parents of fsrqs ( padovani & urry 1990 ; urry , padovani & stickel 1991 )",
    ". however , for potential problems in this simple unification , see urry & padovani ( 1995 ) . for a direct test of the unification model , we need to compare orientation  independent properties of bl lac objects with those of the parents , extended radio emission , host galaxies and environments .    considerable amount of optical imaging exists for relatively nearby ( z@xmath10.5 ) bl lac hosts ( abraham , mchardy & crawford 1991 ; stickel , fried & khr 1993 ; falomo 1996 ; wurtz 1996 ; falomo 1997b ; jannuzi , yanny & impey 1997 ) .",
    "the host galaxies of nearby bl lacs have turned out to be predominantly giant ellipticals with similar magnitude to f ",
    "r i rgs , although there appear to be some cases of disk dominated host galaxies ( mchardy 1991 ; abraham 1991 ; stocke , wurtz & perlman 1995 , but see contradicting views by romanishin 1992 ; stickel 1993 ; falomo 1997a ) .",
    "the extended radio power and optical environments of bl lacs are also consistent with those of f ",
    "r i rgs , but suggest a contribution to the parent population from f ",
    "r ii rgs ( kollgaard 1992 ; pesce , falomo & treves 1995 ; wurtz 1997 ) .",
    "very little near  infrared ( nir ) imaging exists on bl lac objects .",
    "however , nir wavelengths may offer some advantages .",
    "optical emission from bl lacs is often dominated by the nuclear source , while the luminosity of the massive old stellar population peaks in the nir .",
    "this leads to a better contrast of the nebulosity with respect to the nuclear source at these wavelengths .",
    "one also needs to apply much lower k  correction in the nir than in the optical . in this paper",
    "we present nir h  band ( 1.65 @xmath0 m ) images of 11 bl lac objects and compare the nir host properties with those of rgs and fsrqs .",
    "the bl lacs were observed during our project to study the host galaxies of a complete sample of fsrqs ( kotilainen , falomo & scarpa 1998 ; hereafter kfs98 ) and thus they do not satisfy any criteria of completeness .",
    "however , all the low redshift bl lacs in this sample have previously been imaged in the optical by us .",
    "the same procedure of analysis was performed on the nir and optical datasets , thus allowing us to investigate the r ",
    "h colour of the host galaxies in a homogeneous manner .",
    "properties of the observed objects are given in table 1 .",
    "in section 2 , we briefly describe the observations , data reduction and the method of the analysis and refer the reader to a more thorough discussion given in kfs98 .",

    "distant targets , on the other hand , were always kept in the field by shifting them across the array .",
    "individual exposures were coadded to achieve the final integration time ( see table 1 ) .",
    "data reduction consisted of correction for bad pixels by interpolating across neighboring pixels , sky subtraction using a median averaged sky frame ( for nearby sources ) or a median averaged frame of all observations ( for distant sources ) , flat - fielding , and combination of images of the same target .",
    "standard stars from the list of landolt ( 1992 ) were used for photometric calibration , for which we estimate an accuracy of @xmath110.1 mag .",
    "correction was applied to the host galaxy magnitudes following the method of neugebauer ( 1985 ) .",
    "the size of this correction is insignificant at low redshift in the h filter ( m(h ) = 0.01 at z = 0.2 ) .",
    "no k  correction was applied to the nuclear component , assumed to have a power - law spectrum ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 @xmath111 .",
    "azimuthally averaged radial luminosity profile was extracted for each object and stars in the frames down to surface brightness of @xmath0(h ) = 2223 mag arcsec@xmath14 . only for few objects ,",
    "bright stars were present in the field for straightforward psf determination .",
    "for most sources , the core of the psf was derived from faint field stars , while the wing was extrapolated using a suitable moffat ( 1969 ) function obtained from fitting bright stars in other frames of similar seeing during the same night .",
    "we stress that this extrapolation does not affect the fit for the low redshift , often host  dominated bl lacs in our sample .",
    "the luminosity profiles were fitted into point source and galaxy components by an iterative least - squares fit to the observed profile . for low redshift objects , we attempted both elliptical ( de vaucouleurs law ) and exponential disc models to represent the galaxy .",
    "however , consistently with results from optical images , in no case did the disc model give a better fit than the elliptical one for the observed sources .",
    "for higher redshift objects , data quality does not allow one to discriminate between the morphologies and for them the elliptical model was assumed .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of the derived host galaxy magnitudes to be @xmath11@xmath20.3 mag .",
    "in fig . 1 we show the h band contour plots of all the bl lacs , after smoothing the images with a gaussian filter of @xmath15 = 1 px .",
    "we are able to clearly detect the host galaxy in all the bl lacs at low redshift ( z@xmath10.24 ) . in the unresolved cases ,",
    "the redshift is either high ( pks 1538 + 14 ; z = 0.605 , pks 0537441 ; z = 0.896 ) or unknown but probably high ( z@xmath60.5 ; pks 0048097 and z@xmath60.557 ; pks 0118272 ) .",

    "the similarity of the colours and colour gradients of bl lac hosts to those of normal elliptical galaxies then indicates that the nuclear activity has only marginal effect , if any , on the overall properties of the host galaxy .",
    "for example , galaxy interactions and mergers , often invoked to explain the bl lac phenomenon and agn in general ( heckman 1990 ) , do not seem to induce strong recent star formation in the bl lac hosts .",
    "this is perhaps due to a very low gas density in the host and/or in the interacting galaxy .",

    "all magnitudes were transformed into our adopted cosmology and into the h band .",
    "based on the similarity of the bl lac host galaxies to giant ellipticals ( see discussion above ) , the transformation of published magnitudes to the h band was obtained assuming the following colours of giant ellipticals , computed from the literature values given in table 4 : v  h = 3.1 , r ",

    "the lack of direct comparison sample of f - r i rgs , however , prevents us from discussing the issue of the parent population of bl lac objects further .    since bl lacs share many properties ( variability and polarization ) with fsrqs , it is interesting to compare the host properties of these two types of blazars .",

    "moreover , given the large difference of redshift between the bl lac and fsrq samples , it is also possible that the @xmath110.5 mag difference in host luminosity is due to cosmological evolution in the stellar population of an elliptical galaxy that makes it fade by @xmath110.8 mag between z@xmath111 and z@xmath110 ( models by bressan 1994 ) . indeed ,",
    "there is increasing observational evidence for significant evolution in the colours and luminosity of early  type galaxies ( aragon - salamanca 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the present data suggests that bl lac hosts are less luminous than those of fsrqs but , given the limits described above , additional homogeneous observations of bl lacs and fsrqs are needed to reach a firm conclusion .",
    "the average absolute magnitude of the fitted nuclear component for the clearly resolved bl lacs is m(h ) = 25.7@xmath21.7 . on the other hand , the fsrqs have much brighter nuclear component ( m(h ) = 29.7@xmath20.8 ; kfs98 ) .",
    "this difference in the strength of the nuclear component is also more evident considering the nucleus / galaxy luminosity ratio l(nuc)/l(gal ) in table 2 .",
    "none of the low redshift bl lacs ( or the rgs from taylor 1996 ) have l(nuc)/l(gal)@xmath610 , whereas about half of the fsrqs are above this limit ( kfs98 ) . from figs . 5 and 6 it is clear that the host galaxies of the various samples considered here are not dramatically different in intrinsic luminosity , especially if cosmological evolution is taken into account .",
    "therefore , this difference suggests that fsrqs exhibit a nuclear component which is systematically brighter than that of the low redshift bl lac objects , possibly due to either intrinsically higher luminosity or a larger doppler beaming factor . while this result disagrees with the current unified models of agn , further observations of larger and unbiased samples of bl lacs and fsrqs",
    "are needed to elucidate this point .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a near  infrared imaging study of a sample of 11 bl lac objects , for most of which the host galaxy is clearly resolved .",
    "consistently with what is found in optical studies , we find that the host galaxies of low redshift bl lacs are large ( average bulge scale length r(e ) = 8.8@xmath29.9 kpc ) and luminous ( average m(h ) = 25.8@xmath20.5 ) ; they are more luminous than l@xmath20 galaxies ( by @xmath111 mag ) but of similar luminosity to or slightly fainter than the brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "our nir study was able for the first time to address the issue of the optical ",
    "nir colour of bl lac host galaxies .",
    "the average r ",
    "h colour and colour gradient of the bl lac hosts are consistent with those of non - active early - type galaxies , suggesting that the nuclear activity does not have much effect on the star formation history of the host galaxies .",
    "the nucleus  to  galaxy ratio of bl lacs is similar to that found in low redshift rgs and consistent with what found in previous optical studies of bl lacs .",
    "however , it is smaller that that found for the higher redshift fsrqs ( kfs98 ) , suggesting there is a difference in the intrinsic brightness of the nuclear source or in the doppler beaming factor between the two types of blazars .",
    "we finally encourage a systematic nir multiwavelength study of a large , well defined sample of bl lac objects and their immediate environments with the new generation large nir arrays .",
