    "evidence for the incidence of nonextensive dynamical properties at critical attractors in low dimensional nonlinear maps has accumulated and advanced over the last few years ; specially with regards to the onset of chaos in logistic maps - the feigenbaum attractor @xcite , and at the accompanying pitchfork and tangent bifurcations @xcite . the more general chaotic attractors with positive lyapunov coefficients have full - grown phase - space ergodic and mixing properties , and their dynamics is compatible with the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics . as a difference",
    ", critical attractors have vanishing lyapunov coefficients , exhibit memory - retentive nonmixing properties , and are therefore to be considered outside bg statistics .    naturally , some basic questions about the understanding of the dynamics at critical attractors are of current interest .",
    "we mention the following : why do the anomalous sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath1 and its matching pesin identity obey the expressions suggested by the nonextensive formalism ?",
    "how does the value of the entropic index @xmath0 arise ? or is there a preferred set of @xmath0 values ? does this index , or indexes , point to some specific observable properties at the critical attractor ?    from a broader point of view",
    "it is of interest to know if the anomalous dynamics found for critical attractors bears some correlation with the dynamical behavior at extremal or transitional states in systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "two specific suggestions have been recently advanced , in one case the dynamics at the onset of chaos has been demonstrated to be closely analogous to the glassy dynamics observed in supercooled molecular liquids @xcite , and in the second case the dynamics at the tangent bifurcation has been shown to be related to that at thermal critical states @xcite .    with regard to the above comments here we briefly recount the following developments :    \\i ) the finding @xcite that the dynamics at the onset of chaos is made up of an infinite family of mori s @xmath0-phase transitions @xcite , each associated to orbits that have common starting and finishing positions located at specific regions of the attractor .",
    "every one of these transitions is related to a discontinuity in the @xmath2 function of diameter ratios @xcite , and this in turn implies a @xmath0 -exponential @xmath1 and a spectrum of @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients equal to the tsallis rate of entropy production for each set of attractor regions .",
    "the transitions come in pairs with conjugate indexes @xmath0 and @xmath3 , as these correspond to switching starting and finishing orbital positions .",
    "the amplitude of the discontinuities in @xmath2 diminishes rapidly and consideration only of its dominant one , associated to the most crowded and sparse regions of the attractor , provides a very reasonable description of the dynamics , consistent with that found in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) the realization @xcite that the dynamics at the noise - perturbed edge of chaos in logistic maps is analogous to that observed in supercooled liquids close to vitrification .",
    "four major features of glassy dynamics in structural glass formers , two - step relaxation , aging , a relationship between relaxation time and configurational entropy , and evolution from diffusive to subdiffusive behavior and finally arrest , are shown to be displayed by the properties of orbits with vanishing lyapunov coefficient .",
    "the previously known properties in control - parameter space of the noise - induced bifurcation gap @xcite play a central role in determining the characteristics of dynamical relaxation at the chaos threshold .",
    "the dynamics at the chaos threshold @xmath4 of the @xmath5-logistic map @xmath6 has been analyzed recently @xcite . the orbit with initial condition @xmath7 ( or equivalently , @xmath8 )",
    "consists of positions ordered as intertwined power laws that asymptotically reproduce the entire period - doubling cascade that occurs for @xmath9 .",
    "this orbit is the last of the so - called superstable periodic orbits at @xmath10 @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite , a superstable orbit of period @xmath13 .",
    "there , the ordinary lyapunov coefficient @xmath14 vanishes and instead a spectrum of @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients @xmath15 develops . this spectrum originally studied in refs .",
    "@xcite when @xmath16 , has been shown @xcite to be associated to a sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath1 ( defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the initial separation of two orbits and @xmath19 that at time @xmath20 ) that obeys the @xmath0-exponential form @xmath21\\equiv [ 1-(q-1)\\lambda _ { q}(x_{0})\\ t]^{-1/q-1}\\ ] ] suggested by the tsallis statistics .",
    "notably , the appearance of a specific value for the @xmath0 index ( and actually also that for its conjugate value @xmath22 ) works out @xcite to be due to the occurrence of mori s @xmath0-phase transitions @xcite between local attractor structures at @xmath23 .",

    "1 , the absolute values for the positions @xmath24 of the trajectory with @xmath25 at time - shifted @xmath26 have a structure consisting of subsequences with a common power - law decay of the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath29 is the feigenbaum universal constant that measures the period - doubling amplification of iterate positions .",
    "that is , the attractor can be decomposed into position subsequences generated by the time subsequences @xmath30 , each obtained by proceeding through @xmath31 for a fixed value of @xmath32 .",

    "for each discontinuity of @xmath48 the sensitivity can be written in the forms @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] , @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this result reflects the multi - region nature of the multifractal attractor and the memory retention of these regions in the dynamics .",
    "the pair of @xmath0-exponentials correspond to a departing position in one region and arrival at a different region and vice versa , the trajectories expand in one sense and contract in the other . the largest discontinuity of @xmath48 at @xmath53",
    "is associated to trajectories that start and finish at the most crowded ( @xmath54 ) and the most sparse ( @xmath55 ) regions of the attractor . in this case one",
    "obtains @xmath56 the positive branch of the lyapunov spectrum , when the trajectories start at @xmath57 and finish at @xmath55 . by inverting the situation one obtains @xmath58 the negative branch of the lyapunov spectrum",
    "notice that @xmath59 .",
    "so , when considering these two dominant families of orbits all the @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients appear associated to only two specific values of the tsallis index , @xmath0 and @xmath3 .    _",
    "@xmath0_-phase transitions_. as a function of the running variable @xmath60 the @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients become a function @xmath61 with two steps located at @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this manner contact can be established with the formalism developed by mori and coworkers @xcite and the @xmath0-phase transition obtained in refs .",
    "the step function for @xmath61 can be integrated to obtain the spectrum @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and its legendre transform @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , the dynamic counterparts of the renyi dimensions @xmath68 and the spectrum @xmath69 that characterize the geometry of the attractor .",

    "was numerically determined @xcite . according to @xmath66 above we obtain a conjugate pair of @xmath0-phase transitions that correspond to trajectories linking two regions of the attractor , the most crowded and most sparse .",

    "_ generalized pesin identity_. ensembles of trajectories with starting points close to the attractor point @xmath74 expand in such a way that a uniform distribution of initial conditions remains uniform for all later times @xmath20 . as a consequence of this we established @xcite the identity of the rate of entropy production @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath0-generalized rate of entropy production @xmath77 is defined via @xmath78 , @xmath20 large , where @xmath79 is the tsallis entropy , @xmath80 is the trajectories distribution , and where @xmath81 is the inverse of @xmath82 .",
    "see figs . 2 and 3 in ref .",
    "we describe now the effect of additive noise in the dynamics at the onset of chaos .",
    "the logistic map @xmath5 @xmath83 reads now @xmath84    where @xmath85 is gaussian - distributed with average @xmath86 , and @xmath2 is the noise intensity .",
    "for @xmath87 the noise fluctuations wipe the fine features of the periodic attractors as these widen into bands similar to those in the chaotic attractors , nevertheless there remains a well - defined transition to chaos at @xmath88 where the lyapunov exponent @xmath14 changes sign .",
    "the period doubling of bands ends at a finite maximum period @xmath89 as @xmath90 and then decreases at the other side of the transition .",
    "this effect displays scaling features and is referred to as the bifurcation gap @xcite .",
    "when @xmath87 the trajectories visit sequentially a set of @xmath91 disjoint bands or segments leading to a cycle , but the behavior inside each band is fully chaotic .",
    "these trajectories represent ergodic states as the accessible positions have a fractal dimension equal to the dimension of phase space .",
    "when @xmath92 the trajectories correspond to a nonergodic state , since as @xmath93 the positions form only a cantor set of fractal dimension @xmath94 .",
    "thus the removal of the noise @xmath95 leads to an ergodic to nonergodic transition in the map .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite when @xmath96 there is a crossover or relaxation time @xmath97 , @xmath98 , between two different time evolution regimes .",
    "this crossover occurs when the noise fluctuations begin suppressing the fine structure of the attractor as displayed by the superstable orbit with @xmath7 described previously .",
    "for @xmath99 the fluctuations are smaller than the distances between the neighboring subsequence positions of the @xmath7 orbit at @xmath100 , and the iterate position with @xmath87 falls within a small band around the @xmath92 position for that @xmath101 .",
    "the bands for successive times do not overlap .",
    "time evolution follows a subsequence pattern close to that in the noiseless case .",
    "when @xmath102 the width of the noise - generated band reached at time @xmath103 matches the distance between adjacent positions , and this implies a cutoff in the progress along the position subsequences . at longer times @xmath104 the orbits no longer trace the precise period - doubling structure of the attractor .",
    "the iterates now follow increasingly chaotic trajectories as bands merge with time .",
    "this is the dynamical image - observed along the time evolution for the orbits of a single state @xmath88 - of the static bifurcation gap initially described in terms of the variation of the control parameter @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "_ two - step relaxation_. amongst the main dynamical properties displayed by supercooled liquids on approach to glass formation is the growth of a plateau , and for that reason a two - step process of relaxation , in the time evolution of two - time correlations @xcite .",
    "this consists of a primary power - law decay in time difference @xmath106 ( so - called @xmath107 relaxation ) that leads into the plateau , the duration @xmath108 of which diverges also as a power law of the difference @xmath109 as the temperature @xmath110 decreases to a glass temperature @xmath111 .",
    "after @xmath112 there is a secondary power law decay ( so - called @xmath113 relaxation ) away from the plateau @xcite . in fig .",
