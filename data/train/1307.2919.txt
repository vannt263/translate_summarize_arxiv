    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite can be interpreted by introducing in the cosmological model a negative pressure component , termed `` dark energy '' .",
    "the simplest dark energy candidate is a cosmological constant @xmath0 , having constant equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "together with a pressureless cold dark matter component ( cdm ) , this constitutes the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "although this `` concordance model '' is in very good agreement with a variety of cosmological observations @xcite , different candidates of dark energy can not be discarded yet .",
    "moreover , the basic cosmological constant scenario has two difficulties known as `` fine - tuning '' and cosmic coincidence problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to overcome these problems alternative candidates for the dark energy",
    "have been proposed , such as the quintessence @xcite that allows the possibility of a time - dependent equation of state @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will assume a redshift dependent equation of state for the dark energy ,    @xmath3    and adopt the well - known chevalier - plarsky - linder parametrization @xcite    @xmath4    cosmological observation can in principle be used to constrain the neutrinos masses .",
    "it was shown by neutrino oscillation experiments that neutrinos have non - zero masses ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , these experiments can only constrain the neutrinos mass - square differences and not their individual values ( for a review in neutrino masses see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cosmological probes are most sensitive to the total neutrino masses , @xmath5 . using cmb radiation data only , from planck satellite , an upper limit to @xmath5 of 0.933 ev at 95% c.l",
    "was found @xcite .",
    "@xmath6    however , the dark energy equation of state and the neutrinos total mass parameters are degenerated ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . some work has already been done to constrain both parameters simultaneously in a few dark energy scenarios , such as for models with a constant and a time - varying equations of state @xcite .    our goal is to forecast the constraint in total mass of neutrinos in a time evolving dark energy model , using cmb temperature and polarization power spectrum from the planck satellite experimental setup ( including also cmb lensing information ) , as well as the large - scale matter distribution that can be observed by euclid survey .",
    "we emphasize the usage of planck cmb polarization information since its temperature data has been recently released @xcite .",
    "we assume a geometrically flat @xmath0cdm model with two massive neutrinos with identical mass and one massless in a inverted hierarchy mass splitting , being @xmath7 = 0.125 ev for each massive neutrino .",
    "the fiducial parameters are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we normalize the cmb power spectra to cobe . for similar approaches see @xcite .",

    "[ method ] , we briefly review the fisher information matrix formalism for the cmb ( with and without lensing information ) and for a galaxy survey .",

    "a small effect that can be observed in cmb power spectrum regards the deflection of photons , during their travel between the last scattering surface and the observer , by gravitational potentials @xmath13 due to clusters of galaxies .",
    "@xcite detected the cmb lensing signal for the first time by cross correlating wmap data to radio galaxy counts in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) .",
    "recently , the detection of the gravitational lensing using cmb temperature maps alone and the measurement of the power spectrum of the projected gravitational potential were done using the atacama cosmology telescope and the south pole telescope @xcite .    the lensing potential is defined as :    @xmath14    being @xmath15 the comoving distance and @xmath16 is the conformal time at which the photon was at position @xmath17 .",
    "the lensing effect remaps the temperature and polarization fields as    @xmath18    @xmath19 ( \\textbf{\\^n } )   = [ q+ iu ] ( \\textbf{\\^n}+ d).\\ ] ]    where in the case of the temperature field , the temperature t of the lensed cmb in a direction * n * is equal to the unlensed cmb in a different direction * n*. both these directions , * n * and * n * , differ by the deflection angle @xmath20 . to first order ,",
    "the deflection angle is simply the lensing potential gradient , @xmath21 . in the same way",
    ", the effect of lensing in cmb polarization is written in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( for a review in cmb polarization theory , see @xcite ) :    cmb lensing has important quantitative contributions that should be taken into account , therefore a lot of work has been done to cmb lensing reconstruction techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the camb software package @xcite to obtain the numerical lensed and unlensed power spectra ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) for our cosmological model with @xmath26 .",
    "we then use this predictions to forecast how cmb lensing information will help us constraining our model .",
    "we apply the fisher information matrix formalism to a planck - like experiment @xcite , considering both temperature and polarization for the lensend and unlensed cmb spectrum , and to an experiment such as the future euclid survey .",
    "we forecast the dark energy and the massive neutrinos parameters in our fiducial model .",
    "in addition , we check the impact of cmb lensing information on the constraints of the mentioned parameters in a nearly perfect cmb experiment .",
    "the fisher information matrix for the cmb temperature anisotropy and polarization is given by @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the power in the @xmath29th multipole , @xmath30 stands for @xmath31 ( temperature ) , @xmath32 ( e - mode polarization ) , @xmath33 ( b - mode polarization ) and @xmath34 ( temperature and e - mode polarization cross - correlation ) . we will not include primordial b - modes in the analysis since the measurement of the primordial @xmath35 by planck is expected to be noise dominated .",

    "for the lensed case we performed a correction in the covariance matrix elements taking into consideration the power spectrum of the deflection angle and its cross correlation with temperature and e - polarization , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we used the same procedure introduced in @xcite to obtain the covariance matrix elements using the new information of @xmath38 power spectrum ( see appendix section [ elements of the lensed covariance matrix ] ) .",
    "we also change in this case the unlensed cmb power spectra , @xmath39 , for the lensed ones , @xmath40 .",
