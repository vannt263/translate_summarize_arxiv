    "manipulating electron spins by an external electric field is a central issue in the realization of spintronics on the basis of solid - state materials  @xcite as it is important for quantum computing and information processing  @xcite . in the experiment by kato et al .",
    "@xcite electron spins are manipulated by means of the voltage - controlled g - tensor modulation technique which is applicable for materials with small g - tensor merely .",
    "recently , a mechanism called electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) was proposed to investigate spin manipulating for electrons in a parabolic quantum well  @xcite .",
    "an in - plane or a perpendicular electric field was shown to efficiently manipulate the spin for electrons in quantum wells . in that mechanism a tilted magnetic field is required but small g - tensor is not necessary .",
    "it has been recognized recently that a strain - induced spin splitting is able to effectively manipulate electron spins without magnetic fields , which provides an alternative route , called strain engineering , for solid - state spin manipulation . for example , it has been employed to control electron - spin precession  @xcite in zinc - blende structure semiconductors and to tune the spin coherence with a significant enhancement of the spin dephasing time  @xcite . in semiconductor epilayers , the effect of the strain on electron - spin transport  @xcite and that of uniaxial tensile strain on spin coherence  @xcite have also been carried out in recent experiments .",
    "the types of strain - induced spin splittings in strained bulk semiconductors were analyzed  @xcite theoretically , whereas , it is not very clear so far that which type of spin splitting ( i.e. , rashba - type or dresselhuas - type ) produced by the strain  @xcite plays an important role in manipulating electron spins .",
    "since the spin manipulating in terms of strain is easily realizable in practical devices , it will be useful to exhibit the type of strain - induced spin splitting .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the efficiency of spin manipulation for electrons can be enhanced through adjusting the strain strength of the semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "the effect combining intrinsic and strain - induced spin splitting varies for different systems .",
    "we propose a method to identify whether the spin splitting induced by strain is of dresselhuas - type or rashba - type .",

    "the combining effects of intrinsic and strain - induced spin splitting in some other kind of semiconductor quantum wells are also studied .",
    "a summary of our main conclusion is given in the last section .",
    "for electron gases in quantum wells or two - dimensional heterostructures of certain semiconductors , there exist two intrinsic spin - orbit couplings called dresselhaus and rashba couplings that arise from the bulk - inversion asymmetry or the structure - inversion asymmetry of the material , respectively .",
    "the dresselhaus type spin - orbit interaction can be obtained by averaging the corresponding bulk expression over the motion relevant to the confined degree of freedom  @xcite .",

    "<S> the effect combining intrinsic and strain - induced spin splitting varies for different systems , which provides an alternative route to understand the experimental phenomena brought in by the strain . </S>",
    "<S> the types of spin splittings caused by strain are suggested to be distinguished by the measurement of the electron - dipole - spin - resonance intensity through changing the direction of the @xmath0 electric field in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane of the quantum well and tuning the strain strengths . </S>"
