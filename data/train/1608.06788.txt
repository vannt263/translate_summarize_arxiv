    "over the past decades first - principles simulation methods have undergone a fantastic transformation , from a rather specialized technique reserved to a few groups to a standard and powerful tool accessible to any research team in the world . in particular , methods based on efficient schemes like density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite make it possible to run predictive simulations of many materials and systems @xcite .",
    "however , because of the finite computer power , dft studies are still limited to relatively small simulation boxes of a few hundreds of atoms ; further , except in the simplest of cases , computing statistical averages in realistic conditions is all but impossible .",
    "these limitations can be partly overcome by introducing effective models , with parameters computed from first principles , that permit faster and larger - scale calculations ( e.g. , statistical or dynamical , including thousands of atoms ) while retaining , to some extent , first - principles predictive power and accuracy @xcite . in the following we refer to such approaches as _ second - principles _ methods , adopting the terminology coined in ref .  .",
    "while progress in second - principles simulations has been impressive , this is still an emerging field , and the present situation is somewhat comparable to that of dft methods about three decades ago . the effective models and corresponding simulation tools are reasonably well established in some particular contexts , as e.g. for the study of proteins and other biological systems @xcite .",
    "however , we are still far from having general tools that permit a non - specialist to tackle a new problem .",
    "the current challenge is to bring the second - principles techniques to the level that dft simulation has reached .",
    "this is a daunting endeavor , much complicated by the fact that , by their own nature , different second - principles methods may rely on utterly diverse approximations .",
    "even if we restrict ourselves to atomistic schemes , we can distinguish between approaches that treat explicitly both atoms and electrons , and those in which only the atoms are retained in the description . among the latter ,",
    "we can find a wealth of options to handle the interatomic interactions , ranging from physically or chemically motivated models ( which range from the very simple  as the lennard - jones @xcite or bond - valence @xcite potentials  to the quite complex  as e.g. the so - called _ reaxff _ force fields @xcite ) to abstract mathematical approaches ( e.g. , those based on neural networks @xcite ) .",
    "different schemes present different strengths and weaknesses , and adapt better to different problems .",
    "for example , a suitable method to tackle phenomena that involve formation and breaking of chemical bonds ( e.g. , reaxff ) may not be the most appropriate to handle relatively simpler situations ( e.g. , those in which the bonding topology is preserved ) that may nevertheless require a high quantitative accuracy .",
    "here we focus on the latter category , i.e. , on cases in which an underlying lattice of chemical bonds can be assumed to remain essentially unperturbed throughout the simulation .",
    "while this _ constant - topology _ condition may look restrictive at first , there are many all - important properties that are perfectly compatible with it , including most lattice - dynamical phenomena , lattice thermal transport , dielectric and piezoelectric responses , and even structural phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes .",
    "wojde  _ et al_. @xcite took advantage of this constant - topology assumption to introduce simple and general polynomic potentials that describe the dependence of the energy  written as a taylor series around a suitable reference structure  on arbitrary ( though relatively small ) atomic distortions . indeed , in ref .",
    "some of us showed that such potentials provide a very flexible framework to fit accurately a training set of first - principles data .",
    "in particular , this approach allowed us to resolve the temperature - driven phase transitions of prototypical ferroelectric ( pbtio@xmath0 or pto ) and ferroelastic ( srtio@xmath0 or sto ) perovskite oxides @xcite ; further , it has allowed us to discover effects  ranging from novel structural phases under elastic constraints @xcite , to the occurrence of ferroelectric phase transitions within the ferroelectric domain walls of pto @xcite , or the negative - capacitance behavior of the pto layers of pto / sto superlattices @xcite  that had been essentially missed by previous effective models or direct dft simulations .",
    "hence , the methods of ref .",
    "have amply proven their usefulness and deserve further development .",
    "in this article we report our recent work based on the approach of ref .  , and introduce key developments in the way in which the models are constructed .",
    "the original work @xcite was based on a somewhat primitive ( perfectly standard ) algorithm that required us to choose the interaction terms of the model before fitting the parameters to a training set of dft data ; then , the fitting process involved successive ( and computationally costly ) constrained optimizations based on the minimization of non - linear goal functions .",
    "this scheme is good enough to produce useful models , but it is far from optimal . in particular , it does not take advantage of some unique features of our potentials that permit a far more efficient and powerful approach .    here",
    "we introduce a model - construction procedure that automatically identifies the most relevant coupling terms and computes the corresponding parameters .",
    "the most important terms are selected from a pool that may be defined to include virtually all possible interatomic interactions , of the order of hundreds in the applications considered in this work .",
    "our scheme is designed to produce _ a family _ of models of increasing complexity and accuracy ; thus , it makes it possible to choose the potential better suited to specific investigations .",
    "( naturally , the computational burden of the ensuing statistical or dynamical simulations grows with the complexity or size of the potential . )",
    "such an exhaustive model - construction procedure relies on a very fast and efficient algorithm for the calculation of the model parameters : in essence , we recast the usual ( costly and cumbersome ) optimization problem into one that involves solving ( almost instantaneously ) a system of linear equations .",
    "this critical step is possible thanks to a distinct feature of our polynomial models , namely , that the energy depends linearly on the parameters to be fitted .",
    "thus , in summary , our new method makes it possible to obtain models of exceedingly high accuracy in a fast and robust way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the formalism behind the new model - construction scheme , and also address issues concerning cross - validation and energy boundedness . in section",
    "iii we describe the construction of models for sto , a challenging material to test our method .",
    "different possibilities to construct a training set and fit the model parameters , as well as other practical aspects , are discussed in some detail . finally , in section  iv we summarize our work .",
    "in this section we describe our approach in a material - independent way .",
    "first we review the model - potential scheme of ref .  , recalling the basic formulas and notation .",
    "then we describe our present strategy for an automatic model construction , which takes advantage of the linearity of the potential with respect to the fitting parameters .",
    "finally , we introduce the problem of cross - validating the models , and also mention briefly the question of how to obtain potential energies that are bounded from below ; these practical issues will be better explained with an example in section  [ sec : application ] .      the models proposed by wojde  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can be described as a taylor series of the energy , around a certain reference structure ( rs ) , as a function of atomic displacements ( @xmath1 ) and strains ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is convenient to split the energy @xmath3 in three parts : @xmath4 where the subscripts `` p '' , `` s '' and `` sp '' stand for `` phonon '' , `` strain '' , and `` strain - phonon '' , respectively , and @xmath5 is the energy of the reference configuration . we assume the typical case in which the rs is a critical point of the pes , so that the first - order terms of the taylor series vanish .",
    "further , following ref .  , we write the energy in terms of displacement differences , so that our potential is explicitly compliant with the acoustic sum rule at all orders of the expansion .",
    "using latin letters to label the atoms in our material and greek letters to label cartesian coordinates , we can write the following general expression for @xmath6 :    @xmath7    where the @xmath8 tensors can be related with the @xmath9-th - derivatives of the energy , @xmath10 by expanding the displacement - difference products in eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) .",
    "analogously , we write the strain - phonon term as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the coupling tensor of order @xmath13 in strain and @xmath9 in the atomic displacements , and we use latin letters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc . ) to label strain components in voigt notation @xcite . finally we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bare elastic tensor of order @xmath13 .",
    "note that when working with insulators ( as in the example that will be described below ) , it is convenient to further split the interactions involving phonons in long - range ( dipole - dipole ) and short - range parts @xcite .",
    "the expression for the energy gives us access to all relevant lattice - dynamical quantities ; in particular , the forces on the atoms are given by @xmath18 for a certain @xmath19 configuration , while the stresses acting on the cell are @xmath20 note that , in order to match the usual definition of stress , this derivative needs to be computed under the condition that the _ relative _ positions of the atoms in the cell are kept constant .",
    "this is not direct in our scheme , as we work with absolute atomic displacements @xmath1 ; nevertheless , in practice this derivative calculation can be easily tackled by implementing an appropriate chain rule .",
    "there is a standard procedure to compute the parameters of a lattice - dynamical model , directly applicable to any potential type , including ours .",
    "the objective is to obtain a model that reproduces a _ training set _ ( ts ) of relevant lattice - dynamical and structural data . to quantify the model s accuracy in reproducing the ts ,",
    "one introduces a positively defined _ goal function _ ( gf ) , and turns the parameter fitting into a gf minimization problem .",
    "solving this problem is typically a hard task , as the gf is usually a high - dimension non - linear function of the free parameters , with an intricate multi - minima landscape associated to it .",
    "hence , a time - consuming numerical solution is mandatory in most cases .",
    "in essence , this is the approach some of us adopted in ref .  .",
    "here we show that , because of the particular form of our interaction potentials , we can make a judicious choice of gf that permits an analytic solution to the parameter - fitting problem .",
    "this is a drastic simplification that allows for very fast parameter calculations , which in turn makes it possible to implement an automatic procedure to identify the best model from essentially all possible couplings .      as it is obvious from the formulas above , our models are linear in the parameters to be fitted",
    "hence , we can formally write the energy of a model with @xmath21 parameters as @xmath22({\\bf u } , { \\boldsymbol \\eta } ) = \\sum_{\\lambda } \\theta_{\\lambda } t_{\\lambda}({\\bf u } , { \\boldsymbol \\eta } ) % + e^{\\rm fixed}({\\bf u } ,   { \\boldsymbol \\eta } ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : compactspld}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the set of free parameters and @xmath24 gathers the corresponding polynomial terms .",
    "note that for a given parameter @xmath25 , the corresponding @xmath26 includes _ all _ the symmetry - related terms ( i.e. , all products of atomic displacements and strains ) whose coupling is given by @xmath25 .",
    "we call @xmath26 a symmetry - adapted term ( sat ) , using the terminology of ref .  .",
    "for convenience , we also introduce an energy @xmath27 that gathers all the terms that do not need to be fitted .",
    "@xmath27 will typically include interactions that can be computed from first principles in a straightforward way , such as the harmonic bare elastic constants , the harmonic dipole - dipole couplings , etc .",
    "now we introduce a goal function @xmath28 $ ] that ( 1 ) is aimed at constructing models that give a good description of lattice - dynamical properties and ( 2 ) is a simple function of the model parameters .",
    "it is most natural and convenient to choose a gf of the form @xmath29 = \\frac{1}{m_{1 } } \\sum_{s\\tau } \\left ( f^{\\rm     ts}_{\\tau}(s)- f_{\\tau}[\\theta_{p}](s ) \\right)^{2 } + \\\\ % \\frac{1}{m_{2 } } \\sum_{s a } \\omega^{2}(s ) \\left ( \\sigma^{\\rm ts}_{a } ( s ) - \\sigma_{a}[\\theta_{p}](s ) \\right)^{2 } \\end{split } , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 labels the @xmath31 configurations in the ts and we have introduced the bijective mapping @xmath32 to alleviate the notation . note that we mark the target forces and stresses with a `` ts '' superscript , and we also indicate the parametric nature of the quantities derived from the model . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are normalization factors computed as the cardinal of the elements of the corresponding sums .",
    "@xmath35 is the factor that sheppard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed , in the context of nudged - elastic - band calculations , to properly weight forces and stresses ; it is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of atoms in the simulation cell and @xmath38 the cell volume for configuration @xmath30 .",
    "let us denote the sat derivatives with respect to atomic displacements and strains by @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "then , the forces and stresses computed as derivatives of eq .",
    "( [ eq : compactspld ] ) can be written as @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the corresponding derivatives of @xmath27 evaluated at configuration @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the gf can be rewritten as    @xmath45 = \\frac{1}{m_1 } \\sum_{s\\tau } \\left ( f^{\\rm     ts}_{\\tau}(s ) - \\sum_{\\lambda } \\theta_{\\lambda }   \\bar{f}_{\\lambda\\tau}(s ) - f^{\\rm fixed}_{\\tau}(s ) \\right)^{2 } % + \\frac{1}{m_2 } \\sum_{sa } \\omega^{2}(s ) \\left ( \\sigma^{\\rm    ts}_{a}(s ) - \\sum_{\\lambda } \\theta_{\\lambda } \\bar{\\sigma}_{\\lambda a}(s ) - \\sigma^{\\rm fixed}_{a}(s)\\right)^{2 }   \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the extrema of the goal function satisfy @xmath46/\\partial \\theta_{\\mu } = 0 $ ] @xmath47 .",
    "this translates into the set of conditions    @xmath48    for @xmath49 = 1 , ... ,",
    "this expression can be recast in the following , more convenient form    @xmath50 \\theta_{\\lambda } = \\\\ % \\sum_{s } \\left ( \\frac{1}{m_1 } \\sum_{\\tau } \\left [ f_{\\tau}^{\\rm ts}(s ) - f_{\\tau}^{\\rm fixed}(s ) \\right ] \\bar{f}_{\\mu\\tau}(s ) + \\frac{1}{m_2 } \\sum_{a }",
    "\\omega^{2}(s ) \\left [ \\sigma_{a}^{\\rm ts}(s ) - \\sigma^{\\rm fixed}_{a}(s ) \\right ] \\bar{\\sigma}_{\\mu a}(s ) \\right ) \\ ; , \\label{nabla2 } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    which we can further simplify to write @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are trivially defined by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ nabla2 ] ) and ( [ soecompact ] ) .",
    "hence , we can find the extrema of @xmath28 $ ] by solving a system of @xmath21 linear equations .",
    "our gf can be viewed as a @xmath21-dimensional parabola , and we always have @xmath54 \\geq 0 $ ] .",
    "further , as shown in appendix  [ sec : app1 ] , the eigenvalues of the associated hessian ( @xmath55 ) are either positive or zero .",
    "it is thus clear that a critical point of @xmath56 must be a minimum , never a saddle point or maximum .",
    "( note that , by definition , a saddle point requires the presence of both positive and negative eigenvalues . )",
    "it is also relatively easy to show ( see appendix  [ sec : app1 ] ) that , for a specific choice of @xmath57 and ts , we can have two possible scenarios : either eq .  ( [ soecompact ] ) has a single solution or it has infinite ones .",
    "the former case corresponds to the situation in which there exits a well - defined collection of values of the @xmath57 parameters yielding an optimum compromise to reproduce the ts data .",
    "( all the hessian eigenvalues are positive in this case , and the solution of eq .",
    "( [ soecompact ] ) is a minimum of @xmath56 . )",
    "the latter case corresponds to the situation in which the solution of eq .  ( [ soecompact ] ) is a manifold with dimension greater than zero , implying that some linear combinations of parameters can take arbitrary values without affecting @xmath56 .",
    "such combinations correspond to hessian eigenvectors with zero eigenvalue ; @xmath56 does not have a single minimum , but a manifold of minima , in this case .",
    "it is interesting to note the reasons why there may be linear dependencies in our system of equations .",
    "let us consider @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ soecompact ] ) ; these are @xmath21-dimensional objects that encapsulate all the information in the ts in a compact way . in the limit of a large @xmath21 and a relatively small ts",
    ", it may happen that the ts does not provide enough information to fit all the parameters in @xmath57 .",
    "in such a case , the system of equations will be underdetermined , yielding infinite solutions .",
    "a similar difficulty appears when the tss are obtained in ways that only explore a subset of the configuration space , e.g. , most typically , by running molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in relatively small supercells . in such a case",
    ", the periodic boundary conditions associated with the employed supercell effectively define the spatial range of the interatomic couplings that can be resolved . indeed , as far as the description of the ts data is concerned , and as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : equivalent - interactions ] , interactions extending beyond that supercell - defined distance become exactly equivalent to other shorter - range couplings .",
    "hence , they lead to linear dependencies when setting up the system of equations in eq .",
    "( [ soecompact ] ) .    in practice , it is easy to handle the situations in which eq .",
    "( [ soecompact ] ) has infinite solutions . on one hand",
    ", if we believe our ts is complete enough , the presence of infinite solutions suggests that we can simplify our model without loss of accuracy .",
    "we can do so in an orderly and physically - motivated way , e.g. , by removing from @xmath57 the longest - range interactions that lead to linear dependencies in eq .",
    "( [ soecompact ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we are interested in quantifying precisely all the interactions in our model , the presence of infinite solutions indicates that we need to extend the ts so as to remove the linear dependencies . in this case , we will typically need to include information that is qualitatively different from that in the original ts , e.g. , obtained from md simulations of larger supercells , etc .",
    "we are interested in constructing models that are accurate and , at the same time , permit fast calculations .",
    "hence , we need to find a way to construct the simplest ( computationally lightest ) models that reproduce the ts with a certain accuracy .",
    "naturally , we can use the goal function as the measure of accuracy , so that the above problem translates into finding the simplest model whose associated gf is below a certain threshold .",
    "( as we will see in section  [ sec : application ] , in order to evaluate a model s accuracy and predictive power , we will eventually adopt a practical approach that goes beyond evaluating the gf . )",
    "let @xmath58 be the set of @xmath59 terms , with associated parameters @xmath60 , that define _ all _ the possible interactions in our material of interest",
    ". given the specific form of our interatomic potentials , @xmath58 can be easily defined by three approximations or cutoffs : the maximum order of the polynomial , the maximum spatial range of the interactions , and the maximum number of bodies in the interaction terms . for specific choices of these three cutoffs",
    ", one can implement an algorithm that identifies all the sats the model can potentially contain .",
    "we will typically have a very large number of them , of the order of @xmath59  =  500 in the application discussed below .",
    "let us use the expression _",
    "@xmath21-model _ to refer to a model of @xmath21 terms , @xmath61 and @xmath62 being the corresponding sets of terms and parameters , respectively .",
    "we need a way to find the best @xmath21-model , i.e. , the choice of @xmath63 and @xmath57 that minimizes the gf when we restrict ourselves to models of @xmath21 terms .",
    "a brute - force approach to this search  by computing all possible @xmath21-models and comparing the corresponding gf values  would be a daunting task .",
    "for example , for a representative case of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have about 10@xmath66 different models .",
    "obviously , in spite of our efficient strategy to compute the parameters for an specific choice of @xmath63 , considering so many possibilities is computationally unfeasible .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by constraining the model search , implementing what can be described as a _ stepwise procedure with forward selection _ @xcite . in short ,",
    "we start with @xmath67 and identify the best 1-model , a problem that we solve exactly by considering all @xmath59 possible candidates .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the best 1-model .",
    "then , we move to @xmath69 and consider all possible @xmath70 models subject to the constraint that @xmath71 . in other words , we only consider @xmath69-models that contain the terms of the best @xmath21-model .",
    "we can solve this problem exactly , by considering all @xmath72 possibilities explicitly .",
    "then we iterate the procedure until a sufficiently small gf is obtained .",
    "we have checked the reliability of the above procedure in two ways .",
    "first , for a number of @xmath58 choices with small @xmath59 , we run a brute - force search for the best @xmath21-models , and compare the exact results thus obtained with the outcomes of our proposed strategy .",
    "in essence , our constrained approach succeeds in identifying the best @xmath21-model in almost all cases , and the very few exceptions correspond to cases with very small values of @xmath21 ( in our work with sto , we find this problem for @xmath73 , a limit where the corresponding models are not physically sound anyway ) .",
    "second , we consider the following refinement of our algorithm : once @xmath74 has been identified , we check whether it is possible to improve the gf by replacing one of the chosen @xmath21 terms by one of the remaining @xmath72 .",
    "we find that such a refinement seldom improves the best @xmath21-model , and the few cases in which an improvement is observed correspond to very small @xmath21 values .      in statistics ,",
    "_ cross - validation _ is a common procedure to analyze the predictiveness of a model , and is often used as _ stopping criterion _ in model construction methodologies .",
    "a rather usual approach to it is the so - called leave-@xmath9-out method @xcite .",
    "this method consist in the following steps . given a ts ,",
    "we remove from it @xmath9 randomly selected elements , and fit the best @xmath21-model to the remaining elements by minimizing the gf .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the resulting gf value .",
    "then , we test the accuracy of such best @xmath21-model by evaluating the gf using the @xmath9 ts elements left out of the fit .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the resulting gf value .",
    "naturally , we expect @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as models should improve as they become more complex .",
    "then , if we find @xmath79 such that @xmath80 , this indicates that our model is loosing predictive power as it grows , and we can thus identify the optimum size ( @xmath81 ) of the model .    unfortunately , in actual applications this procedure tends to render @xmath76 curves that display several minima , making it difficult to identify the most predictive model @xcite . in our particular case ,",
    "as we detail below , we find a different complication : we work with well - populated tss constructed from md trajectories , and the ts elements ( i.e. , the atomic configurations representative of the trajectory ) tend to contain similar information ; hence , our calculated @xmath82 curves do not present any minimum . as we will see below",
    ", we resolve this difficulty by creating a physically - motivated test set that allows us to perform a convincing cross - validation and verify that our models will be reliable for the calculation of properties of interest .      before concluding this section",
    ", we should note the main weakness of the approach just described , namely , that the energy of our optimum models is likely to be unbounded from below .",
    "our scheme involves running an unconstrained search for the best @xmath21-model , testing polynomial terms from a pool @xmath83 that essentially includes all possible couplings compliant with cutoffs concerning the order of the expansion , the spatial range of the interactions , and the number of bodies in the interacting terms .",
    "the behavior of the model for large atomic distortions is dominated by the highest - order terms , which are not guaranteed to be positive definite . in other words , nothing in our construction scheme prevents the models from presenting run - away solutions with @xmath84 .",
    "naively , one could expect that a complete enough ts will automatically produce bounded models . more precisely , high - energy atomic configurations , involving large distortions of the rs , provide information about the restoring forces that keep the atoms together ; hence , in order to tackle the unboundedness problem , it may seem sufficient to include representative configurations of that sort ( e.g. , as obtained from high - temperature md runs ) in the ts .",
    "unfortunately , our experience indicates that this procedure is not enough to constrain all possible run - away directions in the general case and , thus , it does not lead to an automatic model - generation scheme .    in this work",
    "we have considered a number of possible , potentially - automatic solutions to this problem , briefly described below .",
    "these experiments have led us to identify a practical strategy that , while requiring some inspection of the best models ( i.e. , while it is not fully automatic as implemented at present ) , appears as a satisfactory compromise , allowing to impose boundedness without any significant loss of accuracy .",
    "we have chosen srtio@xmath0 as our test material .",
    "sto is one of the most interesting perovskite oxides , and it has been receiving continued attention for years because of its critical importance to the field ( as , e.g. , it is the most widely used substrate on which thin films of other perovskites are grown @xcite ) and the unique physical effects it displays either in combination with other materials ( e.g. , exotic two - dimensional electron gas at the interface of sto with laalo@xmath0 @xcite , novel ferroelectric effects at superlattices of sto with pto @xcite ) or by itself ( e.g. , polar order at the ferroelastic domain walls of sto at low temperatures @xcite ) .",
    "this wealth of interesting properties is partly due to sto s unique and challenging lattice - dynamical behavior , which turns this compound into an unique test case for our automatic potential - construction method .",
    "our conjecture is that , if our scheme allows us to tackle sto successfully , it will probably allow us to investigate other , relatively simpler compounds as well .",
    "sto crystallizes in the perovskite structure , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : perovs ] .",
    "it displays a cubic phase ( with @xmath86 space group ) at high temperatures [ fig .",
    "[ fig : perovs](a ) ] , but transforms into a so - called antiferrodistortive ( afd ) structure [ fig .  [ fig : perovs](b ) ] when the temperature falls below @xmath87  =  110  k @xcite .",
    "this low - temperature phase has a tetragonal symmetry ( @xmath88 ) , featuring concerted rotations of the oxygen octahedra about one of the principal axes of the perovskite lattice .",
    "such rotations are modulated in antiphase when we move from cell to cell along the direction of the rotation axis , and the resulting structure is usually labeled @xmath89 in the notation introduced by glazer @xcite . [ in the following we will assume that the rotation axis lies along the @xmath90 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : perovs](b ) . ]",
    "another interesting feature of sto is its _ quantum paraelectric _",
    "character @xcite . on top of the mentioned afd structural instabilities ( soft phonon modes ) that drive the transition between the cubic and tetragonal phases , experiments @xcite and first - principles",
    "theory @xcite indicate that the cubic phase of sto presents yet another unstable distortion , namely , a polar mode whose condensation would create a macroscopic electric polarization .",
    "the reason why this spontaneous polarization is not observed experimentally in bulk sto samples is two - fold . on one hand , such a ferroelectric ( fe ) soft mode competes with the afd instability , and the occurrence of the latter tends to stabilize the former @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum fluctuations prevent the condensation of the weakened fe instability @xcite .",
    "the presence of such quantum effects ( which rely on the wave - like character of the relatively - heavy atoms in sto ) has been amply demonstrated theoretically and experimentally , their most obvious fingerprint being the anomalous behavior of the dielectric constant of sto at low temperatures ( see ref .   for experiments on sto , and ref .   for simulation results for another representative quantum paraelectric , ktao@xmath0 ) .",
    "the present work focuses on the construction of effective potentials that accurately reproduce the pes of a material as obtained from first principles .",
    "hence , a detailed comparison of the predictions of such potentials with the experimental observations is secondary in this context . in the case of our application to sto",
    ", we will solve our best models by means of _ classical _ metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , with the purpose of verifying that we obtain the correct qualitative behavior and investigating how details of the potential affect an all - important feature , i.e. , the phase - transition temperature @xmath91 .",
    "however , while we will briefly comment on the relation between our results and the known facts about sto , a quantitative comparison with experiment is not pertinent . indeed , because our simulations are classical , they do not include the quantum effects that strongly affect the behavior of sto at temperatures around and below the phase transition .",
    "a more detailed investigation of sto s properties , as predicted by our models and in connection with experiment , remains for future work .      to generate our ts data , we use dft within the local density approximation ( lda ) as implemented in the vasp package @xcite .",
    "the choice of lda over other energy functionals is not trivial .",
    "on one hand , it is known that lda overbinds , predicting equilibrium volumes that are generally smaller than the experimental ones by 1 - 2% , and that this error can have a dramatic influence in the pes of materials like sto , which are very reactive to applied stresses .",
    "hence , the lda may not be the most appropriate choice if we are aiming at reproducing sto s experimental behavior with quantitative accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , there is an ample literature on sto modeling , including the construction of coarse - grained effective potentials @xcite , based on lda results .",
    "hence , using the lda allows us to make a more direct comparison with those previous theoretical works  including the sto model that some of us developed in ref .",
    " , which is the most important consideration in the context of this work .",
    "further details of our lda calculations are as follows .",
    "we treat the ionic cores using the projector - augmented wave method @xcite , and solve explicitly for the following electrons : sr s 3@xmath30 , 3@xmath21 , and 4@xmath30 ; ti s 3@xmath30 , 3@xmath21 , 4@xmath30 , and 3@xmath92 ; and o s 2@xmath30 and 2@xmath21 .",
    "the electronic wave functions are represented in a plane - wave basis truncated at 500  ev .",
    "brillouin zone integrals are computed in a grid of 6@xmath936@xmath936 @xmath94-points for calculations involving the 5-atom perovskite cell as periodically - repeated unit , or equivalent meshes when larger supercells are used .",
    "we have checked that these calculation conditions render results that are sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "structural minimizations are run until residual force components are below 0.01  ev /  .",
    "langevin molecular dynamics simulations are run using the parrinello - rahman scheme @xcite , to allow fluctuations of the cell volume and shape at zero applied pressure .",
    "the langevin parameters are chosen to obtain a fast approach to the targeted temperature and reduce fluctuations .",
    "( since we are not interested in obtaining converged equilibrium properties , the details of the langevin dynamics are not critical . )",
    "the md runs are always initialized with random velocities , and the atomic motions are unconstrained ( thus , no symmetries are preserved ) .",
    "we typically use a time step of 2  fs .      as done in ref .  , and customary in theoretical works on ferroelectric and dielectric perovskites @xcite",
    ", we choose as our rs the cubic phase of the material , as obtained from a symmetry - constrained structural relaxation using the lda .",
    "the high symmetry of this phase ( full cubic @xmath86 group ) drastically reduces the number of allowed independent couplings in our polynomial expansion , which simplifies the task of parameter fitting .",
    "the relevant pes of sto is characterized by relatively small atomic distortions ; indeed , when we compare the cubic ( rs ) and tetragonal ( ground state ) structures , we find that the maximum change in bond distances is about 0.16   , corresponding to sr ",
    "o pairs . additionally , we know that the cubic phase is unstable against various structural distortions ( most notably , the afd modes driving the transition to the low - temperature structure ) , which implies that the harmonic part of the pes is not bounded from below . given these facts , we decided to consider a 4-th order taylor series as the simplest possible theory that is physically sound for sto , as in particular it permits energy boundedness from below .    as regards the purely elastic part of the model , we adopt the simplest possible approximation and include only harmonic terms .",
    "this choice seems both accurate ( as the strains involved in sto s structural phase transition are relatively small , below 0.5  % ) and sufficient to produce a physically sound model .",
    "note that sto s cubic phase does not present any purely elastic instability @xcite , and the harmonic elastic energy is thus bounded from below .",
    "as regards the strain - phonon coupling energy , we restrict ourselves to the lowest - order terms allowed by symmetry , which are quadratic in the displacements and linear in the strains .",
    "we split the interatomic interactions in two parts , short - range ( chemical ) and long - range ( coulombic ) , the latter being amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "more precisely , we treated the long - range electrostatic couplings exactly as in ref .",
    "@xcite : we used the well - known analytical formula for the harmonic coupling between electric dipoles , which ultimately depends only on the atomic born charge tensors and the high - frequency ( purely electronic ) dielectric response of the material @xcite . as regards",
    "the short - range harmonic interactions , previous investigations on the phonon band structure of the cubic phase of sto @xcite and similar compounds @xcite show that they decay quickly with distance , and that a 2@xmath932@xmath932 repetition of the elemental 5-atom cell is enough to capture all the significant ones . as regards",
    "the short - range anharmonic interactions , previous modeling works @xcite indicate that they are even shorter in range .",
    "( they are treated as on - site or self - energy terms in most models in the literature @xcite . )",
    "hence , we consider all the terms within the interaction range defined by the 2@xmath932@xmath932 40-atom supercell .",
    "we allow anharmonic interactions to extend as far as the short - range harmonic ones , i.e. , up to the maximum distance effectively defined by our 40-atom supercell . finally , we allow all our coupling terms to involve as many atoms ( bodies ) as their order allows .",
    "we then generate all the symmetry - allowed polynomial terms compatible with these cutoffs . for @xmath6",
    "we obtain 45 harmonic terms , 79 3rd - order ones , and 275 4th - order ones ; for @xmath95 we obtain 3 terms , and 161 terms for @xmath96 .",
    "note that these terms only depend on the structure and symmetry of the ideal cubic perovskite phase ; hence , they can be applied to the study of any such material , not only sto .    in the following we present various exercises aimed at exploring our new recipe to fit the lattice potentials thus defined from a ts of dft data .",
    "yet , two parts of these potentials ( the bare elastic energy and the dipole - dipole interactions , both truncated at the harmonic level ) can be trivially obtained from perturbational @xcite or finite - difference dft simulations .",
    "further , these two parts of the energy are very simple , and would not benefit from any additional optimization provided by our systematic fitting procedure . hence ,",
    "for these terms we use the values directly obtained from dft and given in appendix  [ sec : app2 ] ; they are thus included in @xmath27 [ eq .  ( [ eq : compactspld ] ) ] in the fits .",
    "the harmonic part of our model describes the pes around the rs , i.e. , the interatomic couplings determining the phonon spectrum of the cubic phase .",
    "the phonon spectrum of a given structure can be computed from first principles via perturbative @xcite or finite - displacement methods that give access to the interactions in real space .",
    "hence , it should be relatively easy for us to construct models of the type proposed here and having an essentially exact harmonic part ; note that the construction approach described in ref .",
    "took advantage of this fact .",
    "however , the present scheme focuses on fitting , as opposed to explicitly computing , the model parameters to produce potentials of optimal complexity and size .",
    "further , here we work with a taylor series written in terms of products of displacement differences , the harmonic part of our potential having the form @xmath97 in contrast with the usual expression in terms of products of simple displacements @xmath98 which is commonly used in phonon analysis .",
    "hence , it is worth testing our present scheme by applying it to obtain the harmonic part of the pes around the rs , to explicitly confirm whether our fitting procedure and displacement - difference representation are able to yield an essentially perfect description .    to do this",
    ", we use a ts composed of the following structures : the lda - relaxed cubic phase of sto in a 2@xmath932@xmath932 supercell ( our rs ) and slightly distorted versions of the rs in which we move individual atoms by 0.015   .",
    "( these are exactly the same structures one would consider to compute the phonons of sto s cubic phase by the finite - displacements method . )",
    "then , we run the fitting procedure described in section [ sec : formalism ] , considering a set @xmath99 that includes all the possible ( 45 ) short - range harmonic terms compatible with the cutoffs described above . as mentioned above ,",
    "the harmonic dipole - dipole interactions are computed analytically and included in @xmath27 .    to present our results , let us recall that the harmonic part of the energy can be expressed in a more compact form if we use the basis of eigenvectors of the force - constant matrix @xmath100 .",
    "thus , given a model of @xmath21 harmonic terms @xmath101 , we can expand the displacement - different products to obtain the corresponding force - constant matrix @xmath102 $ ] , diagonalize it , and compare the results with the exact lda solution .",
    ", at two specific @xmath103-points @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( see text ) . the solid lines indicate the results obtained from the fitted model as a function of the number of terms included , while the exact dft - computed results are given by dashed lines . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : harmonic ] shows the results as a function of the number of terms in the harmonic model ; in particular , we show the eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath103-points @xmath104 [ @xmath106 and @xmath105 [ @xmath107 , where @xmath14 is the lattice constant of the 5-atom rs cell ] .",
    "as we can see , the agreement is essentially perfect for @xmath21-models with @xmath108 , confirming that our scheme is able to produce exact harmonic models _ and _ , in passing , automatically identify the dominant interactions . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we will briefly discuss the most important of such couplings .",
    "we generate several tss aimed at exploring the configuration space accessible at various temperatures .",
    "more precisely , we generate tss at 10  k and 300  k ; additionally , we compute test sets at 200  k and 500  k. our training and test sets are obtained from md runs employing a 40-atom ( 2@xmath932@xmath932 ) sto supercell , which , as argued above , we deem sufficient to obtain information about the relevant short - range interactions .",
    "further , the md runs are performed at 0  gpa , allowing the cell volume and shape to fluctuate during the simulation ; this permits access to information concerning the strain - dependent parts of the potential .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , our small 40-atom simulation supercell does not allow us to talk about a well defined temperature in our md runs ; our target temperature is just a convenient handle that we use to push the system into exploring different regions of configuration space .",
    "we find it important to start all our md runs from the rs , for the following reason . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : md - example ] , the length of our typical md run is about 1500  fs , including an initial stage in which the system explores the surroundings of the cubic phase ( the potential energy increases considerably as the atoms move following the random initial velocities compatible with a 10  k kinetic energy ) to eventually ( at about 400  fs in the figure ) start moving towards the ground state . once a md run is computed , we construct the corresponding ts by picking 100 configurations from the trajectory ; we pick such configurations randomly , but making sure they are homogeneously distributed throughout the md trajectory , so as to retain information on the initial part of the run .",
    "this is necessary to obtain models that yield accurate energy differences . indeed , because our scheme is based on fitting energy derivatives , in order to get an accurate energy difference between two structures ( e.g. , and most importantly , between the rs and the ground state ) , we need the model to describe well the connecting path .    here",
    "we discuss models constructed by fitting to three different tss , one obtained from a md run at 10  k ( denoted `` ts@10 '' in the following ) , a second one obtained from a md run at 300  k ( `` ts@300 '' ) , and a third one that combines configurations from ts@10 and ts@300 ( `` ts@10 + 300 '' ) .",
    "the ts@10 explores the low - energy configurations of the material , and contains the kind of information that has been traditionally included in effective models of sto and similar compounds @xcite .",
    "_ a priori _ we do not expect the models obtained from ts@10 to accurately describe the configuration space that the material explores at higher temperatures ; hence the interest in considering ts@300 as well .",
    "finally , we consider ts@10 + 300 to investigate the possibility of creating models that give a good description of low- and high - energy configurations simultaneously .",
    "as we will see below , obtaining an accurate description of the low - energy pes of sto is not an easy task . in particular , we find it critical to complement the tss with a single additional configuration that competes in energy with the ground state but is not visited in our default md runs . such a low - energy state is denoted @xmath109 in glazer s notation ; it involves in - phase rotations of the o@xmath85 octahedra about one of the principal axes of the perovskite lattice ( recall that the rotations are in antiphase in sto s ground state ) .",
    "hence , our ts@10 and ts@10 + 300 training sets are completed with this additional piece of information .    finally , as shown in section  [ sec : harmonic ] , it is possible to compute the harmonic part of the model in an essentially exact way .",
    "hence , here we discuss models in which we fit all the short - range phonon and strain - phonon couplings freely ( `` free models '' or fms in the following ) and also models in which the exact harmonic part of @xmath110 is retained in @xmath27 ( `` exact harmonic models '' or ehms in the following ) .",
    "this allows us to test the importance ( and evaluate the convenience ) of having a perfect description of the harmonic energy around the the rs .",
    ".list of the sto models constructed in this work ( see text ) .",
    "the number of parameters in the optimum cross - validated models is indicated in the last column . for the ehms",
    ", we also indicate that we retain 45 harmonic terms in @xmath6 , i.e. , all the independent interactions within our @xmath111 supercell . [",
