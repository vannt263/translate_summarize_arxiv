    "they are given by d3branes wrapping supersymmetric 3-cycles in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these are point - like objects from the scft point of view .",

    ".    extended objects in the gauge theory side also correspond to wrapped d  branes in the string theory side .",
    "string - like objects as _ confining _ or _ fat strings _ arise from d3branes wrapping @xmath27-cycles . _ domain walls _ , _ fractional branes _ and _ defect cfts _ are given by d5branes wrapping 2-cycles in @xmath1 . the introduction of _ matter hypermultiples",
    "that is , quarks in the fundamental representation , requires spacetime filling wrapped d7branes @xcite .",
    "if the number of wrapped d  branes is much less than @xmath2 , we can stick to the probe approximation .",
    "for instance , this is the case when matter is introduced in the quenched approximation , @xmath28 .",
    "this is the framework considered in the present talk .",
    "let us consider a solution of iib supergravity whose metric is of the form @xmath29 ( we choose , for simplicity , a unit radius @xmath30 for both spaces ) .",

    "a set of local complex coordinates , @xmath39 , can be identified , such that the holomorphic 3-form reads @xmath40 = \\frac{dz_1 \\wedge dz_2 \\wedge dz_3}{z_1 z_2 } ~. \\label{threeform}\\ ] ] the killing spinors in these sasaki  einstein manifolds read ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the angle conjugated to the @xmath46 @xmath47symmetry .    consider a dp  brane probe in @xmath8 .",
    "the embedding can be characterized by the set of functions @xmath48 , where @xmath49 are the worldvolume coordinates .",
    "the supersymmetric embeddings are obtained by imposing the condition @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a killing spinor of the background @xcite , and @xmath52 is a matrix that depends on the embedding @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath53 is a new projection giving rise to bps equations that determine the supersymmetric embeddings of the brane probes .",
    "it is a local condition that must be satisfied at any point of the probe worldvolume .",
    "dibaryon operators can be built for the different bifundamental fields in the quiver gauge theory .",
    "they are pointlike objects that correspond to supersymmetric configurations of d3branes wrapping a three - cycle , @xmath54 .",
    "the homology of these manifolds allows for several inequivalent cycles .",
    "it is important to distinguish between _ doublet _ and _ singlet _ dibaryon operators according to the transformation properties of the corresponding constituent chiral field under the global @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "the conformal dimension @xmath56 of the operator dual to a d3brane probe wrapping @xmath57 , is proportional to the volume , @xmath58 we can then compute the @xmath47-charge of the operator since it is related to its dimension , @xmath59 .",
    "its baryon number ( in units of @xmath2 ) can be obtained as the integral of the pullback of a @xmath60-form @xcite , @xmath61_{\\mathcal{c}_3 } ~ , \\label{baryonnum}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is a selfdual ( 1,1)-form satisfying @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is a constant that depends on @xmath1 .",
    "armed with these expressions , we can extract all the relevant gauge theory information .",
    "an exhaustive study of different d3branes embeddings corresponding to all possible dibaryons has been carried out for @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite superconformal field theories .",
    "this was done by demanding @xmath65symmetry .",
    "besides implying a new projection on the killing spinor , @xmath50 also entails a set of first order bps equations whose simplest solutions yield a panoply of embeddings of @xmath57 .",
    "compatibility with the @xmath66 structure of the spinor implies that the d3brane must be placed at the center of @xmath67 .",
    "these @xmath68 supersymmetric configurations correspond to dibaryons in the gauge theory side .",
    "this assertion can be checked by computing their associated @xmath47-charges and baryon numbers .",
    "it is not difficult to show that more general embeddings result from the bps equations .",
    "indeed , it is possible to show that these are equivalent to cauchy ",
    "riemann equations for the local complex coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then , the most general solution is given by a holomorphic embedding , @xmath71 .",
    "an immediate check consists in realizing that these generalized embeddings are calibrated , @xmath72_{\\mathcal{d}_4}\\,=\\ , { \\rm vol}(\\mathcal{d}_4 ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the volume form of the divisor . some of these embeddings can be understood as excitations of the dibaryons in the case of @xmath12 @xcite . however , it is important to stress that this local condition does not always make sense globally .",
    "we have seen examples of this feature in @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "excitations of a singlet dibaryon can be represented as graviton fluctuations in the presence of the dibaryon . instead , certain bps excitations of the wrapped d3branes corresponding to doublet dibaryons can be interpreted as a single particle state in @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "these excitations , roughly speaking , correspond to the insertion of a mesonic operator @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we have to count all possible inequivalent ( in the chiral ring ) mesonic operators .",
    "they correspond to ( short and long ) loops in the quiver diagram @xcite .",
    "the simplest ones are operators with r - charge 2 , given by short loops in the quiver .",
    "these are the terms appearing in the tree level superpotential .",
    "they are all equivalent in the chiral ring .",
    "let us call its representative @xmath75 .",
    "it is a spin 1 chiral operator with scaling dimension @xmath76 .",
    "its @xmath77 charge vanishes .    as for the long loops in the quiver ,",
    "let us focus in the only non - trivial case , @xmath17 .",
    "there are two operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 with spin , respectively , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "they have a nonvanishing @xmath77 charge .",
    "these are the building blocks of other chiral operators , @xmath82 .",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations of these dibaryons along the transverse @xmath83 can be worked out @xcite .",
    "the action for the d3brane should be expanded around the static configuration , @xmath84 . at quadratic order , it is possible to identify ground state solutions with bps operators .",
    "their conformal dimensions can be read off , and the spectrum can be shown to coincide with the mesonic chiral operator quantum numbers .",
    "for a d5brane that wraps the whole @xmath1 space , the flux of the rr @xmath85form acts as a source for the electric worldvolume gauge field which , in turn , gives rise to a bundle of fundamental strings emanating from the d  brane .",
    "the probe action must include the worldvolume field @xmath86 in both the dirac  born  infeld ( dbi ) and wess  zumino ( wz ) terms : @xmath87 we were unable to find a supersymmetric configuration . from the point of view of @xmath65symmetry , it turns out that the new projection , @xmath88 , which , as expected , corresponds to fundamental strings in the radial direction , can not be imposed on the killing spinors . besides , it is also possible to show that , from the point of view of the worldvolume theory , there are no solitons saturating a bogomolnyi bound .",
    "thus , we conclude from this incompatibility argument that the baryon vertex configuration breaks completely the supersymmetry of the @xmath8 background .",
    "consider a d5brane probe that wraps a two - dimensional submanifold @xmath89 of @xmath1 and is a codimension one object in @xmath67 . in the field theory side , this is the kind of brane that represents a domain wall across which the rank of the gauge groups jumps .",
    "the upshot of the detailed analysis accomplished in @xcite is as follows .",
    "we have shown that the cone @xmath90 , is calibrated .",
    "indeed , the holomorphic @xmath91 form @xmath92 of @xmath6 see eq.([threeform]) , can be naturally used to calibrate such submanifolds : @xmath93 is called a special lagrangian submanifold of @xmath6 if the pullback of @xmath92 to @xmath93 is , up to a constant phase @xmath94 , equal to its volume , @xmath95_{\\mathcal{l}_3}\\,=\\,e^{i\\lambda}\\ , { \\rm vol}\\,(\\mathcal{l}_3 ) ~. \\label{d5calibration}\\ ] ] the fractional brane can be also understood as a bps worldvolume soliton .",
    "this arises from the hamiltonian density resulting from the dbi action , since it can be written as a sum of squares in such a way that it becomes minimum when a set of bps differential equations are satisfied .",
    "not surprisingly , they agree with those obtained from the @xmath65symmetry approach .",
    "the d7-branes which fill the four minkowski spacetime dimensions and extend along some holographic non - compact direction can be potentially used as flavor branes , _",
    "i.e. _ as branes whose fluctuations can be identified with the dynamical mesons of the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the ansatz we adopt for the worldvolume coordinates is @xmath96 , and we consider embeddings of the form @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in order to implement @xmath99",
    ", we shall require that the spinor @xmath51 is an eigenvector of the matrix @xmath100 defined above .",
    "these configurations preserve the four ordinary supersymmetries of the background . by means of the @xmath65symmetry technique , it is possible to show that a generic configuration can be nicely written as a holomorphic embedding @xcite @xmath101 where the @xmath102 s are constants and @xmath103 .",
    "these configurations seem to be the relevant ones to introduce matter in the fundamental representation @xcite .    the identification of supersymmetric 4-cycles that a d7brane can wrap also matters in cosmological models where inflation is produced by the motion of a d3brane in a warped throat .",
    "the potential ruling this motion is actually sensitive to the specific embedding of the wrapped d7brane @xcite .",
    "another cases of interest include a non - supersymmetric ( still stable ) probe d3brane extended along one gauge theory direction and wrapping a 2-cycle ( a _ fat string _ from the gauge theory point of view ) , a d5brane that extends infinitely in the holographic direction ( a _ defect cft _ that preserves four supersymmetries ) , and a d7brane wrapping the whole @xmath1 space , and being codimension two in @xmath67 ( a supersymmetric _ string _ ) . in the d5brane configuration , we have also turned on a worldvolume flux and found that it leads to a bending of the profile of the wall .",
