    "the red - sequence cluster survey @xcite is a 90 square degree optical survey performed at cfht and ctio using @xmath5 and @xmath0 filters .",
    "it utilizes the red sequence of elliptical galaxies to find galactic overdensities on the sky @xcite .",
    "the color information also guards against projection effects , and provides photometric redshift estimates .",
    "the survey has identified between 3500 and 4000 clusters total ( in the redshift range 0.2 @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath2 1.2 ) , over 1500 of which are at least as optically rich as abell class 0 clusters @xcite .",
    "simulations indicate that the survey is complete to abell class 1 at a redshift of 1 for blue fractions less than 0.45 , and that false detection rates are less than 5% , which is significantly lower than that of single - passband optical cluster surveys @xcite .",

    "so far we have observed six high redshift ( 0.64 @xmath2 z @xmath2 1.0 ) cluster candidates with the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists our current sample of follow - up observations .",
    "all six clusters were detected in the x - ray , using the ciao tool csmooth , to better than @xmath10 .",
    "the x - ray centroids of these clusters were all found within 10 arcseconds of their respective optical centers .",
    "spectra were extracted from 300 kpc ( @xmath11cdm with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) radius regions around the x - ray centroids of these clusters , with backgrounds taken from each respective aimpoint chip .",
    "the spectra were fit in xspec using absorbed single temperature models with galactic column densities and abundances fixed at 0.3 solar .",
    "five of the six observations yielded enough counts to constrain a temperature .",
    "results are listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "@xmath15 , explained in detail in @xcite , is a parameter which describes the optical richness of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "technically it is the galaxy - cluster spatial covariance amplitude , but in essence it is simply a measure of galaxy overdensity within a given aperture , normalized for the expected spatial distribution of galaxies in the cluster and the evolving galaxy luminosity function .",
    "all of the rcs clusters that have been observed with chandra have richnesses that imply abell richness classes of at least 1 .",
    "there exist a few challenges in the calculation of @xmath15 at high redshift .",
    "one is the lack of a complete knowledge of the galaxy luminosity function at these redshifts .",
    "another is uncertainty due to cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "the latter uncertainty can be minimized by employing the parameter @xmath16 , which is essentially the same as @xmath15 , but is calculated using only galaxies in the red - sequence . throughout this paper",
    "we will use only the parameter @xmath16    it is expected that @xmath15 should correlate strongly with x - ray temperature for relaxed clusters , and a trend has been seen when optical richness is plotted versus temperature for moderate redshift ( @xmath17 ) , x - ray selected clusters @xcite .",
    "however , the same correlation is not apparent when rcs clusters are added to the plot ( figure [ figure2 ] ) .    in comparison with lower redshift clusters , high redshift optically selected clusters with similar @xmath15 values",
    "appear systematically cooler and less luminous than their x - ray selected counterparts , possibly suggesting that a smaller fraction of the intra - cluster gas in these objects has collapsed and become virialized .",
    "this interpretation may seem intuitive , given that x - ray cluster surveys preferentially select more relaxed clusters with deep potential wells and oftentimes cooling cores .",
    "our findings reinforce the need to question what defines a cluster , and whether x - ray selected clusters primarily represent a highly virialized , high x - ray luminosity tail of the cluster distribution .     vs. @xmath16 .",
    "each square represents one of 13 moderate redshift ( 0.1 @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath2 0.6 ) cnoc clusters @xcite taken from the chandra archive , and triangles denote rcs clusters .",
    "temperatures were calculated using spectra extracted within a 300 kpc ( @xmath11cdm ) radius region and fit over the 0.6 - 7.0 kev energy range .",
    "a single temperature model was used , with galactic absorption .",
    "the abundance of rcs clusters was fixed at 0.3 .",
    "temperature error bars show 90% confidence intervals , and @xmath16 error bars are shown at 1@xmath18.,title=\"fig:\",height=288 ] [ figure2 ]      a radial surface brightness profile was computed over the range 0.29 - 7.0 kev in circular annuli for each cluster .",
    "we were able to constrain @xmath4 models for four clusters .",
    "best fit parameters are expressed in table [ table2 ] and an example is shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "the results of these fits are interesting in that @xmath4 values seem systematically low for these clusters , with the implication that , on average , high redshift optically selected clusters are less centrally condensed than x - ray selected samples .     model , and the dotted line indicates the fit - determined background value.,title=\"fig:\",height=288 ] [ figure3 ]      though many of our results indicate that rcs clusters differ significantly from x - ray selected clusters , their x - ray properties are consistent with a standard @xmath3 relationship .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] is a plot of @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 for 13 cnoc and 5 rcs clusters .",
    "the consistency of rcs clusters with the @xmath3 relationship of moderate redshift x - ray selected clusters implies that though rcs clusters may possess relatively low mass virialized cores of gas , the gas is in a similar physical state to that found in x - ray selected samples .",
    "vs. @xmath20 .",
    "squares indicate 13 cnoc clusters and triangles represent the 5 rcs clusters .",
    "unabsorbed luminosities were calculated with xspec and converted to bolometric x - ray luminosities with pimms .",
    "temperatures were obtained with the same method as in figure [ figure2 ] .",

    "the red - sequence cluster survey has uncovered a large sample of high redshift cluster candidates .",
    "all of the rcs clusters observed with chandra were detected at greater than 3@xmath18 significance in the x - ray .",
    "this is evidence that the rcs method is a reliable way to detect high redshift clusters .",
    "the x - ray properties of rcs clusters are consistent with a standard @xmath3 relationship .",
    "this leads us to believe that the x - ray gas in these clusters is in a physical state very similar to that found in x - ray selected clusters .",
    "the results of detailed x - ray analysis imply that though these clusters have extended structures of galaxies , they possess relatively small virialized cores .",
    "these findings are similar to those from a number of previously conducted optical surveys @xcite .",
    "optical , high redshift cluster surveys regularly find candidates with lower x - ray luminosities than those of x - ray selected clusters .",
    "our study suggests that the rcs survey is detecting a different population of clusters from that found in x - ray selected samples , possibly including ultimately very rich clusters which are currently in the early stages of virialization .",
    "similar objects have recently been described by @xcite .",
    "such systems may be expected to be more common at high redshifts in a low matter density universe .",
    "optical surveys are much more sensitive to such systems than are x - ray surveys , especially if any related filamentary structures lie along the line of sight ( though it is unlikely that all of the rcs cluster candidates that were followed - up with chandra are associated with such structures ) .",
    "upcoming chandra observations of five new and two previously observed rcs clusters in the next ao , along with ongoing velocity dispersion measurements and weak lensing analysis should help to provide more definitive constraints on the masses , dynamical states , and gas content of high redshift optically selected samples of galaxy clusters .",
