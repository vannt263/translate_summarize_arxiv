    "in order to test general relativity , one has to compare it to other , alternate theories of gravitation .",
    "_ tensor - scalar _ theories , in which gravity is described by a spin-2 field combined with one or several spin-0 fields , are not only alternate theories , but `` generalize general relativity '' ( see @xcite ) ; meaning that general relativity is obtained in them by setting all scalar fields to zero .",
    "several such theories have been developed , from fierz @xcite , jordan @xcite , brans and dicke @xcite to bergman @xcite , nordtvedt @xcite , wagoner @xcite and , more recently , damour and esposito - farse @xcite . in all these theories ,",
    "the spin-0 and spin-2 fields ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are coupled to matter via an effective metric tensor @xmath3 .",
    "the jordan - fierz - brans - dicke theory has only one free parameter @xmath4 , whereas for bergman , nordtvedt and wagoner the parameter is a function @xmath5 .",
    "damour and esposito - farse considered an arbitrary number of scalar fields , coupled one to the other .",
    "all these theories are motivated by , mainly , two theoretical reasons :    1 .",
    "they represent the low - energy limit of superstring theories ( @xcite and @xcite ) 2 .",
    "they give rise to new `` extended '' inflationary models @xcite    since in brans - dicke theory @xmath6 is a linear function of @xmath1 , solar system experiments ( weak field ) are sufficient to constrain the theory , even in strong fields . nevertheless , a more general theory , in which @xmath6 is a parabolic function ( depending on two parameters ) , shows non - perturbative effects in strong field @xcite , described as `` spontaneous scalarization '' in @xcite .",
    "thus , when describing neutron stars , general relativity and tensor - scalar theory can give significant differences for their masses , radii and gravitational field , whereas the difference can still be negligible in our solar system data . as a consequence , weak - field experiments",
    "_ can not _ give much information on strong - field regime , and one needs to test this strong - field regime by other means :    * by looking for the orbital decay of binary - pulsar systems .",
    "this has been done by damour and esposito - farse ( @xcite and @xcite ) , who constrained the parameter space of the coupling function , * by looking for monopolar gravitational radiation from collapsing compact sources which could be detected by the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatories ( such as virgo @xcite and ligo @xcite ) .",
    "this latter method requires that the signal be known and that the observed ( or unobserved ) amplitude be related to the coupling function parameters . such kind of computations",
    "have already been performed by various groups , but they all considered only an oppenheimer - snyder collapse ( i.e. `` dust '' matter , with no pressure ) , either in brans - dicke theory ( @xcite and @xcite ) or by doing some taylor expansion of the coupling function @xcite . in this latter , the parameter space of the coupling function was restricted to the part where non - perturbative strong - fields effects do not happen .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the results of computations of a spherically symmetric collapse , of a neutron star toward a black hole , ) ] with one scalar field and an arbitrary coupling function .",
    "all the hydrodynamics and field equations are treated with no approximation in order to get the monopolar gravitational wave form and amplitude . moreover , including the equation of state allows to start the collapse with quite a realistic neutron star configuration and thus , spurious waves signals are avoided ( see [ s : compar ] ) .",
    "the paper in organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : equa ] describes the evolution equations for the star ; section  [ s : resu ] gives the numerical results : initial - value models ( [ s : stat ] ) , collapse and resulting wave signal ( [ s : scagw ] ) , comparison with previous works ( [ s : compar ] ) and exploration of the parameter space ( [ s : expl ] ) ; finally section  [ s : conc ] gives some concluding remarks .",
    "as it has been stated before , the most general theory containing a spin-2 field and one ( massless ) spin-0 field contains one arbitrary coupling function @xmath7 .",
    "the action is given by s=(16g_*)^-1d^4x(r_*-2g_*^ _ _ ) + s_m[_m , a^2()g^ * _ ] where all quantities with asterisks are related to the `` einstein metric '' @xmath8 : @xmath9 is the bare gravitational coupling constant , @xmath10 the curvature scalar for this metric and @xmath11 .",
    "the term @xmath12 denotes the action of the matter , represented by the fields @xmath13 , which is coupled to the `` jordan - fierz '' metric @xmath14 ; all quantities with a tilde are related to this metric .",
    "that means that all non - gravitational experiments measure this metric , although the field equations of the theory are better formulated in the einstein metric .",
    "the indices of einstein frame quantities are moved through einstein metric , whereas those of jordan - fierz quantities are moved through jordan - fierz one . by varying @xmath15 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the laplace - beltrami operator of @xmath8 , @xmath19 denoting the levi - civita connection of @xmath8 .",
    "one can see that @xmath20 is the basic , field - dependent coupling function between matter and scalar field .",
    "general relativity is obtained for @xmath21 .",

    "this property is not evident in tensor - scalar theory , but the dynamical code being sensitive enough to trigger the instability only by round - off errors , it has been checked numerically .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium is obtained , thanks to pseudo - spectral techniques ( see appendix  [ sa : cheb ] and @xcite ) , up to very high accuracy ( @xmath79 relative error on the hydrostatic equilibrium ) , which enables the dynamical code to be sensitive to instability ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter , four collapse calculations will be presented , called a , b , c and d. the parameters of the static configurations , which were used as initial conditions for the collapses , are described in table  [ t : coll ] .",

    "[ f : dyncol ] and [ f : gps306 ] one sees that the star has almost entered its schwarzschild radius ( @xmath83 at the end of the collapse ) ; so that no significant later evolution could be achieved inside the star .",
    "actually , one notices that the lapse goes to zero within the schwarzschild radius of the star .",
    "since all evolution equations are written @xmath84 and the coordinate velocity @xmath85 , all hydrodynamic and scalar - field quantities are `` frozen '' inside the star .",
    "therefore , their evolution can be numerically stopped , in order to avoid the singularity of @xmath86 . however",
    ", all field quantities continue to evolve _ outside _ the star , as long as one wants in terms of coordinate time ( which is the time of an observer at spatial infinity ) .",
    "the results of this evolution are shown in fig .  [",
    "f : gps306 ] , for collapse a. the fate of the scalar field is particularly interesting : for @xmath87 the field relaxes toward the asymptotic constant value set by cosmological evolution ; the scalar energy of the star is radiated away as scalar gravitational wave .",
    "the scalar field ( @xmath88 ) is considered to be sufficiently far away from the star ( i.e. in the wave zone ) to give the monopolar gravitational wave signal . using the `` frozen star '' to evolve the fields outside the star , makes the integration time long enough to get all the information from the collapse at @xmath87 ( where all gauges become equivalent ) .",
    "the main difference from general relativity is the scalar monopolar radiation , which carries away energy and can interact with a detector .",
    "looking far from the source ( at a distance @xmath87 ) , one can write the metric ( see @xcite ) _ ( r , t ) = a^2(_0 )  [ f _ + 1r  ( h _ + 2_0 f f _ ) + o(r^-2 ) ] where @xmath89 is the flat metric , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are respectively the quadrupolar and monopolar components of the wave .",

    "finally , the radiated einstein - frame bondi energy writes e_scal = c^3 g _ * _ 0^+ (dfdt)^2 dt [ e : eray ] which is the total energy radiated in gravitational waves .",

    "@xcite , dealing more with the fate of the final object .",
    "however , comparing @xmath105 of this work , with @xmath106 of their paper gives the same result . whereas the authors can conclude on the final state of the collapse ,",
    "this work can not describe it .",
    "all that can be said is that the scalar charge ( or mass ) is all radiated away , so that the scalar field relaxes toward its cosmological value , and that an apparent horizon is _ expected _ to appear ( cf .",
    "[ s : scagw ] ) . these results still hold in more general tensor - scalar theory .",
    "finally , it can be pointed out that , contrary to their work , here the tensor mass in the _ einstein _ frame is considered , not in the jordan - fierz one .",
    "the last study of spherically symmetric collapse in tensor - scalar theory was done by harada et al .",
    "they used the oppenheimer - snyder metric ( in general relativity ) as a background spacetime and did some taylor expansion of tensors and equations in terms of scalar field coupling function parameters .",
    "therefore , they used unrealistic initial conditions ( @xmath102 ) and could not study the cases of spontaneous scalarization .",

    "the results are different , although showing the same tendancy as in @xcite , for many @xmath107 , due to the fact that harada et al . took unrealistic initial conditions . thus in their simulations ,",
    "when the collapse begins , the scalar field on the one hand evolves to reach its quasi - equilibrium configuration , on the other hand , it feels the effects of the collapse .",
    "their signal is then a superposition of these two effects : raise of the scalar field up to its equilibrium value , with one or several oscillations depending on @xmath107 , then the fall of this field , due to the collapse of the matter . the signals for @xmath112 have more important oscillations than other ones ; this may be explained as follows .",
    "inside the star , there are unstable modes which develop for these @xmath107 and when the ratio @xmath113 becomes small , as it has been shown by harada in for static configurations ( see fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , near the star s center , @xmath114 allowing for spontaneous scalarization to develop . here",
    ", one can see an effect of the pressure on the signal .",
    "these non - perturbative modes develop on a time - scale @xmath115 @xmath116 ( see eq .",

    "this latter has been taken between @xmath120 and @xmath121 , either in spontaneous scalarization ( @xmath122 ) , or without it ( @xmath123 ) .",

    "this difference as well as that in amplitude can easily be explained by the change of mass of unstable - equilibrium configuration .",

    "better would be the use of a realistic equation of state ( as in @xcite ) but , for this work , a polytrope gives already good results .",

    "although the gauge choice does not allow any study of the state of the final object , the scalar gravitational wave signals can be obtained and the results compare well with previous ( simplified ) works . from that comparison it can be said that , whereas taking pressure into account , in most cases , does not have significant effects on the signal ( which was to be demonstrated ) , it is the only way to get reliable initial conditions and to trigger the collapse in a `` natural '' way .",
    "doing so helps to get clean waveforms . on the other hand ,",
    "since the complete set of tensor - scalar equations was solved , it was possible to study the effects of coupling function parameters .",
    "mainly , one sees that the outgoing monopolar gravitational wave is very dependent on the coupling function , especially the @xmath107 parameter .",
    "this is interesting because the @xmath118 parameter can be constrained by solar - system experiments , since it represents only a linear deviation from general relativity , whereas @xmath107 can not be really probed by that mean . even if the signal from extra - galactic sources is not strong enough to be detected , it is higher than the quadrupolar one and involves more energy .",
    "it means that , if a quadrupolar wave signal is detected by virgo or ligo , with no monopolar component , then the constrain on tensor - scalar theory will be quite strong",
    ". a future project of study is the supernova collapse and bounce in this framework since , in that case , one has electromagnetic and neutrino signals which make possible the use of even negative results of detection .",
    "i thank thibault damour for suggesting this work , for fruitful discussions and reading of the manuscript .",
    "i am very grateful to eric gourgoulhon for help , discussions and careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed on silicon graphics workstations purchased thanks to the support of the spm department of the cnrs and the institut national des sciences de lunivers .",
    "hereafter , some details of the numerical techniques ( spectral methods ) are described .",
    "more complete explanations can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numerical problem is to solve a set of partial differential equations . for this purpose ,",
    "each field ( or function ) @xmath139 is represented , at a given time @xmath140 , as a truncated series of chebyshev polynomials ( or as a column vector of the coefficients of this series ) .",
    "usual number of coefficients ( or points ) is between 17 and 65 .",
    "then all spatial operators like @xmath141 reduce to matrix multiplications of the set of @xmath142 s coefficients .",
    "constraint equations ( [ e : dmdr ] ) and ( [ e : dnudr ] ) are thus easily integrated .",
    "other operations , like multiplication of two functions , must still be done in the physical space ( at grid s points ) .",
    "evolution equations are written in the form .ft|_t=t_j+1/2=f_t_j+1-f_t_j",
    "t_j+1 -t_j = s(f)_t_j+1/2 [ e : intg ] with @xmath143 being a spatial operator on @xmath142 and @xmath144 being the @xmath145-th instant of integration",
    ". there is need to evaluate @xmath143 at time @xmath146 , which can be done either explicitly ( extrapolated from known quantities at @xmath144 and @xmath147 ) or implicitly ( interpolated from unknown quantity at @xmath148 ) .",
    "explicit integration suffers from the severe courant - friedrich - levy constraint on the time step .",
    "however , in the case of an advection equation ( like ( [ e : dddt ] ) ) , it can be used almost with an arbitrary time step provided that the advection velocity is zero at the edges of the grid ; hence the _ comoving _ grid with the fluid ( see appendix  [ sa : dyn ] ) .",
    "the implicit way requires to write (1-(t_j+1-t_j)2).f_t_j+1=f_t_j + ( t_j+1-t_j)2s(f_t_j ) [ e : intimp ] where the function @xmath142 is represented by its coefficients and with @xmath149 being a matrix , which is inverted to get the solution @xmath150 . in the case where one has to impose boundary conditions , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e : intimp ] ) is replaced by a vector of coefficients containing zeros except on the last or last but one column .",
    "one thus gets a `` free '' solution which can be combined with the first one in order to satisfy boundary conditions .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath151 operator present in eq .",
    "( [ e : intg ] ) is not always linear ( i.e. not represented by a matrix in coefficient space ) . that is the case for the wave equation ( [ e : boxfi ] ) , with a spatial operator of the form @xmath152 .",
    "this equation is then decomposed as follows : @xmath153 and @xmath154 being an approximation of @xmath155 , allowing to write the most important part of the spatial operator in a `` linear '' form . finally , one writes @xmath156 with second - order approximation and @xmath157 to make the integration scheme implicit .",
    "the boundary condition imposed on the outer edge of the grid ( far away from the star ) is that of an _ outgoing wave _ , meaning that the wave can be written as ( t , r ) = _ 0 + 1rf(t - rc ) [ e : ccfi ] which is an exact condition for 1-d waves .",
    "differentiating , one gets  . 1ct + r + ( -_0 ) r | _ = 0 actually , this is not the right boundary condition for a wave equation in curved space - time , however , since the boundary condition is imposed far away from the star ( i.e. on a nearly flat space - time ) , a good approximation is obtained by taking as a boundary condition  . e^-t + r + r | _ = 0 [ e : ccont ]      the integration procedure is quite similar to that of gourgoulhon in @xcite .",
    "all matter and field quantities are supposed to be known at some initial instant @xmath140 , and one wants then to get them at @xmath158 .",
    "first , one can compute the scalar field variables @xmath1 and @xmath159 at that time thanks to wave equation ( [ e : boxfi ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ e : dxidt ] ) . similarly , one gets the fluid quantities @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( and thus @xmath160 ) , @xmath98 and @xmath161 , with their evolution equations ( [ e : dedt ] ) , ( [ e : dudt ] ) , ( [ e : dhdt ] ) and ( [ e : dddt ] ) .",
    "then , one can deduce the metric coefficient @xmath162 through eq .",
    "( [ e : dmdr ] ) and ( [ e : defa ] ) ( the integration constant is obtained by the condition @xmath163 ) ; and determine the fluid proper baryonic density @xmath40 , by inverting relation ( [ e : defd ] ) .",
    "the equation of state then gives the pressure @xmath164 .",
    "finally , one uses eq .",
    "( [ e : dnudr ] ) to obtain @xmath165 , which is determined up to an additive constant .",
    "since there is no birkhoff theorem in scalar - tensor gravity , this constant can not be determined by matching the interior solution to the exterior ( static ) one , used before .",
    "even the exterior space - time is dynamic . using a large grid ( which is going far away from the star , typically @xmath166 ) enables to be in weak - field regime at the outer edge of the grid and so , to write with a good approximation t , a(r_out , t)n(r_out , t ) = k_an [ e : an ] @xmath167 being a constant determined for the static configuration ( @xmath168 for general relativity ) .",
    "one thus gets the integration constant for @xmath165 . observing @xmath169 during the collapse",
    ", one sees that @xmath170 .",
    "this is quite lower than the overall committed error , see appendix  [ sa : test ] . once @xmath30 is obtained , the velocity @xmath66 is deduced and all quantities are known at the instant @xmath171 .",
    "time integration is performed by means of a second - order semi - implicit scheme ( see previous sections ) , boundary conditions being imposed on the @xmath172 system .1r^2r r^2 v|_r = r_star = 0 and on the wave equation ( [ e : ccont ] ) .",
    "contrary to @xcite , the code is working with several domains .",
    "each domain is partly comoving with the fluid , meaning that inside the star , both edges of a domain are comoving , the grid s velocity at each point being ( linearly ) interpolated .",
    "the edge of the outer domain is at rest ( @xmath173 ) , and the grid s velocity between star s surface and this outer edge is interpolated at each point the same way .",
    "typically , two domains have been used for the star s interior and three for the exterior , with about 65 points in each domain , which is considerably lower than the number of points used in finite difference schemes .",
    "a full run , with this multi - domain spectral methods , took about 20 minutes of cpu time on an onyx silicon graphics workstation ( with mips r4400 , 200 mhz processor ) , for @xmath174 time steps .",
    "all equations have been checked using a mathematica algebraic code .",
    "more precisely , the schwartz relation for equations ( [ e : dmdr ] ) and ( [ e : dmdt ] ) @xmath175 has been computed and one then gets @xmath176 which is consistent with ( [ e : boxfi ] ) and ( [ e : dedt ] ) .",
    "finally , setting @xmath177 gives the equations of general relativity as described in @xcite .",
    "for static configurations , the following test was performed : considering the same equation of state as in @xcite ( eos1 in this work ) , the same coupling function ( @xmath178 ) and asymptotic scalar field value ( @xmath179 ) , we obtained the same dependence for the effective scalar coupling constant ( the ratio between the scalar and the gravitational energies ) on the star s baryonic mass ( fig.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we also observed an increase of the maximal gravitational mass of neutron stars , when taking into account the scalar field , as it has been showed in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "the subroutine solving the wave equation has been checked by taking analytical solutions of simpler wave equations = w(t , r)^2 where @xmath180 is a given function , and verifying that the discrepancy between numerical solution and the analytical one goes down as the square of the integration time step ( second order scheme ) . for example , @xmath181 which is solution for @xmath182 , was numerically obtained at @xmath183 relative accuracy , with a time step which is @xmath184 of grid s radius , after @xmath185 iterations . the boundary condition has been checked by looking for the remaining energy of the wave in the grid , after the wave was supposed to be `` gone out '' . with the same time - step as above , and for the usual wave equation ( @xmath186 ) , after @xmath187 integrations , there remained @xmath188 of the initial energy , this amount going down as @xmath189 , for the energy is the `` square '' of the amplitude . as it has been seen in previous sections , a numerical grid partly comoving with the fluid was used . for this purpose , the wave equation have been adapted to such a grid and tested .    finally , during dynamical evolution , a good test of overall accuracy was made by comparing the energy density @xmath37 given by the baryonic density through the equation of state , to that deduced from @xmath54 ( which is an evolved quantity ) .",
    "the same is possible for @xmath98 . on a whole run",
    "this error always stayed @xmath190 .",
    "the conservation of the baryonic number was verified with a relative accuracy better than @xmath191 .",
