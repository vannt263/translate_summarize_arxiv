    "when dealing with the description of scattering amplitudes at very high center  of  mass energies a very useful formalism is the balitsky  fadin ",
    "kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) approach  @xcite . in the regge limit",
    "the dominant degrees of freedom are @xmath0channel `` reggeized '' gluons which interact with each other via standard gluons in the @xmath1channel and a gauge invariant reggeized gluon - reggeized gluon - gluon vertex .",
    "this picture emerges as a consequence of multi  regge kinematics where gluon evolution takes place with ordering in longitudinal components but not in transverse momenta . at very high energies this structure",
    "should be modified to include unitarization corrections .",
    "however , there should be a window at present and future colliders where the bfkl predictions provide a good description of the experimental data .",
    "when terms of the form @xmath2 are resumed we are in the leading ",
    "logarithmic approximation ( lla ) . in this limit",
    "the strong coupling does not run and @xmath3 is a constant parameter .",
    "we should have written @xmath4 but it turns out that in the lla we are free to choose any @xmath5 .",
    "this means that there is a lot of freedom in the lla when trying to fit experimental data .",
    "this theory is much more constrained when we include terms of the form @xmath6 . in this next  to  leading logarithmic approximation ( nlla ) the coupling is allowed to run and the energy scale @xmath5 has to be determined . as a matter of fact , cross sections are constructed to be independent of @xmath5 at nlo .",
    "however , different choices of this scale do affect higher orders in the resummation which might be important when making bfkl predictions .    in the coming sections we discuss several important aspects to take into account when constructing bfkl cross sections beyond the lla . in section  [ coherence ]",
    "we describe final states at small bjorken @xmath7 in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the idea of colour coherence is introduced and its implementation in the ccfm equation discussed .",
    "the predictions for jet rates are the same at lo when the ccfm or bfkl equations are used and we explain why . in section  [ collinear ] it is shown that the region of applicability of multi  regge kinematics can be extended to also include regions with collinear emissions . in this case",
    "there exists an interesting structure at higher orders which can be cast into a bessel function of the first kind accounting for double logarithms in transverse scales .",
    "up to the nlla this double logarithms also appear in the inclusive production of a jet centrality emitted in rapidity at a hadron collider . in this",
    "case impact factors and the emission vertex of the central jet have to modified .",
    "this is explained in some detail in section  [ inclusivejet ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ conformal ] we show how the @xmath8 invariance present in the bfkl hamiltonian for non  zero momentum transfer appears in the azimuthal angle dependence of multijet events . as an example we discuss the case with two hard external scales of mueller  navelet jets at a hadron collider .",
    "in qed coherence suppresses soft bremsstrahlung from electron  positron pairs . in qcd processes such as @xmath9 soft gluons at an angle from one of the fermionic lines larger than the angle of emission in the @xmath10 pair",
    "resolve the total colour charge of the pair .",
    "this is the same as that of the parent gluon and radiation occurs as if the soft gluon was emitted from it .",
    "this `` colour coherence '' can be put as angular ordered sequential gluon emissions .",
    "if the @xmath11 emitted gluon from the proton in dis has energy @xmath12 , then a gluon radiated from it with a fraction @xmath13 of its energy and a transverse momentum @xmath14 has opening angle @xmath15 colour coherence leads to angular ordering with increasing opening angles towards the hard scale ( the photon ) .",
    "we then have @xmath16 , or @xmath17 which reduces to @xmath18 in the limit @xmath19 . in  @xcite the bfkl equation for the unintegrated structure function",
    "was obtained in a form suitable for the study of exclusive observables : @xmath20 @xmath21 is a collinear cutoff , the transverse momentum of the emission , and @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this expression predicts gluon emissions with the virtual corrections summed to all orders .",
    "since @xmath25 is an inclusive structure function , it includes the sum over final states .",
    "after this sum the @xmath21-dependence cancels .    to get the structure function we integrate over @xmath26 : @xmath27 with @xmath28 being each gluon emission",
    "a fixed number @xmath29 of emitted gluons gives @xmath30 the expansion for @xmath31 reads  @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 . therefore : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bfkl anomalous dimension .    including coherence in the bfkl expressions , we get  @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is now the ccfm one @xmath38;~ ~ k_{i } > q_{i}. \\label{constraint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the first emission @xmath39 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath40 is @xmath41 the collinear cutoff is only needed in the first emission since subsequent emissions are regulated by angular ordering .",
    "the rates of emission of a number of gluons with transverse momentum larger than a scale @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , plus any number of unresolved ones , were calculated in  @xcite in the lla to @xmath44 .",
    "it was found that the jet rates both in the bfkl and ccfm approaches are the same : @xmath45 + \\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha}_{s})^{3}}{\\omega^{3}}\\left[\\frac{s^{3}}{6}\\right ] , \\\\    { \\rm 1~jet } & = & \\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha}_{s})}{\\omega}t+\\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha } _ { s})^{2 } } { \\omega^{2}}\\left[ts-\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha}_{s})^{3 } } { \\omega^{3}}\\left[\\frac{1}{3}t^{3}-\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}s+\\frac{1}{2}ts^{2}\\right],\\\\ { \\rm 2~jet } & = & \\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha}_{s})^{2}}{\\omega^{2 } } \\left[t^{2}\\right]+\\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha}_{s})^{3}}{\\omega^{3 } } \\left[t^{2}s-\\frac{7}{6}t^{3}\\right],\\\\ { \\rm 3~jet } & = & \\frac{(2\\bar{\\alpha}_{s})^{3}}{\\omega^{3}}\\left[t^{3}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this holds also to all orders in the coupling  @xcite since a generating function for the jet multiplicity distribution was obtained in  @xcite : @xmath48 where the jet - rate generating function @xmath49 is given by @xmath50^{\\frac{u}{1-u}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the same generating function when coherence is included .",

    "this can be done by changing the description of the evolution from one in terms of rapidities to another in terms of longitudinal momentum fractions of the reggeized gluons .",
