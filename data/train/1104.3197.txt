    "quantum trajectories , such as those due to de broglie and bohm ( dbb ) , floyd , faraggi and matone ( ffm ) , etc . , have gained wide attention @xcite recently . in another attempt ,",

    "these trajectories are obtained by putting @xmath1 in the schrodinger equation , which results in an equation similar to the classical hamilton - jacobi equation , in terms of the generally complex function @xmath2 . instead of using the hamilton - jacobi formalism ( where one must use the jacobi s theorem to obtain trajectories , as in classical mechanics and the ffm trajectory representation @xcite ) , an equation of motion @xcite    @xmath3",

    "our attempt in this paper is to find the nature of classical correspondence at the level of quantum trajectories of particles in coherent states @xcite ( denoted as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a complex parameter ) , moving in potentials such as the harmonic oscillator , infinite potential well , a symmetric poschl - teller ( pt ) potential etc .",
    "it is found that the mdbb representation has the surprising feature of identical classical and quantum trajectories for harmonic oscillator coherent states .",
    "for the coherent state of the infinite potential well , one can observe this feature in the limit of high @xmath8 .",
    "but for the pt potential , such a conclusion can not be made .",
    "however , here too a periodic motion for the particle results as @xmath0 .",
    "since the mdbb quantum trajectories are in a complex plane , the demonstration of identical quantum and classical trajectories is to be made in the complex plane .",

    "we note that in the real case , classical simple harmonic oscillators can , at best , be stationary only at the equilibrium point @xmath61 and that the above feature of stationary particles at all values of @xmath58 is unnatural in the classical limit . on the other hand , the mdbb trajectories in the coherent state correspond to the complex classical trajectories in every respect . even for @xmath46",

    "often in conventional dbb scheme , the stationarity of particles in bound eigenstates is justified as an instance which demands a new ` quantum intuition ' , but the above mentioned failure to exhibit correspondence with classical motion , even for coherent states , is indeed a setback for the formalism .    by using numerical methods the complex trajectories for the harmonic oscillator in a coherent state with @xmath63",

    "( [ fig : infwel_coh02456 ] ) . in this numerical approach , we have included terms up to @xmath79 in the expansion ( [ eq : coh_infwel ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note the presence of almost straight trajectories parallel to the real axis , as in the case of classical complex trajectory solutions of free particles ( sec .",
    "2 ) . but near the turning points , the trajectories are more like those near the turning points of classical symmetric poschl - teller potentials . in this case , deviations from the classically expected straight line trajectories ( mentioned above ) at the inner region do not seem to arise from truncation errors in the numerical method . this can be seen by varying the number of terms in the series ( [ eq : coh_infwel ] ) .",
    "the curves are the same even if we include only terms up to @xmath65 . but drawing trajectories for much larger values of @xmath80 than that given in fig .",

    "in addition , we consider a shifted hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath85    solving the schrodinger equation with the boundary condition @xmath86 , the normalised eigenstates can be found as    @xmath87^{-1/2 } \\cos^{l}(x)\\sin^{l } ( x ) \\ ; \\mbox{$_2$f$_1$}(-n , n+2l;l + ( 1/2);\\sin^2x).\\ ] ]    here we choose @xmath88 .",
    "the coherent states are defined by @xcite    @xmath89    where @xmath90 .",
    "the complex quantum trajectories , evaluated numerically with @xmath78 , a value of @xmath91 and for different initial points are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pt_coh3 ] ) .",
    "terms up to @xmath65 are included in the series .",
    "[ ht ]    these trajectories are not identical to those of the corresponding classical case ; i.e. , there is no congruence with the classical trajectories in this case .",
    "however , some interesting features of these trajectories may be noted .",
    "first , for initial points close to the boundary of the potential , they spiral inwards with a period ; i.e. , the maximum displacements from the centre to either side on the real and imaginary axes decrease with each cycle .",
    "this can be seen clearly from the first trajectory in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pt_coh3 ] ) , which has starting point @xmath92 .",
    "when the initial point is nearer to the bottom of the potential , such as @xmath93 = 0.67 shown in the second figure , we have a star - shaped trajectory .",
    "the point @xmath94 is special for the case of @xmath91 , since it leads to an almost circular trajectory in the complex plane and the particle remains in it for ever .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we follow the trajectory for large @xmath95 , the pattern evolves with time and passes through these different phases .",
    "thus the trajectory in the third panel is the final one , in the limit @xmath0 , for whatever initial point one starts with .",
    "in particular , we have observed that the trajectory with the initial point @xmath92 , drawn in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pt_coh3 ] ) , approaches this final shape asymptotically . during this process , also its orientation changed from anti - clockwise to clockwise and period changed from @xmath96 to @xmath97 . including only terms up to @xmath98 does not significantly affect the shape of this or neighboring trajectories .",
    "hence we conclude that also in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pt_coh3 ] ) , the shape of the trajectories do not arise from truncation errors . for values of @xmath80",
    "much larger than that in this figure , the trajectories can not be drawn since they are not confined to the physically limited interval of @xmath99 .",
    "this may be due to the error in truncation .",
    "using the mdbb approach , we have illustrated that the coherent state trajectories of the harmonic oscillator are identical to the complex classical trajectories .",
    "this feature is not restricted to high energies alone .",
    "such congruence is as yet reported only in the mdbb quantum trajectory representation .",
    "the analysis is extended to potentials such as an infinite well and a symmetric poschl - teller potential .",
    "we have used numerical methods for the plotting of complex trajectories in such cases .",
    "it is found that for a particle trapped in an infinite potential well , the coherent state complex trajectories partly agree with the classical solutions . for large values of the parameter @xmath80 ,",
    "the agreement becomes almost perfect when initial points are located close to the turning points . on the other hand , for the pt potential ,",
    "no congruence is observed and hence no exact classical correspondence can be claimed .",
    "but we find that also these complex trajectories become periodic as @xmath100 .",
    "exploring the classical correspondence of coherent states at the level of quantum trajectories is capable of revealing more information on the fundamental nature of such coherent states .",
    "it is interesting to note how the individual eigenstates which lead to trajectories in fig.([fig : infwel_qm01234 ] ) combine to form a coherent state with quantum trajectories shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : infwel_coh02456 ] ) , that at least partly agree with the classical solutions .",
    "similarly , the eigenstates of poschl - teller potential combine to form coherent states having trajectories that correspond to periodic classical trajectories . in general , all such trajectories have very interesting properties , which makes the method a potential tool in analysing the properties of generalised coherent states .",
