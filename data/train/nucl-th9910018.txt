    "discovery of cp symmetry breaking in k - meson decay stimulated a search of t- and cp- non - invariant interactions in other systems .",
    "it is important to distinguish t- p- breaking interaction from t - breaking p - conserving one . while t - odd p - odd interaction naturally arises in the standard model through cp - breaking phase of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix or in qcd through @xmath0 term , introduction of t - breaking p - conserving interactions has no natural implementation on a quark level .",
    "the investigation of p - even t - odd interaction ( trv ) of non - weak origin continue to enjoy popularity in nuclear and nucleon - nucleon physics .",
    "note , that the t - breaking , p - conserving interaction arising from interference of t- p- breaking interaction with p - odd weak one , should be very small and can not be considered .",
    "null test for the t - odd p - even interaction is finding of the @xmath1 term @xcite in the forward elastic scattering amplitude of the particle with the @xmath2 spin by the nucleus with the spin @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the nucleus spin operator , @xmath5 is the unit vector in the direction of the projectile particle momentum , @xmath6 is the pauli matrix of the nucleon spin .",
    "the heavy nuclei exhibit the large enhancement of p - odd effects but for t - odd p - even interactions the enhancement can be suppressed @xcite .",
    "so , the advantage of heavy nuclei compared to light is questionable . on the other hand , the proton - deuteron scattering considered here fully utilise a high luminosity of proton beams of cosy .",
    "such an experiment is planed to be performed by trv collaboration @xcite as an internal target experiment in the cooler synchrotron cosy .",
    "we consider the t - violating p - conserving p - d forward scattering amplitude in the frame of the glauber multiscattering theory proceeding from t - odd , p - even terms of n - n interaction .",
    "the n - n forward elastic scattering amplitude does not contain t - odd , p - even terms : such a term exists in scattering amplitude only at non - zero angles .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath7-term arising is double proton scattering by deuteron nucleons . in the first collision",
    "the proton is scattered by trv interaction at a small angle @xmath8 and in the second collision it is scattered by t - even interaction at the angle @xmath9 , as a result , the t - odd , p - even term appears at the forward @xmath10 elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "the problem is discussed earlier @xcite , but we now take into account the deuteron non sphericity and calculate the contribution of the t - odd impurity at the deuteron density matrix .",
    "the glauber multiscattering theory can be generalized to the case of particles with spins @xcite .",
    "let us consider the small - angle elastic scattering of the particle with spin by the @xmath11 scatterers also with spins and fixed at the points with the radius vectors @xmath12 .",

    "we come to @xmath20 equation ( [ vz ] ) is analogous to to the interaction representation in the quantum field theory and consequently it has solution @xmath21 being analogy to the @xmath22 : @xmath23 for the scattering amplitude we have : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum transferred .",
    "if @xmath26 and @xmath27 is concentrated near the point @xmath28 so that the different @xmath29 do not overlap it is possible to write : @xmath30 the operator @xmath31 orders the terms in this product in the direction of @xmath28 increasing from the right side to the left one . by denoting @xmath32 we find @xmath33 @xmath34 means the averaging over the displacements and the spin states of the scatterers in the target nucleus",
    ". remember that the @xmath31 orders the terms in the direction of @xmath28 increasing .",
    "in view of absence of the fundamental model the t - odd p - even interaction is usually considered at the nucleon level in the framework of one meson exchange mechanism which is responsible for the long range component of nuclear forces . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two easiest mesons , exchange of which can results to the t - odd p - even n - n scattering amplitude @xcite . the lagrangian of the interaction of @xmath35 and @xmath37 fields with nucleon field can be written down as @xcite @xmath38 the one meson exchange corresponds to the diagrams in fig .",

    "the profile - function @xmath81 is connected with the @xmath82 nucleon scattering amplitude by the relation : @xmath83 .",
    "if we rewrite the equation ( [ f20 ] ) in terms of amplitudes and form factors @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 we can see that in the expression derived @xmath87 the area of integration over the momentum transferred @xmath88 is restricted by the deuteron form factor , which dependence on the momentum transferred is sharper than that for @xmath82 scattering amplitude .",
    "it allows one to take out the @xmath82 amplitude from the integral or , that is equivalent , to use the formal profile - function giving the correct expression for the @xmath82 amplitude in a vicinity of small angles : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is two demensional delta - function , @xmath91 is the nucleon mass .",
    "although the approximation is very rough , especially for the spin - dependent form factors @xmath92 @xcite , we use it to simplify calculations .",
