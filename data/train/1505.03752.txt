    "recently , origami has attracted a significant amount of attention from researchers due to its unique mechanical properties .",
    "the most evident one is its compactness and deployability , which enables various types of expandable engineering structures , e.g. , space solar sails  @xcite and solar arrays  @xcite .",
    "biological systems also exploit such compact origami patterns , such as foldable tree leaves for metabolic purposes  @xcite and stent grafts @xcite .",
    "another useful aspect of origami - based structures is that origami patterns can enhance static mechanical properties of structures .",
    "for instance , structural bending rigidity for thin - walled cylindrical structures can be significantly improved by imposing origami - patterns  @xcite .",
    "these origami patterns are used not only for space structures , but also in commercial products ( e.g. , beverage cans ) in order to reduce the thickness of thin - walled structures without sacrificing their buckling strength  @xcite . within the considerable progress made in the mechanics of origami - based structures ,",
    "however , the primary focus has been placed on the static or quasi - static properties of origami .",
    "for example , recent studies attempted to fabricate origami - based metamaterials with an eye towards investigating the deployable , auxetic , and bistable nature of origami structures  @xcite .",
    "limited work has been reported on the impact response of origami - based structures  @xcite , and their wave dynamics is relatively unexplored .",
    "plausibly , this lack of studies on the dynamics of origami - based structures can be attributed to the intrinsic characteristic of typical origami structures , which exhibit limited degrees of freedom ( dof ) during their folding / unfolding motions .",
    "this is particularly true for rigid origami , in which the deformation takes place only along crease lines while origami facets remain rigid in dynamic conditions .",
    "the rigid origami features single - dof motions ideally , and thus , the studies on their wave dynamics have been more or less absent under this rigid foldability assumption .        in this study , we use a single - dof rigid origami structure as a building block to assemble multi - dof mechanical metamaterials , and analyze their nonlinear wave dynamics through analytical and numerical approaches . specifically , we employ the tachi - miura polyhedron ( tmp )  @xcite as a unit cell of the metamaterial as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tmp_metamaterials ] .",
    "the tmp cell is made of two adjoined sheets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tmp_metamaterials](a ) ) , and changes its shape from a vertically standing planar body to a horizontally flattened one while taking up a finite volume between the two phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tmp_metamaterials](b ) ) .",
    "this volumetric behavior is in contrast to conventional origami - patterns that feature planar architectures and in - plane motions ( e.g. , miura - ori sheets   @xcite ) . in this study , we first characterize the kinematics of the tmp cell , showing that it exhibits controllable strain - softening behavior . by cross - linking these tmp unit cells in a horizontal layer and stacking them up vertically with separators , we form a multi - dof metamaterial as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tmp_metamaterials](c ) .",
    "we then conduct analytical and numerical studies to verify that these multi - dof origami structures can support a nonlinear stress wave in the form of a so - called rarefaction wave , owing to the strain softening nature of the assembled structure . the rarefaction wave , which can be viewed as an acoustic variant of a depression wave @xcite , has been studied in various settings , including systems of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was proposed in the context of discrete systems with strain - softening behavior @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these rarefaction waves feature tensile wavefronts despite the application of compressive stresses upon external impact ( see the conceptual illustrations in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmp_metamaterials](c ) ) . in that light , they are fundamentally different from the commonly encountered dynamical response of nonlinear elastic chains which support weakly or even strongly nonlinear traveling compression waves  @xcite . recently , in a quite different setting of tensegrity structures , rarefaction waves have been identified computationally in the elastic softening regime  @xcite .",
    "our main scope within the present work is to verify the formation and propagation of rarefaction waves in origami - based metamaterials via two simplified models : a multi - bar linkage model and a lumped mass model . in both cases , we confirm that the origami structure disintegrates strong impact excitations by forming rarefaction waves , followed by other dispersive wave patterns to be discussed in more detail below .",
    "we also validate the nonlinear nature of the stress waves by calculating the variations of wave speed as a function of external force amplitude .",
    "notably , we observe the reduction of wave speed as the excitation amplitude increases , which is in sharp contrast to conventional nonlinear waves seen in nature or engineered systems  @xcite . in the case of the lumped mass model , we find numerically exact traveling waves .",
    "we provide a precise characterization of the wave speed and amplitude relationship and a way to evaluate the robustness of the rarefaction waves through dynamical stability computations . the findings in this study",
    "provide a foundation for building a new type of impact mitigating structure with tunable characteristics , which does not rely on material damping or plastic deformation .",
    "this study also offers a platform for exciting the rarefaction pulse  a far less explored type of traveling wave  and examining its characteristics in considerable detail .",

    "the left end of the linkage structure is supported by a roller joint , which is allowed to move only along the _",
    "z_-axis up on the application of external force @xmath9 .",
    "the right end is fixed by a pin joint .",
    "therefore , the inclined angle of the linkage , @xmath4 , is the only parameter required to describe the motion of this unit - cell system .",
    "this corresponds to the single - dof nature of the tmp cell .    by using the principle of virtual power @xcite",

    "the interpretation of origami dynamics via this nonlinear lumped mass system opens up a broad , novel potential vein of studies . indeed , one advantage of modeling the origami lattice in this way is that many tools and results obtained in the context of granular crystals can be applied in our setting .",
    "for example , the recent work of  @xcite examined a one - dimensional discrete system under the power - law relationship of strain - softening springs ( i.e. , @xmath35 in eq .  ) .",
    "this study reported the propagation of rarefaction waves through dynamic simulations and a long wavelength approximation , where it was shown that the width of the rarefaction wave is independent of the wave speed .",
    "likewise , the analysis of nonlinear waves in post - buckled structures has been also attempted using a similar discrete system  @xcite . in this article , we extend the theoretical results in such nonlinear - spring systems by introducing a systematic tool for the computation of numerically exact traveling waves , which will be discussed in sec",
    ".  [ sec_iv ] .",
    "we also address the subject of their dynamical stability in the supplemental material  @xcite .",
    "to examine the dynamic characteristics of the origami - based structure and compare the results from the two reduced models , we conduct numerical computations of wave propagation under a compressive impact . also , we apply various amplitudes of impact force to the multi - bar linkage model in order to examine the speed of both compressive and tensile strain waves , especially focusing on the dominant traveling wave .",

[",
    "fig : sim_results_case2 ] ) . it should be also noted that due to the strain - softening behavior , the amplitude of the compressive force is reduced drastically as the wave propagates along the chain . since both the multi - bar linkage model and the lumped mass model",
    "have this strain - softening nature , the same type of rarefaction waves is observed .",
    "in addition , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_results_case2](c ) shows the magnified view of the leading edge of the propagating strain wave .",
    "this leading wave is created due to the effect of inertia in the multi - bar linkage model .",
    "that is , when the first unit cell folds right after the compressive impact , the second unit cell is pulled by the first unit cell before the compressive force propagates to the next unit cell .",
    "therefore , the tensile strain appears in front of the first compressive wave in the multi - bar linkage model . comparing the numerical results of the two models ,",
    "the lumped mass model captures the multi - bar linkage model dynamics even quantitatively at short times , while the agreement between the two becomes qualitative at longer time scales .",

    "these wavepackets apparently travel maximally with the speed of sound in the medium , while the rarefaction pulse outrunning them is apparently supersonic .",
    "we will return to this point to corroborate it further by our numerical bifurcation analysis in the next section .",
    "additionally , it should be noted that in the lumped mass model , highly localized structures with a clear envelope can be discerned ( see e.g. , the vicinity of unit number 150 of the @xmath53 ms panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : sim_results_case2](b ) also seems to suggest that such coherent wavepackets travel more slowly than the dispersive radiation .",
    "the multi - bar linkage model also exhibits such time - periodic patterns , but there is no clear signature of spatial localization . while these nonlinear wave structures are worth investigating , this topic is beyond the scope of this paper , and we do not explore them further here .",
    "the propagation speed of strain waves is now investigated numerically under various amplitudes of impact force .",
    "the wave speed is approximated as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the initial height of the unit cell , and @xmath56 is the time span in which the strain wave propagates from the first unit cell to the @xmath16-th unit cell ( see fig .  [",

    "the propagating wave speeds calculated are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavespeed_calculation](b ) under three different initial folding angles : @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "it is evident that the wave speed is altered by the impact force , which is one of characteristics of nonlinear waves .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the compressive regime , the wave speed decreases as the compressive impact increases .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to conventional nonlinear waves formed in the system of strain - hardening lattices  @xcite .",
    "a different trend is observed in the tensile regime , where the wave speed increases as the tensile impact increases .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the wave speed curve can be shifted by changing the initial folding angle .",
    "therefore , we can control the speed of the waves propagating through the origami - based metamaterials by altering their geometrical configurations , implying their inherent dynamical tunability .",
    "we now turn our attention to a more systematic analysis and understanding of the rarefaction waves in the simpler lumped mass model ; notably , our conclusions here in that regard are of broader interest to previously discussed settings such as those of  @xcite . based on the previous analysis , we numerically investigate the existence and dynamical stability of exact rarefaction waves of the lumped mass model [ cf .",

    "it is not surprising then that our parametric continuation in the wave speed @xmath61 reveals a critical minimum value @xmath87 m / s , which is the sound speed of the chain ( see the vertical dashed - dot gray line of fig .  [ fig6c ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the long - wavelength analysis of @xcite and also with our observations of the previous section indicating that the wave outruns the small amplitude radiation tails behind it .",
    "thus , similarly to systems with @xmath88 @xcite , the rarefaction waves of the origami lattice are traveling faster than any linear waves of the system .",
    "however , in contrast to solitary waves in systems with @xmath88 , the amplitude of the rarefaction waves in the origami system have a natural bound determined by the precompression @xmath27 of the system , in which case the particles come out of contact ( see the horizontal dashed black line of fig .

    "the dynamical features observed herein may constitute a highly useful feature towards the efficient mitigation of impact by converting compressive waves into rarefaction waves and disintegrating high - amplitude impulses into small - amplitude oscillatory wave patterns .",
    "we also demonstrated the potential tunability of the wave speed by altering initial folding conditions of the origami - based structure , which naturally opens up the feasibility of controlling stress wave propagation in an efficient manner .",
    "the rather unique nonlinear wave dynamics of origami structures can lead to a wide range of applications , such as tunable wave transmission channels and deployable impact mitigating layers for space and other engineering applications . on the theoretical / computational side , there is also a large number of intriguing questions that are emerging . for one , a more detailed comparison of the coherent structure propagation in the multi - bar linkage model vs. that of the lumped - mass model would be an interesting topic for further consideration . this would help uncover the dynamical features leading to the apparent weak amplitude decay in the former , while the latter contains robust solutions and sustained long - time propagation .",
    "still at the single wave level , an exploration of the delicate issues of spectral stability by means of different numerical methods and of the corresponding dynamical implications would be of particular interest .",

    "<S> we investigate the nonlinear wave dynamics of origami - based metamaterials composed of tachi - miura polyhedron ( tmp ) unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> these cells exhibit strain softening behavior under compression , which can be tuned by modifying their geometrical configurations or initial folded conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we assemble these tmp cells into a cluster of origami - based metamaterials , and we theoretically model and numerically analyze their wave transmission mechanism under external impact . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations show that origami - based metamaterials can provide a prototypical platform for the formation of nonlinear coherent structures in the form of rarefaction waves , which feature a tensile wavefront upon the application of compression to the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the existence of numerically exact traveling rarefaction waves . </S>",
    "<S> origami - based metamaterials can be highly useful for mitigating shock waves , potentially enabling a wide variety of engineering applications . </S>"
