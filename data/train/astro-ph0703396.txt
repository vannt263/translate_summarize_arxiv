    "the periodic light variations are a common feature among the magnetic cp stars .",
    "it is believed that most of these variations are caused by the rotational modulation of the observed radiative flux due to spots of a different peculiar chemical composition present on the stellar surface . in @xcite",
    "we investigated the effect of the uneven surface distribution of helium on the monochromatic emergent flux and showed that the distribution of the flux may be changed by the bound - free processes . in this work",
    "we calculate the light curves of helium - strong cp star hd  37776using the spectroscopically derived surface distribution of helium and silicon by @xcite . to study the influence of the chemical peculiarity on the observed light variability besides helium we selected silicon as : ( i ) it is overabundant for a large group of chemically peculiar stars that show light variations ( e.g. , si , he - weak , and he - strong stars ) , and these stars form a photometrically homogeneous group ; ( ii ) a large overabundance of silicon is observed on the hd  37776  surface .",
    "given the map of the helium and silicon surface distribution we computed the emergent flux for the every surface element , sized @xmath1 , and then integrated over the all visible surface .",
    "the fluxes were computed using synspec , the code for spectrum synthesis , for @xmath2 lte models computed with tlusty ( @xcite ) for different silicon and helium abundance from the grid @xmath3}=-3 , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 $ ] and @xmath4}=-5 ,   -4 , -3 , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 $ ]   to cover the extent of values given by @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath5 and surface gravity @xmath6 of the models are the same ( see tab .  [ hvezpar ] ) .",
    "the atomic species and the number of their energy levels included in the model atmosphere calculations are listed in tab .",
    "[ ionpar ] .",
    ".parameters of hd  37776 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     we calculate the flux from model atmosphere for given silicon and helium abundances @xmath7,[si / h]})$ ] .",
    "the flux @xmath8,[si / h]})$ ] in the color @xmath9 is obtained as a convolution of @xmath7,[si / h]})$ ] with a gauss profile peaked at the central wavelength of the color @xmath10 , with dispersion @xmath11 .",
    "the radiative flux in the color @xmath12 from individual surface elements @xmath13 ( @xmath14 are spherical coordinates on the stellar surface ) is obtained by interpolation of fluxes from the model grid . finally , the total observed radiative flux is calculated as the integral over all the visible surface elements @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the angle between normal to the surface element and line of sight , and @xmath17 describes the adopted linear limb darkening ) and the observed magnitude difference is then @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a reference flux .",
    "this was performed for @xmath20 rotational phases ( some of them are shown on fig .",
    "[ povrch ] ) .",
    "the plot of the radiative flux calculated for different values of the silicon abundance ( fig .",
    "[ toky ] ) shows that stellar surface in silicon rich regions is brighter in the _ uvby _ colors than in the silicon poor ones .",
    "the increase of the flux in the optical domain is caused by the flux redistribution from the far uv region mainly due to the enhanced silicon bound - free absorption .",
    "at different rotational phases , surface elements with different silicon abundance are seen on the stellar disc . during the light maximum around the phase @xmath21 ( see also fig .  [ hvvel ] )",
    "the si rich regions are seen , which have large flux in the _ uvby _ ( see fig .",
    "[ toky ] ) . during the light minimum around the phase @xmath22 the si poor regions are seen on the stellar disc , which have lower flux in the _ uvby_.",
    "due to the uneven surface distribution of silicon ( and partly also due to helium ) the emergent monochromatic flux varies with the location on the visible disc . as shown in fig .",
    "[ toky ] , the si rich regions are brighter in the _ uvby _ colors ( the brightness temperature is higher ) , whereas si poor regions are darker .    using the model atmosphere fluxes derived for the different helium and silicon abundances we calculated the theoretical light curves ( see fig .",
    "[ hvvel ] ) and compared them with the observed ones .",
    "the observed light variations can be explained as alternation of the emergent flux due to the uneven surface distribution of silicon and helium .",
    "we are able to simulate the light variations of the he - strong cp star hd  37776assuming that the light variations are due to the uneven surface distribution of silicon and helium .",
    "the silicon and helium spots modify the emergent flux mainly due to bound - free transitions .",
    "the predicted light curves reproduce the observed ones very well in their overall shape and amplitude .",
    "we stress that the theoretical light curves were obtained from the spectroscopical silicon surface distribution without using any free parameter .",
    "we were able for the first time ( to our knowledge ) to simulate the light curve of a cp star . due to the satisfactorily good agreement between the observed and predicted light variations",
    "we conclude that this modelling is a very promising way towards the explanation of the light variations of chemically peculiar stars .",
