    "within the last decade , a new research field has developed at the interface of many - body theory and first principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "the aim is the construction of materials - specific parameter - free many - body theories that preserve the _ ab initio _ nature of density functional based methods , but incorporate at the same time a many - body description of coulomb interactions beyond the independent - electron picture into computational approaches for spectroscopic or finite - temperature properties .    historically , the first non - perturbative electronic structure techniques for correlated materials evolved from many - body treatments of the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian with realistic parameters",
    ". the general strategy of these so - called `` lda++ '' approaches @xcite ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) consists in the extraction of the parameters of a many - body hamiltonian from first principles calculations and then solving the problem by many - body techniques . in practice , this procedure has met tremendous success in the description of the electronic structure of correlated materials , for a wide range of materials , from transition metals @xcite , their oxides @xcite , sulphides @xcite , or silicides @xcite , to @xmath3-electron compounds @xcite .",
    "more recently , iron pnictide compounds ( see e.g.   refs .  ) or spin - orbit materials @xcite have come into the focus of many - body electronic structure calculations , emphasizing the need for fully _ ab initio _ techniques , including a first principles description of the effective coulomb interactions .",
    "the challenge here is an accurate description of screening of low - energy interactions by high - energy degrees of freedom , as well as the screening of local interactions by nonlocal charge fluctuations @xcite .    despite the tremendous success of lda++ schemes ,",
    "one should be aware of the fact that the ambiguities in the construction of the hamiltonian are not limited to the many - body part : not even the use of the kohn - sham band structure of dft as a starting hamiltonian has a direct microscopic justification beyond heuristic arguments . though renormalization group techniques suggest that in many cases the relevant low - energy effective hamiltonian can indeed be cast into a generalized ( multi - orbital ) hubbard form , in practice neither the precise form nor the parameters can be derived directly from the coulomb hamiltonian in the continuum . in this sense ,",
    "the construction of an `` lda++ '' hamiltonian amounts to a rather _ ad hoc _ combination of a kohn - sham hamiltonian and multi - orbital hubbard ( and hund ) interaction terms for a subset of `` correlated orbitals '' .",
    "conceptually , there is moreover a mismatch arising from the fact that the full long - range coulomb interactions enter the one - particle part of the hamiltonian ( even if only in a mean - field fashion ) , while in the many - body part they are replaced by effective local interactions acting only in a low - energy subspace .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "the first ",
    "well - known one  is related to the double counting correction : correlation effects accounted for in the exchange - correlation potential of dft have to be subtracted . yet",
    ", a microscopically motivated definition of this term is , even on a conceptual level , impossible .",
    "the second one is more subtle , and has only recently started to receive some attention : in fact , the same processes that screen the effective coulomb interactions are also responsible for renormalizations of the one - body part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this can be understood from an analysis of screening as resulting from coupling of the electrons to bosonic excitations , such as plasmons , particle - hole excitations or more complex many - body processes .",
    "the diagonalization of the corresponding electron - boson hamiltonian results in fermionic quasi - particles ( `` electronic polarons '' ) corresponding to electrons dressed by their screening bosons , and thus having heavier masses .",
    "this mass enhancement corresponds to an effective renormalization of their kinetic energy , and hence of the one - body part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this kind of effect has recently been demonstrated explicitly @xcite on the basis of the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa ) , which allows for an explicit ( yet approximate ) estimation of dynamical hubbard interactions in solids @xcite .",
    "the corresponding one - body renormalizations have been investigated in the framework of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) for srvo@xmath0 @xcite and bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite , and a low - energy effective hamiltonian comprising these renormalizations has been derived in ref .  .",
    "in addition to these effects related to the long - range nature of the coulomb interactions and the resulting quantum dynamical screening , in practice , yet another difficulty arises when proceeding to ( approximate ) many - body solutions of the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , while the construction of the one - body part of the hamiltonian ( within dft ) naturally puts the electronic density at the center of the attention , many - body theory is most readily formulated within a green s function language .",
    "this mismatch in language is the final capstone that ensures that matching contributions between the effective one - body hamiltonian and the many - body terms are truly impossible to identify .",
    "ideally , the desired specifications of new many - body electronic structure techniques beyond `` lda++ '' approaches can thus be summarized in three main requirements :    * the theory should be entirely formulated in the green s function language , even at the one - body level .",
    "* the theory should deal directly with the long - range coulomb interactions , and any effective local `` hubbard - like '' interactions should arise only as intermediate auxiliary quantities .",
    "* at the same time , the theory should retain the non - perturbative character of dynamical mean field theory , thus avoiding limitations due to a truncation of the perturbation series .",
    "this latter point is essential to ensure the scheme to be equally appropriate in the weak , strong and intermediate coupling regimes .",
    "the combination of hedin s _ gw _ approximation  many - body perturbation theory to first order in the screened coulomb interaction @xmath5  and dynamical mean field theory meets these criteria .",
    "such a scheme was proposed a decade ago @xcite , based on the construction of the free energy of a solid as a functional of the green s function @xmath6 and @xmath5 .    only very recently have practical implementations for real materials been achieved@xcite that go beyond simple static approximation schemes @xcite .",
    "the reason was the necessity of dealing with frequency - dependent interactions at the dmft level , which has remained a major bottleneck until recently .",
    "recent advances in monte carlo techniques@xcite and the invention of a reliable cumulant - type scheme , the `` bose factor ansatz '' @xcite , have unblocked the situation : two calculations within _ gw_+dmft taking into account dynamical interactions have been achieved recently , for srvo@xmath0 @xcite and for systems of adatoms on surfaces @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we review and extend the former calculations , giving a detailed account of fully dynamical _",
    "gw_+dmft calculations for srvo@xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "ii , we give an extensive summary of the concepts of the combined _",
    "gw_+dmft scheme and discuss aspects of its practical implementation , in particular related to the bose factor ansatz .",
    "furthermore , we devote an extensive discussion to the question of how to treat multi - orbital materials : we propose that for ligand and conduction band shells a perturbative treatment might be sufficient , and show how such a procedure can be combined with the non - perturbative dmft treatment of the low - energy correlated shells . in sect .",
    "iii , we review the electronic structure of our target compound , pointing out problems left open within conventional lda++ schemes .",
    "section iv presents the results of fully dynamical _",
    "gw_+dmft calculations , in comparison to _ gw _ calculations , lda+dmft with static and dynamic interactions , and to simplified combinations of _ gw _ and dmft which allow for a detailed analysis of the importance of the different terms entering the theory .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section v , before arriving at our conclusions in sect .",
    "the starting point of the _ gw_+dmft scheme is hedin s _ gw _ approximation ( gwa)@xcite , in which the self - energy of a quantum many - body system is obtained from a frequency convolution ( or product in time ) of the green s function g with the screened coulomb interaction @xmath7 . the dielectric function @xmath8 , which screens the bare coulomb potential @xmath9 , is  within a pure _ gw _ scheme  obtained from the random phase approximation .",
    "the _ gw_+dmft scheme , as proposed in @xcite , combines the first principles description of screening inherent in _ gw _ methods with the non - perturbative nature of dmft , where local quantities such as the local green s function are calculated to all orders in the interaction from an effective reference system ( impurity model ) . in dmft ,",
    "one imposes a self - consistency condition for the one - particle green s function , namely , that its on  site projection equals the impurity green s function . in _",
    "gw_+dmft , the self - consistency requirement is generalized to encompass also two - particle quantities , namely , the local projection of the screened interaction is required to equal the impurity screened interaction .",
    "this in principle promotes the hubbard u from an adjustable parameter in dmft techniques to a self - consistent auxiliary function that incorporates long - range screening effects in an _ ab initio _ fashion .",
    "indeed , as already alluded to above , not only higher energy degrees of freedom can be downfolded into an effective dynamical interaction , but one can also aim at incorporating nonlocal screening effects into an effective dynamical @xmath10 .",
    "the theory is then free of any hubbard _ parameter _ , and the interactions are directly determined from the full long - range coulomb interactions in the continuum .    from a formal point of view ,",
    "the _ gw_+dmft method , as introduced in @xcite , corresponds to a specific approximation to the correlation part of the free energy of a solid , expressed as a functional of the green s function g and the screened coulomb interaction w : the nonlocal part is taken to be the first order term in @xmath5 , while the local part is calculated from a local impurity model as in ( extended ) dynamical mean field theory .",
    "this leads to a set of self - consistent equations for the green s function @xmath6 , the screened coulomb interaction @xmath5 , the self - energy @xmath11 and the polarization @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "specifically , the self - energy is obtained as @xmath13 , where the local part @xmath14 is derived from the impurity model . in practice , however , the calculation of a self - energy for ( rather delocalized ) s- or p - orbitals has never been performed within dmft , and it appears to be more physical to approximate this part also by a _",
    "gw_-like expression . for these reasons ref .   proposed a practical scheme , in which only the local part of the self - energy of the correlated  orbitals is calculated from the impurity model and all other local and nonlocal components are approximated by their first order expressions in @xmath5 .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we first briefly summarize the functional formulation of the _ gw _ , dmft and _",
    "gw_+dmft schemes from a general point of view ( section [ unified ] ) .",
    "the corresponding _",
    "gw_+dmft equations are summarized in appendix a. sections [ orbital - separation ] and [ orbsepeqns ] are devoted to the `` orbital - separated scheme '' implemented for srvo@xmath0 , defining the equations solved in practice .",
    "we then review the dynamic atomic limit approximation for the solution of dynamical impurity models ( section [ dala ] ) , while section [ technical ] summarizes some technicalities .      within the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the electronic many - body states in a solid are determined by the eigenstates of the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath15 where the first two terms denote the kinetic energy part and one - body potential created by the ions respectively .",
    "the last term , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the matrix elements of the coulomb interaction in the continuum , denotes the electron - electron interaction .",
    "following almbladh _",
    "et al._@xcite , the free energy of a solid can be formulated as a functional @xmath18 $ ] of the green s function @xmath6 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath5 of the solid .",
    "the latter is defined as the correlation function of bosonic excitations corresponding to density fluctuations , that is , in mathematical terms , as the propagator of the hubbard - stratonovich field decoupling the coulomb interaction term .",
    "the _ gw _ method , dynamical mean field theory and the combined _",
    "gw_+dmft scheme can then be viewed as different approximations to this @xmath18 $ ] functional .",
    "the functional @xmath19 can trivially be split into a hartree part @xmath20 and a many body correction @xmath21 , which contains all corrections beyond the hartree approximation  : @xmath22 .",
    "the hartree part can be given in the form @xmath23 & = & tr\\ln g - tr[({g_h}^{-1}-g^{-1})g ] \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2}tr\\ln w+\\frac{1}{2}tr[({v_q}^{-1}-w^{-1})w ] \\label{lw}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 being the hartree green s function , and @xmath25 the fourier transform of the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "the @xmath21-functional is the sum of all skeleton diagrams that are irreducible with respect to both one - electron propagator and interaction lines .",
    "@xmath26 $ ] has the following properties : @xmath27 the @xmath21 functional was first derived in @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion in the context of extended dmft can be found in ref .  , while refs .",
    "view it from the _",
    "gw_+dmft point of view .",
    "an elegant derivation ( see e.g.  ) of the almbladh free energy functional is obtained through a hubbard stratonovich decoupling of the interaction term by a bosonic field @xmath28 , the introduction of lagrange multipliers @xmath29 and @xmath12 imposing @xmath30 and @xmath31 to equal externally chosen fermionic and bosonic propagators @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and finally a legendre transformation to obtain a functional of the latter two quantities .",

    "gw_+dmft approach .",
    "the explicit form of the _",
    "gw_+dmft equations follows then directly from the functional relations between the free energy , the green s function , the screened coulomb interaction etc .",
    "taking derivatives of the functional ( [ psi ] ) as in ( [ eq : def_sigma_p ] ) yields the complete self - energy and polarization operators : @xmath47_{ll ' } \\nonumber \\\\ p(\\vq,\\inun)_{\\a\\b } & = & p_{gw}(\\vq,\\inun)_{\\a\\b } \\label{p_a } \\\\ & - & \\sum_\\vq p_{gw}(\\vq,\\inun)_{\\a\\b}+ p_{imp}(\\inun)_{\\a\\b } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , greek letters indicate a two - particle basis , constructed from the localized ( wannier ) basis indexed by @xmath45 .",
    "the _ ad hoc _ combination of the functional @xmath21 constructed as a sum of local and nonlocal parts thus leads to a physically attractive result : the off - site part of the self - energy ( [ sig_a ] ) is taken from the _ gw _ approximation , whereas the on - site part is calculated to all orders from the dynamical impurity model .",
    "this treatment thus goes beyond usual extended dmft , where the lattice self - energy and polarization are just taken to be their impurity counterparts .",
    "the second term in ( [ sig_a ] ) subtracts the on - site component of the _ gw _ self - energy thus avoiding double counting . at self - consistency",
    "this term can be rewritten as : @xmath48 so that it precisely subtracts the contribution of the _ gw _ diagram to the impurity self - energy .",
    "similar considerations apply to the polarization operator .",
    "the general set of _",
    "gw_+dmft equations to be solved self - consistently is summarized in appendix a. in the following , we discuss a variant , which allows for a physically motivated cheaper treatment of ligand and itinerant empty states .      in the original _ gw_+dmft scheme as described in ref .  ,",
    "the @xmath21 functional is decomposed into nonlocal and local parts , which are then approximated by _",
    "gw _ and dmft respectively .",
    "this means that the local physics of all valence orbitals , including rather itinerant @xmath49 or @xmath50 states , would be generated from a self - consistent impurity model .",
    "it stands to reason that the self - consistent dynamical @xmath51 for those orbitals would in fact come out to be rather small , so that the local dynamical contribution to the self - energy is also small and well described by its first order term in @xmath5 . in practice , the self - energy for the itinerant states would thus be well described by a perturbative self - energy , that is by the _",
    "gw _ self - energy for both , local and nonlocal parts .    in view of these considerations",
    ", it seems a waste of computing time to attempt to solve a dynamical impurity models for all valence states , since the same result can be obtained by applying the dmft construction only to a subset of `` correlated '' states , and to treat all others entirely by _ gw_. a scheme along these lines",
    "was proposed and implemented in ref .  .",

    "one may be tempted to redefine the @xmath21 functional as the one of the _ gw _ approximation @xmath54 , corrected for its local part by dmft only within the correlated subspace ( denoted here as @xmath53 ) , as follows : @xmath32 = gwg & - & g^{loc , d } w^{loc , d } g^{loc , d }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\psi_{imp}[g^{loc , d } , w^{loc , d}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , alternatively , by keeping the original decomposition into local and nonlocal parts @xmath32 = \\psi^{nonlocal } + \\psi^{local}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but approximating the local one by a combination of _ gw _ and dmft @xmath55 = g^{loc } w^{loc } g^{loc } & - & g^{loc , d } w^{loc , d } g^{loc , d } \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\psi_{imp}[g^{loc , d } , w^{loc , d}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the superscript @xmath56 denotes the projection on the local component , and @xmath53 the projection onto the correlated subspace .",
    "though appealing at first sight , such combinations can not be justified without further approximations on a functional basis .",
    "this is due to the fact that screening couples the correlated and itinerant subspaces , so that `` downfolding '' of the interactions to obtain an effective bare interaction within the correlated subspace necessarily involves a decoupling approximation . in the functionals above ,",
    "this is born out of the difficulty of defining @xmath57 , as well as of postulating that @xmath58 is a functional of the green s function and screened coulomb interaction of the correlated subspace only .",
    "fortunately , in practice , these conceptual difficulties do not prevent us from identifying a well - defined scheme , that corresponds to a combination of _ gw _ and dmft , where the impurity model is used for the correlated space only .",
    "the application to srvo@xmath0 presented below confirms the accuracy of such a scheme . in the following subsection",
    "we therefore describe the `` orbital - separated scheme '' used in the present work , where only the local part of the self - energy of the correlated  orbitals is calculated from the impurity model and all other local and nonlocal components are approximated by their first order expressions in @xmath5 .      for the reasons discussed above , in the orbital - separated scheme , one deviates from the general prescription eqs .",
    "( [ sig_a]-[p_a ] ) for the self - energy and polarization by replacing their local parts by their counterparts generated from an impurity model within the correlated subspace only .",
    "we outline in the following the iterative loop obtained at the one - shot _ gw _ level but with full self - consistency at the impurity level .",
    "we call the correlated subspace @xmath53-space and its complement the @xmath59-space",
    ". projections onto these spaces are noted by superscripts .",
    "we furthermore assume that we dispose of a wannier basis which blockdiagonalizes the full lda hamiltonian , and that the _ gw _ self - energy is block - diagonal in the same basis . the wannier basis can be thought of as obtained from the construction of maximally localized wannier functions in the @xmath53 and in the @xmath59 space separately .",
    "the assumption of a vanishing _ gw _ self - energy block @xmath60 in this basis is an additional approximation , @xcite which is however very accurate , as we have explicitly verified for our target compound srvo@xmath0 .",
    "we note that the common assumption in _ gw _ calculations of a diagonal self - energy in the kohn - sham basis is in fact a less justified approximation , and even this is not a severe restriction for srvo@xmath0 @xcite .    starting with a guess for the weiss field and the auxiliary hubbard @xmath51 ,",
    "the impurity model is solved , that is the impurity green s function @xmath61 and screened coulomb interaction @xmath62 are obtained .",
    "these are matrices in the orbital space of the correlated states only . in order to obtain the full self - energy and polarization",
    "the combined quantities @xmath63 involve `` upfolding '' to the full hilbert space .",

    "while the 2 g and e@xmath109 bands are well separated at every given k - point , the partial density of states ( dos ) slightly overlap , and the e@xmath109 states display a pronounced peak at 2.3 ev .",
    "finally , peaks stemming from the sr - d states are located at 6.1 ev and 7.1 ev .",

    "the @xmath112 values used in the above cited lda+dmft calculations , on the other hand , varied rather between 4 ev and 5.5 ev .",
    "these values were such as to reproduce the observed mass enhancement , even though the position of the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) was generally at slightly too high binding energies , suggesting that these values of @xmath112 were indeed on the large side .",

    "this leaves the photoemission feature at 2.7 ev unexplained within lda+dmft . * * position of o2p ligand states * + lda+dmft calculations that also include oxygen ligand orbitals , do not in principle account for corrections to the lda for these orbitals .",
    "such corrections have been introduced by hand as an arbitrary shift on the o2p states @xcite .",
    "this means that this position is not known _ ab initio _ from lda+dmft . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that in the related compound srtio@xmath0 , which is isostructural to srvo@xmath0 but of d@xmath116 configuration , the pd - gap of kohn - sham theory within the lda is underestimated by 1.3 ev compared to experiment @xcite . * * position of sr-4d states * + an analogous problem arises when comparing the energetic position of the sr-4d states in bis and in kohn - sham density functional theory , which underestimates their energy by almost 2  ev . by construction ,",
    "combined lda+dmft schemes do not correct for this error . * * relation between laser arpes results and nonlocal effects * + to the best of our knowledge , it remains open at this stage how to reconcile the laser arpes experiments ( and in particular the finding of a dip at the fermi level ) with the high - photon energy pes which display a pronounced peak .",
    "the study of nonlocal many - body effects on a very low - energy scale remains thus a challenging task for the future .",

    "since the publication of ref .",
    "electronic structure calculations for srvo@xmath0 have met renewed interest : besides a study @xcite within the _ gw _ approximation ( including a cumulant correction similar to the above discussed bose factor ansatz ) , several groups have embarked into attempts of setting up simplified schemes mimicking the results of _",

    "we now turn to the description of the results of _ gw_+dmft calculations using the formalism outlined above for our target compound , srvo@xmath0 .",
    "the _ gw_+dmft calculations will be put into perspective by confronting them to pure _ gw _ calculations , as well as to lda+dmft calculations both , with static and dynamical interactions . as a prelude",

    "the physical interpretation of the frequency - dependence of the interactions is transparent , if one recalls that the effective bare interaction within a subspace of the original hilbert space should include screening by the omitted ( e.g.  higher - energy- @xcite or nonlocal-@xcite ) degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the net result of the rearrangement of the high - energy degrees of freedom as response to a perturbation of the system is an effective reduction of the perturbation strength in the low - energy space .",
    "the effective coulomb interaction in a low - energy effective model for a correlated system is therefore in general an order of magnitude smaller than the matrix element of the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "nevertheless , the latter is recovered in the limit of high - frequencies of the perturbation , when screening becomes inefficient .",
    "the crossover  as a function of frequency  from the low - energy screened regime to the high - frequency bare matrix element of @xmath117 takes place at a characteristic screening ( plasma ) frequency where the dielectric function exhibits a pole structure .    for srvo@xmath0 , the ( partially ) screened interaction , corresponding to the dynamical hubbard interaction at vanishing frequency , takes on a value of @xmath114 ev@xcite for the t@xmath2 orbital - subspace spanned by maximally localized wannier functions .",
    "the corresponding hund s rule exchange @xmath86 is 0.6 ev .",

    "the eels data display a well - defined plasmon excitation at about 15 ev .",
    "the experimental spectrum is well - reproduced by the theoretical imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function calculated within the rpa .",
    "the reason that , besides higher energy one - particle derived features , also the collective plasmon satellite of @xmath119 srtio@xmath0 is well described by our calculation for the non - isoelectronic @xmath120 srvo@xmath0 resides in the fact that it is not dominated by d - electron contributions .",
    "this is evident since the fully and partially screened interaction of the @xmath106 orbitals , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , are very similar at these energies .",
    "overall , this validates using the lda electronic structure for the purpose of calculating the effective interaction @xmath10 of srvo@xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : lda ] , is seen : states beyond the t@xmath2s are in excellent agreement with inverse photoemission results .",
    "in particular the hump at around 2 - 5ev is very well captured .",

    "also the position of occupied states , the o2p orbitals in the shown energy range , improve to the extent that the experimental satellite at -1.6ev is no longer obscured by oxygen spectral weight . with respect to the photoemission experiment however , the binding energy of the o2p is still too small by at least an electronvolt . a possible remedy to this issue could be to extend the wannier space to the o2p and vanadium @xmath125 states and include a local hubbard interaction on the latter in the _ gw_+dmft .",
    "this would favour a charge transfer into the o2p orbitals with which the @xmath125 states hybridize most , thus pushing the oxygen states further down . in our _ gw_+dmft calculations here",

    "however , the physics underlying these similar dispersions is very different : indeed within the _ gw _ , almost half of the t@xmath2 spectral weight is transferred to collective excitations at higher energies .",

    ", we note that the separation of the self - energy into a local dynamical and a nonlocal static part can be interpreted as a generalization of the familiar coulomb - hole - screened exchange ( cohsex ) approximation to a full _ gw _ treatment .",
    "indeed , in the cohsex approximation @xcite the _ gw _ self - energy is given by a static self - energy of the following form : @xmath155 where the first term is a screened exchange self - energy built from the static screened coulomb interaction @xmath156 and the second contains the effect of the coulomb hole @xmath157 here , the indices @xmath158 denote kohn - sham states of wave vector @xmath159 , and the sum runs over occupied states only .",

    "the _ local _ part of @xmath160 is  by symmetry  a scalar in the space of t@xmath2-orbitals , and can thus be considered an irrelevant constant in that space . the coulomb hole self - energy , on the other hand , is purely local .",

    "+ ( 2 ) the local contribution contains the coulomb hole effect as well as band renormalizations beyond the cohsex approximation , stemming from the frequency - dependence of the local dynamical self - energy .",
    "therefore , when considering the band structure corresponding to the nonlocal self - energy contribution only , the coulomb hole part as well as the dynamical correlations are taken out since they are purely local , and the remaining correction can thus be interpreted as the screened exchange contribution .",
    "the widening of the band as compared to the kohn - sham band structure is therefore the familiar broadening by exchange interactions ( which , here , are screened , thus leading to substantial but not as large effects as in unscreened hartree fock theory ) .",
    "the screened exchange self - energy correction to the dft exchange correlation potential can be written as : @xmath162 with a potential @xmath163 representing the kohn - sham exchange - correlation contribution .",
    "matrix elements of this quantity in the kohn - sham basis read @xmath164    an intuitive inspection of these matrix elements suggests the resulting correction to be small for occupied @xmath165 states , but to result in an upward shift for unoccupied states . indeed , for unoccupied states , the matrix elements @xmath166 are necessarily between product states that mix occupied @xmath165 and unoccupied states @xmath167 , and thus small compared to @xmath168 .",
    "this results in the familiar effect of a _ gw _ correction to conduction band states in simple semiconductors , leading to a `` scissors '' correction to the too small kohn - sham band gaps .    in the case of the metallic srvo@xmath0 with d@xmath169 filling ,",
    "the band widening by nonlocal contributions is much stronger for the unoccupied part of the spectrum ( which is enhanced by more than 1 ev ) than for the occupied part . as we will see below",

    "having established the importance of nonlocal correlation effects , as well as their static nature at low energies , we want to characterize their extent _ in real space_. indeed there are efforts to extend dmft calculations from the single impurity setup to a cluster of several sites ( or several momenta ) even for _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "for the case of srvo@xmath0 this was first done in ref .   using the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) method , that partitions the brillouin zone into momentum patches ( two patches , in the cited work ) and thus gives momentum resolved information on a coarse grid .    here",
    ", we will rather follow the spirit of cellular dmft , in which real - space clusters are embedded into the solid , thus allowing nonlocal correlations of the range of the cluster size .",
    "the important question now is how big that cluster has to be in order to exhaust the extent of pertinent nonlocal correlations . for this",

    "experimentally , such a feature is not clearly resolved .",
    "we can thus summarise the effect of dynamical interactions within lda+@xmath10+dmft calculations by noting that the only notable modification in the electronic structure is the improved description of the lower hubbard band , compared to experiment , whereas the situation is less clear for the unoccupied part of the spectrum .",

    "a non - selfconsistent calculation combining a local lda+@xmath10+dmft self - energy with a nonlocal-_gw _ self - energy could therefore be expected to underestimate the bandwidth by a factor @xmath191 .",

    "we now come back to the list of physics questions on our target compound , outlined in the introductory section on srvo@xmath0 :    * * reconciliation of results of dmft and cluster model calculations in the unoccupied part of the spectra , and consistency with _ ab initio _ @xmath112 values * + our finding of the ipes peak at 2.7 ev being dominantly of e@xmath1 character , rather than being an upper hubbard band of t@xmath2 character , coincides with the interpretation of cluster model calculations @xcite , thus reconciling dmft with the cluster model literature .",
    "cluster model calculations place an upper hubbard band of t@xmath2 character at about 2 ev , which would be consistent with the static value of @xmath194 ev .",
    "the cluster calculations , however , do not have access to the effects of the enhancement of the bare band dispersion by nonlocal exchange .",
    "our _ gw_+dmft calculations reveal that the latter is in fact the dominant effect , preventing the formation of a clearly separated sharp upper hubbard band . * * the 2.7ev feature in bis spectra * + related to the previous point , the photoemission feature at 2.7 ev is _ not _ an upper hubbard band , but rather dominated by e@xmath1 states",
    ". it would be most interesting to perform orbital - resolved inverse photoemission studies to confirm this orbital assignment .",
    "* * position of o2p ligand states * + the inclusion of the _ gw _ self - energy for the `` uncorrelated '' states , as explained in the section on the orbital - separated _ gw_+dmft scheme , introduces corrections on the o2p ligand states , which are pushed down in energy , improving the agreement with experiment .",
    "we note , however , that the size of the correction is not quite large enough , compared to experiment . to some extent , this could have been expected : indeed , we believe feedback effects of the coulomb interactions on the v - d states ( and their hybridization ) to be important for determining the o2p position . however , such effects would only be included if an update of the _ gw _ part of the calculation were also performed .",
