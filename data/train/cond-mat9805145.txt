    "in the field of attitude research there is a broad and substantial literature available ( see e.g. fishbein & ajzen ( 1975 ) , petty & cacioppo ( 1986 ) for an overview ) . especially , some _ formal _ models have been developed like osgood and tannenbaum s ( 1955 ) _ congruity principle _",
    ", heider s ( 1946 ) _ balance theory _ or festinger s ( 1957 ) _ dissonance theory_. these models deal with the _ stability _ of attitude structures and the probabilities for special types of of attitude changes .",
    "in contrast , this paper shall treat general mathematical models for the change of the _ fraction _ of individuals having a certain attitude @xmath0 .",
    "such models are of great interest for a _ quantitative _ understanding of attitude formation , and , especially , for the _ prognosis _ of trends in the public opinion ( e.g. of tendencies in the behavior of voters or consumers ) .",
    "coleman s ( 1964 ) _ diffusion model _ was one of the first quantitative models of this kind .",
    "it already distinguished two different types of attitude changes : first , changes by direct interactions .",
    "second , externally induced changes .",
    "later , bartholomew ( 1967 ) developed a _",
    "stochastic _ model for the _ spread of rumors_.    the most advanced model has been introduced by weidlich ( weidlich ( 1972 ) , weidlich & haag ( 1983 ) ) , which has been seized by some authors in one or another modification ( e.g. troitzsch ( 1989 ) , schweitzer et .",
    "al . ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "it is based on a _ master equation _ ( a stochastic formulation ) , which assumes attitude changes to occur with a certain _ probability _ per unit time ( sect .",
    "[ master ] ) . whereas weidlich and haag ( 1983 ) assumed attitude changes by _ indirect interactions _",
    "( which could only describe attitude changes via the media or the spirit of age ) ( sect .",
    "[ master ] ) , the author thinks that attitude changes by _ direct interactions _",
    "( due to conversations or discussions ) are of special interest .",
    "therefore , a modified master equation is introduced in section [ pair ] , which allows to examine the effects of _ pair interactions _",
    "( dyadic interactions ) . from this master equation ,",
    "certain _ rate equations _ for the temporal development of the _ attitude distribution _ can be derived ( sect .",
    "[ pair ] ) .",
    "three types of of attitude changes by pair interactions can be found ( sect .",
    "[ pair ] ) : first , an _ avoidance behavior _ , causing an individual to change the attitude if meeting another individual with the same attitude ( defiant behavior , snob effect ) .",
    "second , a readiness for _ compromises_. third , the tendency to take over the opinion of another individual by _ persuasion_. all three types of attitude changes may , in the course of time , lead to stable equilibrium fractions of the attitudes , which depend on the _ preferences _ for them .",
    "however , there may also appear more complex attitude changes which could not be predicted solely by _ qualitative _ analyses , for example , _ oscillatory _ or _ chaotic _ attitude changes .    in section [ comp ] ,",
    "possible solutions of the model are examined by considering representative cases . by distinguishing several _ subpopulations _",
    "( e.g. blue and white collars ) , different types of behavior are taken into account . the mutual influence of the subpopulations is assumed to depend on their mutual sympathy .",
    "in the following we shall shortly discuss the modell of weidlich and haag . for a more detailled description see weidlich ( 1972 ) and weidlich & haag ( 1983 ) .",
    "suppose we have a system consisting of @xmath1 individuals .",
    "these individuals can normally be divided into @xmath2 _ subpopulations _",
    "@xmath3 consisting of @xmath4 individuals , i.e. @xmath5 by subpopulations @xmath3 , different social groups ( e.g. blue and white collars ) or different characteristic _ types _ @xmath3 of behavior are distinguished with respect to the situation of interest ( e.g. the voting behavior ) .",
    "the @xmath4 individuals of each subpopulation @xmath3 are distributed over several _ states _",
    "@xmath6 being in state @xmath7 means being at place @xmath8 and having the attitude @xmath0 concerning the question of interest ( e.g. `` which political party @xmath0 would you vote for , if there were elections today ? '' ) . if the _ occupation number _",
    "@xmath9 denotes the number of individuals of type @xmath3 being in state @xmath10 , we have the relation @xmath11 let @xmath12 be the vector consisting of all occupation numbers @xmath9 .",
    "this vector is called the _ socio - configuration _ , since it contains all information about the distribution of the @xmath1 individuals over the states @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 shall denote the _ probability _ to find the socio - configuration @xmath15 at time @xmath16 .",
    "this implies @xmath17 if transitions from socio - configuration @xmath15 to @xmath18 occur with a probability of @xmath19 during a short time interval @xmath20 , we have a _ ( relative ) transition rate _ of @xmath21 the _ absolute _ transition rate of changes from @xmath15 to @xmath18 is the product @xmath22 of the probability @xmath14 to have the configuration @xmath15 and the _ relative _ transition rate @xmath23 if having the configuration @xmath15 .",
    "whereas the _ inflow _ into @xmath15 is given as the sum over all absolute transition rates of changes from an _ arbitrary _ configuration @xmath18 to @xmath15 , the _ outflow _ from @xmath15 is given as the sum over all absolute transition rates of changes from @xmath15 to _ another _ configuration @xmath18 . since the temporal change of the probability @xmath14 is determined by the inflow into @xmath15 reduced by the outflow from @xmath15 , we find the _ master equation _ @xmath24 ( haken ( 1983 ) ) .",
    "weidlich and haag ( 1983 ) have assumed the individuals to change from state @xmath10 to state @xmath25 with a transition rate of @xmath26 _ independently _ of each other .",
    "such changes correspond to transitions of the socio - configuration from @xmath15 to @xmath27 with a transition rate of @xmath28 , which is proportional to the number @xmath9 of individuals who can leave the state @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath23 we therefore have the relation @xmath29 assumption ( [ w ] ) has sometimes been doubted to be suitable for describing social processes , since it handles the interactions of individuals in an _ indirect _ way via the dependence on the occupation numbers @xmath9 .",
    "that means , the individual interactions are mediated by the _",
    "mean field _ of the socio - configuration , which could model attitude changes via the media or the spirit of the age .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the @xmath30 indirect interactions of @xmath1 individuals .",
    "in contrast , this article will deal with _",
    "direct _ interactions of individuals , which are a realistic model for attitude changes in conversations or discussions .",
    "we shall consider _ pair interactions _ only , because they are the most important ones .",
    "however , it is also possible to develop models for simultaneous interactions of an arbitrary number of individuals ( helbing ( 1991a ) ) .",
    "figure 2 depicts the @xmath31 direct pair interactions of @xmath1 individuals .",
    "a model describing direct pair interactions is given by the master equation ( [ master ] ) , when taking the special transition rates @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 is the ( relative ) transition rate for two individuals of types @xmath3 and @xmath35 to change their states from @xmath10 and @xmath36 to @xmath25 and @xmath37 due to direct interactions .",
    "the corresponding transition rate @xmath38 for changes of the configuration from @xmath15 to @xmath39 is again proportional to the numbers @xmath9 and @xmath40 of individuals which can leave the states @xmath10 and @xmath36 .",
    "usually , one is mostly interested in the expected _ fractions _",
    "@xmath41 of individuals of type @xmath3 who are in state @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath42 denotes the mean value @xmath43 of the occupation number @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath44 we have the relations @xmath45 @xmath44 can be interpreted as the probability distribution of state @xmath10 within subpopulation @xmath3 . since @xmath46 is the fraction of individuals of type @xmath3 , the probability distribution @xmath47 of state @xmath10 in the _ entire _ population is given by @xmath48 the temporal development of @xmath44 obeys the boltzmann equation ( boltzmann ( 1964 ) ) +    with @xmath49 as long as the absolute values of the ( co)variances @xmath50 are small compared to @xmath51 , and if @xmath52 ( see helbing ( 1991a ) ) .",
    "these conditions are usually fulfilled in case of a great population size @xmath1 .",
    "equation ( ) can be also understood as _ exact _",
    "equation for the _ most probable _ individual behavior .",
    "the interpretation of ( ) is similar to the one of the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "again , the temporal change of the fraction @xmath44 of individuals being in state @xmath10 is given by the inflow ( a ) into state @xmath10 reduced by the outflow ( b ) from state @xmath10 : @xmath53 the inflow [ resp .",
    "outflow ] is given by all transitions , where individuals of type @xmath3 change their states from arbitrary states @xmath25 to state @xmath10 [ resp . from state @xmath10 to arbitrary states @xmath25 ] due to pair interactions with other individuals of arbitrary type @xmath35 , who change their arbitrary states @xmath36 to arbitrary states @xmath37 .",
    "these pair interactions occur with a frequency proportional to the fractions @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the states which are subject to a change .",
    "since @xmath35 , @xmath25 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are arbitrary , one has to carry out a summation over them .    in the following",
    "we shall consider the cases of _ spatially homogeneous _ or _ local _ attitude formation , which are independent of @xmath8 .",

    "for the description or prediction of concrete situations the rates @xmath62 have to be determined empirically ( see helbing ( 1991b ) ) . in the following",
    ", we shall instead examine the possible solutions of ( [ mein ] ) by considering representative examples .",
    "only three kinds of interaction contribute to the temporal change of @xmath63 : +    the interpretation is obviously the following :    1 .",
    "the first term describes some kind of _ avoidance behavior , _ causing an individual to change the opinion from @xmath0 to @xmath60 with a certain probability , when meeting another individual originally having the same opinion @xmath0 .",
    "such defiant behavior is e.g. known as snob effect .",
    "2 .   the second term represents the readiness to change the opinion from @xmath0 to @xmath64 ( in the following called a _ compromise _ ) , if meeting another individual having a different opinion @xmath65 .",
    "this behavior will be found , if attitude @xmath0 can not be maintained when confronted with attitude @xmath61 , but attitude @xmath61 is not satisfying ( for this person ) either .",
    "3 .   the third term describes the tendency to take over the opinion @xmath61 of another individual by _ persuasion . _",
    "according to this classification , the transition rates @xmath66 can be splitted into three contributions : +    where @xmath67 is the kronecker function and @xmath68 equation ( [ mein ] ) has now the form +    @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) are the contributions to the transition rates @xmath62 by interactions of type  @xmath71 .",
    "in order to obtain concrete results , we have to make some plausible specifications of the model .",
    "let @xmath72 be the degree of _ sympathy _ which individuals of type @xmath3 feel towards individuals of type @xmath35 .",
    "then one expects the following : whereas the rate @xmath73 of the readiness for compromises and the rate @xmath74 of the tendency to take over another opinion will be increasing with @xmath72 , the rate @xmath75 of the avoidance behavior will be decreasing with @xmath72 .",
