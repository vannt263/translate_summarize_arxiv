    "recently , the relation between the laws of thermodynamics and that of gravity has aroused great interest . in hawking s work @xcite , it shows that black holes have thermal radiation with a temperature determined by its surface gravity due to the quantum effect , which implies that these two branches of physics may have underly relations , namely , they are unified . the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a unified first law of black hole dynamics and relativistic thermodynamics in spherically symmetric general relativity , see also @xcite . by using the unified law in the framework of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ,",
    "the authors in @xcite find the relation between the friedmann equation and the first law of thermodynamics on the `` inner '' trapping horizon .",
    "they also find that the clausius relation holds for the gauss - bonnet and lovelock theory by treating the higher derivative terms as an effective energy - momentum tensor , but the clausius relation never holds for the scalar - tensor theory , which implies that this is a system with non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "these results indicate that the gravity may be not one of the fundamental forces and it is only another view of thermodynamics . in this spirit",
    ", we can regard the thermodynamics law as the fundamental law and it will give the corresponding gravity theory .",
    "thus , one can study the thermodynamics of some cosmological models to pursue their origins . for related discussions ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "up to now , there are many kinds of dark energy models and modified gravity theories proposed to explain the current accelerating expansion of the universe , which has been confirmed by the observations like type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , cmb and sdss et al . the dark energy models assume the existence of an energy component with negative pressure in the universe , and it dominates and accelerates the universe at late times .",
    "the cosmological constant seems the best candidate of dark energy , but it suffers the fine tuning problem and coincidence problem , and it may even have the age problem @xcite . to alleviate these problems , many dynamic dark energy models were proposed .",
    "however , people still do not know what is dark energy .    since the einstein general gravity theory has not been checked in a very large scale",
    ", then one does not know whether this gravity theory is suitable or not for studying the observational data like sne ia , and maybe the accelerating expansion of universe is due to the gravity theory that differs from the general gravity .",
    "thus , many modified gravity theories like @xmath0 , dgp et al . are proposed to explain the accelerating phenomenology .",
    "the cardassian model is a kind of model in which the friedmann equation is modified by the introduction of an additional nonlinear term of energy density and in this model one does not need dark energy component also .",
    "however , one can not directly find its origin from the first principle .    as we mentioned before",
    ", the gravity may be not a fundamental theory , and one can at least study the thermodynamics of a cosmological model to pursue its origin .",
    "so , in this paper , we will study the thermodynamics of the cardassian universe , and regarded it as its origin .",
    "we find that the corresponding entropy obeys ordinary area law @xmath1 on the trapping horizon when @xmath2 is small , where @xmath2 is the the area of the trapping horizon , and it becomes a constant when @xmath2 is going to be large in the original ( oc ) @xcite and modified polytropic cardassian model ( mpc ) @xcite , while it has a maximum value in the exponential model ( ec ) @xcite .",
    "it seems that the cardassian universe only contains finite information according to the holographic principle , which states that all the information in the bulk should be encoded in the boundary of the bulk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : firstlaw ] , we will give a briefly review on the unified first law and its application . in section [ sec : car ] , we will study the thermodynamics of the cardassian universe including the oc , mpc and ec models , for recent works on the cardassian universe , see @xcite . in the last section , we will give some discussions and conclusions .",
    "einstein equations can be written in a form called `` unified first law '' based on the general definition of black hole dynamics on trapping horizon , which was proposed by hayward @xcite and developed by cai et al @xcite . in the rest of this section",
    ", we will give a brief review on this unified first law in the @xmath3-dimensional spherical symmetric spacetime , in which the metric could be locally written in the double - null form as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the line element of the @xmath6-sphere with unit radius , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions of ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "so , each symmetric sphere has two preferred normal directions , namely the null directions @xmath10 , which will be assumed future - pointing in the following . and also",
    ", we will assume the spacetime is time - orientable .",
    "the expansions of the radial null geodesic congruence are defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the coordinates derivative along @xmath13 .",
    "the expansion measures whether the light rays normal to the sphere are diverging @xmath14 or converging @xmath15 , namely , whether the sphere is increasing or decreasing in the null directions . note that , although the value of @xmath16 will change with geometries , its sign will not , and the only invariants of the metric and its first derivative are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath17 , or equivalently @xmath18 , which has an important physical and geometrical meaning : a sphere is said to be trapped ( untrapped ) if @xmath19 , and if @xmath20 , it is a marginal sphere .",
    "considering non - stationary black holes , hayward has proposed that the future outer trapping horizons defined as the the closure of a hypersurface foliated by future or past , outer or innner marginal sphere is taken as the definition of black holes , since the horizon possess various properties which are often intuitively ascribed to black hole including confinement of observers and analogues of the zeroth , first and second law of thermodynamics . however , in the case of frw universe , one should take the future inner trapping horizon defined by @xmath21 as a system on which the thermodynamics will be established , since the surface gravity is negative on the cosmological horizon .    in a spherical symmetric spacetime",
    ", one can obtain the total energy inside the sphere with radius @xmath7 by calculating the minsner - sharp energy given by @xmath22 which is a pure geometric quantity and has much better properties than the other definitions of energy when one consider the case of non - stationary spacetime .",
    "the relation between the minsner - sharp energy and others could be found in ref .",
    "there are also two invariants constructed from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath23 : @xmath24 which are called the work density , and @xmath25 called the energy flux vector ( also called the energy - supply vector ) , whose components are @xmath26 here and in the following , @xmath27 denotes the two dimension space normal to the sphere . with the help of the definition of minsner - sharp energy and the above two quantities",
    ", one can write the @xmath28 component of einstein equations as a `` unified first law '' : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this unified law contains rich information , e.g. by projecting the unified first law along the trapping horizon , we can obtains the first law of black hole thermodynamics , which has the form @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 is the surface gravity of the trapping horizion . here",
    "@xmath35 is a vector tangent to the trapping horizon , and it should be noticed that by definition of the horizon @xmath36 , one has @xmath37 on the trapping horizon , then @xmath38 also note that by taking the einstein equations @xmath39 , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the definition of the surface gravity in eq .",
    "( [ surg ] ) , one can easily finds @xmath40 which is the clausius relation in the version of black hole thermodynamics , see the first term on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ uflofbh ] ) .",
    "the left side of the above equation is nothing but the heat flow @xmath41 , and the right side has the form @xmath42 , if one identities the temperature @xmath43 and the entropy @xmath44 .",
    "so , in einstein theory , the `` unified first law '' also implies the clausius relation , and this relation is also hold in the gauss - bonet and lovelock gravity theories by treating the higher derivative terms as an effective energy - momentum tensor .",
    "but , in the scalar - tensor theory , this relation is no longer hold due to some non - equilibrium thermodynamical properties . in the next section",
    ", we will study the thermodynamics of the cardassian universe , and calculate the corresponding entropy .",
    "the spacetime of the cardassian universe is described by the frw metric , which could be written in the form of @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which is the radius of the sphere while @xmath49 is the scale factor . defining @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the spacial curvature ,",
    "the metric could be rewritten as a double - null form @xmath52 then we get the trapping horizon @xmath53 by solving the equation @xmath54 as @xmath55 which has the same form of the apparent horizon .",
    "thus , one can get the surface gravity @xmath56 , where we have defined @xmath57 one can also check that @xmath58 indicating the trapping horizon is future . by using eq .",
    "( [ zpmpre ] ) and after a direct calculation , one can get @xmath59 when @xmath60 is chosen .",
    "then , in the @xmath61 coordinates , the project vector is given by @xmath62 .",
    "in the cardassian universe , the friedmann equation is modified as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is some function of the energy density of matter and we have defined the effect energy density @xmath65 . using the continuity equations ,",
    "we can obtain the effective pressure corresponds to the effective energy density @xmath66 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "then , we get the associated work density @xmath68 and energy - supply vector @xmath69 as @xmath70 \\ , , \\\\",
    "\\psi_{e } & = & \\frac{1}{2 } ( g'-1)(\\rho_{m}+p_{m})(-h\\tilde r_{t } dt + a dr ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we obtain @xmath71 where we have used the relation @xmath72 here , we have also identified @xmath73 . and ,",
    "for the heat flow of pure matter , we also have @xmath74 so , when @xmath75 , the above equation reduces to the clausius relation in the unmodified friedmann model . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on some concrete cardassian models , namely , the original cardassian model ( oc ) , the modified polytropic cardassian model ( mpc ) and the exponential model ( ec ) . in these models ,",
    "the function @xmath76 takes different forms , which will reduce to @xmath67 in the early universe and differ from the unmodified friedmann universe at redshift @xmath77 , during which it will gives rise to accelerated expansion .      in this model ,",
    "the function @xmath76 is given by @xmath78 = \\rho_{m}\\big[1+f_{o}(\\rho_{m})\\big]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is a character energy density in the cardassian universe and the parameter @xmath80 is assumed to satisfy @xmath81 to give rise to a acceleration of the universe .",
