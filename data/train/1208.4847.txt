    "understanding the structure of infrared ( ir ) singularities of gauge - theory scattering amplitudes is an important problem . on one hand",
    ", it helps in unveiling the deeper structure of quantum field theory in higher orders of perturbation theory ; on the other , it also has practical applications .",
    "the ability to predict the ir singularities of @xmath0-parton amplitudes enables one to systematically resum large logarithmic corrections to cross sections and differential distributions for many important collider processes .",
    "this leads to a higher precision in the calculation of these observables .",
    "the problem of predicting the structure of ir singularities of on - shell @xmath0-particle scattering amplitudes in massless qcd simplifies , if one realizes that they can be put in one - to - one correspondence with ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of operators defined in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "this idea implies that ir divergences can be studied by means of standard renormalization - group techniques  a concept that had been developed earlier in the context of theories of wilson lines @xcite .",
    "the ir divergences of @xmath0-point scattering amplitudes can be absorbed into a multiplicative renormalization factor @xmath3 , which can be derived from an anomalous dimension @xmath4 .",
    "both objects are matrices in color space , i.e.  they mix amplitudes with the same particle content but different color structures .",
    "the predictive power of this approach relies on the fact that the anomalous dimension @xmath4 is tightly constrained by the structure of the effective field theory @xcite : soft - collinear factorization implies that @xmath4 splits into a collinear and a soft contribution , @xmath5 , and given that there are no interactions among different collinear sectors of scet , all non - trivial color and momentum dependence is encoded in the soft anomalous dimension @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the anomalous dimension associated with an operator built out of @xmath0 wilson lines , one for each external parton , directed along the momentum of that parton and living in the appropriate representation of @xmath7 .",
    "we use the color - space formalism , in which amplitudes are treated as @xmath0-dimensional vectors in color space @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 is the color generator associated with the @xmath9-th parton in the scattering amplitude , which acts as an @xmath7 matrix on the color indices of that parton .",
    "explicitly , one has @xmath10 for a final - state quark or initial - state anti - quark , @xmath11 for a final - state anti - quark or initial - state quark , and @xmath12 for a gluon .",
    "the dependence of the soft anomalous dimension on the external momenta @xmath13 of the partons is encoded via so - called cusp angles @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , which for slightly off - shell , massless partons are defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the sign factor @xmath18 if the momenta @xmath13 and @xmath19 are both incoming or outgoing , and @xmath20 otherwise .",

    "@xcite @xmath22\\ ] ] contains the sum of the collinear contributions , where @xmath23 is the cusp anomalous dimension in the color representation of parton @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the structure of the soft anomalous dimension is constrained in three different ways :    * soft - collinear factorization , the fact that the interactions between soft and collinear particles in the scet lagrangian can be removed by a field redefinition @xcite , implies a set of partial differential equations @xcite , which can be written in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the set of cusp angles .",
    "these equations allow two types of dependences on the cusp angles : either a linear dependence on @xmath14 , or an arbitrary dependence on the conformal cross ratios @xmath26 the latter possibility is allowed because the differential operator in ( [ eq9 ] ) gives zero when acting on a conformal cross ratio , so any function of conformal cross ratios is a solution to the homogeneous equation associated with ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "* the non - abelian exponentiation theorem @xcite implies that only single connected gluon webs , whose ends can be attached in arbitrary ways to the @xmath0 wilson lines , contribute to the soft anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "this imposes tight constraints on the color structures that can arise in higher orders of the loop expansion .",
    "the generalization of the concept of `` webs '' to multi - parton amplitudes has been discussed in detail in @xcite . * in the limit where two or more partons become collinear , an @xmath0-parton scattering amplitude splits into an ( @xmath27)-parton amplitude times a process - independent splitting amplitude , which involves the collinear partons only @xcite .",
    "the fact that the anomalous dimension of the splitting amplitude must be independent of the momenta and color generators of the partons not involved in the splitting process imposes a non - trivial constraint on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "up to three - loop order , the most general form of the soft anomalous dimension compatible with these constraints reads @xcite @xmath28 where we use the short - hand notations @xmath29 ( summed over @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 . , where @xmath32 is the set of permutation of @xmath0 objects . ] under index permutations",

    "it is expected on general grounds that casimir scaling is not an exact property of the cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "indeed , using arguments based on the ads / cft correspondence , results for the cusp anomalous dimension obtained in the strong - coupling limit were found to be inconsistent with relation ( [ casimir ] ) @xcite . in perturbation theory , casimir scaling",
    "could first be violated at four - loop order .",
    "we will come back to this question below .",
    "the function @xmath45 in the last term in ( [ eq8 ] ) has a perturbative series starting at three - loop order ( or later ) .",
    "its dependence on @xmath38 is suppressed in our notation for simplicity .",
    "we finally also quote the result for the full anomalous dimension @xmath5 , which is obtained from ( [ eq8 ] ) by adding the collinear contribution ( [ gammac ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath46 which very closely resembles the expression for the soft anomalous dimension . here",
    "the right - hand side now only depends on the kinematic invariants @xmath1 . in appendix  [ ap.1 ]",
    "we show explicitly how this anomalous dimension determines the ir poles of @xmath0-parton scattering amplitudes up to four - loop order .",
    "the terms shown in the first line of ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq8a ] ) involve only pairwise correlations among the color charges and momenta of the different partons .",
    "these are the familiar color - dipole correlations arising already at one - loop order from a single gluon exchange .",
    "these terms provide a solution to the inhomogeneous partial differential equations ( [ eq9 ] ) , if one assumes that the casimir - scaling relation ( [ casimir ] ) holds to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the _ dipole conjecture _",
    "@xcite states that this is indeed the case , and that to all orders the anomalous dimension might indeed be given by just the two terms shown in the first line of ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq8a ] ) .",
    "if this conjecture holds true , then this would indicate a semi - classical origin of ir singularities .",
    "starting at three - loop order , however , the four - parton correlation term given in the second line of ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq8a ] ) is allowed by the constraints summarized above , provided that the function @xmath48 vanishes in all collinear limits @xcite .",
    "note that given four different parton indices @xmath49 , there are only two linearly independent conformal cross ratios , since @xmath50 and all other cross ratios are related to the ones above by means of the symmetry relations @xmath51 .",
    "following @xcite , we choose the arguments of the function @xmath48 such that they match the symmetry properties of the color structure @xmath33 .",
    "it then follows that the function @xmath45 must be odd in its first argument .",
    "it has recently been shown that the high - energy ( `` regge '' ) limit imposes an interesting additional constraint on @xmath0-parton scattering amplitudes , which has important implications for the functional dependence of the anomalous dimension @xmath4 on the conformal cross ratios @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the point is that the leading ir singularities of the regge slopes are correctly described by the dipole conjecture , so extra contributions from functions such as @xmath48 in ( [ eq8a ] ) must only give rise to subleading logarithms .",
    "interestingly , this condition is not fulfilled for any of the candidate functions for @xmath48 proposed in the literature @xcite . on the other hand , it has not been demonstrated that the regge constraint is strong enough to exclude the existence of non - zero functions of conformal cross ratios .",
    "the goal of this paper is to push the analysis of the anomalous dimension further by addressing a couple of open issues . in section  [ a.2 ] , we answer the question whether the regge constraint excludes the existence of multi - parton correlations in the anomalous dimension by constructing explicit examples for the function @xmath48 in ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq8a ] ) , which vanish in all collinear limits and in addition do not give rise to leading logarithms in the high - energy limit .",
    "this proves that such functions can exist , and that therefore the regge constraint does not help to simplify the structure of the anomalous dimension beyond the constraints imposed by soft - collinear factorization , non - abelian exponentiation , and collinear limits . in section  [ a.3 ]",
    ", we extend the analysis of the anomalous dimension @xmath4 presented in @xcite to the level of four loops , thereby gaining further insights into the structure of the result in higher orders . at @xmath52 new webs involving four and five",
    "gluons appear and give rise to interesting new color structures .",
    "we confirm the finding of @xcite , that even at four - loop order the contributions to the soft anomalous dimension @xmath6 that are linear in the cusp angles still have the structure shown in the first line in ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we find four new functions of conformal cross ratios , accompanied by color structures correlating four or five external partons . as a by - product of our analysis",
    ", we extend the analysis of two - parton collinear limits performed in @xcite to the more general case where three or more parton momenta become collinear . as discussed in appendix  [ ap.2 ] , these multi - parton collinear limits do not provide additional constraints at three - loop order , but they may yield useful information on one of the new functions of conformal ratios associated with five - gluon webs , which appear first at the level of four loops .",

    "the terms shown in the first line of ( [ eq8a ] )  correctly reproduces the known behavior of the regge trajectories of gluons and quarks at leading logarithmic order , and in fact it extends it to particles transforming under an arbitrary representation of the gauge group .",

    "likewise , we conclude that the terms in the last two lines , which multiply independent color structures times loop functions that arise first at three - loop order , must not contain terms proportional to @xmath75 or higher in the limit @xmath76 . terms of @xmath77 are allowed , since they break reggeization only in the imaginary part of the amplitude , as are generic terms of @xmath78 .",

    "it is , however , not too difficult to construct functions similar to those proposed in @xcite , which vanish in the two - particle collinear limit and contain only subleading logarithms in the regge limit .",

    "hence , any function @xmath104 provides a viable model for the four - parton correlation term in ( [ eq8a ] ) .",

    "the fate of the dipole conjecture depends on the result of such a calculation .",

    "it is therefore sufficient to consider symmetrized products of color generators only .",
    "the four - gluon webs in figure  [ 4loop ] ( b ) instead are proportional to the traces @xmath109\\ ] ] of symmetrized products of generators in the representation @xmath110 .",
    "contracting them with the color generators of the external partons gives rise to higher casimir invariants .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it is sufficient to consider traces of generators in the fundamental representation , since @xmath111 with a representation - dependent index @xmath112 . the coefficient functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 in relation ( [ 54 ] ) below contain two terms of the form @xmath115 , and similarly for @xmath114 .",
    "it follows that we need to consider the two color structures @xmath116 which we will analyze separately in the next two sections .    in our discussion in this section",
    "we will _ not _ make use of the constraint derived by considering two - particle collinear limits , since the validity of collinear factorization has not yet been proved to all orders in perturbation theory .",

    "the additional simplifications implied when one considers two - particle collinear limits will be discussed in section  [ sec:2p_collinear ] .",

    "the validity of collinear factorization has recently been scrutinized @xcite . our analysis in this section relies on the assumption that this property is true to sufficiently high orders in perturbation theory , and this then implies relation ( [ gamsp ] ) , which imposes an important constraint on the structure of the anomalous dimension in higher orders .",
    "an all - order proof of collinear factorization for leading - color amplitudes has been given in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have argued that one should distinguish between a time - like collinear limit , in which the two collinear partons are both either in the initial or the final state , and a space - like collinear limit , in which one particle is in the initial state and the other one in the final state .",
    "they have considered the known dipole structure of ir divergences and derived the corresponding structure of the anomalous dimensions of the splitting amplitudes .",

    "briefly , factorization in the time - like collinear limit is guaranteed by color coherence .",
    "the latter is at work in the space - like collinear limit as well , but there factorization is broken by the non - commutativity of coulomb / glauber gluon exchanges with other soft exchanges .    for our purposes , however , it is sufficient to only consider time - like collinear limits",
    ". then there is no problem with the constraint ( [ gamsp ] ) , and it can be used to derive the desired conditions on the anomalous dimension . note that even though @xmath4 controls the ir divergences of scattering amplitudes , at the same time it controls the uv divergences of @xmath0-jet operators in scet .",
    "uv singularities are independent of external states and do not care whether we consider matrix elements with particles in the initial or final state .",
    "it is interesting to explore how the new structures arising at four - loop order and compiled in ( [ dg4fin ] ) behave in the large-@xmath171 limit of @xmath7 gauge theory . since several results at three- and four - loop order",

    "we will now show that the same is true for the new structures arising at four - loop order .    in order to illustrate this fact , we follow @xcite and consider the effect of the color structures in ( [ dg4fin ] ) acting on color traces of the type @xmath197 , which represent a basis of leading color structures of @xmath0-particle gluonic amplitudes . in this way",

    "similarly , the three - loop structure @xmath33 in ( [ eq8a ] ) is of @xmath201 @xcite , which is @xmath200-suppressed relative to the leading structure at three - loop order .",
    "ir divergences of massless gauge - theory scattering amplitudes can be removed by means of a multiplicative renormalization factor @xmath3 , which in turn is determined by the anomalous dimension @xmath4 of @xmath0-jet operators in scet .",
    "the structure of this anomalous dimension is strongly constrained by color conservation , soft - collinear factorization , non - abelian exponentiation , two - particle ( and multi - particle ) collinear limits , and the high - energy regge limit .",
    "when these constraints are taken into account , it is found that up to three - loop order the anomalous dimension takes the simple form ( [ eq8a ] ) .",
    "the terms in the first line of this equation , which start at one - loop order , describe pairwise color - dipole correlations among the different particles .",
    "the dipole conjecture states that these terms are all there is to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite . at @xmath202 ,",
    "the only possible exception is an additional structure inducing correlations among four external particles , shown in the second line of ( [ eq8a ] ) .",
    "so far , no example of a function @xmath45 of conformal cross ratios consistent with the constraints from collinear limits and the high - energy regge limit had been constructed in the literature , and it had been speculated whether these constraints combined might even exclude the existence of such a function  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated in section  [ a.2 ] that this hope was too optimistic .",
    "we have constructed a class of rather simple functions with maximum transcendentality , which satisfy all constraints .",
    "this is an existence proof that non - trivial functions of conformal cross ratio , arising at the level of three loops and higher , are possible and not excluded by any known constraints .",
    "indeed , our analysis shows that while the regge limit constrains the functional form of these functions , it does not imply any new structural constraints on the anomalous dimension beyond those derived from soft - collinear factorization , non - abelian exponentiation , and collinear limits . in section  [ a.3 ]",
    "we have extended the analysis of the anomalous dimension to four - loop order , finding further modifications of the dipole formula that once again are governed by functions of conformal cross ratios .",
    "the most general structure is shown in ( [ dg4fin ] ) .",
    "it involves three new types of four - particle correlations and a single type of five - particle correlation . while the functional dependence of these structures can be constrained by considering two - particle ( and multi - particle ) collinear limits and the high - energy behavior , their presence can not be excluded , and following the lines of section  [ a.2 ] it would not be difficult to construct examples of functions consistent with all constraints .    in light of these findings , it is not unlikely that the dipole conjecture must be revised and that all or some of the additional structures will indeed turn out to be non - zero",
    ". based on the observations made in the previous sections , we are led to propose a weaker form of the conjecture , which states that violations of the dipole formula , if they exist , share three properties :    * they involve correlations of at least four partons ; * they are given in terms of functions of conformal cross ratios , which vanish in all relevant collinear limits and are free of leading logarithms in the regge limit ; * at each order in @xmath38 , they are suppressed relative to the contributions contained in the dipole formula by at least a factor of @xmath200 .",
    "the last statement implies that the dipole formula is exact ( in perturbation theory ) in the planar limit for @xmath7 gauge theory .",
    "the first statement implies that the dipole formula holds to all orders in perturbation theory for the case of scattering amplitudes involving two or three partons .",
    "it then follows that the cusp anomalous dimension obeys casimir scaling : @xmath203 while this relation is known to be true to @xmath202 by direct calculation @xcite , it is not expected to hold non - perturbatively @xcite . the weak dipole conjecture could be violated if some of our basic assumptions , such as the validity of collinear factorization , were to fail starting at some order in perturbation theory . in ( [ dg4 ] ) and ( [ casimir4 ] ) we have presented expressions for the anomalous dimension in general , and the cusp anomalous dimension in particular , which can be derived without making use of the collinear constraint .",

    "<S> the infrared divergences of massless @xmath0-parton scattering amplitudes can be derived from the anomalous dimension of @xmath0-jet operators in soft - collinear effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> up to three - loop order , the latter has been shown to have a very simple structure : it contains pairwise color - dipole interactions among the external partons , governed by the cusp anomalous dimension and a logarithm of the kinematic invariants @xmath1 , plus a possible three - loop correlation involving four particles , which is described by a yet unknown function of conformal cross ratios of kinematic invariants . </S>",
    "<S> this function is constrained by two - particle collinear limits and by the known behavior of amplitudes in the high - energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a class of relatively simple functions satisfying these constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend the analysis to four - loop order , finding that three additional four - particle correlations and a single five - particle correlation appear , which again are governed by functions of conformal cross ratios . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the dipole conjecture , which states that only two - particle color - dipole correlations appear in the anomalous dimension , may need to be generalized . </S>",
    "<S> we present a weaker form of the conjecture , stating that to all orders in perturbation theory corrections to the dipole formula are governed by functions of conformal cross ratios , and are @xmath2 suppressed relative to the dipole term . </S>",
    "<S> if true , this conjecture implies that the cusp anomalous dimension obeys casimir scaling to all orders in perturbation theory .    </S>",
