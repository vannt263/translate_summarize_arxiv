    "in recent years , intensive studies on non - equilibrium phenomena have been undertaken through a variety of stochastic process models of many particle systems @xcite .",
    "typical examples are driven lattice gas systems with a simple but nonlinear interaction among constituent particles .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is one of the simplest driven lattice gas models proposed originally to describe the dynamics of ribosome along rna @xcite . in the asep",
    ", each site is occupied by at most one particle .",
    "each particle is allowed to hop to its nearest neighbor right ( left ) site with the rate @xmath0 @xmath1 if it is empty .",
    "the asep admits exact analyses of non - equilibrium properties by the matrix product ansatz and the bethe ansatz .",
    "the matrix product form of the stationary state was first found in the open boundary case @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained in various driven lattice gas systems in one dimension with both open and periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "applications of the bethe ansatz @xcite to the asep have also been successful .",
    "see for example the works @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the studies of the asep under periodic , infinite and open boundary conditions , respectively . in the periodic boundary case",
    ", the dynamical exponent @xmath2 of the relaxation time to the stationary state is @xmath3 if @xmath4 and @xmath5 if @xmath6 according to the analysis of the bethe equation .",
    "this implies that the asep belongs to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) or edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) universality classes depending on whether the hopping rate is asymmetric or symmetric , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following multi - species generalization of the asep on a ring of length @xmath7 .",
    "a local state on each site of the ring assumes @xmath8 states @xmath9 . a nearest neighbor pair of the states is interchanged with the transition rate @xmath10 we regard the local state @xmath11 as a vacant site and @xmath12 as a site occupied by a particle of the @xmath13th kind .",
    "the dynamics is formulated in terms of the master equation @xmath14 on the probability vector @xmath15 .",
    "we call the model the ( @xmath16)-species asep or simply the multi - species asep .",
    "the usual asep corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 markov matrix @xmath19 will be called the  hamiltonian \" although it is not hermitian for @xmath4 .",
    "( at @xmath6 , it is hermitian and coincides with the @xmath20 invariant heisenberg hamiltonian . ) its eigenvalue with the largest real part is 0 corresponding to the stationary state .",
    "the other eigenvalues contribute to the relaxation behavior through @xmath21 .",
    "especially those with the second largest real part determine the relaxation time @xmath22 and the dynamical exponent @xmath2 by the scaling behavior @xmath23 .",
    "our finding is that @xmath2 remains the same with the usual asep @xmath17 .",
    "the key to the result is that the spectrum of @xmath19 in any multi - species particle sector includes that for an @xmath17 sector .",
    "we systematize such spectral inclusion relations by exploiting the poset structure of particle sectors . as a byproduct we find a duality , a global aspect in the spectrum of the hamiltonian , which is new even at the heisenberg point @xmath6 .",
    "there are some other multi - species models with different hopping rules such as abc model @xcite and ahr model @xcite , etc .",
    "the recent paper @xcite says that the ahr model still has the dynamical exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the multi - species asep in this paper is a most standard generalization of the one - species asep allowing the application of the bethe ansatz .",
    "let us comment on this point and related works to clarify the origin of integrability of the model . in @xcite , a formulation by hecke algebra was given for a wider class of stochastic models including reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "a bethe ansatz treatment was presented in @xcite .",
    "as is well known @xcite , however , there underlies a two dimensional integrable vertex model behind a bethe ansatz solvable hamiltonian . in the present model ,",
    "the relevant vertex model is a special case of the perk - schultz model ( called  second class of models \" in @xcite )",
    ". it should be fair to say that the nested bethe ansatz for the present model is originally due to schultz @xcite .",
    "for an account of the perk - schultz @xmath24-matrix in the framework of multi - parameter quantum group , see @xcite and reference therein .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ a : sec:2 ] , we introduce the multi - species asep hamiltonian together with its basic properties . in section [ sec:3 ] , we explain how the spectral gap responsible for the relaxation time is reduced to the one - species case and determine the dynamical exponent as in .",
    "our argument is based on spectral inclusion property and conjecture [ k : con : sp ] supported by numerical analyses . in section [ sec:4 ] , we elucidate a new duality of the spectrum of the hamiltonian in theorem [ k : th : sd ] .",
    "an intriguing feature is that it emerges only by dealing with all the basic sectors of the @xmath25-state model on the length @xmath7 ring .",
    "( the term  basic sector \" will be defined in section [ a : sec:2 ] . )",
    "the argument of section [ sec:4 ] is independent from the bethe ansatz . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    ", we discuss the bethe ansatz integrability of the multi - species asep and the underlying vertex model including the completeness issue .",
    "we execute the nested algebraic bethe ansatz in an arbitrary nesting order , which leads to an alternative explanation of the spectral inclusion property . except",
    "the arbitrariness of the nesting order , section [ k : sec : tme ] is a review .",
    "appendix [ app : dd ] gives a proof of the dimensional duality ( theorem [ k : th : dd ] ) needed in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "appendix [ sec : stationary ] is a sketch of a derivation of the stationary state by the bethe ansatz .",
    "appendix [ sec : appc ] contains the complete spectra of transfer matrix and hamiltonian in the basic sectors with the corresponding bethe roots for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "they agree with the completeness conjectures in section [ k : subs : cp ] .",
    "consider an @xmath7-site ring @xmath28 where each site @xmath29 , is assigned with a variable ( local state ) @xmath30 .",
    "we introduce a stochastic model on @xmath28 such that nearest neighbor pairs of local states @xmath31 are interchanged with the transition rate : @xmath32 where @xmath0 and @xmath33 are real nonnegative parameters .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics is formulated in terms of the continuous - time master equation on the probability of finding the configuration @xmath34 at time @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a step function defined as @xmath38 ( actually , @xmath39 can be set to any value . )    our model can be regarded as an interacting multi - species particle system on the ring .",
    "we interpret the local state @xmath40 as representing the site @xmath41 occupied by a particle of the @xmath13th kind .",
    "the transition ( [ a : rule ] ) is viewed as a local hopping process of particles .",
    "we identify the first kind particles with vacancies .",
    "note that a particle @xmath13 has been assumed to overtake any @xmath42 with the same rate @xmath0 as the vacancy @xmath43 .",
    "we call this model the multi - species asep or more specifically the @xmath44-species asep .",
    "the usual asep corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "we will be formally concerned with the zero - species asep ( @xmath45 ) as well .",
    "the case @xmath6 will be called the multi - species symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be the basis of the single - site space @xmath47 and represent a particle configuration @xmath34 as the ket vector @xmath48 . in terms of the probability vector @xmath49",
    "the master equation is expressed as @xmath50 where the linear operator @xmath19 has the form @xmath51 here @xmath52 acts on the @xmath41th and the @xmath53th components of the tensor product as @xmath54 and as the identity elsewhere .",
    "@xmath55 denotes the @xmath8 by @xmath8 matrix unit sending @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the equation has the form of the schrdinger equation with imaginary time and thus provides our multi - species asep with a quantum hamiltonian formalism .",
    "of course in the present case , @xmath58 itself gives the probability distribution unlike the squared wave functions in the case of quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless we call the matrix @xmath19 the _ hamiltonian _ in this paper by the abuse of language .",
    "our hamiltonian @xmath19 is an @xmath59 by @xmath59 matrix whose off - diagonal elements are @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and diagonal elements belong to @xmath62 .",
    "each column of @xmath19 sums up to @xmath61 assuring the conservation of the total probability @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath19 is hermitian only at @xmath6 , where it becomes the hamiltonian of the @xmath20-invariant heisenberg spin chain @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the transposition of the local states @xmath71 . in general ,",
    "imaginary eigenvalues of @xmath19 form complex conjugate pairs . in section [ sec:5 ] , bethe ansatz integrability of @xmath19 for general @xmath60 will be demonstrated .",
    "although @xmath19 is not normal in general , we expect that it is diagonalizable based on conjecture [ k : con : dep ] and the remark following it .",
    "this fact will be used only in corollary [ k : cor : ome ] .    in view of the transition rule",
    ", our hamiltonian @xmath19 obviously preserves the number of particles of each kind .",
    "it follows that the space of states @xmath72 splits into a direct sum of sectors and @xmath19 has the block diagonal structure : @xmath73 here the direct sums @xmath74 extend over @xmath75 such that @xmath76 .",
    "the array @xmath77 labels a sector @xmath78 , which is a subspace of @xmath72 specified by the multiplicities of particles of each kind .",
    "namely , the latter sum in is taken over all @xmath79 such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 stands for the ordering non decreasing to the right .",
    "in other words , the @xmath82 in runs over all the permutations of the right hand side of . the array @xmath77 itself will also be called a sector .",
    "a sector , @xmath83 for instance , will also be referred in terms of the sort sequence as @xmath84 . by the definition @xmath85 .",
    "by now we have separated the master equation into the ones in each sector @xmath86 with @xmath87 . since the transition rule only refers to the alternatives @xmath88 or @xmath89 , the master equation in the sector @xmath90 for example is equivalent to that in @xmath91 for any @xmath92 .    henceforth without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath93 and restrict our consideration to the _ basic sectors _ that have the form @xmath94 for some @xmath95 with @xmath96 being all positive .",
    "the basic sectors are labeled with the elements of the set @xmath97 in this convention , which will be employed in the rest of the paper except section [ sec:5 ] , @xmath95 plays the role of @xmath8 in the sense that @xmath98 for @xmath99 is equivalent to the hamiltonian of the @xmath100-species asep .",
    "in section [ sec:3 ] we study specific eigenvalues of @xmath19 that are relevant to the leading behavior of the relaxation . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we elucidate a spectral duality , a new global aspect of the spectrum of @xmath19 , which has escaped a notice in earlier works mostly devoted to the studies of the thermodynamic limit @xmath101 under a fixed @xmath8 .",
    "the initial value problem of the master equation @xmath86 with @xmath87 in the sector @xmath102 is formally solved as latexmath:[\\ ] ] the @xmath736-sum in the last term is @xmath747 due to ( [ k : eq : wa ] ) , finishing the proof .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ k : th : add]_. for @xmath748 , we are to show @xmath749 where the explicit form of the dual is taken from ( [ k : eq : di ] ) .",
    "we invoke the double induction on @xmath750 .",
    "the case @xmath751 is trivially true .",
    "in addition , the case @xmath752 has already been verified for all @xmath7 in lemma [ k : le : mae ] .",
    "we assume that the assertion for @xmath753 is true for @xmath754 with any @xmath755 and also for @xmath756 with @xmath757 .",
    "consider the decomposition ( [ k : eq : dec ] ) . by the induction assumption , the two quantities @xmath758 on the right hand side",
    "can be replaced with their dual .",
    "then the relation to be proved becomes @xmath759 in terms of @xmath760 , this is expressed as @xmath761 the proof is finished by lemma [ k : le : owari ] .",
    "here we sketch a procedure to derive the stationary state in the framework of the algebraic bethe ansatz . throughout this appendix",
    ", we set the nesting order as a standard one : @xmath546 .",
    "as seen in section  [ sec : stationary - eigenvalue ] , the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for the stationary state can be simply calculated by setting all the bethe roots equal to @xmath569 .",
    "in contrast to the eigenvalue problem , the evaluation of the eigenstate is not trivial .",
    "this is caused by the @xmath762-operators such as and that approach zero as @xmath763 .",
    "thus to obtain the state , we must normalize @xmath762-operators as @xmath764 note that @xmath765 .",
    "first we consider the eigenstate @xmath766 of @xmath767 .",
    "as shown in section [ sec:5 - 1 ] , this state is constructed by a multiple action of @xmath768 on @xmath769 : @xmath770 where @xmath771 is the element of @xmath766 , from which the eigenstate @xmath772 of @xmath773 can be constructed as @xmath774 note that @xmath775 denotes @xmath776 defined by .",
    "since the coefficient @xmath771 contains the term @xmath777 , we can not take the limit @xmath778 ( @xmath779 independently of @xmath172 . to take this limit correctly , we solve for the roots @xmath780 ( @xmath781 ) in terms of @xmath782 by using the bethe equations : @xmath783 in the above , we have put @xmath784 . to extract the behavior of @xmath780 around the point @xmath569 ,",
    "we expand them in terms of @xmath785 as @xmath786 where @xmath787 . inserting them into and comparing the coefficients of each order ,",
    "one obtains the set of equations determining the coefficients @xmath788 . in the following , as an example , we write down the equations determining the first three coefficients .",
    "@xmath789 where @xmath790 and @xmath791 are defined as @xmath792 and , for @xmath793 , @xmath794 and , for @xmath795 , @xmath796 by solving these equations , the coefficients @xmath788 are uniquely determined .",
    "for instance , @xmath797 is simply given by roots of unity : @xmath798 substituting together with the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath788 into and then taking the limit @xmath799 , one obtains the eigenstate @xmath772 whose elements give @xmath800 .",
    "repeating this procedure , one calculates the stationary state .    as a simple example , let us demonstrate this procedure for the maximal sector of @xmath801 ( @xmath802 @xmath803 )",
