    "cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are explosions of huge energy @xmath13  ergs ( see piran 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the relativistic ejecta of the explosion produces the observed @xmath0-ray pulse with duration of a few seconds that propagates ahead of the ejecta and interacts with the ambient medium first , before the blast wave driven by the ejecta .",
    "madau & thompson ( 2000 ) and thomson & madau ( 2000 , hereafter tm ) pointed out that the @xmath0-ray pulse can preaccelerate the ambient medium to a high lorentz factor .",
    "even more importantly , the pulse - medium interaction is accompanied by runaway loading of @xmath4 pairs ( tm ) .",
    "the interaction occurs inside the thin radiation front where the primary photons scatter off the medium and turn into @xmath4 via @xmath14 reaction ; the created @xmath4 increase the medium opacity , do more scattering , and next generations of @xmath4 are loaded in a runaway manner .",
    "tm also pointed out that the @xmath4 loading and preacceleration ahead of the blast wave should modify the grb afterglows ( see also recent paper by mszros , ramirez - ruiz , & rees 2001 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we develop an accurate model for the radiation front and assess its impact on the blast wave .",
    "the propagating front is self - similar and its non - linear structure ( the rise of density and velocity across the front ) admits a simple description .",
    "we find the medium parameters behind the front and identify the range of radii where the impact on the medium is strong and hence the ensuing blast wave is strongly affected .",
    "especially interesting effects are found for grbs with massive progenitors , leading to spectacular observational phenomena .",
    "in this paper we assume that the radiation front is formed early inside the ejecta ( the so - called `` internal '' scenario which easily explains the fast variability of grbs , see piran 1999 ) .",
    "the front energy remains constant with radius i.e. we neglect additional radiation from the ensuing blast wave ( afterglow ) compared to the prompt radiation from the ejecta . in a separate paper ( beloborodov a.m. , in preparation )",
    "we study the opposite case where the ejecta emission is negligible and the @xmath0-ray front is created by the blast wave itself ( the `` external ''  scenario ) .    in    2 and 3 a detailed formulation of the problem and basic equations",
    "are given .",
    "numerical solution is presented in   4 . in   5",
    "we develop an analytical model that explains the front structure and reproduces the numerical results with good accuracy .",
    "the backreaction of the grb - medium interaction on the prompt @xmath0-rays is studied in ",
    "the sweeping of the medium by radiation and the front evolution with radius are studied in   7 . in ",
    "8 we compute the blast wave dynamics in the preaccelerated environment and evaluate its emission .",
    "grb produces a thin shell ( `` front '' ) of collimated radiation with bolometric flux @xmath15 and spectrum @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the lagrangian coordinate in the moving shell , @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the front thickness and @xmath21 is the observed duration of the burst .",
    "the front propagates through the ambient medium with velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the medium interaction with the front is convenient to view in the @xmath18-coordinate : medium `` enters '' the @xmath20-shell at @xmath23 , passes through it and goes out at @xmath24 with new density and velocity .",
    "radiation scattered by the medium is decollimated and also streams toward large @xmath18 , being absorbed by the primary beam .",
    "the scattering of grb radiation can have a strong impact on the medium if each electron scatters many photons during its passage through the @xmath20-shell .",
    "the photons `` kicked out '' by the electron from the collimated @xmath0-ray beam can be converted into @xmath4 , so a large number of scatterings would imply a large number of pairs created per one ambient electron . the main contribution to pair production comes from photons with @xmath25 ( see   5 ) , and",
    "their density is @xmath26 .",
    "the electron scatters many photons if its `` free path '' @xmath27 ( the difference @xmath28 between successive scatterings ) is smaller than the front width , measured in cgs units and divided by @xmath29 is denoted as @xmath30 . ]",
    "@xmath31 the radiation flux is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the distance from the center of the explosion and @xmath34 is the isotropic luminosity of the grb .",
    "the total energy of the radiation pulse is @xmath35 and the condition  ( [ eq : lam ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36    beside @xmath37 there is another important length - scale in the front  the typical @xmath28 the scattered photons pass before they get absorbed by the primary radiation .",
    "this `` photon free path '' ( hereafter denoted @xmath38 ) far exceeds @xmath37 .",
    "it implies that pair creation occurs at larger @xmath18 i.e. substantially lags behind scattering . as we show in",
    "  5 , the runway pair loading starts at @xmath39 .",
    "efficient pair loading in the front requires @xmath40 which implies a tighter constraint on radius : @xmath41 . at radii larger than @xmath42",
    "there is neither pair loading nor acceleration of the medium .",
    "@xmath42 should be compared with the deceleration radius of the grb ejecta . the standard @xmath43  cm @xmath44 holds if the ejecta decelerates in a normal interstellar medium ( ism ) . however ,",
    "if the grb has a massive progenitor , its ambient medium is the wind from the progenitor ; then @xmath45 cm depends on the mass loss @xmath46 and the velocity @xmath47 of the wind , e.g. @xmath48 cm for @xmath49 and @xmath50  cm  s@xmath51 expected for a wolf - rayet progenitor ( chevalier & li 1999 ) .",
    "the impact of the radiation front is especially strong in the latter scenario where @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , as shown in   8 , the very value of @xmath53 is changed .",
    "the front model we construct makes use of the fact that the scattering optical depth of the ambient medium @xmath54 is very small .",
    "the grb pulse - medium interaction occurs in a specific regime : each electron of the medium experiences a lot of scattering while grb photons have a low probability of scattering .",
    "( pair loading increases the optical depth ; in the calculations we assume that the medium remains transparent and discuss the conditions under which it becomes opaque in   6.1 . )",
    "another important feature of grbs is that the radiation density strongly dominates over the rest - mass of the ambient medium , @xmath55 .",
    "the primary radiation dominates over the scattered radiation , @xmath4 , and magnetic field in the front .    when the backreaction on the radiation pulse is negligible on time - scales @xmath56 , the propagating front is _ quasi - steady_. it can be formalized as follows .",
    "let us define @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the time passed since the beginning of the explosion .",
    "then we have @xmath59 and @xmath23 at the leading boundary of the front , and @xmath24 at the trailing boundary .",
    "now let us change variables @xmath60 . that the front is quasi - steady",
    "means that the medium parameters are functions of @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a slowly changing parameter .",
    "the front gradually changes when its radius @xmath33 increases .",
    "we aim to construct a model for the front structure , i.e. determine the medium density and velocity as functions of @xmath18 .",
    "we will show that the front evolves in a self - similar manner : with increasing @xmath33 , its structure is given by same unique functions of dimensionless coordinate @xmath63 .",
    "the front is thin ( @xmath64 ) and its quasi - steady structure ( formed on time - scales @xmath65 ) can be described in plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the collimation of grb radiation is very strong , @xmath66 , and to a first approximation it is perfectly collimated .",
    "asymmetry of the explosion does not affect the calculations unless the ejecta are beamed within an angle less than @xmath67 .",
    "possible inhomogeneity of the ambient medium is not considered in this paper [ in contrast , dermer & bttcher ( 2000 ) discussed the impact of the @xmath0-rays on circumstellar clouds ] .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the loaded @xmath4 share immediately their net momentum with the medium .",
    "even though the coulomb collisions are extremely inefficient , there are two other mechanisms of momentum exchange :    \\(1 ) the created @xmath4 form a stream interacting with the medium via beam instability .",
    "the instability time - scale is of order @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the plasma frequency and @xmath70 is the electron density .",
    "\\(2 ) in the presence of transverse magnetic field @xmath71 the pairs gyrate around the field lines frozen into the medium on the larmor time , @xmath72 .",
    "the net momentum of @xmath4 is thus communicated to the medium .",
    "the first mechanism should always work because its time - scale is shorter than the compton cooling time of @xmath4 , @xmath73 , and also much shorter than the time of medium dynamics across the front .",
    "the magnetic coupling may dominate if @xmath74 which requires @xmath75 .",
    "when the medium accelerates one should substitute the rest - frame magnetic field , density , and flux in these estimates .",
    "the acceleration results in compression ( madau & thompson 2000 ) , the density and magnetic field are amplified , and the coupling becomes even stronger .",
    "the coupling passes the net momentum of injected @xmath4 to the medium and maintains their distribution approximately isotropic in the medium rest frame .",
    "it does not ensure however that the @xmath4 also share their energy with other particles .",
    "one can distinguish between two possible situations : ( 1 ) _ partial collectivization _ : @xmath4 injected with a lorentz factor @xmath76 ( measured in the medium rest frame ) quickly get isotropized but preserve @xmath76 ; their subsequent cooling is controlled by compton losses .",
    "this is the case with magnetic coupling .",
    "( 2 )  _ complete collectivization _ :",
    "all particles share their energy instantaneously and maintain a maxwellian distribution in the medium rest frame",
    ". it might be the case if collective modes provide sufficient coupling .",
    "we will show that the majority of @xmath4 are loaded with moderately relativistic energies , cool efficiently ( even with partial collectivization ) , and remain at subrelativistic energies .",
    "particles created at @xmath18 are compton cooled much faster than the medium moves to @xmath77 where next generation of hot pairs is created .",
    "therefore the bulk of pair - creating radiation at @xmath77 has been scattered by cooled particles . to the first approximation",
    ", the medium can be considered as a cold plasma with a bulk velocity @xmath78 found from momentum conservation .",
    "we hereafter use this `` cold '' approximation since it greatly simplifies the calculations ; its validity is checked in ",
    "in this section we give the equations of a steady radiation front in the plane - parallel geometry ( see   2.1 ) .",
    "let @xmath79 be the cosine of the scattering angle .",
    "a primary collimated photon scattered through @xmath79 starts to move backward with respect to the @xmath20-shell with velocity @xmath80 and its @xmath18-coordinate grows .",
    "the scattering at @xmath81 determines the intensity of scattered radiation at @xmath18 , @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the length element along the scattered ray , @xmath84 is compton cross - section ( see appendix ) , @xmath85 is the electron / positron density , and @xmath78 is the medium velocity in units of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath85 , and @xmath78 are taken at the location of scattering , @xmath87 .",
    "the photon energies before and after the scattering , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are related by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the lorentz factor of the scattering medium .",
    "the scattered radiation that propagates from @xmath87 to @xmath18 is attenuated by @xmath14 absorption .",
    "this is accounted for by the exponential factor in equation  ( [ eq : scat ] ) where @xmath92 is the @xmath14 optical depth , @xmath93 the opacity @xmath94 is dominated by the primary collimated radiation ( the scattered radiation has much smaller density , see   2.1 ) .",
    "a scattered photon @xmath95 can interact with primary photons @xmath88 that are above the threshold @xmath96 the cross - section for interaction with @xmath97 is @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath92 can be viewed as the product of @xmath99 and the column density of primary photons above the threshold , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the path passed by the scattered photon .",
    "the exact expression for @xmath102 is given in equation  ( [ eq : opac ] ) of appendix .",
    "in numerical examples we will consider a homogeneous primary radiation pulse i.e. assume that the spectrum @xmath86 does not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "then the @xmath14 opacity is homogeneous across the @xmath20-shell and @xmath103 .",
    "the pair creation rate at given @xmath18 is the rate of @xmath14 interaction between @xmath104 and the primary beam @xmath86 , @xmath105 here we made use of equation  ( [ eq : scat ] ) .",

    "instead , it accumulates at @xmath816 and surfs the radiation pulse . with increasing @xmath33",
    "the front traps new material which is accelerated to a smaller velocity .",
    "this causes the overshooting effect and a caustic appears in the surfing medium (   7.2 ) .",
    "the surfing stage ends at the radius @xmath278 which is equal to or smaller than the radius of the blast wave formation .      1 .   the blast wave forms at @xmath3 .",
    "for short bursts ( @xmath817s ) @xmath818 cm and for longer bursts @xmath819 cm . we limit our consideration here to short bursts .",
    "then the @xmath0-ray front is detached from the blast wave ( by a small distance @xmath820 ) and it leaves behind the changed ambient medium as described in   9.1 ( item 2 ) .",
    "in contrast , radiation of long bursts continuously `` leaks out '' of the ejecta during the blast wave stage which implies additional technicalities deferred to a future work .",
    "if the explosion happens in a constant - density medium with @xmath821  g  @xmath488 then the blast wave decelerates at @xmath822 where the impact of the radiation front is small and the standard afterglow model works well . such conditions probably take place for explosions in ism .",
    "if the explosion happens in a wind from a massive progenitor the radiation front affects strongly the blast wave deceleration .",
    "we defined a parameter @xmath674 ( eq .  [ eq : d_wind ] ) that controls the dynamics ; the blast waves in winds have @xmath675 which corresponds to @xmath794 i.e. the deceleration occurs in a relativistically moving medium .",
    "the standard estimate of @xmath53 is then invalid and instead one should use equation  ( [ eq : dec ] ) .",
    "the ejecta decelerates near the unique radius @xmath823  cm ; it implies that @xmath53 weakly depends on the medium parameters as long as @xmath675 .",
    "the ejecta does not decelerate at @xmath824 because the medium ahead has a high @xmath0 ; at @xmath772 the medium preacceleration ceases rather abruptly , @xmath825 , and the delayed deceleration occurs violently .",
    "the strong effect of the radiation front on the blast wave formation and dynamics is easily understood .",
    "the front passes energy @xmath826 to an ambient mass @xmath827 ahead of the ejecta , where @xmath828 is the optical depth of @xmath827 ( here 0.2 is a klein - nishina correction and @xmath223 is mass per electron , @xmath829 due to pair loading ) .",
    "as a result the medium is accelerated to a lorentz factor @xmath0 , @xmath830 the front structure solution gives @xmath223 and @xmath0 behind the front ; e.g. @xmath831 at @xmath617 ( @xmath389 ) . at small radii , @xmath832 ,",
    "one gets @xmath833 , i.e. the accelerated medium runs away from the ejecta and the gap is opened .",
    "the ejecta decelerates when it sweeps a sufficient mass @xmath834 .",
    "namely , the deceleration condition reads @xmath835 i.e. the swept inertial mass measured in the ejecta frame equals @xmath626 .",
    "the radius of deceleration is increased if @xmath246 despite the fact that only a small energy @xmath836 was used to preaccelerate the ambient medium .",
    "indeed , we have [ omitting the numerical factor @xmath837 , cf .",

    "the generic prediction is that the early emission of a grb blast wave ( at @xmath842  s ) should be very soft ; they should be multiplied by @xmath843 if @xmath844 . ] .",
    "compared to the standard model that neglects the effects of the radiation front , the peak frequency of synchrotron emission is reduced by the pair loading factor @xmath845 and the preacceleration factor @xmath846 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tnup ] ) .",
    "the early afterglow should start as a relatively weak optical emission at @xmath792 and then the peak frequency moves to the x - ray band ; only at @xmath624 the blast wave sweeps the normal @xmath4-free medium with @xmath211 and emits in the standard regime .",
    "the fraction @xmath847 of the afterglow energy that is emitted at the early soft stage is controlled by the ratio @xmath848 . in the typical ism environment @xmath849% . in the typical wind environment ( massive progenitor scenario )",
    "@xmath850 i.e. most of the blast wave energy is emitted at the early soft stage . in the latter case",
    "we emphasize the likely possibility of `` x - ray - weak '' afterglows whose emission peaks in soft bands throughout the whole evolution of the blast wave ( fig .",
    "the light curves from blast waves in winds have special features which may be easily recognized in observations .",
    "the violent deceleration that happens at @xmath851 should cause a strong peak in the soft light curve",
    ". then one should observe ( 1 ) a steep rise of the afterglow at @xmath852 and ( 2 ) a peak at @xmath853 .",
    "both @xmath854 and @xmath11 depend weakly on the wind parameters in a wide range @xmath855 (   8.2.1 ) . given the observed @xmath2 and @xmath11 one can find the lorentz factor of the ejecta .",
    "if @xmath9 does not vary strongly from burst to burst ( as suggested by the clustering of grb spectral peaks at @xmath25 , see preece et al .",
    "2000 ) there should exist a strong correlation between @xmath11 and the observed isotropic energy @xmath2 of the prompt grb .",
    "4 .   in the massive progenitor scenario , the prompt high - energy @xmath0-rays must be absorbed efficiently by radiation scattered in the wind (   6.2 ) . as a result",
    ", the high - energy tail of the grb spectrum will have a break .",
    "the break position @xmath335 is given by equation  ( [ eq : break_wind ] ) for the idealized case of a burst with a constant flux ; it appears at @xmath856  mev in the beginning of the grb and then slowly shifts with time to higher energies . in highly variable bursts ,",
    "future time - resolved spectroscopy should show a positive correlation between @xmath335 and the instantaneous flux .",
    "once the break is observed one can evaluate the wind density .",
    "the main observational effect of the radiation front is the strong softening of the early blast wave emission ( which would otherwise be in the hard x - ray band ) .",
    "owing to this softening the blast radiates in a different spectral window compared to the prompt grb and it can be studied separately in simultaneous observations .",
    "observations in optical  soft x - ray bands at early times ( less than @xmath493  min ) can help to establish the nature of the grb progenitor  as we discussed here a wind from a massive progenitor should have clear signatures",
    ".    early optical emission has already been detected in grb  990123 ( akerlof et al . 1999 ) and it likely comes from the blast wave rather than internal dissipation in the ejecta since there is no correlation between the optical light curve and the prompt grb .",
    "the optical emission can be produced by the reverse shock in the ejecta ( e.g. sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "the results of the present paper suggest an alternative interpretation : the soft emission is produced by the forward shock at its early stage when it propagates in the preaccelerated and pair - loaded environment .",
    "the emission from the blast _ hardens fast _ when the blast wave propagates in the @xmath4 loaded zone @xmath7 and the observer will see the whole spectrum from optical to x - ray bands .",
    "this broad - band emission can overlap with the prompt grb and its x - ray component can affect the measured grb spectrum . in particular , the early external shock may generate the soft x - ray excesses detected in grbs .    the simple blast wave model constructed in this paper assumes a burst duration @xmath857s ( cf .",
    "  7.2 ) .",
    "after a redshift correction @xmath858 , @xmath859 is still smaller than @xmath856  s , while a number of observed grbs are longer than 10  s. the extension to @xmath593 should be simple since the found front structure in terms of @xmath205 (    46 ) will hold regardless @xmath860 .",
    "however , the blast wave will be affected : ( 1 ) @xmath586 will decrease ( eq .  [ eq : r_c_long ] ) , ( 2 ) @xmath861 [ and hence @xmath862 will change , and ( 3 ) the sweeping - shell approximation (   8) will not work ; instead one has to deal with the full hydrodynamical problem with the forward and reverse shocks .",
