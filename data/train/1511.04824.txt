    "<S> the distortion can be compensated and the wavefront of the transmitted light can be shaped to a desired form , similar to phase compensating antenna arrays employed in the microwave regime  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the desired phase profile of the conformal metasurface is found with the knowledge of the geometry of the transparent object over which it is wrapped , and the desired optical response . </S>",
    "<S> first , the object without the metasurface is considered , and the phase profile of the optical waves transmitted through the object is computed along the surface of the object . for objects with dimensions significantly larger than the optical wavelengths </S>",
    "<S> , this phase profile can be found using ray optics approximation and by computing the optical path length and the corresponding optical path difference ( opd ) of the rays passing through different points along the outermost surface of the object with respect to the chief ray . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig : fig2_design]a ( [ fig : fig2_design]d ) shows the opd of the rays passing through the convex ( concave ) cylinder at its top surface . considering the desired converging spherical wavefront , the desired opd of the rays at the surface of the convex ( concave ) cylinder is calculated and shown in fig .

    "<S> therefore , only a simple geometric transformation ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2_design]a ) is used to map the coordinates on a cylinder surface to a plane .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical coupling among the nano - posts is weak in the high contrast transmitarray metasurface platform , and each nano - post scatters light almost independent of its neighboring nano - posts . the weak coupling is due to the high index contrast between the nano - posts and their surroundings , and it is manifested in the localization of the optical energy inside the nano - posts and the weak dependence of the transmission of the nano - post arrays to their spacing ( i.e. lattice constant ) as has been previously discussed @xcite in more detail . </S>",

    "<S> 1 ) . we also note that in contrast to huygens metasurfaces where only two resonant modes are employed ( one with a significant electric dipole and one with significant magnetic dipole ) @xcite , the resonant modes of the nano - posts contain dipole , quadrupole and higher order electric and magnetic multipoles in their multipole expansion . </S>",
    "<S> although the modal expansion approach provides some intuitive understanding of the operation principle , it does not offer guidelines for designing of the nano - post arrays . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , an effective medium method does not capture the underlying physics of the periodic structures that support more than one propagating mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is not applicable to most of the nano - posts widths we used in designing the metasurface , as a periodic array of nano - posts with diameters greater than 180 nm would be multimode . </S>",
    "<S> considering these , and the limited number of design parameters ( i.e. nano - post height and the lattice constant ) , we prefer the direct approach of finding the transmission of the nano - post arrays ( as shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig2_design]g ) over the modal expansion technique .        </S>",
    "<S> low sensitivity to the incident angle is a necessary property for a conformal metasurface since the incident angle would be varying across the metasurface when it is wrapped over a non - planar object . for the metasurface platform considered here , </S>",
    "<S> the transmission coefficient of transverse electric ( te ) polarized light is weakly dependent on the incidence angle , and transmission coefficient of transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarized light shows some angle dependent resonances ( supplementary note 2 and supplementary fig . </S>",

    "<S> these resonances introduce a small phase error and lower transmission , but as we experimentally show , they only slightly reduce the metasurface efficiency for tm polarization . for very steep angles , the metasurface efficiency decreases as analyzed in our previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general metasurface design procedure is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , the coordinate - transformed desired metasurface phase was sampled at the lattice sites of the periodic hexagonal lattice . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig4_measurement]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the metasurface modifies the cylinder to behave as an aspherical lens focusing light to a point 3.5 mm away from the surface of the cylinder ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4_measurement]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second device is a 2-mm diameter metasurface conforming to a diverging glass cylinder with a radius of 6.48 mm and a focal length of @xmath412.7 mm ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4_measurement]b ) . with the metasurface on top </S>",
    "<S> , the concave cylinder focuses light to a point 8 mm away from the cylinder surface ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4_measurement]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the devices were characterized under 915 nm collimated laser beam illumination by recording intensity profiles at different planes parallel to their focal planes . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : fig4_measurement ] also shows the measured intensity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the focal plane intensity profiles are shown as insets . </S>",
    "<S> a tight focus is observed at the designed focal length . </S>",
    "<S> focusing efficiencies of 56% and 52% under te illumination ( i.e. electrical field parallel to the cylinder axis ) were measured for the two devices , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the focusing efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power focused by the device to the incident power on the device ( see methods for the measurement details ) . under tm illumination , numerical estimations based on the angular response of a uniform array shown in supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 indicate a slight degradation of the device performance for larger angles between the metasurface and the incident beam . </S>",
    "<S> the devices were measured with tm input beam polarizations and , as expected , showed similar behavior as under te illumination with focusing efficiencies of 56% and 50% . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in te and tm polarization efficiencies increases as the incidence angle becomes steeper ( supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) ; the focus pattern , however , remains almost the same under both polarizations ( supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding measured full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the focal spots are approximately 3.5 @xmath5 m and 5 @xmath5 m comparable to diffraction limited fwhm of 3.2 @xmath5 m and 3.7 @xmath5 m , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> slight aberrations observed in the focal plane intensity profiles are mostly due to imperfections in the alignment of the metasurface to the non - planar substrates </S>",
    "<S> . reduction of efficiency in conformal metasurfaces compared to the transferred flat metasurfaces ( supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) is mostly due to the imperfections in the alignment , slight movements of the nano - posts within the flexible substrate during the substrate handling , and the difference between the actual non - planar substrate profile and the profile assumed for design .        </S>",
    "<S> although here we have used cylindrical substrates as proof of principle , this platform is not limited to surfaces that can be projected to a plane using isometric transformations . </S>",
    "<S> conformal metasurfaces can be designed for other types of objects ( for instance spheres where the metasurface needs to be stretched for conforming ) with a similar method . </S>",
    "<S> high stretchability and flexibility of thin pdms layers ( @xmath650 @xmath5 m ) make them suitable for conforming to non - isometric surfaces . in such cases , however , a mechanical analysis of the metasurface deformation upon mounting on the object should be carried out . the coordinate transformation that projects the conformal lattice to the planar one should also account for this deformation . besides , in the case of objects with steep angles ( where the incident collimated beam is far from normal to the metasurface at some points ) , further considerations should be taken in choosing the lattice constant to avoid excitation of higher order diffractions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the design procedure is local ( i.e. each nano - post at each lattice site is chosen independently ) , the incident angle of the beam at each lattice point can be taken into account in designing the respective nano - post .    </S>",
    "<S> conformal dielectric metasurfaces operate based on spatially varying nano - structured diffractive scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the device is wavelength dependent because both the optical response of the scatterers and their arrangement is optimized for a given wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the proposed devices has a wavelength dependence similar to other high contrast transmitarray lenses recently demonstrated @xcite where good performance is maintained over a bandwidth of a few percent around the design wavelength .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed platform is relatively robust to systematic and random errors . </S>",
    "<S> fabrication errors do not affect the device functionality and only reduce its efficiency ( 5 nm error in nano - post diameters results in @xmath63@xmath7 reduction of efficiency @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> alignment imperfections ( extra stretch or angular rotation ) results in focal distance mismatch between the nonplanar object and the metasurface . </S>",
    "<S> microlens focal distance has second order dependence on the substrate stretch ratio . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for the devices shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4_measurement ] , having 1@xmath7 strain in the flexible metasurface results in a 2@xmath7 error in focal distance and a 1 degree rotation misalignment results in 0.06@xmath7 mismatch between the horizontal and vertical focal distances . also , fractional wavelength error is equal to the fractional error of the focal distance @xcite ( i.e. 1@xmath7 error in wavelength results in  1@xmath7 error in focal distance of the flexible metasurface ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the developed fabrication process has a near unity yield ( more than 99.5@xmath7 ) and we are able to transfer almost all of the nano - posts into the pdms with good accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the proposed platform is very robust to the fabrication deficiencies ; various imperfections including deviations between designed and fabricated nano - post sizes ( @xmath65 nm in the diameter and ( or ) height of the nano - posts ) , rough side walls , and missing nano - posts ( @xmath610@xmath7 ) only result in small reductions in the efficiency of the device , and does not alter the functionality significantly .    in conclusion , we demonstrated flexible dielectric metasurfaces and showed their applications for conformal optics . </S>",
    "<S> as proof of concept , the optical properties of glass cylinders have been changed to behave like aspherical lenses focusing light to a point . the design paradigm can be applied to any other system where conformal optical design is required . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , flexible electronics is a well - established field of research , with the aim of transferring conventional systems to flexible and non - planar substrates . </S>",
    "<S> very promising results have been achieved during the last decade with various applications in wearable electronics , electronic skins , and medical devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the flexible and conformal metasurface platform proposed here can be merged with conformal electronics leading to versatile flexible optoelectronic technologies . </S>"
