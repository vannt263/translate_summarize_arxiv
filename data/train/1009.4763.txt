    "in the last decade a series of experiments has been performed on elastic scattering of unstable nuclei at energies around the coulomb barrier .",
    "it has been found that the scattering cross sections show a significantly different behavior for weakly bound projectiles compared to tightly bound projectiles like e.g.  the @xmath1  particle .",
    "the small binding energy of valence nucleons in orbitals with small angular momentum leads to wave functions which extend to very large radii , exceeding by far the usual @xmath7 radius dependence . due to the corresponding long range absorption the fresnel diffraction peak in the elastic scattering angular distribution",
    "is damped , and the elastic scattering cross section at backward angles is relatively small . as a consequence ,",
    "the derived total reaction cross section @xmath8  for these exotic nuclei ( e.g.  @xmath2he ) is much larger than for tightly bound projectile ( e.g.  @xmath1  particle ) induced reactions .",

    "see the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "moreover , a series of theoretical investigations @xcite on @xmath2he  elastic scattering has been performed in the last years ; they are also summarized in the review articles by keeley and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the present study reanalyzes recently published data of the @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  elastic scattering cross section @xcite which filled the gap between targets with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we compare these results to @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  elastic scattering data which have been obtained in the same experiment .",
    "the similarities and the differences of the weakly bound projectile @xmath2he  and the tightly bound projectile @xmath1  are nicely visible in this comparison .",
    "the present study uses double folding potentials for the real part of the potential ; this type of potentials is widely used in literature .",
    "the imaginary part is parametrized by woods - saxon potentials .",
    "the parameters of the potentials are restricted by the systematics of volume integrals which was found for many @xmath1-nucleus systems @xcite ; this systematics was successfully extended to @xmath2he  in @xcite .",
    "further information on the @xmath0sn-@xmath1  potential is obtained from the analysis of angular distributions at higher energies @xcite and excitation functions at lower energies @xcite .",
    "the most important quantity for the description of elastic scattering data below and around the coulomb barrier are the reflexion coefficients @xmath3 which define the total reaction cross section .",

    "the imaginary diffuseness is fixed here at a standard value @xmath104fm .",
    "the reduced radius parameter @xmath84 is constant above 20mev and identical to the analysis of @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  scattering at the highest measured energy . only at very low energies",
    "either @xmath86 has to be reduced , or @xmath63 and a reduced imaginary radius @xmath127fm have to be used . in any case , there is no significant broadening of the @xmath111 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath4 curve ; a significant broadening of @xmath111 is only seen for the @xmath2he  case .",
    "we have repeated the above analysis of the slope @xmath111 with the original woods - saxon potentials which were fitted to the experimental @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  data @xcite .",
    "the same general behavior of @xmath114 and @xmath115 is found from this analysis ( see open symbols in fig .  [",
    "fig : eta_shift ] ) .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that the experimental @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  data clearly require a larger value @xmath114 and an increasing width @xmath116 at lower energies .",
    "this finding is independent whether systematic folding potentials or fitted woods - saxon potentials are applied in the analysis .",
    "consequently , this increase of the width @xmath116 in the @xmath111 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath4 curve may be taken as a signature for the halo properties of the @xmath2he  projectile . whereas @xmath116 changes by about @xmath128 for @xmath119 between 0.85mev and 1.85mev in the @xmath1  case , an one order of magnitude stronger variation of about @xmath129 within a much smaller range of @xmath130 is found for the @xmath2he  case : @xmath131 halo properties",
    "may be assigned as soon as the variation of @xmath116 with @xmath119 is clearly below a value of @xmath132mev around @xmath133mev .",
    "the increase of the imaginary radius parameter @xmath84 has been explained in @xcite with the fact that the area where reactions may occur moves to larger distances at lower energies .",
    "this has been clearly shown e.g.  for low - energy capture data in the @xmath134o(p,@xmath135)@xmath136f reaction @xcite .",
    "further work is required to follow this idea in more detail .",
    "the systematic behavior of the potentials in the real and imaginary parts may be used as the basis for the construction of a simple global @xmath2hepotential . because of the smooth variation of all parameters the predictive power of such a global @xmath2he  potential should be very good . in particular , it has to be pointed out that the so - called `` threshold anomaly '' is avoided in the present study .",
    "such `` threshold anomalies '' , i.e.  potentials with a strong or unusual energy dependence at energies around the coulomb barrier , or with unusual geometry parameters like e.g.  a huge imaginary diffuseness @xmath86 of several fm , had to be used in many studies to reproduce the huge total reaction cross sections of halo nuclei around the barrier ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for a deeper discussion of threshold anomalies and dynamic polarization potentials , see e.g.  @xcite ) .    for completeness , it has also to be pointed out that an unusually large reaction cross section is not already a clear signature of a halo wave function .",
    "such an unusual @xmath8 only indicates the strong coupling to other channels which may not at all be related to halo properties .",
    "e.g. , such a behavior has been found in the elastic scattering of @xmath137o by @xmath138w where the coupling to the low - lying @xmath76 state of @xmath138w leads to an unusual elastic scattering angular distribution and a huge @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we have presented new experimental data for @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  elastic scattering at energies around and slightly above the coulomb barrier which were measured simultaneously with a recent @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  experiment .",
    "the data are successfully analyzed using systematic folding potentials in the real part and smoothly varying woods - saxon potentials in the imaginary part .",
    "these potentials are also able to reproduce @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  angular distributions at higher energies and excitation functions at lower energies which are available in literature .",
    "a comparison with the @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  scattering data shows that similar potentials with a smooth mass and energy dependence are also able to reproduce these data .",
    "thus , this smoothly varying potential may be used as the basis for the construction of simple global @xmath2he  potential with expected good predictive power .",
    "the halo properties of @xmath2he  lead to an enhanced total reaction cross section at low energies which is related to a relatively small elastic scattering cross section at intermediate and backward angles . this behavior requires   as the only special feature for the @xmath2he  case   an energy - dependent radius parameter @xmath84 which increases towards lower energies .",
    "such an increase of the radius parameter @xmath84 is not seen in the new @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  data and was also not found in a series of high precision @xmath1  scattering of neighboring target nuclei around 20mev . at very low energies",
    "even an opposite trend is seen in the analysis of the excitation functions of @xcite .",
    "the increase of the radius parameter @xmath84 of the @xmath2he  potential towards lower energies is related to a relatively smooth rise of the reflexion coefficients @xmath3 as a function of angular momentum @xmath4 . in particular",
    ", it is found that the width @xmath116 of the almost gaussian shaped slope @xmath111 is significantly larger for @xmath2he  compared to @xmath1 .",
    "the width @xmath116 shows an increase towards lower energies for @xmath2he  which is not present in the @xmath1  scattering data .",
    "this characteristic behavior of the @xmath2he  data can be used as a signature for the halo properties of @xmath2he , and it should be tested as a general signature of halo properties in elastic scattering in other cases like e.g.  @xmath15be .",
    "we suggest a value below @xmath132mev at @xmath139mev as signature for halo properties .",
    "although the quality of the presented new @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  scattering data is clearly inferior compared to recent high precision data in this mass region , only the combined analysis of the new data for @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  scattering together with angular distributions at higher energies and excitation functions at lower energies enables the comparison between @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sn  and @xmath0sn(@xmath2he,@xmath2he)@xmath0sn  elastic scattering and the derivation of the above new results .",
    "we thank i.  brida and f.  nunes for providing their numerical results of the @xmath2he  density .",
