    "evidence for lepton flavour violation ( lvf ) has been provided by the neutrino oscillation experiments . in the charged - lepton sector , processes that would provide additional evidence for lvf and help distinguish among the various proposed mechanisms , include the exotic neutrinoless conversion of a muon to an electron - where the neutrino and antineutrino involved in the conversion are assumed to be majorana particles and can annihilate each other .    in this context , the exotic conversion of a bound muon to an electron @xmath4 has been studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . the experimentally measured quantity is the ratio of the coherent rate , where the nucleus remains in its ground state , over the total capture rate .",

    "let us first examine the behavior of the self - consistent crpa model .",
    "as the values of @xmath122 show , about 90% of the total transition rate was spurious in all cases .",
    "we expect this result to be independent of the nucleus and the interaction used , because the spurious state at low energy always dominates the isoscalar dipole strength distribution ( which contributes in all three mechanisms ) and because the corrected operators are , by construction , most effective for this state ( thus removing practically all its strength ) .",
    "we were not able to demonstrate this in the particular case of @xmath2ca , because the energy of the spurious state in this case was found imaginary .",
    "in other words , we were not able to evaluate and take into account properly the strength of the spurious state , before or after the correction . therefore , the respective numbers in table  [ table1 ] are placed in brackets .",
    "suppose now that , in order to evaluate the rate coming from intrinsic @xmath3 excitations , we would apply the procedure of using the @xmath105 operators and then simply excluding the strength of the spurious state from calculating the total rate .",
    "as the values of @xmath120 show , for @xmath1pb , we would have removed roughly as large a portion as @xmath122 .",
    "again , for @xmath2ca it is not possible to conclude .    from table  [ table1 ]",
    "we notice that for @xmath121 and for @xmath10 the result is small in absolute value , but negative , for @xmath1pb .",
    "it represents the numerical accuracy of our calculation and , being small , it indicates that the degree of self consistency reached by our hf+crpa model is sufficient to achieve a satisfactory separation of the spurious transition in this case .",
    "for the @xmath11 and @xmath13 cases , however , spurious admixtures of more than 6% are found above 6  mev .",
    "these numbers ( which are not free of numerical inaccuracies , as explained in ref .",

    "the values of @xmath123 for the @xmath76 and @xmath13 mechanisms are lower than 10% as well .",
    "its value for @xmath11-exchange is much larger .",
    "most of it , however , comes from below 15  mev ( below the gdr region ) .",
    "when the ncrpa model is used , similar results are obtained for @xmath122 and @xmath120 as with the self - consistent model .",
    "the @xmath1pb excitation spectrum above the tail of the spurious state is a little more contaminated than within the self - consistent crpa , as the @xmath123 values show . as for the @xmath2ca nucleus ,",
    "when corrected operators were used , the strength above 6  mev was significantly increased .",
    "thus , the corresponding values of @xmath123 are large and negative , indicating a bad performance of the model .    from our results ,",
    "obtained for two nuclei within two different continuum - rpa models , one may conclude that more than 85% of the total @xmath3 rate , when no correction is considered , is spurious . whether effective operators are used to remove the total spurious strength , or whether one excludes the spurious state from the calculation of the total @xmath3 ,",
    "the above conclusion remains the same .",
    "this does not mean that there are no spurious contaminations above the zero - energy spurious mode . when making use of corrected operators , the strength of the excited states across the spectrum is redistributed .",
    "the overall effect , however , is to reduce the total @xmath124 rate by the amount that was initially carried by the spurious state .    within the qrpa calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , for six nuclei ( including @xmath1pb ) , a more moderate correction ( less than 60% ) on @xmath124 was achieved by considering the lowest @xmath3 state as purely spurious and simply excluding it .",
