    "while the frg approach only applies to weak - couplings , that is , bare coupling strengths small compared to the full energy bandwidth of the problem ( of order @xmath162 ) , the ratio of @xmath21 can be tuned to be very large , enhancing the value of @xmath158 for @xmath3-cdw .",
    "our predicted phase diagram should be experimentally realizable with recently achieved quantum degenerate li - k mixtures  @xcite or li - yb  @xcite on a square optical lattice .",
    "we point out that a sufficiently large inter - species interaction @xmath17 compared to the intra - species repulsion of the species at half - filling @xmath163 is needed to create the @xmath3-cdw we propose here . taking the @xmath5li-@xmath6k mixture , for example , with @xmath6k as the @xmath25-fermions at half - filling",
    ", one can tune @xmath163 with a magnetic feshbach resonance ( @xmath164 at around 210 gauss ) . at magnetic fields in this range ,",
    "the @xmath5li - @xmath5li interaction @xmath165 is small and repulsive , as is the interspecies interaction @xmath17 .",
    "one can therefore use the @xmath6k feshbach resonance to tune the @xmath21 ratio to large values , as required for our predicted @xmath3-cdw phase to occur .",
    "one may also combine magnetic field with confinement - induced resonance  @xcite . to avoid breaking su(2 ) symmetry , optical feshbach resonances  @xcite",
    "may also be explored .",
    "the all optical resonance has been used in fermionic systems  @xcite , including the @xmath5li-@xmath6k mixture  @xcite .",
    "importantly , it is not necessary to have @xmath166 for our predictions to hold true .",
    "if these parameters are different , the phase diagram as a function of the ratio @xmath21 remains qualitatively unchanged , with no strong dependence on the value of @xmath165 .",
    "experimental candidates for realizing this mixture , such as @xmath5li-@xmath6k mixture , have components with different values for their physical masses .",
    "the qualitative features of the phase diagram , however , do not require @xmath167 .",
    "if the @xmath19-fermion , which is the species not at half - filling , is lighter than the @xmath25-fermion , the screening effect from @xmath19-fermions becomes even more effective than in the equal mass case , and the @xmath3-cdw phase is further enhanced . if the @xmath19-fermions are heavier , the screening effect becomes less effective and , for @xmath19-fermions much heavier than @xmath25-fermions , the @xmath3-cdw will eventually be completely suppressed .",
    "therefore , for a @xmath5li-@xmath6k mixture , having the @xmath6k atoms be the @xmath25-fermions ( half - filled ) is more favorable for the emergence of @xmath3-cdw order .",
    "these features provide more flexibility for the experimental realization of the @xmath3-cdw phase we predict .",
    "experiments with @xmath5li-@xmath6k mixtures@xcite have achieved @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the values we find for @xmath158 using frg are only rough estimates , but they are of the same order of magnitude as these experimental values . as the calculation of @xmath158 indicates , a sufficiently large inter - species interaction ( @xmath17 ) compared to the intra - species repulsion of the species at half - filling ( @xmath163 )",
    "is needed to create the @xmath3-cdw phase with a realistic value for @xmath158 .",
    "identification of order parameters with nonzero angular - momentum dependence is always a challenge topic in condensed matter systems , and requires measurement of the relative phase between different portions of the fs .",
    "several methods have been proposed to perform such phase - sensitive measurements  @xcite , including a pump - probe scheme  @xcite and an approach based on noise correlations@xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-cdw order parameter symmetry may also be detected via momentum - resolved spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied a quantum degenerate fermi - fermi mixture on square lattice with different species density and interaction ratios .",
    "we have employed the frg , which goes beyond the mean - field approximation , to determine phase diagram of the system and to evaluate corresponding critical temperatures . by keeping one species at half - filling and varying the other",
    ", we found several phases , such as @xmath170-cdw , sdw , and most important @xmath3-cdw . when inter - species density - density interaction is strong enough ,",
    "system is dominated by charge density waves . for a small density imbalance between different species",
    ", our frg result shows that the @xmath3-cdw dominates over the conventional @xmath170-cdw . to clarify the physics behind the formation of this unconventional charge density wave",
    ", we considered an simple four - patch model , which shows clearly that the density imbalance makes umklapp interactions flow asymmetrically . along with frg calculation , our study has allowed us to understand the structure of the phase diagram on a qualitative level .",
    "finally , we have also proposed an experimental realization of our theoretical system involving on li - k mixture , and discussed how to fine tune the interaction ratios to achieve the parameter range necessary to observe the phenomena we predict .",
    "based on current cold atom technology , we believe this experiment can be realized in the near future .",
