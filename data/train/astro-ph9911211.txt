    "there are now seven known eclipsing binary pulsars ( see table 1 ) . in each system",
    "the eclipses are longer than expected for a secondary confined to its roche lobe . from this",
    "it is inferred that there is continuous mass flow from the secondary , constantly replenishing a volume larger than its roche lobe .",
    "the mass loss may be due to roche lobe overflow , stellar wind , or a combination , and in some cases is induced by heating of the secondary by pulsar irradiation .",
    "observation of ionized material at eclipse edges , detected as dispersion measure increases , confirms this picture .",

    "mass loss rates estimated from the dispersion and attenuation of radio signals traveling through the ionized wind suggest the secondaries will not be ablated within a hubble time , unless there is a large , undetected neutral component to the wind . the key question of interest is : how do these systems evolve ?",
    "can they , in fact , evaporate their secondaries , or are there similar systems that can ?",
    "can planets form from the mass outflow ? and how are they related to low mass x - ray binaries , such as saxj1808.4@xmath03658 ( van der klis , this volume ) ?",
    "we have made timing observations of two eclipsing binaries over a span of ten years .",
    "observations of psr  b1957 + 20 were made at arecibo at 430mhz from 1988 to 1994 and at green bank at 575mhz from 1994 to 1999 .",
    "observations of psr  b1744@xmath024a were made at the vla at 1660mhz from 1990 to 1999 and at green bank at 800 , 1330 , and 1600mhz , also from 1990 to 1999 .",
    "we used tempo for our initial analysis of pulse arrival times . after removing the standard spin - down and keplerian orbital model , systematic residual arrival times remained .",
    "we analyzed these residuals by fitting small subsets of the data for offsets in pulsar rotation phase , orbital phase , and orbit size ( projected semi - major axis ) .",
    "for a uniformly sampled orbit , these phenomena perturb the timing data in orthogonal ways : a pulse rotation offset uniformly affects arrival times at all orbital phases ; an orbital phase offset induces excess delays proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the orbital phase , measured from the ascending node ; and an orbital size change induces excess delay proportional to @xmath8 . at green bank and the vla , entire orbits were observed on a single day , so we independently analyzed each observing epoch .",
    "arecibo observations had poor orbital coverage on any given day , so we analyzed these data in intervals of 100 days .",
    "results of this analysis are given in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the psr  b1957 + 20 system is undergoing apparently random variations in orbital period , with magnitude @xmath9 and a time scale of @xmath10years ( figure 1c ) .",
    "this agrees with the conclusion of arzoumanian , fruchter , & taylor ( 1994 ) , who analyzed the arecibo data from 1988 to 1993 .",
    "they found the orbital period first decreased and then increased , and predicted that the binary period would exhibit `` small quasi - periodic oscillations . ''",
    "a possible source of the period variations is deformation of the secondary by magnetic activity , which in turn is produced by dissipation of tidal energy ( applegate & shaham 1994 ) .",
    "modest `` timing noise '' is evident in the pulsar signal ( figure 1a ) .",
    "this could be simple variation in dispersion measure  this source has not been regularly observed at multiple frequencies . however ,",
    "similarity to the psr  b1744@xmath024a timing noise ( see below ) suggests the origin may lie within the system itself .",
    "the orbital perturbations of psr  b1744@xmath024a , of order @xmath11 , are smaller than those of psr  b1957 + 20 .",
    "a secular downward trend fits the data reasonably well , though not perfectly ( figures 2b , c ) .",
    "( the specific model plotted was derived from a timing fit to all data , and is essentially equivalent to a quadratic fit to the data in figure 2b . )",
    "the evolutionary time scale inferred from this model is @xmath12myr .",
    "this is within an order of magnitude of the orbital decay time scale from gravitational radiation , @xmath13myr .",
    "it seems likely that gr plays a substantial role in the evolution of this system .",
    "the pulsar phase residuals of psr  b1744@xmath024a pose an interesting puzzle .",
    "there are systematic variations in pulse arrival time of order @xmath14ms ( figure 2a ) .",
    "these excess residuals are largely independent of frequency .",
    "( small frequency - dependent differences in arrival times , interpreted as slow changes in dispersion measure , have been removed from the figure . )",
    "there are several possible origins of these residuals :    1 .",
    "_ `` timing noise '' intrinsic to the pulsar rotation .",
    "_ however , timing noise of this magnitude is not seen in other spun - up pulsars .",
    "for example , the relatively noisy residuals of psrb1937 + 21 reported by kaspi , taylor , & ryba ( 1994 ) show a peak - to - peak excursion of only @xmath15s over more than 8 years , more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the residuals we measure for psrb1744@xmath024a .",
    "changes in the viewing geometry of the emission region relative to the line of sight .",
    "_ psr  b1744@xmath024a is expected to precess at a rate of @xmath16/yr , so a substantial change in viewing angle is possible over 10 years of observations .",
    "however , the pulsar has presumably been spun up by accretion of mass and angular momentum from the secondary , aligning the pulsar s angular momentum with the orbital angular momentum . with this near alignment",
    ", precession effects would be difficult to detect .",
    "changes in the distance between the entire binary system ( pulsar and secondary ) and the earth_. this could be caused by a lumpy `` excretion disk '' , which could serve as a precursor to planet formation around the pulsar ( banit & shaham 1992 ; banit et al .",
    "the data are suggestive towards this end  a periodic 1ms signal in the residuals , with a period of 5yr , would correspond to an orbit of a 0.3m@xmath17 object about the binary system .",
    "however , there are no clean periodic signals , so a model like this must invoke a stochastic `` background '' of lumps ( asteroids ? ) .",
    "_ torques on the pulsar due to infalling matter .",
    "_ the eclipses in this system are highly variable , and the pulsar signal sometimes disappears for several orbits ( or possibly longer ) .",
    "this suggests mass may be flowing close to the pulsar , which could be accreted or interact via the `` propeller effect '' , in either case causing a torque on the pulsar , changing the rotation period",
    ". such accretion might be identifiable by x - ray observations of the source at times when the radio signal is not visible .",
    "intriguingly , bursts were seen from this general direction by the hakucho satellite in 1980 ( makishima et al . 1981 ) , but due to low angular resolution of this telescope and confusion from sources in the dense galactic center region , any connection between the bursts and psr b1744@xmath024a must be considered speculative .    much of the 1957 + 20 data from arecibo was collected by a. s. fruchter , m. f. ryba , and j. h. taylor .",
