    "the discovery of sn  1998bw , probably associated with grb 980425 ( e.g. ,  galama et  al .",
    "1998 ) , provided the first direct evidence that supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may be related .",
    "analysis of the sn  1998bw data showed that this was a peculiar type ic supernova ( sn  ic ; see filippenko 1997 for a summary of sn classifications ) , with a very large explosion energy , some 3050 times the energy of an ordinary core - collapse sn ( @xmath3 erg ) .",
    "for this reason , sn  1998bw was called a `` hypernova '' ( iwamoto et  al .  1998 ;",
    "nakamura et  al .  2001 ) .    while an effort was made to establish whether other sne were linked to grbs ( wang & wheeler 1998 ) , additional sne were studied which show the typical characteristics of `` hypernovae , '' namely a high kinetic energy per unit mass , exemplified by broad spectral features ; see mazzali et  al .  ( 2003a ) , and references therein . since not all of them are extremely luminous , but are spectrally similar to sn  1998bw , they have also been dubbed `` sn 1998bw - like sne  ic '' ( foley et al . 2003 ) .",
    "analysis of one of these objects in particular , sn  1997ef , showed that its kinetic energy is @xmath4 erg , less than the energy of sn  1998bw but still very large ( iwamoto et  al .",
    "2000 ; mazzali et  al .",
    "sn  1997ef was estimated to have synthesized @xmath5 of @xmath2ni , or about twice the amount produced by normal core - collapse sne , although again less than that of sn  1998bw .",
    "a clear connection with a grb could not be established for sn  1997ef , yet a possible candidate was found ( grb 971115 ; wang & wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "the common features of sne 1997ef and 1998bw are the broad absorption troughs in the spectra near maximum brightness , indicating the presence of high - velocity ejecta , and the luminous and extended light curve .",
    "other examples of sn  1998bw - like sne  ic are sn  2003dh / grb030329 ( stanek et  al .",

    "2002 ; leonard et  al .  2002",
    "; foley et  al .",
    "2003 ) , which was less energetic and is thought to have synthesized only @xmath6 of @xmath2ni ; and recently sn  2003lw / grb031203 ( tagliaferri et  al .",

    "the study of sn  1998bw extended to late times .",
    "the spectrum turned nebular after @xmath7 days , while the light curve showed a phase of exponential decline .",
    "this can be interpreted as being due to the presence of an inner high - density region ( nakamura et  al .",
    "2001 ; nomoto et  al .  2001 ; maeda et  al .",
    "the fully nebular spectrum of sn  1998bw showed broad lines , with the peculiarity that the oxygen lines were narrower than the iron lines .",
    "this is difficult to interpret in the context of a 1-dimensional , spherically symmetric model , but it can be explained if the explosion was asymmetric ( mazzali et  al .  2001 ;",
    "maeda et  al .  2002 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "sn  1997ef retained a photospheric - type spectrum , with absorption lines of progressively lower velocity , up to the last previously studied spectrum , dating @xmath8 months after the explosion ( mazzali et  al .",
    "2000 ) , when some evidence of nebular emission is also present .",
    "the long duration of the photospheric phase can also be interpreted as the consequence of the presence of an inner , high - density region , but in this case the density contrast between such a region and the outer ejecta may be larger ( maeda et  al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze spectra of sn  1997ef extending beyond the previous study ( to epochs of @xmath94 months ) , and show that at comparable epochs , while sn  1998bw had a fully nebular spectrum , sn  1997ef still retains a photosphere .",
    "we study these spectra with a double - barreled approach , dividing them into a photospheric and a nebular part , and obtain an estimate of the mass of @xmath2ni  powering the spectrum at these intermediate epochs .",
    "unfortunately , no good spectra of sn  1997ef exist at later times .",
    "however , another peculiar sn  ic , sn  1997dq , was shown by matheson et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) to be very similar to sn  1997ef . combining the light curves of these two sne we generate a `` sn",
    "1997ef - like '' extended light curve .",
    "this is particularly useful because sn  1997dq does have a good - quality spectrum obtained in the fully nebular epoch ( @xmath10 days ) .",
    "this spectrum can thus be used to determine directly the mass of @xmath2ni  produced by sn  1997dq and , by analogy , by sn  1997ef .",
    "this can be compared to the result obtained from the light curve near peak .",
    "sn  1997ef , a peculiar sn  ic , was classified as a hypernova both by branch ( 2001 ) , who found a kinetic energy of @xmath11 erg from spectral fits , and by iwamoto et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who derived from a simultaneous study of the light curve and the spectra the values @xmath12@xmath13 erg , @xmath14@xmath15 , and @xmath16(@xmath2ni)@xmath17 .",
    "iwamoto et  al .",
    "suggested that sn 1997ef was the result of the collapse of the stripped co core of a star having a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass of @xmath1835@xmath19 . following the probable association between sn  1998bw and grb 980425",
    ", wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) looked for other possible associations between sne and grbs , and suggested that grb 971115 may be compatible with sn  1997ef in position and time of occurrence , although the correlation is much weaker than for sn  1998bw and grb 980425 and thus the link between the sn and the grb can not be proved .",
    "mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) analyzed a series of photospheric - epoch spectra of sn  1997ef . using spectroscopic dating on the 1997 nov .",
    "29 spectrum ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , they estimated that the explosion occurred on nov .",
    "20 @xmath20 day .",
    "they derived the density and abundance distributions in the ejecta , and found that typical sn  ic abundances describe sn  1997ef very well , but their results differed from the explosion model used to describe the light curve in two ways : ( 1 ) the outer density structure turned out to be rather flat ( a power law with index @xmath21 ) , so that the very broad absorption features , extending to @xmath22 km  s@xmath23 , could be reproduced , and ( 2 ) matter was found to be present at low velocities ( @xmath24 km  s@xmath23 ) , which is well below the low - velocity cutoff of the spherically symmetric explosion model ( 5000 km  s@xmath23 ) .",
    "their most important conclusion is that a hypernova model with @xmath12@xmath25 erg , @xmath14@xmath26 , and @xmath16(@xmath2ni)@xmath27 ( model co100 ) gives a good representation of the light curve and the spectra .",
    "a synthetic light curve obtained with this modified density structure fits the observations near the peak quite nicely , and mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that if an additional @xmath28 of @xmath2ni  is contained at low velocities and high densities , then the observed slowing down of the light curve between days 60 and 160 might be explained by the ensuing additional deposition of @xmath29-rays .",
    "they also suggested that the distribution of @xmath2ni  may be aspherical .",
    "a more conclusive determination of the @xmath2ni  mass could be obtained from the nebular spectra .",
    "mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) only extended their study to the first @xmath8 months .",
    "the last spectrum they analyzed , dated 1998 jan .",
    "26 , has an epoch of 67 days after the explosion .",
    "superposed on the photospheric spectrum , this spectrum showed net emission in [ o  i ] @xmath306300 , [ ca  ii ] @xmath307300 , and the ca  ii  near - infrared triplet , which is typical of sne  ic .",
    "matheson et  al .  ( 2001 ) presented spectra of sn  1997ef obtained at later epochs .",
    "only two of these spectra can be used for modelling : those observed on 1998 march 7 and march 26 . the 1998 sep .",
    "21 spectrum is unfortunately too noisy , even after smoothing or rebinning , and it has almost no signal in the blue . according to the spectral dating of mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the explosion took place on 1997 nov .",
    "20 ; hence , the two useable spectra have epochs of 107 and 126 days , respectively . at such epochs , the spectra of sn  1998bw were essentially fully nebular .",
    "in contrast , for sn  1997ef this is not the case : despite the greatly increased strength of the emission lines , a comparison with the 1998 jan .",
    "26 spectrum shows that both march spectra are still dominated by p - cygni profiles superposed on a cool continuum , which is almost flat in the optical .",
    "thus , the march spectra can be divided into two components , one photospheric and one nebular .",
    "because it is interesting to determine the properties of both components , we modelled the march spectra using a double - barrelled approach : we reproduce the photospheric component using our monte carlo code ( mazzali 2000 ) , which gives us information on the luminosity , the photospheric velocity , and the abundances , but is not able to reproduce net nebular line emission .",
    "this is then reproduced with our non - lte ( nlte ) nebular spectral code ( e.g. ,  mazzali et  al .",
    "2001 ) , from which the @xmath2ni  mass contributing to powering the nebular spectrum can be determined .",
    "the sum of the two component spectra should reproduce the observations .",
    "we have therefore adopted the following modelling procedure .",
    "first , the spectra were calibrated according to the @xmath31 magnitude obtained by interpolating the light curve .",
    "second , the spectra were modelled with our photospheric - epoch monte carlo code .",
    "finally , the remaining net emission was modelled using our nlte nebular code .",
    "the main results are outlined in the next two sections .",
    "the photospheric component requires a cool spectrum .",
    "the monte carlo model requires @xmath32 erg s@xmath23 and @xmath33 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "this , combined with the epoch , gives @xmath34  k , and the synthetic spectrum has @xmath35 mag , @xmath36 mag , and bolometric correction ( bc ) = @xmath37 mag .",
    "oxygen , silicon , and sulfur dominate the ejecta .",
    "the iron abundance is small .",
    "the synthetic spectrum reproduces reasonably well the blue part of the observed spectrum ( @xmath38   ) , and the p - cygni lines of o  i  @xmath307770 , the ca  ii  near - ir triplet , and s  i  @xmath309220 . in the synthetic spectrum ,",
    "the fe  ii  feature near 5000    is too deep , and the ca  ii  near - ir triplet absorption does not extend far enough in the blue , probably because of our model grid .",
    "the emission features which are not reproduced are as mentioned above for the 1998 jan .",
    "26 spectrum ( i.e. ,  [ o  i ] @xmath306300 , [ ca  ii ] @xmath307300 , and the ca  ii  near - ir triplet ) , plus a weak line near 5550  (probably [ o  i ] @xmath305577 ) .",
    "we modelled the residual emission spectrum trying to fit the strongest uncontaminated lines , [ o  i ] @xmath306300 and [ ca  ii ] @xmath307300 .",
    "the lines are rather narrow , requiring an outer velocity of the nebula of 5000 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "note that at a comparable epoch sn  1998bw had line half - widths of @xmath39 km  s@xmath23 in both [ o  i ] and [ fe  ii ] .",
    "it is not possible to isolate [ fe  ii ] emission in sn  1997ef , so an estimate of the @xmath2ni  mass must rely on fitting the [ o  i ] line and not exceeding the total observed flux in the [ fe  ii ] region .",
    "we found that a nebula containing @xmath40 of @xmath2ni , @xmath41 of o , @xmath42 of si , and smaller masses of other elements gives a good fit to the observed residual emission spectrum .",
    "the line at 6500    is reproduced as [ si  i ] @xmath306527 .    significant clumping ( volume filling factor @xmath43 ) is adopted in analogy with sn  1998bw ( mazzali et  al .",
    "this is necessary to keep the ionization sufficiently low that [ fe  iii ] lines do not form .",
    "the luminosity of the nebular spectrum is @xmath44 erg s@xmath23 .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to a @xmath29-ray deposition fraction @xmath45 for a @xmath2ni  mass of @xmath40 .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed spectrum , the monte carlo synthetic spectrum , the nebular spectrum , and the sum of the latter two .",
    "the combined synthetic spectrum reproduces the observations well , including an improved fit in the 5000    region .",
    "regions of low line opacity ( @xmath46   , @xmath47   ) are not well reproduced because our monte carlo model assumes a sharp photosphere as the lower boundary .",
    "the total luminosity of the spectrum is then @xmath48 erg s@xmath23 , or @xmath49 mag .",
    "the luminosity of the photospheric component alone corresponds to the complete deposition of @xmath29-rays and positron from @xmath50  of @xmath2ni , indicating that this is the minimum value of the @xmath2ni  mass located below @xmath51 .",
    "the real value is probably larger , as many of the @xmath29-rays probably escape .",
    "thus , the total mass of @xmath2ni  is at least @xmath52      the differences between this spectrum and the previous one are small .",
    "a photosphere is still present .",
    "the depth of the absorption in the fe  iiregion is reduced , and the relative importance of net emission is greater , including now clearly [ o  i ] @xmath305577 .    the monte carlo model requires @xmath53 erg s@xmath23 and @xmath54 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "we obtain @xmath55  k , and the spectrum has @xmath56 mag , @xmath57 mag , and @xmath58 mag .",
    "the elements o , si , and s dominate the ejecta . the fe abundance is smaller than on march 7 .",
    "the fit is similar to that of march 7 .",
    "the nebula has @xmath59 km  s@xmath23 , and it contains @xmath40 of @xmath2ni , @xmath60 of o , @xmath42 of si , and smaller masses of other elements .",
    "clumping is again assumed .",
    "the nebular spectrum has @xmath61 erg s@xmath23 , i.e. ,  @xmath62 .",
    "the o mass changes significantly in the two models , while other masses do not .",
    "unfortunately , determinations of the o mass are intrinsically very uncertain ( e.g. ,  mazzali et  al .",
    "2001 ) , and the values derived here should be regarded as only approximate .",
    "the combined synthetic spectrum is a reasonably good fit to the observed one ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the total luminosity of the spectrum is @xmath32 erg s@xmath23 , i.e. ,  @xmath63 mag .",
    "the luminosity of the photospheric component corresponds to the complete deposition of @xmath64  of @xmath2ni , confirming that the total mass of @xmath2ni  should be at least @xmath65 .",
    "in figure 3 we show the new extended light curve of sn  1997ef .",
    "the `` bolometric '' light curve was derived from the model fits , not from integrating the spectra .",
    "the bc changes from negative to positive on about day 60 , and the bolometric light curve is brighter and somewhat flatter than the @xmath31 light curve at advanced epochs . the bolometric light curve between 1998 mar . 7 and mar . 26 ( days 107126 ) is only slightly steeper than the @xmath2codecay slope .",
    "the luminosity for jan .",
    "26 ( day 67 ) is the result of modelling the photospheric spectrum only , and it does not include net emission which is present .",
    "its value is therefore somewhat underestimated .",
    "the late - time bolometric light curve of sn  1997ef appears to follow the decay rate of @xmath2co .",
    "if we assume that the deposition of the @xmath29-rays and positrons is complete ( @xmath66 ) in this late phase , a @xmath2ni  mass of @xmath50 is derived .",
    "however , this must be an underestimate , because @xmath67 of @xmath2ni  was required to explain the peak of the light curve , and the subsequent decline was faster than the @xmath2co  slope , so that @xmath68 , integrated over the entire ejecta , must be less than 1 in the late phase . in the combined photospheric and nebular models for sn  1997ef",
    ", we find @xmath69 in the nebula .",
    "if we take this value of @xmath68 to be representative of the entire sn , we require @xmath16(@xmath2ni)@xmath70 to fit the luminosity , which is certainly an overestimate , because there is still a photosphere in the march 1998 spectra .",
    "this suggests that @xmath16(@xmath2ni ) may be about @xmath71 , part of which is buried deep in the ejecta so that @xmath72 , and the rest is in the nebula where @xmath68 would change with radius or position in a more continuous manner .",
    "the presence of @xmath2ni  deep in the ejecta , which contributes only marginally to the peak of the light curve , may be in agreement with the observed presence of material at velocities below the cutoff required for the ejection of @xmath67 of @xmath2ni .",
    "however , this puzzling finding also suggests that the explosion may not be described accurately if simple spherical symmetry is adopted .",
    "the combination of the photospheric and nebular components in the advanced - phase spectra of sn  1997ef seems to require a value of the @xmath2nimass of at least @xmath65 , slightly larger than the estimate from the peak of the light curve .",
    "this value is subject to uncertainties because of the incomplete @xmath29-ray deposition . a more accurate determination of the @xmath2ni  mass may be possible by analyzing data from later epochs , when the sn should more closely approximate a nebula .",
    "unfortunately , the only spectrum of sn  1997ef which is sufficiently late is also very noisy , and only the [ o  i ] and ca  ii  lines can be detected",
    ". however , matheson et  al .  ( 2001 ) suggested that another sn  ic , sn  1997dq , is a close analogue of sn  1997ef , and there exist nebular spectra of this sn .",
    "matheson et  al .  ( 2001 ) showed a set of spectra of the peculiar sn  ic 1997dq and suggested that it is similar to sn  1997ef ( cf .",
    "their figures 17 and 18 ) . in figure 4",
    "we compare the normalized light curves of these two sne .",
    "the light curve of sn  1997dq ( nakano & aoki 1997 ; moretti & tomaselli 1997 , 1998a , b , c ) is shifted by 1.8 mag and the epoch is defined so that the two light curves overlap . these light curves seem to be very similar , suggesting that the properties of sn  1997dq were either the same as those of sn  1997ef or fell along the track of parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath12 ) which produce equivalent light curves .",
    "however , having assigned an epoch to the spectra of sn  1997dq on the basis of the light - curve comparison , its spectra can now be compared with those of sn  1997ef taken at a nominally similar epoch .",
    "this comparison ( figure 5 ) shows that the two sne also have very similar spectra . because the spectra ( line width and velocity ) also depend on @xmath14  and @xmath12 , but do so in a different way than does the light - curve shape , the fact that both the light curves and the spectra of the two sne are similar shows rather conclusively that they had comparable parameters . the only slight uncertainty may be in the mass of @xmath2ni , because this affects the overall brightness of the light curve , but not so much its shape .",
    "an independent determination of the mass of @xmath2ni  can , however , be obtained from the nebular spectrum .",
    "as we mentioned above , a nebular spectrum is available of sn  1997dq .",
    "this can be used to determine the mass of @xmath2ni  ejected by this sn and , by analogy , by sn  1997ef .",
    "the spectrum was obtained on 1998 june 18 ( matheson et  al .",
    "given the dating of the sn  1997dq light curve based on the comparison with the light curve of sn  1997ef , the epoch of this spectrum is 262 days after explosion .",
    "a small error in the determination of the epoch does not affect the results of the modelling .",
    "we modelled the 1998 june 18 spectrum with our nlte nebular code ( e.g. ,  mazzali et  al .",
    "2001 ) . given the relative distance modulus of sn  1997dq with respect to sn  1997ef ( @xmath73 mag ) , we adopted for sn  1997dq a distance modulus",
    "@xmath74 mag ( @xmath75 mpc ) .",
    "we assumed that no reddening is present , as for sn  1997ef .",
    "the best fit ( figure 6 ) required @xmath16(@xmath2ni ) @xmath76 , and a total mass of @xmath77 , of which only about @xmath78 consists of o , the rest being mostly si , c , and s. the masses of ca and mg are rather small by comparison , even though they do give rise to rather strong emission features . the nebula has an outer velocity of only @xmath79 km  s@xmath23 , which is similar to the velocity of the nebular component of the spectra of sn  1997ef .",
    "the fact that the velocities of the regions that form the nebular spectrum are low confirms the finding of mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) that significant amounts of mass are present at velocities lower than the cutoff imposed by 1-dimensional explosion models . indeed ,",
    "mazzali et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated that the mass between 3000 and 5000 km  s@xmath23  is @xmath80 , in good agreement with our result here , which refers to all regions with @xmath81 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the density of the outer regions , which contributed to the early spectra , is too low at these advanced epochs to contribute significantly to the nebular spectrum , and the deposition of @xmath29-rays and positrons is also probably quite small , because @xmath2ni  is not expected to be mostly located in those outer regions .",
    "the estimate of the @xmath2ni  mass is also in good agreement with the results obtained for sn  1997ef .",
    "although the spectrum is not of exceptionally good signal - to - noise ratio , the line profiles seem to show no signs of an asymmetric explosion , such as the double components , narrow and broad , observed in the nebular spectra of sn  1998bw ( mazzali et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the only available photometry of sn  1997dq are the unfiltered ccd points reported in several iaucs . since we do not know the exact response of the ccds that were used to observe sn  1997dq , the @xmath31-band fluxes derived from the unfiltered ccd fluxes to compare sn",
    "1997dq to sn  1997ef have an intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "ccd s typically have a response similar to that of the @xmath82-band ( see , e.g. , sec . 2 and fig .",
    "27 in matheson et al .",
    "the spectra of sn  1997dq show that its @xmath82 and @xmath31 magnitudes have a difference of @xmath83 mag .",
    "we take this as an estimate of the uncertainty of approximating the @xmath31 flux to the ccd flux . to account for this uncertainty",
    ", we also modelled the nebular spectrum using distance moduli of 32.33 and 31.33 mag .",
    "we can still obtain good fits of the nebular spectrum using the same outer velocity for the nebula , but the @xmath2ni  mass and the total ejecta mass increase to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , if the larger distance is used , and decrease to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , if the shorter distance is used .",
    "this range of values ( in particular the mass of @xmath2ni ) is consistent with the sn having produced more @xmath2ni  than the average sn  ic .",
    "the main discrepancies between the synthetic and observed spectra are the emission near 7750 , which is absent in the model , and the [ ca  ii ]  7291,7324 , which is too broad in the model .",
    "as for the first feature , it is tempting to attribute it to o  i  7775 . however , this line is very weak in our models , as it comes from rather highly excited upper levels .",
    "signs of a narrow ca  ii  ir triplet are also seen , and this could indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of ca . however , the 7291,7324  line is also affected by [ fe  ii ] emission ( @xmath88,7388 ) , which contributes to making the synthetic feature too broad . a three - dimensional study , or at least a one - dimensional stratified one , may be required to understand this behaviour .",
    "both problems , however , may simply be due to our still rather limited knowledge of fe - group lines collision strengths .    in conclusion",
    ", our simulations of the nebular spectrum of sn  1997dq confirm that this sn had very similar properties to sn  1997ef , and in particular that it ejected @xmath89 of @xmath2ni .",
    "the final points in the light curve of sn  1997ef are indeed brighter than the synthetic light curves , which were computed for @xmath90 ( mazzali et  al .",
    "using the advanced - phase spectra of sn  1997ef and one nebular spectrum of sn  1997dq we have shown that the two sne are very similar , so that sn  1997dq can also be dubbed a hypernova .",
    "we also found that the mass of @xmath2ni  ejected by both sne is @xmath1 , somewhat larger than the @xmath90 necessary to fit the early light curve .",
    "the fact that sn  1997ef retained a photospheric component to its spectrum up to at least day 126 suggests that even though the outer ejecta were expanding at high velocities , a significant fraction of the mass was ejected at very low velocities .",
    "this contradicts the results of 1-dimensional explosion calculations ( mazzali et  al .",
    "2000 ) , which produce ejecta with a well - defined lower velocity boundary , but is consistent with the finding by mazzali et  al .",

    "they find that the increased @xmath2ni  mass helps to reproduce the late - time light curve , but it does not affect the early - time light curve if it is contained in an inner region of low velocity and high density which is added to the original density structure .",
    "this inner region is also necessary to have the prolonged photospheric - type spectra .",
    "a possibility is that sn  1997ef , like other sn  1998bw - like sne  ic , was a highly aspherical explosion .",
    "two - dimensional calculations of jetted explosions show that the asphericity significantly alters the density and ni distributions , especially in the central region ( maeda et  al .",
    "2002 ; maeda & nomoto 2003 ) . signatures of asphericity , however , are not easy to detect , partly due to the paucity of detailed and direct theoretical predictions by multi - dimensional radiation calculations .",
    "if sn  1997ef was a highly aspherical explosion , it is likely that the sn was not viewed from very close to the jet axis , since the case for association with a grb is not strong .",
    "it is interesting that at least 2 objects out of the 28 sne  ib / ic discussed by matheson et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) are sn  1998bw - like sne  ic .",
    "sne  ib / c are thought to originate from the stripped co cores of massive stars ( e.g. ,  sn  1994i had a core mass @xmath93 and a main - sequence mass of @xmath94 ; iwamoto et  al .",
    "1994 ) . for sn  1997ef ,",
    "the zams mass was estimated to be @xmath9535@xmath19 .",
    "the least massive sn  1998bw - like sn  ic known to date is sn  2002ap , for which the zams mass was estimated at @xmath9625  @xmath19 . for a normal initial mass function , @xmath96% of all stars with @xmath97 have @xmath98 .",
    "podsiadlowski et  al .",

    ". it would be interesting to study the properties of a sample of sne  ib / ic to determine their kinetic energies and the amount of @xmath2ni  they synthesized , in order to verify whether they might populate the plots relating these quantities to the zams mass ( nomoto et  al .",

    "<S> the two peculiar type ic supernovae ( sne ) 1997ef and 1997dq are shown to have very similar photometric and spectral evolution in the epochs when both sne are observed ( i.e. ,  beyond @xmath0 days after the explosion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the early light curves and spectra of sn  1997ef suggested that this was a `` hypernova , '' or `` sn 1998bw - like type ic supernova . '' </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the two sne are very similar allows us to extend the time coverage of this type of event , since sn  1997dq , unlike sn  1997ef , was observed well into the nebular phase . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to sn  1998bw , the spectra of these two sne did not become fully nebular until almost one year after the explosion . during a long transition phase , lasting at least 6 months , the sne developed nebular emission in lines of [ o  i ] and [ ca  ii ] , but at the same time they retained an underlying , photospheric - type spectrum , originating at very low velocities . </S>",
    "<S> spectral synthesis techniques are used to model the spectrum of sn 1997dq , suggesting that it produced @xmath1 of @xmath2ni , and that a significant fraction of this is located in a dense , low - velocity inner region . </S>"
