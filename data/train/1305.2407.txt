    "an outstanding feature of diffractive photoproduction of mesons at the high energy regime is the possibility to investigate the pomeron exchange .",
    "in such an energy domain hadrons and photons can be considered as color dipoles in the mixed light cone representation @xcite . in particular , their transverse sizes are to be considered frozen during the interaction . then , the scattering process is characterized by the color dipole cross section representing the interaction of those color dipoles with the target ( protons or nuclei ) . the color evolution of the dipole cross section at small bjorken-@xmath2 is given by the solution of a non - linear evolution equation .",
    "it is known for a long time that dipole sizes of magnitude @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the vector meson mass ) are probed by the @xmath5 vector meson production amplitude @xcite . as far as heavy quarks are concerned",
    ", the sufficiently large mass of quarkonium states makes the amplitude to be perturbatively calculable even at photoproduction region @xmath6 .",
    "the diffractive production of the @xmath7 radially excited vector mesons , like @xmath0 and @xmath8 , is specially interesting due to the node effect @xcite .",
    "it means a strong cancellation of dipole size contributions to the production amplitude from the region above and below the node position in the @xmath7 radial wavefunction @xcite .",
    "this is the origin of the large suppression of the photoproduction of radially excited vector mesons @xmath7 versus @xmath5 .",
    "it is an experimental fact that the ratio @xmath9 at desy - hera energies at @xmath10 and the ratio is a @xmath11-dependent quantity as the electroproduction cross sections are considered @xcite .",
    "the question has risen intense debate a long time ago @xcite and it was found for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite that the combination of the energy dependence of the dipole cross section and the node of the radial wavefunction of @xmath7 states leads to an anomalous @xmath11 and energy dependence of diffractive production of @xmath7 vector mesons .",
    "in addition , such anomaly appears also in the @xmath12-dependence of the differential cross section of radially excited @xmath7 light vector mesons @xcite , which is in contradiction with the usual monotonical behavior of corresponding @xmath5 states .    here",
    ", we focus on the photoproduction of radially excited vector mesons off nuclei in heavy ion relativistic collisions . in particular , we analyze the exclusive photoproduction of @xmath13 off nuclei , @xmath14 , where for coherent scattering one has @xmath15 whereas for incoherent case @xmath16 with @xmath17 being an excited state of the @xmath18-nucleon system . the theoretical framework used in the present work",
    "is the light - cone dipole formalism . in such framework",
    ", the @xmath19 fluctuation of the incoming quasi - real photon interacts with the nucleus target via the dipole cross section and the result is projected on the wavefunction of the observed hadron . in the energy regime",
    "we are interested , the dipole cross section depends on the gluon distribution in the target and nuclear shadowing of the gluon distribution is expected to reduce it compared to a proton target .",
    "moreover , theoretically at high energies one expects the transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics , where only the parton emissions are considered , to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important in the parton cascade and the evolution is given by a nonlinear evolution equation ( for recent reviews on the topic see ref .",
    "this regime is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction , the so - called parton saturation .",
    "the transition is specified by a typical scale , the so called saturation scale @xmath20 @xcite , which is energy dependent .",
    "recently , the alice collaboration has measured the diffractive @xmath1 vector meson production at a relatively large rapidity @xmath21 @xcite and central rapidities @xcite as well in the @xmath22 tev run , which opens the possibility of investigating small-@xmath2 physics with heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition , the incoherent @xmath23 cross section has been also measured @xcite .",
    "this is interesting , as the saturation is enhanced for nuclear targets , i.e. @xmath24 . the lhcb collaboration has also measured the cross section in proton - proton collisions at @xmath25 tev of exclusive dimuon final states , including the @xmath26 state @xcite .",
    "the ratio at forward rapidity @xmath27 in that case is @xmath28 , which is still consistent to the color dipole approach formalism .",
    "therefore , an investigation on the @xmath0 photoproduction in pbpb collisions at the lhc is interesting by itself and timely .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we present a brief review of the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons in electromagnetic reactions in nucleus - nucleus collisions focusing on the pbpb reactions at the lhc energy regime . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we show our predictions for the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section including the coherent and incoherent contributions .",
    "we also check the compatibility with the recent measurements of the @xmath23 state @xcite .",
    "moreover , we compare the current results to related approaches available in the literature . finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is dominant in the nucleus - nucleus interaction at large impact parameter and at ultra relativistic energies . in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , which can interact with each other .",
    "accordingly , the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section @xcite . in what follows",
    "our main focus shall be in photon - hadron processes which is relevant for the photoproduction of radially excited vector mesons .",
    "considering the requirement that photoproduction is not accompanied by hadronic interaction an analytic expression for the equivalent photon flux of a nuclei can be calculated @xcite @xmath29 . \\label{fluxint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the photon energy , @xmath31 is the lorentz boost of a single beam and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the modified bessel functions . considering symmetric nuclei having radius @xmath34 , one has @xmath35 .",
    "the cross section for the photoproduction of @xmath13 off nuclei in heavy ion relativistic collisions is given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the differential cross section for the process @xmath38",
    ", @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the c.m.s energy of the nucleus - nucleus system .",
    "since photon emission is coherent over the entire nucleus and the photon is colorless we expect that the events to be characterized by @xmath42 and two rapidity gaps in the case of coherent process . in the incoherent process , @xmath16 ( excited nucleus state ) as already mentioned .",
    "the rapidity distribution @xmath43 for quarkonium photoproduction in nucleus - nucleus collisions can be also computed directly from eq .",
    "( [ sigaa ] ) , by using its relation with the photon energy @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "explicitly , the rapidity distribution is written down as , @xmath45}{dy } = \\omega \\frac{dn_{\\gamma } ( \\omega ) } { d\\omega } \\,\\sigma_{\\gamma a \\rightarrow \\psi(2s ) x } \\left(\\omega \\right ) , \\label{dsigdy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 represents the presence of a rapidity gap .",
    "consequently , given the photon flux , the rapidity distribution is thus a direct measure of the photoproduction cross section for a given energy .",
    "let us consider photon - nucleus scattering in the light - cone dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath47 long after the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron @xcite . in the dipole picture",
    "the amplitude for vector meson production off nucleons reads as ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the light - cone wavefunctions of the photon and of the vector meson , respectively .",
    "the quark and antiquark helicities are labeled by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , variable @xmath47 defines the relative transverse separation of the pair ( dipole ) , @xmath53 @xmath54 is the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 denotes the transverse momentum lost by the outgoing proton ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath2 is the bjorken variable .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 is the elementary amplitude for the scattering of a dipole of size @xmath47 on the target . in a compact notation ,",
    "the non - forward amplitude and the differential cross section for exclusive production of charmonia ( or other final state ) off a nucleon target , respectively , are given by , @xmath58    in the numerical calculation shown in next section , the corrections due to skewedness effect ( off - diagonal gluon exchange ) and real part of amplitude are also taken into account .",

    "@xcite .    at this point",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , we are using a particular choice for the meson wavefunctions , eqs .",
    "[ eq : wf1s ] and [ eq : wf2s ] .",
    "the boosted gaussian wavefunction considered here is a simplification of the nnpz wavefunction presented in refs .",
    "it has been compared to recent analysis of desy - hera data for vector meson exclusive processes .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the boosted gaussian wavefunction was successfully compared to the light mesons and @xmath69 production data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the production of @xmath70 and its excited states ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) was investigated and very good agreement with desy - hera data was found .",
    "another point to be analyzed is the role played by the node effect to describe the measured ratio @xmath73 in the photoproduction case .",
    "such a ratio is sensitive to the time - scale of the production process . in the dipole approach",
    "the interactions occur during the period where the color dipole is compact having a transverse size @xmath74 and the production cross section is proportional to the square of the quarkonium wavefunction at origin , @xmath75 . on the other hand , further interactions depend on the wavefunction profile for transverse sizes larger than @xmath76 , the so - called bohr radius . in exclusive charmonia electroproduction at relatively large @xmath11",
    "the dipole size is of order @xmath77 and the cross section is predicted to be proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "this leads the ratio to be of order @xmath79 at large @xmath11 whereas the measured value in photoproduction is around 0.16 @xcite .",
    "it has been determined long time ago in refs .",
    "@xcite that the moderate value of charm mass and the dominant color transparency behavior of dipole cross section @xmath80 imply the amplitude to probe the meson wavefunction at a transverse size around @xmath81 .",
    "this fact reduces the @xmath26 contribution due to the node in its wavefunction and correctly describes the measured desy - hera ratio . along these lines",
    ", it was explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the at @xmath6 the leading logarithmic approximation @xmath82 , which gives the usual @xmath80 , is not able to provide alone the correct value for the ratio @xmath83 . here , @xmath84 is the exchanged gluon transverse momentum in a two - gluon exchange model .",
    "therefore , important contributions come from the overlap of the large - sized color dipole configurations and the @xmath26 wavefunction . thus , despite the leading logarithmic approximation to be able to describe the @xmath69 production cross section the same is not true for the excited states as the @xmath13 .",
    "this is the reason why we will use a model for the dipole cross section that takes into account the correct behavior for large dipole configurations ( the transition hard - soft is given by the saturation scale ) .",
    "the exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction off nuclei for coherent and incoherent processes can be simply computed in high energies where the large coherence length @xmath85 is fairly valid . in such case",

    "in addition , we allow for its renormalization by the effect of gluon shadowing phenomenon as the gluon density in nuclei at small-@xmath2 region is known to be suppressed compared to a free nucleon . that is , we will take @xmath100 following studies in ref .",
    "the factor @xmath101 is the nuclear gluon density ratio . in the present investigation",
    "we will use the nuclear ratio from the leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing based on generalization of the gribov - glauber multiple scattering formalism as investigated in ref .",

    "it overestimates the alice data on the backward ( forward ) and mainly in central rapidities . in the backward / forward rapidity case",
    ", the overestimation is already expected as a proper threshold factor for @xmath104 was not included in the present calculation . in that kinematical region",

    "in such a case , considering @xmath103 the alice data @xcite is overestimate by a factor 2 or so , as already noticed in recent study of ref .",
    "the situation is improved if we consider nuclear shadowing renormalising the dipole cross section .",
    "the reason is that the gluon density in nuclei at small bjorken @xmath2 is expected to be suppressed compared to a free nucleon due to interferences . for the ratio of the gluon density , @xmath110",
    ", we have considered the theoretical evaluation of ref .",
    "there , two scenarios for the gluon shadowing are investigated : model 1 corresponds to a strong gluon shadowing and model 2 concerns to small nuclear shadowing .",
    "the consequence of renormalizing the dipole cross section by gluon shadowing effects is represented by the long - dashed ( model 1 ) and solid ( model 2 ) lines , respectively . clearly , the small shadowing option is preferred in the current analysis .",
    "it is worth to mention that the theoretical uncertainty related to the choice of meson wavefunction is relatively large . as a prediction at central rapidity , one obtains @xmath111 and @xmath112 mb for calculation using @xmath103 , model 1 and model 2 , respectively . here",
    ", a word of caution is needed as we are considering @xmath101 as independent on the impact parameter .",
