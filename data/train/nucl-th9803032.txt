    "the @xmath0mn nuclei were in fact detected in cosmic rays using the ulysses spacecraft  @xcite .",
    "they offer an attractive possibility to use their measured abundance as a chronometer for the iron group nuclei ( sc - ni ) in cosmic rays in analogy to the chronometers based on the abundances of other long lived isotopes ( @xmath8be , @xmath10al , and @xmath12cl ) . with them",
    "one can , in turn , determine the mean density of interstellar matter , a quantity of considerable interest .",
    "the use of the long lived nuclei as cosmic ray chronometers is reviewed in ref .",

    "[ fig : decay ] ; the dashed lines indicate the decay paths of the stripped @xmath0mn .    in two recent difficult and elegant experiments the very small branching ratio for the @xmath2 decay to the ground state of @xmath0cr has been measured : @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite . by taking the weighed mean of these values",
    "we extract the averaged branching ratio of @xmath16 . combining it with the known halflife for @xmath0mn of 312.3(4 )  d  @xcite",

    "we will use the state of the art shell model and evaluate not only the @xmath19 decay rate of the normal @xmath0mn , but also both decay branches of the unique second forbidden transitions @xmath0mn@xmath20cr@xmath21 and @xmath0mn@xmath20fe@xmath21 . by comparing the calculated @xmath2 decay halflife ( or branching ratio ) to the measured one we hope to judge the reliability of the calculation .",

    "first , we consider harmonic oscillator wave functions . in this case",
    "all matrix elements are proportional to the square of the length parameter @xmath75 .",
    "we use the prescription of reference  @xcite to determine @xmath75 from the experimental charge radius @xmath76  @xcite of the parent nucleus ; this leads to @xmath77  fm in @xmath0mn .",

    "these transitions were previously computed in ref .",
    "@xcite using a truncated shell - model calculation . in our case , without truncating the @xmath7 shell space , we use the wildenthal usd effective interaction  @xcite and determine the radial parameters following the procedure outlined in the previous paragraph . in the harmonic oscillator approximation we use @xmath82  fm for @xmath9na and @xmath83  fm for @xmath10al .",

    "our calculation suggests that the form factor for the @xmath1 decay , 11.7  @xmath66 , is larger than the form factor for the @xmath2 decay , 7.8  @xmath66 .",
    "we can offer some intuitive , albeit very crude , understanding of this difference .",
    "let us treat the three nuclei in the extreme single particle model .",
    "also , instead of the actual transitions connecting the odd - odd nucleus @xmath0mn with the corresponding even - even ground state , let us consider the transitions from the seniority zero even - even nuclei to the odd - odd one .",
    "the cr @xmath85 mn transition would then involve @xmath88 @xmath89 , changing a @xmath54 neutron into a @xmath52 proton .",
    "in contrast , the fe @xmath85 mn would involve @xmath90 , changing a @xmath52 proton into a @xmath54 neutron . using the above naive assignments , we are led to the conclusion that the @xmath1 form factor should be about @xmath91 times larger than the @xmath2 form factor . even though the detailed shell model results are not fully determined by the indicated single particle transitions ( but they are the largest ones ) , the overall scaling factor emerges .    among the @xmath7 shell transitions in table  [ tab : results ]",
    ", the transition to the 1.8  mev state in @xmath10 mg agrees perfectly with the experiment , while the calculated form factors for the other two are somewhat larger , by a factor of about 1.5 , than the experimental value . for @xmath8be decay",

    "we can not , therefore , draw any conclusion about the necessity of quenching in the case of the unique second forbidden transitions .",
    "while the lighter @xmath6 and @xmath7 shell nuclei contain perhaps a hint that quenching is needed , it would obviously spoil the agreement in the case of the @xmath2 branch of the @xmath0mn decay .    in conclusion :",
