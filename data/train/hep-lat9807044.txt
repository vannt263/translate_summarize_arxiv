    "monte carlo simulations of lattice qcd have evolved from spectrum calculations to more detailed investigations of hadron structure .",
    "these more advanced studies require to calculate hadronic matrix elements of composite operators . in order to compute the moments of hadronic structure functions , for example",
    ", one needs the matrix elements of composite operators appearing in the operator product expansion of the appropriate currents @xcite . in general",
    ", one has to renormalise these operators in order to obtain finite answers in the continuum limit .",
    "furthermore , comparison with the results of phenomenological analyses usually requires the matrix elements to be given in one of the popular continuum renormalisation schemes , e.g.  the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "so one has to think about the conversion of the bare lattice operators to renormalised continuum operators .",
    "consider the special case of the operators determining the moments of hadronic structure functions . here",
    "the renormalised continuum matrix element has to be multiplied by the corresponding wilson coefficient to yield the desired moment , which can be measured in deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "being an observable quantity it must be independent of any choices made in the renormalisation procedure .",
    "this is of course only possible , if the renormalised matrix element and the wilson coefficient are calculated in the same scheme . in particular",
    ", the dependence on the renormalisation scale @xmath1 has to cancel between the renormalisation constant and the wilson coefficient .",
    "since the wilson coefficients are usually computed in the @xmath0 scheme , we have to convert our lattice operators to continuum @xmath0 operators if we want to make contact with phenomenology .    one obvious possibility to calculate",
    "the necessary renormalisation factors is lattice perturbation theory . however , quite often lattice perturbation theory seems to converge rather slowly . identifying one source of these poor convergence properties , lepage and mackenzie proposed as a remedy the so - called tadpole improved perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "still , lattice perturbation series rarely extend beyond the one - loop level , and hence considerable uncertainty remains .",
    "it is therefore only natural to try a nonperturbative renormalisation by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "a way how to do this was introduced in ref .",
    "we shall present several improvements of this method and apply it to a variety of operators that are bilinear in the quark fields  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we study operators which are needed to calculate hadronic structure functions . computing the @xmath2 factors for a rather large range of renormalisation scales",
    "we can find out at which scales ( if at all ) perturbative behaviour sets in such that the multiplication with the perturbative wilson coefficients makes sense .    in this paper we shall work only with wilson fermions in the quenched approximation .",
    "however , an obvious next step is the use of improved fermions in order to reduce cut - off effects . like the renormalisation of our operators",
    ", the improvement should be nonperturbative .",
    "as far as the action is concerned , there is already a lot of experience how to achieve this .",
    "but improvement of the action is not sufficient , the operators have to be improved as well . here",
    "a good deal of work still has to be done , in particular for operators containing derivatives .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : after introducing in section  [ sec.operators ] the operators to be studied we explain the method of nonperturbative renormalisation in section  [ sec.method ] . in the special case of the vector and axial vector currents we prefer a variant of this method because it seems to suppress lattice artifacts more efficiently .",
    "we describe it in section  [ sec.vector ] .",
    "perturbative formulae , which we need for comparison and for obtaining results in the @xmath0 scheme , are given in section  [ sec.pert ] .",
    "section  [ sec.numerics ] contains some details of the numerical implementation including our momentum sources which greatly reduce the statistical noise of the data . in section  [ sec.results ]",
    "we present and discuss our results .",
    "finally , we come to our conclusions .",
    "in the euclidean continuum we should study the operators @xmath3{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_2}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } q \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath4{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_1}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } q\\ ] ] or rather o(4 ) irreducible multiplets with definite c - parity . in particular",
    ", we obtain twist-2 operators by symmetrising the indices and subtracting the traces . in the flavour - nonsinglet case they do not mix and are hence multiplicatively renormalisable .    working with wilson fermions",
    "it is straightforward to write down lattice versions of the above operators .",
    "one simply replaces the continuum covariant derivative by its lattice analogue .",
    "however , o(4 ) being restricted to its finite subgroup h(4 ) ( the hypercubic group ) on the lattice , the constraints imposed by space - time symmetry are less stringent than in the continuum and the possibilities for mixing increase @xcite . guided by the h(4 ) classification given in ref .",
    "@xcite we have chosen the operators @xcite @xmath5 they are labeled by the reduced hadron matrix elements which they determine .",
    "in addition , we have studied the following operators without derivatives ( `` currents '' ) : @xmath6 where all quark fields are taken at the same lattice point , as well as the conserved vector current @xmath7 with the link matrix @xmath8 su(3 ) representing the gauge field .",
    "note that the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 although belonging to the same irreducible o(4 ) multiplet transform according to inequivalent representations of h(4 ) .",
    "hence their renormalisation factors calculated on the lattice have no reason to coincide .",
    "the same remark applies to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the operators @xmath13 and @xmath11 , on the other hand , are members of the same irreducible h(4 ) multiplet , hence their renormalisation factors should agree also on the lattice .    concerning the mixing properties a few remarks are in order . mixing with operators of equal or lower dimension",
    "is excluded for the operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , as well as for the currents .",
    "the case of the operator @xmath15 , for which there are two further operators with the same dimension and the same transformation behaviour , is discussed in refs .",
    "the operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , on the other hand , could in principle mix not only with operators of the same dimension but also with an operator of one dimension less and different chiral properties .",
    "it is of the type @xmath18{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_1}$ } } { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_2}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } q \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 in the case of @xmath16 and @xmath20 for @xmath17 .",
    "our analysis ignores mixing completely .",
    "this seems to be justified for @xmath15 . here",
    "a perturbative calculation gives a rather small mixing coefficient for one of the mixing operators @xcite , whereas the other candidate for mixing does not appear at all in a one - loop calculation of quark matrix elements at momentum transfer zero , because its born term vanishes in forward direction .",
    "the same is true for all operators of dimension less or equal to 6 which transform identically to @xmath16 : their born term vanishes in forward matrix elements , hence they do not show up in a one - loop calculation at vanishing momentum transfer . in the case of @xmath17 , however , the mixing with an operator of lower dimension is already visible at the one - loop level even in forward direction .",
    "our calculation of renormalisation constants follows closely the procedure proposed by martinelli et al .",
    "it mimics the definitions used in ( continuum ) perturbation theory .",
    "we work on a lattice of spacing @xmath21 and volume @xmath22 in euclidean space . for a fixed gauge",
    "let @xmath23 denote the non - amputated quark - quark green function with one insertion of the operator @xmath24 at momentum zero .",
    "it is to be considered as a matrix in colour and dirac space . with the quark propagator",
    "@xmath25 the corresponding vertex function ( or amputated green function ) is given by @xmath26 defining the renormalised vertex function by @xmath27 we fix the renormalisation constant @xmath28 by imposing the renormalisation condition @xmath29 at @xmath30 , where @xmath1 is the renormalisation scale .",
    "so we calculate @xmath28 from @xmath31 with @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the born term in the vertex function of @xmath24 computed on the lattice , and @xmath33 denotes the quark field renormalisation constant .",
    "the latter can be taken as @xmath34 again at @xmath30 .    if the operator under study belongs to an o(4 )",
    "multiplet of dimension greater than 1 , i.e.  if it carries at least one space - time index , the trace in eq .",
    "( [ calcz ] ) will in general depend on the direction of @xmath35 .",
    "so the renormalisation condition ( [ defz ] ) violates o(4 ) covariance even in the continuum limit . in the continuum , this disease is easily cured by a suitable summation over the members of the o(4 ) multiplet . on the lattice , this makes sense only in the few special cases where the o(4 ) multiplet is irreducible also under the hypercubic group h(4 ) , because the renormalisation constants for the different h(4 ) multiplets within a given o(4 ) multiplet will in general be different .",
    "so we have to live with this noncovariance , which , of course , should finally be compensated when we convert our results to a covariant renormalisation scheme .",
    "the scale @xmath1 at which our renormalisation constants are defined should ideally satisfy the conditions @xmath36 on a lattice with linear extent @xmath37 .",
    "whether in a concrete calculation these conditions may be considered as fulfilled remains to be seen .",
    "in the special case of the vector and axial vector currents in the continuum we can distinguish between longitudinal and transverse components with respect to the momentum .",
    "one may thus define two renormalisation constants , one from the longitudinal and one from the transverse components . denoting the vertex function of the currents generically by @xmath38 we have for the vector current ( the modifications required in the case of the axial vector current are obvious ) @xmath39 @xmath40 note that these renormalisation conditions are o(4 ) covariant .",
    "we try to generalise ( [ transvcon ] ) to the lattice imposing a renormalisation condition of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a suitable dirac matrix and @xmath43 denotes the born term evaluated on the lattice . in the case of the conserved vector current we know that @xmath44 , hence we can calculate @xmath33 from ( [ transv ] ) .",
    "this value is then used to determine @xmath45 for the local vector and axial vector currents .",
    "the matrix @xmath42 is constructed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 the normalisation factor @xmath48 follows immediately from the condition ( [ transv ] ) : @xmath49 \\,.\\ ] ] note that for @xmath50 and @xmath51 we have @xmath52 , and ( [ transv ] ) reduces to ( [ transvcon ] ) in the continuum limit .    in the case of the conserved vector current",
    "we find @xmath53 so that @xmath54 for the local vector and axial vector current we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively , and we obtain in both cases @xmath57 working with the longitudinal component , i.e.  with a lattice version of ( [ longcon ] ) , leads to a less smooth momentum dependence , i.e.  to stronger lattice effects .",
    "( [ defz ] ) defines a renormalisation scheme of the momentum subtraction type , which we call mom scheme .",
    "note that it will in general not agree with any of the momentum subtraction schemes used in continuum perturbation theory .",
    "it is desirable to convert our results into a more popular scheme like the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "moreover , we want to use our renormalisation factors in connection with the wilson coefficients , which appear in the operator product expansion , and these are generally given in the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "hence we have to perform a finite renormalisation leading us from the renormalisation scheme defined by eq .",
    "( [ defz ] ) to the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "the corresponding renormalisation constant @xmath58 is computed in continuum perturbation theory using dimensional regularisation .",
    "we work in a general covariant gauge ( gauge parameter @xmath59 ) such that the gluon propagator has the form @xmath60 the landau gauge , which is employed in our numerical simulations , corresponds to @xmath61 .",

    "for the renormalisation factor which brings us from the bare lattice operator to the renormalised operator in the @xmath0 scheme , lattice perturbation theory yields results of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a finite constant and @xmath79 is the one - loop coefficient of the anomalous dimension . working with an anticommuting @xmath65 also in the continuum part of the calculation we arrive at the values given in table  [ tab.finco ] ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    ".finite contributions to the renormalisation factors in lattice perturbation theory .",

[ cols=\"^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in tables  [ tab.zmom.avps ] - [ tab.zmom.a2r2r3 ] we present our results for @xmath80 in the mom scheme at selected values of the renormalisation scale .",
    "it is to be expected that the systematic uncertainties ( in particular cut - off effects ) are considerably larger than the quoted statistical errors . a reasonable measure for the size of the cut - off effects might be the width of the band of data points which is typically of the order of a few percent for not too small values of @xmath81 .",
    "in table  [ tab.zmsbar ] we give the nonperturbative values for @xmath82 in the @xmath0 scheme together with @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 . in order to determine the nonperturbative @xmath82 s for this value of @xmath81 we have interpolated linearly in @xmath86 between the two neighbouring results .",
    "the given error is the larger of the two statistical errors . disregarding the results at other values of @xmath81 we see that , with the exception of the operators containing one covariant derivative , tadpole improvement works in the right direction . in the case of the local vector and axial",
    "vector currents it even overshoots somewhat",
    ". however , only in these latter cases the improvement is quantitatively satisfactory .",
    "the renormalisation factors for the operators without derivatives ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) have been calculated with similar nonperturbative methods by other groups , too .",
    "however , most of these studies use either an improved fermionic action or work at different values of @xmath91 so that a direct comparison is impossible .",
    "we are aware of only one other paper dealing with wilson fermions at @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "let us compare our results as given in table  [ tab.zmom.avps ] with table  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    * in the case of the local vector and axial vector currents we find some discrepancies , which , however , decrease with increasing @xmath81 . at @xmath93 we obtain consistent results for the larger values of @xmath81 .",
    "the deviations could be due to the fact that we use only the transverse components of the currents .",
    "indeed , averaging over the four @xmath2 s determined from the four components of the local vector current by the method of section  [ sec.method ] , we arrive at fig .",
    "[ fig.zgim.vln ] , where also the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown .",
    "we observe satisfactory agreement as well as a relatively large spread of the data , which is not present in our method based on the transverse components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.z2beta.vlh ] ) . *",
    "the pseudoscalar density shows a different behaviour .",
    "our @xmath2 s are consistently smaller for @xmath92 , but always larger for @xmath93 ( although the differences are not large ) . here",
    "the chiral extrapolation might be responsible for the discrepancies .",
    "especially for the lower values of @xmath94 we observe deviations from a linear @xmath95 dependence , which make the extrapolation somewhat questionable and ambiguous .",
    "* for the scalar density we find satisfactory agreement if @xmath94 is not too small .",
    "like in our data , the ratio @xmath96 does not become constant even for the largest values of @xmath81 considered in @xcite .",
    "in all cases one should keep in mind that the lattice used in @xcite at @xmath93 is smaller than ours .",
    "furthermore , the momenta may differ in direction even if they are close in length , hence part of the differences could also be lattice artifacts .",
    "the renormalisation constant of the local vector current can also be computed from its correlation functions with hadron sources by comparing with the corresponding correlation functions of the conserved vector current , whose renormalisation constant is known to be one . a collection of results obtained with various versions of this method at @xmath92 is given by sachrajda @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) , albeit without extrapolation to the chiral limit .",
    "since the quark mass dependence is rather mild , we may nevertheless compare with our numbers as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.z2beta.vlh ] .",
    "the values given in ref .",
    "@xcite cluster around 0.73 ( computed from three - point functions ) and 0.57 ( computed from two - point functions ) .",
    "sachrajda attributes this large difference to discretization effects .",
    "this is in accordance with our interpretation of the strong scale dependence of the @xmath2 for the local vector current ( see subsection  [ subsec.veccur ] ) .",
    "more recently , the jlqcd collaboration has applied this method with wilson fermions at @xmath97 , 6.1 , and 6.3 @xcite .",
    "interpolating their results @xcite one finds 0.57 at @xmath98 and 0.62 at @xmath99 .",
    "the renormalisation of the local vector current and the axial vector current can also be studied by means of the ward identity method @xcite .",
    "however , the values obtained for wilson fermions at @xmath92 by maiani and martinelli @xcite ( 0.79(4 ) for the vector current and 0.85(7 ) for the axial vector current ) refer to point - split lattice currents and are therefore not immediately comparable with our numbers . on the other hand , for the ratio @xmath100 of the renormalisation constants of the local currents they give the values 0.85(5 ) and 0.79(5 ) which are lower than ( though not completely incompatible with )",
    "our result of 0.87 obtained at @xmath101 . from the @xmath2",
    "s which the jlqcd collaboration has calculated for the axial vector current by the ward identity method at @xmath97 , 6.1 , and 6.3 one gets by interpolation @xcite approximately 0.75 ( @xmath98 ) and 0.77 ( @xmath99 ) , which is somewhat lower than our values for @xmath101",
    ".    there have been various proposals to increase the accuracy in the determination of renormalisation constants , in particular by using modified versions of tadpole improvement . for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and the ratio @xmath96 these",
    "are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where also a comparison with results from the ward identity method is given .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of nonperturbative renormalisation for various operators in the framework of lattice qcd . in particular , twist-2 operators appearing in unpolarised ( polarised ) deep - inelastic scattering have been studied for all spins @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we worked with standard wilson fermions at two different lattice spacings . due to the use of momentum sources we achieved a high statistical accuracy so that systematic uncertainties ( cut - off effects , in particular ) are clearly visible . in order to make contact with perturbation theory one would like to identify scaling windows where the renormalisation scale @xmath1 is large enough to make perturbation theory trustworthy but small enough to allow to neglect cut - off effects . in this respect",
    "some operators did not follow our ( naive ) expectations . whereas the axial vector current and the scalar density behave",
    "as expected , the local vector current and the pseudoscalar density do not show perturbative scaling . a second thought",
    ", however , revealed that there might be good reasons for this behaviour related to the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry and there is nothing fundamentally wrong .    on the other hand ,",
    "the operators containing one or more covariant derivatives seem to approach perturbative scaling only for rather large values of the renormalisation scale where cut - off effects might influence the results .",
    "can we understand these deviations from perturbative scaling which seem to persist up to @xmath106gev@xmath107 ?",
    "if the observed scaling with @xmath91 is not only an artifact of our two @xmath91 values being relatively close to each other , the deviations from scaling in @xmath1 should be interpreted as real physics , though in a finite volume .",
    "( recall that our lattices at the two @xmath91 values have roughly the same physical size . )",
    "so one possibility would be finite - size effects , although the experience with other observables suggests that they should be small .",
    "but genuinely nonperturbative effects can not be ruled out , and one might also think of renormalons . in any case , one does not feel very comfortable when combining these nonperturbative @xmath2 s with perturbative wilson coefficients using a scale of , say , @xmath108gev@xmath107 .",
    "one remedy would be a nonperturbative calculation of the wilson coefficients .",
    "but one can also try to reach larger values of @xmath81 . in order to avoid strong cut - off effects one",
    "would then have to work at smaller lattice spacings , i.e.  at @xmath109 .",
    "however , this raises a new problem . at present",
    ", we have been careful to work with lattice sizes @xmath37 large enough that we believe finite - size effects are not serious .",
    "but if we try to reach much smaller @xmath21 s it soon becomes impossibly expensive to keep the physical lattice size sufficiently large .",
    "so we need a reliable method of measuring @xmath2 nonperturbatively , even when finite - size effects are not negligible .",
    "such a scheme has been suggested in ref .",
    "the key point is to note that although the green functions depend on @xmath37 , the renormalisation constants do not .",
    "this means that we can nonperturbatively measure the ratios of @xmath2 s at different lattice spacings by looking at the ratios of the corresponding bare green functions , both measured on lattices of the same physical size , and with bare masses chosen so that the renormalised mass is the same in both cases .",
    "note that to apply this scheme , we need good knowledge of the lattice spacing as a function of @xmath91 , which may be a problem .",
    "further improvement could come from continuum perturbation theory . in the case of the scalar density",
    "the use of the two - loop formula for @xmath70 and of the three - loop anomalous dimension improves the ( approximate ) scale independence of @xmath110 . for the operators with derivatives we only have the two - loop anomalous dimension and a one - loop calculation of @xmath70 .",
    "recently , however , first steps towards a three - loop computation of the anomalous dimension have been undertaken @xcite . from the results already obtained , a two - loop expression for @xmath70",
    "can be extracted , unfortunately only in the feynman gauge , whereas we would need the landau gauge .",
    "this work is supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and by bmbf .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the quadrics computers at desy - zeuthen .",
