    "it is generally accepted that the higgs sector of the standard model is trivial .",
    "a quantum field theory is defined by a set of bare parameters and a regulator with some cut - off @xmath2 .",
    "renormalized quantities are calculated in terms of the bare parameters , then the cut - off is sent to infinity . in a trivial theory ,",
    "the renormalized couplings vanish as @xmath3 for any choice of bare parameters . to have a non - trivial interacting theory , the cut - off must remain finite .",
    "hence , the higgs sector is an effective theory which is only valid at energy scales below the cut - off @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig : pdg_higgs ] shows the current phenomenological upper and lower bounds for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 , the threshold of new physics @xcite . for a given cut - off , the upper bound is the largest @xmath0 that can be generated by any choice of bare parameters .",
    "lattice simulations without top dynamics have found that @xmath4 when the bare higgs coupling @xmath5 and the momentum cut - off @xmath6 is a few tev @xcite , where @xmath7 is the lattice spacing .",
    "for the cut - off effects to be acceptably small , we require the correlation length @xmath8 so that e.g.  violation of rotational symmetry in particle scattering is less than a few % @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological lower bound for @xmath0 is based on the belief that , for a given top quark mass , the higgs mass can not be too small , otherwise the higgs field effective potential @xmath9 is unstable .",
    "the one - loop contributions to the renormalized effective potential from higgs and top loops are of the form @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , where @xmath12 is the renormalized vacuum expectation value of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the renormalized higgs and yukawa couplings . if @xmath16 , the negative top contribution dominates , @xmath17 as @xmath18 and the potential no longer has its absolute minimum at @xmath12 . for a given @xmath0 and @xmath19 ( i.e.  @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , renormalized perturbation theory is valid only if the vacuum is stable , defining an energy scale @xmath2 where new physics must occur .",
    "the state - of - the - art calculation of the lower bound from vacuum instability gives @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with an uncertainty of less than @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "as the current experimental limit is @xmath24 , this is a very relevant and important statement for the validity of the standard model .",
    "however , we claim that there is no vacuum instability in the theory , making the validity of the current lower bound uncertain .",
    "it was first shown in @xcite how to measure the constraint effective potential @xmath25 non - perturbatively via lattice simulations .",
    "in particular , we examine a model of a single component real scalar field coupled to two copies of staggered fermions , corresponding to 8 degenerate continuum fermion flavors .",
    "the bare parameters are the higgs mass @xmath26 and the higgs and yukawa couplings @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the scalar field is coupled locally to the fermions .",
    "we use the leapfrog hybrid monte carlo algorithm with step - size @xmath29 and trajectory length @xmath30 .",
    "our statistics are @xmath31 trajectories , with a separate simulation required at every value of the scalar field to measure @xmath25 .",
    "further details will be presented in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : potential ] shows results for the derivative of the constraint effective potential @xmath32 for a particular choice of bare parameters with @xmath33 .",
    "there is no sign of any instability at large values of the scalar field .",
    "one - loop bare perturbation theory is in excellent agreement with the non - perturbative simulations , and when @xmath34 is large , even tree - level perturbation theory is very close to the full result .",
    "renormalized perturbation theory also agrees with the non - perturbative determination of @xmath25 when @xmath34 is small .",
    "however , when @xmath34 is large , the renormalization method breaks down because the cut - off terms @xmath35 are not small .",
    "the effective potential appears unstable in renormalized perturbation theory because these large positive cut - off effects are neglected .",
    "the effective potential is always stable , as shown by numerical simulations and cut - off - dependent bare perturbation theory .",
    "this picture is confirmed in a calculation of the effective potential using a pauli - villars regulator , in the limit of a large number of fermion flavors @xcite .",
    "in the same model of a single component real scalar field coupled to staggered fermions , we show how to compute the correct @xmath0 lower bound ( see @xcite for some previous studies of higgs  top systems ) .",
    "we choose the bare parameters @xmath36 and @xmath26 to be in the higgs phase of the theory , close to the critical surface which separates the higgs and the symmetric phases . for a particular choice of bare parameters ,",
    "we measure @xmath37 , the renormalized vev in lattice spacing units , using @xmath38 to convert the momentum cut - off @xmath39 into physical units .    we measure @xmath0 and the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath40 from the scalar field propagator in momentum space @xmath41 @xmath42 [ eq : propagator ] where @xmath43 .",
    "we measure @xmath19 from the zero momentum piece of the fermion propagator .",
    "all simulations were performed in @xmath44 volumes , again using the hmc algorithm , varying the step - size @xmath45 to achieve acceptance rates of more than @xmath46 .",

    "for a given @xmath2 and @xmath19 , the smallest higgs mass is generated when @xmath50 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the upper bound , where @xmath0 is largest when @xmath51 . to keep the cut - off effects acceptably small ,",
    "we require both the scalar and fermion correlations lengths @xmath52 .",
    "the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : lower_bound ] corresponds to @xmath53 , to the left of the dashed line is the allowed region of small cut - off effects . from this",
    ", we can extract the lower bound .",
    "for example , in this model of 8 degenerate fermions , the smallest higgs mass that can be generated for @xmath54 and @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "the apparent instability of the higgs vacuum when coupled to a heavy top quark is due to the breakdown of renormalized perturbation theory when the cut - off effects are large .",
    "this places the current phenomenological @xmath0 lower bound in doubt .",
    "the correct lower bound in a particular cut - off scheme can be found by measuring the smallest higgs mass that can be generated while simultaneously keeping the cut - off effects acceptably small . a similar calculation for a realistic higgs  top system is a very timely and important project for the lattice community .",
