    "<S> our method is able to reproduce the exact results obtained by the diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> an application is given to investigate the half - filled band case of two - dimensional square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the energy is favorably compared with quantum monte carlo data . </S>",
    "<S> +   + key words : hubbard model , monte carlo method , off - diagonal function + </S>"
