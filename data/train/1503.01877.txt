    "it is widely accepted that dark matter is one of the main components of the universe . due to the strong observational evidence corroborating its existence many different areas of physics",
    "have incorporated dark matter related investigations in their agenda . according to the standard cosmological model , dark matter composes around @xmath3 of the universe s energy budget and @xmath4 of the total matter .",
    "baryons represent the remaining fraction of the latter .",
    "this picture has been confirmed by different data , but remarkably by the latest _ planck _ results @xcite .",
    "the crucial aspects of these studies concern the particle nature and the astrophysical / cosmological behavior of such component . at the particle level ,",
    "candidates belonging to the wimp ( weakly interacting massive particles ) category produce a viable model ( see @xcite  and references therein  for a very recent review ) . also , for the homogeneous , isotropic and expanding background , the dark matter ensemble should present a vanishing pressure in order to enable structure formation @xcite .    although the success of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario it is important to mention some of its drawbacks .",
    "the theoretical clustering patterns ( calculated via numerical simulations ) of cdm particles at galactic level correspond to the nfw profile @xcite which is cuspy at the centre of the particle distribution .",
    "this seems to be in clear contradiction to the observed velocities in the central region of galaxies which demand a cored distribution .",
    "at the same time , the simulated distribution of satellites around typical milk way like galaxies shows one order of magnitude excess of sub - structures which are not observed .",
    "these two issues are known as the cusp - core problem and the missing satellites problem , respectively . even if baryonic physics in such simulations could eventually alleviate these problems , it is not clear so far whether or not cdm is the correct model for the dark matter phenomena .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "one can argue that dark matter is a pathological manifestation of choosing einstein s general relativity ( gr ) as the gravitational theory .",
    "this suspect is the pillar of a research line in which modified gravity theories are invoked .",
    "see @xcite for reviews on modified gravity models and their observational constraints .",
    "however , reliable experiments at the solar system level confirm gr predictions with great accuracy @xcite .",
    "therefore , this fact seems to be powerful enough to keep in a fist moment gr as our standard description for gravitational interaction .",
    "since there are no confirmed evidence to abandon gr , dark matter remains being essential and therefore one needs new alternatives within this context . in this case , the possibilities are also vast .",
    "the classical ones were hot dark matter ( hdm ) @xcite and warm dark matter ( wdm ) @xcite .",
    "while the former has been ruled out due to the positive observation of galaxies below the jeans mass scale of relativistic dark matter particles , the latter is one of the leading rivals of cdm .",
    "indeed , particles with masses @xmath5 kev fit the wdm spirit .",
    "they are not as light as hdm particles and therefore allowing the existence of structures and , at the same time , not as heavy as cdm , in such a way that there would exist some suppression mechanism able to alleviate the small scale problems of the cdm paradigm ( see however @xcite for a recent discussion of wdm results )",
    ". models with a similar clustering dynamics as wdm are , for instance , fuzzy dark matter @xcite , the self interacting dark matter @xcite and the viscous dark matter @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a dark matter model which has a different nature .",
    "let us assume @xmath6spin dm particles having therefore a bosonic distribution .",
    "as predicted and already observed in laboratory bosonic particles are able to condensate @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , occupying the same energy state and forming the so - called bose - einstein condensates when their temperature reaches the critical value @xmath7 .",
    "of course , this phenomenon occurs under very controlled experimental situations , but one might wonder in principle what happens if the same would happen on astrophysical scales .",
    "although quite hypothetical this description could serve as an effective approach for understanding dark matter as a cosmological scalar field @xmath8 whose dynamics is driven by some repulsive potential @xmath9 .",
    "this gives rise to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) dark matter model which has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that normal , i.e. , non - condensate , dark matter undergoes a phase transition at some critical redshift @xmath10 during the universe s evolution .",
    "then , independently on the details of the transition , all the dark matter converts into the condensate state forming a bec `` fluid . ''",
    "the dynamics of bec systems is studied via the gross - pitaevskii equation , which is a nonlinear schrodinger equation @xcite . from this starting point , the madelung decomposition is used to transform the bec dynamics into a set of fluid equations resulting in an effective positive pressure . with such fluid picture one is able to investigate astrophysical / cosmological problems .",
    "this procedure will be shown in more details in the next section .",
    "the general aspects of this model concerning the background evolution and the linear perturbations are already very well understood @xcite .",
    "but , in order to fully understand the final clustering patterns of the bec dark matter model high resolution hydrodynamical / n - body simulations are still needed @xcite . more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has formulated smoothed - particle hydrodynamics numerical methods to solving general gross - pitaevskii - poisson system .",
    "schive et al @xcite provided recently high - resolution cosmological simulations for the model .",
    "they obtained that there is a remarkable difference at the internal galactic level , i.e. , its density profile .",
    "the latter result is indeed desired .",
    "however , they found that bec dm is indistinguishable from cdm at large cosmological scales .",
    "our focus here in this work is to understand such latter claim . from the theoretical point of view , a first step on this issue is the study of the nonlinear gravitational collapse in a cosmological background . concerning the bec dark matter model , recently ref .",
    "@xcite addressed the collapse of `` already formed bec condensates '' , i.e. , only the post - transition stage .",
    "nevertheless , a realistic configuration can be more complicated since it also involves the dynamics of the baryonic component as the universe evolves from the matter to the dark energy domination epochs .",
    "moreover , the phase transition can also take place during the evolution of the collapsed region .",
    "therefore , especially for galaxy cluster scales , the evolution of the background cosmological dynamics should be taken into account .",
    "we will perform in this work a natural extension of ref .",
    "@xcite which has analysed the `` free - fall '' collapsed of a bec dark matter sphere .",
    "however , we assume a more realistic cosmological scenario where dark matter coexist with baryons and a cosmological constant .",
    "then , we address the correct case where the transition occurs during the nonlinear clustering process .",
    "fundamental quantities here are the condensate parameters , namely , the mass of the particle @xmath0 and the scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "they determine the moment at which the phase transition takes place @xmath10 and the speed of sound in the condensate fluid , for example .",
    "after the critical redshift @xmath10 one can admit two different dynamics . the simplest case is to assume an abrupt transition , i.e. , for @xmath11 all dark matter obeys the bose - einstein dynamics .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable approximation to the problem .",
    "this situation will be studied in section [ sectioniii ] .",
    "one can also assume the case in which the full conversion of all dark matter occurs in a finite time and it finishes at a redshift @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the phase transition lasts a finite time in which a mixture of `` normal '' and condensate dark matter make up the total matter component .",
    "we study in section [ sectioniv ] this case .",
    "we present our results covering many order of magnitude in the model parameter space @xmath13 mev@xmath14 mev@xmath15 @xmath16 fm .",
    "interesting quantities to be found here are the final ( at @xmath17 ) value of the density contrast and the expansion rate and the redshift of the turnaround @xmath18 , i.e. , the moment at which the collapsed region detaches from the background .    in summary , this paper has the following structure . in the next section",
    "we develop the background dynamics of the bec dark matter .",
    "we present in section [ sectioniii ] general equations for the spherical top - hat collapse formalism .",
    "these equations will be studied in more detail in sections [ sectioniv ] and [ sectionv ] where , respectively , we address the case of abrupt transition and the usual phase transition .",
    "we conclude in the final section .",
    "in this work we always have a flat background dynamics composed by baryons , dark matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "this expansion rate reads @xmath19 the post - decoupling dynamics of the baryonic component is assumed to be pressureless @xmath20 and therefore @xmath21 where @xmath22 is its density today at @xmath17 .",
    "its value is such that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "we can safely adopt @xmath25 according to nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "the hubble constant assumed here is @xmath26 km / s / mpc .",
    "we will also fix @xmath27 or equivalently @xmath28 .",
    "the difference here from the standard @xmath29cdm model will be the dark matter dynamics .",
    "before the transition takes place , at temperatures @xmath30 ; or redshifts @xmath31 , dm behaves as an isotropic gas in thermal equilibrium . from kinetic theory the pressure of a non - relativistic gas in this regime",
    "is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of spin degrees of freedom , @xmath35 the planck constant , @xmath36 the momentum of a particle with energy @xmath37 and distribution function @xmath38 .",
    "a typical value for the velocity dispersion is @xmath39 . in practice , since this quantity can be seen as the dark matter equation of state parameter @xmath40 this value is consistent with the assumption of pressureless fluid usually adopted for cdm .",
    "note that the full relativistic fluid is obtained when @xmath41 .",
    "after dark matter s conversion it obeys the condensate dynamics , which is governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath42 where @xmath0 is the mass of the particle and @xmath43 is the trapping potential .",
    "the non - linearity term with only two - body interparticle interaction ( quadratic ) reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "this definition has the fundamental parameters of the model , namely the scattering length @xmath1 and the particle mass @xmath0 .",
    "the former is associated to the nature of the short range self - interactions in the condensate .",
    "for example , in laboratory systems , it can be either positive ( the case of rb@xmath46 atoms with @xmath47 nm and then repulsive interactions ) @xcite or negative ( the case of li@xmath48 atoms with @xmath49 nm and then attractive interactions ) @xcite .",
    "in this work we will consider only cases where @xmath50 .",
    "the impact of @xmath1 on the mass - radius configurations of astrophysical bec has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "note that there appears some degeneracy for the @xmath51 parameter , i.e. , there are infinities combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath52 capable to produce the same @xmath51 value .",
    "we discuss this degeneracy and the admissible numerical values of these parameters in the next sections .    in order to apply the gross - pitaevskii equation to astrophysical problems",
    "one proceeds with the so - called madelung decomposition . in this procedure , the wave function is replace by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number density of the system and @xmath55 is the velocity potential . the mass / energy density",
    "can be written in terms of the mass of each individual particle as @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the bec system can be described in terms of a hydrodynamical set of equations , which are @xmath57 where we define @xmath58    the particle self - interaction of this specific bec - inspired fluid gives rise to a pressure of polytropic form @xmath59 on the other hand , the quantum potential @xmath60 results in the often called quantum pressure .",
    "we can use the identity @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the quantum anisotropic pressure tensor @xcite , given by @xmath63    for the problem we have in mind , the potential @xmath43 in ( [ gp ] ) is in fact the gravitational potential which is sourced by @xmath64 via the poisson equation @xmath65 .",
    "this allows us to solve the system of equations .    in the cases where the pressure due to the particle self - interaction dominates ,",
    "the quantum anisotropic pressure can be neglected .",
    "this is the so called thomas - fermi approximation . in @xcite",
    "the authors estimated , for the case of bec dark matter halos , in which cases the thomas - fermi limit is valid .",
    "they consider the forces associated with both pressures , that balances the gravitational collapse , and find that the thomas - fermi regime is valid when @xmath66 where @xmath67 adopting @xmath68 as the mean radius and @xmath69 as the mass of a bec dark matter halo it is found that    @xmath70    the quantity ( [ kappah ] ) can be written in characteristic values @xmath71 if we consider halos with a size between the milky way ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) and a typical dwarf galaxy ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) we can constraint @xmath76 in the range @xmath77 using the model parameters range which will be adopted in this work ( @xmath13 mev@xmath14 mev@xmath15 @xmath16 fm ) we calculate that @xmath78 which indicates that the thomas - fermi approximation can be adopted .",
    "another comment about the justification of the use of the thomas - fermi approximation relies on the fact that we are going to focus on the largest cosmological scales .",
    "for example , in the fourier space density perturbations are affected by the quantum pressure contribution proportionally to @xmath79 while usual pressure contributions modifies the evolution of the density contrast ( which will be defined soon ) according to @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quantum pressure corrections could be relevant for the very small scales . besides , in the top - hat spherical collapse the density of all fluids inside the spherical overdense region is homogeneous @xcite and the anisotropic pressure ( [ anisotropic ] )",
    "should be zero .    a cosmological dark matter fluid with the above pressure leads to the background expansion @xmath81 where @xmath64 is the bec dark matter density , which in the thomas - fermi limit is determined by the pressure ( [ pbec ] ) via the continuity equation .",
    "more details will be discussed in sections [ sectioniv ] and [ sectionv ] .",
    "in fact , we will follow in this work the background expansion determined in ref . @xcite .",
    "here we present the basic equations that describe the evolution of a spherical collapsing matter region in an expanding background .",
    "this is the ideal technique for studying the clustering patterns of dark matter halos .",
    "we will follow standard calculations presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . for general fluids , we define quantities such as @xmath82 they are respectively the velocity , density and pressure of the collapsed region .",
    "the background velocity expansion is given by @xmath83 and is associated with the hubble s law .",
    "peculiar motions are denoted by @xmath84 . the total density within this spherical region under collapse @xmath85 is written as the sum of the background density and the overdensity fraction @xmath86 .",
    "the same happens to the pressure definition .    the rate at which the overdense region expands reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "energy conservation is also required for the collapsing region .",
    "therefore , each component @xmath89 obeys a separate equation of the type @xmath90\\frac{\\theta}{a},\\ ] ] where the energy density contrast is defined as @xmath91 and the effective speed of sound is computed following @xmath92 .",
    "note that over dot means derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath93 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the homogeneous spherical region will be governed by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath94    for a cosmological model composed by @xmath95 distinct fluids one has to solve @xmath96 equations .",
    "one of the type [ eqdeltaorig ] for each fluid and , since we adopt the top - hat profile , one single equation for the velocity potential @xmath97 which is sourced by the density fluctuations of the @xmath95 fluids .",
    "since we will use the standard @xmath29cdm universe as our reference model here we show its equations for the spherical collapse .",

    "therefore , it influences this set of equations only via the expansion rate @xmath101 . in order to numerically solve ( [ blambda]-[thetalambda ] )",
    "one usually specifies the initial conditions for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath97 at the redshift of decoupling @xmath104 from which one can treat baryons as an independent fluid .",
    "the temperature @xmath7 sets the beginning of the bec phase transition .",
    "this is in fact a process which takes some finite time @xmath105 until all the normal dark matter has been converted into the bec phase . as estimated in @xcite @xmath105",
    "is of order of @xmath106 years .",
    "although the latter value is parameter dependent , it is in general indeed an almost negligible fraction of the universe s lifetime .",
    "therefore , the assumption that at @xmath10 there is an instantaneous conversion to the bec phase seems to be plausible and it will be considered in this section .    for @xmath31 the dark matter equation of state calculated in ( [ pdm ] ) reads @xmath107 where @xmath108 . applying this to the continuity equation one finds @xmath109 where @xmath10 is the redshift at the transition point and @xmath110 .",

    "however , is this case , it would be impossible to probe the bosonic nature of dark matter since the transition will happen in a far future .",
    "on the other hand , over the long - dashed line the transition happens at the time of photon - baryon decoupling . in principle , @xmath131 is also allowed but its possible effect on the primordial cmb anisotropies is still not clearly known .",

    "the curves are again indistinguishable .",
    "the redshift of turnaround @xmath215 is the one which marks the moment when the perturbed region starts to decrease its physical radius .",
    "this happens when @xmath216 , i.e. , @xmath217 . for @xmath29cdm model @xmath218 and for the cases seen in both panels of fig .",

    "we have studied the nonlinear clustering properties of the bose - einstein dark matter model . in this scenario ,",
    "bosonic dark matter particles are able to undergo a phase transition as their temperature reaches the critical one @xmath7 which corresponds to some critical redshift @xmath10 .",
    "the main questions here are : i ) how does @xmath10 depend on the fundamental model parameters @xmath0 ( the particle mass ) and @xmath1 ( the scattering length ) ? and",
    "ii ) what is the background and perturbative dynamics during the phase transition ?    fig .",
    "[ zca ] shows in detail the expected degeneracy of @xmath10 values in the @xmath1 x @xmath0 plane , i.e. , for a given @xmath10 , there are many admissible parameter configurations .",
    "this result identifies the parameters values for which @xmath139 and therefore are able to leave imprints on large scale structure observations . at the same time , if the actual parameters values of the bec model lie in the region @xmath220 then the bosonic nature of the dark matter particles can not be accessed via cosmological observables . if the present model is employed for bec phase - transitions , ultra - light candidates ( @xmath221 ev ) would only lead to possible observational imprints for @xmath1 of order of the planck length or smaller .",
    "note that this claim is limited to the fluid description used here .",
    "recent calculations on the full dynamics of the ultra - light axion scalar field sho that there are indeed possible observable imprints in the cosmological data @xcite .",
    "our strategy was to identify specific signatures of the bec dark matter nonlinear clustering . since there is a positive pressure associated to the bec dark fluid one can expect that the corresponding effective speed of sound will modifies somehow the agglomeration rate .",
    "we tried to understand this process via both the abrupt and the smooth phase transition approaches . in the former scenario",
    "the dark matter dynamics changes suddenly at @xmath10 . in the latter ,",
    "there is a continuous conversion from the `` normal '' to the bec phase .",
    "although we showed that the smooth transition can indeed last quite a significant fraction of the universe lifetime .",
    "then , it seems that this case could , eventually , lead to a remarkable dynamics .",
    "however , in both approaches of the phase transition we could not identify any relevant difference between the bec model and the standard cdm model .",
    "this is mostly because the model parameters leading to @xmath220 produce almost negligible @xmath222 values . on one hand",
    ", this guarantees that the nonlinear clustering patterns of the bec model at large scales are very similar to the cdm model .",
    "we have provided a theoretical confirmation for the recent numerical results of schive et al @xcite which claims that the differences between bec dm and standard cdm appears only in the internal structure of dm halos rather than on the cosmological large scale distribution . on the other hand , this eliminates the cosmological nonlinear perturbative study as a possible technique to probe the bosonic nature of dark matter particles .",
    "it is also worth noting that the typical value for the critical overdensity for collapse @xmath223 remains unchanged for the bec parameter space probed here .",
    "perharps , this conclusion is in part due to the fact we have assumed a simple version of the first order phase transition of the bec dm model . taking properly into account , for example , the latent heat released during the transition and the resulting dynamics associated to the nucleation of the new bubbles we could end up with a very drastic effect on the non - linear clustering .",
