    "hilbert s sixteenth problem , in its general form , asks for the study of the maximal number and the possible arrangements of the components of a nonsingular real algebraic hypersurface of degree @xmath2 in @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that even the case of curves in @xmath9 is an extremely subtle problem and essentially nothing is known for @xmath10 .",
    "the analogous question for a hypersurface in @xmath11 is trivial , as for a _ generic _ choice of the polynomial defining it , its topology is determined ( this is the statement that the cohomology of a complete intersection in the complex projective space is determined by its multidegree and complete intersections are generic ) .",
    "thus , if from one hand no technique exists to study the arrangement of the components of a real algebraic hypersurface , on the other hand one still would like to formulate ",
    "typical \" statements : a way for doing that is to replace the word _ generic _ with _",
    "let us start by considering the case of hypersurfaces in @xmath12 , i.e. zeros of ordinary univariate polynomials .",
    "in fact here we consider the _ homogenization _ of a univariate polynomial together with its _ projective _ roots rather than the classical polynomial itself , but it is clear that the two objects produce the same statistic . over the complex numbers statements like : @xmath13 make perfect sense . on the other hand",
    "the only property we can say to be generic for the real roots of a real polynomial is the one of being distinct .    proposing a random viewpoint raises the obvious question : _ what is meant by random ? _",
    "we first look to the seminal work @xcite of kac , who proved that a random univariate polynomial of degree @xmath2 whose coefficients are i.i.n . has asymptotically @xmath14 real roots . even if it might seem natural , the distribution kac considered is not invariant by the action of projective transformations over the extended real line . to produce such an invariant distribution we proceed as follows .",
    "we first _ extend _ our space of polynomials by homogenization ; this leads us to consider _ projective _ zeros rather than just on the real line .",
    "thus , we consider the vector space @xmath15 of real homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath2 in two variables .",
    "we endow this vector space with a euclidean structure by considering the @xmath16-norm of the restriction of these polynomials to the circle @xmath17 . in an equivalent way we can define for @xmath1 and @xmath18 in @xmath15 their scalar product to be : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the variable in @xmath21 .",
    "notice that since @xmath1 and @xmath18 are homogeneous of the same degree , the previous integral equals the integral of @xmath22 restricted to the circle @xmath17 ( up to a constant factor ) . using this scalar product",
    "we can define a _ centered gaussian _",
    "probability distribution on @xmath15 by letting for a measurable subset @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the constant that makes the previous a probability distribution and @xmath1 is treated as the integration variable that runs over @xmath26    for us a _",
    "random polynomial _ will simply be a polynomial in @xmath15 with the above distribution .",
    "having thus replaced _ generic _ with _ random _ , we can make a positive statement in the real setting : @xmath27 we provide now another equivalent definition of a random polynomial .",
    "we fix a basis @xmath28 for @xmath15 which is orthonormal for the above scalar product and we consider a random function of the form : @xmath29 what we get in this way is again a random polynomial in the above sense .",
    "one way to produce such a basis is by considering _",
    "trigonometric polynomials _",
    ", i.e. functions on the circle satisfying : @xmath30 we denote by @xmath31 the vector space of all the solutions of the previous equation : these must be linear combinations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "equivalently we can extend such functions by homogeneity to all @xmath21 and we get harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath34 .",
    "what is interesting for us is that in this fashion we can write the vector space @xmath15 as : @xmath35 where again @xmath20 is the variable in @xmath21 and the direct sum turns out to be orthogonal with respect to the above scalar product .",
    "in particular the above orthonormal basis can be obtained by collecting together the orthonormal bases coming from each @xmath31 , @xmath36 .",
    "if we repeat the same construction for the scalar product @xmath37 then the corresponding real random polynomials are called _ kostlan _ distributed ( or _ bombieri - weyl _ ) .",
    "the vector space is the same , but in this second case the euclidean structure comes by restricting to the real polynomials the hermitian structure given on the complex ones .",
    "the expectation of the number of real roots of a real kostlan polynomial of degree @xmath2 is @xmath38 .",
    "already from this comparison we see that the structure of the zeros of a random polynomial is richer than the one of a kostlan , which in turn is richer than for the naive ensemble .",
    "the two numbers @xmath39 and @xmath2 are called the _ parameters _ of these distributions .",
    "more generally each gaussian distribution on @xmath15 that is invariant by projective transformation has its parameter @xmath40 which is defined to be the square of the expected number of zeros it produces .",
    "our interest is in what happens when we increase the number of variables .",
    "we let @xmath41 be the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath2 in @xmath42 variables , and consider their zero sets as hypersurfaces in @xmath0 . if in the univariate case as a  measure \" of our set we could use the number of its points , here we have at least two possible approaches to generalize this idea .",
    "the first one is by considering the number of points as a zero - dimensional volume . in this case",
    "an upper bound for the  size \" of our set is provided by means that there exist two constants @xmath43 such that for @xmath2 large enough @xmath44 : @xmath45    the previous formula comes from an application of the integral geometry formula and wirtinger s inequality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact if @xmath1 is regular the previous volume is bounded by @xmath46 and since @xmath47 this also gives a nice way to compare the real zero locus to the complex one ( as we did in the univariate case using the fundamental theorem of algebra ) .",
    "the second approach is more subtle and regards the number of points as a topological property ( rather than a metric one ) , namely as the number of connected components .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there is a quantitative bound also for this number , usually referred to as milnor s bound ( see @xcite ) : @xmath48    the original paper @xcite of milnor does not contain the bound in this form , since a @xmath49 term appears",
    ". we will give a proof of ( [ milnor ] ) in the appendix for the smooth case ( which is the case we are interested in , since the set of nonregular polynomials has _ measure zero _ in @xmath41 ) , though the same bound holds true even for singular hypersurfaces .    as we already pointed out , for a generic @xmath1 in @xmath41 both the volume and",
    "the betti numbers are constant for its complex zero locus .",
    "this is certainly not the case for the real zero locus , as for example it might even be empty . to study the expectation of these quantities over the reals",
    "we make @xmath41 into a gaussian space .",
    "we first define the scalar product of two elements @xmath1 and @xmath18 in it to be : @xmath50 using this scalar product @xmath41 is turned into a probability space by defining for each of its measurable subsets @xmath23 : @xmath51 where now @xmath52    following @xcite , we call @xmath41 with the resulting distribution of probability the _ real fubini - study ensemble_.    the expectation of the volume of the zero locus of a random polynomial of degree @xmath2 from the real fubini - study ensemble was computed by p. brgisser in @xcite : @xmath53 in fact in the paper @xcite this result follows from the more striking computation of the expected curvature polynomial of @xmath54 for any projectively invariant distribution . such a result is formulated in terms of the above mentioned parameter @xmath40 , which in this case is the square of the average number of real zeros of a restriction to an @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , if we define the _ kostlan _ distribution on @xmath41 by means of the scalar product @xmath55 , the corresponding parameter is @xmath2 and the result we get for the expectation of the volume is @xmath56 ( the general result for a distribution with parameter @xmath40 is @xmath57 ) .    in the case @xmath58 and restricting the distribution of probability to @xmath59 , i.e. considering only _ harmonic _ polynomials rather than homogeneous ones , the statistics of the number of connected components was studied by nazarov and sodin . in the breakthrough paper",
    "@xcite the authors prove that there exists a constant @xmath60 such that for a random spherical harmonic @xmath1 of degree @xmath2 : @xmath61 moreover , they showed that @xmath62 concentrates exponentially about its mean .    in the visionary handwritten letter",
    "@xcite p. sarnak claims that using the same ideas as in @xcite it is possible to extend this result to the case of real homogeneous polynomials in the real fubini - study ensemble .",
    "the interesting part of these statements ( besides the concentration ) is the lower bound estimate : an upper bound of the same order is given by milnor s one ( or in the spherical harmonic case by courant s nodal domain theorem ) .",
    "the statistics of the number of connected components of a kostlan distributed curve was studied by gayet and welschinger : in the paper @xcite the authors prove that such a real curve of degree @xmath2 has on average @xmath63 components .",
    "the same authors prove in @xcite that the expectation of _ each _ betti number of a kostlan hypersurface in @xmath0 is bounded by @xmath64 , generalizing in some sense the univariate case .    on a different perspective the first author in @xcite ,",
    "using techniques from random matrix theory , has studied intersection of one or two kostlan distributed quadrics , the asymptotic being this time in the number @xmath4 of variables ; for such random algebraic sets the expectation of the sum of the betti numbers behaves asymptotically as @xmath4 .    as we did before , it is possible to give an equivalent definition of the real fubini - study structure on @xmath41 using an @xmath65-orthonormal basis .",
    "in fact we can again decompose our vector space into the _ orthogonal _ sum : @xmath66 where now @xmath67 is the vector space of spherical harmonics of degree @xmath34 , i.e. those functions on the sphere @xmath68 satisfying : @xmath69    inspired by the ideas of @xcite and @xcite we study a more general class of random polynomials that contains as special cases both the homogeneous and the harmonic ones . to define such a class , for every @xmath70 $ ] and",
    "@xmath71 let us consider the following index set : @xmath72=\\{\\textrm{natural numbers $ l$ such that",

    "there is no unified convention for the names of these ensembles .",
    "in fact the name _ real _ fubini - study should be distunguished from _",
    "complex _ fubini - study which is another name for what we called kostlan distributed .",
    "+ in this paper we will only deal with the _ real fubini - study _ ensemble and its restriction to @xmath75}.$ ] for this reason , since no confusion can arise , a _",
    "random polynomial _ for us will simply mean a polynomial from this ensemble .    in particular for @xmath76",
    "we get random homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath2 and for @xmath77 we get random spherical harmonics of degree @xmath2 : @xmath78}= w_{n , d }   \\quad \\textrm{and}\\quad h_{[d , d]}=h_{n , d}.\\ ] ]    in fact we do not need to restrict to the case the @xmath73-window contains only the eigenspaces @xmath67 with @xmath79 even .",
    "our choice is motivated by the fact that we want to avoid redundancy in order to get random polynomials for @xmath76 ; one can consider as well the full window .",

    "[ volume]let @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath1 be a random polynomial in @xmath75}$ ] .",
    "then : @xmath90    in particular taking expectation on both sides of inequality ( [ introvolume ] ) turns it into an equality ( the volume on the projective space and the one on the sphere being related by a constant that depends only on @xmath4 ) .",
    "we notice that the statement for @xmath77 was proved by brard in @xcite and for @xmath76 by brgisser @xcite as stated above in ( [ volumeburg ] ) .",
    "in fact it is possible to write the exact value of this expectation using an analog of what we called the parameter of the distribution , defined in this case as @xmath91}l(l+n-1)d(n , l)$ ] ; the expectation of the volume is then @xmath92 the same statement holds for the projective zero locus , as it is double covered by the spherical one .",
    "the statistics of the number of connected components is more subtle and requires more work , drawing on the ideas of @xcite .",
    "the statement we will prove is the following .    [ thm : main ] let @xmath93 $ ] , and @xmath1 be a random polynomial in @xmath81}}$ ] . then : @xmath94    in analogy with the case of the volume , this theorem says that if we take expectation on both sides of milnor s bound ( [ milnor ] ) we turn it into an equality ( the number of connected components on the projective space and those on the sphere being related by a factor of _ two _ ) .",
    "notice that the case @xmath58 and @xmath77 gives the spherical harmonic case proved by nazarov and sodin in @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath58 and @xmath76 gives sarnak s claim @xcite on curves from the real fubini - study ensemble .    after this paper was written , the authors have been informed by f. nazarov and m. sodin that they have an alternative approach to this problem , that works in more general settings ; a summary of their ideas is available at @xcite .",
    "the authors have also been informed by p. sarnak that together with i. wigman they are able to provide asymptotics for the expected number of ovals of a random plane curve for the _ naive _ model ( the defining coefficients for the monomials are independent normals with mean zero and variance one ) , the kostlan model and the real fubini - study one .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the case @xmath76 and @xmath58 , i.e. random real algebraic curves .",
    "the first part of hilbert s sixteenth problem asks to study the configuration of the components of a real algebraic curve of degree @xmath2 in the plane @xmath95 the nullhomotopic components of such curves are called _ ovals _ ; each one of them separates @xmath9 in two components : one of them is homeomorphic to a disk ( and is called the _",
    "interior _ of the oval ) and the other to a moebius band . in the case",
    "@xmath2 is even all components are ovals , but if @xmath2 is odd there is a component that is not an oval ( it is homotopic to a projective line and generates the fundamental group of @xmath9 ) .",
    "harnack s theorem states that such curves can not have more than @xmath96 components , but the possible arrangements of their ovals is a far more complicated problem ; we refer the reader to the beautiful survey @xcite on the subject .",
    "in fact the problem itself of constructing curves with many ovals is a difficult one .",
    "gayet and welschinger s theorem @xcite on the exponential rarefaction of maximal curves confirms such difficulty : if we write the equation of a curve putting some coefficients in front of the standard monomials , it is exponentially difficult to get one with many ovals .",
    "this  approach \" of building curves depends on the choice of the basis we want to use for @xmath97 ; if instead of the monomial basis ( which is orthogonal for the bombieri scalar product , inducing the kostlan distribution ) we use the spherical harmonics the result improves dramatically .",
    "in fact now , because of theorem [ thm : main ] for @xmath76 and @xmath58 the expectation of the number of components of the curve we obtain is a fraction of the maximal one .",
    "the price we pay is that we are no longer allowed to use the simple monomial basis and we need an explicit expression for the polynomials representing spherical harmonics , such an expression being quite complicated .",
    "a completely analogous discussion holds for real hypersurfaces : now the fact that what we get applying theorem [ thm : main ] is on average a fraction of the maximal number of components is due to milnor s bound .",
    "the method employed here ( based on the ideas of nazarov and sodin ) suggests that more generally one could ask for the expected _ arrangement _ of such ovals .",
    "in fact essentially the proof relies on the following observation : given any point @xmath20 on the sphere and a small disk around it of radius @xmath98 there is a positive probability ( independent of @xmath2 ) of finding an oval inside such small disk ( and such oval loops around @xmath20 ) .",
    "unfortunately this probability , even if constant , is still very little .",
    "a numerical computation of the expectation of the number of components for @xmath58 was performed by m. nastasescu in @xcite : as sarnak writes in his letter  a random curve is 4% harnack \" .",
    "thus , the random version of hilbert s sixteenth problem , to study the expected _ arrangement _ of a random curve , is still open and despite its difficulty it seems to be very fascinating .",
    "one of the main difficulties in this framework is to define a statistic ( beyond the number of components ) that captures some features of the arrangement .",
    "we suggest one that we call the _ energy _ of the curve @xmath99 .",
    "first we say that one _ oval _",
    "@xmath100 is contained into another one @xmath101 if it lies in the interior of @xmath101 .",
    "using containment we can give a partial ordering on ovals and construct a forest ( a collection of trees ) representing their arrangement .",
    "the vertices of the trees represent the ovals , with the empty ovals represented by leaves , and an oval not contained in any other is represented by a root .",
    "we define an energy that is additive for disjoint unions of trees , and multiplicative when appending trees .",
    "so the energy of a forest is the sum of the energies of its trees .",
    "we define the energy of a tree with only one isolated vertex as @xmath102 , and of a larger tree inductively as twice the sum of the energies of all subtrees that result from removing its root .",
    "this description determines the energy of any forest ( for example , see figure [ fig : tree ] ) .     and the corresponding forest .",
    "the energy is @xmath103 . ]    by bzout s theorem the length of each tree can not be more than @xmath104 and if such a tree exists then no other trees can appear ; the corresponding curve is said to be maximally nested and its energy is @xmath105 . on a somehow opposite direction one can consider harnack curves , having @xmath106 ( for @xmath2 large enough ) .",
    "such curves have the maximal number of components and satisfy some special condition on the arrangement of their ovals ; we refer the reader to @xcite for the exact definition and to @xcite for surprising connections with planar dimers .",
    "thus , using this notion , one open problem that we can state on the expected arrangement is to describe the asymptotic behavior as @xmath2 goes to infinity of the energy of a random curve .",
    "the pictures we get of a random curve suggest that the energy has the same order as a harnack curve , so we conjecture that : @xmath107 ( the lower bound follows from theorem [ thm : main ] ) .      in section 2",
    ", we specialize to the case @xmath108 .",
    "this helps to illustrate the main techniques used in the paper and provides a proof for the value of the parameter @xmath40 used section 6.2 .",
    "theorem [ volume ] is proved in section3 and theorem [ thm : main ] in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the proof of the main technical lemmas for theorem [ thm : main ] . in section 6",
    "we discuss some examples ( more on random curves and random surfaces ) . in the appendix we provide the proof of milnor s bound , we review a construction of hyperspherical harmonics , as well as some of their properties .",
    "the authors are grateful to s. basu for his constant support and many useful suggestions and a. lancichinetti for stimulating discussions .",
    "to illustrate the main ideas , we first consider a random polynomial in the special case @xmath108 . as mentioned in the introduction , in this case",
    "both the zero dimensional volume and the number of connected components coincide . for simplicity of notation",
    "we will denote their expectation by : @xmath109 in view of the generalization to higher dimensions , we will give two proofs that @xmath110 .",
    "the first one is based on techniques coming from _ integral geometry _ and will produce an exact result ; this proof will generalize to any number of variables producing again an exact result .",
    "the second is based on the _ barrier method _ introduced by nazarov and sodin ; it will produce only an approximate result but has the advantage that it generalizes to higher dimensions .",
    "we notice that in the case @xmath108 , a real random polynomial is just a trigonometric polynomial with either only even or only odd terms ( depending on whether @xmath2 is even or odd ) .      the first proof is obtained following the ideas of @xcite . recall that if we have functions @xmath111 defined on the real line we can consider the random function : @xmath112 then if the coefficients are independently distributed , the expected number of zeros of @xmath1 on the interval @xmath113 $ ] is given by the formula : @xmath114$}\\}=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_a^b\\| \\dot{\\gamma}(t ) \\|dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the projection of the curve @xmath116 on the unit sphere @xmath117 ( we refer the reader to the beautiful paper @xcite for this and related topics ) . we note that ( [ expintgeom ] ) is proved using a special case of the _ kinematic formula _ from integral geometry . in our case @xmath113=[0 , 2\\pi]$ ] and",
    "if @xmath2 is even , @xmath118 the curve @xmath119 is given by : @xmath120 and its norm in @xmath121 is constant and equals @xmath122 in particular we have : @xmath123 the norm of @xmath124 is @xmath125 which easily simplifies to : @xmath126 a similar calculation in the case @xmath2 is odd gives the exact same result .",
    "we are now in the position to use formula ( [ expintgeom ] ) and we obtain that the expected number of zeros of @xmath1 on @xmath127 $ ] is @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the number @xmath129 of expected zeros on the _ real projective line _ is : @xmath130 notice that this is an exact result and gives the asymptotic @xmath131      in this section we only prove that @xmath132 for @xmath2 large enough ; the inequality @xmath133 follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra . the proof is centered around the function described in the following claim whose proof is deferred until the end .",
    "there exist numerical constants @xmath134 and @xmath135 such that , for each sufficiently large @xmath2 and each @xmath136 there is a homogeneous polynomial @xmath137 of degree @xmath2 and @xmath16-norm one satisfying : @xmath138    once a point @xmath20 in @xmath17 is fixed , we can decompose @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a gaussian random variable with variance @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is in the orthogonal complement to @xmath143 in @xmath15 .",
    "we choose a new gaussian random variable @xmath144 independent of @xmath140 and of @xmath142 with variance @xmath141 , and set : @xmath145 by construction the random functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 have the same distribution as @xmath1 .",

    "there exists a constant @xmath149 such that @xmath150 for every @xmath20 in @xmath151    we also defer the proof of this claim in favor of first seeing how it is used .",

    ". we can thus apply poincar duality and get the equality @xmath456 using the definition of the euler characteristic we get : @xmath457 and @xmath458 we notice that in the case @xmath1 has _ even _ degree then it defines a function on @xmath459 as well , thus @xmath453 is orientable and the same asymptotic holds ; in the case @xmath2 is odd , the zero locus on the sphere is still orientable , but the one on the projective space might have nonorientable components ; in particular poincar duality holds only for @xmath460 coefficients . in this case",
    "we get similar asymptotic using betti numbers with @xmath460 coefficients .",
    "as we said in the introduction , we only need to prove the bound for a regular @xmath1 ( the corresponding zero locus is smooth ) ; the set of nonregular @xmath1 is a proper algebraic subset of @xmath41 , hence with measure ( and probability ) zero . in fact",
    "this proof can be modified to obtain a bound of the same order also for nonregular polynomials , using techniques from semialgebraic geometry , but this is far beyond our scope .    to start with ,",
    "notice that it suffices to give a bound for the sum of the betti numbers , since this will bound in particular @xmath461 moreover the universal coefficients theorem implies that the sum of the betti numbers with _",
    "coefficient is bounded by the sum of the betti numbers with @xmath460 coefficients ( see @xcite ) : @xmath462 now we use the so called _ smith s inequality _ , as presented in @xcite .",
    "this is the statement that for a topological space @xmath463 with an involution @xmath464 , the inequality @xmath465 holds . in particular , since @xmath1 is a _",
    "real _ polynomial , the complex conjugation is an involution on @xmath466 and smith s inequality reads : @xmath467 we use now the fact that @xmath466 is a _ nonsingular hypersurface _ in @xmath11 of degree @xmath2 .",
    "this property has two consequences : first , its cohomology has no torsion and @xmath468 ( lemma 3.1 of @xcite ) ; second , such cohomology is completely determined by @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and in particular : @xmath469 the explicit formula in the above line is a consequence of the _ adjunction _ formula , which provides the euler characteristic of @xmath466 ( see exercise ( 3.7 ) in @xcite ) ; the formula for the sum of the betti numbers immediately follows from poincar duality . finally ,",
    "since @xmath470 double covers @xmath54 , the same bound holds for : @xmath471    it is interesting to notice that in the case @xmath1 is _ harmonic _ , this bound can be obtained using courant s nodal domain theorem . in fact",
    "this theorem implies that the number of nodal domains of @xmath1 on @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath472 , is bounded by @xmath245 and the long exact sequence for the pair @xmath473 provides the bound ( the reader is referred to @xcite for these effective techniques from homological algebra ) .",
    "this proof using courant s theorem applies even when the zero set of @xmath1 is not regular , but it does nt work for a _ linear combination _ of harmonic functions .          as mentioned in section [ sec :",
    "lemma2 ] , an orthonormal basis for @xmath67 can be built up inductively .",
    "namely , start with an orthonormal basis for @xmath479}h_{n-1,m}.\\ ] ] for each such basis element , we obtain a basis element for @xmath67 .",
    "this entails that the dimension of the space @xmath67 is the same as the dimension of the space @xmath480}h_{n-1,m}$ ] .",
    "it is instructive to check this using the known formulas for each , that is , to verify directly that @xmath481 which follows from cancellation in the sum along with the recurrence relation for binomial coefficients .",
    "we follow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) in order to state the details resulting from the inductive construction of an orthonormal basis for @xmath67 ( restricted to the sphere @xmath68 ) of degree @xmath34 .",
    "suppose an orthonormal basis @xmath369 for @xmath370 has already been constructed for each @xmath371 , where @xmath372 is an index set of size @xmath373 .",
    "we can then obtain a spherical harmonic in @xmath42 variables ( restricted to the sphere @xmath68 ) of degree @xmath34 as follows @xmath482 in the previous formula @xmath375 is the gegenbauer polynomial , @xmath376 is the angle from the north - pole , the multi - angle @xmath377 gives the remaining coordinates , and the normalization constant @xmath378 is given by : @xmath483 writing these functions for all @xmath484 and for all @xmath485 generates an orthonormal basis for @xmath67 .    in order to produce the normalized zonal harmonic @xmath486 that was heavily utilized in section [ sec : lemma1 ] , take @xmath487 in the formula ( [ spherical ] ) .",
    "so the polynomial @xmath488 is constant and : @xmath489 where @xmath490 is the @xmath491-dimensional volume of @xmath396 and @xmath492 the gegenbauer polynomials satisfy ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 4.7.3 ) ) : @xmath493 together with ( [ zonalgeg ] ) this implies that @xmath494      theorem 8.21.12 in @xcite states an asymptotic for the jacobi polynomials .",
    "in particular this applies to the polynomial @xmath498 , and taking @xmath499 , we obtain the asymptotic that was used in section [ sec : lemma1 ] .",
    "@xmath500 where @xmath501 @xmath502 and the error term @xmath311 is always less than @xmath503 ( see the remark in @xcite immediately following theorem 8.21.12 ) .",
    "the proof uses a standard reproducing kernel argument .",
    "let @xmath505 be the zonal harmonic in @xmath4 variables with pole at the point @xmath506.this is not the normalized zonal , it is the reproducing kernel as defined in @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath505 acts as a reproducing kernel for the whole space of homogeneous harmonics of degree @xmath389 .",
    "in particular , @xmath507 the cauchy - schwarz inequality yields @xmath508 where we have used @xmath509 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , proposition 5.27 ) .",
    "now , taking the maximum over the sphere , then taking expectations over both sides of the inequality ( [ eq : cs ] ) , we have : @xmath510 the inequality in the claim now follows from the general inequality @xmath511 for a random variable @xmath448 ( it is an application of cauchy - schwarz again ) .",
