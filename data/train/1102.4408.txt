    "circumstellar disks are usually formed around young stars and are intricately tied to the origin of planets @xcite .",
    "giant planets have been considered to form via gas accretion onto rocky cores in such disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can successfully explain `` normal '' giant planets like ours .",
    "however , recent direct detections of companions with masses of a few up to a few tens of @xmath9 at distances @xmath820 au , beyond what had been thought to be the planet forming zone @xcite , pose a challenge for the standard core - accretion scenario where planets are formed _ in - situ_. planet migration after formation such as planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or gravitational instability ( gi ) scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may account for such wide - orbit massive planets . to test these theories ,",
    "information on the detailed structures of the inner ( @xmath5 @xmath1050 au ) regions of protoplanetary disks is crucial .",
    "one of the best candidates to investigate the inner ( @xmath5 @xmath1050 au ) regions is the prototype young intermediate - mass star ab aur which is one of the most intensively studied herbig ae stars ( @xmath11 pc ; @xmath12 2.4 @xmath13 0.2 @xmath14 ; an age of 4 @xmath13 1 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ab aur is also known to possess a large ( @xmath5 @xmath81000 au ) nebula @xcite .",
    "a more compact ( @xmath5 @xmath7450 au ) rotating disk was detected by millimeter observations with a disk mass of @xmath720 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "near - infrared imaging has revealed a spiral structure in the outer ( @xmath5 @xmath6200 au ) part of the disk @xcite .",
    "a more recent study revealed structures at intermediate distances from the star ( 40 au @xmath10 @xmath5 @xmath10 300 au ) and reported a possible point source in a `` dip '' of the @xmath1 image in the inner disk region @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a subsequent study failed to confirm the point source @xcite .",
    "however , all these observations were limited either by the inner working distance ( @xmath5 @xmath840 au ) or the spatial resolution ( @xmath714 au ) . in this @xmath15",
    ", we present polarized intensity ( hereafter @xmath1 ) images with the smallest inner working angle to the central star ( @xmath5 @xmath822 au ) and that the highest spatial resolution ( 9 au ) to date to reveal fine structures in the inner ( @xmath5 @xmath1050 au ) regions .",
    "@xmath16-band ( 1.6 @xmath0 ) linear polarization images of ab aur were obtained with a newly commissioned high - contrast imaging instrument hiciao @xcite combined with dual - beam polarimetry on the subaru 8.2 m telescope on 2009 october 31 ut .",
    "the observations were conducted under the program seeds ( strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the polarimetric observation mode , @xmath17- and @xmath18-rays",
    "are observed simultaneously , each has 10@xmath3 by 20@xmath3 field of view with a pixel scale of 9.3 mas / pixel , and therefore , @xmath19i is free from subtraction of reference psfs . for the ab aur observations",
    ", we used a small circular occulting mask of 0.@xmath33 diameter .",
    "the polarizations were measured by rotating the half waveplate to four angular positions ( in the order of 0@xmath20 , 45@xmath20 , 22.5@xmath20 , and 67.5@xmath20 ) .",
    "we obtained seven data sets by repeating the cycle of waveplate rotations taking a 23.7-s exposure per waveplate position each cycle .",
    "the adaptive optics system ( ao188 ; * ? ? ? * ) provided a diffraction limited and mostly stable stellar psf with fwhm of 0.@xmath306 in the @xmath16 band .",
    "low quality images were removed prior to final production of the images .",
    "we used the four best data sets and the total integration time of the @xmath1 image was 189.6 s.    the data were reduced in the standard manner of infrared image reduction using iraf , namely subtracting a dark frame and dividing by a flat frame .",
    "the stokes @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters were created by subtracting two split images , in the standard approach for differential polarimetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". then , we calculated @xmath1 as @xmath23 shown in figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "@xmath1 images have been used by many researchers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as they have a significant advantage over the total intensity ( hereafter @xmath24 ) images due to difficulties with accurate reference psf subtractions .    since our focus is the @xmath1 rather than @xmath24 image of ab aur , it is first essential to demonstrate that the @xmath1 around ab aur does not produce any artificial structures",
    "for this purpose , the polarization vector pattern , and its azimuthal dependence is a good indicator of whether @xmath1 is affected by the bright central star .",
    "we calculated averaged azimuthal polarization profiles from a reference psf - subtracted @xmath24 image , using hd 282411 as the psf reference star .",
    "the reference star hd 282411 was observed just after the observations of ab aur and was observed in the same observation mode as ab aur . in the psf subtraction process , we searched for the best subtracted images in the various star - psf frames while varying the registration and scaling to minimize residuals .",
    "fig.[f3 ] shows the observed polarization vector ( the position angle as @xmath25 ) image of ab aur ( see the caption of fig.[f3 ] about the construction of the vector image ) and a histogram of the angles between the polarization vectors and lines from the stellar position to the vector position . the polarization vector pattern is a good indicator of whether the stokes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are affected by residual speckle noise of the bright central star",
    "this is because when the stokes @xmath21 and @xmath22 contain such noise , the polarization vectors show either random or parallel alignment . as a result of gaussian fitting in the histogram , we found that the central position and fwhm are 90.1@xmath26 0.2@xmath20 and 4.3@xmath26 0.4@xmath20 , respectively . since the polarization vectors are clearly centrosymmetric , we conclude that the residual speckle noise of ab aur is quite low and any features identified in our @xmath1 images ( the ring gap , dips , and peaks ) are real .",
    "fig.[f1 ] shows the @xmath1 image of ab aur covering a radial distance of 22 - 554 au ( @xmath2-@xmath27 ) . before discussing the inner region ,",
    "we compare the outer ( @xmath5 @xmath6140 au ) structures of our @xmath1 image and the @xmath24 image of previous observations @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the outer parts of these images is consistent at scales larger than the spatial resolution , although one is a @xmath1 image and the other is an @xmath24 image .",
    "these images trace the scattered light of the central star by dust grains near the surface of the disk because the disk is optically thick at infrared wavelengths .",
    "note , however , that the optically thin sub - millimeter continuum radiation also reveals some of the arms ; the spirals are not simply surface corrugation but also reflect the structures near the midplane of the disk @xcite .",
    "the real advantage of our new observations is that they allow investigation of the inner ( @xmath5 @xmath1050 au ) structure , comparable to our solar - system .",
    "fig.[f2 ] shows a magnified @xmath1 image of the inner part of ab aur and the associated azimuthal profiles .",
    "the inner regions of the disk exhibit complex , non - axisymmetric morphological structures .",
    "we summarize the significant features revealed in our @xmath1 images as follows :    \\(a ) we found two ellipse rings , as denoted in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the results of ellipse fitting .",
    "the position angles of the minor axes of these two rings are roughly consistent with the disk rotation axis inferred from co emission line kinematics ( 330@xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider the ellipse shape to be due to inclination @xcite ; the south - east side of the ring is inclined towards us @xcite .",
    "the difference of the inclination angles between the inner and outer rings suggests that the inner ring might be warped relative to the outer ring .",
    "in addition , we measured an offset of 0.@xmath319 @xmath13 0.@xmath301 between the geometric center of the outer ring and the central star .",
    "however , since the direction of this offset at the far side of the disk with 313.6@xmath20 @xmath13 5.1@xmath20 is roughly consistent with the disk rotation axis , this offset is most likely due to a geometric effect of the flared disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our detected double ring structure with a warp has not been reported in previous studies of ab aur @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) we found a wide ellipse ring - like gap between the two rings , as indicated in fig.[f2 ] ( hereafter the ring gap ) .",
    "the ellipse fitting results are also shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "this ring gap is barely seen in previous @xmath1 images @xcite .",
    "the far - side wall of the ring gap probably corresponds to the wall - like structure at 88 au inferred by mid - infrared observations @xcite .",
    "another example of a gap is hd 100546 @xcite , in which they inferred that this herbig be star has a disk gap around 10 au based on the infrared sed .",
    "interestingly , they also argued that ab aur has a prototype disk without a gap in the inner region .",
    "\\(c ) we found in total seven small dips in the @xmath1 within the two rings , which we refer to as dip a to g as shown in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "the typical size of the dips is @xmath745 au or less .",
    "the most prominent , dip a at @xmath7100 au , is consistent with those reported in the @xmath1 images of previous studies @xcite .",
    "dip a is confirmed at the 3@xmath28 confidence level in our @xmath24 image whose averaged azimuthal profile is shown in figs.[f2 ] .",
    "the detection of dip a in our @xmath24 image shows that the @xmath1 traces the @xmath24 pattern , and therefore , it is not solely a geometrical polarization effect as claimed @xcite .",
    "this detection also suggests that the @xmath1 image can be used to discuss even in the inner regions where the @xmath24 image is affected by speckle noise .",
    "this is especially true when discussing the `` local '' structures rather than the `` global '' structures that can be affected by the inclination of the disk .",
    "in addition , we found three @xmath1 peaks in close vicinity to the occulting mask , which we refer to as p1 to p3 in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "the peaks in the outer rings seen in our @xmath1 image are not labeled here for simplicity .",
    "all the peak structures are extended and thus not point sources .",
    "\\(d ) no point - like sources are detected in dip a in either the @xmath1 or @xmath24 images , as opposed to @xcite .",
    "our observations are consistent with @xcite .",
    "when we assume that a companion is 100 % polarized in the @xmath1 image , which is the faintest case as @xcite , the upper limits of its mass at 5@xmath28 ( the absolute magnitude of 11.7 at the @xmath16 band ) of the photon noise in dip a are 5 and 6 @xmath9 for an age of 3 and 5 myr , respectively @xcite .",
    "these derived upper limits of the masses are consistent with that of 1 @xmath9 inferred by the numerical simulations @xcite . on the other hand , our upper limits for point sources in the dips seen in the inner ring are 7 and 9 @xmath9 for these ages due to higher photon noise .",
    "the structures of ab aur s inner ( 22 - 120 au ) disk surface described above indicate that the disk is in an active and probably early phase of global evolution , and possibly one or more unseen planets are being formed in the disk .",
    "one possible explanation for the non - axisymmetric structures is gi of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if toomre s @xmath21-parameter ( defined as @xmath21 = @xmath29/@xmath30g@xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath31 are the sound speed , epicycle frequency , and surface density , respectively ) is of the order of unity , gi occurs and a mode with a small number of arms is excited , that is , a pattern of the surface density arises that may resemble what we have observed .",
    "however , this gi possibility may be rejected for ab aur ( at present ) because optically thin sub - millimeter observations indicate that toomre s @xmath21-parameter is of the order of ten @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the disk mass estimate from sub - mm emission has large uncertainties arising from the uncertainties in the optical properties of the dust particles .",
    "the presence of unseen planets in the disk can also result in perturbations which extend over the disk scale even in the absence of gi .",
    "a low - mass planet in a disk excites a spiral density wave that co - rotates with the planet @xcite , while a high - mass planet opens a gap in addition to the excitation of a spiral @xcite , thereby inducing a more significant , globally extended perturbation in the disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the review of disk - planet interaction ) .",
    "the gap opens when the amplitude of the perturbation caused by the embedded planet exceeds the order of unity .",
    "since the amplitude of the perturbation scales with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mass ratio between the planet and the central star and @xmath36 is the disk aspect ratio @xcite , a crude estimate of the gap - opening mass is @xmath37 . for the disk around ab aur ,",
    "the temperature of the disk at the location of the ring gap ( @xmath780 au ) is 20 - 30 @xmath38 @xcite , and therefore , the disk aspect ratio is expected to be @xmath70.1 .",
    "therefore , a planet with a mass of only @xmath71 @xmath9 ( consistent with the fact that we detected no point sources ) situated in the ring gap in the vicinity of dip a can form a gap at these distances .",
    "such a planet can not be directly seen if it is embedded in the disk equatorial plane ; however , its perturbation can induce the observed structures such as the ring gap and the largest dip a and is seen as `` shadows '' @xcite , while other peaks and small dips might be due to small perturbations .",
    "furthermore , a warp in the inner region may be explained by the gravitational perturbation from unseen planets @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that , there is a possibility that the inner ring is intrinsically elliptical due to the influence of an unseen gravitating object , which could be another indication of the presence of a planet @xcite . from the present data ,",
    "it is rather difficult to distinguish the cause of the elliptical shape of the inner ring : either a warped circular ring or an intrinsically elliptical ring .",
    "however , we consider that both possibility may be accounted for by at least one gravitating object embedded in a disk .",
    "the perturbation caused by an embedded planet generally tends to co - rotate with the planet , and therefore the deviation of the pattern speed from the local rotation speed would be smoking - gun proof of the existence of the planet .",
    "the pattern speed of the spiral structure is given by @xmath39 } ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the mass of the central star and @xmath41 is the orbital radius of the planet .",
    "such time variability can be observed for the next several years .",
    "we note that the existence of a planet in the ab aur system , whose age is only 3 - 5 myr , may pose a unique constraint on the planet - formation timescale because their formation via gas accretion have been considered to take about 10 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another intriguing explanation for the observed structure is magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "although global numerical simulations of mri is numerically challenging , some mri calculations show that perturbation may extend over the disk @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that mri drives the disk wind which causes a significant perturbation at the disk surface  @xcite . in this case , the timescale of variability is on the order of the local rotation timescale , which is longer than that caused by the inner unseen planet .    in summary , the fine structures including the double ring structure with a warp as well as the ring gap detected by our observations most likely have an origin in planetary perturbation , but gi or mri can also be a promising cause of the detailed structure",
    ". a key future investigation would be the detection of the time variability of the structures , which can provide clues for understanding the formation mechanisms of the wide - orbit companions discovered by direct imaging observations around a stars @xcite and a g star @xcite as well as a number of physical processes ongoing in the active protoplanetary disk .",
