    "over the past decade , there has been growing interest in the stochastic energetics of small systems .",
    "this interest is driven in part by the impressive experimental and technological progress in bio- and nano - technology . at the same time , the study of small scale systems has led to spectacular developments in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . brownian motors and refrigerators  @xcite , work and fluctuation theorems  @xcite , and stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite provide prominent examples of these developments . among the issues of specific interest",
    "are the thermodynamic properties of small scale stochastic systems and , in particular , the efficiency of interconverting different forms of energy . for classical heat engines ,",
    "a certain degree of universality has been identified for the transformation of heat into work .",
    "in particular , the efficiency @xmath3 at maximum power is found to be half of carnot efficiency in the regime of linear response  @xcite .",
    "this result has been illustrated by explicit calculations for several small scale engines  @xcite .",
    "however , many artificial and most biological engines operate in an isothermal environment .",
    "they transform one form of energy ( e.g. chemical or electrical ) into another form ( e.g. mechanical or optical ) .",
    "thermodynamics prescribes that the efficiency of this transformation is at most @xmath1 , a limit again reached for a reversible , hence zero - power transformation . concerning the efficiency at maximum power , it appears that there is again universality at the lowest order , i.e. , in the regime of linear response @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the so - called maximum power transfer theorem from electrical engineering  @xcite , enunciated by moritz von jacobi around 1840 : maximum power is achieved when the load resistance is equal to the source resistance , with corresponding efficiency equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the issue of universality beyond linear response is currently under debate  @xcite .",
    "the standard way to apply external work in statistical mechanics is to systematically move ( modulate ) energy levels or to modulate the potential energy .",
    "unfortunately , the analytic treatment of even the simplest case , namely , modulating a single energy level , appears to be extremely difficult , see for example  @xcite . the main purpose of this paper is to introduce an exactly solvable toy model which can be solved in full analytic detail , both in a classical and a quantum setting",
    ". we will call it the stochastic twin elevator .",
    "we present explicit results for the rates of work , heat and entropy production .",
    "the efficiency of conversion of external work into internal energy is found to vary between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for the case of a classical bath we also derive the analytic expressions for the large deviation functions  @xcite that characterize the statistics of the accumulated stochastic work , heat and internal energy and show that a heat fluctuation theorem is satisfied in the steady state .",
    "such an explicit calculation is the exception rather than the rule  @xcite .",

    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "a single particle , in contact with a heat bath , can reside in one of two available energy levels separated by a fixed energy gap equal to @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the temperature of the bath .",
    "thus @xmath0 is the energy in units of @xmath8 ; all energies will be expressed in these units .",
    "the levels are alternately and instantaneously raised at random times at a rate @xmath9 , while maintaining the fixed energy gap @xmath0 between them .",
    "when the particle occupies the level that is raised , the external agent must perform an amount of work equal to @xmath10 on the system .",
    "if the level that is raised is unoccupied , the external work is zero .",
    "note that this raising of the levels is a disturbance that drives the system away from equilibrium . due to its contact with the heat bath ,",
    "the particle can at any time make a thermal transition from the level it is occupying to the other level , absorbing from the bath ( if the transition is uphill ) or releasing to the bath ( for downhill transitions ) an amount of heat equal to @xmath0 . in this way , work and heat can be monitored . at the same time , the entropy produced in the process is known from stochastic thermodynamics , see below for more details .",
    "the technical simplicity of the stochastic twin elevator is due to the following mapping onto a 4-state markovian model .",
    "let us arbitrarily call one of the elevator levels  1 \" and the other  2 . \"",
    "the system can be in one of the four states @xmath11 , the first index indicating which state is the lower and the second indicating which state holds the particle .",
    "thus , for example , the state label @xmath12 means that level 1 is below level 2 , and that the particle occupies level 2 ( the higher one in this case ) .",
    "the system undergoes stochastic transitions between the four states . for example , lifting of the lower level in the state @xmath13 corresponds to a transition to the state @xmath14 , cf .",
    "[ fig : el_1 ] . similarly , if the particle in state @xmath13 makes a thermal jump to the other energy level , the state changes to @xmath12 .",
    "these transitions all take place randomly in time , so that the probability distribution vector @xmath15 with elements @xmath16 evolves according to the master equation @xmath17 the analysis of the properties of the system is thus reduced to matrix algebra involving a time - independent @xmath18 matrix .     thus changing the state from ( 1,1 ) to ( 2,1 ) . ,",
