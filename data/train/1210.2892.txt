    "recently , an alternative description of the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps)@xcite based on rotating highly magnetized and very massive white dwarfs ( wd ) has been proposed by malheiro , rueda and ruffini@xcite . in this new description several observational properties are easy understood and well explained as a consequence of the large radius of a massive white dwarf that manifests a new scale of mass density , moment of inertia and rotational energy in comparison with the case of neutron stars ( ns ) .    in the last years",
    ", two sgrs with low magnetic field were discovered , sgr 0418 + 5729 and swift j1822.3 - 1606 ( see n. rea et al.@xcite ) .",
    "this sources were found to have a period of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s respectively .",
    "these new astronomical observations challenged the magnetar model of sgrs where the large magnetic field is the source of the steady x - ray luminosity observed , and also responsible for the outbursts seen as the main characteristic of these type of pulsar .",
    "moreover , the characteristic age @xmath2 of these two magnetars are large with @xmath3 years , older comparing with all the others sgrs and axps @xmath4 years , an age usually seen as an indication for the association of sgrs / axps as young neutron star produced on supernova explosions .",
    "the magnetic field at the magnetic pole @xmath5 is related to the dipole magnetic moment by , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the star radius .",
    "if the star magnetic dipole moment is misaligned with the spin axis by an angle @xmath8 , electromagnetic energy is emitted at a rate ( see , e.g. , shapiro and teukolsky@xcite and references therein ) , @xmath9    thus , it is the magnetic dipole moment of the star , the physical quantity that dictates the scale of the electromagnetic radiated power emitted together with the angular rotational frequency .",
    "the fundamental physical idea of the rotation - powered pulsar is that the x - ray luminosity - produced by the dipole field - can be expressed as originated from the loss of rotational energy of the pulsar , @xmath10 associated to its spin - down rate @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the rotational period and @xmath13 is the momentum of inertia .",
    "thus , equaling eqs .",
    "( [ edot ] ) and ( [ erot ] ) we deduce the expression of pulsar magnetic dipole moment , @xmath14    from eq .",
    "( [ magnetic_moment ] ) we obtain the magnetic field at the equator @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath12 and @xmath11 are observed properties and the moment of inertia @xmath13 and the radius @xmath7 of the object model dependent properties .",
    "the model commonly addressed as magnetar@xcite is based on a canonical neutron star of @xmath17 and @xmath18 km and then @xmath19 @xmath20 as the source of sgrs and axps . from eqs .",
    "( [ moment ] ) and ( [ magneticfield ] ) , using the parameters above , we obtain the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic field of the neutron star , @xmath21 and @xmath22    for the case of the white dwarf model we use a radius @xmath23 km for all sgrs and axps and a mass @xmath17 , as recent studies of fast and very massive white dwarfs obtained ( see k. boshkayev et al.@xcite ) . thus , these values of mass and radius generating the momentum of inertia @xmath24 @xmath20 , will be adopt hereafter in this work as the fiducial white dwarf model parameters . using that parameters we obtain the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic field of the white dwarf pulsar , @xmath25 and @xmath26    the recent discoveries of sgr 0418 + 5729 and swift j1822.3 - 1606 with low magnetic field sharing some properties with the recent detected fast wd pulsar ae aquarii and rxj 0648.0 - 4418 , and the candidate euve j0317 - 855 is also discussed in this paper ( see table  [ ta1 ] ) , to support the wd description of sgrs and axps white dwarf pulsar .",
    "massive fast rotating white dwarfs with magnetic fields larger than @xmath27 up to @xmath28 has been observed@xcite .",
    "a specific example is ae aquarii , the first white dwarf pulsar , very fast with a short period @xmath29 s@xcite .",
    "the rapid braking of the white dwarf and the nature of pulse hard x - ray emission detected with suzaku space telescope in 2005 under these conditions can be explained in terms of spin - powered pulsar mechanism@xcite .",
    "although ae aquarii is a binary system with orbital period @xmath30 hr , very likely the power due to accretion of matter is inhibited by the fast rotation of the white dwarf .",
    "more recently , the x - ray multimirror mission ( xmm)-newton satellite had observed a white dwarf pulsar faster than ae aquarii .",
    "mereghetti et al.@xcite showed that the x - ray pulsator rx j0648.0 - 4418 is a white dwarf with mass @xmath31 and radius @xmath23 km .",
    "is one of the most massive white dwarfs currently known and the one with the shortest spin period @xmath32 s@xcite .",
    "that belongs to the binary systems hd 49798/rx j0648.0 - 4418 .",
    "as discussed by mereghetti et al.@xcite , the luminosity of @xmath33 erg / s is produced by accretion onto the white dwarf of the helium - rich matter from the wind of the companion . in this work , we do not consider the accretion model , instead we describe rx j0648.0 - 4418 as a rotation powered white dwarf , and obtain the magnetic dipole moment and magnetic field , using the above mentioned parameters of a fast rotating magnetized white dwarf .",
    "euve j0317 - 855 , a hydrogen - rich magnetized white dwarf discovered as an extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) source by the _",
    "rosat wide field camera _ and _ extreme ultraviolet explorer euve _ survey , is another observed wd pulsar candidates@xcite .",
    "however , relevant pulse emission from euve j0317 - 855 has not been observed yet , which may suggest that the electron - positron creation and acceleration does not occur ( see kashiyama et al.@xcite ) .",
    "barstow et al.@xcite obtained a period of @xmath34 725 s , which is also a fast and very magnetic white dwarf with a dipole magnetic field is @xmath35 g , and a mass @xmath36 which is relatively large compared with the typical wd mass @xmath37 .",
    "euve j0317 - 855 has a white dwarf companion , but is supposed to be no interaction between them , because of their large separation ( @xmath38 ua)@xcite .    in table",
    "[ ta1 ] we compare and contrast the parameters of these two sgrs with low b described in the white dwarf model with the three fast white dwarfs presented before .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment and magnetic field of all the sources are calculated using wd and ns fiducial parameters discussed above .",
    "we see from table  [ ta1 ] that several features of two sgrs with low magnetic field are very similar to the ones of fast and magnetic white dwarfs recently detected . they are old , characteristic ages of myr , low quiescent x - ray luminosity @xmath39 , magnetic field of @xmath40 g and magnetic dipole moments of @xmath41 emu .",
    "these results give evidence for the interpretation of sgrs / axps as being rotating white dwarf pulsars .",
    "the values for @xmath42 emu of the two sgrs with low b , are exactly at the same order of the three white dwarf pulsars observed ( see table  [ ta1 ] ) , and in the lower values of the observed isolated and polar white dwarf magnetic dipole moment range@xcite .",
    "the large steady x - ray emission @xmath43 erg / s observed in the sgrs / axps now well understood as a consequence of the fast white dwarf rotation ( @xmath44 s ) , since the magnetic dipole moment @xmath45 is at the same scale as the one observed for the very magnetic and not so fast white dwarfs .",
    "this supports the description of sgrs and axps as belonging to a class of very fast and magnetic massive white dwarfs@xcite perfect in line with recent astronomical observations of fast white dwarf pulsars .",
