    "inductive coupling @xcite is a conventional method to realize the near - field wireless power transfer ( wpt ) for short - range applications up to a couple of centimeters .",
    "recently , magnetic resonant coupling ( mrc ) @xcite has drawn significant interests for implementing the near - field wpt due to its high power transfer efficiency for applications requiring longer distances , say , tens of centimeters to several meters .",
    "the transmitter and the receiver in an mrc - wpt system are designed to have the same natural frequency as the system s operating frequency , thereby greatly reducing the total reactive power consumption in the system and achieving high power transfer efficiency over long distances .",
    "the mrc - wpt system with a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the literature for e.g. maximizing the end - to - end power transfer efficiency or the power delivered to the receiver with a given input power constraint @xcite . however , there is limited work on analyzing the mrc - wpt system under the general setup with multiple transmitters and/or receivers .",
    "the system with two transmitters and a single receiver or a single transmitter and two receivers has been studied in @xcite , while their analytical results can not be applied for a system with more than two transmitters / receivers . furthermore , to our best knowledge , there has been no work on rigorously establishing a mathematical framework to jointly design parameters in the multi - transmitter / receiver mrc - wpt system for its performance optimization .    in this paper , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eleccirtuit ] , we consider a point - to - multipoint mrc - wpt system , where one transmitter connected to a stable energy source sends wireless power simultaneously to a set of distributed receivers , each of which is connected to a given load .",
    "we extend the results in @xcite to derive closed - form expressions of the transmit power drawn from the energy source and the power delivered to each load , in terms of various parameters in the system .",
    "our results reveal a near - far fairness issue in the case of multiuser wireless power transmission , similar to its counterpart in wireless communication . particularly ,",
    "a receiver that is far away from the transmitter and thus has a small mutual inductance with the transmitter generally receives lower power as compared to a receiver that is close to the transmitter .",
    "we then show that the near - far issue can be optimally solved by jointly designing the receivers load resistances to control their received power levels , in contrast to the method of adjusting the transmit beamforming weights to control the received power in the far - field microwave transmission based wpt @xcite .    specifically , we first study the centralized optimization problem , where a central controller at the transmitter which has the full knowledge of all receivers , including their circuit parameters and load requirements , jointly designs the adjustable load resistances to minimize the total power consumed at the transmitter subject to the given minimum harvested power requirement of each load .",
    "although the formulated problem is non - convex , we develop an efficient algorithm to solve it optimally .",
    "then , for ease of practical implementation , we consider the scenario without any central controller and devise a distributed algorithm for adjusting the load resistances by individual receivers in an iterative manner . in the distributed algorithm",
    ", each receiver sets its load resistance independently based on its local information and a one - bit feedback shared by each of the other receivers , where the feedback of each receiver indicates whether the harvested power of its load exceeds the required level or not .",
    "finally , through simulation results , it is shown that the distributed algorithm can achieve close - to - optimal performance as compared to the solution of the centralized optimization .",
    "we consider an mrc - wpt system with one transmitter and @xmath0 receivers , indexed by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eleccirtuit ] .",
    "the transmitter and receivers are equipped with electromagnetic ( em ) coils for wireless power transfer .",
    "an embedded communication system is also assumed to enable information sharing among the transmitter and/or receivers .",
    "the transmitter is connected to a stable energy source supplying sinusoidal voltage over time given by @xmath3 , with @xmath4 denoting a complex voltage which is assumed to be constant , and @xmath5 denoting the operating angular frequency of the system .",
    "each receiver @xmath1 is also connected to a given load ( e.g. a battery charger ) , named load @xmath1 , with resistance @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitter and each receiver @xmath1 are compensated by series capacitors with capacities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath9 , with complex @xmath10 , denote the steady state current flowing through the transmitter .",
    "this current produces a time - varying magnetic flux in the transmitter s em coil , which passes through the receivers em coils and induces time - varying currents in them .",
    "we thus denote @xmath11 , with complex @xmath12 , as the steady state current at receiver @xmath1 .",
    "we denote @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) as the internal resistance and the self - inductance of the em coil of the transmitter ( receiver @xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "we also denote the mutual inductance between em coils of the transmitter and each receiver @xmath1 by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , where its actual value depends on the physical characteristics of the two em coils , their locations , alignment or misalignment of their oriented axes with respect to each other , the environment magnetic permeability , etc .",
    "for example , the mutual inductance of two coaxial circular loops that lie in the parallel planes with separating distance of @xmath19 meter is approximately proportional to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the receivers usually employ smaller em coils than that of the transmitter due to size limitations and they are also physically separated , we can safely ignore the mutual inductance between any pair of them .",
    "the equivalent electric circuit model of the considered mrc - wpt system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eleccirtuit ] ,    [ t ]     in which the natural angular frequencies of the transmitter and each receiver @xmath1 are given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , to ensure that the transmitter and all receivers have the same natural frequency as the system s operating frequency @xmath26 , named _ resonant angular frequency _ , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the transmitter and all receivers are at fixed positions and the physical characteristics of their em coils are known ; thus , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , are modeled as given constants .",
    "we treat the receivers load resistances @xmath30 , @xmath25 , as design parameters , which can be adjusted in real - time @xcite to control the performance of the mrc - wpt system based on the information shared among different nodes in the system via wireless communication .",
    "in this section , we first present our analytical results .",

    "_ admittance matrix_. let @xmath44 denote the element in row @xmath45 and column @xmath46 of @xmath47 .",
    "we simplify ( [ eq : v = zi ] ) as @xmath48^{t}v_{\\text{tx}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can also be shown that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 by substituting ( [ eq : b_mn ] ) into ( [ eq : simplified_v = zi ] ) , it follows that @xmath52 the power drawn from the energy source , denoted by @xmath53 , and that delivered to each load @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath54 , are then obtained as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the conjugate of @xmath57 . from ( [ eq : pl ] ) , it follows that the power delivered to each load @xmath1 increases with the mutual inductance between em coils of its receiver and the transmitter , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "this can potentially cause a near - far fairness issue since a receiver that is far away from the transmitter in general has a small mutual inductance with the transmitter ; thus , its received power is lower than a receiver that is close to the transmitter ( with a larger mutual inductance ) .",
    "we accordingly define @xmath59 as the sum ( aggregate ) power delivered to all loads , where we always have @xmath60 . in the following , we study impacts of changing the load resistance of one particular receiver @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath61 , on the transmitter power @xmath53 ,",

    "this result can be explained as follows . from ( [ eq : it1 m ] ) , it is observed that the transmitter current @xmath57 strictly increases over @xmath68 .",
    "hence , due to the fact that the energy source voltage @xmath69 is fixed , it follows that @xmath53 given in ( [ eq : pt ] ) strictly increases over @xmath68 .",

    "the above result can be justified as follows . from ( [ eq : ilm ] )",
    ", it follows that for each receiver @xmath76 , @xmath77 , its current @xmath78 strictly increases over @xmath68 .",
    "this is because @xmath57 increases with @xmath61 , and as a result , @xmath78 increases due to the mutual coupling between em coils of receiver @xmath76 and the transmitter .",
    "hence , the received power @xmath65 defined in ( [ eq : pl ] ) also strictly increases over @xmath68 . on the other hand",
    ", it follows from ( [ eq : ilm ] ) that for receiver @xmath1 , its current @xmath79 strictly decreases over @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , from ( [ eq : pl ] ) , it follows that the decrement in @xmath80 is smaller than the increment of @xmath61 when @xmath81 ; thus , @xmath62 increases with @xmath61 in this region , while the opposite is true when @xmath82 .",
    "[ prop:5 ] if @xmath83 , @xmath84 strictly increases over @xmath68 , where @xmath85 ; otherwise , @xmath84 first increases over @xmath86 , and then decreases over @xmath87 , where @xmath88    this property is a direct consequence of property 2 .",

    "for the purpose of exposition , we fix @xmath99 .",
    "we plot @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath25 , and @xmath66 , versus the resistance of load @xmath97 , @xmath100 , in fig .",

    "however , @xmath104 first increases over @xmath105 , and then declines over @xmath106 .",
    "these results are consistent with our above analysis . finally , we point out that changing @xmath100 not only affects @xmath107 , but also the power delivered to other loads .",
    "for instance , receiver @xmath97 can help receivers @xmath108 and @xmath98 , which are farther away from the transmitter , to receive higher power by increasing @xmath109 .",
    "this is a useful mechanism that will be utilized to solve the near - far issue .",
    "in this section , we optimize the receivers load resistances @xmath30 , @xmath25 , to minimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter subject to the given load constraints .",
    "we assume a central controller at the transmitter , which has full knowledge of the receivers , including their circuit parameters and load requirements , to implement the proposed centralized optimization .",

    "we also assume that the power delivered to each load @xmath1 should be higher than a certain power threshold @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we formulate the following optimization problem to minimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter . @xmath114 ( p1 ) is a non - convex optimization problem .",

    "since @xmath116 , @xmath25 , we have @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "we repeat the above procedure until ( p3 ) becomes feasible or @xmath126 .",
    "the following proposition summarizes the feasibility conditions for ( p3 ) .",

    "note that the obtained @xmath139 solves ( p1 ) optimally .",
    "to summarize , the algorithm to solve ( p1 ) is given in table 1 , denoted by algorithm 1 .",
    "in this section , we present a distributed algorithm for ( p1 ) , where it is suitable for practical implementation when a central controller is not available in the system . in this algorithm , each receiver adjusts its load resistance independently according to its local information and a one - bit feedback from each of the other receivers indicating whether the corresponding load constraint is satisfied or not .",
    "we denote the feedback from each receiver @xmath1 which is broadcast to all other receivers as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) indicates that its load constraint is ( not ) satisfied . in section [",
    "sec : performance ] , we show that the power delivered to each load @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath62 , has two properties that can be exploited to adjust @xmath61",
    ". first , @xmath62 strictly increases over @xmath143 , @xmath70 , which means that other receivers can help boost @xmath62 by increasing their load resistances .",
    "second , @xmath62 has a single peak at @xmath144 , assuming that other load resistances are all fixed .",
    "thus , over @xmath145 , receiver @xmath1 can increase @xmath62 by increasing @xmath61 ; similarly , for @xmath146 , it can increase @xmath62 by reducing @xmath61 . although receiver @xmath1 can not compute @xmath147 from ( [ eq : x_star ] ) directly due to its incomplete information on other receivers , it can test whether @xmath148 , @xmath144 , or @xmath146 as follows .",

    "it is observed that @xmath53 obtained by algorithm @xmath97 is lower than that by algorithm @xmath108 , while the gap is quite small , for all values of @xmath182 .",

    "in this paper , we study a point - to - multipoint mrc - wpt system with distributed receivers .",
    "we derive closed - form expressions for the input and output power in terms of the system parameters .",

    "for ease of practical implementation , we also devise a distributed algorithm for receivers to iteratively adjust their load resistances based on local information and one - bit feedback from each of the other receivers .",
    "we show by simulation that the distributed algorithm performs sufficiently close to the centralized algorithm with a finite number of iterations . as a concluding remark",
