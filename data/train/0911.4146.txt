    "consider a polygon @xmath1 in the plane , that could be simple or self - intersecting .",
    "pop _ operation is the reflection of a vertex , say @xmath2 , with respect to the line through its adjacent vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( as usual indexes are taken modulo @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 )  @xcite . observe that for the operation to be well - defined we need that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are distinct .",
    "this operation belongs to the larger class of edge - length preserving transformations , when applied to polygons  @xcite .",
    "it seems to have been used for the first time by millet  @xcite .",
    "if instead of reflecting @xmath2 with respect to the line through its adjacent vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the reflection is executed with respect to the midpoint of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the operation is called a _ popturn _ ; see @xcite .",
    "observe that both the pop and the popturn are single - vertex operations .",
    "each is an instance of a `` flip '' , defined informally , which has been studied at length .",
    "the most common variant of flip is the _ pocket flip _ ( or just _ flip _ ) , first considered by erds  @xcite .",
    "another variant is the _ flipturn _ , first considered by kazarinoff , and later by joss and shannon ; see  @xcite for an account of their results .",
    "in contrast with pops and popturns , both the flip and the flipturn may involve multiple vertices .",
    "the inverse of a pocket flip , called _ deflation _",
    ", has been also considered  @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe pocket flips and pocket flipturns next .",
    "assume that we deal with simple polygons in this paragraph .",
    "pocket _ is a region exterior to the polygon but interior to its convex hull , bounded by a subchain of the polygon edges and the pocket _ lid _ , the edge of the convex hull connecting the endpoints of that subchain ; see e.g. , @xcite . observe that any non - convex polygon has at least one pocket .",
    "a _ flip _ of a pocket consists of reflecting the pocket about the line through the pocket lid .",
    "instead , a _ flipturn _ of a pocket consists of reflecting the pocket about the midpoint of the pocket lid .",
    "observe that if @xmath0 is simple and non - convex , the polygons resulting after a pocket flip , or a pocket flipturn are again simple .",
    "it is known that within both of these variants , convexification can be achieved . more precisely : given a simple polygon , it can be convexified by a finite sequence of pocket flips  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it can be convexified by a finite sequence of pocket flipturns  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the first result continues to hold for self - intersecting polygons , under broad assumptions , see  @xcite . while the convexifying sequence can be arbitrarily long for pocket flips ( i.e. , irrespective of @xmath5 , the number of vertices ) , a quadratic number of operations always suffices in the case of flipturns  @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive bibliography pertaining to these subjects  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for more results on edge - length preserving transformations and chord stretching .",
    "in this paper we focus on pop operations .",
    "thurston gave an example of a simple polygon that becomes self - intersecting with any pop , see  @xcite .",
    "ballinger and thurston showed ( according to  @xcite ) that almost any simple polygon can be convexified by pops if self - intersection is permitted ; however no proof has been published .",
    "as ballinger writes in his thesis  @xcite , `` pops are very natural transformations to consider , but the analysis of polygon convexification by pops seems very tricky '' .",
    "it has remained an open problem whether there exist polygons that can not be convexified by pops  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open problem 5.3 ) .",
    "we show here that such polygons do indeed exist , from both classes , simple or self - intersecting , thereby answering the above open problem in its full generality .    in section  [ sec : alt ] , for every even @xmath7",
    ", we define a family @xmath8 of _ alternating polygons _ , and show that any polygon from this family can not be convexified by pop operations .",
    "this family contains simple , as well as non - simple ( i.e. , self - intersecting ) polygons , as desired .",
    "it is interesting that this family is closed under pop operations : any pop operation applied to a polygon in @xmath8 , at any vertex , yields a polygon in @xmath8 .",
    "recall that in order for the pop operation on a vertex @xmath2 be well defined , its neighbors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 need to be distinct , so that the reflection line through them is unique , hence the reflection of @xmath2 is also unique .",
    "a condition on the edge lengths of the polygon that guarantees this is that no two edges have the same length ; such a polygon is called _ scalene _  @xcite .",
    "a weaker condition that suffices is that no two consecutive edges have the same length ; we call such polygons _ weakly scalene_. our family of polygons @xmath8 we define below consists of weakly scalene polygons .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 coincide , @xmath2 is called a _ hairpin vertex _  @xcite . popping",
    "a hairpin vertex is undefined because there are an infinite number of reflection lines through @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our family of polygons is specifically designed to avoid any occurrence of hairpin vertices .",
    "see  @xcite for a possible adaptation of pops to hairpin vertices .",
    "let @xmath5 be even .",
    "fix a coordinate system in the plane .",
    "we say that a polygon @xmath9 with @xmath5 distinct vertices is _ alternating _ if its vertices lie alternately on the two axes : say , the vertices with _ odd _",
    "indexes on the @xmath10-axis , and the vertices with _ even _ indexes on the @xmath11-axis .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for an illustration .",
    "= 6.3 in    let @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 , and @xmath14 be two vectors in the positive orthant of @xmath15 , each having distinct nonzero coordinates , that is : @xmath16 let @xmath17 be a binary sign vector .",
    "consider the alternating polygon @xmath18 , where    * @xmath19 , for @xmath20 . * @xmath21 , for @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath8 ( @xmath23 ) be the family of all alternating polygons @xmath24 defined as above .",
    "first note that @xmath8 contains both simple , as well as non - simple ( i.e. , self - intersecting ) polygons .",
    "indeed , consider the polygon @xmath25 described next .",
    "let @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , for @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath30 is a simple polygon .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  [ f1 ]  ( right ) .",
    "consider now the polygon @xmath31 described as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 , for @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath33 is a self - intersecting polygon .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ]  ( middle ) .",
    "a sequence of pops executed on an alternating simple polygon with @xmath34 vertices appears in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .",
    "a key fact regarding alternating polygons is the following :    [ l1 ] if @xmath35 is convex , then @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath0 is convex , it intersects each of the coordinate axes in at most two points , unless it is tangent to one of the coordinate axes , and there are three consecutive collinear vertices on that axis .",
    "however this latter possibility would contradict the alternating property of @xmath0 .",
    "so the only alternative is the former , in which case we have @xmath36 .",
    "observe that the given inequality on @xmath37 can not be improved .",
    "the following properties are easy to verify :    1 .",
    "@xmath24 has @xmath38 distinct vertices .",
    "@xmath24 is weakly scalene .",
    "the pop operation applied to the vertex @xmath2 of @xmath24 , ( @xmath39 ) , yields @xmath40 , where @xmath41 differs from @xmath42 only in the @xmath43th bit .",
    "that is , the absolute value of the non - zero coordinate of @xmath2 remains the same , with the point switching to its mirror image with respect to the origin of the axes .",
    "in particular , this implies that the family @xmath44 is closed with respect to pop operations .",
    "let @xmath45 be fixed , with the above properties , and @xmath46 be two sign vectors .",
    "consider @xmath47 , and @xmath48",
    ". then @xmath49 can be obtained from @xmath0 by executing at most @xmath5 pops , via : for @xmath50 to @xmath5 do : if @xmath51 , then pop @xmath2 to @xmath52 .",
    "we are now ready to prove our main result :    [ t1 ] let @xmath12 , where @xmath53 .",
    "any polygon in the family @xmath8 is non - convexifiable by pop operations .",
    "consider a polygon @xmath35 .",
    "( we can choose @xmath0 simple , or self - intersecting , as desired . ) by lemma  [ l1 ] , @xmath0 is not convex .",
    "apply any finite sequence of pop operations . by the second property ( 2 . ) above , the resulting polygon also belongs to @xmath54 , and is therefore not convex .",
    "we have shown that there exists a family of polygons that can not be convexified by a finite sequence of pops .",
    "however , there exist many polygons that can be convexified in this way .",
    "we conclude with two questions :    1 .   what is the computational complexity of deciding whether a given ( simple or self - crossing ) polygon can be convexfied by a finite sequence of pops ?",
    "how hard is it to find a shortest sequence of pops that convexifies a given polygon ( assuming it is convexifiable in this way ) ?",
    "do good approximation algorithms exist for this problem ?",
