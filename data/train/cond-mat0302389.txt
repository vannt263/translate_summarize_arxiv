    "the interplay of disorder and strong correlations remains one of the least understood topics of contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "these effects are believed to bear relevance to many problems that have attracted recent attention , such as the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in two - dimensional electron systems.@xcite disorder effects are also likely to be important for the understanding of the puzzling non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior of several heavy fermion compounds .",
    "@xcite in some of these systems , impurities seem to play only a subsidiary role : the explanation for the anomalous behavior is more likely to be found in the physics of quantum criticality,@xcite even though a complete description is still lacking.@xcite however , in other heavy fermion systems , disorder seems to play a more essential role and seems to be at the origin of the nfl behavior.@xcite    several attempts have been made to address theoretically the role of disorder in heavy fermion compounds ( see an overview below ) .",
    "many experimental results can be described within the so - called kondo disorder model ( kdm)@xcite or , equivalently , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) of disordered kondo / anderson lattices,@xcite at least above the lowest temperatures .",
    "essential to this description is the consideration of the full distribution of local kondo temperatures @xmath0 . for sufficient disorder",
    ", it has a large weight as @xmath1 describing the presence of dilute low-@xmath0 spins that dominate the thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "however , the kdm / dmft predictions relied on a fine tuning of the bare disorder that suggested that a more accurate microscopic foundation was necessary . conspicuously missing in this scheme were fluctuations in the conduction electron local density of states ( dos ) , a quantity that is crucial for the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "this was remedied by two of us through a generalization of the dmft that incorporates such anderson localization effects while keeping its local treatment of correlations.@xcite as a result , the question of the extreme sensitivity to the bare disorder was solved .",
    "one important result of this study is the emergence of a power - law distribution of kondo temperatures @xmath2 , where @xmath3 depends continuously on the strength of disorder @xmath4 and decreases as @xmath4 is increased . as the distribution becomes more singular , several thermodynamic quantities become divergent , in a manner characteristic of griffiths phases.@xcite the system eventually localizes at a critical disorder strength @xmath5 .",
    "since there is no magnetic phase transition this has been dubbed an electronic griffiths phase .",
    "this initial work@xcite employed the slave boson large - n theory@xcite to solve the auxiliary single - impurity problems posed by the method . while versatile , powerful and yet computationally cheap , this approach presents some disadvantages , the main one being the difficulty of working at finite temperatures .",
    "it should be reminded that , since we deal with wide distributions of @xmath0 , we need to be able to describe well the full crossover from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , which is not possible with the slave boson large - n treatment . in particular , conspicuously missing are inelastic scattering processes . besides , though giving a good description of the low - energy fermi - liquid regime of the single - impurity problem , this treatment does not incorporate high- and intermediate - energy incoherent processes .",
    "another impurity solver is therefore needed to assess the importance of these intrinsically finite-@xmath8 and finite - energy features .",
    "a particularly useful method , able to fill this gap at a reasonable computational cost , is second order perturbation theory in @xmath9 .",
    "we have used this method to both complement and cross - check the slave boson results .    besides the results of the initial work,@xcite which have been confirmed by both methods , some of our main conclusions are : ( _ i _ )",
    "there is a subtle interplay between conduction and f - electron site disorder that leads to a surprising _ non - monotonic _ dependence of the conducting properties on disorder , a feature that is likely unique to kondo / anderson as opposed to hubbard models ; ( _ ii _ ) localization effects are essential for the determination of the distribution of kondo temperatures and a kdm / dmft description is clearly insufficient , especially if one starts from an experimentally measured discrete distribution ; ( _ iii _ ) the interplay between disorder and inelastic processes can lead to a temperature dependence of the conducting properties that is reminiscent of the ones found by mooij and others in several strongly correlated disordered metals.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the disorder - based mechanisms of non - fermi liquid behavior in the next subsection .",
    "section  [ sec : the - model ] describes the model of disordered anderson lattices we studied and the methods we employed to solve it .",
    "section  [ sec : slave - boson ] focuses on the detailed results obtained within the slave boson large - n method .",
    "this expands considerably on the previously published results.@xcite in section  [ sec : perturbation - theory ] , we show the results obtained with perturbation theory .",
    "finally , we wrap up with a general discussion of the strengths and limitations of this study and point out possible future directions in section  [ sec : discussion - and - conclusions ] . some details of the computational procedures are given in an appendix .",
    "the kdm was proposed early on to account for the temperature dependence of the cu nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) line widths in ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 ( @xmath12).@xcite it assumed that disorder in a heavy fermion system generates random spatial fluctuations of the exchange coupling constant @xmath13 between local moments and conduction electrons ( the kondo coupling ) .",
    "each local moment was assumed to undergo the kondo effect in a manner that is completely uncorrelated with the others and each with a characteristic energy scale , its kondo temperature @xmath14 .",
    "even narrow kondo coupling distributions lead to a wide distribution of kondo temperatures due to the latter s exponential dependence on the former . as a result , at low temperatures ,",
    "many spins are quenched while a few percent remain unquenched and dominate , giving rise to singular , nfl thermodynamic properties ( specific heat and magnetic susceptibility ) .",
    "the nmr results in ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are well described within this picture if the distribution function @xmath15 is such that @xmath16@xcite the kdm gained a natural theoretical setting within the dmft@xcite of a disordered anderson / kondo lattice.@xcite in this approach , each conduction electron site exchanges single particle excitations with an average `` cavity '' bath , which is in turn self - consistently determined .",
    "this treatment becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensionality and is the natural generalization of the curie - weiss mean field theory of magnets to a fermionic system .",
    "its treatment of disorder is equivalent to the well - known coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite in an anderson lattice description , the localized f - electron is hybridized with its adjacent conduction electron orbital and spatial fluctuations are preserved through the random distribution of hybridization strengths .",
    "the local moments are no longer independent since their distribution self - consistently determines the cavity bath . besides showing that the kdm corresponds to a rigorous limit of a microscopic hamiltonian , the dmft enabled the calculation of other properties such as the resistivity@xcite , dynamic magnetic susceptibility,@xcite optical conductivity@xcite and magneto - resistance,@xcite with good agreement with experiments . the non - fermi liquid behavior of these quantities hinged on the condition that @xmath16 subsequent experiments of muon spin rotation@xcite and nmr in high fields@xcite showed some inconsistencies with the kdm / dmft , suggesting that inter - site correlations , which are absent from that approach , may play a crucial role at the lowest temperatures . however",
    ", annealing studies have further emphasized that the consideration of disorder effects is indispensable.@xcite    despite its success , the kdm / dmft description suffered from a basic deficiency , which can be ascribed to its extreme sensitivity to the bare disorder distribution .",
    "indeed , the connection between the distribution of @xmath13 and the distribution of kondo temperatures is too rigid and a proper description always relies on fine tuning .",
    "in particular , discrete distributions of bare parameters can never generate a @xmath17 such that @xmath18 . likewise , power law distributions of @xmath19 are often necessary and it is not clear how they can be obtained within the kdm / dmft .",
    "more recently , two of us have pointed out that this can be solved through the inclusion of localization effects . from a basic theoretical point of view",
    ", the importance of this modification is unquestionable .",
    "disorder scatters the conduction electrons giving rise to spatial fluctuations in their wave function amplitude .",
    "these anderson localization precursor effects in turn give rise to fluctuations of the conduction electron local dos .",
    "the kondo temperatures are exponential functions of the local dos and will show a wide distribution for mild disorder strengths , _ even in the absence of fluctuations in @xmath13_.@xcite besides , direct experimental determination of the distribution of @xmath13 from x - ray absorption fine - structure ( xafs ) experiments in ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 have shown that additional conduction electron disorder is necessary for the interpretation of the results within the kdm / dmft.@xcite finally , the addition of localization effects has proved to be just the necessary ingredient for the elimination of the extreme sensitivity to the bare disorder and for a much more universal description .",
    "the average cavity bath of the dmft , however , completely neglects dos fluctuations and a more general treatment is necessary .",
    "progress could be made by means of the statistical dynamical mean field theory ( statdmft ) , which incorporates the full distribution of the conduction electron local dos , while keeping the treatment of local correlations already present in the dmft.@xcite the treatment involves solving a fully self - consistent loop : the f - electron fluid gives rise to an effective disorder potential for the conduction electrons , while the latter s dos fluctuations determine the distribution of kondo temperatures .",
    "we enumerate the main conclusions of our analysis:@xcite    * _ universality : _ the distributions of several physical quantities ( kondo temperatures , local dos of f- and conduction electrons , scattering t - matrices ) assume a universal log - normal form for weak to moderate disorder , irrespective of the form of the bare distribution .",
    "we have verified this for gaussian , square and discrete bare distributions of conduction electron on - site energies and hybridization strengths .",
    "this is in contrast to the kdm / dmft results and reflects the mixing of many different sites connected by the extended conduction electron wave function . *",
    "_ electronic griffiths phase _ : increasing the disorder generates wide @xmath0 distributions , leading to a griffiths phase with non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "this griffiths phase is not tied to any magnetic phase transition but is electronic in origin : it is generated by the precursors to the anderson localization transition . * _ metal - insulator transition _ : there is an anderson - type localization transition at a critical value of the conduction electron diagonal disorder . *",
    "_ non - monotonic conductivity as a function of the disorder _ : the typical conduction electron dos , which vanishes at the localization transition and serves as a measure of the conducting properties shows a counter - intuitive non - monotonic behavior as a function of disorder for a wide range of fillings .",
    "this surprising feature originates in the interplay between the bare and the f - electron disorder potentials and is tied to the proximity to the kondo insulating ( pseudo-)gap .",
    "an alternative theoretical scenario for disorder - induced non - fermi liquid behavior is the magnetic griffiths phase.@xcite in the vicinity of magnetic phase transitions disorder fluctuations induce rare regions with an enhanced local critical temperature .",
    "these large clusters are ordered on the scale of the correlation length and act as effective spins . though rare in occurrence they carry a considerable amount of magnetic entropy and the overall effect",
    "is the appearance of singular , thermodynamic responses .",
    "this magnetic griffiths phase picture has been advocated as a source of nfl behavior in disordered heavy fermion systems.@xcite however , very recent results seem to point to several difficulties encountered when this scenario is applied to experimental systems , as follows .    _",
    "the entropy problem . _",
    "the amount of magnetic entropy observed experimentally in most disordered heavy fermion systems seems much too high to be compatible with the magnetic griffiths phase picture .",
    "taking the measured specific heat of , say , ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 , we estimate that about 5% of the sample would have to participate in the spin-@xmath20 clusters .",
    "this implies an average cluster separation of @xmath21 lattice constants , ruling out cluster sizes exceeding this distance .",
    "these small clusters suggest instead that the `` unquenched '' localized moments of the kdm / dmft or the electronic griffiths phase offer a much more natural explanation .    _",
    "effects of dissipation .",
    "_ other important limitations of the magnetic griffiths phase scheme have also been emphasized in recent work by millis , morr , and schmalian,@xcite who have carefully examined the effects of dissipation caused by the metallic bath .",
    "this work suggests that the dissipation caused by itinerant electrons is so pronounced that quantum tunneling of even moderately sized magnetic clusters will be suppressed .",
    "although the emergence of a magnetic griffiths phase is a well established phenomenon in disordered _ insulating _ magnets , this result seems to bring into question its relevance to itinerant systems .      finally , another possibility is to invoke the proximity to a spin glass quantum phase transition .",
    "several theoretical schemes predicting non - fermi liquid behavior in the vicinity of a spin - glass quantum critical point have been proposed.@xcite spin glass phases have been identified in the phase diagram of some heavy fermion alloys ( ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 , for @xmath22)@xcite and structurally disordered compounds ( urh@xmath23ge@xmath23).@xcite more interestingly , evidence of glassy dynamics _ in the absence of freezing _ at very low temperatures has been seen in ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25)@xcite and ce(ru@xmath26rh@xmath26)@xmath23si@xmath23,@xcite with conflicting results pointing to a very low freezing temperature in ucu@xmath27pd@xmath28.@xcite these experiments seem to suggest that , if there is a true spin glass transition , freezing temperatures are _ strongly suppressed _ in a wide portion of the phase diagram .",

    "proximity to the insulator implies large , random , almost unitary scattering potentials . as a result , metallic coherence is efficiently destroyed and the typical conduction electron dos is strongly suppressed.@xcite the important role played by the unitary scatterers was emphasized in refs .   and , where the distribution @xmath123\\right)$ ]",
    "was directly computed and its weight at @xmath124 was shown to correlate with the destruction of coherence .",
    "there is another equivalent way of understanding these effects .",
    "for small dopings away from the kondo insulator , carriers are introduced at the _ edges _ of the valence or conduction bands defined by the kondo insulator gap , which have a small dos ( in the bethe lattice , band edges have a square root shape as in three dimensions ) .",
    "as has been known for a long time , a region of small dos is particularly sensitive to localization effects introduced by disorder .    as in the previous case , further increase of disorder acts to wash out the nearby kondo pseudo - gap and",
    "the behavior then becomes very similar to the disordered kondo insulator .",
    "we thus have a region with a rather non - intuitive increasing @xmath106 , which can be ascribed to the proximity to the kondo insulator fixed point .",

    "[ cap : fig1 ] for @xmath125 .",

    "this figure also illustrates the non - trivial nature of the self - consistency .",

    "the self - consistently determined solutions of the impurity problems effectively help _ screen _ the conduction electron disorder .",

    "this is precisely the disorder value where the minimum of @xmath106 occurs ( cf .",
    "[ cap : fig1]a ) and which we have been ascribing to the presence of many unitary scatterers due to the nearby kondo insulator .",
    "the similarity between the two distributions strengthens further our case for the importance of the proximity to the kondo insulator .",
    "additionally and consistent with this , the divergence is totally absent at @xmath142 , where the role played by the kondo insulator fixed point is much less important .",
    "it is also interesting to observe in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig3]c , how the kondo gap is washed out by disorder : at @xmath146 , where @xmath106 peaks ( fig .",
    "[ cap : fig1]a ) , most of the weight of the distribution is already at sizeable values of the dos and its shape is very similar to the metallic cases .",
    "we now proceed to the analysis of the physical properties related to the ensemble of impurity problems .",
    "as shown before@xcite the distribution of kondo temperatures of the various f - sites is log - normal for weak disorder , but broadens and acquires a power - law shape at intermediate values of @xmath147 .",
    "once this power - law becomes singular enough , a griffiths phase is entered with diverging thermodynamic responses.@xcite      we have noticed that for weak disorder , the shape of the distribution of various quantities , including the kondo temperature , is universal , irrespective of the shape of the bare distribution of disorder .",
    "a nice illustration of this effect is given by the case where the bare disorder is a _ discrete _ distribution .",

    "we also include in the figure the results of the kondo disorder model@xcite ( kdm ) ( vertical dashed lines ) , which is very similar to the dmft .",
    "the only differences between the kdm and the dmft are that , in the former , no self - consistency is imposed and a kondo instead of an anderson lattice model is used .",
    "the difference between the results of the kdm / dmft and the statdmft is striking .",
    "the fluctuations of the conduction electron wave functions incorporated in the statdmft smooth out the discrete results of the dmft into a universal continuous form",
    ". a description of the nfl behavior within the kdm / dmft theory would be clearly impossible .",
    "this comparison also shows that this level of hybridization disorder alone is not able to generate non - fermi liquid behavior _ even in statdmft _ , since the distribution of kondo temperatures goes to zero as @xmath149 , a point that was stressed in refs .",
    "however , if disorder in the conduction electron sites , @xmath150 , is also included a singular behavior can be obtained ( not shown ) .",
    "the inclusion of conduction electron disorder is reasonable in ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11 , since the cu - pd interchange affects both @xmath39 and @xmath38 .      in order to identify the emergence of the griffiths phase ,",
    "we next study the evolution of the distribution of kondo temperatures as the width @xmath4 of @xmath40 is varied ( with no disorder in @xmath126 ) .",
    "typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig5 ] , corresponding to @xmath151 . as the disorder increases ,",
    "we find that the overall width , but most significantly , the size of the low-@xmath0 tail rapidly grows .",
    "these tails assume a _ power - law _",
    "form @xmath152 , with the power @xmath153 being a monotonically decreasing function of disorder . once again , this behavior can not be obtained in the rigid scheme of the kdm / dmft without unjustified fine tuning .",
    "the thermodynamic response of the system assumes a singular , non - fermi liquid form as soon as @xmath154 , which happens for sufficiently strong disorder @xmath155 .",
    "since this behavior does not reflect any thermodynamic phase transition , it assumes the character of an electronic griffiths phase . here",
    ", singular behavior emerges due to the presence of exponentially rare events ( in our case kondo spins ) which nevertheless provide an exponentially large contribution to thermodynamic and transport properties and thus dominate the macroscopic behavior of the system .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of the exponent @xmath3 can be easily obtained by fitting the tails of these distributions ; a representative behavior for several values of the chemical potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig6 ] .      in the previous section",
    "we have seen how the proximity of the kondo insulator plays a crucial role in determining the disorder dependence of the localization and transport properties , and leads to the surprising `` bad metal '' behavior for a wide parameter range .",
    "this was argued to reflect the enhanced sensitivity to disorder of those electronic states that are very close to the kondo insulator , and which are most easily affected by localization effects .",
    "we have also established that nfl behavior also emerges as a result of disorder - induced density of states fluctuations .",
    "it is then natural to ask how sensitive this emergence of nfl behavior is to the proximity to the kondo insulator , which in the clean limit emerges only in a narrow parameter range , close ( in our case ) to @xmath156 .    to address this question ,",
    "we have systematically investigated the evolution of @xmath157 as a function of the distance to the kondo insulator , i.e. as a function of the chemical potential @xmath113 . the behavior for weak disorder ( @xmath158 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig7 ] . despite what one would naively expect , these result",
    "clearly demonstrate that the distributions are the broadest _ far _ from the kondo insulator .",
    "as we can see on this figure , the distributions narrow down as the kondo insulator is approached from either side . as a result",
    ", we may expect that the critical disorder strength @xmath159 necessary for the emergence of nfl behavior should _ increase _ closer to the kondo insulator .",
    "this surprising result is confirmed by examining the @xmath113-dependence of the exponent @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig6 ] .",
    "as we can see there , for a given @xmath4 , the exponent @xmath3 is indeed _ smaller _ , and @xmath159 decreases for larger @xmath113 ( far from the kondo insulator ) .    at first sight , these findings seem in contradiction to what one may expect , since we have found that the typical density of states decreases close to the kondo insulator .",
    "naively , one could then expect the kondo temperatures to be depressed as well , leading to broader distributions and enhanced nfl behavior . on the other hand , we know that the kondo temperature remains _ finite _ within the kondo insulator , despite the fact that the density of states at the fermi energy vanishes there .",
    "although surprising at first sight , this curious feature of kondo insulators is at present well understood .",
    "it is called the `` strong coupling kondo effect''.@xcite it reflects the fact that the kondo screening is not determined only by electronic states precisely _ at _ the fermi energy , but also by all the states in an energy interval of order @xmath0 around the fermi energy . indeed , the average value of the kondo temperature ( see fig .  [",
    "cap : fig7 ] ) is the _",
    "highest _ precisely near the kondo insulator . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the value of the kondo temperature is determined by a certain weighted average of the density of states over this extended energy interval . when localization is present ,",
    "only the states closest to the kondo gap band edge will be appreciably affected , but since not only those states determine @xmath0 , the net effect is washed away .",
    "we thus conclude that the proximity to the kondo insulator , in contrast to transport , does not have appreciable effect on the emergence of the nfl behavior .",
    "indeed , the critical value of disorder @xmath159 required for the emergence of nfl behavior is found to have a remarkably weak @xmath113 dependence .      at strong disorder",
    "we expect the density of states fluctuations to completely wash out any trace of the kondo gap , and in addition to broaden the conduction band , making it very flat and featureless . as a result",
    ", all quantities are expected to have an extremely weak @xmath113 dependence , leading to a more universal behavior of all quantities .",
    "such behavior is indeed seen at sufficiently strong disorder , where the typical dos curves ( fig .  [ cap : fig1 ] ) are seen to merge around @xmath160 .",
    "similar behavior is seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig8 ] , which shows @xmath161 for different @xmath113 s at @xmath146 .",

    "this is a remarkable example of universality generated by dos fluctuations , completely absent in the kdm / dmft treatment .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig10]a the distribution of its imaginary part calculated at the chemical potential ( @xmath164 ) .",

    "( [ eq : kondotemp ] ) , which is thus very sensitive to it .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig10]a that its distribution is very regular and retains a bell - shaped structure for any @xmath4 .",
    "it also inherits the non - monotonic behavior observed in the conduction electron local dos ( cf .",

    "it is tempting to try to calculate the distribution of kondo temperatures from the distribution of @xmath165 $ ] , by naively applying the kondo temperature formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kondotemp ] ) .",
    "this procedure fails , however : the actual distribution of @xmath0 has much lower weight at small @xmath0 values than is predicted by the kondo temperature formula .",
    "the explanation for this failure lies in the fact , already alluded to before , that @xmath0 is determined by a weighted average of @xmath166 $ ] over a region around the fermi level .",
    "this can be glimpsed from the strong frequency dependence of the _ typical _ ( geometric average ) hybridization function close to the chemical potential , as shown , for frequencies on the real axis , in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig10]b .",
    "it shows a robust and well - defined pseudo - gap , inherited from the nearby kondo insulator , and a tiny narrow peak at the chemical potential .",
    "this narrow peak is easy to understand : spatial fluctuations due to disorder give rise to narrow peaks within the pseudo - gap , most typically at the chemical potential . however , as we have remarked before , the kondo temperature can be finite _ even if the density of states is zero or almost zero at the chemical potential_.@xcite in this case , the spectral weight right at the chemical potential is unimportant for the determination of the kondo temperature .",
    "it is dominated by a whole range of spectral density away from the fermi level .",
    "since far from the pseudo - gap region the density of states is much larger and hence much less affected by the spatial fluctuations , the distribution of kondo temperatures is narrower than one might guess based on the distribution of @xmath165 $ ] and the kondo temperature formula .    when considered together , the results of section  [ sec : slave - boson ] show the importance of a self - consistent solution of the problem , with a non - trivial interplay between spatial fluctuations due to localization and strong correlation effects",

    "we call attention to the slave boson results of fig .",
    "[ cap : fig2 ] , which similarly show that a decrease of the hybridization strength moves the `` dip - hump '' feature to smaller disorder values .",

    "the presence of disorder in @xmath180 generates a distribution of @xmath0 , as we have seen before .",

    "this is a difficult task in the present scheme , however , although an approximate calculation can be performed , which becomes accurate close to the localization transition.@xcite it requires the calculation of the propagator between two different sites , which goes beyond our current method , whose focus is on local green s functions only . even in view of all these caveats , however , it is tempting to use the inverse typical dos as an approximate measure of the resistivity , _ specially far from the weakly disordered region _ ( @xmath196 ) . if this is done , then the fanning out of the `` resistivity '' curves of fig .",
    "[ cap : fig17 ] as @xmath197 is reminiscent of the mooij correlations,@xcite originally observed in disordered transition metal alloys , but which are also seen in heavy fermion alloys,@xcite doped kondo insulators@xcite and even in two - dimensional systems as in the metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors.@xcite our results and the discussion above show that the interplay between localization effects and electron - electron interactions can give rise to the mooij correlations , without the need to invoke other sources , such as electron - phonon interactions.@xcite in addition , we have pointed out how the rapid drop in the typical dos is a consequence of the proximity to the kondo insulator , a region where localization effects are particularly large .",
    "taken together , these observations point to a close connection between mooij correlations and localization effects in the vicinity of a kondo or a mott insulator .",
    "it would be interesting to test these ideas by a direct calculation of the resistivity within a scheme capable of incorporating both localization and strong correlations .",
    "finally , regarding the dmft calculation presented in all the figures discussed in this section , we note that the results obtained for @xmath178 $ ] fall approximately in the region where the concentration of realizations in the statdmft calculation is largest .",
    "there is no reason to expect dmft and the statdmft to give similar results , except at weak disorder .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that , surprisingly , dmft can serve as a rough guide for the most probable values of @xmath178 $ ] .",
    "there is a sizeable discrepancy , however , between the dmft and the statdmft results for @xmath195 $ ] at the highest temperature ( @xmath167 ) and low disorder .",
    "the dmft line in this case is an underestimate of the realizations obtained within the statdmft . as the temperature",
    "is lowered a better agreement is obtained .",
    "thus , besides its inherent neglect of localization effects , dmft should be used only as a lower bound when gauging the importance of inelastic processes in disordered anderson lattices .",
    "we have in this paper extensively characterized the physics of disordered anderson lattices within the statdmft scheme , which is able to incorporate both localization effects and the local correlations coming from electron - electron interactions .",
    "this was done using both large - n methods and perturbation theory for the auxiliary single impurity problems .",
    "these are in a sense complementary approaches . on the one hand ,",
    "large - n theory is ideal for ground state properties , where inelastic effects are absent . in particular",
    ", it affords a quick and reliable way of calculating kondo temperatures ( with the correct exponential dependence ) and scattering phase shifts at @xmath79 . without @xmath198 corrections , however , it is unsuitable for a finite temperature calculation . on the other hand ,",
    "second order perturbation theory has the advantage of being equally flexible with the added bonus of incorporating inelastic processes and the temperature dependence of the scattering phase shifts .",
    "nevertheless , it fails to capture the exponential nature of the low temperature scale of the single impurity problem . taken together ,",
    "the two methods have enabled us to put on firm grounds the conclusions laid out in previous work,@xcite namely , the emergence of an electronic griffiths phase in anderson lattices governed by the proximity to the disorder - induced localization transition . in particular , several inadequacies of the early kondo disorder model ( and its formulation as a dynamical mean field theory ) have been given a better theoretical basis once localization effects were included . the self - averaging effect introduced by the spatial fluctuations of the conduction electron wave functions induce a much higher degree of universality than is possible in the rigid kdm description .",
    "furthermore , the perturbation theory treatment has also suggested a mechanism behind the ubiquitous observation of mooij correlations in the resistivity of disordered materials .    even within the confines of the approximations of the statdmft scheme ,",
    "there are still outstanding issues that we would like to resolve .",
    "even though a fully analytical treatment is probably impossible , it might be feasible to devise an approximate parameterization of the statdmft on the bethe lattice , specially at weak disorder . in this respect ,",
    "the universality of the distributions of `` dressed '' quantities , such as the various local green s functions and the kondo temperatures , which are either gaussian or log - normal is a useful guide .",
    "a `` toy '' model that assumes a simple form for the distribution of @xmath199 can be written down , which recovers the griffiths singularities obtained in the numerical treatment.@xcite this `` toy '' model may prove useful for a calculation of the resistivity and for generalizations of the statdmft treatment .",
    "on the other hand , a specially important effect neglected in the statdmft is two - particle inter - site correlations , particularly in the spin channel .",
    "indeed , the proliferation of poorly quenched low-@xmath0 spins in our treatment generates a large amount of entropy that must be relieved at low temperatures through inter - site correlations .",
    "indeed , experimental evidence in favor of spin - glass dynamics at low temperatures in ucu@xmath10pd@xmath11@xcite and urh@xmath23ge@xmath23@xcite makes the inclusion of inter - site correlations more pressing .",
    "a promising avenue of attack would be to remain true to the spirit of the dmft and use its extended version .",
    "several treatments along these lines have been attempted.@xcite the challenge in our case is to incorporate both the dynamical inter - site correlations of the latter treatments _ and the spatial fluctuations of kondo temperatures of the electronic griffiths phase we find in our approach_. we defer the discussion of this problem to a future publication .",
    "we thank m. j. rozenberg for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank c. h. booth for providing us his xafs data .",

    "the set of stochastic equations defined in  ( [ eq : siteaction]-[eq : bath2 ] ) must be solved in two steps .",
    "first , action ( [ eq : siteaction]-[eq : siteactionhyb ] ) is solved with the bath function with @xmath64 nearest neighbors defined in ( [ eq : bath2 ] ) .",
    "this determines self - consistently the distribution of local conduction electron green s functions with one nearest neighbor removed @xmath200 .",
    "next , the same action ( [ eq : siteaction]-[eq : siteactionhyb ] ) is solved , this time with the bath function in ( [ eq : bath ] ) , constructed from the previously determined @xmath67 .",
    "this step involves no self - consistency and yields the distribution of @xmath201 as output .",
    "since the latter bath function is a sum over @xmath51 nearest neighbors its statistical fluctuations are reduced compared to the former one .",
    "thus , @xmath201 is more narrowly distributed than @xmath67 .",
    "yet , we expect the qualitative behavior to be the same .",
    "we have therefore focused on the first step of the procedure only .    for a given impurity solver ,",
    "this disordered bethe lattice problem was solved for @xmath202 , by sampling the distribution of @xmath203 from an ensemble of @xmath204 sites , as proposed originally in ref .  .",
    "we have generally used @xmath205 since we have checked that the results do not change by taking @xmath206 .",
    "we have thus determined the distribution of various local properties .",
    "the equations were solved on a discrete mesh along the matsubara axis .",
    "the mesh is set by the matsubara frequencies in the perturbative treatment at finite temperatures and by an arbitrary finite discrete mesh in the slave boson mean field theory at @xmath79 ( up to 32000 points ) .",
    "the choice of the imaginary frequency axis is due to a greater numerical stability .",
    "when the disorder is strong , the various green s functions show large fluctuations . however , these are much more pronounced on the real frequency axis , where they give rise to several peaks and gaps .",
    "the slave boson treatment consists in finding the two mean field parameters @xmath82 and @xmath81 by solving the set of two non - linear eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sb1b]-[eq : sb2b ] ) . for that",
    ", we used the powell hybrid method .",
    "the integrals were calculated with standard adaptive quadrature routines . since we used a finite frequency mesh , it was important to extrapolate the value of @xmath207 with the asymptotic form @xmath208 for values of @xmath209 greater than the largest mesh value . in this fashion , a wide range of kondo temperatures",
    "is covered , going down to almost machine precision in the clean metallic case .",
    "when disorder is present a given impurity problem may not have a solution even at @xmath79 , because the strong spatial fluctuations may cause the local dos to vanish at the fermi level . in this case",
    ", there are two possible regimes for the impurity , which have been carefully analyzed.@xcite the analysis shows that there is a critical coupling constant @xmath210 such that the ground state is a singlet for @xmath211 ( the so - called `` strong coupling kondo effect '' ) , whereas the local moment remains unquenched if @xmath212 .",
    "when a solution could not be found , this corresponded to either a free spin ( @xmath212 ) or a kondo temperature which is smaller than the smallest value we can reach with our numerical code . in either case , we set @xmath213 , effectively decoupling the free moment from the rest of the lattice .",
    "yet , we were still able to span several decades of energy scales .    in the perturbative treatment , the solution of each impurity problem is found by solving a set of two non - linear equations for @xmath214 and @xmath215 , which is defined by eqs .",
