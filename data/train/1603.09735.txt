    "each polytope @xmath8 defines a @xmath6-parameter family @xmath9 of @xmath0 surfaces given by the affine equation @xmath10    recently , ishige @xcite has made a research on the family @xmath11 derived from the polytope @xmath12 in ( [ polytope ishige ] ) .",

    "there , he noticed that his monodromy group is isomorphic to the extended hilbert modular group for @xmath13 .",
    "inspired by ishige s research , we study the other families @xmath14 @xmath15 . among them , the family @xmath16 is especially interesting , for this is related to the hilbert modular orbifold for the field @xmath3 . in the classical theory of the elliptic functions and the gauss hypergeometric differential equations ,",

    "we can find an analogous story on our family @xmath16 : the period differential equation for @xmath16 is the uniformizing differential equation of the hilbert modular orbifold for @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as the following .    in section 1",
    ", we give explicit defining equations for the families @xmath14 @xmath15 of @xmath0 surfaces and elliptic fibrations for them .    in section 2",
