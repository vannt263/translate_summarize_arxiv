    "the study of black hole collisions has been of recent interest in connection with the development of gravitational wave detectors@xcite , and as a proving ground for numerical relativity@xcite .",
    "in addition , it will give unprecedented insights into the nonlinear workings of relativistic gravitation in strong field situations .",
    "the approach in numerical work has usually been to use the prescription of bowen and york@xcite to generate initial data representing the holes . in this prescription , the initial value problem is greatly simplified by the assumption that the initial geometry is conformally flat .",
    "this approach , though , has some disadvantages for studying collisions with net angular momentum , since the final hole formed will be a kerr hole , and  at least for standard slicings  the spatial geometry of a kerr hole is not conformally flat .",
    "this means that computations of radiation from coalescence will contain early radiation due to the relaxation of bowen - york holes to kerr holes , as well as radiation more directly attributable to the coalescence itself .",
    "still , this represents an astrophysical imperfection rather than a major obstacle to numerical work . for analytic work , however , it is useful to consider initial configurations close to the final stationary hole so that the initial configuration , and the evolution , can be treated with perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "this technique is inherent in the methods used for extraction of radiation @xcite in full numerical relativity .",
    "first and second - order perturbation theory have also been remarkably successful in the `` close limit approximation , '' the analysis of collisions starting from small separations@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an approach to the generation of initial data that fits the needs of perturbative analysis .",
    "since this approach has essentially the same computational simplicity as that in the conformally flat approach , it is our hope that these solutions will be considered as starting points for numerical relativity evolution . in recent work",
    ", comparisons@xcite between analytic and numerical results have been very helpful to both efforts .    within the context of a more general formalism",
    ", we will present two families of initial data solutions .",
    "the first family of solutions will represent an axisymmetric superposition of two equal mass kerr holes , parameterized by the mass of each hole and the spin of each hole , and a measure of the separation between them .",
    "the solution will have the crucial feature that the holes have local `` kerricity . ''",
    "that is , in a region around each hole small compared to the spacing between the holes , the 3-geometry and extrinsic curvature will have the form of the kerr initial data , aside from corrections that vanish in the limit of infinite separation .",
    "the specific solution given serves to illustrate a method of superposition which can be generalized in an obvious way to a large number of axisymmetric initial configurations .",
    "in particular , it can be used to construct initial data for unequal ( different mass , different spin ) kerr holes , for more than two holes , for a collection of kerr and bowen - york spinning holes , or for a collection of bowen - york holes ( although in this last case the method involves only conformally flat geometries and is equivalent to the bowen - york method ) . for any solution constructed by this method",
    "the hole will locally have the same form as if it were isolated .",
    "a very important feature of these solutions is their close limit .",
    "if we reduce the separation between two holes , an initial horizon will surround both holes , but in the limit of small separation the solution outside that horizon is not a single kerr hole .",
    "this is very different from what happens for nonrotating holes , and this difference is one of the major points we wish to make in this paper .",
    "the fact that the kerr geometry is not the `` natural '' close limit for a sequence of initial data sets for two locally kerr holes is not a flaw in our superposition method , but is to be expected for general initial data sets .",
    "the fact that the close limit of rotating holes is not a kerr hole is surprising because it is so very different from the schwarzschild case . for initial value solutions for two nonspinning holes , such as the solutions of misner@xcite or of brill - lindquist@xcite ,",
    "if the separation between the holes is reduced one expects an all - encompassing horizon to exist on the initial hypersurface , and for the initial value solution outside that initial horizon to approach the schwarzschild geometry . and",
    "this is just what happens@xcite . in the mathematics , as in intuition , the only source of nonsphericity is the separation of the initial holes , and as that separation is reduced , the solution outside the event horizon becomes spherical , and hence becomes schwarzschild initial data .",
    "crucial to the simplicity of this process is the fact that the schwarzschild initial data is singled out by the requirement of sphericity .",
    "the kerr initial solution , by contrast , requires much more : a set of relationships involving the initial extrinsic curvature as well as the initial 3-geometry .",
    "if these relationships are satisfied for the individual holes , there is no reason for them to be satisfied by the superposition of two holes .",
    "one can see a rough quantitative sign of this in the following . for a rotating hole of mass @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath1 ,",
    "the quadrupole moment in the 3-geometry has a magnitude of order @xmath2 .",
    "if we add two such holes we expect to infer from the distant geometry that we have approximately twice the mass , twice the the angular momentum , and ( from the @xmath3 part of @xmath4 ) twice the quadrupole moment .",
    "the quadruple moment will therefore be too small by a factor of two for the result to be a kerr hole . in a manner of speaking , then , what makes two kerr holes different from a single hole is not simply the separation , it is the more basic fact that there are two of them .",
    "there is a completely different point of view from which this can be understood .",
    "the kerr solution is singled out as a spacetime geometry with a stationary horizon . the initial value solution  the 3-geometry and extrinsic curvature  are not special as initial value solutions . by contrast , the initial value solutions for schwarzschild ( spherical 3-geometry , zero extrinsic curvature ) is special .",
    "we are pointing out here that the kerr close limit should not be expected from the superposition of two kerr holes .",
    "this should not be confused with the fact that the kerr geometry is the natural late time result for the _ evolution _ of two holes .",
    "due to the evolution , the geometry and extrinsic curvature on a late hypersurface , outside the final horizon , will have approximately kerr form .",
    "for that reason , it is useful to have solutions available with a kerr close limit .    in sec.iii below we construct such a solution .",
    "this solution is somewhat contrived , but any other multihole solution with a kerr close limit will also be contrived ( except of course , the solution produced by evolution ) .",
    "our particular contrived solution has the unappealing feature that there is a singularity where there should not be a physical reason for a singularity .",
    "since this contrived solution is meant to be used only for small separations , in which case this singularity will be well inside the horizon surrounding the two initial holes .",
    "in judging the importance of this singularity , it is necessary to keep in mind the use to which the close - limit solution is to be applied . for this initial value solution ( or any other initial value solution with a kerr close limit ) it is possible to use close - limit perturbation theory to find the outgoing radiation generated in the evolution of the initial data .",
    "if these initial data are used for numerical relativity , very useful comparisons with analytic results are possible . for such comparisons",
    "the unwanted singularity is of concern only if it causes problems in the numerical method . for numerical relativity computations that use horizon",
    "excision the singularity should be of no concern whatever .",
    "an alternative approach has recently been given by baker and puzio@xcite to the construction of initial data sets for axially symmetric non - conformally flat , initial data .",
    "that method starts with a specification of the 3-geometry and solves for partial information about the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the method has the advantage , in principle , of allowing generalization to a broader class of axisymmetric solutions , in particular to rotating holes which are initially moving .",
    "the method has the disadvantage that it is more difficult to implement , and has not yet been tested numerically .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the basic method of superposition , and the numerical solution for two identical `` locally kerr '' holes , including a numerical demonstration of local kerricity . in sec .",
    "iii we show that the locally kerr solutions of sec .",
    "ii do not have a kerr close limit , and we introduce solutions that do have a kerr close limit .",
    "a discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we start with the brill - wave@xcite form of the metric , as studied by brandt and seidel @xcite . in place of their radial coordinate @xmath5 which is appropriate to the description of both sides of a throat , we use the alternative coordinate @xmath6 , related to @xmath5 by @xmath7 . in terms of this coordinate , and the brandt - seidel notation , the form of the metric is @xmath8\\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath9 and the conformal function @xmath10 are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",

    ", the deviation from the kerr geometry is significantly larger , on the order of 12% .",
    "yet smaller values of @xmath110 produce yet larger deviations from the kerr geometry .    for definiteness",
    "we have described the axisymmetric superposition of two equal mass , equal spin , kerr holes , but it should be clear that the method of superposition is more widely applicable to the axisymmetric superposition of solutions . the general principle is to put the initial value solutions to be added into the form ( [ genmet ] ) .",
    "the individual metric @xmath9 functions and extrinsic curvature @xmath18 functions are then superposed as in ( [ supers ] ) , and the momentum constraint ( [ momcon ] ) is guaranteed to be satisfied . the last step is to choose the singularities , and ( numerically ) to solve the hamiltonian constraint for @xmath37 . this can be done , for an arbitrary axisymmetric array of kerr holes , but the method is not limited to kerr holes . any solution that can be put in the form ( [ genmet ] ) can be superposed .",
    "in particular , the rotating holes of the bowen - york@xcite formalism can be used as building blocks . for these conformally flat solutions , @xmath111 , and superposing _ only _ bowen - york holes will lead to a conformally flat initial value solution ; in this case our method is simply a special case of the more general superposition that is valid in the bowen - york formalism . more interesting is the possibility of superposing arbitrary mixtures of bowen - york and kerr holes , or kerr holes with distorted kerr holes .",
    "for solutions constructed by superposition as described above , the close limit is not a single kerr hole . in the two kerr hole solution , for example ,",

    "[ figure - i ] , the left ( small radius ) boundary of the surface is at the approximate location of the initial horizon .",
    "as one would expect , the plot in ( b ) shows that the maximum deviation from the kerr geometry ( around 8% ) occurs on the horizon .",
    "the crucial feature of these plots is that _ they do not change significantly as @xmath121 . _",
    "the close limit of the two holes is not a single hole ; the deviation from the kerr geometry exhibited in part ( b ) does not decrease with decreasing separation .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the nonrotating case , in which the deviation outside the horizon , decreases monotonically with the separation of the holes .",
    "there are two very different reasons for wanting a solution with a single - kerr close limit .",
    "the first is that the evolution of a binary system will result in a single kerr hole as the evolved close limit , so we might want an initial value solution with this feature .",
    "( this will be discussed further in the next section . ) of more practical interest , if we are to do close - limit perturbation theory , we must have a simple stationary solution as the close limit .",
    "it is , in fact , very simple to construct a superposition with the desired close limit .",
    "we can take the metric function @xmath9 and the conformally related extrinsic curvature functions @xmath18 to be precisely those of a single kerr hole of mass and spin @xmath122 , i.e. , the functions given by ( [ qkerr ] )  ( [ hfkerr ] ) and ( [ rdef ] ) . we could then try to impose the topology of two throats by taking @xmath40 to have the two - throat form of ( [ blfor2holes ] ) . but in this case , the righthand side of ( [ hamforphireg ] ) would have a @xmath123 singularity at @xmath124 , if @xmath125 were finite there , since @xmath78 does not vanish at @xmath124 .",

    "since this is numerically inconvenient , we have chosen to keep the @xmath126 singularity as a part of @xmath37 , and to use the boundary condition for ( [ hamforphireg ] ) that @xmath133 is regular at @xmath124 .",
    "an alternative is for us to choose to add a term of the form @xmath134 to @xmath40 . for any value of @xmath49",
    "this will cause the extrinsic curvature term on the righthand side of ( [ hamforphireg ] ) to vanish at @xmath124 .",
    "of course , by adding such a term to @xmath40 , we are adding another asymptotically flat region , i.e. , another throat .",
    "our solution , then can be taken to represent an `` extra '' black hole .",
    "we could minimize the intrusiveness of this unwanted additional throat by choosing @xmath49 , the parameter that governs its size , to be arbitrary small . in this case , at small @xmath6 the extrinsic curvature term in ( [ hamforphireg ] ) will become very large , of order @xmath135 around @xmath136 .",
    "if we are to use the above choices of topology , either the @xmath137 , or @xmath138 , at @xmath124 , we no longer have the two throat topology that represents two holes .",
    "but if this superposition is to be made only in the case the two holes are quite close , the additional central topological feature will be deep inside an all - encompassing horizon , and will be irrelevant to close - limit analysis or for numerical relativity if horizon excision is used . as we shall argue further in the next section",

    "the initial location of the horizon is indicated .",
    "these plots demonstrate that outside the horizon @xmath10 approaches the kerr form as the separation between the throats ( i.e. , between the singularities in @xmath40 ) is reduced .",
    "the solutions deep inside the horizon are very different , as they must be , no matter how small the separation .",
    "as explained above , for these choices there will be a formal singularity at @xmath141 corresponding to a @xmath128 feature .",

    "ii we presented solutions that accurately describe two kerr holes in the far separation limit . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will show that , with very little additional complexity , these close and far limit solutions can be combined .",
    "to simplify the description of how this is done , we will confine attention to the case of two identical holes , of parameter @xmath142 and angular momentum @xmath143 , symmetrically placed at @xmath144 , as in the examples of sec .",

    "the functions with @xmath27 subscript are the `` pure '' kerr functions from ( [ qkerr])([hfkerr ] ) . for the mixed solution",
    "we take the function @xmath40 to have the form @xmath157    for separations large enough so that a horizon does not enclose both holes , the solution , is identical to the solution of sec .",
    "i , and therefore has the correct far limit , i.e. , in the limit of large separation the solution near each throat approaches that of an isolated kerr throat . for @xmath158 , the mixing function @xmath159",
    "approaches 0 , and the solution approaches the kerr solution , and hence the mixed solution must have the correct close - limit , i.e. , in the limit of small separation the solution outside the horizon approaches that of a single kerr hole .",
    "it is interesting to note that our sequence of solutions , with mass and the angular momentum the same at large and at small separations , can not produce a rapidly rotating final hole ; for extreme individual holes , with @xmath160 , the final hole has @xmath161 .",
    "if we want a close limit final hole that is rapidly rotating we can not use a constant - mass , constant - angular momentum sequence .",
    "this reminds us that simply adding rotating holes does not automatically produce something of physical relevance , or at least , does not produce what we may want .",
    "this is a point we will be coming back to in the next section .",
    "we have presented a general method for constructing axially symmetric superpositions of kerr black holes .",
    "the crucial feature of this method is the adoption of a 3-metric form , that of ( [ genmet ] ) , with which the momentum constraint for the conformally related extrinsic curvature reduces to a linear equation , independent of the 3-geometry . in this limited sense ,",
    "the approach has the simplicity of the bowen - york@xcite conformally flat approach .    in the case of sizeable separation between the superposed holes ,",
    "the method produces holes with `` local kerricity , '' and has the advantage of great simplicity and easy numerical implementation .",
    "the method has been illustrated with numerical results for two equivalent ( equal mass , equal spin ) holes , but many extensions are possible .",
    "it should be clear how to superpose any number of holes with `` local kerricity , '' or holes without local kerricity , in particular locally bowen - york holes .",
    "a crucial feature of our superposed solutions is that their close - limit is _ not _ a single kerr hole outside the horizon .",
    "we have argued that unlike the spherically symmetric case , it should be expected on physical grounds that two locally kerr holes , no matter how close they are , will not superpose into a single kerr hole .",
    "though the `` failure '' of the close limit is physically correct , it is inconvenient .",
    "we would like to do close limit perturbation theory , which will at the very least be of value for checking numerical codes for colliding rotating holes .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the _ correct _ close limit data for two holes , is the data produced by the evolution of a pair of holes falling into each other .",
    "a guess at what that initial data solution is , has little chance of being accurate .",
    "this was true , of course , also for initial data solutions representing nonrotating black holes , but in that case the variety of choices was small , and the radiation evolving from the close limit initial data seemed to be rather insensitive to the choice of details .",
    "this is very unlikely to be the case for rotating holes ; here the richness of the geometry and extrinsic curvature gives a much greater scope of choices .    for the reasons",
    "just given , our focus is on close limit calculations as a check on numerical relativity calculations , so definitiveness and simple implementation are of importance .",
    "we have given , in sec.iii , an alternative superposition scheme , which is very easily implemented , and which has the correct close limit , but it has a singularity at the midpoint between two equal holes .",
    "that singularity will be hidden deep inside the horizon of a close limit solution , and is of concern only for numerical relativity methods that require a solution throughout the interior of the horizon .",
    "the presence of the singularity does not in any way suggest that the solution outside the horizon is a good or bad representation of the late stage of infall of two kerr holes , or whether the radiation produced outside the horizon is for any reason a good or bad test of numerical relativity .    having the singularity hidden inside the horizon means of course , that this type of initial data is only applicable in the close limit . since it may be useful to have a sequence of solutions which includes both large and small separations , we have also given , in sec.iii , a method of mixing both types of superpositions so that for large separations one has locally kerr holes and no spurious singularities , and in the close limit one approaches a single kerr hole , and has a spurious singularity hidden inside the horizon .",
    "we intend to use the close limit , and mixed - sequence , initial data solutions as a starting point for close limit computations of radiation .",
    "we have already converted the superposition solutions , in the close limit , to cauchy data for the teukolsky equation@xcite and will be evolving a number of examples . with the technical tools in place to do studies of evolution to a rapidly rotating hole",
    ", we will be able to answer a number of interesting questions , such as the range of validity of the slow rotation limit ."
