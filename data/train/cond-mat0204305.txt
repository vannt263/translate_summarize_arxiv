    "there is some evidence that @xmath43 stays flat down to smaller @xmath46 for larger @xmath47 , although the range of sizes is too small to make a reliable extrapolation .    as with the distribution of @xmath46 ,",
    "there is a pronounced peak at large @xmath10-values in the distribution of @xmath8 for the 3d gauge glass .",
    "note also the appearance of a smaller peak at smaller @xmath10 for larger system sizes , as predicted by rsb .",

    "to conclude , i have studied the properties of the 3d gauge glass and the 4d @xmath0 spin glass at low temperatures . for both models , the order parameter distribution @xmath7 has , in addition to a peak , a tail that seems to extend for smaller values of @xmath9 and whose height seems to persist as the system size increases .",

    "the log - log plot for @xmath55 for the @xmath0 spin glass shows curvature , possibly indicating a non - zero value in the thermodynamic limit , a result compatible with rsb . due to the small range of system sizes , however , i can not rule out the possibility that @xmath72 at large @xmath47 , which is compatible with the kmpy scenario or droplet picture .",
    "the effects of vortices in the spin glass phase still remain to be understood",
