    "better measurements or upper limits on a plethora of rare ( semi)leptonic and radiative @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson decays in forthcoming experiments , compared to precise standard model ( sm ) predictions , eventually will provide indirect indications of heavier particles with new interactions . particularly sensitive for np searches are those decays dominated by short - distance ( sd ) dynamics where the hadronic uncertainties are well under control .",
    "conversely , precise measurements of these rare decays , combined with non - observation of np effects , will furnish a better determination of flavor mixing parameters .",
    "very recently , the lhcb collaboration has reported a deficit in the ratio of muon to electron pairs produced in @xmath8 decays , in the @xmath9 gev@xmath5 region for the squared invariant - mass of the lepton pair @xcite .",
    "this energy region is cleverly chosen as it excludes long - distance ( ld ) contributions associated to charmonium and light vector resonance production in @xmath10 decays followed by their conversion to lepton pairs ( for definiteness , hereafter we will focus on decays of negatively charged @xmath7 mesons , unless otherwise indicated ) .",
    "the measured ratio @xmath11 @xcite , if confirmed in more refined measurements , would call for lepton universality violating interactions since in the sm @xmath12 @xcite for the energy region reported by lhcb @xcite .",
    "possible explanations involving np interactions have been suggested as the source of non - universal leptonic interactions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , other anomalies have been reported in angular observables of related @xmath13 decays @xcite which have been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .    in the sm ,",
    "the semileptonic @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) decays are dominated by the sd @xmath16 transition @xcite .",
    "this elementary process is induced by the electromagnetic and weak penguin ( figure 1a ) , as well as @xmath17 boson box ( figure 1b ) diagram contributions , which are dominated by loops involving the top quark . in these exclusive processes ,",
    "ld chiral corrections to the hadronic matrix element have been computed for soft momenta of light pseudoscalars ( i.e. high - momentum @xmath18 of dilepton pairs ) , where they amount to rather large @xmath19 corrections @xcite .",
    "our point here is that , although this kind of corrections will be much smaller on the other energy end ( large recoil region for the heavy - to - light b - meson form factors @xcite ) , the high precision of measurements as well as the sharp predictions of the dominating sd contributions suggests ld effects associated to resonance dynamics at the gev scale be taken into account as well for these more energetic @xmath20 mesons .",
    "contributions of four - quark operators giving rise to tree - level wa amplitudes with virtual photon emission are also possible for exclusive @xmath14 processes and are the main concern of this paper .    as far as we know , the one - photon exchange feynman diagrams ( arising from wa operators ) shown in figures 1c-1d provide a so far neglected ld contribution that must be included in the calculation of these exclusive semileptonic rare decays . neutrino - exchange amplitude .",
    "this one was checked to give a highly suppressed effect in @xmath21 decays @xcite . ]",

    "rare semileptonic decays are dominated by the one - photon exchange contributions analogous to the ones of figure 1c and 1d ; the sd top - quark loop penguin and w - box contributions in that case are negligible small @xcite . owing to gauge - invariance",
    ", this ld contribution vanishes at lowest order in chiral perturbation theory but this is not the case at higher orders @xcite .",
    "according to the respective ckm mixing factors in the sd and ld amplitudes of @xmath14 decays , one can envisage a correction at the percent level for @xmath24 but a slightly higher effect could be expected for @xmath25 depending on the limits of the integrated observables .",

    "hadronic recoil ( corresponding to low values of the squared virtual photon momentum @xmath30 ) , the light - meson energy ( @xmath31 ) is much larger than the energy scale of hadronic binding : @xmath32 .",
    "then , the virtual photon exchange between the hadrons and the dilepton pair and hard gluon scattering can be systematically expanded in powers of @xmath33 using qcdf .",
    "however , the @xmath34 amplitude suffers from nonperturbative corrections due to @xmath35 and @xmath36 intermediate states , which form the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , ... resonances @xcite ( similarly , in @xmath40 processes @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be excited and the @xmath43 meson plays a prominent role @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a clean qcdf prediction shall be limited to an energy range which excludes these resonant contributions , conservatively @xmath44 gev@xmath5 .    on the contrary",

    "there are , however , other resonance contributions that may be relevant in our case : the ones where the photon is attached to the initial and final state mesons in wa contributions ( fig . 1c-1d ) .    in the spirit of the phenomenological lagrangians",
    ", we would like to focus in the @xmath50 gev@xmath5 region by adding the effect of the lowest - lying light - flavoured resonances and pseudoscalar mesons as active degrees of freedom as it is done in the ( resonance ) chiral lagrangians .",
    "this is the approach that we follow to ensure the applicability of the qcdf analysis of the @xmath51 decays down to threshold . here we treat the photon - meson interaction by considering the exchange of resonances in the framework of two different models which have shown to give a very accurate description of experimental data for @xmath49 values up to @xmath52 gev@xmath5 .",
    "this agreement shows that up to those energies , the photon does not resolve the quark structure of mesons and only probes their electromagnetic structure . in order to avoid potential double counting of effects from wa contributions ( in the qcdf approach and ours )",

    "the wa contribution that we study has a different dependence on ckm mixing elements than the dominant sd one and also carries a sizable strong phase , leading to possible cp violating effects .",
    "the dominant source of cp violation , both in our paper and in the qcdf approach , arises from the interference between the sd top - mediated loop and the wa diagrams .",

    "since @xmath143 drops by 6 orders of magnitude in going from the peak to @xmath142 gev ( see figure 3 ) , it should be sufficient to include only the @xmath116 resonance in its parametrization .",

    "clearly , the integrated rates in the whole kinematical range would exhibit a trivial breaking of leptonic universality owing to the lower electronic threshold and its enhancement due to the @xmath151 dependence in the ld wa amplitude .",
    "however , this will happen both in the well - known qcdf as well as in the new ld wa contributions ; thus only the numerical evaluation will tell if there is any additional measurable breaking of universality due to ld wa effects in the considered processes .",
    "the ld ( one - photon exchange ) contribution to the @xmath14 decays that we have discussed in previous sections and the one evaluated in the qcdf approach originate from the wa four - quark operator of the effective hamiltonian .",

    "the qcdf expansion in 1/@xmath31 is the best way to organize the perturbative series .",
    "however , when approaching the @xmath35 threshold ( @xmath152 ) light - resonance effects need to be included explicitely as active degrees of freedom in the action as done in the resonance chiral lagrangians . within the interval from threshold to @xmath153",
    ", we expect that chiral lagrangians give an adequate description for low @xmath49 values , while qcdf be more appropriate for the higher @xmath49 region .",

    "we have used this separation scale between the ld and sd ( qcdf ) descriptions of wa contributions in the following and a slight variation of the matching scale has been taken into account in the error estimates . in the following , whenever we use qcdf",

    "interestingly , the different weak and strong phases of the qcdf and ld wa ( one - photon exchange ) contributions are capable to generate a cp asymmetry . again , this cp asymmetry is large in the case of a pion in the final state for @xmath172 gev@xmath5 values of the lepton - pair invariant mass , but also sizable and worth to measure in the @xmath173 gev@xmath5 interval . for the kaon case ,",
