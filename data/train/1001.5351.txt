    "in the even - even isotopes of actinides and also in the heavy ba and ce isotopes the low - lying negative parity states are observed together with the usually presented collective positive - parity states combined into rotational or quasirotational ground - state bands .",
    "the formation of the positive - parity rotational or quasirotational bands are connected in general to the quadrupole collective motion , while the lowering of the negative - parity states is a signature of the presence of the reflection asymmetric collective mode .",
    "there are several approaches to treat the collective motion related to the reflection asymmetric degrees of freedom .",
    "one of them is based on the concept of the nuclear mean field @xcite which has a static mirror asymmetric deformation or is characterized by a large amplitude of reflection asymmetric vibrations around the equilibrium shape .",
    "another approach is based on the assumption that the reflection asymmetric shape is a consequence of the @xmath3-clustering in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is also known from the nilsson - strutinsky type calculations for light nuclei that nuclear configurations corresponding to the minima of the potential energy contain particular symmetries which are related to certain cluster structures @xcite .",
    "several calculations performed for heavy nuclei @xcite have shown that configurations with large equilibrium quadrupole deformations and low - lying collective negative parity states are strongly related to clustering .",
    "we mention also a different approach to description of the properties of the alternating parity bands which is based on the idea of the aligned octupole phonons @xcite    the main idea of the cluster model developed in @xcite is that a dynamics of a reflection asymmetric collective motion can be treated as a collective motion of nucleons between two clusters or as a motion in a mass - asymmetry coordinate .",
    "such collective motion simultaneously creates deformations with even and odd - multipolarities . among different cluster configurations only @xmath3-cluster system @xmath4he gives a significant contribution to the formation of the low - lying nuclear states . within this approach the existing experimental data on the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting and multipole transition moments ( e1,e2,e3 ) of the low - lying alternating parity states in odd and even actinides @xmath5ra , @xmath6ac , @xmath7th , @xmath8pa , @xmath9u and @xmath10po and the medium mass nuclei @xmath11ba , @xmath12pm , @xmath13ce @xmath14eu and @xmath13nd",
    "are well described .",
    "the perfect agreement between the calculated results and experimental data supplies the proof of the cluster features of reflection - asymmetric states .",
    "however , in our previous publications we have considered in the even - even nuclei only the low - lying collective negative parity states with @xmath1=0 . however , there are experimental data which indicate a presence of the low - lying collective states related to the reflection - asymmetric modes which are characterized by nonzero values of @xmath1",
    ". it can be also that @xmath1 is not a good quantum number if nuclei are located in a transitional region between deformed and spherical ones .",
    "a good example is @xmath0th @xcite whose energy spectra is a challenge for the theoretical approaches .    to describe the properties of the low - lying collective states related to the reflection - asymmetric collective mode and characterized by nonzero values of @xmath1 in the framework of the cluster approach we should take into account intrinsic excitations of the clusters forming a nucleus under consideration .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a formulation of a simple model which gives a quantitative description of the low - lying positive and negative parity bands in the spectra of nuclei like @xmath0th .",
    "our model is based on the assumption that the collective oscillations of the nuclear shape lead to the formation of the cluster - type configurations .",
    "this model is further development of the previously used approaches @xcite .",
    "the choice of the collective coordinates and the procedure of the calculation of the potential energy and of the inertia coefficients for the hamiltonian of the model are based on the concept of the dinuclear system ( dns ) .",
    "the concept of the dinuclear system was first introduced to explain the experimental data on deep inelastic and fusion reactions . later on it",
    "was applied to the description of the nuclear structure phenomena , like alternating parity bands , mentioned above , and superdeformed states @xcite .",
    "the dinuclear system ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) consists of two fragments ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 sticked closely together by a molecular - type nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "the degrees of freedom needed to describe the collective excitations of such a system are related to the rotation of the dns as a whole , to the relative motion of the dns fragments , to the intrinsic excitations of the fragments , and to the transfer of nucleons between the dns fragments .",
    "the latter process is described usually by means of the mass - asymmetry coordinate @xmath23 or by charge - asymmetry coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "the idea that the motion in mass - asymmetry is responsible for the formation of reflection - asymmetric deformations of the medium mass and heavy nuclei is based on the observation which manifest the alpha - cluster dinuclear system for these nuclei .",
    "our calculations have shown that the potential energy for the alpha - cluster dns are close or even lower than the binding energy for these nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is also in agreement with the fact that these nuclei are good alpha - emitters .",
    "previously , we considered the mass - asymmetry motion variable as the only intrinsic collective coordinate describing dns .",
    "however , the nuclei demonstrate yet another sign of reflection - asymmetry , namely , low - lying ( started below 1 mev ) negative parity rotational bands with @xmath250 which can be related to the non axially - symmetric reflection - asymmetric mode .",
    "the natural way to obtain such an excitation in the framework of the dinuclear system model is to consider the relative angular motion of the fragments in the dinuclear systems illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . it is the aim of the present investigation to extend the dns model to take into account such excitations .",
    "basically , there are two physically different cases which can be distinguished .",
    "if the heavy fragment of dns , whose lighter fragment is an @xmath3-particle is strongly deformed , the light fragment is tend to stay near the pole of the heavy cluster performing the small angular oscillations around this position .",
    "this case which holds for the heavy actinides is considered in the work [ ] .",
    "if the heavy fragment is nearly spherical , the interaction between the fragments is small to prevent the light cluster from rolling along the surface of the heavy one .",
    "such a case is realized in the light isotopes of actinides , including the @xmath0th considered here .",
    "the structure of @xmath0th has been analyzed in several theoretical publications @xcite . here",
    ", we apply an approach of the dinuclear system model .",
    "the degrees of freedom chosen to describe a system with nearly spherical heavy cluster are related to the rotation of the dns as a whole , to the quadrupole oscillations of the heavy fragment , and to the transfer of nucleons between the fragments .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model can be presented in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 describes independent fragments of the system and @xmath28 describes the interaction between the fragments .",
    "are defined by the angles @xmath29 with respect to the laboratory frame system._,height=8 ]    [ fig1 ]    we assume that the heavy cluster is spherical and perform harmonic quadrupole oscillations around the spherically symmetric shape with frequency @xmath30 , while the light cluster stays in its ground state . then for @xmath27 we have the following expression @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the reduced mass of the dns , @xmath33 is the distance between the centers of mass of the fragments , @xmath34 is the operator of the number of the quadrupole phonons of heavy cluster and @xmath35 is the operator of the square of angular momentum of relative rotations of the two fragments @xmath36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    angles @xmath37 ( see fig.1 ) describes the orientation of the relative distance vector * r * with respect to the laboratory system .",
    "taking into account that for the low angular momenta the deformation of heavy fragment is small , the interaction between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom can be taken in the lowest order with respect to the operators of quadrupole deformation @xmath38 @xmath39\\cdot y_2\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we express the operator of quadrupole deformation through the creation and anihillation operators of bosons @xmath40 with @xmath41 .    in this work",
    "we does not consider the transfer of nucleons in the dns explicitely .",
    "instead , we assume that the system stays in its lowest state in mass - asymmetry coordinate .",
    "the reason for such an assumption is that the energy of @xmath3-particle dns is around 1 mev higher than the binding energy of @xmath0th .",
    "the first excited state in mass - asymmetry will appear high enough to neglect its influence on the low - energy part of the spectra . instead of considering the mass - asymmetry motion",
    "we take the effective value of mass - asymmetry @xmath42 in our calculations .",
    "this value , which must be at least in the interval @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mass - asymmetry for dns with alpha - particle , is fixed by the description of the lowest 1@xmath45 state .",

    "experimental values are taken from @xcite._,height=9 ]    [ fig5 ]    the dependence of experimental and calculated values of parity splitting in the ground and the first negative parity bands , treated as a unified alternating parity band , on angular momentum is illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "the parity splitting is defined by the expression @xcite @xmath100 it is seen from the figure that for the low angular momenta the parity splitting is positive and becomes negative with angular momentum increase . the possibility for the negative values of the parity splitting",
    "is related to the fact that the ground - state band and the first negative parity band are of the vibrational type . in this case",
    "the sign of the parity splitting is determined by the difference in energies characterizing the quadrupole vibrations of the heavy fragment and the rotation of the light fragment around the heavy one . indeed , in the zero approximation @xmath101 , @xmath102 and therefore @xmath103 .",
    "thus , for @xmath104 , @xmath105 can take negative values . in the case of a rotational bands ,",
    "the value @xmath106 must stay positive , achieving a zero value for the ideal unperturbed rotational bands of nucleus with stable octupole deformation .     for the quadrupole transitions between the subsequent levels in the ground state band and the first negative parity band._,height=9 ]    [ fig6 ]",
    "the important feature of the spectra is an appearance at low energy of the second excited negative parity band which contains the states of even and odd angular momenta .",
    "the second excited negative parity band has an interesting features .",
    "the state with angular momentum @xmath57=2 is lower than the state with @xmath57=1 . with increase of angular momentum",
    "the normal level sequence is restored .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is related to the significant contribution of the states @xmath94_{(i+1 , m)}$ ] and @xmath94_{(i+2 , m)}$ ] in the wave functions for even and odd angular momenta , respectively . in the limit",
    "if @xmath28 is equal to zero , these two states are degenerate .    in fig.6 ,",
    "the values of the ratio @xmath107 are presented as a function of the initial angular momentum .",
    "as it should be in the case of harmonic quadrupole oscillations of the heavy fragment the values of @xmath83 increase linearly with @xmath57 .",
    "they does not show any changes in the behavior for transitions between the members of the ground - state band and the first negative parity band since the underlying quadrupole constituents in both bands are the same .",
    "thus , the experimentally observed staggering of @xmath108 ratios can be attributed to the staggering of the @xmath84 values ( see fig .  7 ) .",
    "ratios as a function of the initial angular momentum for transitions in the yrast and first negative parity bands .",
    "experimental values ( filled circles ) are taken from @xcite._,height=9 ]    [ fig7 ]    such a staggering behavior of @xmath84 can be qualitatively explained with the use of equation ( [ be1 ] ) .",
    "we can see that the reduced transition probability b(e1 ) for the transition from state @xmath57 of the ground state band to the state ( @xmath57 - 1 ) of the first excited negative parity band consist of two contributions , since both dipole transitions are allowed ( see eqs.([twolevel1],[twolevel2 ] ) ) from the component @xmath90_{(im)}$ ] to @xmath109_{(i-1,m)}$ ] and from @xmath91_{(im)}$ ] to @xmath110_{(i-1,m)}$ ] . in the opposite case of transition from the states of the negative parity band to the states of the positive parity belonging to the ground state band",

    "the transition from @xmath111_{(i+1,m)}$ ] to @xmath91_{(i , m)}$ ] is forbidden because the dipole operator does not change a number of the quadrupole phonons .",
    "the @xmath2 ratios as a functions of an initial angular momentum are presented in fig.7 . calculated ratios for the odd initial angular momentum ( i.e. for transitions from the states of the negative parity ) lie systematically lower than the ratios for the even initial angular momentum ( transitions from the state of the ground state band ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental data with the exception of two data points at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "as it is mentioned in @xcite the large value of @xmath2 ratio at @xmath112 can be attributed to the loss of @xmath114 strength in the backbending .",
    "the rather small @xmath2 value for the @xmath113 attributed to the spread of @xmath115 strength due to the presence of two @xmath112 final states .",
    "we suggest a cluster interpretation of the multiple negative parity bands in @xmath0th assuming collective oscillations of nucleus in mass - asymmetry degree of freedom .",
    "this collective motion leads to the admixture of the very asymmetric cluster configurations to the intrinsic nucleus wave function and creates deformations with even- and odd - multipolarities . to take care of reflection asymmetric modes with nonzero values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the harmonic quadrupole oscillations of the heavy cluster is considered .",
    "the resulting energy spectrum consists of the ground state band and several negative parity bands which exhibit nearly equidistant behavior .",
    "the angular momentum dependence of the parity splitting is described .",
    "the possibility for the negative values of the parity splitting is related in the model to the interplay between the quadrupole vibrations of the heavy fragment and the rotational motion of the light fragment .",
    "we described the staggering behavior of the @xmath2-rations as a function of the angular momentum .",
    "the @xmath116 transitions from the state of the negative parity to the state of the positive parity is hindered , because these states contain different numbers of the quadrupole phonons .",
