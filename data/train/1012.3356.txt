    "fully developed turbulent flows are systems far from equilibrium giving rise to a transport of energy or enstrophy across scales .",
    "up to now , no generally accepted theoretical description of this transport process has emerged although the phenomenological theory based on the works of kolmogorov , onsager , heisenberg and their successors is quite successful in describing the gross features of turbulent fields ( we refer to the monographs @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional turbulent flows play a prominent role due to the existence of a direct as well as an inverse cascade , as has been emphasized in the seminal work of kraichnan @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of both cascades has been convincingly demonstrated by boffetta and musacchio @xcite .",
    "recently , a detailed analysis of the contour lines of zero vorticity has revealed interesting scaling behaviour pointing to the existence of nontrivial multi - point statistics of vorticity in the inverse cascade @xcite .",
    "the inverse cascade is a central issue in classical nonequilibrium physics @xcite .",
    "the present contribution is concerned with the two - point statistics of vorticity in the inverse cascade .",
    "starting from the hierarchy of evolution equations for multi - point probability distributions of vorticity , we shall perform a detailed examination of the partial differential equation defining the probability distribution of the vorticity increment relying on input from direct numerical simulation ( dns ) .",
    "the spatio - temporal dynamics of the turbulent field is governed by the two - dimensional vorticity equation @xmath0 the velocity field @xmath1 is determined from vorticity @xmath2 via biot - savart s law , @xmath3 viscosity is taken into account by the operator @xmath4 , where we allow for the presence of hyperviscosity as well as friction acting on the large scales . in order to achieve a constant energy flux in the inertial range",
    "we have used a hyperviscosity of the form @xmath5 and a large scale friction @xmath6 to extract energy transported to the large scales by the inverse cascade .",
    "energy is injected into the system by the forcing term @xmath7 . here",

    ", the evolution equations can be written for amplitudes and phases as @xmath12\\theta(k , k_0 ) \\nonumber \\\\     here , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the real and imaginary parts of the fourier transform of the convective term @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is a real function centered around @xmath8 and @xmath17 is a time relaxation constant .",
    "the function @xmath18 is different from zero only in the forcing interval . from this representation",
    "it becomes obvious that the forcing can be considered to be deterministic .    in most simulations",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) the forcing is located at a wavenumber @xmath8 that is close to the highest wavenumber resolved .",
    "in combination with hyperviscosity this allows for a wide inertial range and suppression of the direct enstrophy cascade .",
    "however , this leads to a poor numerical resolution of the forcing scale . to circumvent this flaw",
    "we inject the energy at an intermediate length scale and used a hyperviscosity that , for numerical reasons saturates at a maximal value .",
    "comparison with other numerical simulations showed that this procedure does not affect the results while yielding a better resolution at the forcing scale .",
    "the vorticity equation is numerically solved by means of a standard pseudospectral method with @xmath19-dealiasing in a periodic box with side length @xmath20 and a resolution of @xmath21 grid points .",
    "time stepping is performed by a memory saving runge - kutta scheme of third order @xcite .",
    "the hyperviscous term is treated by an integrating factor .",
    "data - analysis has been performed over more than 200 snapshots of the vorticity field taken from a simulation in a statistically stationary state .",
    "the snapshots are equally separated by about 1.4 large - eddy turnover times .",
    "figure ( [ fluxfig ] ) exhibits the energy spectrum in fourier - space in the inverse cascade , as obtained from our numerical solution .",
    "the spectral energy flux is constant and demonstrates the existence of the inverse cascade .",
    "the obtained kolmogorov constant @xmath22 , defined by @xmath23 is consistent with the results reported in the literature , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "the transport terms of the left hand side of the equation are responsible for the transport process in the cascade .",
    "they essentially depend on the three - point vorticity correlations @xmath35 since the velocity field is determined from biot - savart s law .",

    "the term related to the conditional forcing may contain second - order derivatives with respect to @xmath48 and then takes the form of a diffusion operator , @xmath49 .",
    "an alternative way is to write down the whole chain of evolution equations for higher n - point functions , a procedure which is well documented in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , up to now conclusive truncations of the hierarchy are lacking . additionally , we want to mention that a similar approach for the study of the velocity increment statistics of the inverse cascade has been undertaken by boffetta et al .",
