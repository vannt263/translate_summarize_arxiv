    "but we shall see that for many nice systems , such measures exist , have some uniqueness and describe important characteristics of the dynamics , e.g. , the repartition of the periodic points .",
    "a key aspect of measured entropy is the uniformity ( or lack thereof ) in the limits , when @xmath17 ranges over the invariant probability measures , @xmath127 .",
    "it corresponds to the existence of `` complexity at arbitrarily small scales '' . the simplest way . ] to measure this is the following quantity introduced by misiurewicz ( under the name _ topological conditional entropy _ ) @xcite :    the * local entropy * of a self - map @xmath2 of a metric space @xmath65 is : @xmath128    show that , if @xmath29 is compact and @xmath2 is continuous , then @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",

    ", one can define a class of subshifts over finite alphabets , the * subshifts of quasi - finite type * @xcite , which includes both the subshifts of finite type and the symbolic dynamics of piecewise monotone maps and satisfy most of the properties explained in this paper :      this class also contains new dynamics , e.g. , multidimensional @xmath521-transformations , i.e. , self - maps of @xmath142^d$ ] defined by @xmath741 where @xmath98 is an affine transformation such that @xmath742 for some @xmath637 and all @xmath743 .",
    "the entropy theory of arbitrary piecewise affine maps in higher dimension is mostly unknown @xcite beyond similar maps and piecewise affine surface homeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "one can further extend the approach explained here to * entropy - expanding * maps , which are multidimensional smooth maps with critical points such that the entropy of smooth submanifolds is smaller than their topological entropy .",
    "this class includes arbitrary @xmath139 interval maps with nonzero entropy @xcite and maps like : @xmath744 for small @xmath745 .",
    "they can be treated either geometrically @xcite or , under a `` general position assumption '' , by symbolic techniques with the introduction of * puzzles of quasi - finite type * @xcite which generalize to combinatorial puzzles ( as defined in complex dynamics ) the notions above .",
    "one obtains in this way , e.g. , that they possess finitely many maximum measures with bernoulli extensions ( up to a period ) .",
    "the * thermodynamical formalism * introduced in the uniformly hyperbolic setting by sinai and ruelle involves the introduction of a weight in the countings defining the entropy .",
    "this generalization of entropy is called `` pressure '' ( it is in fact the free energy per site of a one - dimensional crystal formally associated to the dynamical system ) @xcite .",
    "the measures maximizing the pressure are called the equilibrium measures .",
    "this generalization is very important for several reasons .",
    "for instance , if @xmath2 is a smooth uniformly expanding map of the circle , the equilibrium measure for the weight @xmath746 is the absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "most of the entropy theory can generalized to this setting either when in one - dimension ( @xcite and the references in the book @xcite ) or when there is enough uniformity in the expansion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) so that the regularity properties of the weight ( bounded variation or holder continuity ) also hold in the symbolic representation .",
