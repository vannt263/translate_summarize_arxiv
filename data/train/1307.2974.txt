    "the southern planetary nebula ( pn ) suwt  2 ( pn  g311.0 + 02.4 ) is a particularly exotic object .",
    "it appears as an elliptical ring - like nebula with much fainter bipolar lobes extending perpendicularly to the ring , and with what appears to be an obvious , bright central star .",
    "the inside of the ring is apparently empty , but brighter than the nebula s immediate surroundings .",
    "an overall view of this ring - shaped structure and its surrounding environment can be seen in the h@xmath2 image available from the supercosmos h@xmath2 sky survey ( shs ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite classified suwt  2 as of intermediate excitation class ( ec ; @xmath3@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the strength of the heii @xmath54686 and [ oii ] @xmath53728 doublet lines .",
    "the line ratio of [ n ii ] @xmath56584 and h@xmath2 illustrated by @xcite showed a nitrogen - rich nebula that most likely originated from post - main - sequence mass - loss of an intermediate - mass progenitor star .    over a decade ago , @xcite discovered that the apparent central star of suwt  2 ( nsv  19992 ) is a detached double - lined eclipsing binary consisting of two early a - type stars of nearly identical type .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that this is potentially a triple system consisting of the two a - type stars and a hot , unseen pn central star .",
    "however , to date , optical and uv studies have failed to find any signature of the nebula s true ionizing source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence the putative hot ( pre-)white dwarf would have to be in a wider orbit around the close eclipsing pair .",
    "@xcite recently derived a period of 4.91 d from time series photometry and spectroscopy of the eclipsing pair , and concluded that the centre - of - mass velocity of the central binary varies with time , based on different systemic velocities measured over the period from 1995 to 2001 .",
    "this suggests the presence of an unseen third orbiting body , which they concluded is a white dwarf of @xmath6 , and is the source of ionizing radiation for the pn shell .",
    "there is also a very bright b1ib star , sao  241302 ( hd 121228 ) , located 73 arcsec northeast of the nebula .",
    "@xcite speculated that this star is the ionizing source for suwt  2 .",
    "however , the relative strength of heii@xmath54686 in our spectra ( see later ) shows that the ionizing star must be very hot , @xmath7 @xmath8 100,000k , so the b1 star is definitively ruled out as the ionizing source .",
    "narrow - band h@xmath2+[nii ] and [ oiii]5007 images of suwt 2 obtained by @xcite show that the angular dimensions of the bright elliptical ring are about @xmath9arcsec@xmath10@xmath11arcsec at the 10% of maximum surface brightness isophote @xcite , and are used throughout this paper .",
    "@xcite used the mosaic2 camera on the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-m telescope to obtain a more detailed h@xmath2+[nii ] image , which hints that the ring is possibly the inner edge of a swept - up disc .",
    "the [ nii ] image also shows the bright ring structure and much fainter bipolar lobes extending perpendicular to the ring plane .",

    "the long - slit emission - line spectra also obtained with the emmi ( programme i d 074.d-0373 ) in 2005 revealed much more detail of the nebular morphology .",
    "the first spatio - kinematical model using the emmi long - slit data by @xcite suggested the existence of a bright torus with a systemic heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath12 kms@xmath13 encircling the waist of an extended bipolar nebular shell .    in this paper , we aim to uncover the properties of the hidden hot ionizing source in suwt  2 .",
    "we aim to do this by applying a self - consistent three - dimensional photoionization model using the mocassin 3d code by @xcite . in section  [ suwt2:sec : observations ] , we describe our optical integral field observations as well as the data reduction process and the corrections for interstellar extinction . in section",

    "[ suwt2:fig16 ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure and table that the ionization structures from the models vary through the nebula due to the complex density and radiation field distribution in the gas .",

    "similarly , we find that the higher ionization stages of each element are larger in the inner regions . from table",
    "[ suwt2:tab : ionfraction ] we see that hydrogen and helium are both fully ionized and neutrals are less than 8% by number in these best - fitting models .",

    "other ionic fractions do not show major discrepancies ; differences remain below 35% .",

    "we compared the post - agb age of these different models with the dynamical age of the ring found in ",
    "[ suwt2:sec : kinematic ] .",

    "the post - agb age of the hydrogen - burning model ( left - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ suwt2:fig15 ] ) is considerably shorter than the nebula s age , suggesting that the helium - burning model ( vltp ; right - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ suwt2:fig15 ] ) may be favoured to explain the age .",
    "the physical parameters of the two a - type stars also yield a further constraint .",
    "the stellar evolutionary tracks of the rotating models for solar metallicity calculated by @xcite imply that the a - type stars , both with masses close to @xmath46 and @xmath47k , have ages of @xmath48  myr .",
    "we see that they are in the evolutionary phase of the `` blue hook '' ; a very short - lived phase just before the hertzsprung gap .",
    "interestingly , the initial mass of @xmath49 found for the ionizing source has the same age .",
    "as previously suggested by @xcite , the pn progenitor with an initial mass slightly greater than @xmath46 can be coeval with the a - type stars , and it recently left the agb phase .",
    "but , they adopted the system age of about 520  myr according to the y@xmath50 evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature and stellar luminosity obtained for both models correspond to the progenitor mass of @xmath49 .",
    "however , the strong nitrogen enrichment seen in the nebula is inconsistent with this initial mass , so another mixing process rather than the hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) occurs at substantially lower initial masses than the stellar evolutionary theory suggests for agb - phase @xcite .",
    "the stellar models developed by @xcite indicate that hbb occurs in intermediate - mass agb stars with the initial mass of @xmath51 for the metallicity of @xmath52 ; and @xmath53 for @xmath54@xmath55 .",
    "however , they found that a low - metallicity agb star ( @xmath56 ) with the progenitor mass of @xmath49 can also experience hbb .",
    "our determination of the argon abundance in suwt 2 ( see table[suwt2:tab : modelparameters ] ) indicates that it does not belong to the low - metallicity stellar population ; thus , another non - canonical mixing process made the abundance pattern of this pn .",
    "the stellar evolution also depends on the chemical composition of the progenitor , namely the helium content ( @xmath57 ) and the metallicity ( @xmath58 ) , as well as the efficiency of convection ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more helium increases the h - burning efficiency , and more metallicity makes the stellar structure fainter and cooler .",
    "any change in the outer layer convection affects the effective temperature .",
    "there are other non - canonical physical processes such as rotation , magnetic field and mass - loss during roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) in a binary system , which significantly affect stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite calculated a grid of stellar evolutionary tracks with rotation , and found that n / h at the surface in rotating models is higher than non - rotating models in the stellar evolutionary tracks until the end of the central hydrogen- and helium - burning phases prior to the agb stage .",
    "the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) code developed by @xcite indicates that an increase in the rotation rate ( or angular momentum ) enhances the mass - loss rate .",
    "the rotationally induced and magnetically induced mixing processes certainly influence the evolution of intermediate - mass stars , which need further studies by mesa .",
    "the mass - loss in a binary or even triple system is much more complicated than a single rotating star , and many non - canonical physical parameters are involved ( see e.g. binstar code by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the cambridge stellar evolution ( stars ) code developed by @xcite to study numerically evolution of population i binaries , and produced a helium - rich outer layer .",
    "similarly , @xcite developed a helium white dwarf from a low mass progenitor in a close binary system .",
    "a helium enrichment in the our layer can considerably influence other elements through the helium - burning mixing process .",
    "in this paper we have analysed new optical integral - field spectroscopy of the pn suwt  2 to study detailed ionized gas properties , and to infer the properties of the unobserved hot ionizing source located in the centre of the nebula .",
    "the spatially resolved emission - line maps in the light of @xmath22n   ii@xmath23 $ ] @xmath56584 have described the kinematic structure of the ring .",
    "the previous kinematic model @xcite allowed us to estimate the nebula s age and large - scale kinematics in the galaxy .",
    "an empirical analysis of the emission line spectrum led to our initial determination of the ionization structure of the nebula .",
    "the plasma diagnostics revealed as expected that the inner region is hotter and more excited than the outer regions of the nebula , and is less dense .",
    "the ionic abundances of he , n , o , ne , s and ar were derived based on the empirical methods and adopted mean electron temperatures estimated from the observed @xmath22o  iii@xmath23 $ ] emission lines and electron densities from the observed @xmath22s  ii@xmath23 $ ] emission lines .",
    "we constructed photoionization models for the ring and interior of suwt  2 .",
    "this model consisted of a higher density torus ( the ring ) surrounding a low - density oblate spheroid ( the interior disc ) .",
    "we assumed a homogeneous abundance distribution consisting of eight abundant elements .",
    "the initial aim was to find a model that could reproduce the flux intensities , thermal balance structure and ionization structure as derived from by the observations .",
    "we incorporated nlte model atmospheres to model the ionizing flux of the central star . using a hydrogen - rich model atmosphere , we first fitted all the observed line fluxes , but the time - scale of the evolutionary track was not consistent with the nebula s age .",
    "subsequently , we decided to use hydrogen - deficient stellar atmospheres implying a vltp ( born - again scenario ) , and longer time - scales were likely to be in better agreement with the dynamical age of the nebula .",
    "although the results obtained by the two models of suwt  2 are in broad agreement with the observations , each model has slightly different chemical abundances and very different stellar parameters .",
    "we found a fairly good fit to a hydrogen - deficient central star with a mass of @xmath59 with an initial ( model ) mass of @xmath60 .",
    "the evolutionary track of @xcite implies that this central star has a post - agb age of about 25000 yr .",
    "interestingly , our kinematic analysis ( based on @xmath61 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies a nebular true age of about 2340026300 yr .",
    "table  [ suwt2:tab : modelparameters ] lists two best - fitting photoionization models obtained for suwt  2 .",
    "the hydrogen - rich model atmosphere ( model 1 ) has a normal evolutionary path and yields a progenitor mass of @xmath49 , a dynamical age of 7,500 yr and nebular @xmath62 ( by number ) .",

    "but this can not purely explain the fast stellar winds ( @xmath66kms@xmath67 ) of typical [ wce ] stars .",
    "it is possible that an external mechanism such as the tidal force of a companion and mass transfer to an accretion disc , or the strong stellar magnetic field of a companion can trigger ( late ) thermal pulses during post - agb evolution .",
    "the abundance pattern of suwt  2 is representative of a nitrogen - rich pn , which is normally considered to be the product of a relatively massive progenitor star @xcite .",
