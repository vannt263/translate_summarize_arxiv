    "it is important to measure them precisely .",
    "first constant , @xmath0 , is the electric charge of the electron , and is the unit of charge .",
    "charge of any object is known to be integer multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "millikan found the fact that the charge is not continuous but is quantized .",
    "atom is composed of a nucleus and electrons .",
    "nucleus has positively quantized charge .",
    "so by combining nucleus with suitable number of electrons , the system becomes neutral .",
    "the fact that the charge is quantized is important for the neutrality of matter .    concerning second constant , @xmath1 ,",
    "the fact that the light velocity is finite was known for a long time .",
    "it was discovered that the light velocity is universal in the last century .",
    "velocity of light which is emitted from moving matter is @xmath1 and the velocity of light that is measured by moving apparatus is also @xmath1 .",
    "this constant light velocity plays critical roles for special relativity .",
    "the third constant is plank constant , @xmath2 , which has the unit of action and plays the important role in microscopic world .",
    "when the light of a frequency @xmath3 interacts with microscopic systems , the light has an energy , @xmath4 .",
    "the light behaves like a particle in microscopic world .",
    "the electron which is a particle in classical mechanics becomes a wave of wave length @xmath5 .",
    "the plank constant determines the wave length , @xmath5 , of the electron of definite momentum , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 .",
    "particle is compatible with wave in quantum mechanics .",
    "physics which is connected with all these physical constants , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 may reveal fundamental dynamical principle of nature .",
    "one area of physics which is connected with all of them is quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "qed has a long history and has been well established by now .",
    "however qed is still an important topic of fundamental physics and may shed a new light for understanding our nature .",
    "a unique parameter of qed is the fine structure constant , @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of vacuum .",
    "another area of physics which is connected with the fine structure constant is the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) .",
    "the qhe is the phenomenon in semiconductors and is connected with fundamental science .",
    "qed is the quantum field theory of electron and photon which satisfies requirement of relativistic invariance , and the foundation of electromagnetic force is given from qed . in qed , electron field describes the electron and satisfies relativistic dirac equation .",
    "dirac equation is the relativistic extension of schrdinger equation and has a form of first order differential equation with hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "hence probability is preserved as is in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "peculiar feature of dirac equation is that the equation has negative energy solutions in addition to positive energy solutions .",
    "transition of electron in positive energy state to that in negative energy state by emitting a photon should have a finite probability if the corresponding negative energy state is empty .",
    "thus a particle state is unstable .",
    "if all the negative energy states are occupied in the vacuum and only one electron is allowed in one state , then the stability is ensured .",
    "from this idea , dirac is lead to introduce dirac sea .",
    "namely the vacuum is not empty but is full of electrons of negative energy states .",
    "all the negative energy states are filled with electrons in the vacuum .",
    "then the transition of electron of positive energy state into the electron of negative energy state and photon does not occur .",
    "the stability is ensured . because vacuum is full of negative energy electrons , a hole of dirac sea behaves like a particle of a positive charge .",
    "this particle is anti - particle of electron and is called positron .    photon is described by maxwell equations that is invariant under lorenz transformation and has no negative energy solution . but",
    "each mode of a definite wave vector is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator and in quantum theory each mode has finite energy due to zero point oscillation .",
    "thus the ground state , vacuum , of qed is not actually real empty state but has rich ingredients of negative energy electrons and zero point oscillation of photons .",
    "physical phenomena which are generated from these dynamical freedoms present characteristic features of nature in the microscopic world .",
    "one example of physical quantity which is generated from the vacuum fluctuation is seen in an isolated electron in vacuum .",
    "one electron has influences from these rich dynamical effects of vacuum .",
    "mass and electric charge are those physical quantities that are affected from these effects . if we knew both of bare values and the real values of these quantities , it would have been possible to observe the interaction effect .",
    "however in the real world the electron always interacts with photon and has an influence from the electrons in negative energy states .",
    "bare values of mass and charge are unobservable .",
    "therefore mass and charge are not appropriate to see the vacuum fluctuation effects .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is one of the physical quantities that is due to vacuum fluctuation effect .",
    "in fact , the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron gives an important information of the vacuum .",
    "the electron s anomalous magnetic moment is given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of electron . here the gyro - magnetic ratio , @xmath13 , is determined to 2 from dirac equation , if there is no correction from vacuum fluctuation .",
    "the real value of @xmath13 is deviated from 2 slightly and the @xmath14 is due to vacuum fluctuation .",
    "the @xmath14 is computed theoretically as a power series of the fine structure constant in qed and is measured experimentally with extraordinary precision .",
    "we compare the theoretical value of @xmath14 with the experimental value . from higher order perturbative calculation , kinoshita@xcite has obtained , @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the fine structure constant and the last term in the right - hand side of the above equation is the estimates from weak interaction .",
    "experiment by van dyck et al.@xcite uses an electron in penning trap for measuring electron s magnetic moment .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is given as , @xmath17 comparing the experimental value of @xmath14 with the theoretical value , we have the @xmath18 from @xmath14 , @xmath19 on the other hand , the fine structure constant is determined directly by quantum hall effect ( qhe ) , @xmath20    the value of fine structure constant obtained from the electron s magnetic moment is slightly different from the value that has been obtained from qhe .",
    "actually qhe gives the most accurate value of direct measurement of @xmath8 .",
    "now this difference is too small to conclude something definite , but in future it may become possible .",
    "so it is important to clarify if qhe gives the precise value of @xmath8 .",
    "qhe s are physical phenomena in two dimensional electrons with a strong magnetic field realized in semiconductors and are connected also with the above fundamental constants .",
    "integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) and fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) were found nearly twenty years ago and many other interesting phenomena have been found since then .",
    "study of new phase of qhe discovered recently and its implication to the precise determination of the fine structure constant are presented in the present paper .      in interface of special semiconductors such as gaas - algaas heterojunctions or silicon mosfet , electron s motion",
    "are restricted to a plane . when strong perpendicular magnetic field is applied , electron s two dimensional motion is frozen due to magnetic field . as was solved by landau first@xcite ,",
    "electron s energy becomes discrete and degeneracy of each energy level per area , density @xmath21 , is proportional to the magnetic field , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic field and @xmath24 is the electron s mass and @xmath25 is a non - negative integer . in semiconductors there exist disorders which make these electrons been bound .",
    "electrons are localized around disorders and do not carry electric current if their energies are away from one of the above discrete values .",
    "conversely electrons with the energy of the above discrete values are not localized but are extended . because the electrons in the extended states carry electric current , hall conductance changes its value with a fermi energy if the fermi energy is in the energy region of extended state .",
    "if the fermi energy is in the the localized state region , the hall conductance stays to constant value .",
    "the hall conductance at plateau takes very special quantized value .",
    "this is the iqhe@xcite . in high mobility samples , on the other hand , interactions make electron system form new condensed states@xcite . from these",
    "effects hall resistance and longitudinal resistance are varied as shown in fig .",
    "many structures are seen . when the longitudinal resistance vanishes the hall resistance is quantized .",
    "vanishing longitudinal resistance means that the ground state at plateau has energy gap .",
    "the ground states of the iqhe and the fqhe have the energy gap and are incompressible . in the former system cyclotron energy gap",
    "is the origin of gap and in the latter system interactions among electrons is the origin of energy gap .    at plateau hall conductance",
    "is given as @xmath26 around @xmath27 , or as @xmath28 around @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath6 and @xmath31 are coprime integers .",
    "here @xmath32 is the electron s density .",
    "the former is the iqhe and the latter is fqhe .",
    "the value is quantized exactly despite the fact that the system has disorders and interactions .",
    "there is a special reason why quantization is exact in these systems .",
    "the hall conductance is a topological invariant of the mapping defined by propagator of the electrons in landau levels .",
    "this is a reason why the hall conductance is quantized in the system of interactions and impurities and is given in the next section .",
    "in addition to these quantum hall states , compressible quantum hall states have been seen at around @xmath33 and @xmath34 and higher landau levels .",
    "the compressible states at @xmath33 and @xmath34 are isotropic and expressed by composite fermion theory@xcite .",
    "a new exotic phenomenon at higher landau levels , where longitudinal resistance @xmath35 does not vanish and the hall resistance @xmath36 is not quantized , was found recently@xcite as in fig .",
    "extremely anisotropic resistance , where @xmath35 is very different from @xmath37 was found .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by new many - body state which has no energy gap and behaves like anisotropic gas .",
    "although bare kinetic energy was frozen due to magnetic field , effective kinetic energy is generated by interactions in the hall gas phase .",
    "we concentrate to study on the anisotropic quantum hall gas phase and its implications to the metrology of qhe . in the anisotropic quantum hall gas , one - particle kinetic energy which violates orientational and translational symmetries",
    "is generated . to study them",
    "we apply a hartree - fock mean field theory using a special representation which is symmetric in two directions .",
    "this representation , the von neumann lattice representation , is convenient to study field theory of the quantum hall systems .",
    "spectrum of nambu - goldstone mode and response of the system under external density modulation are found .",
    "hall gas has several peculiar thermodynamic properties which are connected with spontaneous generation of the kinetic energy .",
    "as will be seen later in the present work , these properties guarantee a stability and precision of the iqhe in the realistic systems .",
    "it is shown that the precise determination of the fine structure constant is possible from qhe .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner .    in section 2 , the von neumann lattice representation of non - commutative coordinates and formulation of field theory of quantum hall systems , i.e.",
    ", systems of two dimensional electrons in the magnetic field , based on the von neumann lattice representation are presented .",
    "hamiltonian and current operators are expressed with the electrons in the von neumann lattice representation and ward - takahashi identity are derived . using these relations low energy theorem on the hall conductance",
    "is derived .",
    "the hall conductance is written as a special topological invariant of the mapping defined by the propagator of landau levels and agrees with integer multiple of @xmath38 if certain boundary condition is satisfied .",
    "values of the topological invariant in the system of disorders , interactions , and periodic potentials are found .    in section 3 ,",
    "a mean field theory of anisotropic hall gas ( stripe ) is presented .",
    "a one - particle kinetic energy is generated by interactions and a fermi surface of the hall gas in the von neumann lattice is identified .",
    "thermodynamic properties and transport properties are reviewed .",
    "several spatial symmetries such as translations and a rotation are broken in the present mean field .",
    "nambu - goldstone zero energy excitations connected with these symmetry breaking are implied by goldstone theorem .",
    "the excitations are found to have a peculiar low energy behavior based on the single mode approximation .",
    "easy direction , in which the resistance is extremely smaller than the other direction , becomes orthogonal to the external density modulation of long wave length .",
    "this behavior is opposite to that of ordinary charge density wave of zero - magnetic field .    in section 4 ,",
    "implications of unusual thermodynamic properties of the hall gas are summarized .",
    "due to interactions or disorders , strip of compressible states are formed .    in section 5 ,",
    "implications of stripe and a strip of the hall gas to iqhe in realistic systems are presented .",
    "it is pointed out that the precision and stability of the iqhe in the realistic systems are derived from unusual properties of the hall gas . as the external current increases , several transport regimes such as quantum hall regime ( qhr ) , dissipative qhr , collapse , and breakdown appear .",
    "summary is given in section 6 .",
    "under the perpendicular magnetic field , the electron s motion in the planar space becomes different from that of the zero magnetic field . the representation which preserves characteristic features of the system such as discrete energy with finite degeneracy that is proportional to the magnetic field , magnetic translational invariance , and non - commutative guiding center coordinates is convenient to develop field theories .",
    "the von neumann lattice representation@xcite is such representation that is symmetric in two directions and is invariant under lattice translations .",
    "universal identities are used to give a proof of the iqhe .",
    "one - body hamiltonian for the two - dimensional electrons in the perpendicular magnetic fields is given as , @xmath39 since the velocity is connected with the momentum , @xmath40 components of the velocity satisfy @xmath41=-{i \\hbar eb \\over m^2}.\\ ] ] the above hamiltonian has a form that is equivalent to the hamiltonian without magnetic field if it is written by velocity .",

    "3 . using the ward - takahashi identity , the vertex parts are replaced with the derivatives of the inverse of the propagator , eq .",
    "( [ wt ] ) .",

    "we give a proof of this fact by treating the interaction term perturbatively .",
    "the electron propagator is defined by @xmath130 and corrections are caused by interaction hamiltonian . to use diagrammatic analysis ,",
    "we assign a solid line for the electron and a dashed line for a longitudinal photon , which expresses coulomb interaction .",
    "the current correlation function , @xmath131 , is expressed with electron propagator and vertex parts defined by the current operators and others .",
    "it was shown in the previous subsection that the slope of lowest order amplitude was obtained by the above topological formula , if ward - takahashi identity is used .",

    "the first order correction to the current correlation function and its slope at the origin of the momentum are given in feynman diagrams of fig .",

    ", they are connected each other and the slope of the total amplitude is written by the topological winding number of the full propagator .",
    "similarly the slope of the current correlation function at the origin in higher orders is classified to diagrams of two different topologies.@xcite in first type of diagrams , three vertices are attached to three different electron lines , as is given in fig .",
    "6 . using the ward - takahashi identity , integrand of these amplitudes can be written as the third derivative with respect to all three components of internal electron momentum .",
    "these amplitudes are symmetric in the lorenz indecis @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 of the currents and do not contribute to the asymmetric part in @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . since the hall conductance is the asymmetric part , the hall conductance is not affected at all from this kind of amplitude .        in second type of diagrams ,",
    "three external vertices are attached to one electron line which include all higher order effects , as is given in fig .",
    "so this amplitude is written by the full propagator and full vertices .",
    "since the current conservation and the equal time commutation relation between the charge density and electron operators are satisfied , the ward - takahashi identity between the full vertex part and the full propagator is satisfied as well .",
    "hence the slope of the amplitude of the second class is written by the topological invariant eq .",
    "( [ topological ] ) of the full propagator .",
    "it is possible to extend this theorem to general systems which have other dynamical freedoms than the electrons such as phonon and others .",
    "namely the hall conductance is written by the same topological expression in quite general systems .",
    "for later convenience , we study the current correlation function with two different momenta in the currents , as is given in fig .",
    "let us define such current correlation function , @xmath124 , which is a function of two momenta @xmath135 and @xmath136 and satisfies the identities , @xmath137 since the two momenta are independent , it is possible to differentiate these equations with respect to @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",
    "then we have , @xmath140 thus if the amplitude is smooth around the origin in two momenta and the first derivatives are finite , the amplitude is proportional to two momenta , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 @xcite",
    ". thus these amplitudes do not contribute to the linear slope at the origin .",
    "if a momentum conserving amplitude is written as a limit of momentum non - conserving amplitude , this amplitude also does not contribute to the linear slope .    in situations where the ultraviolet divergences are involved in perturbative expansions ,",
    "the renormalized propagator and vertex are to be used .",
    "they are defined in such manner that satisfy the ward - takahashi identity , and thus the hall conductance is written by the topological expression of the renormalized propagator .",
    "thus the quantized hall conductance is not affected by interactions.@xcite      in systems of disorders , translational invariance is lost and momentum becomes not a good quantum number .",
    "it seems that the momentum conserving term does not exist in the system of disorders",
    ". however we will see that it is not the case and the momentum conserving term exists . to study disorder effects",
    ", we use the diagrammatic analysis .",
    "it is shown that the above topological expression is valid also .",
    "for the bulk quantity such as conductance which is defined by a ratio between total voltage and total current , momentum conserving term contributes .",
    "momentum becomes a good quantum number even in the systems of disorders , as far as the bulk physical quantities are concerned .",
    "if the momentum is not conserved , the current correlation function , @xmath143 , becomes a function of two momenta and satisfies the identities , eq .",
    "( [ momentum - nonconserving1 ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ momentum - nonconserving2 ] ) . as was seen in the previous part , if the amplitude is smooth around the origin in two momenta and the first derivatives are finite , the amplitude is proportional to two momenta , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the condition of the smoothness around the origin of the momenta is equivalent to the absence of infrared divergence and is satisfied in the energy gap region and in the localized state region since one - particle states have the energy gap or the one - particle wave functions have finite spatial extensions .",
    "disorder potentials is expressed in the hamiltonian : @xmath144 spectrum of @xmath145 becomes different from that of @xmath48 and depends on the potential @xmath146 . for random potentials ,",
    "energy eigenstates appear in the energy regions between the landau levels . from numerical study",
    "it is known that these states have discrete energy and localized wave functions .",
    "so they do not contribute to conductance .",
    "hence when the fermi energy is located in this region , we treat random potential @xmath147 perturbatively in the calculation of conductance . for the case of periodic potentials ,",
    "perturbative treatment is not good and nonperturbative treatments for the calculations of the energy spectrum and conductance are to be made .",
    "now we give a proof that the momentum non - conserving term does not contribute to the conductance .",
    "systems with the random potentials are studied in the following .",
    "expectation value of the current density is connected with the current correlation function as , @xmath148 the total current is obtained by integrating the current density in whole spatial region , @xmath149 let us substitute the fourier transformation of the current correlation function and the scalar potential for the coordinate space to the momentum space .",
    "then we have , @xmath150 and v is the potential difference expressed with @xmath151 .",
    "consequently the coefficient @xmath152 is proportional to the linear term in the momentum .",
    "because the momentum non - conserving term has higher power than linear , the non - conserving term does not contribute to the conductance .",
    "now @xmath147 induces a finite flow of momentum and external momenta carried by the two currents is not conserved generally .",
    "this amplitude depends on two independent momenta and behaves as bilinear in the momenta .",

    "gauge invariance and magnetic field are two important ingredients for the topological invariant expression of hall conductance of section ii",
    ". we may ask ourself `` does the same topological invariant appear in physical systems without magnetic field ? ''",
    "this problem has been studied and affirmative answer has been obtained . namely if time reversal is broken , the same topological invariants appear .",
    "one simple system is a free massive dirac field@xcite in planer space and the other is time reversal violating condensed matter system such as unusual superconductor@xcite and others@xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the spectrum asymmetry of dirac operator which causes chiral anomaly and fractional charge in even dimensional space - time is the origin .",
    "the mass term breaks time reversal invariance , and u(1 ) symmetry is preserved .",
    "hence the value of the topological invariant is quantized without any correction . on the other hand , in time reversal violating superconductor , u(1 ) symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "so topological invariant is not necessarily quantized and has a correction .",
    "other phases have been seen recently but are not discussed in the present work .",
    "they include a series of fqhs around half filling , pairing state at @xmath385 @xcite , reentrant charge density wave @xcite , and many others",
    ". the von neumann lattice representation would be useful for studying these states as well .",
