    "many of these knots or groups of knots are known hh objects or parts of outflows imaged in less extensive surveys .",
    "we therefore also list the names of associated hh objects and previous h@xmath0 outflow names in table [ jets ] .",
    "overall , the combined wfcam h@xmath0 imaging , spitzer imaging and photometry , and co outflow observations provide a clear and rather complete picture of dynamic activity in perseus - west .",
    "our wfcam observations demonstrate that even shallow h@xmath0 imaging is an effective tool for finding outflows from the youngest ysos .    of the 26 molecular outflows in our wfcam tiles , 24 of them ( 92% )",
    "are driven by sources identified as embedded ysos by @xcite ; only 9% of the 85 h@xmath0 features have no obvious co flow counterpart or jrgensen ysos .",
    "the two outflow sources not identified by jrgensen et al . as embedded yso , lkh@xmath4327 and l1448-irs1 , were probably missed because of saturation in the spitzer bands .",
    "neither source coincides with a scuba core @xcite , so these bright sources have probably already cleared their cores .",
    "of the 38 jrgensen ysos in our field , 24 ( 63% ) drive outflows . clearly , the criteria used by @xcite ( mips / irac colours [ 3.6]-[4.5]@xmath31 and [ 8.0]-[24]@xmath34.5 and/or associated scuba cores ) is not only very good at identifying ysos , but also at identifying ysos that drive molecular outflows .",
    "shock - excited outflow features can of course be detected at both optical and infrared wavelengths , by virtue of their forbidden emission lines ( [ oi ] , [ sii ] , [ oiii ] , etc . ) , hydrogen recombination lines ( h@xmath4 ) , or  in the near - ir and mid - ir  molecular hydrogen ro - vibrational lines .",
    "however , the longer - wavelength transitions will be more effective in regions of high extinction .",
    "also , these lines derive from very different gas components : the optical lines typically trace hot , dense , partially - ionised , high - velocity gas ( t@xmath1010,000k ; flow velocities approaching 100 - 200  km s@xmath11 ) while the h@xmath0 lines trace low - excitation , shocked molecular gas at much lower velocities ( t@xmath10500 - 2,000k ; v@xmath1010 - 50  km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "it is therefore perhaps not surprising that , of the 158 hh objects from @xcite in our field , only 72 ( 46% ) of them were detectable in h@xmath0 2.122@xmath1 m  emission .",
    "similarly , only 37 ( 44% ) of the 85 labelled h@xmath0 features are associated with an hh object .",
    "many of the hh objects are faint in the optical , so in a few cases the lack of a detection in near - ir h@xmath0 emission may be due to the modest sensitivity of the wfcam survey . however , many of the hh objects are located around the periphery of each star - forming cloud ( see for example the comparison of hh and h@xmath0 positions in fig .  [ h2ngc1333 ] ) , where the molecular gas density may be too low to facilitate h@xmath0 excitation .",
    "clearly , a colour - composite image comprised of optical ( [ sii ] or h@xmath4 ) , near - ir 2.12@xmath1 m  and mid - ir 4.5@xmath1 m  imaging would be ideal for illustrating the high - excitation atomic / ionised ( hh ) , hot molecular ( ro - vibrational h@xmath0 ) , and warm molecular ( pure - rotational h@xmath0 ) flow components simultaneously , as well as the colours of white / blue foreground stars through to the reddest protostars .",
    "such a comparison is obviously now possible with ground - based optical imaging , wfcam survey data , and spitzer observations , for a number of well - known star forming regions .",
    "= 16.5 cm    = 16.5 cm      of the 26 h@xmath0 outflows identified in column 2 in table  [ outflows ] , 20 ( 77% ) exceed an arcminute in mean length ; three are parsec - scale flows , with a mean lobe length exceeding 11.5  ( the outflows driven by ysos 2 , 5 , and 20c ) .",
    "longer flows might be expected from more evolved sources , and indeed yso  20c and yso  5 do have flat spectral indices .",
    "however , yso  2 has a steeply rising sed ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this high value of @xmath4 may in part be due to excess emission from lines in some of the spitzer bands ( discussed below ) .",
    "however , when we plot flow length against spitzer spectral index we find no correlation between these two parameters .",
    "this suggests that even the most deeply embedded h@xmath0 jet source are old enough to produce parsec - scale flows .",
    "it seems likely that jet length , when derived from h@xmath0 observations , is more sensitive to the environment ( specifically the presence of ambient molecular gas that may be shock - excited into emission ) than the `` age '' of the jet central engine .",
    "can we say anything about flow opening angles from our sample of jets in perseus - west ?",
    "high - resolution co maps of outflows seem to indicate that class 0 sources produce more collimated flows than their more evolved class i counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath0 emission features ( bow shocks ) often envelope the outer edges of co flow lobes , so one might expect to see a similar trend in h@xmath0 data .",
    "however , shock - excited h@xmath0 emission has a very short cooling time ( of the order of a few years ) , so h@xmath0 features are often short - lived and confined to a small percentage of the flow surface area .",
    "moreover , close to the central source h@xmath0 emission features tend to be associated with the central , on - axis jet rather than the swept - out cavity walls .",
    "defining flow opening angles from h@xmath0 images is therefore rather difficult .",
    "even so , in table  [ outflows ] we list the mean opening angle , @xmath13 , for well - defined flows with multiple , bright h@xmath0 emission features .",
    "@xmath13 is measured from cones in each flow lobe that are centred on the outflow source and which include all h@xmath0 line - emission features . a plot of @xmath13 against source spectral index @xmath4 ( not shown ) reveals no correlation between these two parameters .",
    "at best , we can only say that most of the flows in perseus - west appear to be well collimated , as is expected for jets from young , embedded ( high-@xmath4 ) sources .",
    "the opening angles listed have a mean of 12.5@xmath6  and a standard deviation of only 4.1@xmath6 .",
    "the associated sources have a relatively broad range in @xmath4 : -0.87 to 3.79 .",
    "many of the h@xmath0 jets in perseus appear to be curved or possibly even precessing .",
    "if both lobes curve in the same direction ( h@xmath0 features 24 in the b1 ridge and 76/77 in l1448 are good examples ) the flow curvature may be due to the motion of the source through the ambient medium .",
    "in such cases the source would need a proper motion that is a sizable fraction ( at least a few percent ) of the jet velocity .",
    "source tangential velocities of the order of 1 - 10 km s@xmath11  would be required .",
    "alternatively , the _ apparent _ curvature may simply be due to excitation of h@xmath0 along only one side of an oval cavity , perhaps because of enhanced ambient gas densities or an ambient density gradient across the width of the flow lobe .",
    "precession or jet `` meandering '' has been identified in a number of flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "precession may result from the misalignment of binary orbital and circum - binary disk axes @xcite , although the disk should be forced into alignment with the orbital plane in roughly one precession period , which should be about 20-times longer than the binary orbital period @xcite .",
    "given this time limitation , jet precession is expected from only the most embedded and therefore potentially very youngest sources .",
    "notably , ysos 11 , 14 and 38 , the three precessing jet candidates in perseus - west , all have high values of @xmath4 .",
    "the h@xmath0 flows from ysos 11 , 14 and 38 appear to have precessed through roughly half a turn .",
    "the dynamical age of each flow should thus be a fair estimate of the precession period , to within a factor of @xmath102 @xcite . for a canonical jet velocity of 100  km s@xmath11(consistent with jet proper motions , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from the flow lengths listed in table  [ outflows ] , flow ages of 7300  yrs , 1400  yrs and 2600  yrs are estimated .",
    "hence , a very crude range for the precession period of these remarkable flows is 2800 - 14,600  yrs .",
    "[ histograms ] demonstrates how the outflow sources differ from the bulk of the c2d - catalogue ysos in perseus .",
    "the outflow sources , plotted with black filled bars , are generally much redder and have a steeper near - ir / mid - ir sed than the general yso population .",
    "the flow sources identified in this paper have a mean spectral index ( @xmath4 ) of 1.39@xmath141.14 ; the c2d ysos , which are predominantly class ii t  tauri stars , have a mean @xmath4 of -0.32@xmath140.89 .",
    "( in the c2d catalogue , in regions with @xmath15 where sources are mostly background main sequence stars , the average value of @xmath4 is -2.8 : evans et al . 2005 . )    the outflow sources also occupy a relatively distinct region in colour - colour space ( fig .",
    "[ ccandcmag ] ) .",
    "they possess a high [ 4.5]-[24 ] irac / mips colour , as predicted for young sources with massive accretion disks @xcite .",
    "however , they also exhibit positive [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colours , unlike the bulk of the c2d ysos , where the near - zero [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colours are due to the intrinsic shape of the yso sed . in fig .",

    "sources detected in multiple spitzer and/or 2mass bands exhibit some scatter about this strip , since @xmath4 is derived from photometry points that are modified by various absorption features ( ice , silicate dust , etc . ) and emission lines ( h@xmath0 , [ feii ] , [ neii ] , etc . ) , as well as the intrinsic shape of the yso sed ( i.e. that of an embedded source with a disk and probably also a disk - hole ) .",

    "they stress that the bulk of the cloud material is contained in these extensive , moderate - density regions , rather than in the high - extinction cores not traced by the extinction map .",
    "kirk et al .",
    "measure masses of 441m@xmath21 , 973m@xmath21 , 174m@xmath21  and 240m@xmath21  for the b1 , ngc1333 , l1448 and l1455 supercores , respectively .",
    "thus , in perseus - west there is one molecular outflow for every 44 - 88m@xmath21  of ambient material .",
    "roughly 50 generations of accretion / outflow activity would be needed to convert all of this molecular material into solar - mass stars .    in some regions many of the jets appear to be roughly parallel , though this common angle is not obviously related to the large - scale cloud structure .",
    "l1448 is perhaps the best example , where the position angles of the four outflows identified in fig .",
    "[ h2l1448 ] are between 147@xmath6  and 155@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite fit 2-dimensional gaussians to their supercores and , from their fig .  5",
    ", we measure a supercore position angle of 120@xmath6  for l1448 . in l1448",
    ", the outflows thus appear to flow along the length of the supercore .",
    "however , the two parallel flows in the b1-ridge region ( fig .  [ h2b1r ] ; pas of 124@xmath6  and 130@xmath6 ) are almost perpendicular to the elongated b1-ridge supercore ( pa @xmath10 50@xmath6 ) .",
    "the flows in b1 , ngc1333 and l1455 are more randomly orientated , although at least four of the larger flows in ngc1333 are aligned roughly north - south , parallel with the associated supercore ( pa @xmath10 10@xmath6 ) .",
    "even so , we conclude that in general the outflows are randomly orientated and that the large - scale could structure , as traced by the extinction mapping of @xcite , has no obvious influence on flow orientations .",
    "molecular outflows from young stars inject turbulent energy and momentum into the surrounding medium . over time",
    "these flows probably provide turbulent support against cloud collapse and may even hinder the star formation process . in low - mass star forming regions usually only a dozen or so outflows are observed at any one time ( ngc1333 is a good example ) .",
    "here we investigate whether these outflows provide sufficient kinetic energy to account for the observed turbulence in the ambient medium .    as was noted by @xcite , one can estimate the turbulent momentum and energy in a star - forming region from the cloud mass , @xmath22 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath23 , measured from ( sub)millimetre molecular lines :    * for perseus - west we again use cloud masses from @xcite .",
    "the masses of their supercores ( estimated from 2mass extinction mapping for @xmath243 ) are listed in sect .  4.4 .",
    "although a sizable fraction of the overall cloud mass is likely to be in diffuse , lower-@xmath25 regions , outflows are unlikely to impart much of their momentum into these extended regions .",
    "also , masses derived from an extinction map are preferred over masses estimated from molecular line observations , since the latter may suffer from depletion and/or opacity effects . and like submillimetre dust continuum maps",
    ", optically thin molecular lines will only trace the denser core regions ( @xmath245 ) . *",
    "a turbulent velocity is difficult to generalise for each region .",
    "the widths of molecular lines will result from turbulent and thermal motions in the molecular gas , as well as macroscopic motions if many independent cores are viewed along the same line of sight .",
    "in nearby , low - mass star forming regions the latter should not be a major problem .",
    "however , due to opacity and depletion effects , different molecular lines will trace different components of the ambient gas .",
    "@xcite find that in perseus n@xmath0h@xmath26 ( 1 - 0 ) lines are broadened almost exclusively by thermal motions in dense cores ; c@xmath27o ( 2 - 1 ) is more sensitive to lower density material in the envelopes of dense cores ( the c@xmath27o transition has a critical density of 10@xmath28  @xmath18 and freezes out onto dust grains at densities above 10@xmath29  @xmath18 ) .",
    "c@xmath27o is therefore a better tracer of the non - thermal motions in the interstellar  and intercore",
    " environment pervaded by molecular outflows . across perseus c@xmath27o profile widths vary by only a few tenths of a km s@xmath11 . from kirk",
    "et al . ( 2007 ) we therefore adopt a mean value of 0.6 km s@xmath11  for @xmath23 for all regions considered .    in table  [ turb ] we list the turbulent momentum @xmath30 and turbulent energy @xmath31 in each of the clouds observed in perseus .",
    "the momentum and energy of an outflow from a young star is hard to measure from infrared observations .",
    "therefore , to estimate the combined momentum and energy , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , of the outflows from the embedded ysos in each supercore in perseus , we use the canonical values for the momentum flux for class 0 and class i low mass protostellar outflows measured by @xcite , and multiply these by the accretion lifetime of the embedded phase @xcite .",
    "the momentum and energy flux of an outflow is thought to decrease with time , in line with decreasing accretion rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore ignore the class ii / iii outflow phase .",
    "if the momentum flux for the class 0 and i phases is @xmath34  m@xmath21 km s@xmath11  yr@xmath11 and @xmath35  m@xmath21 km s@xmath11  yr@xmath11 respectively , then for durations of @xmath36 and @xmath17 years , over its lifetime an outflow from a low - mass protostar should inject @xmath101.0  m@xmath21 km s@xmath11  of momentum into its surroundings .",
    "the outflow kinetic energy scales with the velocity ; since most of the molecular material in outflows is probably entrained in the relatively slow - moving wings of bow shocks , then for a molecular flow velocity of @xmath1020 km s@xmath11(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the kinetic energy supplied by a typical flow would be @xmath37  j . in table",
    "[ turb ] we thus multiply these canonical values by the number of observed h@xmath0 flows in each region to get @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "although the combined energy of the outflows , @xmath33 , matches our estimates for the turbulent energy in each cloud , @xmath38 , the combined momentum , @xmath32 , falls short of @xmath39 by at least an order of magnitude in each region in table  [ turb ] .",
    "it has been argued that a large fraction of the jet momentum may be carried by a collimated , high - velocity jet @xcite .",
    "however , the transport of this momentum component to the surrounding cloud may be relatively inefficient , as the heavy jet punches its way through the ambient medium .",
    "the existence of parsec - scale jets and the high proper motions of even the most distant jet knots suggest that jets are relatively unhindered by their surroundings .",
    "our assumption , that only the massive though low - velocity molecular flow component contributes to the turbulent motions in the ambient medium , is therefore probably still valid .    instead",
    ", the turbulent momentum in the surrounding cloud may be built up via many generations of outflows .",
    "the lifetime of a giant molecular cloud is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude longer than the duration of the class 0/i phase , and class 0 , i and class ii ysos clearly co - exist in many star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , over the lifetime of a gmc , many generations of outflows may contribute to the observed turbulent momentum in the surrounding cloud .",
    "we examine near- and mid - ir images of a @xmath104 square degree region in perseus - west and compare these to published catalogues of hh objects and moderately - extensive co 3 - 2 maps .",
    "we find that in most cases molecular shock features are morphologically the same at 2.12@xmath1 m  and 4.5@xmath1 m , although the more embedded portions of some flows are revealed only in the longer - wavelength data .",
    "h@xmath0 features are closely associated with high - velocity co lobes , in support of bow shock entrainment scenarios .",
    "however , they often do not coincide with their optical hh counterparts , because of extinction effects or the discordant excitation requirements of each tracer .",
    "we use irac and mips photometry to identify and characterise the outflow sources . in comparison to the full sample of ysos in the c2d catalogue , the molecular outflow sources possess extreme values of near - to - mid - ir spectral index , @xmath4 , and highly reddened [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] and [ 4.5]-[24 ] colours ,",
    "as is befitting their extreme youth .",
    "we find no correlation between h@xmath0 flow length and @xmath4 , nor between flow opening angle ( as traced in h@xmath0 ) and @xmath4 .",
    "in general , the outflows are randomly orientated .",
    "however , we do find a correlation between the number of outflows and the number of protostellar cores in three of the four regions studies ; in terms of total cloud mass , there is one molecular outflow for every 44 - 88m@xmath21  of ambient material .",
    "the outflows may also be an important source of turbulent energy in the interstellar medium .",
