    "buckling and crumpling of thin solid sheets and strips @xcite are commonly seen in our daily life ( e.g. , for fruits @xcite , paper @xcite , and polyster film @xcite ) as well as on the molecular scale ( e.g. , for viruses @xcite and atomistic graphene sheets @xcite ) .",
    "the shapes produced by the buckling of elastic sheets have fascinated many physicists . in 1691 , j. bernoulli proposed the problem of a simple bent beam or rod `` elastica '' , which led to the development of the calculus of variation and the elliptic function @xcite .",

    "the theory of elastica was recently extended to twisted rods to describe the shape of supercoiled dnas @xcite and it has been employed to draw smooth surfaces in computer graphics @xcite .    the buckling has been intensively investigated for langmuir monolayers on air - water interface @xcite . the buckling develops to collapse or fold of the monolayers into water . for a fluid membrane",

    "thus , the bilayer membrane is a simpler system so it is suitable to study the buckling of fluid membranes in details .",
    "recently , the stress of torque tensors in fluid membranes were derived @xcite . when the membrane is curved , the mechanical surface tension is anisotropic and deviated from the thermodynamic surface tension ( energy to create a unit membrane area ) . for a tubular membrane ,",
    "the axial stress is finite while the azimuth stress is zero .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the shape and surface tension of buckled fluid membranes using an analytical theory and numerical simulation .",
    "since the shape of buckled membrane can be analytically derived , the anisotropy of the mechanical tensions can be investigated in details .",
    "buckling is one of the triggers for breaking membranes .",

    "these effects are due to an increase in the arc length @xmath92 for the fixed aspect ratio .",
    "thus , the surface tensions are dependent on the projected area as well as the aspect ratio .    when the aspect ratio @xmath90 is allowed to change freely for a fixed projected area @xmath29 , the membrane elongates in the @xmath13 direction ( @xmath93 ) in order to reduce the membrane bending energy ( @xmath94 with constant @xmath45 in eq .",
