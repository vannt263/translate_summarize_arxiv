    "this paper studies curves on quartic k3 surfaces , or more generally k3 surfaces which are complete intersection in weighted projective spaces . studying curves on k3 surfaces is a subject of constant research , both from the points of view of classical algebraic geometry and more recent study motivated by physics .",
    "a folklore conjecture concerning rational curves on k3 surfaces is the following ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 13 ) for more details about the historical development related to this conjecture ) .",
    "[ conj:1 ] every polarized k3 surface @xmath0 over an algebraically closed field contains infinitely many integral rational curves linearly equivalent to some multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "mori and mukai @xcite showed ( attributed to bogomorov and mumford ) that every complex polarized k3 surface @xmath0 contains at least 1 rational curve which belongs to the linear system @xmath2 .",
    "one subtle point about this problem is the difference between _ generic _ and _ general_. here generic means a property held by members in a non - empty zariski open subset of the moduli space of k3 surfaces . while general means a property held by members in the complement of the countable union of proper zariski closed subsets ( typically hypersurfaces ) . using this terminology",
    ", one can deduce from mori and mukai s argument that a general polarized complex k3 surface @xmath0 contains infinitely many irreducible rational curves linearly equivalent to some @xmath3 ( see ( * ? ? ? * corollary 1.2 , section 13 ) ) .    in the late 90 s ,",
    "chen @xcite proved the existence of infinitely many irreducible nodal rational curves on general k3 surfaces .",
    "more recently , bogomolov - hassett - tschinkel @xcite and li - liedtke @xcite proved stronger result for general k3 surfaces based on sophisticated arithmetic geometric argument as well as deep geometry of k3 surfaces .",
    "our method in this paper is essentially elementary , constructive , and does not much depend on the special properties of k3 surfaces .",
    "in fact , it can also be used to produce many kinds of holomorphic curves in variety of situations , see subsection [ subsec : otherk3 ] .",
    "there are some unconventional points in our arguments , which might confuse the readers at the first glance . among those points",
    "are :    * we make use of log smooth deformation theory ( @xcite ) , but the log structures we put on k3 surfaces will not be defined on the whole surface . since we are interested in the deformation of curves on k3 surfaces , it suffices to put log structures only on a suitable neighborhood of the curve , see remark [ rem : log ] . * to see the existence of a smoothing of a degenerate rational curve , we must prove the vanishing of the obstruction . to prove this vanishing of the obstruction for rational curves , we make use of the vanishing of them for higher genus curves , which is almost immediate .",
    "see section [ sec:3 ] and the beginning of section [ sec : rat ] .",
    "the basic idea in this paper to construct rational curves is the same as in @xcite , although the original motivation came from a different perspective ( tropical geometry ) .",
    "namely , we consider a degenerating family of k3 surfaces and construct degenerate rational curves on the central fiber of it",
    ". then prove that the degenerate curves can be deformed into a generic fiber of the family .",
    "the difference in the construction here compared to the previous approach is that the degeneration we consider has the fixed central fiber ( the union of 4 projective planes ) .",
    "this is contrary to the situation of @xcite where the central fiber is the union of two rational surfaces intersecting along a general elliptic curve , and one may have to change the central fiber when he wants to obtain curves of different degrees ( however , it is quite plausible that the argument in this paper can be also applied to this kind of degenerations ) .    in our situation , varying the defining polynomials of the quartic k3 surfaces we start from",
    "is reflected to the distribution of the singular locus of the total space of the degeneration on the central fiber . in other words , fixing the defining equation determines the direction along which the degenerating family approaches to the fixed degenerate fiber .",
    "then the main problem is to prove that for zariski open subset in the space of quartic homogeneous polynomials , infinitely many degenerate rational curves can be deformed into a generic fiber .",
    "this will be done by proving the vanishing of the obstruction in section [ sec : van ] . as noted above",
    ", we prove the vanishing by comparing obstructions of curves with different genus .",
    "this point is discussed in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec : obstclass ] . in section",
    "[ sec : rat ] , we construct infinitely many degenerate rational curves suitable to our argument .    as we noted above",
    ", our argument does not much depend on the geometry of k3 surfaces .",
    "for example , the same ideas in this paper can be applied to construct rational curves on calabi - yau quintic 3-folds and holomorphic disks on hypersurfaces on @xmath4 ( @xcite ) , and holomorphic curves on abelian surfaces ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , in a subsequent paper , we will use the idea of this paper to prove denseness result of rational curves on generic ( complete intersection ) k3 surfaces , which will lead to the solution of the full conjecture [ conj:1 ] ( see section [ sec : final ] ) . + * acknowledgment . *",

    "the ech 1-cocycles are clearly 0 , and since the coupling does not depend on the choice of lifts , the result must be identically 0 .",
    "however , it is important to consider local lifts which are not necessarily induced by the global lifts , in order to relate this argument to the case of deformations of degenerate rational curves .",
    "the important point is that although the domain curves are different , the generator @xmath143 of the obstruction class on @xmath185 and @xmath198 are identical after partial normalizaton of @xmath185 ( see remark [ rem : id ] ) .",
    "namely , there is a natural one to one correspondence between the components of @xmath198 and @xmath22 , and the restrictions of the generators of the dual obstruction @xmath199 and @xmath200 ( these are both isomorphic to @xmath27 by lemma [ lem : obstdim ] ) are precisely the same .    moreover , in the calculation of the obstruction in subsection [ subsec : kuranishi ] , clearly it is possible to choose the covering @xmath201 of @xmath185 so that for any node of the image @xmath202 , there is only one @xmath171 which contains the inverse image of that node .",
    "the covering @xmath201 gives rise to a covering @xmath203 of @xmath198 in an obvious way .",
    "that is , if @xmath204 is the partial normalization , then @xmath205 is the inverse image @xmath206 .",
    "note that some @xmath205 has 2 components .",
    "choosing the covering in this way , the ech 1-cocyle defined by the local lifts on each covering is supported on open subsets of @xmath185 or @xmath198 which do not contain a node . when there is a local lift of @xmath186 on a neighborhood of each node such that it can also be seen as a local lift of @xmath198 , the following holds .",
    "namely , if the cohomology class of the ech 1-cocyle defined by the local lifts on @xmath186 is 0 , then the cohomology class defined by the same ech 1-cocyle on @xmath198 is also 0 , since if the class is given as the coboundary of a ech 0-cochain @xmath207 on @xmath186 associated to the covering @xmath201 , it naturally determines a ech 0-cochain on @xmath198 associated to the covering @xmath203 , and its coboundary is the given ech 1-cocyle on @xmath198 .",
    "the condition that the cohomology class of the ech 1-cocyle defined by the local lifts on @xmath186 is 0 can be assured when such lifts can be extended to a family of lifts on @xmath185 , since the corresponding cohomology classes on @xmath185 , @xmath191 is 0 as we noted in remark [ rem:0 ] .",

    "@xmath210 is a suitable lift of a neighborhood of the inverse image of @xmath53 .",
    "note that since @xmath175 is pre - smoothable , the inverse image of @xmath53 is the set consisting of 2 regular points which belong to different components of @xmath198 .",
    "in particular , the neighbourhood @xmath210 has 2 connected components .",
    "recall that the set of local lifts is parameterized by the set of local sections of the normal sheaf @xmath211 of @xmath175 ( up to translation by sections of the tangent sheaf @xmath212 ) .",
    "according to proposition [ prop : normal ] , this sheaf , restricted to each component of @xmath210 , is the sheaf of usual normal sheaf of a line in @xmath135 , which is 0 at @xmath53 .",
    "using this freedom , we can change @xmath213 so that the image is contained in a hyperplane in @xmath214/t^2 $ ] .",
    "then it is easy to extend this hyperplane to a family of hyperplanes parametrized by @xmath192 , whose intersection with @xmath19 gives a family of local lifts of genus 3 curves .",
    "this gives the required lift of @xmath175 around @xmath53 . at the points which are not the intersection with @xmath79 , the analytic structure of @xmath198 and @xmath186 are the same , so local lifts of @xmath198",
    "can clearly be regarded as local lifts of @xmath186 .",
    "thus , these local lifts can be regarded both as local lifts of @xmath196 and also of @xmath175 .",
    "then by the above argument , the obstruction to lift @xmath175 vanishes .",
    "the calculation for the obstructions to higher order deformations is similar .",
    "if @xmath215 is a @xmath216-th order smoothing of @xmath175 , then since it is a curve of degree 4 in @xmath217 , there is a family of hyperplanes @xmath218 over @xmath219/t^{k+1}$ ] such that @xmath220 this can also be seen as a family @xmath221 of nodal genus 3 curves .",

    "this extends to a family of local lifts of genus 3 curves , and as before , the family of obstructions to lift these curves vanish by an obvious reason .",

    "this together with a standard result for algebraization @xcite , we have the following .",
    "there is a zariski open subset in the moduli space of quartic k3 surface whose members contain a rational curve of degree 4 .    then by a suitable compactness result @xcite",
    ", we have the following .",
    "any quartic k3 surface contains a rational curve .",
    "this is obviously much weaker than the result proved in @xcite , which proved that every k3 surface has at least 1 rational curve .",
    "the merit of the method here is that the same idea can be promoted to produce infinitely many rational curves on continuous families of quartic k3 surfaces ( in fact , more generally , of k3 surfaces which are complete intersection .",
    "see section [ subsec : otherk3 ] ) .",
    "although logically it is not necessary , in this section we perform some explicit calculation of the obstruction to lift maps such as @xmath190 and @xmath175 considered in the previous subsection , based on @xcite .",
    "we hope it would help the reader have some grasp of somewhat unconventional argument in the previous subsection .",
    "explicitly , we first prove the following .    [ prop : deg4_genus3 ] the obstruction to deform the map @xmath197 @xmath223 to a map over @xmath219/t^2 $ ] vanishes .    since the degenerate genus 3 curve @xmath190 clearly deforms , we know that the obstruction should vanish without calculation .",
    "so this proposition is obvious and requires no proof .",
    "however , we carry out the calculation from the point of view of actually calculating the obstruction cohomology class from local data since it helps to understand the cases of rational curves later ( see subsection [ subsec : obcal ] below ) .",
    "also , it may be interesting to see although the vanishing of the obstruction to lift @xmath190 is a trivial fact , from the point of view of local computation , it is a consequence of rather elaborate cancelations .    using the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath7 introduced at the beginning of section [ sec : k3deg ] , we write the hyperplane @xmath1 by @xmath224 where our curve @xmath225 of degree 4 is given by the intersection between @xmath11 and @xmath1 . here",

    "the line @xmath216 is parametrized as well using an affine parameter @xmath236 : @xmath237.\\ ] ]    since the coordinate @xmath80 is nonzero around the point @xmath53 , we inhomogenize the given quartic polynomial @xmath9 dividing by @xmath238 , and write the resulting polynomial in the form @xmath239    now we take a local lifts of these parametrizations over @xmath219/t^2 $ ] .",
    "a lift of @xmath240 has the following expression @xmath241    note that if we take a global lift of @xmath190 , it is a quartic curve in @xmath7 and so if it is on the family @xmath19 , it must be on some hyperplane .",
    "note also that it is a general principle that the obstruction cohomology class does not depend on the choice of local lifts using which the calculations are done .",
    "thus , when we consider local lifts to calculate obstruction , we need not to restrict ourselves to choose particular local lifts which are contained in some hyperplanes . in the present case",
    "however , for notational simplicity , we choose the simplest one , that is , we choose local lifts which are contained in the fixed hyperplane to which the degenerate curve belongs .",
    "substitute these expressions to the equation @xmath242 and calculate the condition for the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath243 .",

    "these monomials of @xmath9 are @xmath281 times their coefficients .",
    "similarly , for @xmath282 , monomials of @xmath9 which are degree 1 with respect to @xmath272 and do not have @xmath280 as a factor contribute .",

    "also , to @xmath284 , the monomials @xmath285 of @xmath9 contribute to @xmath286 , and the monomials @xmath287 of @xmath9 contribute to @xmath288 .",
    "then consider the monomial @xmath289 of @xmath9 ( modulo coefficient ) . to the obstruction @xmath266 from the point @xmath267",
    ", this term contributes @xmath290 times the coefficient of the term @xmath289 in @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of this monomial to @xmath291 is @xmath292 times the coefficient of the term @xmath289 of @xmath9 .",
    "so these cancel each other .",
    "similarly , consider the monomial @xmath293 . to the obstruction @xmath294",
    ", this term contributes @xmath295 times the coefficient of the term @xmath293 of @xmath9 , and to the obstruction @xmath296 , it contributes @xmath297 times the coefficient of the term @xmath293 of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , these again cancel each other .",
    "similarly , the contributions to the obstruction from various intersections of the lines @xmath298 eventually sum up to zero .",
    "thus the obstruction to lift the degenerate curve @xmath24 to a curve over @xmath219/t^2 $ ] vanishes , as expected .",

    "of course it vanishes since we obviously have lifts of @xmath197 up to any order . a basic but important point to notice",
    "is that given a @xmath216-th order lift @xmath300 of the map @xmath197 , the obstruction to lift it to the next order is determined by the data of @xmath300 , and does not depend on which local lifts to take for the explicit calculation . in particular , if we have a family @xmath190 of maps and its lift @xmath301 parametrized analytically by a parameter @xmath192 , then the obstruction classes to lift @xmath301 to the next order is a cohomology valued analytic function of @xmath192 .",
    "we make a notice about the properties of the local lifts of the maps @xmath189 and @xmath175 at the intersection with the singular locus of @xmath19 , from the point of view of the calculation above . as we mentioned in section",

    "are those where the constant @xmath311 is 0 .",
    "in fact , although all these first order lifts still have nodes at the point @xmath312 , one can easily check that the next order lift smoothes the node precisely when the constant @xmath311 is not 0 .",
    "compared to the local lifts @xmath313 of @xmath190 considered above , recall that the constant @xmath314 satisfied the relation @xmath315 where @xmath316 is the value of the ( unhomogenized ) defining equation @xmath9 of the @xmath100 surface at the image of the node .",
    "this constant @xmath316 equals 0 if and only if the corresponding point on @xmath11 is the singularity of the total space @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the above expression for @xmath317 gives an explicit family of local lifts of the degenerate curves @xmath190 including @xmath195 .",
    "choosing other coefficients appropriately , we obtain a family of local lifts whose restriction to the parameter @xmath195 can also be regarded as a lift of @xmath318 , which was used for the calculation of the obstruction to lift @xmath175 in the proof of proposition [ prop : lift ] .",
    "since these local lifts are analytic , clearly their pairings with the generator of the dual obstruction class ( see lemma [ lem : obstdim ] ) give an analytic function with respect to the parameter of the family , as noted in the proof of proposition [ prop : lift ] .",
    "[ rem : normalsh ] the above calculation shows that the `` normal sheaf '' of the curve @xmath196 should be isomorphic to those of @xmath190 , @xmath191 described in proposition [ prop : normal ] .",

    "if there is an appropriate formalism extending the log smooth deformation theory which is applicable to the curve @xmath196 , the vanishing of the obstruction to lift @xmath175 will follow directly from the same statement for the curve @xmath196 .",

    "the curve @xmath22 has a natural log structure as described in section [ sec : k3deg ] such that the composition of the map @xmath24 and the projection @xmath71 can be equipped with a structure of a log smooth morphism .",
    "the obstruction space of the map @xmath24 is given by @xmath349 see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.14 ) .",
    "[ lem : obst ] the space @xmath350 is 1 dimensional .    in the present case , since the image of @xmath24 is a complete intersection , the kernel @xmath351 of the complex @xmath352 is locally free of rank 1 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 27.5 ) ) . here",
    "@xmath353 is the ideal sheaf of the image of @xmath24 .",
    "the sheaf @xmath351 is described as follows .",
    "it suffices to describe it restricted to each irreducible component of @xmath22 .",
    "a component @xmath164 of @xmath22 mapped to @xmath75 by @xmath24 has several special points .",
    "namely ,    * nodes of @xmath22 mapped to the interior of @xmath14 .",
    "let us write them by @xmath354 * 3 nodes of @xmath22 mapped to the boundary of @xmath14 .",
    "let us write them by @xmath355 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath351 to @xmath164 is isomorphic to @xmath356 here @xmath357 is the usual conormal sheaf of a line in @xmath135 , which is isomorphic to @xmath358 .",
    "then we have isomorphisms @xmath359 where @xmath132 is the dualizing sheaf .",
    "the restriction of @xmath132 to the component @xmath164 is the sheaf of meromorphic differential forms which can have poles at @xmath354 and @xmath360 .",
    "thus , the sheaf @xmath361 on @xmath164 is in fact isomorphic to @xmath362 which we considered in the case of rational curves . in particular ,",
    "the space of sections is 1 dimensional , and generated by the meromorphic 1-form described in the proof of lemma [ lem : obstdim ] . from this",
    ", it follows that the cohomology group @xmath363 is 1 dimensional .",
    "in this section we finish the proof of the following theorem .    the moduli space of quartic k3 surfaces contains a zariski open subset whose members contain infinitely many irreducible rational curves .",
    "the proof of lemma [ lem : obst ] gives an explicit description of a generator @xmath143 of the dual of the obstruction cohomology class . on the other hand ,",
    "the obstruction cohomology class @xmath364 is given by the ech 1-cocycle obtained as the difference of local lifts of @xmath24 on a suitable covering of @xmath22 as in subsection [ subsec : kuranishi ] .",
    "since @xmath24 can be deformed by construction , this obstruction class clearly vanishes .    on the other hand ,",
    "the degenerate rational curve constructed in section [ sec : rat ] is presented by defining equations of the form @xmath365 where the hyperplane defined by @xmath366 intersects 3 singular points of the total space @xmath19 ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) , while the hyperplane defined by @xmath367 intersects 2 singular points ( see figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the line which is the intersection of these hyperplanes intersects the singular locus of @xmath11 ( not of @xmath19 ) at one point ( the circled nodes of figure [ fig:4 ] and figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "we introduce another parameter @xmath192 to the family of the degenerating higher genus curve : @xmath368 so that the part @xmath369 converges to @xmath370 when @xmath371 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath372 are taken general so that the zero locus of @xmath369 does not intersect the singular locus of @xmath19 when @xmath191 .",
    "then as we noted above , the obstruction of the degenerate curve to lift it to a higher genus curve vanishes ( when @xmath373 ) .",
    "now the coupling of the ech 1-cocycle obtained from the local lifts of the degenerate higher genus curves which represent the obstruction class with the generator @xmath143 of the dual obstruction class is an analytic function of @xmath192 defined on a punctured disk around the origin of the complex plane . by the above observation , this function is identically 0 . as in the proof of proposition",
    "[ prop : lift ] ( see also subsection [ subsec : obcal ] ) , these local lifts can be taken so that the lifts of the curve at @xmath195 can also be seen as lifts of the rational curve @xmath329 defined in subsection [ subsec : genrational ] , compatible with the log structure .",
    "then by the identification of the dual obstruction classes between the degenerate higher genus curve and the degenerate rational curve ( see the proofs of lemmas [ lem : obstdim2 ] and [ lem : obst ] ) , the obstruction to lift the degenerate rational curve , which is given by the limit @xmath371 of the above analytic function , also vanishes .",
    "thus , the degenerate rational curve has a first order lift .",
    "now since the degenerate rational curve is a complete intersection , its deformation is also a complete intersection .",
    "thus , the lifted rational curve can also be presented as the intersection of @xmath19 and a suitable hypersurface of degree @xmath159 . on the other hand",
    ", this hypersurface can be extended to a family parametrized by @xmath192 such that the intersection of its general member and @xmath19 is a smooth curve with higher genus .",
    "as before , the obstructions to lift these smooth curves vanish .",
    "then the obstruction to lift the rational curve must also vanish by the same argument as above .",
    "this proves the existence of the lift of the degenerate rational curve to any order",
    ". then a suitable algebraization theorem @xcite assures the existence of a rational curve on the smooth @xmath100 surface ( in fact , since rational curves are rigid , the formal deformation coincides with the actual one ) .    also , the validity of the construction does not depend on the choice of the degenerate rational curve ( in particular , its degree ) , and the construction is valid on the region where the coordinates on the total space introduced in subsection [ subsec : log ] are valid .",
    "this proves the theorem .",
    "the argument in the main text extends straightforwardly to other k3 surfaces which are complete intersections .",
    "for example , for the intersection of a generic quardric hypersurface and and a generic cubic hypersurface in @xmath374 definied by quardric and cubic homogeneous polynomials @xmath9 and @xmath343 is a k3 surface .",
    "then consider the deformations of these polynomials @xmath375 and @xmath376 , where @xmath377 are homogeneous coordinates of @xmath374 and @xmath8 is the parameter for degeneration .",
    "then the intersection @xmath378 gives a degenerating family of @xmath379 surfaces whose special fiber is a the union of 6 projective planes whose intersection polytope is given by the triangular dipyramid , see figure [ fig:11 ] .",
    "the singular set of the total space @xmath19 of the degeneration are 24 points , marked in the picture . choosing a hyperplane so that it intersects 4 of these singular points , we obtain a degenerate rational curve .",
    "this degenerate rational curve is in turn the limit of degenerate genus 4 curves , whose obstruction to lift obviously vanish . then the same argument in the main text shows that the obstruction to lift the degenerate rational curve also vanishes .",
    "similarly , for the intersection of 3 generic quardratic hypersurface in @xmath380 , the existence of infinitely many irreducible rational curve can be proved . in this case , the relevant intersection polytope of the degenerate @xmath100 surface is the octahedron and the total space has 24 singular points again .",
    "more generally , we can consider complete intersection @xmath100 surfaces in weighted projective spaces . in the cases of codimension 1 or 2",
    ", they are classified in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "although the author has not checked except a few cases , the same method in this paper should be able to be applied to these k3 surfaces .",
    "for example , consider a degeneration of a hypersurface of degree 5 in @xmath381 . if we write the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath381 by @xmath382 , such a degeneration @xmath19 is given by @xmath383 where @xmath9 is a general weighted homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 .",
    "the central fiber @xmath11 of @xmath19 is the union of 1 @xmath135 and 3 @xmath384 .",
    "the intersection complex of the central fiber is given as follows :              another point which is different from the degeneration of complete intersection k3 surfaces in projective spaces is that general member will be usually singular . in the case of degree 5 hypersurfaces in @xmath381",
    "above , a general member will have @xmath385 type singularity , which degenerates to the bullet in figures [ fig:12 ] and [ fig:12 - 1 ] .",
    "accordingly , the number of moduli parameters of these k3 hypersurfaces is lower than 19 , and to obtain the full moduli , we embed it to a higher dimensional projective space @xmath386 so that we can deform the singularity",
    ".    then if we take the degree of degenerate rational curves to be sufficiently large , it will be realized as the intersection of @xmath11 and a suitable hypersurface in @xmath386 .",
    "then the argument in the main text applies , so that we can produce infinitely many rational curves on zariski general k3 surfaces in this family .",
    "although the author has not proved that this method can be applied to all the complete intersections in weighted projective spaces , as far as he checked , it seems to work well in each case ( and it should work in the light of the denseness of rational curves on k3 surfaces mentioned later in subsection [ subsec : dense ] ) .",
    "however , in these cases many rational curves will degenerate to a curve which intersects the fixed points of the torus action ( that is , the vertices of the intersection complex of the central fiber of the degeneration ) , which require more work to handle with .",
    "also , since there are nice degenerations of general k3 surfaces @xcite , it would be quite plausible that the method of this paper can be applied to produce rational curves on more general types of k3 surfaces by looking closely at these degenerations .",
    "in fact , we need not restrict ourselves to k3 surfaces , and the same strategy will work in any situation where we can construct a nice degeneration .",
    "examples of these are given in @xcite for the case of rational curves in quintic calabi - yau 3 folds and families of holomorphic discs in hypersurfaces of any degree , in @xcite for the case of rational curves on fano complete intersections , and in @xcite for the case of holomorphic curves on abelian surfaces .      as we noted in remark",
    "[ rem : id ] , one of the good points of the construction in this paper is that the calculation of the obstruction hardly depends on the genus of curves . in particular , if we start from suitable degenerate curves , we can produce various kind of curves on zariski general quartic k3 surfaces .",
    "as an example , we consider the following construction .",
    "take the degenerate rational curve in figure [ fig:4 ] and a degenerate genus 2 curve as in the following figure [ fig:13 ] , which intersects the degenerate rational curve at the circled node .",
    "then cut the domain curve at the circled node and graft @xmath159 copies of the resulting curve , and finally graft the parts of the cut degenarate rational curve in the same way as in figures [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] .",
    "see figures [ fig:14 ] , [ fig:15 ] and [ fig:16 ] .",
    "the argument in this paper produced infinitely many irreducible rational curves on zariski general quartic k3 surfaces .",
    "but conjecture [ conj:1 ] states that not only zariski dense but _ all _ k3 surfaces would have infinitely many rational curves .",
    "a remarkable result in this direction is proved by chen and lewis @xcite , which states that for a general polarized k3 surface , the union of all the rational curves is dense with respect to the classical topology .    by expanding the argument in this paper",
    ", we will be able to show that there is a zariski dense open subset of the moduli space of quartic k3 surfaces whose members satisfy the conclusion of conjecture [ conj:2 ] .",
    "namely , by using the flexibility of the construction mentioned in remark [ rem : otherdeg ] , we can produce plenty of degenerate rational curves which are all smoothable .",
    "in fact , one can produce so many rational curves that their intersection with each of @xmath17 ( the intersection of the 2 neighboring components of @xmath11 ) will be dense .",
    "then it follows that the union of the degenerate curves as well as the smoothed curves on the smoothings of @xmath11 will be dense in the classical topology .",
    "once this is proved , then by a suitable compactness theorem @xcite , the union of rational curves is dense in _ all _ quartic k3 surfaces .",
    "then this implies conjecture [ conj:1 ] .",
