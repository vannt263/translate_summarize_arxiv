    "in statistical mechanics there are two main ensembles ( at zero chemical potential ) that can be used to compute equilibrium properties of large systems : the microcanonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "roughly , the first describes the physics of a system that is isolated and has total fixed energy .",
    "the second describes the physics of a system that is at thermal equilibrium with a large environment at fixed temperature .",
    "it turns out that in many cases , although not all , the two ensembles give the same predictions for very large systems .",
    "there is a long sequence of studies aiming at elucidating under what conditions the two ensembles can be used interchangeably ( see e.g. @xcite and the discussion below ) .    in textbooks the canonical ensemble",
    "is commonly introduced by considering the microcanonical ensemble of the system and a large environment and restricting to observables acting on the system only . under the assumption that the interactions of the system and environment are very weak",
    ", the canonical ensemble can be derived .",
    "however in many situations the assumption of weak coupling is not justified .",
    "for example , in many closed quantum systems small regions thermalize @xcite ; in this case the remaining of the system is acting as an environment .",
    "it is therefore an interesting problem to find more general conditions that guarantee the equivalence of the two ensembles .",
    "our main goal is to give one such condition : we show that short ranged interactions and a finite correlation length lead to the equivalence of ensembles for every sufficiently large finite volume .",
    "the condition of a finite correlation length ( and short ranged interactions ) is known to be required ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we let @xmath3 be a finite collection of _ vertices _ or _ lattice sites _ in @xmath1 dimensions with @xmath4 sites .",
    "we consider local hamiltonians , acting on the hilbert space @xmath5 , @xmath6 , given by @xmath7 where we assume that the @xmath8 are bounded , @xmath9 , and local in the sense that @xmath8 acts only on sites @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( for the manhattan metric @xmath12 in the lattice ) .    for such @xmath13-local hamiltonians , we let @xmath14 be the canonical state at temperature @xmath15 ( also known as gibbs state or thermal state ) and @xmath16 the partition function ( we set boltzmann s constant to unit ) . in the canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath15 ,",
    "averages are computed using @xmath17 .",

    "given two states @xmath31 , their trace - norm distance is @xmath32 and quantifies how distinguishable the two states are .",
    "we say a state @xmath28 has @xmath33-exponentially decaying correlations ( or a @xmath33-finite correlation length ) if there are @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that for every two regions @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39    given @xmath40 and @xmath41 , let @xmath42 and define the microcanonical state of mean energy @xmath43 and energy spread @xmath44 by @xmath45 in the microcanonical ensemble averages are computed using @xmath46 .    finally , for a gibbs state corresponding to a hamiltonian as in eq .   and with @xmath33-exponentially decaying correlations , we define ( see lemma  [ thmberryesseenthm ] ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant which only depends on the dimension of the lattice @xmath27 .",
    "we can now state the main result .",
    "it shows that for general quantum many - body systems at non - critical temperatures ( meaning that the canonical state has a finite correlation length ) , the canonical ensemble gives essentially the same predictions as the microcanonical ensemble , for every observable which acts on sufficiently small regions .",

    "the two ensembles differ in the ising model approaching the critical point , when the correlation length diverges , for regions of size @xmath64 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "an important step in the proof of the theorem will be to establish the following proposition , which we believe is of independent interest and which we prove in a stronger version ( proposition  [ strongerprop ] ) in section  [ proof : prop1 ] .",

    "( 2 ) following @xcite , it applies to a generic state in the microcanonical subspace , with overwhelming probability with respect to the haar measure .",

    ", the expectation is taken uniformly over @xmath49 .",
    "the second part of the corollary is a direct consequence of the first part , the quantum berry  esseen bound in lemma  [ thmberryesseenthm ] , and the result of @xcite , which shows that a generic state in a energy subspace has the same local reductions as the microcanonical state .",
    "the problem of equivalence of ensembles has been considered since the foundational work of boltzmann and gibbs .",
    "see @xcite for a historical perspective .",
    "an intuitive explanation for the equivalence at non - critical temperatures is the following : whenever there is a finite correlation length , the heat capacity , which determines the energy variance density , is of order @xmath86 , implying that the standard deviation of energy is of order @xmath87 .",
    "as energy is an extensive quantity ( i.e. of order @xmath86 ) , the distribution of energies in the gibbs state is highly concentrated around its mean value for a large number of spins , and so one might be tempted to believe that only the microcanonical subspace is relevant .",
    "however it turns out that this argument is too simplistic .",
    "indeed it is easy to see that for any @xmath41 , @xmath46 and @xmath17 ( with @xmath88 ) are nearly orthogonal for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "therefore any meaningful argument for the equivalence of ensembles must go beyond the distribution of energies and in some way restrict the kind of observables considered ( for example , considering observables acting in small regions ) .    the most fruitful direction explored so far has been to consider systems in the thermodynamical limit . in this regime",
    "one can prove the equivalence of ensembles on the level of thermodynamical functions @xcite ( showing that the thermodynamical limits of the entropy density in the microcanonical ensemble is the legendre transform of the limit of the free energy density ) .",
    "one can also show it on the level of states , as we do here , both for classical @xcite and , only very recently , for quantum systems @xcite .",
    "however the price of considering the thermodynamical limit  instead of the physically relevant regime of very large but finite sizes  is that no finite bounds can be obtained on the size of the regions on which the canonical and microcanonical states are close .    in this respect theorem [ equivalenceensembles ]",
    "goes beyond the earlier work in several aspects :    * it covers the general case of non translation - invariant models . *",
    "it is based on the assumption of a finite correlation length , which is simpler and more physical than the assumption of a unique phase region employed in @xcite . *",
    "it gives explicit finite size bounds ; for quite big regions of order @xmath89 the two ensembles already look the same . *",
    "it shows that the equivalence holds true even for microcanonical states with very small energy spread , of order @xmath90 and substantially smaller than the value @xmath87 that could have been expected .",
    "* it covers more general states than the microcanonical , showing that the important conditions are that the state has small free energy or that it is concentrated around a fixed energy and has sufficiently large entropy . *",
    "it shows that that any two microcanonical states @xmath46 and @xmath91 are locally equivalent whenever @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( assuming @xmath75 has a finite correlation length ) .",
    "it is an interesting open question to determine how small @xmath94 can be taken .",
    "we note that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) states that even for @xmath95 , i.e. for a single eigenstate , one should already have the same local expectations values as the corresponding microcanonical state @xcite .",
    "however , while believed to hold true for several systems , there are known counterexamples to eth , e.g. , systems with many - body localization .",
    "our proof can be seen as a finite - size version of previous results @xcite relating the ( micro)canonical ensembles in the thermodynamical limit , in particular the recent work of mller , adlam , masanes , and wiebe @xcite , who showed the equivalence on the level of states for quantum systems in the thermodynamical limit . there",
    "the authors obtained the result from two observations , which we now briefly explain .",
    "given a sequence of of translation - invariant hamiltonians @xmath96 acting on finite volumes @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 spins ) with a well - defined thermodynamical limit , we define the ( hermholtz ) free energy density as @xmath99 with @xmath100 the free energy density for a translation - invariant state @xmath101 in the infinite lattice limit . in @xcite one",

    "this uniqueness condition holds true if the finite volume gibbs states have a finite correlation length .",

    "indeed proposition [ weakerprop ] shows that every state of small enough free energy has its local reduced density matrices equal to the ones of the canonical state ( if the latter has a finite correlation length ) .",
    "this is a finite - size analogue of the uniqueness of the minimizer in eq .",
