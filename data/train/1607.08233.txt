    "two - phase flows configurations may involve different regimes in the sense that the topology of the interface separating both fluids may involve very different scales ( see @xcite for examples of different flow regimes ) .",
    "indeed , in flows called _ separate - phase _ flows , the variation of the material interface is described at the bulk fluid scale , while for bubbly flows or sprays , one phase is dispersed within a surrounding fluid and the interfaces are much smaller than the macroscopic dynamics of the flow .",
    "industrial applications may often involve flows where different regimes are at play successively or simultaneously .",
    "for example in combustion chambers , as described in @xcite , a liquid fuel is injected at high velocity and pressure . in the vicinity of the injection duct ,",
    "the fluids form a jet that can be considered as a separate - phase flow . however",
    ", further away from the injection point , the flow turns into a cloud of liquid drops . as there is a strong connection between the repartition of the droplets with respect to size and velocities and the quality of the combustion",
    "( see for instance a study in @xcite ) , being able to accurately model the creation of this cloud in the chamber is a key challenge for the industrial community .",
    "modeling such process is very difficult as it involves phenomena with very different characteristic scales , as is for instance widely described in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to bring out connections between a system that may be used for modeling a dispersed flow , in the context of bubbly flows , and systems pertaining to the category of separate - phase flows models .",
    "our approach leads to consider a five - equation barotropic two - phase model that is _ a priori _ neutral with respect to the topology of the interfaces and brings into play a hyperbolic convective part supplemented with stiff source terms .",
    "a key feature of this model is that it accounts for two - scale kinematic effects : bulk kinematics and also small - scale vibrations @xcite . on the one hand , by considering instantaneous equilibria within the model , we will show that it can be considered as a parent model for two sub - models that are used in the literature for the simulation of separate - phase flows  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our five - equation model is compatible with hypotheses that describe the topology of a simple monodisperse bubbly flow .",
    "more specifically it is possible to retrieve an evolution equation for the bubble dynamics that is analogous to the rayleigh - plesset equation  @xcite .",
    "that way , we obtain a hierarchy of two - phase models that includes models suitable to both separate and disperse phase flows . moreover , using this hierarchy , we propose two different estimates for two relaxation parameters related to mechanical equilibrium between materials in the separate - phase model . this result is notable as these estimates are often replaced by infinitely fast relaxation processes or heuristic values @xcite .",
    "few works have already addressed this matter and proposed similar estimate",
    ". however , the choice of this parameter must be careful as an ill - considered estimate can lead to significantly underestimate damping effects in the system , as it will be shown in the sequel .",
    "the different choices for these fluid parameters will be tested by studying the acoustic regime and comparison with reference data issued from both experiments and the bubbly flows model of @xcite .",
    "this study will also shed some light on similarities and differences between the models of the hierarchy by considering their acoustic behavior as a benchmark tool .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , we will apply classical modeling guidelines : the conservative part of the five - equation model will be derived thanks to the least action principle .",
    "the system will be equipped with dissipative structures by enabling an entropy budget .",
    "after completing the definition of the parent five - equation model , two sub - models will be derived .",
    "we shall then consider the case of a bubbly flow and identify the parent five - equation model with a monodisperse flow .",
    "in this context , we will see that it is possible to identify parameters of the models with micro - viscosity and micro - inertia .",
    "furthermore , estimate for these parameters will be proposed .",
    "we shall then study each model of the hierarchy in the acoustic regime , by exploiting their respective dispersion relation .",
    "finally , we will compare the acoustic behavior of the models with reference data .",
    "in the following section , we construct a complete model for the simulation of a two - phase flow within the framework of the following three ground hypotheses :    1 .",
    "there is no mass transfer between the two phases , 2 .",
    "there is no shift velocity between the two phases , 3 .",
    "energy is a mute variable , completely defined by the partial densities and the local velocity .    in order to give a physical justification to these hypotheses ,",
    "we illustrate them in the case of a bubbly flow .",
    "the limits of such hypotheses will be discussed in sections [ sec : application ] and [ par : measures ] .",
    "hypothesis ( h1 ) is quite self - explanatory : there is no phase change , what is initially gaseous stays gaseous and the same for the liquid part .",
    "hypothesis ( h2 ) implies that the difference between the bulk velocity of both phase is neglected .",
    "this boils down to assume that velocity of the bubbles relaxes towards the velocity of the underlying carrying liquid with a characteristic time that is very small compared to other characteristic times that drive the flow .",
    "consequently , we shall assume that a single velocity field @xmath0 can be used to describe the macroscopic kinematics of both phases . eventually , physical justification of hypothesis ( h3 ) is more delicate . in @xcite ,",
    "prosperetti studies thermal effects in bubble oscillations and proves that , in the small perturbation limit , the bubble oscillation mechanism is driven by three dimensionless numbers : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean free path in the gas , @xmath3 is the wavelength within the bubble , @xmath4 is the bubble radius at equilibrium and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the characteristic thicknesses of penetration of thermal conduction within the gas and the liquid .",
    "@xmath7 is shown to measure a ratio between acoustic and thermal phenomena characteristic penetration thicknesses and @xmath8 for a broad range of acoustic frequencies .",
    "next , @xmath9 compares the thermal penetration characteristic thickness with the bubble radius and this allows us to discriminate two main regimes .",
    "when @xmath10 , thermal equilibrium is always reached within an acoustic period and the bubble oscillation can be considered as isothermal .",
    "when @xmath11 , thermal conduction between liquid and gas is negligible and the transformation can be considered as adiabatic . in both cases ,",
    "internal energy is simply driven by the other state variables and the energy equation is redundant . hypothesis ( h3 ) thus extends this last statements to all the regimes in @xmath9 , meaning that , with @xmath9 , bubbles oscillation goes from an isothermal to an adiabatic regime under the constant fact that energy is always a mute variable .",
    "as a consequence , in the case of bubbly flows or not , both fluids are governed by a barotropic equation of state ( eos ) characterized by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the densities , the specific helmoltz free energies and the partial pressures of each fluid , @xmath16 .",
    "then , @xmath17 denote the sound velocities within each pure material @xmath18 .",
    "if we note @xmath19 the mass fraction of each fluid , we have @xmath20 and if we moreover postulate that fluids @xmath21 and @xmath22 are immiscible , we can also define the volume fractions @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 . for convenience , in the rest of this paper we set @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , what allows us to define the density @xmath28 of the medium by @xmath29 finally",
    ", we suppose given a function @xmath30 that is the helmoltz free energy of the medium . the choice of @xmath31 will be specified later .",
    "thanks to hypotheses ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) , the total mass and the mass fractions of each fluid are conserved under the same velocity field @xmath0 and these hypotheses can be written as : @xmath32 or equivalently by @xmath33 , @xmath16 .",
    "the first step in our modeling work aims at deriving a system of conservation laws , that is hyperbolic and equipped with a mathematical entropy evolution equation . following the lines of @xcite for barotropic fluids , of @xcite for a system of equations for two compressible fluids and two temperatures , or of @xcite for a homogeneous isothermal two - fluid model",
    ", we propose to use a variational approach and hamilton s principle of stationary action to derive the conservative structure of our two - fluid model . before going any further",
    ", we introduce a few notations : if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two column - vectors whose components are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , then @xmath39 is a row - vector , @xmath40 is a real number and @xmath41 is a square matrix of size @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 is a field of square matrices of size @xmath42 then @xmath45 is a column vector of size @xmath42 , where @xmath46 . finally , we note @xmath47 the material derivative .    now , we need to define the kinetic energy @xmath48 and the potential energy @xmath49 that are involved in the conservative transformations of our system .",
    "we postulate that the specific potential energy of our system is the free energy @xmath31 .",
    "also , following @xcite , a key element of our study consists in considering a two - scale kinetic energy composed by a bulk kinetic energy @xmath50 and a mesoscopic kinetic energy @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a function of the volume fraction @xmath53 only and whose physical interpretation and characterization is given latter on .",
    "this mesoscopic kinetic energy can be illustrated in the context of bubbly flows , as taking into account the vibrations of the bubbles : it models the bubbles as mesoscopic resonators by representing their pulsating inertia . obviously , this split of the kinetic energy term is not specific to the context of bubbly flows .",
    "it allows a finer representation of general two - phase flows and the consequences of such a hypothesis will be further discussed in sections [ sec : application ] and [ par : measures ] .",
    "now , the lagrangian @xmath54 of our system is fully defined , namely : @xmath55 let @xmath56 be the volume occupied by a portion of fluid during @xmath57 .",

    "a transformation of the medium is fully characterized by the fields @xmath67 .",
    "equivalently , we can say that a transformation of the medium is fully characterized by the eulerian fields @xmath68 and the lagrangian mapping @xmath62 under the hypothesis that @xmath69 is compliant with the mass conservation .",

    "we shall examine the dissipative structures of system   in the next section .",
    "while we are not interested in bulk dissipation phenomena , we aim at describing small scale dissipation associated with the mesoscopic kinetic energy @xmath102 , see equation .",
    "this way , the damping of local microscopic pulsations of the interface due to various dissipative phenomena can be taken into account .    in the specific case of bubbly flows ,",
    "we illustrate our words by the large study done in @xcite , where the different damping contributions to bubbles oscillations are identified to be viscous , thermal and acoustic .",
    "for very small bubbles ( radius below @xmath103 m ) , the dominant damping effect is the mechanical one , due to the viscous stress at the gas - liquid interface .",
    "thermal damping effects are dominant for bubbles of larger radii and at low frequency pulsations .",
    "this damping is due to the heat exchanges between the gas and the liquid phases and to the thermodynamical state of the interior of the bubble .",
    "another form of damping is related to the `` sound '' emitted by the interface ( or the bubbles ) when it vibrates .",
    "this phenomenon prevails for high frequencies perturbations .",
    "however , in this range of frequencies , we believe that our model is not relevant , as it does not take into account diffraction , for instance .    in a general two - phase flow context , we now propose to introduce irreversible damping effects in our two - phase system , by adding terms to that are compatible with a mathematical entropy evolution equation . first , we suppose that equations - are valid , but we discard and consider that @xmath104 is now a quantity to be defined .    in the barotropic case , it is classic ( see @xcite ) to consider the total free energy of the system as a mathematical entropy : @xmath105 we now seek for an entropy flux function @xmath106 and a proper evolution principle for @xmath104 , such that @xmath107 or equivalently @xmath108 relation   reads @xmath109 using - to express @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 altogether with , we obtain that @xmath115 + \\frac{\\rho^2 y w}{\\sqrt{{\\nu } } }   \\left (   \\frac{\\partial { f}{}}{\\partial\\alpha } + \\sqrt{{\\nu } } y d_t w \\right ) \\leq 0 .",

    "one can also note that the asymptotic behavior for spatial attenuation at low frequencies does not depend on the value of @xmath126 , but depends on the value of @xmath129 , see figure [ fig : influence - epsilon ] for the 4-equation model .",
    "the model hierarchy also shows through when one spans frequency values @xmath233 ( and can also be noticed on figures [ fig : influence - mu ] and [ fig : influence - epsilon ] ) .",

    "indeed , assumption ( h6 ) does not allow to account for pressure fluctuations within the bubble , neither for pressure fluctuations in the liquid that act as inertial terms with respect to the bubble motion .",
    "these phenomena are the ground for thermal and acoustic damping effects , that are respectively driven by @xmath216 and @xmath215 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "what we observed in section  [ section : data comparison 1 ] is coherent with the analysis of @xcite : for the flows settings we chose , both thermal and acoustic damping are the main damping effects involved in the bubble vibrations .",

    "nevertheless , we saw that , by increasing the value of @xmath245 , it is possible to enforce an equivalent damping @xmath306 that better fits the reference data in this range of frequencies , especially close to resonance .",
    "this enables an alternate mean for determining @xmath186 and @xmath126 in order to cope with the flaws of the model without revisiting the core assumptions of the model .",
    "one could tune @xmath307 in a heuristic way to better fit @xmath244 and @xmath245 with respect to reference data , and thus use the acoustic regime behavior of model   as an evaluation tool .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a hierarchy of 3 compressible two - phase flows models .",
    "we have proceeded by deriving a model for a compressible barotropic two - phase medium that accounts for both bulk and small - scale vibrational kinematic phenomena .",
    "a notable characteristic of this model is that it is agnostic with respect to the regime in the sense that no assumption is made _ a priori _ concerning the topology of the interfaces : the model may describe either separate - phase or disperse - phase flows .",
    "following classical modeling guidelines , we used the least action principle and the elaboration of an entropy budget , to obtain respectively the conservative and dissipative structures of our model .",
    "the resulting system is a five - equation model whose convective part is hyperbolic .",
    "this system features two parameters : @xmath186 that is related to internal dissipation effects and @xmath126 that pertains to small - scale kinematic effects .",
    "two reduced models can be obtained by considering the regimes @xmath130 , @xmath247 and @xmath130 , @xmath308 .",
    "these limit regimes led to models from the literature that have been used for describing compressible separate - phase flows  @xcite .",
    "then we equipped our five - equation model with additional flow structure hypotheses that enabled the description of monodisperse bubbly flows .",
    "this allowed us to recover two evolution equations for the bubble radius in the nonlinear and linear regime , which can be interpreted as a complete and a linearized rayleigh - plesset equation .",
    "these connections have brought two important elements : first it has suggested to relate @xmath186 to micro - viscosity effects and @xmath126 to micro - inertial ones .",
    "then , it has also allowed to propose two possible evaluations for @xmath309 : a first evaluation that is based on the nonlinear rayleigh - plesset equation and a second one that uses the linearized rayleigh - plesset equation .",
    "comparing both evaluations allowed to shed some light on the impact of the simplifying hypotheses used for modeling the behavior of the fluid within the bubbles .",
    "the second evaluation suggested a way to compensate for neglected effects that may even be predominant in some flow configurations .",
    "we finally considered flows in the acoustic regime : we compared the behavior of monochromatic acoustic waves for each models of the regime with reference data provided by both experimental data and the two - phase model of @xcite .",
    "first , this study allowed to further discriminate the domain of validity of each model of the hierarchy .",
    "moreover , this comparison highlighted differences between the models of the hierarchy like the ability of obtaining resonance regime .",
    "good matches with the reference data were obtained with the five - equation model and validated the evaluations of @xmath309 in this particular situation . in this way , this study brought to light that the acoustic regime can be used as a useful modeling tool for testing and tuning key elements in flow models .",
    "the present work may be extended by accounting for additional phenomena like thermal effects .",
    "the model hierarchy that was proposed here may also be exploited for investigating coupling strategies in the context of numerical simulations involving different regimes .",
    "we recall hereafter the two - phase bubbly system studied in @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall only consider one - dimensional problems .",
    "this model is compound of balance equations for mass , momentum and energy for each fluid .",
    "these equations are derived following the lines of @xcite for deriving flow - field equations using averaging methods .",
    "constitutive equations are also used for closure purposes , and finally , an additional interaction laws enables to relate the pressures of each component and close definitely the equations .",
    "the derivation of this interaction law is presented just below , and is based on the same approach that the one used for deriving rayleigh - plesset s equation @xcite .",
    "first , consider the motion of a single bubble with a spherical shape of radius @xmath168 : one makes the assumption that the bubble undergoes oscillations that are driven by a velocity potential @xmath310 of the form @xmath311 where @xmath207 is the distance to the center of the bubble ( see @xcite ) and @xmath18 is the wave number associated with the disturbance of the velocity field coming from the surrounding liquid .",
    "the evolution of @xmath168 is derived by supposing that , in comparison with the gas inside the bubble , the liquid is almost incompressible and that the pressure far from the bubble interface is @xmath312 , then one supposes the dynamics of the bubble to verify the bernoulli equation as follows @xmath313 where @xmath314 and @xmath315 are respectively the pressure of the liquid at the interface between fluids and the density of the liquid . moreover ,",
    "one supposes that the motion of the bubble is constrained by the laplace relation that gives the jump relation between the pressure of both fluids across the interface of the bubble @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the surface tension and @xmath318 is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid and @xmath319 is the pressure of the gas at the bubble boundary . supposing the amplitude of the bubble oscillations to be small , and are complemented by an additional relation that connects the gas interfacial pressure variations @xmath320 to the radius variations @xmath321 .",
    "this relation accounts for thermal effects occurring at the interface and also for the thermodynamics properties of the gas .",
    "it involves complex expressions that will not be detailed here , we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed view on this topic .",
    "the other part of drew s model is made of six bulk balance equations given below - .",
    "they characterize the evolution of the system parameters at the macroscopic scale and are derived by applying an _ ensemble averaging _  @xcite .",
    "let us note @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 respectively the averaged values of density , velocity , partial pressure and specific enthalpy of the fluid @xmath326 .",
    "each fluid is supposed to be a compressible material that is equipped with a pressure law of the form @xmath327 . in the case of a dispersed bubbly flow ,",
    "the volume fraction of gas is defined by setting @xmath328 , where @xmath157 is the bubble number density .",
    "the partial masses are given by @xmath329 , where @xmath330 , @xmath331 .",
    "neglecting wall - shear effects and gravity , for one - dimensional problems the system reads as follows    @xmath332    [ eq : dp - system ]    where @xmath333 and @xmath334 are interfacial heat fluxes , @xmath335 is the interfacial area density and m accounts for interactions like drag force , virtual mass or basset force ( see @xcite ) .",
    "relation   is obtained thanks to and and governs the evolution of @xmath168 , by means of @xmath53 in - it allows to account for small - scale two - phase interface dynamics in the bulk dynamics .    finally , the system   has to be complemented with an evolution equation for the number density @xmath157 .",
