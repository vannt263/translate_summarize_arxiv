    "at the present time more than @xmath8 exo - planets are known which have been mostly discovered by the indirect method of the variation of the radial velocity induced by planets orbiting around the central star .",
    "it can be shown that young planets can be detected with adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging techniques at @xmath21-@xmath6 meter telescopes if they are sufficiently distant from their parent star .",
    "since it is reasonable to assume a coevality between the parent star and the planet , we can retrieve from atmospherical models ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 , baraffe et al . 2003 ) that planets having a mass in the range @xmath22-@xmath6 m@xmath4 and orbiting around young late - type stars ( @xmath6-@xmath23 myr ) have a typical brightness contrast with respect to the parent star of the order of @xmath24-@xmath25 , corresponding to a magnitude difference of @xmath26 of @xmath3-@xmath14 mag .",
    "this means that a planet can be detected at a few tens of aus from parent stars having distances @xmath27 @xmath1 pc .",
    "first results on the search for young and massive planets are reported by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using 4 m class telescopes and macintosh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and keisler et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using 10 m class telescopes . recently",
    "( chauvin et al . 2004 ) , a companion of @xmath12 @xmath3@xmath28@xmath29m@xmath4 was detected at around @xmath1 au from the central star 2m1207 , a very late type star ( m8 ) in twa hydrae ( @xmath12 @xmath6 myr ) .",
    "this object is , at the present time , the most interesting giant planet candidate ever detected and further confirmation of the orbital motion is needed .    from the point of view of the scientific motivations related to this kind of search",
    "it is certainly an important challenge to image directly a planet around another star , since it can provide a direct evidence for the existence of such a planet . at the present time",
    "only a few exo - planets have been detected with the photometric technique called _",
    "transit _ ( hd209458b - charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 , ogle - tr-113 ( konacki et al . , 2004 , bouchy et al . 2004 ) , ogle - tr-56 ( torres et al . , 2004 ) , ogle - tr-132 ( bouchy et al . 2004 ) , ogle - tr-111 ( pont et al . ,",
    "2004 ) and trres-1 ( alonso et al . , 2004 ) ) . moreover , direct imaging is complementary to other detection methods like the radial velocity variation technique .",
    "the latter is sensitive to objects orbiting at close distances from the parent star ( the radial velocity induced by the presence of a companion is indeed proportional to the inverse of the square root of the orbital distance ) while the ao imaging presented here would be sensitive to planets orbiting at much larger distances .",
    "according to statistical results retrieved by radial velocity studies ( marcy et al .",
    "2003 ) , most of the known exo - planets orbit at distances smaller than @xmath19 au and the semi - major axes of exo - planets found so far are not larger than @xmath12@xmath30 au .",
    "since the radial velocity technique is heavily biased towards short separations , the derived major - axis distribution is certainly not representative .",
    "not much is known at the present about potential planets that could exist at distances larger than about @xmath30 au .",
    "we note that the formation of exo - planets is quite unlikely at distances of a few tens of au . at these large distances",
    "the density of the planetesimals is low and the gravity from the central star is weak .",
    "this makes the process of planet formation inefficient and slow ( thommes et al .",
    ", 1999 , 2002 ) . however , different models predict the transfer ( jump ) or migration of planets to distances larger than @xmath3-@xmath6 au from the central stars . among these models ,",
    "we recall the gravitational scattering model which claims that in multi - planetary systems , due to gravitational interactions between the planets , it can happen that the lowest mass objects are ejected on hyperbolic trajectories and some planets can move on stable orbits of a few tens of au from the parent star .",
    "such models were proposed by weidenschilling @xmath31 marzari ( 1996 ) and rasio @xmath31 ford ( 1996 ) and revised more recently by papaloizou & terquem ( 2001 ) and ford et al .",
    "an alternative mechanism that could induce an outward migration is the planet - disc interaction ( veras & armitage , 2004 ) .",
    "it was proven that stable orbits of a few tens of au can be attained by a few jupiter mass planet under the effect of torques induced by the disc ( i.e at early stages of the star formation ) if the system has photoevaporation wind .",
    "numerical simulations ( veras & armitage , 2004 ) showed that , under the assumption of a typical solar - mass photoevaporation wind of the order of @xmath19-@xmath3@xmath32@xmath33 m@xmath34yr@xmath35 , an outward migration of a planet with few jupiter masses can take place with a frequency of the order of @xmath36 @xmath2 ( with respect to a sample of a few hundreds of simulations ) .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to find out if young and massive planets are present up to a few tens of au from the central star .    for these reasons , we planned and performed an extended survey aiming to search for massive exo - planets orbiting around nearby and young stars using one of the best available instruments at the present time for high - contrast ao imaging observations : naco at the very large telescope ( vlt ) ( see section [ naco ] ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ targets ]",
    "the criteria used for the selection of the targets are presented . in section [ naco ]",
    "we describe the observational strategy and we provide technical information on the observations . in section [ proc ]",
    "we present our data processing , in section [ planets ] we discuss an analysis of planet - like features identified in deep images and in section [ sensit ] we give a detection limit estimate for the observed targets . in section [ disc ]",
    "we discuss our results and finally , in section [ conc ] the conclusions of our study are presented .",
    "the properties of planets that we are searching for are : * ( a ) * the contrast @xmath26 between the planet and the central star should be @xmath3-@xmath14 mag * ( b ) * and the planets should orbit at distances @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath19 au from the central star .    the planet intrinsic luminosity , retrieved by evolutionary models ( burrows et al . 1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) , depends on the age of the system and the mass of the planet .",
    "the magnitude of a planet depends also on the wavelength used for the observations . due to the fact that planets strongly fade with age we selected stars as young as possible . following the evolutionary models",
    ", we define our selection ranges as follows : age @xmath12 @xmath6-@xmath23 myr , mass of the planets @xmath12 @xmath22-@xmath6 m@xmath4 and wavelengths in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands .",
    "obviously the nearer the target is from the observer , the smaller is the distance from the central star that we can reach and probe .",
    "therefore , we gave priority to nearby objects .",
    "we note that most ( @xmath12 @xmath41 @xmath2 ) of our targets have distances @xmath42 @xmath43 pc and only @xmath22 objects are located between @xmath1 and @xmath44 pc . in order to optimize the contrast conditions , we gave priority to late - type stars ( spectral type k - m ) .",
    "only one target ( hd @xmath45 ) has a spectral type g5iv .",
    "table [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] summarizes the properties of the selected targets and the theoretical magnitude of planets that might orbit around them .",
    "the magnitude of the stars in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands are retrieved from the magnitude in v band and the spectral type ( simbad astronomical database[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives also the references from which the targets were selected .",
    "a relatively large fraction of targets belong to the tw hydrae local associations , @xmath11 pictoris moving groups and tucana / horologium association ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ; song et al .",
    "2003 , barrado y navascues et al . 1999 ,",
    "barrado y navascues 2001 ) .",
    "the age of tw hydrae is estimated to be @xmath12 @xmath6 myr ( stauffer et al .",
    "1995 ) , the age of @xmath11 pictoris is @xmath12 @xmath13 myr ( barrado y navascues et al .",
    "1999 ) and the tucana / horologium age is @xmath12 @xmath46-@xmath47 myr ( zuckerman & webb 2000 ) .",
    "several other targets , members of young stellar kinematic groups , were selected from montes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we want to emphasize that the ages given in table [ tab1 ] are often approximate values , particularly for those stars which are not members of associations or moving groups . for sufficiently young low - mass stars ( @xmath42 @xmath46-@xmath1 myr )",
    "their location in theoretical hertzsprung russel diagrams can be used for an age estimate . for older stars ( @xmath38 @xmath1 myr ) the isochrones are often indistinguishable from stars on the zams",
    "( see for example barrado y navascues 1998 ) and therefore other age calibrators have to be employed like the stellar magnetic activity , the lithium abundance , the stellar rotation rate and the x - ray flux .",
    "in addition to these photometric signatures , the galactic space velocity is often employed for an age estimate and for defining young moving groups .",
    "young stars are indeed characterized by low dispersion of the galactic space - velocity components ( u , v , w ) .",
    "a few criteria exist in the literature defining precise ranges for these components ( eggen 1996 , jeffries 1995 ) .",
    "these same criteria are employed by montes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we avoided the selection of binary systems with separations smaller than @xmath12 @xmath29@xmath48 because the probability that a planet can find a stable orbit around one of the binary component is rather small .",
    "the binary systems included in our survey are : twa @xmath3 ( @xmath29@xmath48 ) , twa @xmath21 ( @xmath49@xmath48 ) , twa @xmath50 ( @xmath30@xmath48 ) , gj @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and bd @xmath53 @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the observations were performed with the ao system naco , consisting of the infrared camera conica ( lenzen et al .",
    "1998 ) assisted by the adaptive optics facilities naos ( rousset et al .",
    "2000 ) placed at the focus of the unit `` yepun '' of the eso / vlt @xmath21 m telescope .",
    "we observed @xmath46 targets during three observing runs : 16 - 19 february 2003 , 20 - 23 july 2003 and 7 - 9 january 2004 .",
    "two targets ( gj  @xmath56 and gj  @xmath57 ) were observed in service mode .",
    "table [ tab3 ] summarizes the observational instrumental parameters .    due to the rather bright central star ,",
    "our observational strategy was the following .",
    "first , we observed each target in a narrow - band filter ( table [ tab3 ] ) for a few minutes in order to obtain a non - saturated point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we obtained a strehl ratio ( sr ) in the range @xmath58-@xmath59 over the all runs .",
    "second , we obtained deep and saturated ( @xmath12 @xmath60-@xmath46 min ) @xmath40 or @xmath39 broad - band observations of each target ( table [ tab3 ] ) in order to increase the detectability on the psf wings .",
    "we used naco at a pixel scale of @xmath61 mas yielding a fov of @xmath62 .",
    "the optical wavefront sensor was locked on the target star yielding a typical resolution of @xmath12@xmath1 mas in @xmath63 band .    for the deep observations , we selected the exposure time ( dit in table [ tab3 ] ) of a single frame to obtain a number of counts ( for the central star ) larger than @xmath12 @xmath64 times the saturation limit .",
    "the deep images are saturated over a central diameter having a size of @xmath65-@xmath66 . for each target , a data set of dithered frames was obtained in order to correct for sky emission and the pixel to pixel variations in sensitivity .    in a few cases ( e.g. targets characterized by a smaller brightness ) we used a broad - band filter with a neutral density filter ( nd short - see table [ tab3 ] ) instead of a narrow - band filter to obtain a non - saturated psf . for hd @xmath67 ,",
    "due to its high brightness , we used a different observational strategy based on the absorption properties of a planet atmosphere .",
    "this target was observed with the intermediate - band filters ( ib @xmath68 and ib @xmath69 ) centered out and in the methane ( ch@xmath70 ) absorption band ( @xmath12 @xmath69 @xmath71 m ) .",
    "we expect that planet features would appear in the continuum ( ib @xmath68 ) but not in the absorption band ( ib @xmath69 ) .    due to the higher strehl ratio ( sr )",
    "reachable in the @xmath63 band compared to the @xmath39 band , we gave priority to the former band in order to optimize the probability to detect a low - mass companion .",
    "we chose the @xmath39 band only for the oldest stars ( @xmath8-@xmath23 myr ) , i.e. for planets having a theoretical colour ( @xmath39-@xmath72 ) @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 mag .",
    "we note that , according to the cond models ( baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) and for planet masses of @xmath22-@xmath6 m@xmath4 , the @xmath39 band is comparable to the k band for an age minor than @xmath8 myr . for targets with an age of @xmath8-@xmath23 myr the gain of the h band with respect to the k band is significant .",
    "the procedure used to reduce our data set includes iraf and eclipse packages .",
    "each frame was cleaned by a bad - pixel mask and divided by the flat field .",
    "in addition , the sky background was eliminated in each frame .",
    "the final deep image ( shift and add of all the frames ) was obtained using a cross - correlation routine in eclipse .",
    "we underline that the shift and add had to be done using a cross - correlation method since our psfs are saturated in the central zone .",
    "alternative methods , based on the gaussian fit to the peak of a psf fail in such a case .    in order to save observational time",
    ", we did not observe any reference standard star but we filtered the final deep images from the low spatial frequencies using two different methods . in this way the large - scale features of the saturated psf were removed .",
    "in the first method , we convolved the deep image of the scientific target with a two - dimensional gaussian function having a width roughly equivalent to the fwhm of the psf of the star .",
    "then we subtracted the result from the original deep image . only features identified outside the central saturated region ( @xmath12 @xmath65-@xmath66 )",
    "are reliable in all cases .",
    "we note that , if the fwhm of the gaussian function is much smaller than the fwhm of the psf of the star , the filtering is not efficient .",
    "this means that large - scale features of the saturated psf are not sufficiently eliminated and the potential planet - like features close to the star are not visible .",
    "if , on the contrary , the fwhm of the gaussian function is too large , the filtering eliminates also the potential planet - like features close to the star i.e. the structures having small spatial scale .    in the second method , we selected , for each point of the deep image , an annulus . calculating the average of these frames we obtain the estimate of the background of the deep image inside an annulus around the centre of our target .",
    "we finally subtracted the background from the original image .",
    "the annulus is characterized by an inner radius of half of the psf @xmath76 and an outer radius @xmath12@xmath22 larger than the internal radius .",
    "the central part of the psf is excluded in the calculation of the background because it introduces an offset in the average estimation . reducing the size of the inner radius",
    ", we increase the filtering of the low spatial frequencies . increasing the outer radius the estimation of the background",
    "is affected by features belonging to regions far away from the central part of the psf .",
    "we define an outer radius equal to @xmath22 times the inner radius in order to estimate a background on a limited region around the central part of the psf .",
    "we note that the final detection limit only weakly depends on the values of the inner and outer radius . repeating the filtering with several combinations of inner and outer radii the final detection limit shows differences within @xmath58 mag .",
    "the filtering was applied in a region of @xmath12 @xmath30@xmath48@xmath32@xmath30@xmath48 centred on each target .",
    "although the two methods have differences , they are based on the same principle aiming to eliminate the large - scale features of the saturated psfs . in section [ sensit ]",
    "the similarities / differences of the two methods are discussed with respect to the results that we obtained .",
    "after data reduction and filtering of all the observations as described in sec.[proc ] , a visual inspection of all the deep images was performed and a few point - like structures were identified in some of the images : v@xmath77 nor ( @xmath63 band ) , sao @xmath78 ( @xmath39 band ) , gj @xmath57 ( @xmath39 band ) , bd @xmath79 @xmath80 ( @xmath39 band ) , bd @xmath81 @xmath82 ( @xmath39 band ) , gj @xmath83 ( @xmath39 band ) and hd @xmath84 ( @xmath39 band ) .",
    "all the other targets did not reveal any point - like sources around them .",
    "we discuss here the nature of these objects trying to distinguish between artifacts ( ghost images ) and faint point sources at low galactic latitude .",
    "we have verified that all the targets observed in h band show three point - like features at the same position at about @xmath19@xmath48 from the star .",
    "fig.[bd_filter ] shows deep images of two of these targets : bd @xmath79 @xmath80 and bd @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "three point - like features are visible ( indicated by arrows and letters a , b and c ) at the same relative angular separation from the star .",
    "these features are probably ghost images produced by some imperfection of the broad - band filter or static aberration residuals that depend on the wavelength .",
    "this could justify the fact that they are visible only in @xmath39 band .    in only two deep images ( v@xmath77 nor and sao @xmath78 - fig.[sao_cand ] ) we observed clear point - like sources different from those created by the @xmath39 filter that we have just described .",
    "fig.[sao_cand]a shows the deep image of sao @xmath78 ( galactic latitude = @xmath85 ) .",
    "an object at around @xmath36-@xmath46 au from the star is visible .",
    "the estimated magnitude of this object is @xmath12@xmath86 mag in @xmath39 band . due to the low galactic latitude of sao @xmath78 , the probability that this feature is a background star is not negligible .",
    "fig.[sao_cand]b shows the deep image of v343 nor ( galactic latitude = @xmath87 ) .",
    "several sources were detected around this star .",
    "the estimated magnitude of all the sources is in the range @xmath14-@xmath60 mag .",
    "we note that a @xmath3m@xmath4 planet orbiting around this @xmath13 myr old star would have @xmath12 @xmath88 mag in @xmath72 band . besides this",
    ", we observe that the galactic latitude of v@xmath77 nor is relatively low ( @xmath89 ) and several among these point - like sources appear a few arcsec away from the central star .",
    "thus the probability that these sources are background stars is quite high .",
    "we can not totally exclude that the faint sources around sao @xmath78 and v@xmath77 nor are gravitationally bound massive planets .",
    "for this reason , a second epoch observation is necessary in order to clarify the nature of the detected point - like sources .",
    "knowing that the proper motions ( hipparcos catalog , perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) of sao @xmath78 are ( @xmath90@xmath91 -202 mas / yr and @xmath92@xmath91 -270 mas / yr ) and those of v@xmath77 nor are ( @xmath90@xmath91 -@xmath93 @xmath28 @xmath94",
    "mas / yr and @xmath92@xmath91 -@xmath95 @xmath28 @xmath96 mas / yr ) we deduce that after one year a re - observation could throw light on the nature of these objects .",
    "a forthcoming run is planned to definitely verify if these objects are indeed background stars .",
    "we remind the reader that an estimation of the probability that a point source having a faint magnitude comparable to ours in a field of view of @xmath29@xmath48 is a background star was done for a galactic latitude of @xmath12 + @xmath97 ( brandner et al .",
    "a probability of @xmath41@xmath2 was estimated in that case .",
    "our point sources are placed at a lower galactic latitudes ( @xmath87 and @xmath85 ) , and the point - sources are placed at around @xmath29@xmath48 from the central star ( in the sao @xmath78 case , fig.[sao_cand ] ) and at distances larger than @xmath29@xmath48 ( in the v@xmath77 nor case , fig.[sao_cand ] ) .",
    "we conclude , that the probability that such sources are background stars is larger than @xmath41@xmath2 .",
    "we conclude , thus , that no very promising massive - planet candidate was identified in our survey .",
    "to estimate quantitatively the detection limit of our deep images as a function of the angular separation from the central star , we used the following procedure . along a radial direction we calculated the standard deviation of the intensity over a box of @xmath98@xmath32@xmath98 pixels ( with typical values of @xmath98 of @xmath15-@xmath30 pixels which corresponds to the fwhm of the non - saturated psfs ) and one pixel step .",
    "we then averaged over all radial directions ( @xmath99@xmath100 ) and finally we calculated the contrast @xmath26 at @xmath3@xmath101 with respect to the peak of the non - saturated psf of the star . since the central star is saturated in the broad - band images we had to use the fluxes measured in the non - saturated narrow - band filters ( see table [ tab3 ] ) to calculate what peak flux our saturated broad - band images would have if they were not saturated .",
    "the non - saturated psf had to be multiplied by a constant factor ( @xmath102 ) to take into account the different transmission and width of the filters .",
    "if @xmath103 is the filter used to obtain the saturated psf and @xmath104 the one used to obtain a non - saturated psf , @xmath102 is given by :    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the filter transmission coefficient , @xmath76 is the full width half maximum of the filters and dit is the integration time of each single frame ( table [ tab3 ] ) .    in order to illustrate that our detection limit is reasonable , we scaled the non - saturated psf of one of our targets ( v343 nor ) to a flux value corresponding to a @xmath3m@xmath4 planet ( representative of the typical planets we are interested in ) and we placed this artificial planet in the deep image at different angular separations from the star .",
    "fig.[mascia ]  ( a)-(b ) shows the filtered deep images of the same target processed with the two filtering methods described above ( section [ proc ] ) .",
    "this `` artificial planet '' is placed at @xmath107 and @xmath108 from the central star .",
    "fig.[mascia ] ( a)-(b ) shows that a separation of @xmath108 is roughly the minimum angular separation at which a @xmath3m@xmath4 planet can be detected .",
    "figures [ det_lim1]-[det_lim4 ] show the detection limits as a function of angular separation for @xmath0 objects of our survey for which deep images have been obtained .",
    "we note that , in one case ( gj @xmath109 ) , a technical problem did not allow to observe the non - saturated psf and this prevented us to calculate the detection limit . in the case of the binary gj @xmath51 , we could calculate only the detection limit for gj @xmath51 a. the separation of @xmath12 @xmath52 between the two components was slightly too large to include both stars in the same frame in all the dithered positions .    for all targets , the detection limit is reliable starting for angular separations @xmath38 @xmath65 . for angular separations @xmath42",
    "@xmath65 the psf of the deep images is usually saturated .",
    "fig.[det_lim4 ] shows the detection limit of the two targets ( hd @xmath67 and bd -17@xmath100 @xmath54 ) that we observed through the more narrow `` methane band filters '' ( see section [ naco ] ) .",
    "since the optical quality of these intermediate - band filters is worse compared to the broad- and narrow - band filters , the final deep images appear dominated by structures characterized by high spatial frequencies .",
    "for this reason , the filtering is less efficient for these two deep images ( the dashed , dotted and full thin lines are quite similar - fig.[det_lim4 ] ) .    from fig.[det_lim1 ]",
    ", [ det_lim2 ] , [ det_lim3 ] we can see that :    * the detection limit of the filtered deep images is very similar for the two different filtering methods .",
    "this indicates that the achieved gain from the applied filtering is practically method independent . * the filtering of large spatial structures ( low spatial frequencies )",
    "has a variable efficiency .",
    "the angular separation range over which the filtering shows its maximum efficiency is @xmath110-@xmath111 from the central star . in this region the gain in contrast @xmath26 with respect to the non - filtered image ranges from @xmath112 to @xmath29 mag .",
    "* the detection limit is not the same for all the stars .",
    "this is not surprising because it depends on several parameters : the age , the magnitude of the central star , the wavelength used for the observations , the distance of the star from the observer and also on the exposure time . in one case ( the brown dwarf twa @xmath3b ) , the detection limit is rather low because we did not saturate the psf since the central star is relatively faint .    to calculate the typical performances of naco at subarcsecond distances , we averaged the contrast @xmath26 obtained at @xmath110 and @xmath107 for all the observed targets having a total integration time within the range @xmath60-@xmath46 minutes .",
    "we find , in the @xmath63 band , a @xmath26 @xmath91 @xmath50 mag at @xmath110 and a @xmath26 @xmath91 @xmath113 mag at @xmath107 .",
    "we find , in @xmath39 band , a @xmath26 @xmath91 @xmath114 mag at @xmath110 and a @xmath26 @xmath91 @xmath115 mag at @xmath107 .",
    "we recall that @xmath110 corresponds , for our sample , to projected separations of @xmath29-@xmath116 au , @xmath107 to projected separations of @xmath15-@xmath41 au .",

    "this illustrates nicely that naco is a well performing instrument for high - contrast imaging observations .",
    "the detection limit estimates also permit us to calculate an upper limit of the projected separation between a star and a potential planet , as follows .",
    "we consider a typical @xmath3m@xmath4 planet , we calculate the theoretical value ( retrieved by the models ) of the star / planet contrast , we then place this value on the ordinates of the detection limit curve ( see for example fig.[det_lim1 ] ) and finally we retrieve ( on the abscissae ) the distance beyond which we can affirm that such a planet should not exist ( because it was not detected ) .",

    "for example the fact that no @xmath3m@xmath4 planet was found for @xmath118 of our targets beyond @xmath60 au ( see table[tab4 ] ) means that the likelood for the existance of such planets beyond this distance is @xmath12 @xmath121 @xmath2 i.e. @xmath12 @xmath122@xmath2 . this last estimation is useful for the reader to have an idea of how much the size of the sample affects the statistical results .",
    "we recall that we are using the term _ probability _ in a less conventional way . a precise ( statistically speaking ) definition of _ probability _ should need some positive detection that we obviously do not have .",
    "which are the implications of these results with respect to models such as those cited in section [ intr ] ( gravitational scattering model and outward migration ) , explaining the transfer of planets to large distances ( some tens of au ) from the central star ?",
    "our results indicate that the frequency of planet jumps or outward migration is quite low .",
    "more precisely , it seems difficult for @xmath6m@xmath4 planets to find a stable orbit at distances larger than @xmath88 au , and that @xmath3m@xmath4 planets at distances larger than @xmath123 au , at least in the range of early ages that we considered .",
    "we note that the statistical analysis presented in fig.[prob ] related to the @xmath6m@xmath4 planets is particularly interesting because , due to a steeper cumulative distribution concentrated at small projected separations from the central star , it permits us to better constrain the probability of location of planets .",
    "we also recall that such massive planets are rarely detected at distances smaller than @xmath30 au using radial velocity measurements .",
    "as described in the introduction , the radial velocity technique is sensitive only to planets orbiting at closer distances ( @xmath73 @xmath30 au ) from the central star .",
    "it is interesting to analyse what the direct imaging technique reveals about @xmath6m@xmath4 planets at distances larger than @xmath30 au .",
    "looking at our results , we can state that , for most of the targets ( @xmath12 @xmath124 of cases ) , there are no @xmath6m@xmath4 planets at distances larger than @xmath12 @xmath88 au .",
    "we find that the probability to find planets equal or more massive than @xmath6m@xmath4 at large distances is low as well as the probability to find them at close distances ( @xmath42 @xmath30 au ) as appears from radial velocity surveys ( marcy et al .",
    "massive planets are expected to form beyond the so called _",
    "line _ distance ( @xmath12 @xmath3 au for the solar - like stars au for typical solar - like star .",
    "this distance is calculated for simple thermal equilibrium and is estimated equal to @xmath19-@xmath29 au for late type stars ( black 1980 ) ] ) ( lissauer , 1993 ) and from this distance they might migrate inward .",
    "our study shows that , at least for late spectral type ( k and m ) stars , if such massive ( @xmath12 @xmath6m@xmath4 ) planets form beyond the snow line , we can envisage the following possibilities : * ( 1 ) * massive planets form and can be found in the narrow range of distances _",
    "snow line _ - @xmath88 au from the central star , * ( 2 ) * at distances larger than @xmath88 au only planets having masses smaller than @xmath6m@xmath4 can form and can be found , * ( 3 ) * if any @xmath6m@xmath4 planet would have formed beyond the _",
    "snow line _ , the formation and inward migration necessarily happen on a time scale @xmath42 @xmath6myr .",
    "to test the hypotheses ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) one should improve the contrast at small angular separations . to test the hypothesis ( 3 )",
    "one should select a sample of stars younger than ours .",
    "unfortunately , stars having this property are placed preferably at distances @xmath38 @xmath8 pc from the observer .",
    "even future ground - based planet finders will be able to detect planets only at larger separations ( a few tens of au ) from the central star if the targets are placed at such distances ( @xmath38 @xmath8 pc ) .",
    "for this reason , it would be probably more efficient and appropriate to observe them from space . in this way",
    ", one could by - pass the limitations imposed by the atmosphere on the attainable angular resolution and to probe the same projected separations ( as those analysed in this paper ) from these distant stars .",
    "the resolution reachable in space by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) is not good enough to probe such small physical distances . in a previous study ( brandner et al .",
    "2000 ) , a set of pre - main sequence t tauri stars in the chamaleon t ( @xmath19-@xmath3 myr at @xmath125 pc ) and scorpius - centaurus ob ( @xmath3-@xmath14 myr at @xmath125 pc ) associations were observed .",
    "results showed that at @xmath46 au it would be possible to detect only more massive planets ( @xmath12 @xmath60m@xmath4 ) than those we would detect with naco ( this paper ) .",
    "we should thus wait for a new generation of space telescope to probe such close distances at so early ages .",
    "other interesting issues can be retrieved by our analysis concerning the core - accretion model .",
    "our results provide interesting information concerning mechanisms to explain planet formation .",
    "we are considering here the core - accretion model originally proposed by pollack ( 1996 ) since it provides an explanation for the formation of all gaseous as well as solid planets .",
    "it claims that a growing solid core , after reaching a critical mass , accretes a massive atmosphere . according to our results , this model could work , assuming that massive planets ( @xmath38 @xmath6m@xmath4 ) form in a narrow @xmath3-@xmath14 au distance from the central star in a time scale of @xmath12@xmath25 yr ( typical time scale of disk lifetime ) .",
    "one of the critical aspects of the core - accretion model has always been that it can not explain the presence of planets observed with the radial velocity technique at close distances from the central star .",
    "the time necessary for the formation plus the migration should be longer than the typical disk lifetime ( @xmath12@xmath25 yr , haisch et al .",
    "2001 ) . the modified version of the pollack model , recently proposed by alibert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , seems to solve this problem .",
    "using a detailed description of the composition ( gas plus solid ) of the disk this model reduces the time necessary for a planet to form and migrate by a factor of @xmath6 . with such a modification ,",
    "the process of formation and migration might need a time shorter than the typical disk lifetime .",
    "following the predictions of alibert s model , it would be possible that we did not detect massive planets simply because they formed at ages ( @xmath42 @xmath6myr ) earlier than those of our selected sample .",
    "this means that our results are consistent with the core - accretion model in the alibert formulation .",
    "this model seems thus promising due to the fact that it matches with both observational issues coming from radial velocity measurements and also from direct imaging observations .",
    "we finally mention that our results indicate that a sort of _ exo - planet desert _ for massive ( @xmath12 @xmath6m@xmath4 ) planets is observed at distances larger than @xmath14 au from the stars of our survey .",
    "this desert seems to extend to quite large distances from the central star .",
    "a recent survey ( mccarthy @xmath31 zuckerman , 2004 ) carried out with the near - infrared camera nirc and a coronograph at keck did not detect any @xmath3-@xmath13 m@xmath4 exo - planet in the range @xmath126-@xmath127 au around @xmath12 @xmath128 stars having a mean age of @xmath127 myr .",
    "we would like to mention the relevant improvement in terms of sensitivity reached by our study ( using naco at the vlt ) with respect to previous published results .",
    "a recent analysis of massive planet detection ( neuhuser et al . 2003 ) , carried out with the mpe speckle camera at the eso s @xmath129 m ntt telescope , put an upper limit of @xmath16 au on the distance between the star and @xmath6m@xmath4 exo - planets in the case of targets belonging to @xmath11 pictoris ( @xmath12@xmath13 myr ) .",
    "results from our study show that we can exclude any @xmath6m@xmath4 planets at distances larger than @xmath14 au ( a physical distance @xmath15 times smaller ) for targets belonging to the same moving group .",
    "our results show a better sensititity also with respect to previous observations made with hst ( neuhuser et al .",
    "estimates provided by this study give an upper limit distance between the star and @xmath3m@xmath4 planets of @xmath12 @xmath1 au .",
    "stars observed by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 2002 ) belong to a @xmath12@xmath29myr old systems ( well younger than our sample - @xmath6-@xmath23 myr ) .",
    "models predict a mean difference in h and k band of the order of at least @xmath22 mag between the age of stars in neuhuser et al .",
    "study and ours . we thus deduce that the same instrument ( hst ) would have an upper limit for the star / planet distance quite a bit larger than @xmath1 au for @xmath3m@xmath4 planets in the @xmath6-@xmath23 myr age range",
    ".      how can we improve our results to better constrain planet - formation models ?",
    "it is evident that an increase of the achievable contrast at smaller angular separations shifts the median value of the cumulative distributions to smaller angular separations ( fig.[prob ] ) .",
    "this means that the upper limit of the projected star / exo - planet separation decreases .",
    "however , we note that , using the observational strategy employed in our survey , we can hardly improve the sensitivity at subarcsecond distances using a @xmath21 meter class telescope as illustrated in fig.[sdi_pot ] .",
    "this figure shows the detection limit obtained for one of our targets for an integration time of @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath130 minutes .",
    "the deep image was filtered from low spatial frequencies before we calculated the detection limit .",
    "we observe that , beyond @xmath19@xmath48 , the reachable contrast increases with increasing the integration time ( @xmath12 @xmath19 mag in @xmath14 min ) . at distances smaller than @xmath19@xmath48 , on the contrary , a longer integration time does not increase the contrast because we are strongly limited by the speckle noise .    the differential imaging technique proposed by racine et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is a rather efficient method to reduce the speckle noise at small angular separations from the central star .",
    "images taken simultaneously at slightly different wavelengths are subtracted from each other . since the speckle noise of both images is nearly the same/@xmath131 factor . ] , the speckle noise is eliminated in the resulting image providing one can sufficiently limit static aberrations .",
    "the differential technique finds a useful application in detecting cool methane - rich faint objects .",
    "rosenthal et al .",
    "( 1996 ) first proposed observations of the same star done simultaneously in two different wavelengths which are located _ `` on '' _ and _ `` off '' _ the methane ( ch@xmath70 ) absorption band .",
    "if one subtracts the image taken in the absorption band from the one taken outside the absorption band , planet / brown dwarf features appear in the continuum .",
    "the absorption at @xmath132 @xmath71 m , in the ch@xmath70 band , is a clear signature of any object having temperature t @xmath27 @xmath133 k ( giant exo - planets and t - type brown dwarfs ) .",
    "we can thus increase the sensitivity ( contrast ) at subarcsecond distances using the recently implemented naco / sdi ( simultaneous differential imager ) instrument .",
    "this instrument employs the differential technique in @xmath39 band .",
    "preliminary results ( close et al . 2004 , lenzen et al . 2004 ) indicate a @xmath26 @xmath12 @xmath134 mag at @xmath110 from the central star . considering our averaged estimate of @xmath26 @xmath91 @xmath114 mag in the @xmath39 band ( see section [ sensit ] )",
    ", we should gain @xmath12 @xmath29 mag in contrast using naco / sdi at @xmath110 ( see fig.[sdi_pot ] ) .",
    "a further and fundamental improvement in contrast should be attained by future ground - based `` planet finders '' , i.e. instruments supported by ao systems providing a better strehl ratio .",
    "the contrast reachable by such an instrument at @xmath110 should be @xmath26 @xmath12 @xmath135 mag in @xmath136-@xmath39 bands ( see fig.[sdi_pot ] ) .",
    "we refer in particular to the top level requirements of cheops , a second generation instrument for the vlt conceived for planet detection ( gratton et al .",
    "we think that the principal goals of these instruments ( naco / sdi and ground - based planet finders ) in the context of the detection of massive and young exo - planets and the understanding of mechanisms responsible for exo - planet formation are the following : * ( a ) * they will permit us to provide answers to the hypothesis ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( see section [ dist ] ) . *",
    "( b ) * they will be rather appropriate to do studies similar to the one proposed in this paper but applied to a sample of targets characterized by an earlier spectral type ( i.e. solar - like type ) in the same range of ages .",

    "( c ) * they will be appropriate instruments to detect even fainter exo - planets ( i.e. in the @xmath19-@xmath3 m@xmath4 range ) at subarcsecond angular separations from the central star .",

    "all faint sources found in the vicinity of the central star are presumably background stars .",
    "a detailed estimate of the detection limit in @xmath0 of the observed targets was presented .",
    "this permitted us to calculate the typical contrast ( @xmath26 ) between a planet and a central star at @xmath110 and @xmath19@xmath48 provided by naco for a typical integration time of @xmath60-@xmath46 min ( see section [ sensit ] ) , to present a statistical analysis of the upper limit for the star / planet separation and also to discuss our results in the framework of the mechanisms that are supposed to explain the formation of exo - planets .",
    "our most relevant result is that , in our sample of targets , in @xmath8@xmath2 of cases , no @xmath6m@xmath4 ( and more massive ) exo - planets was detected at distances larger than @xmath9 au and no @xmath3m@xmath4 ( and more massive ) exo - planets was detected at distances larger than @xmath10 au .",
    "if one considers the median values of the cumulative distributions we have that , in @xmath1@xmath2 of cases , no @xmath6m@xmath4 ( and more massive ) exo - planets should exist at distances larger than @xmath7 au and no @xmath3m@xmath4 ( and more massive ) exo - planets should exist at distances larger than @xmath5 au . we emphasize that , these statistical estimates were done for the projected star / exo - planet distance .",
    "we are not considering here the possibility that planets might not be visible in part of their orbit .",
    "our study indicates that massive planets ( mass @xmath38 @xmath3m@xmath4 ) are rare at distances larger than @xmath30 au as well as at distances smaller than @xmath30 au as indicated by radial velocity estimates ( see section [ dist]).we underline that for the category of massive , warm and self - luminous planets that we looked for in our survey , it is not possible to calculate a reliable probability distribution for detecting planets .",
    "the reason is that , to do this , one should need to know the planet frequency distribution _",
    "a posteriori_. this is obviously impossible to do if no - planets have already been detected . for this category of planets , one can only define some merit functions ( depending on several parameters such as the age , the distance from the observer , the magnitude of the central star , the mass of the planet ) to define some criteria to select targets for which the detection should be particularly favourable . for this reason",
    ", we think that it is fundamental to report results ( even of non - detections ) for the category of exo - planets that we are searching for and to try to get as homogeneous analysis as possible of the results in order to improve the statistics of the upper limit for star / planet distance .",
