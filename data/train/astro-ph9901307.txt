    "a generic prediction of hierarchical structure formation models is the existence of large numbers of low mass halos .",
    "the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) predicts that the galaxy mass function , @xmath4 has a steep faint end slope , @xmath5 . numerical simulations ( efstathiou et al . 1988 ; gelb & bertschinger 1994 , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) are consistent with the press - schechter approach : they also predict copious low mass halos .",
    "most galaxy surveys , however , do not seem to find large numbers of low luminosity , low velocity dispersion galaxies .",
    "loveday ( 1998 ) summarizes a number of recent field surveys that find a faint end slope in the range @xmath6 .",
    "groups have similar  flat \" galaxy luminosity functions with slopes typically @xmath7 ( muriel , valotto & lambas 1998 ) . while surveys that reach lower surface brightness limits find more dwarf galaxies ( bothun , impey & mcgaugh 1997 , dalcanton et al .",
    "1998 ) , even the inclusion of these systems does not appear to increase the faint end slope enough to reconcile theory and observation .    in our own local group , where the galaxy inventory is thought to be essentially complete ,",
    "the discrepancy is even more severe .",
    "simulations at the appropriate scale suggest that the local group should contain roughly 1000 objects with velocity dispersions larger than 10 ( klypin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "observers however have only been able to find @xmath8 galaxies in the local group ( mateo 1998 ) .    where are the missing dark halos ?",
    "there is either something wrong with hierarchical structure formation , the numerical simulations , or there are a host of unidentified bound systems in the local group .",
    "what are the likely properties of these low velocity dispersion halos ?",
    "star formation is likely to be inefficient in these low luminosity systems because the cosmological ultraviolet background can prevent or at least delay the formation of atomic and molecular hydrogen ( babul & rees 1992 ; kepner , babul & spergel 1997 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "if these missing galaxies have not formed stars , they likely persist as small bound objects containing mostly ionized hydrogen and possibly a handful of stars .",
    "these dark halos may be the high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "the hvcs are clouds of atomic hydrogen detected primarily by means of their 21-cm emission that can not be in circular rotation about the galactic center .",
    "because they are largely found at high galactic latitude , and because the hi layer of the milky way is so thin , the characteristic distance to the hvcs can , in principle , be anywhere between several hundred parsecs and 1 mpc . in this paper",
    ", we will argue that the evidence points to a local group origin for the hvcs .",
    "oort s ( 1964 ) original idea that the clouds represent infall onto the milky way was abandoned long ago because of the discovery of hvcs with positive galactocentric velocities .",
    "nevertheless , we will argue that his insight that the hvcs represent the unaccreted remnants of galaxy formation is largely correct .",
    "we will also offer some speculations on the implications of the local group origin .",
    "a fuller , more detailed account of the arguments presented in this paper may be found in blitz et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "some of the arguments in this article have already appeared as blitz et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "the flux from hvcs is less than 10@xmath9 of the normal galactic emission . in the outermost parts of the milky way",
    ", a longitude - velocity plot of the normal galactic emission shows that the contours are very nearly sinusoidal . the radial velocity , @xmath10 of the gas in circular orbit around the center obeys :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the circular velocity of a gas parcel at a distance @xmath13 from the galactic center , and where @xmath14 is the distance of the sun from the center .",
    "thus , for gas close to the plane ( cos@xmath15 @xmath16 1 ) , sinusoidal profiles for a flat rotation curve are indicative of gas at constant radius .",
    "conversely , the galactocentric distance of gas along a sinusoid can be inferred from its maximum velocity ( sin@xmath2cos@xmath15 = 1 ) .",
    "longitude - velocity plots from the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) exhibit hi emission with maximum velocities of about @xmath17 170 ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ) , implying that for a flat rotation curve , the hi disk of the milky way extends to a distance of @xmath16 37 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "although most of the hvcs are far from the galactic plane , one large cloud known as complex h ( after aad hulsbosch who has spent years observing and categorizing the hvcs ) , lies directly in the plane and is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the velocity centroid of this cloud is 194 .",
    "if it were within the hi disk , the velocity difference between this cloud and the gas in normal galactic rotation would be between 30200 giving rise to a very large region of highly shocked gas with an energy of @xmath16 10@xmath18 ergs , nearly independent of distance over a large portion of the disk .",
    "this much energy would give rise to a region of disturbed gas in the hi disk at least 25 degrees in extent as well as giving rise to strong h@xmath19 and perhaps x - ray emission , but none of these is evident .",
    "cloud h must therefore lie beyond the hi disk at a distance of at least 40 kpc from the center .",
    "if it is at a distance of 50 kpc , the cloud has a diameter of 20 kpc , and an hi mass of 9 @xmath20 , a huge hi cloud comparable in mass to a dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "if this cloud is typical of the others , then the typical distance of the hvcs will be @xmath16 25 times larger ( since the median angular size of the hvcs is @xmath16 25 times smaller ) and the reservoir of hi locked up in the hvcs is enough to make a milky way - sized galaxy .    [ ! htb ]",
    "-0.6 in    the velocity dispersion and the velocity centroid of the cloud ensemble can also be used to determine what the most appropriate inertial frame of reference is .",
    "a non - inertial frame always gives rise to a larger velocity dispersion than an inertial frame because the former adds a position - dependent velocity in quadrature to each observed radial velocity .",
    "a non - zero velocity centroid suggests that the ensemble is moving relative to the observer .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of the velocities of the hvcs in the lsr and gsr frames of reference ; the latter are much smaller and suggest that the galactic center is a better inertial frame than the local standard of rest .",
    "the mean velocity of 46 @xmath17 7 implies that the galactic center is moving with respect to the barycenter of the ensemble .",
    "if we concentrate on the clouds with negative velocities seen in the lower panel of figure 3 , the centroid of these clouds is close to the local group barycenter ( @xmath2 = 147 , = 25 , @xmath10 = 82 ) .",
    "relative to the lsr , the mean velocity of this group of clouds is 173 , relative to the gsr , it is 88 .",
    "however , relative to a frame of reference centered on the barycenter of the local group , the lgsr , the mean velocity is only 28 @xmath17 10 .",
    "these numbers suggest that the barycenter of the local group is the proper inertial frame for the hvcs and that the milky way is approaching the barycenter at a velocity of about 6090 .",
    "-0.05 in    recently , burton & braun ( this volume ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) have suggested that there is a separate class of hvcs which they call  compact hvcs \" or chvcs that are different from those discussed and analyzed above , but somehow share the kinematic properties of the conventional hvcs .",
    "in fact , the burton & braun clouds are simply a subset of the hvcs compiled by wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) with a few additional clouds that fall between the latter s sampled points .",
    "even though the clouds listed in burton & braun are chosen from the smallish end of the wakker & van woerden sample , the former have a median surface area 1.0 deg@xmath21 compared to 1.5 deg@xmath21 for the wakker & van woerden sample ( blitz et al . 1999 ) , and are not more compact than the typical hvcs .",
    "even this difference may result largely because braun & burton use the beam deconvolved area and blitz et al .",
    "( 1999a ) do not . in any event ,",
    "the small difference hardly warrants a new designation .",
    "apparently , burton & braun have succeeded in showing that a representative subset of hvcs has properties of and behaves similarly to the hvc population as a whole .",
    "the local group is dynamically simple , thus it should be possible to simulate the dynamical history of the hvcs and reproduce both the spatial and kinematic distribution of the clouds . since 98% of the mass of the local group",
    "is in the milky way and m31 , we modelled the local group in blitz et al .",
    "( 1999a ) as a modified , restricted 3-body system with the hvcs as test particles in a potential defined by the galaxy and m31 .",
    "the simulation begins with the hvcs on a regular grid and no initial velocity dispersion .",
    "the milky way and m31 are separated initially by 100 kpc and expand with the hubble flow ; m31 is taken to have twice the mass of the milky way .",
    "enough mass is put into the two galaxies so that they are turned around from the hubble flow until they reach their present separation and velocity of approach .",
    "after the start of the simulation , if a particle comes within 100 co - moving kpc of either galaxy , we assume that the cloud is accreted .",
    "this allows for a somewhat larger interaction radius than the geometric cross - section of the galaxies to allow for gravitational focusing , tidal disruption and dynamical friction .",
    "the basic results of the model are insensitive to the exact value of the relative masses of the two galaxies , or the accretion radius .",
    "the model is exceedingly simple and contains no hydrodynamics ( the test particles are non - interacting ) , though it is not self - consistent in that all of the mass is placed in the two galaxies at t=0 and accretion does not increase the masses of the galaxies .",
    "these shortcomings are compensated by the simplicity of the model .",
    "it contains no free parameters and no fine tuning is done to improve the comparison with the observations .",
    "-0.8 in    -1.6 in -0.2 in    the results are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "figure 3 is a comparison of the simulated and observed spatial distributions of the hvcs with the magellanic stream and the a , c and m complexes removed .",
    "the comparison shows a rather good agreement considering the simplicity of the model .",
    "the model reproduces the two concentrations of clouds , the separation into positive and negative lsr velocities and the tilt in the positive and negative velocity cloud groups relative to the galactic plane .",
    "no extraneous groups of clouds are produced .",
    "no other model considered to date reproduces all of these features of the hvc spatial distribution .",
    "the separation into two groups occurs naturally in the model because the clouds are distributed along a wide filament along the line connecting the milky way and m31 .",
    "the negative lsr velocity clouds are seen along the filament towards the local group barycenter , and the positive lsr velocity clouds are seen primarily in the antibarycenter direction .",
    "both groups are falling toward the lgsr .",
    "-0.2 in    the magellanic stream was removed from the comparison because it is a group of clouds known to be of tidal orgin ( mathewson et al .",
    "1974 ) and is thus not well represented by our model .",
    "cloud c is by far the largest cloud in the hvc ensemble and covers more than 1600 deg@xmath21 .",
    "clouds a and m , which are also quite large , have similar velocities and may be related to this large complex .",
    "if the a , c and m complex is gravitationally bound , it must be tidally unstable and thus quite nearby .",
    "the complex is also very elongated , consistent with tidal shearing .",
    "thus , because of its apparent proximity and tidal shearing , it is also not well represented by our dynamical model and is also excluded from the comparison .",
    "figure 4 is a comparison of the longitude - velocity plot of the observations and the simulations .",
    "again , the magellanic stream and the a , c and m complex are removed .",
    "the simulations reproduce the sinusoidal envelope of the cloud ensemble , the offset toward negative lsr velocities ( due to the motion of the milky way toward the local group barycenter ) and the magnitude of the envelope of the distribution .",
    "this agreement in the quantitative aspects of the @xmath22 distribution are particularly noteworthy because of the absence of free parameters in the model .",
    "if we accept the model at face value , it implies that the hvcs are formed with the earliest structures in the universe and are the building blocks from which the milky way and m31 formed .",
    "the hvcs that we see today would then be the leftover building blocks that have not yet been accreted by either galaxy .",
    "if the local group is not unique , it suggests that structures similar to the hvcs are responsible for _ all _ initial galaxy formation , though there would be large differences in how galaxy evolution proceeds depending on the density of the environment ( see below ) .    if the hvcs are almost as old as the universe , they must be gravitationally bound and tidally stable .",
    "if they have typical distances of 1 mpc as the model suggests , then the observed angular sizes and velocity dispersions imply that to be self - gravitating , about 90% of the matter in the hvcs must be dark ; the dark matter may be either baryonic or non - baryonic .",
    "table 1 gives mean derived parameters for the hvcs .",
    "for example , the clouds could have a 90% ionization fraction , in which case the emission measure would be @xmath23 @xmath24 pc , an undetectable value at present . if the dark matter is the same as that in the halo of the milky way and m31 , the ratio of luminous to dark matter is comparable in the hvcs and the galaxies , just what one would expect if the milky way and m31 were assembled from hvcs . in this case , the hvcs would also have characteristic masses of @xmath25 , similar to the mini - halos postulated by ikeuchi ( 1986 ) and rees ( 1986 ) to be the first structures to form after recombination .    .mean",

    "extragalactic analogues of the hvcs have been seen toward a number of galaxies .",
    "a list of such clouds is given in table 2 .",
    "these clouds were found serendipitously in the course of mapping other objects . many are seen in projection against other galaxies , some are seen as distinct objects separated in both position and velocity from the parent galaxy .",
    "such clouds would appear as hvcs if viewed from the target galaxy .",
    "clearly numerous extragalactic hi clouds have been found with properties similar to those of the hvcs given in table 1 .",
    "+ several blind surveys of hi have been undertaken , notably by zwaan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and more recently by spitzak & schneider ( 1999 ) . in the zwaan et al .",
    "survey , no extragalactic analogues were found without optical counterparts .",
    "spitzak & schneider found one cloud without an optical counterpart . neither survey is particularly sensitive to hi masses typical of what we expect from extragalactic hvcs , though a few probably should have been detected in the zwaan et al .",
    "survey if it is as sensitive as was claimed .",
    "it is difficult to predict how many hvc analogues should be detected since the number associated with a galaxy group or cluster probably depends sensitively on the density of the environment .",
    "it is therefore difficult to assess whether the non - detections in the blind searches ( except for spitzak & schneider ) are significant .",
    "a targeted , high sensitivity survey in the direction of a good local group analogue might well decide this issue .",
    "h@xmath19 has been detected toward clouds a , c and m ( tufte et al . 1998 ) as well as toward the magellanic stream ( weiner & williams 1996 ) .",
    "there is some question of whether the emission toward the magellanic stream is due to photoionization from the galactic ionizing radiation that leaks out of the plane of the milky way , or is due to shock heating from the clouds as they pass though the diffuse gas in the galactic halo .",
    "however , regardless of what produces the h@xmath19 , hvcs that are of local group origin should have lower emission measures than those detected toward either cloud complex .",
    "the h@xmath19 measurements are a critical test of the local group model and observations toward the very high velocity clouds ( @xmath26 ) should give emission measures no higher than @xmath27 0.1 @xmath24 pc .",
    "measurements are currently underway by the wisconsin group using their wham instrument , by a maryland  carnegie group and by a group in australia . if the hvcs are galactic ( distances @xmath28 50 kpc ) , their h@xmath19 surface brightnesses should be at least as large as those already detected .",
    "results should be available within the next year .",
    "the low metallicity , pressure and density detected along several lines of sight support a local group origin .",
    "the detection of extragalactic hi clouds with properties similar to those inferred if the hvcs are local group objects suggests that such clouds do exist in intergalactic regions .",
    "the relative paucity of hvc analogues seen in blind hi surveys may simply be a result of insufficient sensitivity or sky coverage , and more sensitive observations perhaps directed toward poor galaxy groups might usefully be undertaken .",
    "h@xmath19 measurements will provide a critical test which should be able to distinguish between galactic or extragalactic locations for the hvcs .",
    "one possibility other than a local group origin for the hvcs is that the clouds are extensive tidal debris from either previous passages of the magellanic clouds or other nearby dwarfs .",
    "bland - hawthorne et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently suggested that the so - called `` smith clouds '' are related to tidal streaming associated with the passage of the sgr dwarf ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) .",
    "however , an important constraint on tidal models is the crossing time for hvcs which can be written as follows :      where r@xmath30 is the distance from the galactic center in kpc and @xmath31v is the fwhm of the hi line averaged over the cloud .",
    "the mean value of @xmath31v for the hvcs is 30 , and the median value of @xmath32 is 1.5 deg@xmath21 ( blitz et al .",
    "thus the crossing time for a typical hvc is about 1 myr / kpc , or about 50 myr at the distance of the magellanic clouds .",
    "hvcs at that distance can not be gravitationally bound ( except perhaps for complex c , h and the anticenter complex ) .",
    "clouds at 50 kpc therefore double in size in a crossing time which corresponds to a decrease in density of an order of magnitude .",
    "thus hvcs from a tidal origin should not be able to survive for more than 1  2 crossing times .",
    "the orbital time for the magellanic clouds is about 200 myr , far too long for hvcs to have been the result of a prior passage .",
    "the magellanic stream itself has a much larger @xmath32 than the typical hvc and thus has a longer crossing time .",
    "nevertheless , the magellanic stream is identified over only about 1/4 of the sky , suggesting that even those hi clouds are destroyed in about 50 myr .",
    "no other dwarf companions are close enough to the milky way to have produced the extensive tidal debris that would be necessary to explain the hvcs .",
    "the galactic fountain model postulates that the hvcs are hi clouds which have condensed from gas expelled into the halo by supernovae and stellar winds ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) .",
    "it has long been known that the galactic fountain model can not produce hi clouds with radial velocities in excess of the circular speed of the galaxy of about 220 .",
    "many hvcs have significantly larger velocities .",
    "furthermore , the recent evidence for low hvc pressures and densities , the low metallicities , and the inability of the fountain models to reproduce the observed features seen in figures 3 and 4 make the galactic fountain untenable for the majority of hvcs . nevertheless , even the local group model seems to produce insufficient numbers of clouds at low lsr velocities ( clouds near v@xmath33 = 100  see figure 4 ) .",
    "some of these clouds are not fully separated in velocity from the main galactic emission and may therefore yet be part of the normal galactic emission or a galactic fountain phenomenon . just as h@xmath19 measurements become a good test of the local group origin for the hvcs , it may be that the lower velocity hvcs will be relatively bright h@xmath19 emitters .",
