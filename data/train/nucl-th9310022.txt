    "in a previous paper@xcite , we investigated dilepton production associated with minijet final state radiation in heavy ion collisions at collider energies , using dilepton fragmentation functions which can be evaluated perturbatively .",

    "energies , the associated dilepton production becomes dominant over a relative large range of the invariant mass .    due to the relatively large invariant dilepton mass , @xmath2 , the radiative corrections are calculable in pqcd up to all orders in the leading logarithm approximation .",
    "collinear approximation is also used in convoluting the obtained dilepton fragmentation functions with minijet cross sections to compute the radiative contributions to dilepton production . since there exist monte carlo simulations of qcd cascading @xcite which can take into account many other effects , like multiple ladder structure , it is important to check our semi - analytical approach with realistic monte carlo simulations . in this way",
    ", we can address the validity of the approximations we made in the fragmentation function approach @xcite .",
    "to directly simulate dilepton production in a monte carlo event generator is rather difficult due to the small qed coupling constant as compared to that of qcd . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", one can multiply the number of specific qcd processes , which resemble those of dilepton production by an appropriate ratio of the corresponding differential probabilities , as has been tried by geiger and kapusta @xcite .",
    "however , the problem is more complicated than one might first think . for radiative dilepton production",
    ", one has to take into account the fact that the corresponding radiated quarks and gluons in qcd can have further bremsstrahlung which is different from the qed case .",
    "the additional bremsstrahlung gives rise to an extra sudakov form factor and one must include it in the differential ratio to give the correct dilepton emission .",
    "we will derive a formula for the differential ratio and demonstrate that the resultant simulation is consistent with our previous semi - analytical calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem of simulating direct dy process among qcd processes lies in how to take into account higher order , @xmath3 , corrections .",
    "we will discuss when an overall @xmath4 factor , as used in most monte carlo simulations of qcd hard processes in hadronic and nuclear collisions , is sufficient enough to simulate the qcd contributions .",
    "we also consider how possible double counting can be avoided .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss how to calculate the differential ratio to obtain dilepton emission from a monte carlo simulation of the corresponding pqcd processes . in section iii",
    ", we will discuss how to simulate direct dy processes , especially how to take into account higher order corrections .",
    "the results of our simulation will be compared to semi - analytical calculations in section iv , and finally , a summary with some discussions is given in section v.",
    "if a monte carlo generator does not have the qed processes built in , one can calculate the absolute cross sections of the qed processes by scaling the differential cross sections of certain types of qcd processes .",
    "the scaling factor however depends on both the qed and qcd processes . for dilepton production through bremsstrhlung",
    ", one would naively think that a scaling factor between virtual photon and virtual gluon radiation processes from a quark line is enough . however , the probability to find a virtual gluon with fixed invariant mass depends on the probability that the gluon does not have any further radiations to degrade its virtuality .",
    "one therefore should use the scaling factor between process ( a ) and processes ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",

    "the monte carlo simulation of qcd cascading is carried out by giving for each vertex of the radiation tree , such as those in fig .",

    "the contribution of qed processes to the sudakov form factor is negligible .",
    "based on the above probability distributions , we can write down the differential probability for a quark to radiate _ either _ a @xmath27 pair _ or _ two gluons via an intermediate virtual gluon with invariant mass @xmath28 , as shown in figs .

    "since @xmath26 is the actual virtuality of the quark line preceding the gluon radiation and the daughter quark line has at least virtuality of @xmath30 , the maximum value of the gluon virtuality , @xmath31 , is then @xmath32 . due to the same reason ,",

    "[ fig2 ] , the ratio @xmath37 is therefore enhanced relative to both the case when @xmath44 and to @xmath40 by the inclusion of sudakov form factors .",
    "the enhancement increases with @xmath38 as expected due to the increasing branching probability .",
    "similar to the dilepton fragmentation functions , the ratio is very sensitive to the scale @xmath38 .",
    "we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] how we choose @xmath38 which is consistent with the monte carlo simulation of qcd cascading .",
    "when sudakov form factors are set to unity , the dependence of the ratio on @xmath38 only comes from the @xmath10 and @xmath26 dependence of the running strong coupling constant . if both @xmath14 and @xmath45 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] are replaced by @xmath31 , the ratio @xmath46 becomes larger and is independent of @xmath38 as shown in fig .",
    "it is relatively easier to simulate the lowest order process of direct drell - yan by multiplying the differential cross section of @xmath47 by the ratio @xmath48 it is more subtle , however , to include qcd corrections .",
    "these higher order corrections which give rise to a so - called @xmath4-factor have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the problem here is how to include this @xmath4-factor in scaling qcd processes to obtain the dy cross sections .",
    "the first order correction to dy process in qcd comes from the `` annihilation '' @xmath49 , the `` compton '' @xmath50 process and the virtual corrections @xcite .",
    "like in deeply inelastic lepton nucleon scatterings ( dis ) , there are infrared singular and finite contributions from these corrections .",
    "the infrared singular and part of the finite terms can be absorbed into the quark and antiquark distribution functions which are defined in dis processes and should be evaluated at the scale of @xmath31 according to altarelli - parisi evolution equations @xcite .",
    "what are left over are finite and scheme - independent contributions from the higher order corrections .",
    "one can find detailed discussions in , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite .",
    "what we want to point out here is that the dominant contribution to the @xmath4-factor of about 2 in the ( @xmath51-integrated ) mass spectrum of the direct dy is from the virtual corrections .",
    "the contributions from real corrections which depend on both the quark and gluon distribution functions are relatively very small .",
    "therefore , as a first approximation , we can include higher order corrections to direct dy process in our simulation by multiplying the qcd cross sections of @xmath52 by an effective @xmath53 factor .",
    "this @xmath4 factor in principle now includes both real and virtual corrections .",
    "the quark distribution functions in the cross section should be evolved and evaluated at scale @xmath31 .    in the monte carlo simulations",
    ", one could also include the real qcd - corrections explicitly to dy process by counting the number of similar qcd processes , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and scaling them by some calculable ratio as has been done in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , one still has to include the virtual corrections which can be characterized as an effective multiplicative factor , but which now differs from the normal overall dy @xmath4-factor .",
    "this is exactly the problem one has to face if one wants to simulate the @xmath51 distribution of dy dilepton pairs , whose large @xmath51 tail mainly comes from real qcd - corrections .",
    "the lowest order dy process only contributes to the small @xmath51 part of the spectrum by including the intrinsic @xmath51 of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the virtual corrections to the lowest order dy can be taken into account by using an effective ` @xmath4'-factor .",
    "however , one must be very careful not to include the real corrections in this effective ` @xmath4'-factor .",
    "in the monte carlo simulations of qcd processes in hadronic collisions , one usually also uses an effective @xmath4-factor to take into account higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "however , this @xmath4-factor should not be included when one scales the number of @xmath54 and @xmath55 processes by some ratio to calculate the real qcd - corrections to dy process .",
    "otherwise , double - counting may occur .",
    "to perform the monte carlo simulations , we use pythia @xcite subroutines for qcd hard scatterings and the associated bremsstrahlungs as adapted in hijing model @xcite .",

    "a @xmath51 cutoff scale @xmath60 has to be introduced , which will limit the invariant masses of produced dileptons in our simulation . for nuclear interactions ,",
    "binary approximation is assumed for independent hard scatterings .",
    "jet quenching due to final state interaction of produced partons with string - like soft mean - field was also included in the original hijing model @xcite .",
    "we switch off these final state interactions to simplify our study here so that we can compare the numerical results with semi - analytical calculations .",
    "the initial parton distribution functions of a nucleon is taken to be duke - owens parameterization @xcite set 1 .",
    "nuclear shadowing and its scale dependence are also taken into account as in ref .",
    "impact parameter dependence of the nuclear parton distributions is modeled in according to refs.@xcite",
    ". however , at @xmath61 agev , the shadowing effects on the associated dilepton production are small as seen in ref . @xcite .    during the final state radiation",
    ", we count the number of virtual gluons with given invariant mass @xmath28 which are radiated from quark lines .",
    "the maximum virtuality @xmath38 of the quark should be the invariant mass of its parent parton minus the minimum virtuality @xmath62 of its sister parton .",
    "if there is no bremsstrahlung prior to this branching vertex , @xmath5 should be related to the transverse momentum transfer @xmath51 of the corresponding hard scattering . in order to conserve both energy and momentum",
    ", the two produced partons from a hard scattering are combined together in pythia @xcite to initiate final state radiation .",
    "the total virtuality of the two parton system is chosen to be @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig3 ] our semi - analytical calculation of the radiative dilepton production ( solid curve ) which agrees quite well with the simulated result .",

    "the fragmentation function approach has only one branching tree corresponding to a simple ladder structure , whereas the monte carlo simulation takes into account all possible branching trees , thereby enhancing the small @xmath28 dilepton production . in order to be as consistent as possible in both calculations in fig .",
