    "one of the interesting present challenges of @xmath0-manifold theory is to relate ozsvth and szab s celebrated heegaard floer invariants @xcite to the fundamental group . until recently ,",
    "the only known connection ( a very tenuous one ) was an observation of yi ni @xcite , who remarked that knot floer homology @xmath5 detects whether or not the fundamental group of a knot complement has finitely generated commutator subgroup , something one obtains by putting together the deep fact that @xmath5 detects fibred knots ( the main result of @xcite ) with the stallings fibration theorem .",
    "since then , a more substantial connection between these two topics seems to have appeared . recall that a heegaard floer homology @xmath2-space is a closed oriented rational homology sphere @xmath1 which satisfies @xmath6 for all @xmath7 . among the class of rational homology spheres , @xmath2-spaces have the simplest heegaard floer invariants . also , recall that a nontrivial group is said to be left - orderable if and only if it admits a strict total ordering that is invariant under left multiplication ( as a matter of convenience , we declare the trivial group to be non - left - orderable ) . in @xcite ,",
    "boyer - gordon - watson propose the following connection between heegaard floer homology and the fundamental group :    [ lo ] a closed , orientable , irreducible rational homology sphere @xmath1 is a heegaard floer @xmath2-space if and only if @xmath3 is not left - orderable .",
    "there is a growing body of evidence pointing towards the validity of conjecture [ lo ] : it is known to hold for @xmath8 manifolds and seifert - fibered spaces @xcite , and also for graph - manifold integral homology spheres @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are examples and some results in the realm of hyperbolic manifolds which support the conjecture , mostly obtained by surgery on knots in @xmath9 @xcite .    0.1 in it seems plausible that taut foliations constitute the geometry behind conjecture [ lo ] : the conditions in the conjecture may be equivalent to the non - existence of co - orientable taut foliations .",
    "recall that a codimension - one foliation @xmath10 of a manifold @xmath1 is said to be taut if every leaf of @xmath10 meets a loop which is transverse to @xmath10 .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath1 admits a co - orientable taut foliation , then @xmath1 can not be a heegaard floer @xmath2-space @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known that if @xmath1 admits a co - orientable taut foliation , then the commutator subgroup @xmath11 $ ] is left - orderable @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , in all the special cases described above for which conjecture [ lo ] is solved , the connection with taut foliations is also established .    0.1 in in this article , we seek to add to this evidence .",
    "we will consider manifolds which are given by plumbing along a negative - definite weighted tree @xmath12 .",
    "we will denote such manifolds also by @xmath12 , in an abuse of notation ( this should cause no confusion ) .",
    "we will also require that the tree @xmath12 be minimal , that is , no valence - two or valence - one vertices should carry weight equal to @xmath13 ( there is no loss in generality in demanding this , since we can always blow down to bring @xmath12 into minimal form ) . our strategy is to use lattice cohomology @xmath14 , an invariant of negative - definite plumbings introduced by nmethi in @xcite , which is conjecturally isomorphic to the @xmath4 version of heegaard floer homology . in this theory ,",
    "deciding whether @xmath12 is a `` lattice cohomology @xmath2-space '' ( _ i.e. _ whether @xmath15 ) or not can be done fairly simply via a combinatorial procedure known as laufer s algorithm @xcite ( for the reader unfamiliar with this , consult the next section for more details ) . using this combinatorial nature of lattice cohomology , it is fairly easy to construct interesting families of manifolds @xmath12 for which the decision process above is particularly quick and straightforward .",
    "for some large such families , we study the left - orderability of their fundamental group , and prove that they support conjecture [ lo ] . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the lexicon required in part to state our main results :    let @xmath12 be a weighted graph , and let @xmath16 be a vertex .",
    "let @xmath17 be the integer weight associated with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 to be the number of neighbours of @xmath18",
    ". then    1 .",

    "2 .   a vertex @xmath18 such that @xmath21 is said to be a leaf .",
    "3 .   a vertex @xmath18 such that @xmath22 is said to be a bamboo .",
    "4 .   a vertex @xmath18 such that @xmath23 is said to be a node . 5 .   if @xmath24 , @xmath18 is said to be good .",
    "if @xmath25 , @xmath18 is said to be bad . 7 .",
    "it @xmath26 , @xmath18 is said to be very bad .",
    "[ insu ] suppose that @xmath12 is a negative - definite plumbing tree with no very bad vertices , subject to the following conditions :    1 .   every good vertex @xmath18 satisfies @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of bad vertex neighbours of @xmath18 .",
    "no two bad vertices are neighbours .",
    "then , @xmath12 is said to be insulated .",
    "let us emphasise once again that we only concern ourselves with negative - definite trees .",
    "our main results are the following :    [ a ] if @xmath12 has a very bad vertex , then @xmath29 is left - orderable .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 admits a co - orientable taut foliation , and therefore is not a heegaard floer homology l - space .",
    "[ b ] suppose that @xmath12 contains a proper negative - definite @xmath30 subgraph .",
    "then , @xmath29 is left - orderable .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 admits a co - orientable taut foliation , and therefore is not a heegaard floer homology l - space .",
    "these two results are false if one drops the negative - definite condition , as can be seen in the examples below .",
    "the example on the left represents the poincar homology sphere @xmath31 , and it is well - known that this manifold is an @xmath2-space and that its fundamental group is not left - orderable ( this group is finite , and it is easy to see that left - orderable groups must be torsion - free ) . for the example on the right , we can blow down the @xmath32 leaf to obtain a negative - definite configuration , and it can be checked easily that this is a heegaard floer homology @xmath2-space , and that its fundamental group is not left - orderable ( see theorem [ stipi ] in the next section ) .    on the converse statement in conjecture [ lo ] , we prove the following :    [ c ] suppose that @xmath12 is insulated . then , @xmath29 is not left - orderable .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 is a heegaard floer @xmath2-space .",
    "the following graph is insulated :        it is perhaps worth pondering upon the strength of theorem c _ i.e. _ how restrictive the insulation condition is .",
    "it is easy to see that if two bad vertices are neighbours , then @xmath12 is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space , so that if one drops condition _ 2 _ in definition [ insu ] , and if one believes in conjecture [ lo ] and that lattice cohomology is isomorphic to heegaard floer homology , the conclusion of theorem c should no longer hold .",
    "moreover , if we have a good vertex @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 , then @xmath12 is also not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space , so similar remarks apply . in the `` critical '' case @xmath35",
    ", the answer can be extremely subtle and `` non - local '' , in the sense that different regions of the graph interact in a possibly very complicated manner , so that it becomes impossible to characterise lattice cohomology @xmath2-spaces in terms of local conditions on the vertices .",
    "thus , we like to think of the insulation condition as somehow the most general local condition that can be put on the vertices to ensure that @xmath12 is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "0.1 in this article is organised as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the relevant background in lattice cohomology , with an emphasis on how to detect lattice cohomology @xmath2-spaces .",
    "we also recall several previously known results on left - orderability of @xmath0-manifold groups and taut foliations , which will be crucial for the proofs of theorems a and b. finally , in section 3 , we prove our results stated in the introduction .",
    "we would like to thank andrs nmethi and andrs stipsicz for inspiring conversations and for their interest in this work .",
    "moreover , we would like to acknowledge the work of clay - lidman - watson in @xcite : even though we do not directly use any of their results ( since then , stronger results have appeared in @xcite ) , their paper served as an important source of inspiration for our present work , and was the crux of an earlier version . finally , financial support from the erc ltdbud grant and from the lendlet grant of the hungarian academy of sciences is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "let @xmath12 be a tree ( not necessarily negative - definite ) with @xmath36 vertices , @xmath37 , such that each vertex @xmath38 is decorated with a pair of integers @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "this datum determines a closed , oriented @xmath0-manifold via the following construction : for each vertex @xmath38 , take a circle bundle over a closed , orientable surface of genus @xmath41 and with euler number @xmath42 . from each bundle , remove the regular neighbourhood of @xmath43 circle fibers ( recall that @xmath43 is the number of neighbours of @xmath38 ) .",
    "the result is a collection of bundles over surfaces of genera @xmath41 , punctured @xmath43 times , @xmath44 .",
    "it is a standard fact that these are homeomorphic to @xmath45 . in particular",
    ", we can equip each ( torus ) boundary component @xmath46 of the @xmath38th punctured bundle with a canonical basis for its first homology , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the relevant component of @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is a circle fiber .",
    "we then glue two punctured bundles along boundary components if and only if the corresponding vertices are joined by an edge in @xmath12 . on each boundary component , this gluing is determined by a matrix @xmath51 , once a basis for the first homology is chosen . with the choice of basis described above",
    ", the gluing matrix is taken to be    @xmath52    for every boundary component .",
    "the manifold that results from this operation is called the plumbing along @xmath12 , and is denoted also by @xmath12 , as stated in the introduction . in particular , there is an associated intersection matrix , also denoted @xmath53 , whose diagonal entries are the euler numbers @xmath42 , and the off - diagonal entries satisfy @xmath54 if @xmath38 and @xmath46 are neighbours , @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "now , it is an easy standard exercise in algebraic topology to show that the manifold @xmath12 is a rational homology sphere if and only if all the genera @xmath41 are equal to zero and the matrix @xmath12 is nonsingular .",
    "if that is the case , we omit the @xmath41 from the decoration of the tree @xmath12 , and this becomes a graph with each vertex decorated by a single integer weight , @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , notice that the intersection matrix determines the manifold @xmath12 .    in terms of jsj decompositions ,",
    "plumbings correspond to manifolds whose jsj pieces consist entirely of seifert - fibered manifolds . in particular , it is easy to see the jsj tori directly from a minimal graph @xmath12 : they are in one - to - one correspondence with edges separating nodes of @xmath12 .",
    "we now describe the elements of lattice cohomology that will be relevant to our work .",
    "this is not intended to be an introduction to the subject ( we do not even present the definition ) , we merely expose the absolute minimum background required for understanding laufer s algorithm . as stated in the introduction ,",
    "lattice cohomology is an invariant introduced by nmethi in @xcite , inspired by the theory of complex normal surface singularities : to a negative - definite plumbing graph @xmath12 , one associates a topological invariant in the guise of a @xmath56$]-module @xmath14 , computed from the plumbing data . just like heegaard floer homology ,",
    "it splits as a direct sum over the @xmath57 structures of the manifold @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , in the case where @xmath12 is a rational homology sphere , we have one further splitting for every @xmath57 structure @xmath58 in @xmath12 ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60/u\\cdot\\mathbb{z}[u]$ ] and @xmath61 is @xmath56$]-torsion .",
    "thus , in analogy with heegaard floer theory , we make the following definition :    suppose that @xmath12 is a rational homology sphere .",
    "if @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , we say that @xmath12 is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "when @xmath12 is a rational homology sphere , it is conjectured @xcite that @xmath64 , for any @xmath63 .",
    "this isomorphism has actually been verified in several instances , the following special case being of interest to us :    [ isoiso ] ( @xcite ) suppose that @xmath12 is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space . then , @xmath12 is a heegaard floer @xmath2-space .",
    "the great advantage of lattice cohomology over heegaard floer homology is its computability . unlike the latter theory ,",
    "whose calculation involves essentially solving a pde , the former can be computed combinatorially . in particular , there is a very simple criterion for characterising lattice cohomology @xmath2-spaces , given by laufer s algorithm , which we now describe : associated to any plumbing we have a lattice , that is , a symmetric bilinear form    @xmath65    which is given , in some basis represented by the individual vertices , @xmath66 , by the matrix @xmath12 . for each vertex @xmath16 , let @xmath67 be the associated basis element . define the canonical vector @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "then , there is a weight function @xmath70 given by    @xmath71    the algorithm is then given by the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath72 2 .",
    "if , at step @xmath38 , @xmath73 @xmath74 such that @xmath75 , define @xmath76 .",
    "if there is more than one @xmath77 satisfying this condition , choose one arbitrarily .",
    "3 .   if , at step @xmath78 , @xmath79 for all vertices @xmath16 , define @xmath80 .",
    "the procedure terminates here .",
    "it was shown by laufer @xcite that the above procedure always terminates ( provided @xmath12 is negative - definite ) , and that the output @xmath81 is independent of the choice of path in the algorithm . in the singularity theory literature",
    "@xmath81 is known as artin s minimal cycle , and it plays an important role in the algebro - geometric study of normal surface singularities . for the purposes of this article ,",
    "though , we will content ourselves with the topological significance of @xmath81 , which is due to nmethi @xcite :    [ nemi ] @xmath12 is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space if and only if @xmath82 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath83 and that @xmath84 , so that if we notice at any step of the algorithm that @xmath85 has dropped , then we may stop there and conclude that @xmath12 is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .    0.1 in for the reader s convenience , a more conceptual and equivalent way to think about laufer s algorithm together with theorem [ nemi ] , which is essentially just unpacking the function @xmath85 in terms of the adjacency matrix ,",
    "is informally described in the following :    1 .   for each vertex @xmath86 ,",
    "compute the deficiency @xmath87 .",
    "2 .   for each vertex",
    "@xmath18 such that @xmath88 , update the deficiency by adding @xmath17 to @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , increase the deficiency of each of the neighbours of @xmath18 by @xmath89 .",
    "3 .   repeat the above two steps ( each time computing the updated deficiency ) until either a ) a vertex of deficiency @xmath90 appears or b ) all vertices have nonpositive deficiency .",
    "4 .   in case",
    "a ) above , @xmath12 is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space . in case",
    "b ) above , @xmath12 is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .    despite its apparent simplicity",
    ", laufer s algorithm can showcase some very subtle behaviour .",
    "the reader is challenged to test it on the next example , lest the problem seem too straightforward .",
    "recall the negative - definite @xmath30 graph , which we present below , together with a labelling of the vertices .",
    "this graph represents the poincar homology sphere .",
    "[ steps ]   graph.,title=\"fig : \" ]    after a staggering 21 iterations , we obtain @xmath91 , and @xmath82 , confirming that the poincar homology sphere is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space , as expected .    as a start to our investigation of the left - orderability conjecture ,",
    "we prove the next result :    [ lattice ] we have the following :    1 .",
    "if @xmath12 has a very bad vertex , it is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "if @xmath12 contains a proper @xmath30 subgraph , it is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "3 .   if @xmath12 is insulated , it is a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "statement _ 1 _ is immediate . to see statement _ 2 _ , first note that if there are two bad vertices either as neighbours or connected by a bamboo chain with weights @xmath92 , then @xmath12 is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "moreover , it is a standard fact that if we have @xmath93 , with minimal cycles @xmath94 and @xmath81 respectively , then @xmath95",
    ". therefore , it suffices to consider the case where there is a single vertex abutting from one of the leaves of the @xmath30 graph .",
    "we will use the labelling of the vertices displayed in the figure above . if there is a vertex @xmath96 abutting from @xmath97 , after 10 steps we see @xmath98 ( this is not the minimal cycle ) , and it can be computed that @xmath99 .",
    "so we may stop here .",
    "if there is a vertex @xmath96 abutting from @xmath100 , then we may stop at @xmath101 , where we see @xmath102 . finally ,",
    "if there is @xmath96 abutting from @xmath103 , we terminate at @xmath104 , also with @xmath105 , thereby finishing the proof of statement _ 2_. statement _ 3 _ is immediate from the `` informal '' description of the algorithm presented above : we do one iteration for each bad vertex , and since each good vertex satisfies @xmath27 , we do not need to perform any further iterations .",
    "the reader is invited to compare the computation in the third subcase in the proof of statement _ 2 _ with the one for the @xmath30 graph to appreciate the subtlety in laufer s algorithm .",
    "theorem [ isoiso ] immediately implies the next result :    [ lati ] if @xmath12 is insulated , it is a heegaard floer @xmath2-space .    since we will be showing theorems a and b through taut foliations , statements _ 1 _ and",
    "_ 2 _ are somehow not needed in hindsight .",
    "however , we decided to include them to emphasise that lattice cohomology was the dynamo of our thought process , and that we certainly would nt have discovered our results without it .      in this subsection , we discuss some known facts about left - orderable groups and taut foliations .",
    "recall the definition of a left - orderable group :    let @xmath106 be a nontrivial group .",
    "we say that @xmath106 is left - orderable if there exists a strict total ordering @xmath107 on @xmath106 with the property that , given any @xmath108 such that @xmath109 , then @xmath110 , for all @xmath111 .",
    "the study of orderable @xmath0-manifold groups was undertaken systematically in a paper of boyer - rolfsen - wiest @xcite . in it ,",
    "the following characterisation is proved :    let @xmath1 be a compact , irreducible , @xmath112-irreducible @xmath0-manifold . then",
    ", @xmath3 is left - orderable if only if there exists a nontrivial homomorphism @xmath113 , where @xmath2 is any left - orderable group .",
    "we remind the reader that we declare the trivial group to be non - left - orderable .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above result is that a compact , irreducible , @xmath112-irreducible @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 with @xmath114 has left - orderable fundamental group ( take the hurewicz homomorphism @xmath115 , then project onto @xmath116 , and notice that the latter group is left - orderable via the standard ordering as a subset on @xmath117 ) .",
    "0.1 in as mentioned in the introduction , taut foliations are important in the study of conjecture [ lo ] .",
    "recall that a codimension - one foliation @xmath10 of @xmath1 is said to be @xmath117-covered if the leaf space of the induced foliation @xmath118 on the universal cover @xmath119 is homeomorphic to the real line . if an @xmath117-covered foliation is also co - orientable , then the action of @xmath3 as deck transformations gives us a representation into the group of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the real line , @xmath120 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath121 is left - orderable .",
    "thus , if one can show that @xmath122 is nontrivial , it follows that @xmath3 is left - orderable .",
    "it turns out that very often it is possible to upgrade a taut foliation to a co - orientable @xmath117-covered foliation .",
    "one particular success story happens in the realm of seifert manifolds : a codimension - one foliation of a seifert manifold is said to be horizontal if it s everywhere transverse to the seifert fibration .",
    "these foliations are very well understood , and are known to be @xmath117-coverd .",
    "in fact , conjecture [ lo ] is solved affirmatively for seifert - fibered manifolds @xcite in the strong sense that the statement about taut foliations is also true .",
    "now , it is also well - known that every seifert fibered rational homology sphere can be given an orientation for which it can be represented as a negative - definite plumbing @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , it is also known in this case that @xmath64 @xcite , for all @xmath63 .",
    "since we will make heavy use of these results together , we summarise them in a single statement :    [ stipi ] suppose that @xmath12 is a seifert - fibered rational homology sphere . then , @xmath12 is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space @xmath123 @xmath12 is not a heegaard floer homology @xmath2-space @xmath123 @xmath29 is left - orderable @xmath123 @xmath12 admits a horizontal foliation .    the concept of horizontal foliation can be extended to graph manifolds in a straightforward manner , as described in @xcite :    let @xmath1 be a graph manifold ( possibly with boundary ) , and let @xmath10 be a codimension - one foliation .",
    "let @xmath124 denote the set of jsj tori , and let @xmath1 have as boundary a collection of tori @xmath125 .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 is transverse to the seifert fibration of each jsj component of @xmath1 , and that @xmath126 is a foliation by simple closed curves , in particular with slopes @xmath127 .",
    "then , we say that @xmath10 is a horizontal foliation detected by @xmath128 .",
    "horizontal foliations are obviously taut .",
    "notice that our definition is slightly more restrictive than the one given in @xcite ( there , a horizontal foliation is not required _ a priori _ to be detected by simple closed curves on the boundary ) .",
    "the nice feature of horizontal foliations on graph manifolds is that we can glue them together piece by piece , thus they are very suited for inductive arguments ( provided we know how to perform the gluing ) .",
    "we also remark that it is shown in @xcite that horizontal foliations are @xmath117-covered , and with nontrivial action on @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , it is shown in lemma 5.5 of @xcite that horizontal foliations on seifert manifolds with orientable surface underlying the base orbifold are co - orientable .",
    "since we will be dealing exclusively with such jsj pieces ( we use bundles over the sphere as the building blocks for @xmath12 ) , it follows easily that our horizontal foliations will be co - orientable .",
    "thus , if we establish the existence of a horizontal foliation on @xmath12 , we get at once left - orderability and exclusion from the heegaard floer @xmath2-space family .",
    "we start by making some elementary but useful remarks on the diagonalisation of @xmath12 .",
    "notice that we work with matrices that have a very special form : if two vertices @xmath18 , @xmath96 , are connected by an edge , then , up to permutation of rows and columns , near the @xmath18 , @xmath96 entries the matrix @xmath12 looks like                    1 .   choose a vertex @xmath18 in @xmath12 , and present @xmath12 as an ordered tree , rooted at @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   starting at each leaf , apply row operations as described above to partially diagonalise @xmath12 into the nodes nearest to the leaves .",
    "3 .   discard the diagonalised part of this matrix , and treat the remaining matrix as the intersection matrix of some tree @xmath138 ( with rational coefficients at the leaves ) .",
    "4 .   repeat steps 2 ) and 3 ) until @xmath18 is reached . put together all the discarded bits .",
    "the result will be a diagonal matrix @xmath139 .    from elementary linear algebra , we know that negative - definiteness is preserved at each step of the algorithm",
    ". moreover , we remark that the result of the procedure depends heavily on the choice of root @xmath18 .                      0.1 in we now describe the topological significance of the de - rationaliser .",
    "suppose that we split a plumbing tree @xmath12 along an edge @xmath144 .",
    "we obtain two trees , each with an obvious marked vertex , and we denote these by @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "topologically , this splitting induces two manifolds with torus boundary , which we also denote by @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "let us consider @xmath145 , for argument s sake .",
    "being a manifold with torus boundary , it makes sense to talk about dehn filling on @xmath145 .",
    "it is then an elementary fact that , in terms of the basis @xmath147 described in section 2 , @xmath148 dehn filling on @xmath145 is represented by the plumbing graph @xmath149 , which is @xmath145 augmented at @xmath18 by a linear chain with weights @xmath150 , where @xmath151 $ ] is the hirzebruch - jung continued fraction expansion of @xmath152 .",
    "we now prove the following lemma , which explains the name de - rationaliser :      [ zerosurgery ] choose @xmath18 as a root for @xmath153 , and let s compute the entry at @xmath18 after the diagonalisation process .",
    "we have a contribution of @xmath155 from the subgraph @xmath145 , and a contribution of @xmath156 from the chain , whence this entry is zero .",
    "that is , we obtain a diagonal matrix with a zero on the diagonal .",
    "since row operations of the type we are performing do nt change the determinant of a matrix , we conclude that @xmath157 .",
    "it is a standard fact that this condition implies @xmath158 , so we re finished .",
    "let @xmath145 be a negative - definite matrix with a marked vertex , @xmath18 .",
    "then , the manifold @xmath159 admits a horizontal foliation .",
    "moreover , the manifold with boundary @xmath145 admits a horizontal foliation detected by @xmath141 ( in terms of the canonical basis @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) .",
    "we prove the claim by induction on the number of nodes .",
    "the one - node case is essentially an old result of eisenbud - hirsch - neumann @xcite , stating that seifert - fibered manifolds over the sphere with @xmath154 admit a horizontal foliation . that @xmath159 is seifert - fibered is clear from the fact that @xmath162 , which in turn follows from negative - definiteness .",
    "moreover , we can think of the core of the surgery solid torus as representing a fiber from this seifert fibration . removing a regular neighborhood of this fiber , and observing that the meridian of the surgery solid torus was represented by the slope @xmath141 ( in terms of the canonical basis @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) , we deduce that @xmath145 has a horizontal foliation detected by the slope @xmath141",
    ".    for the inductive step , let @xmath145 have @xmath163 nodes .",
    "choose a terminal node @xmath164 in @xmath159 , ( _ i.e. _ a node such that deleting all its neighbours results in a disconnected graph with one component having exactly @xmath165 nodes ) , and delete its neighbour leading to @xmath18 , say , @xmath166 .",
    "we obtain a one - node graph @xmath146 and an @xmath165-node graph @xmath167 .",
    "now , it is clear that @xmath168 admits a horizontal foliation , and that @xmath146 admits a horizontal foliation detected by @xmath169 .",
    "now , look at @xmath167 .",
    "it follows from the diagonalisation algorithm described earlier in the section that @xmath170 has @xmath154 . by inductive hypothesis",
    ", this manifold has a horizontal foliation .",
    "moreover , @xmath167 has a horizontal foliation detected by the slope @xmath171 ( in terms of the basis @xmath172 for its boundary component ) . since the gluing matrix is @xmath173 , we can glue together the foliations to obtain our desired horizontal foliation . that @xmath145 admits a horizontal foliation detected by @xmath141 is straightforward .",
    "of course , the proof of lemma [ zerosurgery ] generalises to plumbing matrices which are merely nonsingular .",
    "it seems plausible that one should be able to produce taut foliations detected by boundary slopes in a more general situation ( at least for graph manifolds only with jsj pieces which fiber over a surface of genus zero ) using the methods developed by gabai in the proof of the property r conjecture @xcite , but we decided to keep things simple and content ourselves with what is necessary .",
    "we proceed by induction on the number of nodes , @xmath36 .",
    "recall that the hypothesis is a negative - definite graph with a very bad vertex .",
    "if @xmath174 , then @xmath12 is a seifert - fibered space which is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "theorem [ stipi ] implies the result . for the inductive step , suppose that @xmath12 has @xmath163 nodes .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath12 has a horizontal foliation .",
    "let @xmath18 be a very bad node .",
    "choose a path to an arbitrary neighbouring node , and pick the first vertex @xmath96 after @xmath18 .",
    "split @xmath12 at @xmath144 .",
    "consider @xmath146 , and do @xmath169-surgery . by lemma [ zerosurgery ]",
    ", @xmath175 has a horizontal foliation , detected by @xmath169 .",
    "once again , since @xmath173 , the induced surgery coefficient on @xmath145 will be @xmath171 .",
    "we must now check that @xmath176 is negative - definite with a very bad vertex . since @xmath177",
    ", we may take its continued fraction expansion to consist exclusively of negative numbers , so that to certify that @xmath176 is negative - definite , it suffices to show that the following matrix is negative - definite :      partially diagonalising @xmath12 around @xmath18 , and attacking the @xmath146 subgraph first , one obtains exactly the form written above , so that @xmath176 is indeed negative - definite .",
    "the only thing to worry about now is if the continued fraction expansion of @xmath171 starts with @xmath13 , for then we must put the graph into minimal form by blowing down . doing so will always increase the weight of @xmath18 by one , so that it definitely remains very bad even in this situation .",
    "we can now say that , by inductive hypothesis , @xmath176 has a horizontal foliation .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that @xmath179 has a horizontal foliation detected by @xmath171 .",
    "hence , we may glue together the foliations on @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and the result is established .",
    "once again , we proceed by induction on the number of nodes .",
    "the base case is an application of proposition [ lattice ] , together with theorem [ stipi ] . for the inductive step ,",
    "we suppose once again that @xmath12 has @xmath180 nodes , and a proper @xmath30 subgraph .",
    "the only thing that has to be checked is whether the surgery step after we cut still gives us a proper @xmath30 subgraph .",
    "recall the labelled @xmath30 graph from figure 1 .",
    "there are 4 cases to consider , depending on where we find a piece of @xmath12 abutting from the @xmath30 subgraph .    0.1 in _ case 1 abutting from @xmath181 : _ this case is the easiest .",
    "if there is abutting from @xmath181 , then @xmath12 has a very bad vertex , and the conclusion of the theorem follows at once from theorem a.    0.1 in _ case 2 abutting from the chain @xmath182 : _ our strategy will be to cut at the edge @xmath183 . in doing so , we are stealing from the @xmath30 subgraph , and so we must ensure that the continued fraction expansion of the surgery coefficient for @xmath184 , which is @xmath185 , starts with four @xmath92 and does not strictly end there , in order to obtain a proper @xmath30 subgraph for the inductive step . to verify this",
    ", we estimate the de - rationaliser of @xmath186 at @xmath187 .",
    "first of all , notice that @xmath12 contains the following sub - configuration , and this must be negative definite .        partially diagonalising the graph above into @xmath187 , attacking the side which contains @xmath181 , we calculate that @xmath188 surgery on @xmath186 is still negative - definite .",
    "this places a lower bound of @xmath188 for the de - rationaliser of @xmath186 . to get an upper bound , we diagonalise the subgraph @xmath186 into @xmath187 .",
    "since the contribution coming into @xmath103 is non - negative , we get that @xmath189 receives a contribution @xmath190 from @xmath103 .",
    "the same reasoning implies that @xmath191 now receives a contribution @xmath192 from @xmath189 .",
    "finally , @xmath187 receives a total contribution from its neighbours of @xmath193 , where the inequality is strict since we are assuming that there are some vertices abutting from the chain @xmath182 .",
    "since we want to obtain a @xmath194 at @xmath187 when we add the contribution coming from the de - rationaliser , we immediately obtain the upper bound @xmath195 .",
    "thus , @xmath196 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify , given the bounds above , that the hirzebruch - jung continued fraction expansion of @xmath185 starts with four @xmath92 and does not strictly end there , so that @xmath197 contains a proper @xmath30 subgraph , and the inductive step of the argument can go through .    0.1 in _ case 3 abutting from the chain @xmath198 : _ we cut at @xmath199 .",
    "this time , we must show that the continued fraction expansion of @xmath200 starts with two @xmath92 and does not strictly end there , to obtain a proper @xmath30 subgraph . here , the lower bound for the de - rationaliser",
    "is computed to be @xmath201 .",
    "the upper bound is found to be @xmath202 , whence @xmath203 , which is good enough so that we may proceed .    0.1 in _ case 4 abutting from @xmath100 : _ we cut at @xmath204 .",
    "now , we only need the continued fraction to start with @xmath92 and not strictly end there . using similar methods as above , we obtain the estimates @xmath205 , so that the inductive step can go through in this case .",
    "we ve just verified that the inductive argument can proceed in all situations .",
    "now , the horizontal foliation argument in the proof of theorem a works verbatim for theorem b ( with the property of having a very bad vertex replaced with the property of having a proper @xmath30 subgraph ) , so we are finished .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors establish conjecture [ lo ] for graph - manifold integer homology spheress by successfully constructing a horizontal foliation on any graph - manifold integral homology sphere not homeomorphic to @xmath9 or the poincar homology sphere @xmath31 ( such a foliation can not exist in these two cases ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not hard to construct graph - manifold rational homology spheres without horizontal foliations ( in the stronger sense of our definition ) , so that the strategy of proof of theorems a and b can not work in general . consider the negative - definite plumbing @xmath12 below .",
    "this has a pair of bad vertex neighbours , so a quick check with laufer s algorithm shows that @xmath12 is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space .",
    "moreover , it is even known in this case that @xmath12 is not a heegaard floer @xmath2-space @xcite ( we are thankful to andrs nmethi for pointing this out ) .",
    "we claim that @xmath12 has no horizontal foliations . to see this",
    ", we split @xmath12 along the central edge to obtain two identical graphs @xmath145 , and we will try to build the foliation by gluing it along the seifert - fibered pieces .",
    "notice , by blowing down , that @xmath206 is negative - definite , in fact , homeomorphic to a lens space .",
    "hence , any surgery @xmath207 with @xmath208 gives a manifold which is not a lattice cohomology @xmath2-space , hence without horizontal foliations , by theorem [ stipi ] .",
    "if we do @xmath209 surgery , we need to massage @xmath207 into negative - definite form . using the plumbing calculus , it is easy to show that this involves decreasing the weight of the central node by @xmath210 units , and extending by the continued fraction expansion of @xmath211 . since @xmath212 ,",
    "the continued fraction expansion of @xmath211 does not start with @xmath13 .",
    "we see that @xmath207 can be represented by a minimal negative - definite graph with no bad vertices , so that we can not put a horizontal foliation on it , by theorem [ stipi ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath194 surgery gives a connected sum of lens spaces ( this can be seen by plumbing calculus , or just by standard seifert manifold theory ) , and this is also no good .",
    "we conclude that @xmath145 can not have a horizontal foliation detected by any slope in @xmath213 .",
    "finally , since the gluing matrix @xmath214 takes @xmath152 to @xmath215 , there is no need to study the case @xmath216 .",
    "thus , it is impossible for @xmath12 to admit a horizontal foliation .",
    "let @xmath12 be a be a plumbing along a graph , with vertices @xmath217 and suppose we take only circle bundles over a sphere .",
    "denote the set of edges of the graph by @xmath218 . given a vertex @xmath18 ,",
    "choose a cyclic ordering of its neighbours .",
    "let @xmath219 denote the cyclically ordered set of neighbours of @xmath18 .",
    "then , @xmath29 admits the following presentation :      even though picking different orderings of the neighbours results necessarily in presentations describing isomorphic groups , we are not allowed to change the cyclic ordering once we ve picked a particular presentation .",
    "let us recall the hypotheses of theorem c : we have a negative - definite insulated graph @xmath12 .",
    "we will argue by contradiction , so from now until the end of the proof we will suppose that @xmath29 admits some left - ordering @xmath107 . clearly , we may assume that @xmath12 has at least two vertices ( otherwise , @xmath221 is finite and the result is trivial ) .",
    "now , arbitrarily pick a vertex @xmath222 , and present @xmath12 as an ordered tree , rooted at @xmath222 .",
    "this naturally induces a notion of height along the tree , measured by distance to @xmath222 . for notational convenience",
    ", we will take @xmath222 to be at the `` highest point '' . for a given vertex @xmath181",
    ", we say its descendents are its neighbours at a lower height , and its parent is the ( unique ) neighbour at higher height .",
    "we start by pointing out that it is also true that @xmath227 , so that @xmath228 . if @xmath229 , the result is immediate : @xmath230 , so that @xmath226 .",
    "so we may take @xmath231 .",
    "now , write the group relation at the node @xmath181 .",
    "since neighbours commute , we may write this as              now , since all the factors in brackets with @xmath181 are @xmath238 , we must have the strict inequality @xmath239 . cyclically permuting more and applying the same reasoning with the appropriate relations one obtains the chain          [ goodnode ]",
    "let @xmath12 be an insulated rooted tree , and let @xmath181 be a good vertex .",
    "partition its descendents into bad vertices @xmath243 and good vertices @xmath244 .",
    "suppose that @xmath245 , and that @xmath228 .",
    "let @xmath166 be the parent neighbour .",
    "then ,            it seems that we have forced a specific ordering of the vertices around @xmath181 , but it will be seen from the argument that no loss of generality is incurred by doing this ( and anyway , we are allowed to pick the ordering once ) .",
    "now , @xmath250 , from the insulation hypothesis .",
    "this , together with the other hypothesis of the lemma , implies that            let @xmath12 be an insulated graph , rooted at some node @xmath222 .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is left - orderable .",
    "we will argue inductively along the height of the tree @xmath12 .",
    "we basically want to prove that all vertices satisfy condition @xmath253 .",
    "first , we claim the following :      to prove this , suppose that @xmath254 is trivial .",
    "then , @xmath254 bounds a disk in @xmath12 , which we can take to be embedded , by dehn s lemma .",
    "notice that @xmath254 represents one of the exceptional fibers of one of the jsj components of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath12 is a seifert - fibered space ( _ i.e. _ the graph @xmath12 has one node ) , it is well - known that elements represented by exceptional fibers are nontrivial in the fundamental group ( unless , of course , @xmath12 is @xmath9 , which is precluded by hypothesis ) .",
    "if @xmath12 has more than one jsj component , then the disk bounded by @xmath254 must intersect the corresponding boundary component , by the same reason as above .",
    "this intersection is a collection of parallel closed loops .",
    "a standard innermost loop argument now implies that one of these loops must bound a disk , contradicting the incompressibility of the boundary .",
    "therefore , @xmath254 must be nontrivial in @xmath29 .    0.1 in now",
    ", it is straightforward to verify that if we reverse the inequality signs in the hypotheses of lemmas [ badnode ] and [ goodnode ] , it is possible to reach analogous conclusions , but also with inequality signs reversed ( by reversing inequality signs , we mean permuting right and left - hand sides , of course ) .",
    "if a vertex satisfies either of these `` reversed inequality '' conditions , then we say it satisfies condition @xmath255 .",
    "we then make the following claim :      we prove this by induction on the height of the rooted tree .",
    "first , it is straightforward to verify this for height equal to @xmath89 : let @xmath181 be a vertex at height @xmath89 , and observe that it has at least one leaf neighbour @xmath254 at height @xmath194 . if @xmath181 were trivial in @xmath221 , then the group relations would imply that @xmath256 , for some @xmath257 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath254 is torsion .",
    "since , for irreducible @xmath0-manifolds , having infinite fundamental group implies having torsion - free fundamental group , we see that @xmath181 can not be trivial .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath181 satisfies either condition @xmath253 or @xmath255 .",
    "for the inductive step , suppose that all vertices at height @xmath258 satisfy either of the conditions .",
    "let @xmath259 be a vertex at height @xmath260 .",
    "we observe that all the descendents of @xmath259 must satisfy the same condition .",
    "if that were nt the case , we could show that @xmath261 , which is a contradiction .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , we suppose that the descendents all satisfy condition @xmath253 . if @xmath259 is bad , by insulation hypothesis , all its descendents are good .",
    "the ones that have descendents themselves , say @xmath262 , satisfy lemma [ goodnode ] by inductive hypothesis , so we have indeed @xmath263 .",
    "the descendents that do nt have descendents themselves , say @xmath264 , are leaves , and so we have trivially that @xmath265 , bearing in mind that all weights are at most @xmath92 , since we take @xmath12 to be minimal . we conclude that @xmath259 satisfies condition @xmath253 .",
    "if @xmath259 is good , with bad descendents @xmath266 and good descendents @xmath267 , we clearly have that @xmath268 , since the @xmath269 satisfy lemma [ badnode ] by inductive hypothesis , and also that @xmath270 .",
    "hence , @xmath259 also satisfies condition @xmath253 , and the claim is established .    0.1 in notice that it follows in hindsight that all vertices of @xmath12 satisfy the same condition out of @xmath253 and @xmath255 , since @xmath12 is connected .",
    "without loss of generality , suppose that condition @xmath253 holds everywhere .",
    "this implies that the root @xmath222 is @xmath107-maximal among the generators in the group presentation .",
    "now , presenting @xmath12 as a rooted tree by choosing a different vertex for the root implies that @xmath222 is not @xmath107-maximal , and this is a contradiction .",
