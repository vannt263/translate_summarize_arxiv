    "planet - disk interactions are mediated by resonances , of which there are as many kinds as there are terms in the fourier expansion of the planet s potential .",
    "some resonances damp eccentricity while others excite it .",
    "goldreich & sari ( @xcite , hereafter gs03 ) outlined the circumstances whereby certain resonant interactions could dominate others to excite eccentricity in the net .",
    "the planet would need to ( 1 ) carve out a gap around its orbit , and ( 2 ) have its eccentricity exceed a threshold value , which gs03 estimated to be on the order of a few percent ( see sections 2 and 4.1 for the technical details ) .",
    "amplification of eccentricity by disk torques could then proceed , presumably until the planet crashed into the gap walls .",
    "eccentricities excited by disks would then be limited by the fractional radial widths of gaps , of order @xmath00.1 .",

    "the finite - amplitude instability of gs03 has seen little if any support in numerical studies .",
    "overwhelmingly , planets the mass of jupiter or lower are seen in numerical simulations to have their eccentricities damped . some of these studies found that eccentricities grow only for planets of relatively high mass @xmath8@xmath9 , via a mechanism that differs from the one proposed by gs03 ( see section 2 ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "the one numerical study that reported otherwise was by @xcite who found that jupiter - mass planets could have their eccentricities excited to values of @xmath00.1 .",
    "it is unclear whether their results vindicate the gs03 mechanism , as @xcite observed eccentricities to grow starting from zero ; in other words , no evidence was found for a finite - amplitude instability .",

    "fixed - planet \" methodology : the planet is kept on a fixed eccentric orbit ; the disk is allowed to relax to a quasi - steady state ( one that oscillates consistently with the epicyclic phase of the planet ) ; and disk forces on the planet are then measured to extract the rate of change of planet eccentricity @xmath10 as a function of @xmath11 . the fixed - planet approach , as used by , e.g. , and , permits greater control of environmental variables and more systematic exploration of parameter space .",
    "in section [ sec : theory ] we briefly review the theoretical considerations underlying how disks affect planetary eccentricities . we summarize the tenets of the theory of gs03 and also itemize aspects of the problem that they did not treat .",

    "the appendix compiles all the formulae we used to test gs03 , drawn from several analytic studies .",
    "according to gs03 , eccentricity excitation requires two ingredients :    * the planet must carve a deep enough gap in the disk  or more accurately , a gap with steep enough density gradients  that first - order ( as expanded in the planet s eccentricity ) co - orbital lindblad resonances situated at the very gap center become weaker than first - order external lindblad resonances located roughly a gas scale height @xmath13 away from gap center . the latter drive eccentricity , while the former damp eccentricity . citing calculations by @xcite",
    ", gs03 stated that the gap profile must be such that the surface density at the locations of the strongest externals must be greater than the surface density at gap center by at least a factor of @xmath03 for the externals to defeat the co - orbitals .",
    "* first - order co - rotation resonances , which also damp eccentricity , must be  saturated \" ( weakened ) , meaning that material librating in co - rotation resonance must not be replenished by viscous inflow of fresh material @xcite .",
    "saturation is effected for sufficiently large @xmath14 ; in other words , eccentricity excitation is a finite - amplitude instability .",
    "as estimated by gs03 , the minimum eccentricity necessary for @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the planet - to - star mass ratio , @xmath18 is the planet s semimajor axis , @xmath19 is the planet s orbital frequency , @xmath20 is the gap width , and @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity . to estimate @xmath20 , gs03 balance the one - sided principal ( zeroth - order ) lindblad torque with the local viscous torque @xmath22 and",

    "these authors replaced the left - hand @xmath24 with @xmath26 , the right - hand @xmath24 with the unperturbed value @xmath27 , and @xmath20 with @xmath13 to arrive at a fairly accurate formula for @xmath28 .",
    "their argument and gs03 s argument for @xmath20 as presented here are not obviously compatible . ]",
    "we will , in any case , test scaling relation ( [ eq : width ] ) numerically in section 4.3 . substituting ( [ eq : width ] ) into ( [ eqn : emin ] ) gives @xmath29 for our standard parameters of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( corresponding to a shakura - sunyaev @xmath32 and disk aspect ratio @xmath33 ) , equation ( [ eqn : emin ] )  which is not meant to be more than an order - of - magnitude estimate  gives @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath14 , a reasonable expectation not specifically discussed by gs03 is that the eccentricity should grow until the planet s radial epicyclic motion causes it to collide with the gap walls .",
    "the maximum eccentricity @xmath35 should then scale as @xmath36 .",
    "comes into play , the disk aspect ratio @xmath37 becomes relevant .",
    "see section [ sec : anly ] on the supersonic weakening of lindblad resonances and how the weakening leads to @xmath35 . ]    a useful order - of - magnitude formula that gives a sense of scale is the maximum rate of eccentricity damping in the limit of small @xmath11 and no gap clearing @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath27 is the unperturbed disk density .",
    "this maximum rate of eccentricity change is set by the co - orbital resonances .",
    "gap clearing can only reduce the magnitude of eccentricity changes ( and potentially change the sign ) .",
    "apsidal resonances are first - order lindblad resonances with pattern speeds equal to the planet s apsidal precession frequency ( they have wavenumbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the fourier notation of @xcite ) .",

    "circumplanetary material ( not necessarily bound to the planet ) may exert dynamical friction and strongly damp the planet s eccentricity .",
    "properly modeling circumplanetary flows is challenging and subject to numerical issues such as how the planet s potential is smoothed and how accretion onto the planet is prescribed .",
    "another nonlinear issue concerns instabilities in deep gaps @xcite .",
    "if the planet mass is large enough or the viscosity is small enough , then gap walls can steepen to the point of triggering the rayleigh instability or the rossby wave instability .",
    "gap walls can shed vortices that can stochastically torque the planet .    finally , we emphasize that the gs03 mechanism for eccentricity growth does not align with the common view that to drive eccentricity requires near - brown dwarf masses and the dominant influence of the outer 1:3 lindblad resonance . , @xcite , and",
    "found eccentricity driving only for relatively massive giants ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) ; these companions opened such wide and deep gaps that they interacted primarily with their disks via the outer 1:3 resonance , amplifying disk eccentricities which were then backreactively shared with the planet by secular interactions ( see also ) . found eccentricity growth for 510 @xmath42 planets only when such planets were forced to occupy substantially eccentric orbits , @xmath430.4 ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "we will find in the present study that the 1:3 resonance is not essential for eccentricity driving ; that it is possible to excite planetary eccentricities even for jupiter - mass planets , starting with eccentricities as low as a few percent , along the lines envisioned by gs03 .",
    "we address the problem of eccentricity evolution numerically by integrating the 2d ( vertically integrated ) isothermal hydrodynamic equations :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath24 is surface density , @xmath47 is pressure , @xmath48 is velocity , @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath49 is the sound speed , and @xmath50 is the gravitational potential from the planet and central star .    the numerical integration is carried out using the disco code @xcite .",

    "the planet lives on a fixed eccentric orbit of semimajor axis @xmath18 and eccentricity @xmath11 ( figure [ fig : pretty ] ) .",
    "the code is run until the disk surface density relaxes to a pattern that varies repeatedly and consistently with the planet s epicyclic motion ; typically this takes thousands of planetary orbits ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "the instantaneous value of @xmath78 follows from the definitions of the planet s orbital angular momentum and energy :    @xmath79    @xmath80    combining the time derivatives of these two quantities ( and remembering that @xmath81 depends on @xmath18 ) yields    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath47 are the torque and power delivered to the planet , respectively :    @xmath84    @xmath85    the planet s velocity is @xmath86 and the disk s gravitational force on the planet is    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the unit vector pointing from the planet to the grid cell of area @xmath89 . the planet s migration rate can also be calculated via    @xmath90",

    "* for the largest values of @xmath11 considered , @xmath10 plunges to large negative values . here",

    "figure [ fig : adot ] plots the migration rate @xmath102 for our standard model . note that in contrast with @xmath78 , the migration rate does not depend sensitively on @xmath11 , at least until @xmath103 and the planet crashes into the gap walls .",
    "the substantial damping of eccentricity for @xmath104 found in figure [ fig : edot ] coincides with a large , positive migration rate in figure [ fig : adot ] , similar to what was observed in the live - planet study of @xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this fast outward migration is only sustained as long as the eccentricity is this large .",
    "in reality the eccentricity should be quickly damped to @xmath105 ( figure [ fig : edot ] ) , whereupon @xmath106 as usual .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma ] shows the gap depth @xmath107 for this system .",
    "gap depth is computed by calculating the azimuthally averaged and time - averaged surface density as a function of radius , @xmath108 , and finding the minimum of this function .",
    "a region of radius @xmath109 centered on the planet s guiding center at @xmath110 is excised from the azimuthal average , in order to avoid contamination from material very close to the planet .",
    "increasingly eccentric planets have shallower gaps .    in the next section ,",
    "we elaborate upon all the trends highlighted above .",

    "they depend on surface density @xmath112 and its slope @xmath113 ; these two quantities are read directly off snapshots of the numerical solution , so in this sense our calculation is semi - analytic . ) , the equations in the appendix give a value for @xmath114 that matches that of equation ( [ eqn : edote ] ) to within @xmath020% , after adjusting the strength of the softening term in the generalized laplace coefficient . ]",
    "a sampling of surface density profiles @xmath108 vs.  @xmath11 is provided in figure [ fig : sigma_prof ] , overlaid with the locations of some of the more important resonances .",
    "each surface density profile is taken from an individual snapshot in time , azimuthally averaged after excising a circular region of radius = @xmath109 centered on the planet s guiding center at @xmath110 .",
    "the excised region contains large and highly time - variable overdensities in the immediate vicinity of the planet that the analytic theories  which govern small disturbances on a smooth background  were not intended to treat .",
    "we will see at the end of this section that torques from this excised region are significant in some regions of parameter space .",
    "the contributions to @xmath10 from the various resonances are dissected in figure [ fig : semi ] ( top panel ) . as anticipated by gs03 ,",
    "the strongest resonances are the first - order lindblad external resonances which excite @xmath11 , and the first - order co - rotation resonances which damp @xmath11 .",
    "the first - order lindblad co - orbital resonances also damp @xmath11 , but are weaker because they are situated in the dead center of the gap where surface densities are at their lowest .",
    "principal lindblad resonances contribute negligibly to @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : cumu ] shows that wavenumbers @xmath1158 contribute most to @xmath10 ; contributions from higher @xmath116 , up to our assumed cut - off at @xmath117 , are less important .",
    "the broad similarity between our semi - analytic calculation ( figure [ fig : semi ] , top panel ) and our numerical results ( figure [ fig : semi ] , bottom panel ) emboldens us to give the following interpretation of the dynamics . as @xmath11 increases from 0 , @xmath10 switches from negative to positive .",
    "this first zero crossing is the finite - amplitude instability of gs03 and @xcite .",
    "the instability results because the first - order co - rotation resonances ( which damp @xmath11 ) weaken from increasing saturation with increasing @xmath11 ",
    "i.e. , they weaken following the @xmath118 saturation function ( see appendix equations [ preog03][og03 ] , plus the discussion at the end of this subsection ) . above a threshold @xmath11 ,",
    "the co - rotation resonances give way to the first - order lindblad external resonances which render @xmath10 positive in the net .",
    "further increases in @xmath11 , however , bring @xmath10 back down to a second zero crossing .",
    "the external resonances weaken as @xmath11 exceeds @xmath119 , i.e. , as the planet s epicyclic motion becomes supersonic @xcite .",
    "the consequence of this supersonic weakening with increasing @xmath11 is that the first - order co - rotation resonances  which are unaffected by supersonic motion  together with the first - order lindblad co - orbital resonances regain the upper hand at large @xmath11 to make @xmath120 .",
    "although the co - orbital lindblads suffer from the same supersonic weakening as do the external lindblads , the co - orbitals yield a ( negative ) value of @xmath121 that hardly varies with @xmath11 ; their weakening is mitigated by the surface density at gap center which grows with @xmath11 ( figures [ fig : sigma ] and [ fig : sigma_prof ] ) , maintaining the strength of the co - orbitals .",
    "perhaps the most glaring discrepancy between our semi - analytic and numerical results is at the largest values of @xmath11 .",
    "numerically , at @xmath122 , we find eccentricity damping rates that are substantially higher than those expected from theory .",
    "as the bottom panel of figure [ fig : semi ] indicates , the large negative values of @xmath121 are generated from torques exerted by ",
    "circumplanetary \" material  here defined as material within 1 hill radius of the planet s instantaneous position ( the circumplanetary region so defined is a subset of the excised region used to calculate azimuthal averages of surface density ) .",
    "the dominance of circumplanetary torques is not surprising at large @xmath11 : the epicyclic motion is so wide that the planet collides with the gap walls and suffers dynamical friction from high density gas .",
    "what is surprising is that circumplanetary torques also dominate at the smallest value of @xmath123 , rendering @xmath10 more negative than expected from theory and pushing the onset of the eccentricity instability to larger @xmath124 ( figure [ fig : semi ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the properties of the circumplanetary region are uncertain and can not be reliably predicted from linear theory . in our numerical calculations , details of the circumplanetary flow",
    "are subject to such issues as grid resolution , smoothing length , and prescriptions for how the planet accretes .",
    "returning to the first zero - crossing for @xmath10 as computed semi - analytically ( top panel of figure [ fig : semi ] ) , we reiterate that it occurs because of co - rotation saturation , as quantified by @xmath118 ( equation [ og03 ] ) .",
    "this saturation function from @xcite ( called @xmath125 by them ) decreases with increasing @xmath11 ; it causes the @xmath126 symbols in the top panel of figure [ fig : semi ] to approach zero as @xmath11 increases .",
    "physically , @xmath118 describes how the co - rotation torque weakens as viscous diffusion is increasingly unable to supply the co - rotation region with fresh librating material .",
    "the saturation function is separate from the surface density gradient @xmath111 ( really vortensity gradient ) which also factors into the strength of the co - rotation torque ( equation [ dsdr ] ) .",
    "the surface density gradient at the location of a co - rotation resonance also decreases as @xmath11 increases ( see figure [ fig : sigma_prof ] ) , but the decrease in @xmath111 , in and of itself , is not as significant as the decrease in @xmath118 . we have shown this by re - computing @xmath121 vs.  @xmath11 using the single surface density profile @xmath108 evaluated for @xmath123 , and obtaining a curve similar to the one shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : semi ] .",
    "figure [ fig : param ] shows results for @xmath12 for our six disk - planet systems scattered across parameter space .",
    "the observed changes to @xmath12 are complicated and difficult to follow in detail .",
    "we performed the same semi - analytic analysis for these models as we did for our standard model ( section [ sec : anly ] ) , and were able to reproduce only some of the trends documented in figure [ fig : param ] .",
    "part of our difficulty stemmed from circumplanetary torques which often proved significant , and which we could not evaluate using the standard analytic theory .",
    "broadly speaking , however , we can say that @xmath127 favors high - mass planets , thin disks , and low viscosities  these cases are highlighted in red in figure [ fig : param ] .    qualitatively , the circumstances that lead to @xmath15 are the same ones that produce deep gaps .",
    "gap depths are gauged by the dimensionless parameter @xmath128 @xcite and it is interesting to ask whether this same parameter can predict eccentricity growth .",
    "figure [ fig : k ] lists values of @xmath129 for our seven disk - planet parameter studies , together with @xmath129-values from previous studies of eccentricity evolution . a rough threshold of @xmath130@xmath131 dividing @xmath132 from @xmath15 can be discerned  equivalent to a threshold gap depth @xmath133 .",
    "the width of a gap opened by a planet gives a hard upper bound on the eccentricity that can be excited by disk torques . as such , it is worthwhile understanding how the gap width @xmath20 depends on input parameters .    the exercise performed in section 2 predicts that @xmath134 . this relation is tested in figure [ fig : width ] where gap half - widths are plotted against the dimensionless parameter @xmath135 .",
    "the gap half - width is evaluated by differencing the radii at which @xmath136 and dividing by two .",
    "the data in figure [ fig : width ] appear to conform to a power law , but with a somewhat shallower slope than the predicted 1/3 : @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the gap half - width .    for our standard model parameters ,",
    "the above fitting formula gives @xmath139 . by comparison ,",
    "the eccentricity beyond which @xmath10 plummets to large negative values ( see figure [ fig : edot ] ) is @xmath140 ; this is a factor of 2 smaller than @xmath141 and suggests that in this context , a more relevant definition for gap half - width would be obtained by taking @xmath142 rather than @xmath143  see figure [ fig : sigma_prof ] .",
    "we close with the reminder that the actual value to which a planet s eccentricity relaxes is not given by the gap - collision value , but rather by @xmath35 ( which for our standard model equals 0.07 )  this is the value for which @xmath144 , and marks where supersonically weakened external lindblad resonances balance co - rotation and co - orbital lindblad resonances ( section [ sec : anly ] ) .",
    "this study demonstrates that jupiter - mass planets can have their orbital eccentricities amplified by disk torques  provided they open deep enough gaps , and provided their eccentricities exceed a threshold value .",
    "the finite - amplitude instability documented here appears to be the same as that predicted analytically by @xcite .",
    "eccentricities are damped by first - order co - orbital lindblad torques and first - order co - rotation torques .",
    "deep gaps are required to disable the former , while finite eccentricities serve to saturate ( i.e. , weaken ) the latter @xcite . with these requirements",
    "met , first - order external lindblad resonances can excite a planet s eccentricity .",
    "our results are similar to those of @xcite who also found eccentricity growth for jovian - mass planets at low disk viscosities ( @xmath145 ) , but differ from them insofar as the eccentricity growth that we report explicitly requires a non - zero initial eccentricity .",
    "other studies did not find eccentricity growth for jupiter - mass planets but used larger viscosities or thicker disks .",
    "their results may be reconciled with ours by examining the parameter @xmath146 which governs gap depth .",
    "eccentricity driving seems to require large @xmath147@xmath131 , i.e. , deep gaps of surface density @xmath148 .",
    "eccentricities do not amplify without bound . as eccentricities increase above the disk aspect ratio @xmath119  i.e. , as the planet s epicyclic motion becomes supersonic  the external resonances weaken @xcite . at the same time , the co - orbital resonances strengthen with increasing eccentricity as more disk material leaks into the gap .",
    "consequently , eccentricity damps above a certain value that scales like @xmath119 ; this value is an attractor for the system . in our numerical experiments ,",
    "the attractor eccentricity ranges from 0.07 to 0.09 . at still larger eccentricities",
    " so large that the planet collides into gap walls separated by a fractional width @xmath36  the damping of eccentricity becomes catastrophically rapid .",
    "the results of our numerical study align with analytic expectations only broadly .",
    "significant torques are exerted by material within a hill sphere or so of the planet that linear theory can not capture .",
    "modeling circumplanetary flows is technically challenging and we do not claim to have gotten it right .",
    "in addition to the usual worries about smoothing lengths and planetary accretion prescriptions , there looms the possibility that flows in 3d could look qualitatively different from our 2d solutions @xcite . in particular , gaps may be systematically shallower and co - rotation resonances might never saturate @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity driving reported here does not rely on non - barotropic ( i.e. , non - isothermal or non - adiabatic ) thermodynamics , as our numerical calculations are for strictly isothermal disks . including non - barotropic effects such as those introduced by external irradiation of gap walls may help to lower the threshold eccentricity for instability @xcite .",
    "if eccentricity driving survives in 3d , it offers a possible explanation for the low - to - moderate eccentricities @xmath3 observed for giant planets  including jupiter and conceivably saturn  without recourse to planet - planet interactions ( cf . * ? ? ?",
