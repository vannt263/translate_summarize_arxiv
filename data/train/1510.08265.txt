    "ferromagnetism and singlet superconductivity are two antagonistic long  range orderings .",
    "it was demostrated that , however , they can coexist in superconductor / ferromagnet ( sf ) heterostructures . when and how this coexistence takes place , it has been extensively theoretically described in ref.s . in sf",
    "heterostructures a superconductor is in contact to a ferromagnet , and cooper pairs can penetrate into the f layer , inducing an exponentially decreasing superconducting order parameter in the f region .",
    "the length scale is dictated by the ferromagnetic coeherence length @xmath2 , due to the finite lifetime of the cooper pairs in the exchange field of the ferromagnet .",
    "in addition , the diffusion of the ferromagnetic ordering into the s layer(s ) results in a decrease of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 ( inverse proximity effect ) of the whole structure . moreover , the interaction between the exchange field and the cooper pairs produces an oscillatory behaviour of the superconducting order parameter in the f region with a spatial periodicity , again on the scale of @xmath2 .",
    "the damped oscillatory behaviour of the superconducting order parameter in the ferromagnetic region is responsible for a nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath3 on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer .    in the specific , and much studied@xcite case of sfs trilayers ,",
    "the competition between s and f orderings gives rise to two possible superconducting ground states , so ",
    "called `` @xmath4 '' and `` @xmath5 '' states . in the @xmath4 state",
    "the superconducting order parameter is depressed in the f layer , but no phase difference exists between the s layers . in the @xmath5 state",
    "the superconducting wavefunction shows a @xmath5 phase difference between the s layers , so that the order parameter crosses zero in the f layer .",
    "whether the ground state in a sfs structure is the @xmath4 or @xmath5 , it depends on @xmath2 ( i.e. , on the f material ) and on the ferromagnetic layer thickness @xmath6.@xcite for the very nature of the transition , the main experimental evidence of the @xmath1 transition has been gained through josephson ",
    "like experiments.@xcite it is now widely accepted that , by varying the f thickness or the f material , one can observe the @xmath1 transition .",
    "a second , specific aspect of the @xmath1 transition concerns its true thermodynamic nature . since the signature of the transition",
    "is observed or predicted mostly in phase  interference effects , one might raise some questions about the true nature of the transition .",
    "recently , it has been experimentally observed@xcite that the transition has a true thermodynamic nature : surface impedance measurements yielded the temperature dependence of the superfluid density in sfs samples with different @xmath6 . in the sample with critical @xmath6 thickness ,",
    "a reentrant jump of the superfluid density was observed , in agreement with theoretical calculations.the experimental behavior was in agreement with theoretical calculations,@xcite and the extended theoretical treatment@xcite confirmed the existence of a jump in superfluid density at the @xmath1 , temperature  induced transition.however , while all qualitative features of the theoretical calculations were observed in the measurements of the superfluid density , a few minor quantitative discrepancies existed . as an example",
    ", the temperature  induced transition occurred at a ratio @xmath7 different ( by a factor @xmath82 ) than predicted . at a previous stage , it was not possible to ascertain which aspects of the theory ( such as , e.g. , the perfect transparency of s  f barriers ) were essential to the phenomenon . thus , continuing the study of the sfs heterostructures is relevant to foster the understanding of the fundamental physics that makes the @xmath1 transition observable .",
    "this paper presents a study of the electrodynamics , of the local structure , and of the compositional profile , of sfs , nb / pdni / nb , heterostructures , successive to a 2 years ageing , in order to give information on the @xmath1 transition after possible deterioration of the samples .",
    "the ageing of the samples helps to stress the effect of structural properties , such as the sharpness of the interfaces ordefects in the composition , which may be crucial to quantitatively match the theory and the experimental evidence.the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[samples ] we summarize the preparation of the sfs heterostructures ; in sec.[mw ] we present microwave electrodynamics in aged samples , as compared to fresh samples ; in sec.[xas ] we present the results of extended x  ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) measurements carried out at the nb , pd and ni @xmath9edges , yielding detailed information on the local structure around each species in our samples ; in sec.[tof ] we explore the compositional depth profile of our samples , with 1 nm resolution , obtaining clear information on the interfaces and on possible interdiffusions ; finally , in sec [ disc ] we discuss the results , and give short conclusions .",

    "the sfs trilayers consisted of two nb layers of nominal thickness @xmath18 nm , sputtered at a rate of @xmath19 nm / s , and an intermediate pd@xmath10ni@xmath11 one of different thickness @xmath20 210 nm , deposited at a rate of @xmath21 nm / s .",

    "measurements of the quality factor @xmath32 and of the resonant frequency @xmath31 yielded the variation of the effective surface resistance @xmath34 and of the effective penetration depth @xmath35 with @xmath36 , according to : @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a reference temperature and @xmath40 is a geometrical factor that can be computed by standard simulation software .",

    "( b ) sample d8 , same symbols as in ( a ) ; the arrow marks the appearance of he signature of the @xmath1 transition after ageing ; note also the upward shift of @xmath3 after ageing . ]    in a previous work@xcite we have measured @xmath29 in samples d2 , d8 , d9 , and in the nb sample as a reference .",
    "the presence of a sharp _ increase _ of @xmath35 ( that is , a _ decrease _ in @xmath45 ) with decreasing temperature , at @xmath46 , was the evidence for the temperature  induced @xmath1 transition , from the high@xmath36 , @xmath4 state , to the low@xmath36 , @xmath5 state .",
    "notably , it was possible to observe the @xmath36induced transition only in the sample with the specific f thickness @xmath20 2 nm .",
    "interestingly , above this thickness a departure from conventional behaviour was observed in the mixed  state properties , such as the flux ",
    "flow resistivity,@xcite the vortex pinning constant,@xcite and the flux  creep factor.@xcite some of these observations were related to a change in the superconducting state .",
    "thus , there is evidence that the @xmath1 transition marks a boundary between different superconducting states , with the @xmath5 state firmly established in samples with large enough @xmath6 ( that is , with the superconducting transition directly into the @xmath5 state ) , and a double transition ( in the superconducting @xmath4 state at @xmath3 , and then in the @xmath5 state at @xmath46 ) in the sample with critical f thickness .    in order to show the experimental signature of the @xmath36induced @xmath1 transition , data for @xmath29 and for @xmath47 , as well as the corresponding raw data for @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are reported in fig.s [ figexp]b and [ figexp]c .",
    "the data refer to `` fresh '' samples , measured within a few weeks after preparation .",
    "we emphasize that the flattening of the data above @xmath3 is due to the sensitivity limit of the resonator : the flat value should not be taken as the `` normal state '' value . since we have identified the nonmonotonous behavior of @xmath29 as the signature of the @xmath1 transition , it is important to rule out possible spurious effects that can mimic this behavior",
    ". an extensive discussion has been reported previously,@xcite we shortly recall it here .",
    "first , several experimental runs were performed , including runs after entirely disassembling and reassembling the microwave resonator : the data completely overlapped .",
    "second , the same jump in @xmath29 obtained by direct measurements in zero magnetic field ( as those here reported ) , was obtained by estimating the effective penetration depth from the condensation energy derived from magnetic  field  dependent microwave measurements ( a completely different experiment ) : the results from the different experiments were in excellent agreement . moreover ,",
    "multiple transitions are ruled out by the fact that they would lead to a stepwise temperature dependence of @xmath29 , and not to a reentrance ( note that the data for @xmath47 point to the same conclusion ) .",
    "a more subtle spurious effect may reside in the stray field of the magnetic layer itself and/or of magnetic small particles embedded in the superconducting matrix .",
    "such phenomena have been widely studied,@xcite with the largest influence on the magnetoresistance and the magnetization in external magnetic fields .",
    "we focus here on the few effects that can be observable in our zero  field measurements . in superconducting films with different local concentration of ferromagnetic nanoparticles",
    ", a multi  state resistance value could be observed.@xcite the effect was enhanced by an external magnetic field ( which is not our case ) , and most importantly it would similarly give , in our sample  averaged measurements , a multi  step transition both in @xmath47 as well as in @xmath29 . the effect would be similar to the transition of a multiphase superconductor , while the observed behavior is a reentrance of the superconducting properties .",
    "a second possible effect comes from the stray field due to the coupling of the external ferromagnetic layers in fsf heterostructures:@xcite the stray field could locally exceed the critical field . in our sfs heterostructures , that contain a single f layer ,",
    "this phenomenon is likely to be much weaker .",
    "moreover , the effect on our sample  averaged measurements would again be similar to a multiphase superconductor , thus giving rise to a multi  step or a broadened transition .",
    "thus , we believe that spurious effects are unlikely to produce a reentrance in the superconducting propeorties , in our experimental configuration and with the check we have made . as it will be largely discussed in the following , we anticipate that repetition of the measurements on the same samples after 24 months yielded strongly different results ( while short  term repetition of the measurements gave identical results , as discussed in ref . ) .",
    "since aim of this paper is to understand this ageing effect and gather informations from joint electrodynamics , structural and chemical investigation , we performed a preliminary repetition of the measurements on the reference nb sample , as  grown and after ageing .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fignb ] , in terms of @xmath29 , fig.[fignb]a , and @xmath47 , fig.[fignb]b . as it can be seen , after a rather long time of 24 months the measurements are practically identical .",
    "thus , we conclude that any ageing effect that should be observed must not be ascribed to any deterioration of the nb itself , but only to alterations of the pdni layer or of the f / s interfaces    fig .",
    "[ figmwaged ] reports the main experimental findings of this section .",
    "there , we report and compare @xmath29 and @xmath48 obtained for the fresh and aged trilayers d2 and d8 .",
    "several effects emerge .",
    "first , @xmath3 of the sample d2 is little changed ( a small shift upward , @xmath49  50  mk , might be inferred ) , while in sample d8 @xmath3 clearly shifts _ upward _ with ageing : this result is in clear contradiction with any nave interpretation of the ageing effects in terms of just a deterioration of the samples .",
    "the involved phenomena are clearly more complex .",
    "the second important effect is the shift at higher @xmath36 of the @xmath1 transition in sample d2 , where it is accompanied by a broadening and weakening , as indicated by the very faint remaining features , and the emergence of the fingerprint of the transition in sample d8 , although in a broader fashion than in the fresh sample d2 .",
    "it is then clear that the ageing produce changes in the pdni layer , that affect the magnetic properties and then the overall superconducting order parameter , in a nontrivial fashion .",
    "thus , before any discussion of the electrodynamics data a structural and compositional analysis is in order .",
    "the following sections are devoted to this task .",
    "x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) is a chemical selective probe@xcite that we used to investigate the local structure around nb , ni and pd atoms in the aged samples and to individuate the modifications of the local structure and of the composition with respect to the nominal parameters . to this aim",

    "the quantitative analysis ( best fit parameters ) shows that the nb ",
    "nb interatomic distances are unchanged in the trilayers .",
    "the structural disorder ( @xmath62 parameters ) in the trilayers is higher than in pure nb film , but it is similar in all aged trilayers ( within the uncertainty ) , suggesting that the disorder induced in the nb layers is weakly dependent on the pdni film thickness .",
    "further understanding about the mechanisms giving rise to the structural disorder and to the modification of the superconducting response of the heterostructures can be obtained looking at the local atomic structure around pd and ni atoms .",

    "the @xmath66weighted pd and ni @xmath9edge experimental exafs spectra @xmath67 , along with the best fit curves , are shown in fig.s [ figniexafs ] and [ figpdexafs ] for all the four trilayers , and the resulting parameters for the best fits are reported in the tables accompanying fig.s [ figniexafs ] and [ figpdexafs ] .",
    "pd xafs spectra present higher statistical noise for thinner samples , in particular d2 and d4 samples had to be analysied in a restricted @xmath66range .",
    "the amplitude of the exafs signal steadily increases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this is especially evident on the ni @xmath9edge data .",
    "it is then a qualitative observation that in aged samples the disorder around pd and ni is larger in thinner pdni layers .",
    "this is a suggestion that the degradation affects mainly the regions close to the interface since should it be a homogeneous volume effect no trend would be observed with increasing the pdni thickness .",

    "thus , while absolute values for @xmath57 may well be affected by systematic inaccuracy , we are confident about the relative trend resulting from the exafs analysis as a function of @xmath6",
    ". in particular , our findings suggests that structural and compositional disorder occurs within the f layers giving rise to a deviation of the local atomic structure from the ideal one .",
    "the origin of these effects resides in the f / s interfaces , as they are larger for thinner samples .",
    "the results of ni and pd exafs data analysis consistently suggest that the pd@xmath68ni@xmath23 phase is systematically richer in ni with respect to the x=0.84 nominal composition .",
    "a relatively large fraction of pd occurs in a nb  rich phase , suggesting pd atoms migrate into the s layers .",
    "this finding is consistent with our previous tem analysis,@xcite which showed the presence of heavy ions ( arguably , pd ) within nb , and in particular in the bottom nb layer .",
    "a fraction of ni atoms goes in a ni  rich phase , suggesting that migration of pd into nb not only would leave ni  richer pd@xmath68ni@xmath23 , but can also give rise to almost pure ni regions in the sample .",
    "from the exafs study it emerges that substantial modifications occurred in the pdni , f layers of aged samples , with possible effects on the nb , s layers .",
    "we stress that the magnetic properties of the pdni alloy change with the composition,@xcite so that any information on the actual composition of the magnetic layer is very relevant to the understanding of the electrodynamics data    in order to clarify further the changes , we performed a detailed analysis of the compositional profile in trilayers , using the tof ",

    "the sputtering time was converted to depth using a measurement of the overall thickness with a profilometer , the appearance of nb@xmath70 as zero depth and the sharp increase of al@xmath70 as a measure of the substrate level . in connection to the detection of al@xmath70 , we note that , since we were also interested in evaluating the thickness of each layer , we use very little or no presputtering . thus , close to the surface we detect all the surface contaminants , and al among them : clearly , this is not due to the substrate .    before the presentation of the results , we remind that tof ",
    "sims data relative to different species can not be quantitatively compared : different intensities of the signal in different species are not necessarily a measure of the relative abundance .",
    "moreover , primary ions , during their impact on the target surface , give rise to implantation phenomena which produce a persistency of the detection of a species even beyond its existence in the material .",
    "thus , one should give particular care to the increase and decrease of the traces .",
    "we first assess the uniformity of the composition of the layers in different locations of the surface .",
    "we found very consistent results in all samples .",
    "as an illustration , in fig .",

    "it is seen that all traces show the same dependence on the depth : this is a demonstration that the trilayer is homogeneous over planes parallel to the surface .",
    "moreover , it should be especially noted that ni@xmath70 and @xmath72pd@xmath70 traces track the same behaviour .    from observation of fig.[fig : unifo ] , we note that the effective thickness of the layers is consistently smaller than the nominal value .",
    "let us focus momentarily on the nb@xmath70 traces : using the kink of the decrease as a marker for the boundary of the first ( outmost ) nb layer with pdni , we estimate @xmath73 11 nm for the first layer . using the increase of the same trace at a depth @xmath74 16 nm as the marker for the second interface",
    ", we have again @xmath73 11 nm for the second ( inner ) layer , to be compared with nominal value of 15 nm .",
    "we will see in the next figures that , as it is very reasonable , this is due to oxydized nbo layers ( with o coming from the air for the outer layer , and from the substrate for the inner layer ) .",
    "we note that also the pdni layer is thinner than the nominal value . using the same criteria to evaluate the thickness",
    ", we estimate @xmath75 6 nm , as compared to the nominal value of 8 nm . the smooth , slow decrease of the traces above the depth of 16 nm , together with the exafs data ,",
    "indicate that the smaller thickness of the f layer is likely to be due to diffusion processes at the lower interface pdni / nb .",
    "the general features here uncovered are found in all samples . in order to discuss more thoroughly the composition of the aged structures",
    ", we now report for each sample the full set of traces ( taken in a single location to avoid crowding ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tofsims ] reports in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) the traces for al@xmath70 , ni@xmath70 , nb@xmath70 , nbo@xmath70 and @xmath72pd@xmath70 as a function of the depth in samples d2 , d4 and d8 , respectively . the ni@xmath70 and @xmath72pd@xmath70 signals are close to the sensitivity level , but nevertheless they show the existence of the intermediate pdni layer .",
    "the comparison with the nb@xmath70 trace allows to evaluate the pdni thickness as @xmath76 2 , 3.5 , 6 nm in samples d2 , d4 , d8 , respectively .    ,",
    "ni@xmath70 , nb@xmath70 , nbo@xmath70 and @xmath72pd@xmath70 signals as a function of the depth in samples d2 , d4 , d8 ( from top to bottom ) . in all cases",
    "it is seen that the nb layers have an actual thickness of @xmath8 10 nm . ]    the nb@xmath70 signals decrease , but remain appreciable in the region corresponding to the pdni layer .",
    "this is likely to be due to the collision processes , responsible for the re  implantation of ions in the sample .",
    "however , we can not exclude that part of the signal comes from a blurred interface between nb and pdni .",
    "we note that the `` tails '' of the ni@xmath70 and @xmath72pd@xmath70 signals are particularly long in sample d4 . taking into account that the measurements for pd and ni are very close to the sensitivity limit",
    ", we believe that this result is consistent with exafs data indicating diffusion of pd into the nb ( inner ) layer .",
    "nbo is the only significant contaminant in our samples : it is mainly present in a region which extends for @xmath77 5 nm in depth , both at the air / nb and nb / sapphire interfaces , whence the obvious origin of oxygen .",
    "however , we note that there is a second , smaller peak of the nbo@xmath70 trace at the pdni / nb ( inner layer ) interface , most likely originating in the deposition process .    summarizing , from tof ",
    "sims measurements in aged heterostructures we have obtained that ( i ) the trilayers are very homogeneous over planes parallel to the surface , ( ii ) the actual nb ( s ) thickness is @xmath78 ( 11 @xmath79 1 ) nm , ( iii ) the actual pdni ( f ) thickness is close , but slightly reduced with respect to nominal values , ( iv ) the interfaces , and in particular the f / s ( inner layer ) interface , is somewhat blurred over 1 - 2 nm . in the next and last section we discuss all the information gathered from all the measurements up to now presented .",
    "the whole body of data collected allows for several remarks on the effect of ageing .",
    "the following discussion takes into account the effects observed on the superconducting and the @xmath1 transition after ageing , that is the shift to _ higher _ temperature of @xmath3 in samples d2 and d8 , the shift of @xmath80 at higher @xmath36 and the broadening of the transition in sample d2 , and the appearance of the signature of the @xmath1 transition in sample d8 .",
    "we first argue that the effects of the nb oxidisation do not play any role .",
    "in fact , the electrodynamics measurements in nb do not show any effect at all with ageing .",
    "we note that even a simple reduction of the thickness of the superconducting layer should bring detectable changes : since the effective surface resistance in thin samples is@xcite @xmath81 , a reduction of the thickness @xmath22 would immediately bring a scale factor in the measured @xmath82 , which is not seen in the data of fig .",
    "[ fignb ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the presence of nbo stems from oxidisation during deposition , for the interface nb / sapphire , and upon exposition to the atmosphere , for the outermost layer , and that it is not the result of ageing . as a consequence ,",
    "the actual nb thicknesses of our samples have to be taken as @xmath73 20 nm in the pure nb film , and @xmath78 10 nm in the trilayers .",
    "the changes in the pdni layer are more relevant to the @xmath1 transition .",
    "let us focus first on sample d2 .",
    "according to the previous findings,@xcite the heterostructure entered the superconducting state at @xmath3 in the @xmath4 state , and only at lower @xmath80 the @xmath1 transition occurred , to a _",
    "weaker _ superconducting state ( that is , with a smaller superfluid density ) . by changing the effect of the f layer ( increased disorder , less clean due to mixing with the s material ) ,",
    "the @xmath1 transition is broadened .",
    "the tof  sims data taken in different locations of the sample stand against an explanation of the broadening in terms of local inhomogeneity .",
    "instead , there is a clear inhomogeneity along the depth of the structure .",
    "thus , the weakening and broadening of the @xmath1 transition should be ascribed first to the blurring of the interfaces ( most notably , the f / s interface with the inner s layer ) .",
    "exafs also points to a change in the alloy . with a larger amount of ni",
    ", a shorter @xmath2 is expected .",
    "this effect can counterbalance the deterioration of the sharpness of the interfaces and the increase of disorder , leaving a faint trace of the @xmath1 transition .",
    "we note that theoretical calculations in sfs heterostructures with a modulation of the interface predict a weakening of the sharpness of the @xmath1 transition , in terms of a change of the transition from first to second order.@xcite    in sample d8 the increased disorder has a smaller effect , due to the larger f thickness . in this case , we believe that the strongest alteration is the change of the effective f thickness , from 8 nm to less than 6 nm . this effect can not be easily mapped onto a clean system , but the appearance of the @xmath1 fingerprint indicates that the sample has sufficiently decreased its effective f thickness to enter the region where the superconducting state at @xmath3 is the @xmath4 state .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 increased significantly ( by approximately 0.3 k , with @xmath83 3.8 k in the fresh sample ) also points to a smaller effect of the f layer .    in summary",
    ", the reentrance of the superconducting order parameter , fingerprint of the transition 0-@xmath5 , was investigated by means of microwave measurements in `` fresh '' and `` aged '' sfs trilayers as a function of the f layer thickness .",
    "the structural and compositional properties of the aged samples have been studied by means of exafs and tof  sims analysis . increased local disorder , and formation of nbpd and ninb alloys ,",
    "were found in aged samples .",
    "sims indicated that the interfaces were most affected . despite severe effects in the ordering of the species in the f layers and in the quality of the sf interfaces , the temperature  induced @xmath1 transition is still detected .",
    "thus , the assumption of ideal interfaces does not seem to be an essential aspect of the theoretical description , and other physical properties play a stronger role : e.g. , the exchange field and/or the ferromagnetic coherence length.@xcitemoreover , our data suggest that an `` effective '' f thickness can include non negligible disorder and nonideal interfaces , at least as the most relevant correction .",
    "lt thanks `` fondazione roma '' for financial support to the surface analysis laboratory at roma tre .",
    "the analysis of pd and ni @xmath9edge spectra required some care because the data statistics is generally lower compared with nb data , partially because of the smaller amount of absorbers that reduces the fluorescence signal . moreover , higher structural disorder is expected due to the confinement in a thinner layer and to interface effects .",
    "in addition , the pd and ni atoms are randomly distributed on the fcc lattice : this raises the number of contributions to be considered , as each shell must include scattering from both ni and pd atoms .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggested a local structure around pd and ni different from pure pd@xmath84ni@xmath85 alloy , and pointed to some interdiffusion effect ( nb  rich pdnb phase ) and ion segregation ( ni  rich phase ) that must be considered carefully to achieve a reliable quantitative interpretation of the structural and compositional results . due to the number of contributions to be considered in the analysis it is required to impose physical constraints on the fitting parameters , in order to reduce the correlation effects and to avoid unphysical results .",
    "we apply the following model : + * i*. we restrict the analysis to the first two coordination shells of the pdni phase ( up to about 3.9  ) , each shell including both ni and pd neighbours ; + * ii*. the total coordination numbers of each shell were constrained to the fcc structure ( n@xmath86=12 , n@xmath87=6 ) .",
    "a free parameter @xmath57 is defined , providing the number of pd ( @xmath88 ) and ni ( @xmath89 ) neighbours for the @xmath90th shell ; + * iii*. @xmath91 , @xmath92 were further multiplied by a factor @xmath93 , @xmath60 being a free parameter in the fitting representing the fraction of absorber in a phase different from pd@xmath24ni@xmath23 ( see below ) ; + * iv*. we assume that the lattice parameter @xmath94 of the pd@xmath24ni@xmath23 alloys has a linear behaviour as a function of the composition @xmath57 for @xmath95 .",
    "the parameters are fixed by linear regression trough @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 values .",
    "notice that @xmath96 is not a free parameter but constrained to @xmath57 ; + * v*. for each shell the disorder factors , @xmath97 , were kept equal for pd and ni neighbour .",
    "preliminary tests suggest that additional contributions must be considered in the analysis of pd and ni xafs , other than pd@xmath24ni@xmath23 phase . in this respect ,",
    "pd and ni data behave differently : for pd @xmath9edge data , an additional contribution is consistent with a nb rich phase .",
    "we assume this phase having bcc structure accordingly to literature data for nb ",
    "rich nb@xmath68pd@xmath23 phases.@xcite we included the first two bcc coordination shells in the analysis , the coordination numbers were weighted by the free parameter @xmath60 , giving the fraction of pd into the nb  rich phase .",
    "for the ni @xmath9edge data an additional contribution is consistent with ni ",
    "ni coordination shell around 2.5  , consistent with fcc ni phase ( @xmath59=3.52 ) .",
    "the fraction of ni in the ni  rich phase is refined using a free parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the disorder factor @xmath98 was kept fixed to avoid the strong correlation with the parameter @xmath60 .",
