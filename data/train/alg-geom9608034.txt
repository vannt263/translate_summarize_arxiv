    "let us start by stating the result and a few consequences .",
    "let @xmath0 be an algebraic variety which is complete over a field @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 be any effective cartier divisor on @xmath3 we denote by @xmath4 the line bundle associated to @xmath5 with @xmath6 it is a very interesting problem to know if the ring @xmath7 is a finitely generated @xmath1-algebra .",
    "it was o. zariski who worked out the case of algebraic surfaces in order to solve the riemann - roch problem , and gave examples where @xmath8 is not finitely generated , see @xcite . in this article",
    "we prove that the ring @xmath8 is finitely generated when @xmath0 is a complete toric variety ( perhaps singular ) .",
    "the ring @xmath8 appears in many interesting problems , for example , if @xmath0 is a nonsingular projective variety , then the finite generation of @xmath8 implies that the series @xmath9 is rational .",
    "it was asked by s. d. cutkosky and v. srinivas @xcite if this series is rational when @xmath2 is a nef divisor .",
    "our result gives trivially a positive answer in the case of a complete toric variety , and @xmath2 any effective cartier divisor .",
    "furthermore , the rationality of the series also allows us to compute , at least theoretically , the dimension of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath11 .",
    "this is the riemann - roch problem , see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "observe that these dimensions are not given by the riemann - roch theorem since the variety @xmath0 can be singular , and the line bundle @xmath4 is not necessarily generated by its global sections .",
    "we would like to make a final remark .",
    "the ring @xmath8 is a subring of the ring @xmath12 , which is finitely generated in the case of toric varieties .",
    "in fact , d. cox proves in @xcite that the ring @xmath13 is a polynomial ring graded by the the monoid of effective divisors classes in the chow group @xmath14 of @xmath0 , where @xmath15 is the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we prove that the ring @xmath8 , which was defined by equation ( [ ring ] ) , is a finitely generated @xmath1-algebra . throughout this section @xmath0",
    "means a complete toric variety over a field @xmath16 and @xmath2 a cartier divisor in @xmath3 the construction of the cone @xmath17 , in the proof of the theorem , is a well know construction , see for example  @xcite .",
    "we start by recalling an important lemma that will be use in the proof of the theorem .",
    "we first observe that we can consider our divisor @xmath2 to be @xmath22-invariant . for the following sequence",
    "is exact , see  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the group of @xmath22-invariant cartier divisors and @xmath25 is the dual lattice of @xmath26",
    ". then we can write @xmath2 as @xmath27 with @xmath28 the set of invariant divisors .",
    "we consider the convex rational polyhedron @xmath29 in @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the the first element in the lattice appearing in the divisor @xmath33 .",
    "we know that generators for the space @xmath34 are given by the elements of @xmath35 , which is a finite set because @xmath0 is a complete variety , this also implies that @xmath36 is a rational convex polytope .",
    "let us embed the k - dimensional @xmath37-vector space @xmath38 into the ( k+1)-dimensional @xmath37-vector space @xmath39 as the hyperplane with equation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are coordinates for @xmath42 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the ( @xmath43)-dimensional cone in @xmath42 generated by the rays starting at the origin and passing through the vertices of @xmath36 ( see figure below ) .",
    "it follows from the definition that @xmath44 , and this implies that the intersection of the hyperplane @xmath45 with the cone @xmath17 is just the polyhedron @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , the cone @xmath17 is the cone associated to the ring @xmath8 , in the sense that any element of the ring @xmath8 is a finite linear combination of integral points of @xmath46 the theorem follows since the semigroup @xmath47 is finitely generated by lemma  [ gordan ] ( gordan ) .",
    "i thank very much v. srinivas for suggesting me this problem and for many wonderful and fruitful conversations .",
    "i also would like to thank a. king for bringing to my attention the article of d. cox , and to the referee for pointing out the article of v. batyrev ."
