    "the dna double helix is the molecule that encodes the genetic information in living cells .",
    "in addition to carrying the genome , dna has also specific physical properties that are essential for its biological functions .",
    "its mechanical properties are exploited by the protein machinery for the transcription , replication , repair and packaging of dna @xcite . during the last decade it has been possible to manipulate single dna molecules to determine its elastic properties under different physical conditions @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the extension of single molecule versus an applied stretching force is measured by a variety of technics including magnetic beads @xcite , optical traps @xcite , micro - needles @xcite , hydrodynamic flow @xcite and afm @xcite .",
    "the studies also made it possible to better understand mechanical interactions between dna and proteins @xcite .",
    "the most appealing theoretical description of the dna molecule is the wormlike chain ( wlc ) model which is a coarse - grained model of dna with a single parameter , the persistence length @xmath0 , characterizing the chain stiffness .",
    "originating back to the first half of the last century  @xcite it gained renewed interest after the semiflexible nature of dna and other ( bio)polymers became clear @xcite and it is now indispensable for the theoretical understanding of many single molecule experiments .",
    "in many cases stiff polymers show a characteristic force - extension behavior that can be well understood in terms of the wlc as being the result of entropic fluctuations of the chain that  with increasing tension ",
    "become suppressed at shorter and shorter wave lengths .",
    "measuring the force - extension characteristics of such a chain allows to extracts its overall contour length as well as its persistence length .",
    "the dna in living cells is rarely found in its straight  naked  state ; rather an overwhelming fraction of dna is strongly configurationally constrained by binding proteins causing loops , bends and wraps .",
    "in particular , protein complexes forming loops are essential for biological process like distant gene expression or dna packaging @xcite .",
    "the formation of loops in a dna molecule under tension has been the subject of the theoretical investigation in ref .",
    "@xcite . also , single molecule stretching experiments on dna condensed with multivalent counterions performed by several groups @xcite might bear loops or related structures like dna toroids @xcite . while the statistical mechanics of unconstrained dna under tension is well described by the wlc @xcite , the presence of topological constraints like supercoiling @xcite and entanglements @xcite , or geometrical constraints like protein induced kinks and bends @xcite renders analytical results more difficult .    in this paper ,",
    "we expand the repertoire of analytically solvable  equations of state  by deriving the force extension relation for a dna with a sliding loop as depicted in fig .",
    "[ loopcompilation ] .",
    "the computation is performed by evaluating quadratic fluctuations around the looped solution  a non - constant saddle - point of the dna elastic energy .",
    "the method is essentially analogous to the semiclassical treatment of tunneling amplitudes in quantum mechanics and instantons in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the equation of state of looped dna that we present here can be considered as a paradigmatic model case for stretching dna with a non - trivial ground state .",
    "having understood the physics of the looped dna it is straightforward to extend the analysis also to other cases where the overall dna conformation is far from being straight .",
    "the calculation presented in the present work has been sketched in a previous paper @xcite ( for the high - force limit ) together with some interesting experimental situations , namely rigid protein - induced kinks and anchoring deflections in afm stretching of semiflexible polymers .",
    "expressions relating the force - extension measurements to the underlying kink / boundary deflection geometry were also provided in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to the case of the galr - loop complex @xcite .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper to analyze concrete experimental setups , but to give a more detailed and comprehensive description of our computation .",
    "this paper is also more general as we employ our method also to determine the equation of state of sliding loop in the small force regime where the semi - classical approximation is valid for dna with length smaller than the persistence length whereas for longer dna our computation is only valid for large forces . in that strong force regime",
    ", it will be shown that the presence of the loop modifies the the elastic response of the chain in such a manner that the persistence length appears effectively reduced according to the relation @xmath1 for a single loop this is obviously a finite size effect involving the scaled total length @xmath2 , but the effect remains significant over a large range of parameters ( e.g. @xmath3 for @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore the interpretation of corresponding stretching data has to be taken with care : even though the data seem to suggest wlc behavior , the extracted value of persistence length might not reflect the real chain stiffness .",
    "an intriguing example that actually inspired this work is the force - extension characteristics of dna in the presence of condensing agents like spermidine or cohex @xcite .",
    "it shows in some cases a stick - release pattern which might be attributed to the sequential unpeeling of single turns of a toroidal condensate @xcite .",
    "what is important here is that in between the force peaks one can nicely fit wlc behavior but the persistence length that one extracts from these data is typically much lower than that of dna . only when the last turn is disrupted and the dna is in a straight configuration one finds the expected value of the chain stiffness .        before going into any kind of theoretical analysis of looped dna under tension it is important to note that such a configuration is intrinsically _",
    "not _ stable and has therefore to be stabilized by some mechanism .",

    "[ intro1 ] .",
    "the basic assumption of a purely elastic description of dna ( and other semiflexible polymers as well ) is that the local energy density of a given dna state is given as a quadratic function of the underlying distortions from the straight state .",
    "let us consider the simplest situation where the dna twist degree of freedom can be neglected .",
    "this can be done in cases when the dna twist is not constrained from outside , i.e. , when no external torsional torques are acting on it .",
    "then we can describe the path of the dna of given length @xmath7 and bending constant @xmath8 subjected to an applied tension @xmath9 by the space curve @xmath10  with the tangent @xmath11 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the parameter @xmath12 as the contour length and to normalize the tangent to unity @xmath13 .",
    "the elastic energy under an applied force @xmath14 writes in this case  @xcite @xmath15 = \\int\\nolimits_{0}^{l}\\left ( \\frac{a}{2}\\left ( \\frac{d% \\mathbf{t}}{ds}\\right ) ^{2}-\\mathbf{f\\cdot t}\\right ) ds   \\label{eeelastic}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the bending stiffness that is usually expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath5 is the orientational persistence length ; for dna @xmath17 nm @xcite .",

    "[ ebendeulers ] by adding the term @xmath26 with @xmath27 denoting the twist - rigidity constant that is for dna of the same magnitude as the bending constant , @xmath28 nm @xcite .",
    "the reason why we can neglect it in some ( but by far not all ) problems is that if the twist angle @xmath29 is not explicitly constrained ( no rotational torque or torsional constraining of dna ) @xmath29 can always adapt so that the @xmath27 multiplying term in the integral vanishes ( without affecting @xmath24 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "remarkably , as pointed out by kirchhoff  @xcite the _ total energy _ of deformed dna ( elastic rod ) can be mapped onto the _ lagrangian action _ of a symmetric spinning top in a gravity field .",
    "the angles then @xmath31 and @xmath32 describing the local deformations of the rod along the _ contour length _ @xmath33 become the euler - angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the spinning top describing the rotation of the internal coordinates system ( with respect to the space fixed frame ) as functions of _ time _ @xmath36 .",
    "all the quantities appearing in eq .",
    "[ ebendeulers ] have their counterparts in the spinning top case  @xcite . the tension @xmath14 is the equivalent of the gravity force acting on the spinning top ; the rigidity constants @xmath27 and @xmath8 correspond to the principal moments of inertia around the symmetry axis and perpendicular to it , respectively .",
    "the resulting rod shapes are usually called _ euler - kirchhoff filaments _ ( in 3d ) or _ euler - elastica _ ( in the 2d case ) .",
    "they are given explicitly in terms of elliptic functions and integrals  @xcite .",
    "the latter fact allows one in many cases ( for a given set of forces and boundary conditions ) to obtain the dna shapes in an analytical or at least numerically inexpensive manner .      the previous description of dna conformations via the ground state of a purely elastic beam can , however , only be successful for very short dna ( shorter than its persistence length @xmath5 ) . in many practical situations with the dna molecules having lengths on the order of microns to centimeters ( @xmath37 )",
    "one needs to go beyond the ground state description .",
    "but as shown in this paper , this is even true for short dna ( @xmath38 ) forming a loop . an important question ( from the experimental and theoretical point of view ) in the context of dna stretching is the determination of the mean end - to - end distance of a dna chain as a function of the stretching force @xmath14 at a finite temperature @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "then in order to take into account temperature effects on a wlc under tension one has to compute the following partition function @xmath40 e^{-\\beta e\\left [ \\mathbf{\\underline{t}}\\right ] }   \\label{pathintegral1}\\ ] ] with the energy expression given by eq .",
