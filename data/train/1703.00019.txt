    "one of the major efforts in current research is to determine a more accurate age for the milky way as an independent test of modern theories of cosmology .",
    "metal - poor globular clusters ( gcs ) are important in this effort as they are among the oldest objects in the galaxy .",
    "a comparison of gc color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to theoretical isochrones can be used to determine gc distances and ages .",
    "stellar evolution models were first developed for solar - metallicity stars but are now pushing towards calibration at lower metallicities .",
    "the calibration of these models requires one to define the location of the main - sequence ( ms ) as a function of metallicity via ms - fitting ; however , to date there is only one star , hd25329 , with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 -1.4 dex and with an _ hipparcos _ parallax @xcite and chemical abundance determination from high resolution spectroscopy @xcite accurate enough for use in ms - fitting .",
    "this lack of calibration stars introduces a great amount of uncertainty in the distance and age determinations for metal - poor gcs which we we aim to improve with our study .",
    "one of the key features for an accurate ms - fitting calibration is accurate distances and abundances for very low metallicity ms stars .",
    "accurate parallaxes for metal - poor stars are now available in the first _ gaia _",
    "data release , which use the tycho - gaia astrometric solution ( tgas ) @xcite to obtain parallaxes with typical uncertainties of 0.25 mas ; however , even more accurate stellar parallaxes have been measured with the hubble space telescope s ( hst ) fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) for nine very metal - poor dwarf stars ( @xmath7 ) and are presented in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to obtain accurate overall metallicities of the same very metal - poor ms stars with hst parallaxes to be used in ms - fitting .",
    "we were motivated to use the robust technique of a line - by - line , differential abundance analysis , ultimately relative to the sun , as it should provide abundances that are independent of loggf values .",
    "the iterative nature of this method was expected to provide excitation temperatures independent of line equivalent widths ( ews ) and ionization balance for ionized and neutral species of the same elements . however , in the process we uncovered issues ( e.g. non - ionization equilibrium and low spectroscopic gravities ) that a 1d lte analysis is incapable of resolving .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath82",
    "we present our target selection criteria and spectroscopic observations , in @xmath83 we present the abundance analysis based on the ews of fe and @xmath2-element spectral lines and stellar model atmospheres .",
    "the differential abundance results are provided in @xmath84 along with an error analysis and a comparison to the dartmouth stellar evolution program isochrones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dsep ) .",
    "finally , the significance of our findings is discussed in @xmath85 .",
    "the release of the _ hipparcos _ catalog @xcite led to a renewed interest in using ms - fitting to determine distances to gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these studies generally found that the gcs were somewhat more distant , and hence younger than found in previous work .",
    "the location of the ms in a color - magnitude diagram is a sensitive function of the composition of the stars , and these main sequence fitting studies were hampered by the lack of very metal - poor stars ( @xmath9}\\la-1.4$]dex ) which had accurate _",
    "_ parallaxes .",
    "the original _ hipparocs _ parallaxes were reanalyzed by @xcite leading to smaller uncertainties in the parallaxes . unfortunately , even with this improved data , only one very metal - poor star ( hd25329 ) was found to have a parallax measured to better than 10% accuracy , suitable for ms - fitting . having only one comparison star at low metallicity results in large uncertainties in distance determinations and therefore ages of metal - poor gcs .",
    "to alleviate this situation , we were awarded time on hst to obtain fgs parallaxes of nine very metal - poor stars with the goal of extending the range of metallicities below at least [ fe / h ] @xmath10dex for stars with well - determined parallaxes .    to select stars for the hst program , single , un - evolved ( i.e. main sequence ) stars that were very metal - poor",
    "were selected from the lists complied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . based upon the increased number of stars with reliable parallaxes , and the fact that the hst parallaxes would have substantially smaller uncertainties than the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes",
    ", we anticipated that the hst parallaxes would result in an improvement in the distance scale to metal - poor gcs by a factor of three compared to previous work .",
    "long term radial velocity monitoring from @xcite was used to ensure the target stars are not members of multiple star systems . to ensure that the stars are on the main - sequence",
    ", we required that the target stars be faint ( @xmath11 ) and/or have a large surface gravity ( @xmath12 dex  cm  s@xmath13 ( henceforth , dex ) ) and also be fairly red in color ( @xmath14 ) , all characteristics of ms stars .",
    "these specific cut - offs in absolute magnitude , surface gravity and color were based upon an examination of the properties of metal - poor ms stars in the dsep theoretical isochrones . since the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes have relatively large uncertainties for these stars , surface gravity and color constraints helped to eliminate evolved stars ( sub - giants and giant branch stars ) from the sample .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of the nine target stars were obtained between 2008 and 2012 using the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) double spectrograph on the 6.5 meter magellan ii clay telescope , at las campanas observatory , and the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on the twin telescopes at the keck observatory .",
    "our mike spectra roughly cover the range of 33755000  on the blue side and 48509160  on the red side ; however , small changes in the choice of grating tilt between runs can lead to the inclusion or exclusion of an order .",
    "the mike blue - channel spectra actually extend beyond 5000  , but beyond 5000  the spectra are not useful for abundance analysis , due to the presence of spectral ghosts ; these ghosts result from internal reflections within the dichroic optical element .",
    "no spectral ghosts are detectable in the red - channel spectra .",
    "for all mike observations we employed a 0.5@xmath155.0 arc second slit , with 2@xmath151 binning , resulting in a measured spectral resolving power of @xmath16=48,000 for the red side and @xmath16=55,000 for the blue side .    the hires spectra consist of data from three ccds in the plane of this single spectrograph ; for our setup chips  1 through 3",
    "cover the spectral range 41155600  , 56507175  , and 72358695 respectively .",
    "our hires observations employed a slit width of 0.574 arc seconds and 2@xmath151 binning of the ccd pixels , which resulted in a measured average resolving power of r=70,500 ; however , significant degradation of the resolving power was seen from the center to the edges of the spectral orders .",
    "we note that the resolving power we have measured , for both spectrographs , is higher than cited in the manuals ; this was likely a consequence of the good seeing at the time of observation .",
    "we measured the per pixel s / n from the rms scatter of the blaze peak near 67306750 using the iraf _ splot _ routine ; typically , our s / n values greatly exceed 100:1 , permitting reliable measurement of ews down to the 5m  level .",
    "radial velocities ( rvs ) of the target stars were determined by cross - correlating our spectra with the kurucz solar spectrum , using the iraf _ fxcor _ routine ; the measurement uncertainties ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 km / s .",
    "heliocentric corrections to the measured velocities were obtained using the iraf _ rvcorrect _ routine .",
    "a log of the spectroscopic observations along with hst f606w magnitudes and parallaxes appears in table  [ table : obs ] .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we performed model atmosphere abundance analysis of our program stars in an iterative procedure , where the stellar temperatures ( t@xmath17 ) , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath2/fe ] and microturbulent velocities were determined from the ews of lines measured from the high s / n spectra .",
    "we used these t@xmath17 , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath2/fe ] values , together with published photometric data , to determine the logg indicated by the dsep theoretical isochrones .",
    "a check on the adopted isochrone logg is obtained from the [ fe / h ] determined from fe  ii lines , which are sensitive to the model atmosphere gravity .    in order to reduce systematic errors on [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath2/fe ] due to inaccurate line oscillator strengths ( loggf values )",
    ", we employed a line - by - line differential abundance analysis , relative to the same lines in the solar spectrum , similar to the method employed by @xcite .",
    "this method may also provide some mitigation for a number of systematic errors , due to incomplete input physics in the analysis ( e.g. blends , non - lte effects , 3d hydrodynamical effects ) .",
    "this differential analysis is facilitated by the fact that the gravities of the halo dwarfs are close to the solar value , while their temperatures are not too far from the solar t@xmath17 of 5777k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , irradiance measurements of @xcite indicate 5772 k for the sun .",
    "although we determined spectroscopic model atmosphere effective temperatures , we also checked for consistency with temperatures indicated by photometric colors and color - t@xmath17 relations .",
    "the photometric values also provided initial t@xmath17 estimates for the iterative abundance analysis .",
    "since unsaturated lines , on the linear portion of the curve of growth , have the greatest sensitivity to abundance , an ideal differential abundance analysis would employ only such weak , unsaturated , lines in both the sun and the metal - poor program stars .",
    "typically , unsaturated lines in solar - temperature dwarf stars have an equivalent width below @xmath183050m .",
    "however , lines that are 3050m  in the sun are in the 14m  range for our metal - poor dwarf stars . the need to measure the ew of such weak lines to high precision motivated the acquisition of very high s / n spectra for our metal - poor halo dwarf sample .",
    "ultimately however , the differential abundance scatter obtained was higher than we desired and the number of 14m  lines was insufficient to adequately constrain the atmosphere parameters and final [ fe / h ] for our program stars .    to address this problem",
    ", we chose to employ a standard star , with similar t@xmath17 and logg to the sun , but intermediate [ fe / h ] , in order to increase the number of unsaturated lines in the differential analysis . fortunately , we had a high s / n spectrum of the nearby metal - poor dwarf , hip66815 , suitable for this purpose .",
    "we also elected to include some stronger lines , which required an estimate of the microturbulent velocity .",
    "one should note that the method of spectroscopic determination of stellar atmosphere parameters is not universally accepted .",
    "@xcite caution against use of excitation equilibrium for determining stellar surface temperatures due to nlte effects and instead opt to use infrared flux method temperatures .",
    "specifically , they find that their differential approach , relative to the sun , is only capable of removing abundance trends as a function of excitation potential ( ep ) for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath19 dex and state that , for more metal - poor stars , the remaining trend is likely due to uncertainties associated with van der waals damping .",
    "there are important differences between @xcite and this study that are able to address these issues .",
    "@xcite choose an upper limit for their ew measurements of 180 m  as an attempt to minimize the influence of damped lines on their results . as can be seen by the results of their differential analysis for metal - poor stars ,",
    "this upper limit is still too high and their results are in fact influenced by the effects of damping . on the other hand , we use an upper limit of only 85 m  in our standard star , hip66815 , and our metal - poor ms stars , which corresponds to an upper limit of 120 130 m  in the sun .",
    "the authors also only use lines with ep@xmath20 ev and see that when they include lines with lower ep they are able to remove the trend in abundance with ep in their differential method .",
    "we use lines covering the full range of eps and , coupled with our more stringent ew upper limit , are able to resolve the issues presented by @xcite and remove abundance trends with excitation potential in our line - by - line differential abundance method .",
    "we manually measured the ews of fe and @xmath2-element spectral lines for each of the nine target metal - poor stars using the iraf _ splot _ routine for gaussian fits to the line profiles ; typical ew uncertainties were found to be @xmath213% , based on rms scatter around the best - fit profiles . several of the lines appeared on adjacent spectral orders in which case the final value used in the analysis was the average of the two measurements .",
    "these repeated lines also provided estimates of our ew measurement uncertainty .",
    "weak lines were specifically chosen because they are sufficiently sensitive to elemental abundance while also being insensitive to line damping or broadening mechanisms .",
    "for both fe lines and lines of @xmath2-elements , a lower limit of @xmath22 was established due to the uncertainty in the placement of the continuum level ; an upper limit of 85 m  was enforced to ensure the line behaved well in the linear portion of the curve of growth and wing damping did not affect the measurements .",
    "a total of 85 fe lines were taken from the studies of @xcite and @xcite supplemented with lines identified by @xcite with line parameters from the kurucz online database .",
    "a total of 36 @xmath2-element lines taken from @xcite were found to be suitable in the range of ew values .",
    "a final list of the measured ews for fe and @xmath2-elements are provided in tables  [ table : felines ] and [ table : alphalines ] , respectively .",
    "the line ews for our standard stars , the sun and hip66815 , are listed separately in table  [ table : ew66815 ] .",

    "we note , however , that the non - lte treatment is more appropriately performed with fully 3d atmospheres , not the averaged @xmath43d@xmath5 investigated by @xcite .",
    "such averaged models are really 1d , where ionizing photons must travel from great depths to distort the excitation and ionization of atoms in cooler regions in upper layers . in the case of fully 3d non - lte",
    ", hot rising bubbles could emit ionizing photons into horizontally adjacent cool regions , over much smaller distances than for the 1d case , possibly enhancing any non - lte effects .",
    "such a situation might lead to the ionization and excitation distortions apparent in this work .",
    "the improved accuracy we were hoping to achieve in this work led us to perform a detailed differential abundance analysis on nine metal - poor dwarf stars , but ultimately highlighted issues regarding the logg comparison to isochrones . given that separate non - lte and @xmath43d@xmath5 calculations do not predict the corrections needed to resolve the logg problem it is still possible that fully 3d hydrodynamics plus non - lte may be at the root of the problem .",
    "however , with [ fe / h ] values known to better than 0.1 dex and photometric observations that match theoretical isochrones within a small window of uncertainty we can now look forward to determining improved distances and ages of the oldest mw gcs . with gaia projected to provide even more accurate parallaxes in the coming years , it will only be a matter of time before we can not only solve the logg problem but have an extensive set of metal - poor stars to use in future calibrations .",

    "the authors also wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
