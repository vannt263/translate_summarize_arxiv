    "1997 ) , geo ( danzmann et al . 1997 ) and tama ( kuroda 1997 ) will produce a flood of data when they come online in a few years .",
    "advanced detectors in ligo / virgo and lcgt ( kuroda et al . 1999 ) will even be able to see neutron star binaries ( ns / ns ) out to cosmological redshifts . because the accuracy in the measurement of the signal strength can be better than 10% , and the accuracy in the measurement of the chirp mass ( which characterizes the frequency sweep of a binary inspiral ) can be better than 0.1%(finn & chernoff 1993 ; cutler & flanagan 1994 ) , observations of ns / ns inspiral events can be used to determine the universe s hubble constant , deceleration parameter and cosmological constant ( schutz 1986 , 1989 ; markovi 1993 ; chernoff & finn 1993 ; finn 1996 ; wang & turner 1997 ) . in particular , finn ( 1996 ) and",
    "wang & turner ( 1997 ) explicitly pointed out that the chirp mass spectrum of observed neutron star binary inspiral events can be quite sensitive to cosmological constant .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of using the future gravitational wave data to constrain dark energy , an exotic fluid component in the universe with an arbitrary equation of state , @xmath0 , whose existence has been well motivated by various astronomical observations and theoretical arguments ( refer to a recent review , turner 1999 ) . while the cosmological constant ( vacuum energy ) can apparently succeed in explaining the accelerating expansion of the universe which has stirred cosmologists after observations and measurements of distant ia type supernovae ( sneia ) ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ) , it suffers from the difficulty in understanding of the observed value in the framework of modern quantum field theory ( weinberg 1989 ; carroll et al . 1992 ) and the `` coincidence problem '' , the issue of explaining the initial conditions necessary to yield the near - coincidence of the densities of matter and the cosmological constant component today . in this case , a dark energy component with generally negative pressure has been invoked .",
    "examples of dark energy include the evolving scalar field ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ; zlatev et al .",
    "1999 ; steinhardt et al .",
    "1999 ) , the smooth noninteracting component ( turner & white 1997 ; chiba et al . 1997 ) and the frustrated network of topological defects in which @xmath2 , with n being the dimension of the defect ( spergel & pen 1997 ) . some observational constraints for these models",
    "have been extensively analyzed in the literature , including the redshift - luminosity distance relation based on distant sneia ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) , gravitational lensing statistics ( cooray & huterer 1999 ; zhu & cao 1999 ; zhu 2000 ) , einstein ring system ( futamase & hamana 1999 ) , the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) ( huey et al . 1999 ) , the angular size - redshift relation of distant extragalatic sources ( lima & alcaniz 2000a ) , the age of high - redshift galaxies ( lima & alcaniz 2000b ) , and the combinations of sneia measurements with either gravitational lensing ( waga & miceli 1999 ) or cmbr ( efstathiou 1999 ) or large - scale structure ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ) or the time variations of the redshift of quasars ( nakamura & chiba 1999 ) . a combined maximum likelihood analysis has suggested a range of equation - of - state for quintessence , @xmath3 ( see wang et al .",
    "2000 for an elegant summary ) .    because the determination of the amount and nature of dark energy is emerging as one of the most important challenges in cosmology , it is worthwhile to investigate other observational aspects of its equation of state . in this work , from calculating the expected chirp mass spectrum of observed ns / ns inspiral events for future gravitational wave detectors in the presence of a dark energy component , we find a sensitive dependence of chirp mass distribution on @xmath1 for a flat universe , which could provide an independent and robust constraint on the cosmic equation of state . for calculations of this work ,",
    "our notation and approach mainly follow those described by finn ( 1996 ) .",
    "the ns / ns inspirals are the targets for future gravitational wave detectors , whose merger rate at redshift @xmath4 per unit observer time interval per unit physical volume is , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 describes the ns / ns merge rate evolution , and @xmath7 is the local ns / ns merger rate per unit volume ( phinney 1991 ) . in the case of no proper evolution @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution of the ns / ns merger rate has been studied by several authors ( e.g. , tutukov & yungelson 1993 ; lipunov et al . 1995 ) . because recent observations of field galaxies out to redshift @xmath9 ( see e.g. madau et al . 1998 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) have provided a means of modeling the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) , one can now compute the birth and merger rates of binary systems by taking into account the time - delay . using population synthesis model , schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have calculated birth and merger rate evolution of various kinds of binaries . our best fit to their results for ns / ns merger rate from hierarchical scenario ( fig.8 of schneider et al .",
    "2000 ) takes @xmath10    for a ns / ns inspiral source located at redshift @xmath4 , the detectors measure its chirp mass , @xmath11 where the intrinsic chirp mass , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the binary s reduced and total mass respectively .",
    "therefore , the chirp mass spectrum represents directly the source redshift distribution if @xmath15 is constant . because we are considering ns / ns binaries ,",
    "@xmath16 will be used below , corresponding to a typical neutron star mass @xmath17 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath18 of an event observed by a given detector is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the luminosity distance from the detector to the source .",
    "@xmath21(@xmath22 for our case ) describes the overlap of the signal power with the detector bandwidth , while @xmath23 gives an overall sense of the depth to which the detector can reach .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of an inspiraling binary with a single interferometric detector depends on the relative orientation of the source , which is confined to the angular orientation function @xmath24 . from observations of binary inspiral in a single interferometer",
    "we can measure @xmath18 and @xmath25 but not @xmath24 .",
    "fortunately , even though @xmath24 can not be measured , its probability distribution can be approximated by ( finn 1996 ) @xmath26 which is related to @xmath27 , the probability distribution of signal - to - noise ratio of events with chirp mass @xmath28 , through @xmath29           \\nonumber\\\\   & &   \\times { d_l(z)\\over8 r_0 }          \\left(1.2\\,{\\rm m}_\\odot\\over{\\cal m}\\right)^{5/6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "then , in a homogeneous and isotropic universe we get the rate at which binary inspiral signals corresponding to chirp mass @xmath25 and @xmath18 greater than @xmath31 are detected @xmath32 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the angular diameter distance from the detector to the source , @xmath34 is the probability that a given detector receives a binary inspiral with chirp mass @xmath28 and signal - to - noise ratio greater than @xmath31 : @xmath35 an accumulation of observed ns / ns binary inspiral events will give a chirp mass spectrum @xmath36",
    "in order to explicitly show the dependence of the chirp mass spectrum on the cosmic equation of state , one needs to consider it in the context of general friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies in the presence of a dark energy component . for general frw cosmologies ,",
    "the metric of space time is described by ( in the @xmath37 unit ) : @xmath38 , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 for a flat universe ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 for a closed universe ( @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 for an open universe ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the comoving distance @xmath45 is ( zhu 1998 , zhu & cao 1999 ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 includes each component of matter and energy in the universe , @xmath48 parameterizes the effective equation of state for the @xmath47th - component , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the hubble constant ( @xmath52km@xmath53sec@xmath54mpc@xmath54 , @xmath55 ) and zero subscripts referring to the present epoch . various distance measures , including @xmath20 and @xmath56 that are essential to calculate the chirp mass spectrum eq.([cms ] ) can be easily inferred from the above comoving distance ( zhu 1998 , zhu & cao 1999 ) .",
    "[ spectrum-1 m ] explicitly demonstrates how the chirp mass spectrum depends sensitively on the equation of state @xmath1 with both cases of ns / ns merger rate nonevolution ( solid lines ) and evolution ( dash - dot lines ) .",
    "we have use two detector depths , @xmath57mpc for lcgt ( left panel ) and @xmath58mpc for ligoii ( right panel ) , respectively . in our calculations",
    ", we use a flat universe : @xmath59 with a constant @xmath60 , the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath61 and the signal - to - noise ratio threshold @xmath62 .",
    "as it is shown , there exists a sensitive dependence of the chirp mass spectrum of ns / ns binary inspiral on the cosmic equation - of - state . in general the smaller @xmath1 ,",
    "the more compressed the spectrum , and the smaller the tail at large @xmath28 . this fact may provide an independent and robust constraint on the cosmic equation of state .",
    "the solid lines of fig .  [ spectrum-1 m ] are for the case of ns / ns merger rate nonevolution , @xmath8 . unfortunately the evolution rate is probably much strong .",
    "the dash - dot lines of fig .",
    "[ spectrum-1 m ] are based on the result of schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( eq.([evolution ] ) ) .",
    "as is shown , the merger rate evolution makes the spectrum less compressed and extends the tail towards large @xmath28 , which is exactly opposite to the effect for lowering @xmath1 . because uncertainties in the merger rate evolution directly lead to uncertainties in determining the cosmological equation of state , the contraints on dark energy from gravitational wave detectors could not be robust until we understand well the cosmic evolution of the ns / ns binary merger rate .",
    "another uncertainty of the method proposed here comes from the degenerate between the cosmic equation of state , @xmath1 , and the cosmic matter density , @xmath63 .",
    "[ spectrum-2 m ] explicitly shows how @xmath63 changes the spectrum . a spectrum for a flat universe with lower @xmath63 and larger @xmath1 may overlap with the one for a flat universe with higher @xmath63 and smaller @xmath1 .",
    "one need an independent cosmological test to break down this degenerate , such as clusters of galaxies , gravitational lensing or the anisotropy of cmbr etc .",
    "last but not least , neutron star masses are not all identical ( @xmath64 ) , but distribute between a lower bound ( e.g. @xmath65 ) and a upper bound ( e.g. @xmath66 ) .",
    "this would introduce another probability function into eqs.([proh ] ) & ( [ dndot ] ) . using a uniform distribution model , finn ( 1996 )",
    "shows that , the chirp mass spectrum will broaden symmetrically as the mass distribution broadens .",
    "although the effect is different from the cosmic equation of state , the uncertainty of neutron star mass distribution will also lead the uncertainty into the constraints on dark energy from future gravitational wave events catalogue .    as is shown above ,",
    "the constraints on the cosmic equation of state from the chirp mass spectrum of ns / ns merger events is promising , but it needs to appeal to statisitics , evolution and neutron star mass distributions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , if ns / ns merger events are observed to be associated with gamma - ray bursts , one could measure the redshift of these events through the galaxies hosting the associated grbs . then a few ns / ns merger events would determine the cosmic equation of state as what the high-@xmath4 snia has done .",
