    "ganga et al . ( 1997a , hereafter grgs ) developed a general method to account for experimental and observational uncertainties , such as those in the beamwidth and the calibration , in likelihood analyses of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data sets . in conjunction with theoretically - predicted cmb anisotropy spectra , this method has been used to account for beamwidth and calibration uncertainties in analyses of the gundersen et al .",

    "in this paper we present results from a similar analysis of the argo cmb anisotropy data set , but now consider a much larger range of cosmological - model parameter space .",
    "the 1993 flight of the balloon - borne argo experiment resulted in two data sets .",
    "one was from data taken in the direction of hercules ( de bernardis et al .",
    "1994a , hereafter deb94 ) , and the second consisted of data taken in the direction of aries and taurus ( masi et al .",
    "in addition to the cmb signal , the aries and taurus data set is known to have a significant foreground dust signal in the shorter wavelength data with milder contamination in the longest wavelength data ( masi et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) . to use the aries and taurus data to investigate cmb anisotropy one must carefully model this foreground dust contamination ( masi et al . 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we therefore only consider the deb94 hercules data .",

    "de bernardis et al .",
    "( 1994b ) discuss the constraints that follow from the argo hercules data on some cold dark matter ( cdm ) and other cosmological models .",
    "argo data were taken in four wavelength bands centered at 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.2 , and 2.0 mm ( deb94 ) .",
    "while there is dust contamination in the shorter wavelength data , the longest wavelength data is thought to be pure cmb anisotropy ( deb94 ) . following deb94 we use only the 2 mm data for our cmb anisotropy analyses here .",
    "the fwhm of the beam , assumed to be gaussian , is @xmath7 , with a @xmath8 one standard deviation uncertainty .",
    "while observing , the beam was sinusoidally chopped with a half peak - to - peak chop amplitude of @xmath9 on the sky .",
    "63 points were observed with the payload performing azimuth step and integrate scans at constant elevation .",
    "this scan strategy , combined with sky rotation , produced a w - like scan pattern in equatorial coordinates ( figure 1 of deb94 ) , sparsely sampling a region 1 hour wide in right ascension and 15@xmath10 wide in declination .",
    "deb94 remove a single offset from the entire data set prior to binning .",
    "the argo hercules scan absolute calibration uncertainty is @xmath11 ( one standard deviation ) , is a higher standard deviation calibration uncertainty . ] .",
    "argo data is able to robustly constrain the normalization of the cmb spectra .",
    "however , argo alone is unable to strongly constrain the other cosmological parameters considered .",
    "robust constraints on these cosmological parameters will require a combined likelihood analysis of many cmb anisotropy data sets ( including argo ) .",
    "in this paper we use the argo data set as a basis for developing a formalism that will eventually allow such a combined analysis .    in @xmath122",
    "we summarize the computational techniques used in our analysis .",

    "ganga et al . 1997b , 1998 ; ratra et al .",
    "1998 ) , only a few ( 25 ) spectra were used . in this paper",
    "we use 798 spectra to cover a greatly extended range of the cosmological parameter space of the open and spatially - flat-@xmath0 cdm models , and cover it with a higher resolution grid than previously used .",
    "this allows for an explicit construction of the full likelihood function as a function of all the cosmological parameters considered , and for making the various likelihood functions derived by marginalizing over parameters .",
    "this had not previously been possible .",
    "we focus here on a spatially open cdm model and a spatially flat cdm model with a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",

    "the models have gaussian , adiabatic primordial energy - density power spectra .",
    "the flat-@xmath0 model cmb anisotropy computations use a scale - invariant energy - density perturbation power spectrum ( harrison 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) , as predicted in the simplest spatially - flat inflation models ( guth 1981 ; kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , b ) .",
    "the open model computations use the energy - density power spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994 , 1995 ; bucher , goldhaber , & turok 1995 ; yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1995 ) predicted in the simplest open - bubble inflation models ( gott 1982 ; guth & weinberg 1983 ) .",
    "the computation of the cmb anisotropy spectra is described in stompor ( 1994 ) and sugiyama ( 1995 ) .",
    "the spectra are parameterized by their quadrupole - moment amplitude @xmath13 , the clustered - mass density parameter @xmath1 , the baryonic - mass density parameter @xmath2 , and the age of the universe @xmath4 .",
    "we have evaluated the spectra for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.1 , for a range of @xmath14 [ the hubble parameter @xmath15 spanning the interval 0.005 to 0.029 in steps of 0.004 , and for a range of @xmath4 spanning the interval 10 to 20 gyr in steps of 2 gyr .",
    "current observational estimates are more consistent with @xmath16 ( e.g. , cole et al .",

    "1998 ) , with @xmath17 gyr ( e.g. , reid 1997 ; gratton et al .",

    "we emphasize however that the results of the analysis are model dependent .",
    "for instance , tilted flat-@xmath0 models at fixed @xmath14 would likely lead to a different constraint on @xmath1 than that derived below in the scale - invariant flat-@xmath0 model with varying @xmath14 .",
    "grgs describe the computation of the likelihood function . since deb94 remove an offset from the data , we assume a uniform prior in the amplitude of the offset removed and marginalize over this amplitude when computing the likelihood function ( bond et al .",
    "1991 , bunn et al . 1994",
    "; grgs ; church et al .",
    "1997 ; ratra et al .",
    "this must be done since the removal of the offset also removes an undetermined amount of the cmb anisotropy signal from the data .",
    "beamwidth and calibration uncertainties are accounted for as described in grgs .",
    "the open and flat-@xmath0 model likelihoods are a function of four parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we also compute marginalized likelihood functions by integrating over one or more of these parameters after assuming a uniform prior in the relevant parameters .",
    "the prior is set to zero outside the ranges considered for the parameters .",
    "to derive central values and limits from the likelihood functions we assume a uniform prior in the relevant parameter , so the corresponding posterior probability density distribution function vanishes outside the chosen parameter range and is equal to the likelihood function inside this range .",
    "the deduced central value of the parameter is taken to be the value at which the posterior probability density peaks .",
    "the limits we quote are based on the highest posterior density ( hpd ) prescription .",
    "they are determined by integrating the posterior probability density starting at the peak and minimizing the difference between the upper and lower limits .",
    "the @xmath19 @xmath6 and @xmath20 @xmath6 hpd limits encompass 68.3% and 95.5% of the area , respectively .",
    "see grgs for further details .",
    "of course , the quoted limits depend on the prior range considered for the parameter , if the likelihood function is not sharply peaked within the range considered .",
    "this is the case for a number of the likelihood functions obtained below .",
    "for the flat bandpower spectrum the argo likelihood peaks at bandtemperature @xmath21k , with a 1 @xmath6 range of @xmath22 and likelihood ratio = @xmath23 . for the fiducial cdm model spectrum @xmath24k , with 1 @xmath6 range @xmath25 and likelihood ratio @xmath26 .",
    "these numerical values account for the marginalization over the offset removed from the data , as well as the beamwidth and calibration uncertainties . for fiducial cdm deb94",
    "find that the likelihood peaks at @xmath27k , with 1 @xmath6 range @xmath28 and likelihood ratio = @xmath29 .",
    "the deb94 1 @xmath6 range accounts for calibration uncertainty by adding it in quadrature to the error bars derived ignoring it , but ignores offset removal and beamwidth uncertainty . the difference between the numerical values derived in deb94 and here is mostly because they have not marginalized over the amplitude of the offset removed while we have .    for the flat bandpower spectrum the argo average 1 @xmath6 @xmath30 error bar is @xmath31 : argo data results in a very significant detection of cmb anisotropy , even after accounting for beamwidth and calibration uncertainties . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding dmr error bar is @xmath32 ( depending on model , grski et al .",
    "the max 4 + 5 data set also results in a small error bar @xmath33 ( ganga et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath30 values estimated using the flat bandpower and fiducial cdm spectra are not identical .",
    "the variation in the deduced @xmath30 values from model to model is an indication of the accuracy of the flat bandpower approximation to the real spectrum over the range of the window function of the experiment .",
    "the variation from model to model found here is comparable to that found from the sp94 and max 4 + 5 data ( grgs ; ganga et al .",
    "1998 ) but is smaller than that found from the suzie and white dish data ( ganga et al . 1997b ; ratra et al . 1998 ) .    for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models ,",
    "the four - dimensional posterior probability density distribution function @xmath34 is nicely peaked in the @xmath13 direction but quite flat in the other three directions .",
    "the dotted lines in figure 3 illustrate this flatness in the @xmath35 subspace of the flat-@xmath0 model .",
    "note that it is possible to distinguish between regions of parameter space at only slightly better than 0.25 @xmath6 confidence .",
    "the irregular solid lines in figure 5 are the 2 @xmath6 contours of the four - dimensional posterior distribution projected on to the @xmath36 subspace .",
    "they clearly show the steepness and peak ( solid circles ) in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath13 results in a three - dimensional posterior distribution @xmath37 which is steeper .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 3 are the contours of this function .",
    "note that it is now possible to distinguish between regions of parameter space at better than 1 @xmath6 confidence .",
    "marginalizing over one more parameter ( in addition to @xmath13 ) results in two - dimensional posterior probability distribution functions which are peaked ( albeit , in most cases , at an edge of the parameter range considered , see the solid circle in figure 3 ) .",
    "it is now possible to distinguish between parts of parameter space at better than 3 @xmath6 confidence  see the solid lines in figure 3 .    as discussed below , caution must be exercised when interpreting the discriminative power of these formal limits , since they depend sensitively on the values of the parameters beyond which the uniform prior has been set to zero .",
    "figure 3 also illustrates a point noted earlier in the analysis of the max 4 + 5 data set ( ganga et al . 1998 ) : conclusions about the most favored model drawn from the full four - dimensional posterior distribution tend to differ from those deduced from the three - dimensional posterior distribution derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional one over @xmath13 .",
    "for example , from a similar plot of the @xmath38 subspace of the open model ( not shown ) , one finds that the four - dimensional distribution favors a large value of @xmath39 , while the three - dimensional distribution favors a small @xmath40 .",
    "as discussed in ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this is a consequence of the asymmetry of the posterior distribution .",
    "this is not a significant issue since at the 2 @xmath6 confidence level the four - dimensional posterior distribution is flat in the @xmath1 direction and so it is not statistically meaningful to discuss how it varies with @xmath1 .    as mentioned above , the two - dimensional posterior distributions ( derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional distribution over two parameters at a time ) allows one to distinguish between regions of parameter space at a higher level of confidence .",
    "figure 4 illustrates this for the three cosmological parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath4 ) , for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models .",
    "certain parts of parameter space can now be formally ruled out at better than 2 @xmath6 significance .",
    "for example , for the open model a region in parameter space centered near @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 gyr is ruled out at 3 @xmath6 .",
    "again , caution must be exercised when interpreting the discriminative power of such formal limits .",
    "figure 5 shows the contours of the two - dimensional posterior distribution for @xmath13 and @xmath1 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional distribution over @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "these are shown for the argo , dmr , sp94 , max 4 + 5 , white dish , and suzie data sets , for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models .",
    "for all but the dmr data we also show 2 @xmath6 confidence contours determined from projecting the four - dimensional posterior distribution on to this ( @xmath13 , @xmath1 ) subspace .",
    "clearly , at 2 @xmath6 , constraints on these parameters derived from the argo data are mostly consistent with those derived from the other data sets . however , the dmr and argo data are more consistent for an open model than for the flat-@xmath0 case , panels @xmath44 and @xmath45 of figure 5 .",
    "in fact , there is very little overlap between the 2 @xmath6 ranges ( derived from the two - dimensional posterior distributions ) of the argo and dmr normalizations for the flat-@xmath0 models .",
    "there is , however , significant overlap between the 2 @xmath6 ranges derived by projecting the argo and dmr four - dimensional posterior distributions and @xmath4 , the confidence contours derived from this distribution projected on to the ( @xmath13 , @xmath1 ) plane are close to those derived from this distribution marginalized over @xmath14 and @xmath4 . ] .",
    "the sp94 results shown in panels @xmath46 and @xmath47 are those derived from the full ka+q data set . sample variance and noise considerations indicate that the sp94 ka band data is more consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy data ( grgs ) . at fixed @xmath1",
    "the ka band data results in a lower deduced @xmath13 ( compared to that from the ka+q data , grgs ) , so the sp94 ka band results are more consistent with the argo results .",
    "the max 4 + 5 results shown in panels @xmath48 and @xmath49 of figure 5 are those derived from the max 4 i d and sh and max 5 hr , mp , and ph data sets . sample variance and noise considerations indicate that the max 4 i d and max 5 hr data are more consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy data ( ganga et al .",
    "this subset of the max 4 + 5 data has a lower @xmath13 ( ganga et al .",
    "1998 ) and is thus more consistent with the argo data .",
    "the python ( platt et al . 1997 ) and saskatoon ( netterfield et al . 1997 ) experiments are also sensitive to angular scales probed by argo .",
    "the python large - chop result and some of the relevant saskatoon @xmath50-point chop results are larger than the argo result . on the other hand , some of the saskatoon @xmath50-point chop results are consistent with the argo result .",
    "figure 6 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath4 , and @xmath13 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional posterior distribution over the other three parameters . from these one - dimensional posterior distributions ,",
    "argo data favors an open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model with either @xmath1 = 0.23 ( 0.10 ) , or @xmath14 = 0.029 ( 0.020 ) , or @xmath4 = 20 ( 12 ) gyr , amongst the models considered .",
    "we emphasize that each of these are derived from one - dimensional posterior distributions and thus can not be simultaneously imposed .",
    "also shown in figure 6 are the limits derived from the one - dimensional distributions and the ( projected ) four - dimensional distribution . at 2 @xmath6 confidence",
    "the argo data only formally rules out small regions of parameter space .",
    "specifically , from the one - dimensional posterior distributions , the argo data requires @xmath1 @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( @xmath1 @xmath53 ) , or @xmath14 @xmath54 ( @xmath14 @xmath54 ) , or @xmath4 @xmath55 gyr ( @xmath4 @xmath56 gyr ) for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model at 2 @xmath6 .",
    "since some of the one - dimensional posterior distributions peak at the edge of the parameter range considered some of these limits must be considered to be formal .",
    "less controversially , it is clear that , for both open and flat-@xmath0 models , argo data favors a low - density universe , although @xmath57 is not strongly ruled out .",
    "similarly , argo data also mildly favors a relatively large @xmath14 or a young ( old ) flat-@xmath0 ( open ) model .",
    "as discussed above , argo results in fairly tight constraints on @xmath13 ( panels @xmath58 and @xmath59 of figure 6 ) , and these are more consistent with the dmr results for the open model than for the flat-@xmath0 case .",
    "care is needed when interpreting the discriminative power of such formal limits .",
    "consider a posterior density function which is a gaussian and nicely peaked inside the parameter range considered .",
    "the 1 and 2 @xmath6 hpd limits for such a gaussian correspond to a value of the posterior distribution relative to that at the peak of 0.61 and 0.14 respectively . for the open model posterior distributions shown in figure 6",
    ", the 1 and 2 @xmath6 hpd limits correspond to values of the posterior distribution relative to that at the peak of 0.63 & 0.56 ( @xmath1 ) , 0.95 & 0.91 ( @xmath14 ) , 0.93 & 0.86 ( @xmath4 ) , and 0.36 & 0.13 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is hence probably fairer to conclude that the formal argo statistical limits on @xmath14 and @xmath4 , and the 2 @xmath6 limits on @xmath1 , should be taken much less seriously than those on @xmath13 , and the 1 @xmath6 limits on @xmath1 .",
    "in our likelihood analyses of the argo hercules scan cmb anisotropy data we have explicitly accounted for beamwidth and calibration uncertainties and have marginalized over the amplitude of the offset removed from the data . as a consequence the results derived here differ from those derived earlier .",
    "the argo results are mostly consistent with those derived from the dmr , sp94 , max 4 + 5 , white dish and suzie data sets .",
    "we emphasize again that the argo results , as well as those derived for the other data sets , depend on the models considered .    while the argo data does significantly constrain @xmath13 ( and mildly constrain @xmath1 ) , robust constraints on these and other cosmological parameters from the cmb anisotropy must await a models - based combined likelihood analysis of many different data sets .",
