    "laws of quantum physics enable to process and transmit information in ways that would be impossible or very difficult to achieve classically .",
    "prime example is the unconditionally secure quantum key distribution that is already approaching the stage of commercial applications @xcite .",
    "most of the developed quantum communication protocols employ light as a carrier and processing medium .",
    "quantum information needs however not only to be transmitted and processed , but it requires also storage facilities .",
    "storage of quantum information can not be accomplished using classical means , but it requires a special - quantum - memory . quantum memory is indispensable for construction of quantum repeaters @xcite that combine it with entanglement distillation and swapping to efficiently distribute entanglement over lossy and noisy quantum channels .",
    "a very promising medium for quantum memory are ensembles of atoms trapped in the electromagnetic field @xcite or held in a glass cell @xcite .",
    "ultimately , quantum memory should allow to store a quantum state of one or several modes of the electromagnetic field , and not only states of single photons .",
    "particularly promising for this purpose appears to be the off - resonant quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) coupling between a collective ( pseudo)-spin of the atomic ensemble and the polarization of light beam @xcite .",
    "this setting involves an auxiliary coherent laser beam that mediates the coupling between an atomic ensemble and a light mode whose quantum state should be stored to the atoms . using large atomic ensembles and strong auxiliary laser beams",
    "leads to a collective enhancement of the atoms - light coupling .",
    "consequently , sufficiently strong interaction can be achieved even without a cavity just by a single passage of light through the atomic sample @xcite , which greatly simplifies the experiment .",
    "the qnd coupling has been explored in several landmark experiments to entangle states of two atomic ensembles @xcite , to store quantum state of a light beam onto the collective spin of atoms @xcite , and to teleport quantum state of light onto atoms @xcite .",
    "besides quantum information processing applications , the qnd coupling can be also used to generate spin squeezed state of the atomic ensemble that can enhance precision of atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "collective spin degree of freedom of atomic ensemble can be described by collective atomic spin operators @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by making the expectation value of one of these operators sufficiently large , the other two manifest similar algebraic properties as quadrature operators of light .",
    "the qnd coupling between atoms and light can then be described by linear input - output transformations of the effective quadrature operators of atoms and light @xcite .",
    "this greatly simplifies theoretical analysis of atomic memory operation @xcite but also somewhat restricts possible manipulations with memory .",
    "experimentally easily accessible coherent and squeezed light beams are described by gaussian wigner functions and all such states are referred to as gaussian states . using gaussian light states and qnd coupling , possibly combined with homodyne detection on output light and feedback , we can implement only gaussian operations on the atomic memory and prepare only gaussian states in the memory starting from initial gaussian state .",
    "certain applications , notably continuous - variable entanglement distillation , however require non - gaussian operations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to investigate schemes for implementation of non - gaussian operations and filters on the quantum - memory state and devise procedures for preparation of arbitrary highly nonclassical states of atomic quantum memory .",
    "previously , scheme for generation of a superposition of two coherent spin states of an atomic ensemble has been proposed @xcite and a protocol for probabilistic noise - free upload of single - photon and schrdinger cat - like states into atomic memory has been suggested @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for conditional preparation of arbitrary coherent superpositions of atomic dicke states @xmath3 , @xmath4 let @xmath5 denotes the number of atoms in the ensemble .",
    "the quantum memory typically exploits coherence between two atomic zeeman or hyperfine levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the dicke state @xmath3 is then defined as a fully symmetric state of all @xmath5 atoms with @xmath8 atoms in state @xmath6 and @xmath9 atoms in state @xmath7 . in the limit of large @xmath5 ,",
    "the states @xmath3 become formally equivalent to the @xmath8-photon fock states of light .",
    "the general idea behind our protocol is to manipulate the atomic state by qnd interaction with light that has been previously prepared in a specific highly non - classical quantum state .",
    "this technique allows us to employ qnd interaction to implement operations on atomic ensemble that are not easy to perform directly on atoms , but are more feasible on light .",
    "in particular , we show that by using light beam prepared in photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum state @xcite we could implement an operation on the atomic memory that is similar to single - photon subtraction / addition .",
    "this elementary non - gaussian operation can be combined with coherent displacements of atomic state and repeated several times to conditionally generate a wide class of superpositions ( [ eq : objectif ] ) .",
    "the resulting scheme is analogous to protocols for generation of arbitrary superpositions of fock states of traveling light beams by repeated photon addition or subtraction @xcite , but it exhibits important differences due to the qnd coupling and the need for conditioning on the outcomes of homodyne detection on the output light beam . we analyze in detail influence of various relevant experimental parameters on the performance of the protocol and show how it can be optimized in order to maximize the fidelity of generated state for a given probability of success .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will review the basics of qnd coupling between light and atoms and derive a general formula for the operation performed on atoms . in sec .",
    "iii we explain how the elementary non - gaussian operation can be combined with magnetic - field induced atomic displacement operator in order to generate various superpositions of states @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in section  iv , the procedure is generalized to multiple repeated application of non - gaussian operation and coherent displacement , which allows to generate wide class of superpositions ( [ eq : objectif ] ) .",

    "v. in section  vi we show that by controlling which atomic quadrature couples to light we can in principle generate arbitrary complex superpositions ( [ eq : objectif ] ) . in sec .",
    "vii we discuss an alternative procedure for direct single - step preparation of atomic state by using a specifically prepared highly non - classical state of light , which is then imprinted onto atoms . finally , section  viii contains a brief summary and conclusions .",

    "formula ( [ eq : theta_fourier ] ) reveals that in order to apply a non - gaussian operation on the atomic state we need non - gaussian state of light beam @xmath13 .",
    "recently , highly non - gaussian states of traveling light beam exhibiting negative wigner function have been generated by photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum @xcite . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qnd ] , squeezed light beam is generated in an optical parametric amplifier and then impinges on a highly unbalanced beam splitter bs with nearly unit transmissivity .",
    "click of the single - photon detector apd indicates with high probability a subtraction of single photon because probability that two or more photons are reflected is negligible .",
    "the resulting conditional transformation can be described by the action of annihilation operator on the initial squeezed state , @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] denotes the squeezing operator and @xmath37 is the vacuum state .",

    "we can see that the @xmath44 operator acts simultaneously as a combination of creation and annihilation operator and a squeezing operator . as shown in next section",
    ", this property can be exploited to generate ( squeezed ) superpositions of higher dicke states .",
    "displacement operator @xmath47 can be easily implemented on atomic ensemble by application of magnetic field resulting in a tiny rotation of the collective atomic spin .",
