    "solid - state qubits are considered to be promising candidates for realizing building blocks of quantum information processors . in past few years",
    ", many kinds of these qubit models are introduced and many efforts not only theoretical but also experimental have been performed on investigating the decoherence , relaxation and manipulation for these qubit models .",
    "most of the investigations for these models are considered them as a spin - boson model which is modeled with a two - level system coupled to a bath and the bath always constructed with a set of hamonic oscillators . the qubits can be manipulated with a driven field @xcite , so a more realistic description requires the inclusion of an external control field in the qubit - bath model .",

    "finally , a rate of purity decay for this model is obtained and discussed .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the case of a persistent current qubit based on josephson junction @xcite .",
    "it is driven with the magnetic flux through the loop and damped predominantly by flux noise with gaussian statistics .",
    "this setup is accurately expressed by the driven spin - boson ( dsb ) model @xcite@xmath0where@xmath1here , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are pauli matrices .",

    "having obtained a master equation describing the evolution of a controllable solid state qubit system coupled to an ohmic bath , we now proceed to examine the consequences of that evolution . in the following",
    "we shall analyze the problem with two different methods . at first",
    ", we use the coefficients in the master equation to detect the instantaneous effects of the environment .",
    "then we can investigate the time evolution of the purity .",
    "for the first method , all the effects including controlled external field and uncontrolled environment are considered in the above coefficients .",
    "these coefficients are to renormalize the frequency as well as to introduce the decay of the system . from these equations",
    ", it is possible to have a qualitative idea of the effects for the environment producing on the system .",
    "first , we can observe that the effective hamiltonian @xmath64 is evolved with time - dependence .",
    "the system hamiltonian @xmath65 and the coupling hamiltonian @xmath19 do not commute with each other and the evolution of @xmath64 is periodic because the driven controlled field is periodic .",
    "the term @xmath66 is the shift in frequency which produces the renomalized frequency .",
    "this term does not affect the unitarity of the evolution .",
    "the terms @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are diffusive terms and bring about non - unitary effects .",
    "the terms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the dissipation coefficients related to the dissipation kernel @xmath72 defined already , which play the role of a time - dependent relaxation rate , are independent of temperature .",
    "and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the diffusion coefficients , which produce the decoherence effects , they are not only time - dependent but depend on temperature . of cause , the explicit time dependence of the coefficients can only be computed once we specify the spectral density of the environment . to illustrate their qualitative behavior ,",
    "we focus on the case that the environment is the ohmic bath in the following , whose spectral density of the ohmic bath can be expressed as @xmath73where @xmath74 is the physical high - frequency cutoff , which represents the highest frequency presented in the environment and the parameter @xmath75 is dimensionless parameter reflecting the strength of dissipation .",
    "we set @xmath76 as in @xcite .",
    "we can plot the diffusive terms @xmath77 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as fig.1.@xmath78it is shown that all these plots appear to be a periodically diverging function , which stems not only from  the periodic control driven field but also from the bath , and the peaks of @xmath67 is much higher than that of @xmath79 and @xmath69 .",
    "it means that the term proportional to @xmath67 in eq . ( 18 ) plays the main role to decoherence .",
    "the form of the decoherence coefficient @xmath67 @xcite is not necessarily intuitive , so we evaluate it numerically as fig.2 .",
    "@xmath80one of the parameters ( @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 ) is varied in figs.2 ( a , b , c ) .",
    "all of the plots demonstrate the same basic behavior : @xmath67 decreases with periodic oscillations .",
    "it is shown that the influence of the heat bath to the decoherence of the qubit can be described by these coefficients of the master equation .",
    "it can also be described by a computationally convenient way , namely the linear entropy @xmath84 which is another measure of the purity of a quantum state . for the pure state",
    "it is approximative equals to @xmath85 so we shall study the evolution of the purity of the system as measured by @xmath86 for simplicity @xcite .",
    "it is equal to one for a pure state and decreases when the state of the system gets mixed because the destruction of quantum coherence is generated by evolution . by virtue of the master equation",
    ", we can easily obtain an evolution for the purity @xmath87 and the equation we obtained is:@xmath88setting the initial state is pure then @xmath89 .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite we can obtain @xmath90it is interesting that the eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) only correspond to the decoherence coefficient @xmath67 .",
    "it is shown that the purity decay rate is proportional to the decoherence coefficient @xmath67 , and do not include any other coefficients .",
    "it confirms that @xmath67 plays the main role in decoherence which is analyzed in the above section in detail . from eq.([21 ] ) we can also see that the larger the rate of the purity is , the smaller the decoherence becomes . in fig.3 , we plot the evolutions of the state purity with time @xmath53 .    @xmath91    it is show that the purity of qubit decreases fast with the increasing of the amplitude and decreasing of the frequency of the driven control field .",
    "this is agree with the result in ref.@xcite that the low frequency driven field is destructive to the coherence of the qubit .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of the environment for a solid state qubit coupled with a driven control field . at first , instead of solving the master equation we investigated the coefficients in the equation which express the shift in frequency , diffusive , decoherence and so on . here",
    "we suppose the environment is modeled with a ohmic bath and it is coupled with the qubit linearly .",
    "it shows that the term proportional to the coefficient @xmath67 in master equation plays the main role to the decoherence .",
    "then , we concretely investigated the decay of purity .",
    "it is shown that the decay rate of purity behaves fast as the amplitude increasing and the frequency decreasing of the driven field .",
    "it is suggested that if the driven field is necessary for some qubit system a higher frequency may help to decrease the decoherence .",
