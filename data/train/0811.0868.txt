    "most , if not all , of these planets are expected to be gaseous giants in contrast to the terrestrial planets in our solar system .",
    "the central star of 55 cnc and the dynamics of its system have kept observers occupied for other reasons as well :    1 .",
    "this star is the primary in a visual binary ( separation @xmath1910@xmath20  au ) and belongs to a group of @xmath1930 multiple stellar systems in which giant planets are seen orbiting very close to the primary stars ( eggenberger et al .",

    "the three inner planets of 55 cnc , with orbital periods @xmath22 days and eccentricities @xmath23 , all fit precisely this trend .",
    "2 .   the primary star of 55 cnc has very high metallicity compared to the sun ( @xmath24 ; gonzalez & vanture 1998 ; valenti & fischer 2005 ) , a property that has been associated with a higher probability of forming massive protoplanetary cores and gaseous giant planets in the surrounding , also metal  rich , disk by the process of core accretion ( ida & lin 2004b ; bodenheimer & pollack 1986 ; pollack et al .",
    "it seemed for a time that an extended disk of dust was visible in the infrared , but this result was negated when additional infrared observations failed to detect a disk ( schneider et al .",
    "2001 ; bryden et al . 2006 ) and submillimeter observations indicated that the excess flux could be attributed to background sources ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "4 .   the orbits of the two more massive of the inner planets , 55 cnc b and c , appear to be close to but not quite in mean  motion resonance with a period ratio of nearly 3:1 ( marcy et al .",
    "2002 ; fischer et al .",
    "this is the only known 3:1 apparent resonant pair , whereas in all the other known cases the planets appear to have been captured in 2:1 resonances ( butler et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the picture that emerges from the observations of 55 cnc is enigmatic .",
    "the most important questions can be summarized as follows ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) : why did this star end up with so many massive planets when 90% of the observed stars do not have any giants at all ?",
    "the similarities to our solar system seem to indicate that multiple ",
    "planet systems like 55 cnc ( and @xmath25 ara ara ( hd 160691 , gj 691 ) also has a gaseous giant orbiting beyond 5  au ( @xmath26  au ) and 3 additional giants orbiting close to the star ( santos et al .",
    "2004 ; pepe et al . 2007 ; and table  5 below ) .",
    "their distribution shows a large gap between 1.5 and 5.2  au ; but the orbital eccentricities of the inner planets are comparatively larger ( @xmath27 ) than those in 55 cnc ( see also   [ muara ] ) . ] ) should be common , but why have they not been observed in larger numbers ? and if such multi  planet systems around metal  rich stars represent the new norm of planet evolution ( ida & lin 2004b ) , where are the systems with central stars chemically similar to our sun ?",
    "one would certainly be reluctant to admit that our solar system is special because of the inherent bias associated with such a proposition .",
    "in addition , were the inner planets of 55 cnc ( and @xmath25 ara ) formed `` in  situ '' on the observed orbits ( lissauer 1995 ; bodenheimer et al .",
    "2000 ) , or are they the result of inward migration ( ward & hahn 2000 ; lin et al .",
    "2000 ; armitage et al . 2002 ; alibert et al . 2004 , 2005a , 2006 ) that terminated conveniently ( marcy et al .",
    "2000 ; trilling et al . 2002 ; eggenberger et al .",
    "2004 ) to allow for the planets to survive and circularize their orbits ? and why are all the planetary orbits in 55 cnc so nearly circular when large eccentricities are quite common in exoplanets ( marcy et al .",
    "2000 , 2005 ) and it appears that resonant tidal interactions did not take hold since an actual 3:1 commensurability was not established ? finally , could there be smaller planets or an asteroid belt in the 5  au gap and , in any case , why was matter acquisition so disparate as to produce a series of smaller planets surrounded by two very massive planets , 55 cnc b and d ? finding answers to even some of these questions can be a giant step toward understanding planet formation and evolution .",
    "we will revisit the underlying issues in ",
    "[ questions ] below .",
    "the observations of 55 cnc have motivated several empirical modeling efforts that attempted to explore the various compelling issues that arise from the impressive regularity of this planetary system , the existence of the 5  au gap , and the unusual chemical properties of the parent star :    1 .",
    "_ metal  rich environment for planet formation_. ida & lin ( 2004a , b , 2005 ) carried out monte carlo simulations of protoplanetary core growth , orbital migration , and gas acquisition .",
    "their model predicts that the probability of forming gas giants increases rapidly with increasing metal abundances in the host stars and the surrounding disks , which is consistent with the multitude of planets observed in 55 cnc and @xmath25 ara . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical and orbital properties of these planets are in disagreement with the main features of this model , namely that there should not be planets with @xmath28 earth masses at @xmath29  au and that short  period , neptune  size planets should not be common around such g - type stars as opposed to m dwarfs .",
    "this led ida & lin ( 2005 ) to speculate that the planets seen in 55 cnc and @xmath25 ara have not migrated to their present locations but they were instead formed in ",
    "situ with the help of sweeping mean  motion or secular resonances .",
    "however , there is no evidence that gas - giant migration or resonances ever played a role in the formation of these planets , and this adds to the mystery surrounding such well  ordered planetary systems .    2 .",
    "_ long  term orbital stability_. the stability of the planetary orbits in 55 cnc has been investigated independently by several groups : raymond & barnes ( 2005 ) integrated the orbits of the 3 most massive planets ( b  d ) for 100 myr and found that the system could afford to have more planets in stable orbits between planets c and d. fischer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) integrated the orbits of all 5 planets for 1 myr and found that planets b and c are not locked into a 3:1 mean  motion resonance .",
    "gayon et al .",
    "( 2008 ) integrated the orbits of all 5 planets for 400 myr and showed that the system represents a case of stable chaos in which , however , close encounters between planets are avoided .",
    "all of these models indicate clearly that the system is dynamically stable over long time scales ( @xmath30 0.1 gyr ) .    3 .  _",
    "apparent 3:1 mean ",
    "motion resonance_. the apparent 3:1 mean  motion resonance between the orbits of planets b and c in 55 cnc was initially hailed as a new example of a low  order commensurability in a `` resonant system '' ( barnes & quinn 2004 ) , with 2:1 resonances providing the only previous example in observed systems .",
    "although barnes & quinn ( 2004 ) did not study 55 cnc explicitly , their models showed that planets in resonant systems have very narrow zones of stability and raised the possibility that such systems are only marginally stable .",
    "modeling of 55 cnc was undertaken by zhou et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who showed that planets b and c can be captured in a 3:1 resonance if they start with modest eccentricities ( @xmath31 ) and migrate slowly ( for @xmath190.1  myr ) .",
    "the above models would indicate that the arrangement of the inner planets in 55 cnc is the result of special circumstances , an uncomfortable notion . since we now know that planets b and c are not in resonance ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ; gayon et al .",
    "2008 ) , a more palatable conjecture is that no special migration has ever occurred in 55 cnc and that its inner planets form a typical `` interacting system '' ( barnes & quinn 2004 ) in which the planets are able to perturb one another and have broad zones of stability available to them .",
    "modeling efforts and related conjectures concerning the apparent 3:1 resonance in 55 cnc demonstrate how difficult it is to simulate such complex systems because we do not have a handle on the initial conditions ; numerical models that start from arbitrary but convenient initial conditions are capable of producing `` easily '' just about all of the observed results .",
    "so it is not surprising that more recent modeling efforts ( although they did not address 55 cnc directly ) now seem to provide evidence against 3:1 resonant captures of planets in general : pierens & nelson ( 2008 ) found that massive planets captured by a dominant , jupiter  size planet tend to end up exclusively in 2:1 or 3:2 mean  motion resonances , depending on their mass . furthermore , adams et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and lecoanet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that turbulence in the host protoplanetary disk can upset mean  motion resonances and thus resonant systems should be rarely observed .",
    "_ packed planetary systems hypothesis_. the orbital stability calculations of barnes & quinn ( 2004 ) and related simulations by barnes & raymond ( 2004 ) used massless test  particles in models of several known extrasolar multiplanetary systems in order to identify broad regions full of dynamically stable orbits and to predict the possible existence of additional , yet unseen planets .",
    "these calculations were extended by raymond & barnes ( 2005 ) , raymond et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and barnes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to include various saturn  mass and terrestrial  mass particles in  between the orbits of the known planets in each simulated system .",
    "although it was easy to find stable orbits for additional planets with terrestrial or smaller masses in some of these systems , the main result of these numerical experiments came as a surprise : many systems are on the edge of stability and small changes to the values of @xmath32 or @xmath33 push them to become unstable .",
    "following the ideas of laskar ( 1996 ) , barnes & raymond ( 2004 ) conjectured that the remaining apparently stable systems are also packed with enough planets to be marginally stable .",
    "this is the packed planetary systems ( pps ) hypothesis and it predicts that stable systems may contain unseen planets that bring them to the edge of stability .",
    "the pps models successfully predicted the existence of hd 74156 d ( barnes et al .",
    "2008 ) before its discovery ( bean et al . 2008 ) and proved to be consistent with the presence of 55 cnc f that was found ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) orbiting at the inner edge of the predicted stable zone ( @xmath34  au @xmath35 3.2  au , @xmath36 ; barnes & raymond 2004 ) .",
    "the stable zone in 55 cnc is too wide , as a result the 5planet system is still not packed and there could be more undetected planets between the planets f and d ( raymond et al . 2008 ) . specifically , the pps models suggest the following interesting possibilities : ( a )  a giant planet with up to saturn mass may exist near 2  au ( the center of the stable zone ) with @xmath37 ( raymond & barnes 2005 ) .",
    "( b )  alternatively , several terrestrial planets with up to 0.63 earth masses may exist at 1.13.6  au with @xmath38 ( raymond et al .",
    "although the possibility of having earth  like planets in the `` habitable zone '' around 1  au is intriguing , our own interest in this work is focused entirely on the possibility of having a gas giant orbiting at @xmath192  au for the reasons that we explain in   [ newmodel ] below .",
    "the current observations of 55 cnc do not rule out such a planet : at a distance of @xmath192  au , a giant planet could avoid detection if its minimum mass is smaller than 100 earth masses ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) , i.e. , approximately equal to or less than the mass of saturn .    5 .  _ empirical titius  bode relation_. poveda & lara ( 2008 ) presented an exponential fit of the semimajor axes of the 5 known planets in 55 cnc .",
    "this empirical relation is akin to the titius ",
    "bode ( tb ) rule for the solar system , but it works only if there exists a hypothetical sixth planet at @xmath39  au . based on this result , poveda & lara ( 2008 ) proposed that an unseen planet with @xmath40  au should be present in 55 cnc .",
    "there is no physical basis for this prediction , yet it is quite interesting that the empirical tb relation of 55 cnc is in complete agreement with the prediction of the pps model for a gas giant at the same orbital distance .",
    "since the pps model and the tb relation converge to the same prediction , they can both be tested by additional doppler  shift measurements of the primary star of 55 cnc . by extending their baseline",
    ", future observations should be able to search for an additional periodicity in the 5  au gap of 55 cnc and , irrespective of the outcome , the result can be pivotal for planet formation theories ( see also   [ newmodel].5 ) .",
    "6 .  _ the protoplanetary disk of 55 cnc_. fischer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) made an attempt to estimate some key parameters of the minimum  mass protoplanetary disk of 55 cnc . using a typical surface density profile for the disk that varied with distance @xmath0 as @xmath1 and an estimate of the core masses of the 5 observed planets that took into account the excessive metallicity of the system",
    ", they found a total mass of 0.031 @xmath41 out to 6  au and a surface density for the dust of @xmath42 at 5  au .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio was set to the nominal value of 1% and the mass estimate also took into account the intermediate inclination of the orbital plane of the system ( @xmath43 , as derived by mcarthur et al .",
    "[ 2004 ] for 55 cnc d ) .",
    "the assumed @xmath44 profile was first established for the minimum  mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) by weidenschilling ( 1977 ) and hayashi ( 1981 ) and it has been commonly used ever since in calculations of this type .",
    "recently , this profile was investigated again in our solar system ( davis 2005 ) , in extrasolar systems ( kuchner 2004 ) , and in dusty circumstellar disks around t tauri stars ( kitamura et al .",
    "2002 ; andrews & williams 2007 ) . due to large systematic uncertainties ,",
    "none of these investigations has been able to directly confirm or reject the original @xmath44 relation , although all of them provide useful hints about possible improvements of the `` typical '' surface density profile of the solar nebula and extrasolar protoplanetary disks . for what follows , it is interesting to note that the the model of davis ( 2005 ) indicates that the original power ",
    "law @xmath45 with @xmath46 tends to overestimate the surface density within the central 1  au of the solar nebula .",
    "also , kuchner ( 2004 ) finds a steeper profile with @xmath47 for the surface density of the typical minimum  mass `` extrasolar nebula '' ( mmen ) constructed by weidenschilling s ( 1977 ) method from 26 exoplanets found in multi  planet systems . the @xmath47 power  law index results , again , in an overestimate of the surface density within the central 1  au of the mmen .",
    "the lack of a central core region , such as that suggested for the mmsn ( lissauer 1987 ; davis 2005 ) and for circumstellar disks ( garaud & lin 2007 ) , is the obvious reason for the excessive central densities in models that adopt a single power  law density profile for the entire protoplanetary disk .",
    "we are interested in 55 cnc because this is the only extrasolar system with so many planets in well  ordered , long  lived , circular orbits .",
    "we believe that the high degree of regularity seen in this system makes it an ideal laboratory for exploring the above  discussed issues and for testing the leading current hypotheses and models about planet formation in protostellar disks .",
    "our work starts with a new physical model that we formulated rigorously based on exact solutions of the isothermal lane ",
    "emden equation with rotation and that relates the observed planets in a well  ordered , multi  planet system to key physical properties of the protoplanetary disk that hosted their formation .",
    "first we applied this model successfully to the 11 largest planets of our solar system ( christodoulou & kazanas 2008 , hereafter ck ) and we proceed here to apply it to the 5 known planets of 55 cnc .",
    "the results obtained from our modeling are tied to the theoretical models of   [ th ] in the following ways :    1 .",
    "our model uses all the planets in regular orbits irrespective of size , mass , and metal abundances . as such",
    ", it works equally well for solar  type systems like our solar system and for systems with different metallicities or with gas giants in short  period orbits like 55 cnc .",
    "we do expect however that the modeling results will have to be interpreted consistently with the physical and the chemical properties of the detected planets and their parent stars .",
    "it is important that the planetary orbits of 55 cnc were found to be dynamically stable over long time scales because our model associates such long  lived orbits with local minima of the gravitational potential well in the midplane of the original protoplanetary disk .",
    "this association does not hold for many odd systems in which one or two planets have migrated inward and are now seen very close to their parent stars .",
    "however , the regular spacing of the planets and the stability of 55 cnc argue against migration as a process that dominated its evolution .",
    "it is now clear that 55 cnc b and c are not caught in a 3:1 mean  motion resonance .",
    "this result also suggests that no significant migration has taken place in the disk of 55 cnc and it supports our picture of a well - ordered system in which the planets formed in",
    " situ by core accretion . in turn ,",
    "such regular planetary orbits readily provide information about the locations of density enhancements ( the local potential minima ) in the disk during the planet formation stage .",
    "the pps models predict that there must exist at least one more planet in the 5  au gap of 55 cnc and they will be tested by future observations for the first time in such a well  ordered , multi  planet , extrasolar system . our model is also not impervious to the possible existence of an additional planet , but it does not necessarily need a 6@xmath48 planet in order to work . as it predicts entirely different physical characteristics for the disk of 55 cnc depending on whether 5 or 6 planets are used ( see   [ properties ] ) , our model too needs an observational resolution of this dilemma .",
    "5 .   based on the work of ck",
    ", we now understand that the tb relation can be accommodated within our approach , but the rule has no inherent physical significance for our solar system or for 55 cnc .",
    "since the tb relation of 55 cnc necessarily predicts a 6@xmath48 planet at @xmath40  au , the absence of such a planet from the 5  au gap will settle this issue without a doubt .",
    "such an observational result will however be detrimental to the pps hypothesis as well .",
    "alternatively , if an additional planet is found in the 5  au gap , then the doubts will persist , the pps hypothesis will persevere , and our model ( and presumably models such as those of weidenschilling [ 1977 ] and davis [ 2005 ] ) will then show a clear preference for a different radial density profile of the protoplanetary disk of 55 cnc ( see   [ properties ] for details ) .",
    "the attempt of fischer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to estimate some of the properties of the minimum  mass protoplanetary nebula ( mmpn ) of 55 cnc is noteworthy by insufficient .",
    "the main drawback of these estimates is that the authors assumed a @xmath49 profile for the disk without actually using weidenschilling s ( 1977 ) method or any of the competing methods cited in ",
    "[ th].6 above .",
    "consequently , the particular density profile produced by our disk model of 55 cnc can not be compared to this previous work . some of the parameter values obtained by fischer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and by kuchner ( 2004 ) , who did use weidenschilling s method , can however be compared to the results of our modeling , and we do so in   [ surface ] below .      in   [ model ] , we describe in detail the new physical model of the midplane of the protoplanetary disk of 55 cnc and we derive the fundamental dynamical parameters of this disk ( minimum mass , density profile , specific angular momentum , rotation frequency , and equation of state ) .",
    "we also examine the dynamical stability of the model and we describe the effects that a possible 6@xmath48 planet will have if it is discovered orbiting at @xmath40  au , as expected by the pps and tb models of the system (   [ th ] ) .    in   [ discussion ] , we interpret the results from our model and we discuss the issues and the questions mentioned above that pertain to the impressive regular structure of this planetary system and its intriguing 5  au gap .",
    "we also report briefly on our modeling effort of the related multi ",

    "returning now to the questions posed in",
    "  [ obs ] , we can outline some feasible answers suggested by the above results : most of the observed stars ( @xmath1990% ) do not show any giant planets at all . some of them , especially those of solar type , may have planetary systems formed in large light disks ( llds ) , in which case their planets are not observable yet with the current resolution because the inner planets have very low masses and the outer planets are too distant from their stars .",
    "this is probably the reason why the solar system is currently the only example of a system formed in an lld . on the other hand ,",
    "the inner giant planets formed in small heavy disks ( shds ) can be presently detected .",
    "besides the standard example of 55 cnc , all other planets found within 23  au from their stars in nearly circular orbits are good candidates for the shd mode .",
    "this also includes @xmath25 ara , hd  37124 , and the massive , short  period ( @xmath21 days ) planets with low eccentricities found in multiple stellar systems ( see   [ obs ] ) .    on the question of in  situ formation versus migration , the slow rotation found in our models ( table  4 ) and the structure of the disks that show several local potential minima strongly support the in  situ formation of planets by planitesimal aggregation and gas accretion inside these potential wells .",
    "this does not mean that planetary migration can not occur at all , it just indicates that the multiple planets of well  ordered systems do not migrate .",
    "migration may still be the dominant mechanism in systems with planets in highly eccentric and/or irregularly spaced orbits .",
    "but even in such cases , our modeling adds a new dimension to the migration problem that has not been previously explored : the ability of a planet to migrate can no longer be determined solely by the disk torques that redistribute the angular momentum of a planetary orbit . that was done in the past ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "[ 2000 ] , ward & hahn [ 2000 ] , and references therein ) while the density profile of the underlying disk was assumed to be monotonically decreasing without any localized potential wells . in the present",
    "setting in which the planets are trapped inside gravitational potential minima , the energy content of each planet needs to be considered as well .",
    "a planet orbiting inside a local gravitational potential well can migrate only if the interaction with the disk provides enough energy for it to leap out of its well  otherwise the torqing of the planetary orbit will simply lead to stable oscillations and the development of some eccentricity insde this potential minimum .    on the question of the existence of additional planets in 55 cnc",
    ", our model boldly predicts that no other planet will be found in the future .",
    "in particular , we do not believe that there is room in the 5  au gap even for a small rocky terrestrial planet or an asteroid belt because the potential minima of planets f and d reach into the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and all debris must have been swept by these two massive planets .",
    "this prediction is in contrast to the predictions of the pps models ( raymond et al .",
    "2008 ) and the tb conjecture ( poveda & lara 2008 ) for the system , and the disagreement can be resolved by future observations of 55 cnc ( see also   [ properties ] above ) .",
    "the question of the impressive growth of inner planet 55 cnc b ( @xmath14  au , mass @xmath192 jupiter masses ) was discussed briefly in   [ modes ] above .",
    "the density of the peak where this planet was formed ( table  2 ) is quite high ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "only planet e was formed in a higher  density environment in the shd of 55 cnc , but this planet resides deep inside the core of the nebula and its gaseous envelope could have easily been ablated by the protostar at a later time .",
    "the situation is similar in the inner solar system , although venus is slightly less massive than the earth .",
    "the emerging paradigm , valid for both llds and shds , is that of a depleted innermost planet followed by planets that are free to grow as much as the local conditions in the disk would allow .",

    "the presence of a roughly uniform core is strongly suggested by both theory and observations ( see   [ th].6 ) , and our models suggest that llds and shds can be distinguished by their core sizes ( @xmath191  au and @xmath190.05  au , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we do not know why both of the nebular disks in table  3 show the @xmath178 trend , although this fact  that we independently obtained the same result ( as opposed to two different power laws ) from two different planetary systems  argues in favor of our modeling assumptions .    at this point",
    ", we do not have any more evidence of the ubiquity of the @xmath178 profile among llds and shds , but we can certainly argue that this density power law is more relevant to planet formation than the profiles from steady  state viscous and irradiated accretion disks ( kitamura et al . [",
    "2002 ] , andrews & williams [ 2007 ] , garaud & lin [ 2007 ] , and references therein ) .",
    "the isothermal phase of protostellar collapse that our models address is an extended intermediate phase of the whole process during which the magnetic fields have diffused away , the central core mass is a minute fraction of the solar mass , matter continues being deposited onto the disk from above and below , most of the gas in the disk is molecular , and all the energy produced is efficiently radiated away ( see tohline [ 2002 ] for a recent review ) . at this stage ,",
    "the evolution of the gas is not driven by viscosity or by ionization because the gas is transparent to radiation ; the gas responds fully to the effects of self  gravity and ( non  keplerian ) rotation , and this is why it is very encouraging to know that our modeled disks are dynamically stable (   [ stability ] )",
    ". theoretical calculations of viscous , magnetized , or irradiated accretion disks are not applicable in this regime of protostellar collapse , while observations of thermal radiation from t tauri stars probe the disks long after the isothermal phase is over , the gas has become opaque to its own radiation , and the grown protostars have imposed nearly keplerian rotation profiles onto the disks . therefore , there is no reason to expect that the surface density profiles should have power ",
    "law indices of @xmath195 or softer ( seen in t tauri disks ; kitamura et al .",
    "2002 ; andrews & williams 2007 ) during the isothermal phase of collapse ; and if the planetary results of kuchner ( 2004 ) give any indication about extrasolar systems , we should expect instead @xmath196indices between @xmath165 and @xmath197 .",

    "<S> five planets are presently believed to orbit the primary star of 55 cnc , but there exists a large 5 au gap in their distribution between the two outermost planets . </S>",
    "<S> this gap has attracted considerable interest because it may contain one or more lower  mass planets whose existence is not contradicted by long - term orbit stability analyses , in fact it is expected according to the `` packed planetary systems '' hypothesis and an empirical titius  </S>",
    "<S> bode relation recently proposed for 55 cnc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the second largest planet is just the second farthest and it orbits very close to the star . </S>",
    "<S> its orbit , the most circular of all , appears to be nearly but not quite commensurable with the orbit of the third planet , casting doubt that any migration or resonant capture of the inner planets has ever occurred and lending support to the idea of `` in  situ '' giant planet formation by the process of core accretion . </S>",
    "<S> all of the above ideas will be tested in the coming years in this natural laboratory as more observations will become available . </S>",
    "<S> this opportunity presents itself in conjunction with a physical model that relates the orbits of the observed planets to the structure of the original protoplanetary disk that harbored their formation at the early stages of protostellar collapse . using only the 5 observed planets of 55 cnc </S>",
    "<S> , this model predicts that the surface density profile of its protoplanetary disk varied with distance @xmath0 precisely as @xmath1 , as was also found for the minimum  mass solar nebula . despite this similarity , </S>",
    "<S> the disk of 55 cnc was smaller , heavier , and less rotationally supported than the solar nebula , so this system represents a different mode of multi  planet formation compared to our own solar system . </S>"
