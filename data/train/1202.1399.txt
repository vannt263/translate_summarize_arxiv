    "in a recent paper , ( see @xcite , @xcite ) we investigated the asymptotic behaviour of a whittle - like approximate maximum likelihood procedure for the estimation of the spectral parameters ( e.g. , the _ spectral index _ ) of isotropic gaussian random fields defined on the unit sphere @xmath0 under gaussianity , it was indeed possible to establish consistency and a central limit theorem allowing for feasible inference , under broad conditions on the behaviour of the angular power spectrum .",
    "these results , as many others concerning statistical inference on spherical random fields , have recently found strong motivations arising from applications , especially in a cosmological framework ( see for instance marpecbook and the references therein ) . from the technical point of view , the asymptotic framework is rather different from usual , as it is based on observations collected at higher and higher frequencies on a fixed - domain ( the unit sphere ) : even consistency of the angular power - spectrum estimator under such circumstances becomes non - trivial , and largely open for research , see also @xcite .",
    "the procedure considered in @xcite is based upon spherical harmonics and classical fourier analysis on the sphere . despite its appealing properties",
    ", it must be stressed that in many practical circumstances spherical harmonics may suffer serious drawbacks , due to their lack of localization in real space .",
    "this can make their implementation unfeasible , due to the presence of unobserved regions on the sphere ( as it is commonly the case for cosmological applications ) , and it may exclude the possibility of separate estimation on different hemispheres , as considered for instance by bkmpber , @xcite . in view of these issues , it is natural to investigate the possibility to extend whittle - like procedures to a spherical wavelet framework , so to exploit the double - localization properties ( in real and harmonic space ) of such constructions .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper , where we shall focus in particular on spherical needlets .",
    "spherical needlets are a form of second - generation wavelets on the sphere , introduced in 2006 by @xcite and @xcite , and very extensively exploited both in the statistical literature and for astrophysical applications in the last few years .",
    "stochastic properties of needlets when used to estimate spherical random fields are developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite and mayeli .",
    "needlets have been generalized either to an unbounded support in the frequency domain ( mexican needlets ) by @xcite , @xcite and gm3 , and to the case of spin fiber bundles ( spin needlets , see gelmar , and mixed needlets @xcite ) , again in view of cosmological applications such as weak gravitational lensing and the so - called polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . concerning the latter , applications to cmb temperature and",
    "polarization data are presented for instance by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , fay08 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , pietrobon2 , @xcite .",
    "indeed , as described for instance in dode2004 and @xcite , satellite missions such _ wmap _ and _ planck _ ( see http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) are providing huge datasets on cmb , usually assumed to be a realization of an isotropic , gaussian spherical random field .",
    "parameter estimation has been considered by many applied papers ( see @xcite for a review ) , but in our knowledge until now no rigorous asymptotic result has so far been produced on these procedures .",
    "we refer also to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , pietrobon1 , @xcite for further theoretical and applied results on angular power spectrum estimation , in a purely nonparametric setting , and to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , leonenko1 , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further results on statistical inference for spherical random fields or wavelets applied to cmb .    as mentioned earlier , the asymptotic framework we are considering here is rather different from usual : we assume we are observing a single realization of an isotropic field , the asymptotics being with respect to the higher and higher resolution level data becoming available . in view of this",
    ", our paper is to some extent related to the growing area of fixed - domain asymptotics ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) ; on the other hand , as for @xcite some of the techniques exploited here are close to those adopted by @xcite , where semiparametric estimates of the long memory parameter for covariance stationary processes are analyzed . in terms of angular power spectrum behaviour , we shall also indeed for semiparametric models where only the high - frequency / small - scale behaviour of the random field is constrained .",
    "in particular , we consider both full - band and narrow - band estimates , the latter entailing a slower rate of convergence but allowing for unbiased estimation under more general circumstances .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ subsec : gaussrandomfiels ] , we will recall briefly some well - known background material on needlet analysis for spherical isotropic random fields ; in section [ sec : needwhittle ] we will introduce and motivate the whittle - like minimum contrast estimators , while in section asconsistency we shall establish the asymptotic consistency results .",
    "asymptotic gaussianity is considered in section [ clt ] , while in section [ narrow ] we present results on narrow band estimates .",
    "some monte carlo evidence on performance and comparisons with the procedures in @xcite are collected in section [ numerical ] , while some auxiliary technical results are collected in the appendix .",
    "it is a well - known fact in fourier analysis that the set of spherical harmonics @xmath1 represents an orthonormal basis for the space @xmath2 , the class of square - integrable functions on the unit sphere ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for more details , and @xcite , @xcite for extensions ) .",
    "spherical harmonics are defined as the eigenfunctions of the spherical laplacian @xmath3 e.g. @xmath4 , see again steinweiss , @xcite and @xcite for more discussion and analytic expressions .",
    "the spherical needlets ( @xcite , @xcite ) are defined as @xmath5where @xmath6 is a set of cubature points on the sphere , indexed by @xmath7 , the resolution level index , and @xmath8 , the cardinality of the point over the fixed resolution level , while @xmath9 is the weight associated to any @xmath10 ( see also e.g. @xcite ) and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the number of cubature points for a given level @xmath7 ; as discussed by ( @xcite , @xcite ) , cubature points and weights can be chosen to satisfy @xmath12where by @xmath13 , we mean that there exists @xmath14 such that @xmath15 . in the sequel , for notational simplicity",
    "we shall assume that there exists a positive constant @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for all scales @xmath7 .",
    "in practice , cubature points and weights can be identified with those evaluated by common packages such as healpix ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "viewing @xmath18 as a projection operator , ( [ need - def ] ) can be considered a weighted convolution with a weight function @xmath19 chosen so that the following properties holds ( see @xcite , @xcite ) : for fixed @xmath20 , @xmath21 has compact support in @xmath22 $ ] and therefore @xmath23 has compact support in @xmath24 $ ] ; this implies that needlets have compact support in the harmonic domain .",
    "moreover , @xmath25 , which will be pivotal to prove the following quasi - exponential localization property ( see @xcite ) : for any @xmath26 there exists @xmath27 such that for any @xmath28 , @xmath29finally , we have the so - called _ partition of unity _ property : for @xmath30@xmath31which allows to establish the following reconstruction formula ( see again @xcite ) : for @xmath32 , we have , in the @xmath33 sense : @xmath34where@xmath35    consider now a zero - mean , isotropic gaussian random fields @xmath36 ; we recall also that for every @xmath37 and @xmath28 , a field @xmath38 is isotropic if and only if@xmath39where the equality holds in the sense of processes .",
    "it is again a standard fact ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that the following spectral representation holds : @xmath40note that this equality holds in both @xmath41 and @xmath42 senses for every fixed @xmath28 . for an isotropic gaussian field ,",
    "the spherical harmonics coefficients @xmath43 are gaussian complex random variables such that@xmath44where the angular power spectrum @xmath45 fully characterizes the dependence structure under gaussianity .",
    "characterizations of the spherical harmonics coefficients under gaussianity and isotropy are discussed for instance by @xcite , @xcite ; here we simply recall that : @xmath46hence , given a realization of the random field , an estimator of the angular power spectrum can be defined as:@xmath47the so - called empirical angular power spectrum .",
    "it is immediately observed that@xmath48    now recall that the needlet coefficients can be written as@xmath49where@xmath50as in @xcite , we introduce the following regularity condition on the angular power spectrum :    [ regulneed0]the random field @xmath51 is gaussian and isotropic with angular power spectrum such that:@xmath52where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , for all @xmath55 , and for every @xmath56 there exist @xmath57 such that:@xmath58for @xmath59 .    condition [ regulneed0 ] requires some form of regular variation on the tail behaviour of the angular power spectrum @xmath60 . for instance , in the cmb framework the so - called _ sachs - wolfe _ power spectrum ( i.e. the leading model for fluctuations of the primordial gravitational potential ) takes the form ( [ cl - reg ] ) , the spectral index @xmath61 capturing the scale invariance properties of the field itself ( @xmath62 is expected to be close to @xmath63 from theoretical considerations , a prediction so far in good agreement with observations , see for instance @xcite and larson ) . in particular , this condition will be necessary to prove needlet coefficients ( [ needcoeffic ] ) to be asymptotically uncorrelated  ( see @xcite ) . for asymptotic results below , we shall need to strengthen condition [ regulneed0 ] as in @xcite , imposing in particular    [ regulneed ] condition [ regulneed0 ] holds , and moreover @xmath64whence @xmath65    as we shall show , condition [ regulneed ] is sufficient to establish consistency for estimator we are going to define .",
    "we shall also consider two further assumptions , [ regulneed2 ] ( which implies [ regulneed ] ) , to derive asymptotic gaussianity , and [ regulneed3 ] ( which implies regulneed2 ) to provide a centered limiting distribution , see also dlm for related assumptions .",
    "[ regulneed2 ] condition [ regulneed0 ] holds and moreover@xmath66    [ regulneed3 ] condition [ regulneed0 ] holds and moreover @xmath67    condition [ regulneed0 ] is satisfied for instance by@xmath68where@xmath69are two finite order polynomials such that @xmath70 .",
    "condition [ regulneed2 ] is then fulfilled for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , while condition [ regulneed3 ] holds for @xmath73 ( see also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .    under condition",
    "[ regulneed0 ] we have:@xmath74    indeed@xmath75@xmath76more details can be found the appendix , proposition [ propkj ] .    as mentioned before , in @xcite it is proven , in view of ( boundden ) ,",
    "that :    [ lemmacor]under condition [ regulneed0 ] , there exists @xmath77 such that : @xmath78    as a direct consequence of this lemma , needlets coefficients at any finite distance are asymptotically uncorrelated , and hence asymptotically independent in the gaussian case .",
    "following ( [ needcoeff ] ) and @xcite , we have easily that:@xmath79where , by equation ( [ powest2 ] ) :    @xmath80    the following lemma provides the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath81 .",
    "[ gavarini ] under condition [ cl - reg ] , we have@xmath82and@xmath83where@xmath84    for the sake of notational simplicity , in the sequel we shall write @xmath85 ( omitting the dependence on @xmath86 whenever this does not entail any risk of confusion .",
    "simple calculations based on ( [ powest2 ] ) lead to : @xmath87and , for @xmath88,@xmath89@xmath90@xmath91    finally , we have:@xmath92@xmath93and , if @xmath94 @xmath95while if @xmath96@xmath97as claimed .",
    "our aim in this section is to discuss heuristically a needlet whittle - like approximation for the log - likelihood of isotropic spherical gaussian fields , and to derive the corresponding estimator .",
    "we start from the assumption that needlet coefficients can be evaluated exactly , i.e. without observational or numerical error , up to resolution level @xmath98 .",
    "this is clearly a simplified picture , analogous to what we assumed in @xcite for the case of spherical harmonic coefficients ; however in the wavelet case the assumption can be considered much more realistic .",
    "indeed , it is shown for instance in @xcite that the effect of masked or unobserved regions is asymptotically negligible , in view of the localization properties of the needlet transform .",
    "hence we believe our results provide a useful guidance also for realistic experimental situations .",
    "needless to say , the maximal observed scale @xmath98 grows larger and larger when more sophisticated experiments are undertaken : indeed @xmath98 is a monotonically increasing function of the maximal observed multipole @xmath99 .",
    "the latter is for instance in the order of 500/600 for data collected from @xmath100 and 1500/2000 for those from @xmath101 . in terms of our following discussion , it is harmless to envisage that @xmath102 . the analysis of frequency - domain approximate maximum likelihood estimators based on spherical harmonics is described in @xcite , while narrow - band , wavelet - based maximum likelihood estimators over @xmath103 can be found in @xcite .    to motivate heuristically our objective function , consider the vector of coefficients@xmath104under the hypothesis of isotropy and gaussianity for @xmath105 , we have that @xmath106 , where@xmath107 _ { k , k^{\\prime } } = \\sqrt{\\lambda _ { jk}\\lambda _ { jk^{\\prime } } } % \\sum_{l}b^{2}\\left ( \\frac{l}{b^{j}}\\right ) \\frac{\\left ( 2l+1\\right ) } { 4\\pi } % c_{l}p_{l}\\left ( \\left\\langle \\xi _ { jk},\\xi _ { jk\\prime } \\right\\rangle \\right ) \\text { .}\\]]in view of lemma [ lemmacor ] and equation ( [ njdef ] ) , it is to some extent natural to consider the approximation @xmath108where @xmath109 denotes the @xmath110 identity matrix .",
    "we stress , however , that the present argument is merely heuristic - indeed , for instance , elements on the first diagonal do not converge to zero .",
    "the approximation however motivates the introduction of the pseudo - likelihood function:@xmath111and the corresponding log - likelihood as:@xmath112@xmath113 \\text { , } \\]]up to an additive constant .",
    "the full ( pseudo-)likelihood is obtained by combining together all scales @xmath7 , so that@xmath114@xmath115 \\text{.}\\]]let us now introduce the following :    [ kfunctions]for @xmath116 , define the function @xmath117with derivatives @xmath118 given by@xmath119    our objective function will hence be written compactly as : @xmath120 \\\\ & = & \\sum_{j=1}^{j_{l}}\\left [ \\frac{1}{g}\\frac{\\sum_{k}\\beta _ { jk}^{2}}{% k_{j}\\left ( \\alpha \\right ) } + n_{j}\\log g-\\sum_{k}\\log \\left ( \\frac{\\beta _ { jk}^{2}}{k_{j}\\left ( \\alpha \\right ) } \\right ) \\right ] \\text { .}\\end{aligned}\\]]more precisely , in view of condition [ regulneed ] and the discussion in the previous section , the following definition seems rather natural :    the _ needlet spherical whittle estimator _ for the parameters @xmath121 is provided by@xmath122    to ensure that the estimator exists , as usual we shall assume throughout this paper that the parameter space is a compact subset of @xmath123 more precisely we take @xmath124 , $ ] @xmath125 and @xmath126 , $ ] @xmath127 this is little more than a formal requirement that is standard in the literature on ( pseudo-)maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "we can rewrite in a more transparent form the previous estimator following an argument analogous to @xcite , i.e. concentrating out  the parameter @xmath128 .",
    "indeed , the previous minimization problem is equivalent to consider@xmath129it is readily seen that:@xmath130\\]]@xmath131and because @xmath132 \\text{,}\\]]we obtain@xmath133 \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{j_{l}}n_{j}}{\\widehat{g}\\left ( \\alpha \\right ) ^{2}}>0% \\text { .}\\end{aligned}\\]]hence @xmath134 maximizes @xmath135 for any given value of @xmath62 .",
