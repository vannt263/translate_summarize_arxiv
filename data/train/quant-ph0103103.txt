    "as is known @xcite there is no fringe shift in evacuated michelson interferometer .",
    "thus , this mode of the device is not fit to detect  aether wind  .",
    "michelson interferometer becomes sensitive to  aether wind  when using in it as light s carrier an optical medium with refractive index @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if light passes always in a single medium the interference fringe shift @xmath11 appears to be proportional to square of the velocity @xmath8 of the interferometer relative to aether : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . here",
    "the allowance for lorentz contraction of the interferometer s longitudinal arm is vital .",
    "below i report results of the experiment on michelson interferometer configured in such a way that light runs consecutively via two different optical media @xmath1 it goes at first through one medium and then returns back through other medium . in this case",
    "the fringe shift proves to be proportional to @xmath7 where @xmath13 .",
    "so , the two - media - mode device is more sensible to  aether wind  . besides , in the interferometer of the first order the contribution of relativistic factor into the fringe shift , being quadratic with respect to @xmath7 , can be neglected as small quantity",
    "the device in question is a common rotary cross - like interferometer ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "light firstly splits by the half - transparent plate into two orthogonal beams .",
    "further each beam goes to rebounding mirrors through the optical medium having dielectric permittivity @xmath3 and then returns in the medium having dielectric permittivity @xmath4 .",
    "media are separated in space by minor displacement of return containers .",
    "the respective shear of light s beams is secured by means of two mirrors .",
    "thus , returning rays meet in the point laying at another semi - transparent plate that is angled at @xmath14 just as the splitting plate .",
    "the space separation from the incoming beam of the light outgoing to the interference screen ( 1 on fig.[fig1 ] ) brings down parasitic noise as compared with usual construction of the second order interferometer .",
    "next , collected on the plate 1 ( fig.1 ) rays are projected by the telescopic objective 2 on the screen of the vidicon 3 and then transmitted by the tv camera on the screen of the kinescope 7 .",
    "interferometer ( 1971 year ) .",
    "light issuing from the source @xmath15 splits at the semi - transparent plate and then goes consecutively through two glass tubes filled with light s carriers of respective dielectric permittivity @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "ends of the tubes are covered by thin glass lids . after reflecting from rebounding mirrors the light returns for interference at the other half - transparent plate .",
    "1 is the interference screen , 2 telescopic ocular , 3 vidicon with a deflecting facility , 4 and 5 are feeding and video cords passing via the tube 6 in the center of rotation , 8 is the interference pattern at the screen of the kinescope 7 . ]",
    "the interference fringe shift is proportional to difference @xmath16 of round - trip times according to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bandwidth and @xmath19 the wavelength . by virtue of ( [ fringe shift ] ) we may reason in terms of time intervals @xmath20 .",
    "the speed of light @xmath21 in the moving with velocity @xmath22 optical medium is given by fresnel formula @xmath23 as measured in the reference frame of the moving medium . here",
    "@xmath24 is the refractive index and @xmath25 the contribution of particles into the dielectric permittivity @xmath26 of the optical medium .    from ( [ fresnel ] )",
    "we have for the round - trip time @xmath27 in the direction of interferometer arm parallel to @xmath8 @xmath28\\label{time parallel}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the dielectric permittivity of the forward medium , and @xmath4 that of the return medium . in deriving ( [ time parallel ] ) terms with @xmath29",
    "were discarded .",
    "we have for the round - trip time in the orthogonal direction @xmath30 where again terms with @xmath29 were neglected .",
    "subtracting ( [ time parallel ] ) from ( [ time perpendicular ] ) gives @xmath31 formula ( [ time difference ] ) shows that the difference of round - trip times depends on the difference of the contribution of particles into dielectric permittivities of two light carrying media .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the measured amplitude @xmath32 of the harmonic component of the interference fringe shift as a function of local time @xmath33 at the attitude of obninsk .",
    "measurements covered 24 hours of the day and night .",
    "the light s carriers were : in the forward direction carbon bisulfide ( cs@xmath34 ) @xmath35 , and on the return path the air at normal pressure , @xmath36 .",
    "the right scale of ordinates shows values of the aether wind velocity @xmath37 km / s .",
    "the dependence @xmath38 agrees well with that obtained on the interferometer of second order with respect to @xmath0 @xcite .    according to ( [ time difference ] )",
    "the first order device is @xmath39 times more sensitive than the interferometer of the second order with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "this enabled me to use a relatively small arms @xmath40 m.     at various times of day and night , local time at obninsk 55.8@xmath41 nl , 22 june 1971 year , where @xmath11 is the amplitude of interference fringe shift and @xmath42 mm is the bandwidth on the kinescope s screen .",
    "light s carriers are cs@xmath34 having @xmath43 and air having @xmath44 .",
    "the line width shows the jitter noise @xmath45 of the interferometer .",
    "the horizontal projection @xmath46 of the aether wind velocity , computed from @xmath32 by ( [ time difference ] ) with ( [ fringe shift ] ) is shown at the right ordinate axis .",
    "parameters of the experiment : arms are @xmath47 m , wavelength @xmath48 m. ]    fig.[fig3 ] shows the dependence of the interference fringe shift @xmath11 on the difference @xmath6 between dielectric permittivities of light s carriers .",
    "as we see , @xmath11 linearly grows from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . by ( [ time difference ] )",
    "the sensitivity can be enhanced in @xmath51 times ( 100 times due to @xmath6 and 1000 times due to @xmath0 ) . so that the measuring can be performed at microwaves , i.e. @xmath51 times greater wavelengths than in optics .",
    "the microwave experiment was made using the catio@xmath52 ferroelectric guide , @xmath53 , at @xmath54 cm by the direct measurement of the phase difference .",
    "the converted to @xmath11 magnitude lies exactly on the continuation of the line 1 in fig.[fig3 ] @xcite .     of the interference fringe as a function of difference @xmath6 between dielectric permittivities of two light s carriers : @xmath55 air ( @xmath56)/lab vacuum ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 cs@xmath34 ( @xmath59)/air , @xmath60 plexiglas ( @xmath61)/air .",
    "abscissa and ordinate scales are logarithmic .",
    "line 1 corresponds to @xmath62 , line 2 to @xmath63 in notations of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "@xmath64 is the jitter noise read on the screen of kinescope .",
    "parameters of the experiment for cs@xmath34 : arms are @xmath47 m , wavelength @xmath65 ( all other data are reduced to this values ) ]",
    "thus the reality of the first order with respect to @xmath0 michelson interferometer is experimentally demonstrated .",
    "experiments show that the shift of the interference fringe occurs in optical media and is absent in vacuum .",
    "the first order interferometer is @xmath39 times more sensitive to aether wind than the second order michelson interferometer .",
    "the first order interferometer shows the ratio signal / noise @xmath66 all round the clock .",
    "such the resolving power and stability of measurements at any time of day and night and any season attests confidently the presence of the absolute reference frame with the earth moving relative to it with the velocity that is above 480 km / s .",
    "earlier the same estimation of the  aether wind ",
    "velocity has been obtained on michelson interferometer by two methods @xcite operating at second order effects with respect to @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "it was the historically first method that took into account parameters of optical medium specially used as a light s carrier .",
    "the content presented here is actually a third method of experimental measuring the velocity of  aether wind  via the shift of interference fringe at the transverse beams interferometer @xmath1 the method operating at first order effects with respect to @xmath67 due to use of two optical media as light s carriers .",
    "thus , kinetic evidences for existence of luminiferous aether are to this time provided by three phase interferometry techniques , two operating at second order effects and third one , described in the present report , at the first order one .",
