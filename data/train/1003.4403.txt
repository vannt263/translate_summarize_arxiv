    "stochastic processes are used to model a great variety of systems in disciplines as disparate as physics @xcite , genomics @xcite , finance @xcite , climatology @xcite and social sciences @xcite .",
    "among others , markov processes play a central role in the modeling of natural phenomena due to their simplicity .",
    "in fact , a markov process is fully determined by the knowledge of its probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath6 and its conditional transition probability @xmath7 .",
    "when a stationary markovian process is continuous both in space and time , the time evolution of these distributions is described by a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will only consider stationary markovian processes that can be described by using a fp equation .",
    "stochastic processes can be considered from the point of view of their correlation properties . under this respect ,",
    "random variables are divided in short - range and long - range correlated variables .",
    "short - range correlated variables are characterized by a finite mean of time - scales of the process whereas a similar mean time - scale does not exist for long - range correlated variables @xcite .",
    "several stationary markovian processes are short - range correlated . in fact",
    ", the paradigmatic stationary markovian process is the ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) one @xcite , whose autocorrelation function is the exponential function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time - scale of the process .",
    "however , generally speaking a stationary markovian process can be multi - scale , i.e. it may admit either a discrete or a continuum set of time - scales @xcite . in general , the autocovariance function @xmath10 of an additive stationary markovian process admitting a fokker  planck equation can be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13\\lambda_c,+\\infty[$ ] ( @xmath14 ) constitute the discrete and continuum parts of the eigenvalue spectrum of the fp equation .",
    "the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath16 are appropriate weights computed in terms of the eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "this picture indicates that the more time - scales included in the process , the slower the decay of the autocorrelation function . a generalization to non additive processes that are obtained by performing",
    "appropriate coordinate transformations of the additive ones has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main interest is to investigate what are the determinants of a long - range correlated stationary markovian process , at the level of its probability distributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered stationary markovian stochastic processes with a power - law decaying autocorrelation function and a stationary pdf with gaussian or exponential tails .",
    "those results suggested that the stationary pdf does not bear any special feature with respect to the correlation properties of the process .",
    "we therefore want to investigate how the inclusion of more and more time - scales into stationary markovian stochastic processes affects their conditional probability , which is the other probability distribution that fully characterizes the process .    to this end",
    "we will consider two stationary markovian processes with gaussian pdf and autocorrelation function not described by a single exponential . in one case",
    "the process is short  range correlated and in the other case the autocorrelation function decays like a power - law . we preliminarily show that , as suggested by the doob theorem @xcite , this is only possible if one admits a conditional probability different from gaussian for both processes .",
    "we then investigate the conditional probability by following two complementary approaches .",
    "first we consider the conditional probability at equal spatial positions @xmath2 as a proxy of how persistent is a process in a given position .",
    "we show that the higher the number of time - scales incorporated in the stochastic process the higher the persistence . we then consider a quantity related to the conditional probability , i.e. the mean first passage time @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it can be considered as a proxy of how fast is the process in reaching a position at distance @xmath5 from the initial position @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the higher the number of time - scales incorporated in the stochastic process the slower the process is .",
    "on the other hand , for small values of @xmath5 , the more time - scales the process includes , the smaller the mean first passage time , i.e. when a process statistically spends more time in a given position the likelihood that it reached nearby positions by chance is also enhanced .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ gauss ] we will show two examples of processes that are gaussian distributed and whose autocorrelation function is not exponential . in one case , see section [ riskgaussall ] , the process is short - range correlated . in the second case ,",
    "see section [ chigaussall ] , the process can be long - range correlated with an appropriate choice of the relevant parameters . in any case the process is always power - law correlated .",
    "in section [ gausspersistence ] we consider the conditional probability at equal spatial position @xmath2 and show that it decays like a power - law decays for the algebraically correlated process . we also show that such peculiar behaviour is not shared by other processes that include an infinite and unbounded set of time - scales . in section [ gausspropagator ]",
    "we consider the mean first passage time @xmath17 and show that the higher the number of time - scales incorporated in the stochastic process the slower the process is .",

    "one can show that in the limit when @xmath164 : @xmath196 and therefore the large time behaviour of @xmath197 is : @xmath198 the above result shows that the mere existence of an infinite and unbounded set of timescales is not enough to ensure an asymptotic power - law behaviour in @xmath197 .",

    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that the power - law decay of @xmath154 can be observed for all values of @xmath114 , i.e. when the process is either short - range and long - range power - law correlated .",
    "however , when the process is long - range correlated , the integral @xmath237 diverges .",

    "this indicates that , starting from position @xmath187 , locations that are very distant are reached with increasing difficulty .",
    "that raises the problem of the effective capacity of a power - law correlated process to span all the real axis in a finite time .",
    "surprisingly , for small values of @xmath5 , at least for some choices of the relevant parameters , processes that include more time - scales show a smaller mean first passage time .",
