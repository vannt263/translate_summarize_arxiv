    "despite several successes of the standard big bang cosmology based on friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , still a series of problems to be resolved like the horizon problem , flatness problem , dark matter ( or missing mass ) problem , structure formation , topological defects , matter - antimatter asymmetry and the cosmic coincidence problem etc .",
    "most of these are related with the cosmic past of the observable universe while the cosmic coincidence problem has its origin in the recent time since it naively asks why certain cosmological phenomena are occurring in our presence or in our times .",
    "recent astrophysical observations give convincing evidence of an accelerating universe caused by dark energy characterized by the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is yet unknown why the present energy density of the dark energy is approximately equal to that of dust - like matter .",
    "it is termed as the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite . till",
    "now several models have been proposed in an attempt to solve this problem such as the ` tracker field ' @xcite , oscillating dark energy @xcite and the variable constants approach @xcite , to name a few .",
    "it appears that the energy density of the radiation component is also almost equivalent to that of the matter and the dark energy i.e. @xmath1 or @xmath2 , the so - called ` cosmic triple coincidence problem ' @xcite .",
    "the question is : why this happens in the current or in recent times .",
    "the history of the parameter @xmath3 suggests that it is no more a constant but possesses a parametric form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the redshift parameter .",
    "thus in the past @xmath6 corresponds to radiation and then @xmath7 for matter .",
    "later it evolved to quintessence @xmath8 to cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
    "this behavior suggests that in future , @xmath3 will be super - negative i.e. @xmath10 , which corresponds to the phantom energy .",
    "thus in totality , we have the transition from @xmath11 to @xmath10 the so - called ` phantom crossing ' or ` phantom divide ' scenario , while we are observing @xmath9 at the current time @xcite .",
    "the coincidence problem in this context is rephrased as ` why is @xmath9 now ? '    in recent years , the usual coincidence problem is addressed by proposing an exotic interaction between dark energy and matter in which energy from @xmath12 is diluted or decayed into the @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it is recently proposed that if these two components interact then some energy might dissipate into a third component @xmath14 which is as yet hypothetical @xcite .",
    "the third component can be known form of matter or an altogether exotic fluid in which case some new physics will be required to explain the interaction .",
    "if we assume @xmath15 then the interaction between three fluids i.e. matter , radiation and dark energy will be quite interesting .",
    "it is well - known that matter and radiation were decoupled at the time of emission of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation at a redshift @xmath16 .",
    "thus both matter and radiation are almost non - interacting components but it can be anticipated that these two components do supposedly interact with the dark energy . thus if dark energy and matter interact , the energy dissipated in the interaction is assumed to transfer to the radiation component and vice versa for the radiation and the dark energy interaction .",
    "this dynamic interaction than hugely alters the effective equation of state of the three interacting fluids .",
    "our analysis in this paper suggests that effective eos of the three fluids will be interlinked to each other considerably and also constrained by coupling parameters .",
    "moreover , the interaction naturally leads to the phantom crossing scenario .    we here present a model in which three cosmic fluids ( radiation , matter and dark energy )",
    "interact with each other with equal degree of freedom .",
    "hence there are three coupling parameters involved which can take arbitrary positive or negative values not all zero simultaneously .",
    "the positive and negative values correspond to back and forth nature of energy exchange between the fluids .",
    "we emphasis here that the coupling parameters in our model are only constrained by the choices of effective eos of the fluids .",
    "thus in our model , exact eos of the fluids like in the non - interacting frw model is not possible . as the exact eos for",
    "the dark energy is unknown , its interaction with other fluids creates ambiguities in the determination of the exact eos of the other fluids .",
    "hence we also stress that precise values of the eos s can be deduced only empirically from the phenomenology of the interacting fluids .",
    "we start by assuming the background to be spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic frw spacetime @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the scale factor .",
    "we consider three fluids having the equations of state ( eos ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding pressures and the energy densities of the fluids , respectively .",
    "also @xmath23 are the dimensionless eos parameters . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume the three fluids to be perfect fluid - like since in general , interaction between fluids might lead to local inhomogeneities , which are ignored in the present paper .",
    "the equations governing the interaction of three fluids are expressed as @xmath24 here @xmath25 are the energy exchange ( or dissipative ) terms to be put ad hoc in the above equations .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath25 should be determined only from the phenomenological and empirical results . however , from dimensional considerations , the quantity @xmath25 should have dimensions of density into the time inverse . choosing the later one to be hubble parameter , we notice that @xmath25 can be of the following forms : @xmath26 .",
    "this approximation can be saturated to equality by inserting a dimensionless parameter ( say @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus we can write @xcite ( see @xcite for more exotic expressions for @xmath25 ) @xmath28 in the last expression , @xmath27 are the coupling constants which can take positive or negative values to yield two - sided energy exchange rather than one - sided . also eqs .",

    "these coupling constants are expressed in terms of the equation of state parameters @xmath23 .",
    "we here stress that the exact nature of the interaction is largely unknown i.e. the mediating particles of the interaction are not yet identified .",
    "any interacting dark energy model should , in principle , be motivated from the particle physics or the corresponding phenomenology , however there are as yet no sound theoretical models which could identify the particle interactions .",
    "there are some arguments that the phantom - like dark energy can decay into at least one ordinary particle and some other phantom - like particles @xcite .",
    "to perform stability analysis , we write eqs .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) as @xmath75 here we have used the constraint equations on the coupling parameters by : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . since the above system is autonomous i.e. there is no explicit time dependent term in the equations , we can analyze the system by first finding its critical points and later on , checking the stability of the system about those points . a critical point ( also called fixed point )",
    "is the one that satisfies the dynamical system ( like eqs . 2 - 5 ) when equated to zero .",
    "similarly , a critical point becomes an attractor if the solution of the system converges to that point for large values of the time parameter .",
    "such kind of analysis is generally performed to check whether the dynamical system possesses any solution which is stable against small perturbations @xcite .",
    "further , defining the dimensionless density parameters as @xmath79 using eqs .",
    "( 41 - 43 ) , we can rewrite eqs ( 38 - 40 ) as @xmath80 above the time derivative has been replaced with the differentiation with respect to a new parameter @xmath81 .",
    "this parameter corresponds to the number of e - foldings which is convenient to use for the dynamics of dark energy . by equating above three equations to zero",
    ", we obtain the critical points ( see below ) .",
    "to find whether the system approaches to any critical point , we check the stability about these points , by producing small perturbations @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 around the critical point @xmath85 i.e. @xmath86 now in order to linearize our dynamical system , we take the @xmath87 variation of the above equations ( 44 - 46 ) and evaluate them at the critical points @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is an indexing parameter : @xmath90 we then next construct a matrix consisting of the coefficients of the perturbation parameters and compute the eigenvalues of that matrix .",
    "the stability of the critical points depends on the nature of the corresponding eigenvalues and it leads to three specific cases : if the real parts of all the eigenvalues are negative , then the following critical point is a stable node ; if the real parts of the eigenvalues are all positive , then that critical point is an unstable node , in all other cases , the critical points will be saddle points . in our analysis , we shall be interested in only those critical points that yield stable nodes .    in order to obtain some physical interpretation of our results",
    ", we assign dust ( or matter ) , radiation and dark energy with subscripts @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "thus the corresponding eos parameters take values @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 or @xmath96 depending whether it is quintessence or cosmological constant . from here",
    "onwards , we divide our dynamical system ( 44 - 46 ) into two parts : one for @xmath97 and other for @xmath95 .",
    "it is not possible to obtain the critical points of the full system ( 44 - 46 ) .",
    "the only way out is by choosing at least one parameter @xmath27 to be zero . in the next sections",
    ", we shall use only two coupling parameters while taking the third one to be zero .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath98 implies that radiation and dark energy are mutually non - interacting while there are interactions between dark energy and matter and between matter and radiation .",
    "similar interpretations can be made when choosing either @xmath99 or @xmath100 to be zero .",
    "note that the following critical points are obtained by setting @xmath101      the dynamical system yields the following critical points @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 now we substitute above critical points in eqs .",
    "( 38 - 40 ) and obtain eigenvalues . since analytical expressions for the eigenvalues",
    "are not possible , so we shall resort to estimate the numerical values of eigenvalues for specific choices of coupling parameters . fixing @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( both positive ) , @xmath104 and @xmath106",
    "( one positive ) and @xmath107 and @xmath106 ( both negative ) no stable node is obtained from the above critical points . however , for @xmath107 and @xmath105 , the first critical point @xmath108 becomes a stable node .",
    "@xmath109    for all the choices of @xmath99 and @xmath100 as adopted in the previous subsection , no critical point arises as a stable node .",
    "setting @xmath110 , we obtain the following critical points :      @xmath111    for @xmath112 and @xmath106 , the stable node arises at second critical point @xmath113 . for other values of @xmath114 and @xmath100 , no other stable node arises .",
    "@xmath115    here for @xmath112 and @xmath106 , the stable node arises at second critical point @xmath116 .",
    "now we perform similar analysis for @xmath117 , we get the critical points      @xmath118    among the above critical points , the only stable node is produced for the first one for values @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    ".      @xmath121    among the above critical points , the only stable node is produced for the first one for values @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    in figures 1 - 6",
    ", we provide the schematic representation of triple interacting fluids , taking two at a time , with various choices of the coupling parameters and initial conditions .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen arbitrarily but these must satisfy the constraint @xmath122 ( the friedmann equation ) . in figures 1 and 4 , we assume first and second interacting fluids whereas in figures 2 and 5 and 3 and 6 , we assume second and third and first and third interacting fluids respectively .",
    "the three solutions @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 always satisfy the constraint @xmath122 .",
    "in this paper , we have attempted to resolve the cosmic triple coincidence problem which naively asks why the energy densities of the three major ingredients of the cosmic composition namely matter , radiation and dark energy are of same order at current time .",
    "rephrasing , why @xmath3 has evolved to @xmath96 in recent times .",
    "we here point out that the eos @xmath126 used in this paper is not , in general , a true eos for any cosmic fluid .",
    "rather it is a phenomenological relationship suitable for the configuration .",
    "the actual eos may not be that simple and may have dependencies on various other cosmological parameters like redshift , time , hubble parameter and its derivatives etc @xcite .",
    "however to a first order approximation , it may be taken for such analysis .",
    "further , the standard non - interacting frw model can not resolve the coincidence problem since it predicts a hierarchial system in which radiation density decreases faster compared to matter , while density of dark energy remains either constant ( if it is cosmological constant ) or increases ( if it is phantom energy ) . therefore it contradicts with the observations where all the three components have equivalent densities .",
    "model of interacting dark energy , which is a modification of the frw model , has enormous potential to explain this cosmological conundrum .",
    "it naturally predicts that if the cosmic fluids interact with each other , it leads to a scenario compatible with the observations @xcite .",
    "we have found that in the interacting fluid model , the three fluids can achieve super - negative equation of state .",
