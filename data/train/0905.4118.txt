    "the study of non - tangential convergence of harmonic functions began in 1906 with p.  fatou @xcite .",
    "he states that a positive harmonic function on the unit disc of @xmath0 admits at almost all point of the unit circle a non - tangential limit .",
    "it is true in a lot of general cases like euclidean half - spaces , trees ( @xcite ) , free groups ( @xcite ) , riemannian manifolds of pinched negative curvature ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and gromov hyperbolic graphs ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus natural to study cases where the harmonic function is not necessarily positive .",

    "calderon and e.m .  stein ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) proved that for a harmonic function @xmath2 , the three following properties are equivalent for almost all point @xmath3 of the boundary :    * the function @xmath2 is non - tangentially convergent at @xmath3 * the function @xmath2 is non - tangentially bounded at @xmath3 * the area integral @xmath4 is finite ( for all @xmath5 where @xmath5 is a non - tangential cone ) .    by probabilistic methods ,",
    "j.  brossard proved the same result in 1978 @xcite .",
    "a.  koranyi remarked that hyperbolic spaces provide a more natural setting for this study .",
    "indeed , several notions have simpler expressions in this case : the boundary becomes an ideal one , non - tangential cones become tubular neighbourhoods of geodesic rays ... following this remark , f.  mouton proved an analogous result for harmonic functions on riemannian manifolds of pinched negative curvature @xcite , and for harmonic functions on trees @xcite .",
    "we prove here a partial analogue for non - elementary hyperbolic groups : for a harmonic function ( the notion of harmonicity is here relative to a random walk on a cayley s graph of the hyperbolic group ) , non - tangential convergence is almost everywhere equivalent to non - tangential boundedness .",
    "we introduce in section  2 the notions of random walks and harmonic functions in hyperbolic groups and in section  3 the boundary at infinity , which enables to state our main result in section  4 .",
    "the section  5 is devoted to the conditioning of the random walk to exit at a fixed point of the boundary and to the proof of a stochastic result . in order to prove the non - tangential convergence criterion , we state geometric lemmas in section  6 .",
