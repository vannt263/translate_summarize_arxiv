    "it has been one of the long standing goals of theories of particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) to predict quark and lepton masses and mixing . with the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing",
    ", this quest has received a massive impetus .",
    "indeed , perhaps the greatest advance in particle physics over the past decade has been the measurement of neutrino masses and mixing involving two large mixings associated with atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation experiments , while the remaining mixing , although unmeasured , is constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation experiments to be relatively small .",
    "the largeness of the two large lepton mixings contrasts sharply with the smallness of quark mixing , and this observation , together with the smallness of neutrino masses , provides new and tantalising clues in the search for the origin of quark and lepton flavour .",
    "it turns out that the observed neutrino oscillation parameters are consistent with a tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing structure @xcite : @xmath7   \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : hps}\\ ] ] it has been observed that this simple form might be a hint of an underlying family symmetry @xmath8 , which preserves certain group transformations ( corresponding to the generators @xmath9 , as discussed later ) which are respected by tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , and several models have been constructed that account for this structure of leptonic mixing @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend the underlying family symmetry to provide a description of the complete fermionic structure @xcite , in which , in contrast to the neutrinos , the quarks have a strongly hierarchical structure with small mixing .",
    "a desirable feature of a complete model of quark and lepton masses and mixing is that it should be consistent with an underlying grand unified theory ( gut ) structure , either at the field theory level or at the level of the superstring .",
    "the most ambitious @xmath10  gut models which have been built to achieve this are based on an underlying @xmath2 type gut structure .",
    "this is very constraining because it requires that all the 16 spinor components of a single family should have the same family charge , comprising the left - handed fermions @xmath11 and the cp conjugates of the right - handed fermions @xmath12 , including the right - handed neutrino .",
    "we emphasise that it is very desirable that the right - handed neutrinos should be unified with the rest of the quarks and leptons , since this feature leads unavoidably to neutrino masses . by contrast , in @xmath13 right - handed neutrinos are gauge singlets without which it is natural to have zero neutrino masses .",
    "although it seems somewhat _ ad hoc _ to add right - handed neutrino singlets to @xmath13 , once they are present it is straightforward to construct models of lepton masses and tb mixing that are consistent with quark masses and mixing , and there are several successful models of this kind  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth remembering that in such models the right - handed neutrinos must be added by hand as an optional extra and therefore neutrino mass is not strictly a prediction of @xmath13 whereas in @xmath2 neutrino mass is unavoidable since the right - handed neutrinos are unified with the rest of the quarks and leptons , leading to the prediction of three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in fact similar comments apply to any partially unified model in which @xmath14 is gauged , for example pati - salam ; also a gauged @xmath15 predicts right - handed neutrinos due to anomaly considerations .    despite the theoretical attractiveness of a @xmath16 gut structure of the form @xmath17",
    ", there are very few models in this class that are capable of predicting , or more accurately postdicting , tb mixing .",
    "as we shall discuss later , in order to obtain tb mixing naturally ( i.e. enforced by a symmetry ) one requires a group with a non - abelian structure containing triplet representations , together with a particular set of discrete group elements which embody the symmetry properties of the tb mixing matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hps ] ) .",
    "there is also an additional theoretical requirement in @xmath2 that the family symmetry must contain complex triplet representations as discussed below",
    ". examples of such models based on the pati - salam subgroup of @xmath2 have been constructed where the family group @xmath18 is @xmath19 @xcite or @xmath20 @xcite . in such models",
    "all 16 components of a single family including the left - handed fermions @xmath11 and the cp conjugates of the right - handed fermions @xmath12 are assigned to the complex triplet representation of @xmath21 or @xmath20 , namely @xmath22 .",
    "flavon anti - triplets @xmath23 are introduced to break @xmath8 , and the lowest dimension yukawa operators consistent with an @xmath21 family symmetry are then , |^i^_i|^j_j^ch  , [ yuk_op ] where @xmath24 is the higgs field which is generally taken to be a singlet @xmath25 under @xmath8 . for discrete family symmetries like @xmath20 additional contractions may in principle become possible , however , in concrete models they are usually assumed to be suppressed or absent . if a particular flavon @xmath26 has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) aligned along the third direction @xmath27 , then this operator would imply a yukawa matrix which is suitable for describing the large third family yukawa coupling , @xmath28    on the other hand , if the triplet representations were taken to be real rather than complex then this would allow an undesirable alternative @xmath29 invariant contraction of the indices in the yukawa operator in eq .",
    "( [ yuk_op ] ) , arising from the fact that for real triplets @xmath30 contains a singlet @xmath31 ( whereas for complex representations it does not ) , namely @xmath32 leading to a yukawa matrix proportional to the unit matrix which would tend to destroy any hierarchies in the yukawa matrix . for real representations ,",
    "there is no symmetry at the effective operator level that could forbid such a trivial contraction of the two triplet fermion fields , together with the trivial contraction of the two triplet flavon fields .",
    "however in principle it is possible to appeal to the details of the underlying theory responsible for generating this operator in order to forbid the trivial contraction , which would involve a discussion of the heavy messenger states whose exchange generates the operator , though we shall not pursue this possibility further here .    alternatively , there is the possibility of obtaining a yukawa operator from a single triplet flavon field , @xmath33 , using @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is some tensor contraction .",
    "for example if the fields are triplets of @xmath36 or @xmath29 , then we can have @xmath37 , the totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "however such operators can not generate the diagonal elements of the yukawa matrix . for discrete groups such as @xmath38 the tensor @xmath35",
    "can additionally be chosen totally symmetric .",
    "depending on the basis of the triplet representation , it may however still be impossible to generate the diagonal elements of the yukawa matrix ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in typical models of this kind based on @xmath39 , the singlet contraction @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an @xmath38 singlet , are typically invoked to obtain the diagonal elements , and the problem of achieving a hierarchical yukawa matrix is challenging @xcite .",
    "the above considerations seem to point towards a @xmath42 theory , where @xmath18 is @xmath19 @xcite or @xmath20 @xcite since these groups contain complex triplet representations .",
    "however there is one undesirable feature of such theories , namely that the top yukawa coupling must necessarily originate from a higher order operator involving two flavon fields , as in eqs .",
    "( [ yuk_op ] ) and ( [ yuk ] ) .",
    "this implies that the flavon vev must be quite close in magnitude to the mass scale of the operator leading to a convergence problem , since the effective top quark yukawa coupling @xmath43 is typically about 0.5 at the gut scale in susy models , which implies that @xmath44 , or @xmath45 .",
    "we emphasise that this problem is unavoidable in @xmath42 models unless the higgs fields carry @xmath18 quantum numbers which would allow renormalisable yukawa couplings , but such theories face the challenge of flavour changing neutral currents .",
    "there is a further problem arising from anti - triplet flavons in the explicit @xmath19 @xcite or @xmath20 @xcite models .",
    "it is related to the origin of the top and bottom quark yukawa coupling due to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagrams](@xmath46 ) which is mediated by @xmath47 singlet messengers @xmath48 which are supposed to be lighter than @xmath47 doublet messengers and hence give the dominant contribution to the effective yukawa operator .",
    "[ diagrams](@xmath46 ) involves anti - triplet flavons @xmath49 and is mediated by heavy fermionic messengers @xmath48 of two types namely @xmath50 and @xmath51 with mass @xmath52 and @xmath53 , corresponding to the diagrams involving up and down quark cp conjugated right - handed fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "similar diagrams for the first and second family quarks require a messenger hierarchy in the up and down yukawa sectors , @xmath56 , which is necessary to account for the two different expansion parameters in the two sectors , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 refers to the first and second flavons .",
    "this must be corrected for in the third family to achieve @xmath60 .",
    "this is done in a rather cumbersome way by assigning the third family flavon @xmath26 to be a combination of a singlet plus a triplet of @xmath14 , and adjusting the flavon vevs to lead to @xmath60 @xcite , where the larger values of these yukawa couplings is achieved by assuming larger third family flavon vevs @xmath61 , as discussed previously .",
    "it is possible to alleviate both the above problems by invoking ( anti-)sextet flavon fields as the origin of the third family yukawa couplings .",
    "for example , introducing a two index anti - sextet of @xmath21 , @xmath62 , which is symmetric under interchange of @xmath63 , the lowest order yukawa operators become , ^ij^_i_j^ch  .",
    "[ yuk_op2 ] if the anti - sextet flavon @xmath64 has a vev aligned along the 33 direction @xmath65 , then this operator would imply a yukawa matrix of the form @xmath66 with the top quark yukawa coupling of 0.5 implying @xmath67 , which has somewhat improved convergence properties .",
    "in addition , unlike in @xcite , it is sufficient to assume that the third family flavon @xmath64 is a singlet of @xmath14 since the messengers will be qualitatively different in the case of the third family due to the fact that @xmath64 is a flavon anti - sextet rather than an anti - triplet , as we now discuss .    according to the above discussion it is plausible to assume that the operators responsible for the third family yukawa couplings involve ( anti-)sextet flavons and are generated from diagrams involving messengers @xmath68 which carry higgs quantum numbers as well as being ( anti-)sextets , see fig .",
    "[ diagrams](@xmath69 ) .",
    ", the messengers @xmath48 are @xmath47 singlets ; with ( anti-)sextet flavons , case  ( @xmath69 ) , the messengers are @xmath47 doublets .",
    "[ diagrams],width=472 ]    such higgs messengers would imply similar mass scales for the top and bottom yukawa operators , naturally and elegantly leading to top - bottom unification , with the ( anti-)sextet flavons being @xmath2 singlets .",
    "the operators for the first and second family quarks could then continue to involve anti - triplet flavons , with the relevant operators , given in @xcite , arising from diagrams involving heavy fermionic messengers @xmath48 of mass @xmath52 and @xmath53 , similar to fig .",
    "[ diagrams](@xmath46 ) .",
    "the above discussion provides a good motivation for considering flavon ( anti-)sextets as the origin of the third family yukawa couplings in @xmath17 models .",
    "although this is possible in the case where the family group @xmath18 is @xmath19 @xcite , it is not possible for the @xmath20 @xcite models for the simple reason that @xmath20 does not admit ( anti-)sextet representations . on the other hand ,",
    "discrete family symmetry groups have been shown to be preferred to continuous family symmetry groups such as @xmath19 .",
    "the reason is that , starting from a discrete symmetry group which contains a finite number of group elements , it is easier to achieve vacuum alignments which preserve the subgroup elements @xmath9 required for tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , rather than starting from a continuous group which contains an infinite number of group elements .",
    "the question then naturally arises of whether there is a discrete subgroup of @xmath19 which admits triplet representations , to which we can assign the three families of quarks and leptons , together with ( anti-)sextet representations suitable for accommodating the flavons responsible for the third family yukawa couplings .",
    "we further require the triplet representations to be complex , to forbid the singlet contraction @xmath40 , but the ( anti-)sextet representation is allowed to be real or complex . the smallest discrete group consistent with these requirements is @xmath70 , which is the projective special linear group of two dimensional matrices over the finite galois field of seven elements .",
    "@xmath70 contains 168 elements and is also known as @xmath71 @xcite . for practical purposes ,",
    "the most important features of @xmath70 are that it admits complex triplet and anti - triplet representations as well as a ( real ) sextet .",
    "@xmath70 is a subgroup of @xmath36 , and contains @xmath5 as a maximal subgroup .",
    "by contrast , @xmath20 is also a subgroup of @xmath36 but is not a subgroup of @xmath70 , and does not contain @xmath5 as a subgroup . the relationship of @xmath70 to some other family symmetries that have been used in the literature is discussed in @xcite and depicted in fig .  [ family ] . from a mathematical point of view",
    "@xmath70 is the unique finite group that is both _",
    "simple _ and contains complex triplet representations .. being a subgroup of @xmath29 , its two triplets are real which gives rise to the trivial bilinear invariant .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is not a subgroup of @xmath72 so that tri - bimaximal mixing can not be obtained naturally ; instead the solar mixing may be related to the golden ratio  @xcite . ]     and its relation to some other subgroups of @xmath36 .",
    "a line connecting two groups indicates that the smaller is a subgroup of the bigger one .",

    "however , for physical applications , it is desirable to be able to relate the representations of @xmath70 to those of @xmath5 in a basis in which the generators of @xmath5 are denoted as @xmath4 where @xmath9 are the symmetry transformations of the tri - bimaximal neutrino mass matrix in the diagonal charged lepton mass basis .",

    "the typical lagrangian ( or superpotential ) of interest generically consists of two parts , the yukawa sector and the majorana sector .",

    "when the higgs develop their vevs , and @xmath11 are identified with left - handed lepton fields @xmath82 , while @xmath83 are identified with charged conjugated right - handed charged leptons such as @xmath84 , the effective yukawa operators lead to the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath85 , while the effective majorana operators lead to a neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath86 .    in the flavour basis ,",
    "in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and the tb mixing arises from the neutrino sector , the effective neutrino mass matrix , denoted by @xmath87 , may be diagonalised as , @xmath88 given @xmath89 , this enables @xmath87 to be determined in terms of the three neutrino masses , @xmath90 where the three matrices are @xmath91 from above we may write @xmath87 as the symmetric matrix , @xmath92 where ,",

    "the resolution to this problem is intrinsically related to the origin of the yukawa couplings .",
    "if the yukawa couplings are generated by the vevs of flavon fields , as is generically the case for models which respect a family symmetry , then it is possible to have different symmetries in the yukawa and majorana sectors , providing different flavons appear , or are dominant , in the two sectors .",
    "the idea is that the complete high energy theory lagrangian , including both @xmath96 and @xmath99 , would both respect some family symmetry @xmath18 due to the presence of flavons of two types @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath103 appears in @xmath105 but not in @xmath99 , where only @xmath104 appears . in other words the effective yukawa sector is supposed to originate from terms of the form , ^yuk = ^_i_ij^yuk_j^ch  , [ opyuk-1 ] while the effective majorana sector comes from terms like ^maj = ^_i_ij^maj^_jhh  , [ opmaj-1 ] where both terms are invariant under @xmath18 , with the indices @xmath106 now being regarded as indices of @xmath18 .",
    "generically @xmath103 and @xmath104 may represent either a single flavon or a polynomial of flavons of a particular type .",
