    "since the discovery of electroluminescence ( el ) in poly(p - phenylene vinylene ) ppv,@xcite considerable efforts have gone in development and commercialization of light - emitting diodes ( leds ) , based on luminescent conjugated polymers ( lcps ) . while much progress has been made in improving emission efficiency and color control,@xcite the detailed physics of charge transport and light generation in these materials is relatively poorly understood in comparison with inorganic semiconductors .",
    "the one - dimensional delocalization of electrons and substantial electron - hole and electron - lattice interactions render the delineation of neutral and charged excitations in lcps very complex and demanding .",
    "moreover , a dynamical description is needed in order to capture the transient relaxation processes that occur when charged species approach each other , recombine and decay .",
    "photogenerated singlet e - h pairs in lcps typically relax to highly emissive @xmath5 excitons prior to decay .",
    "in contrast , electroinjected electrons @xmath6 and holes @xmath7 are not spin correlated and can combine to form both singlet and triplet excitons .",
    "@xmath8 because the decay of the triplet exciton @xmath9 is nearly radiationless and relaxation to @xmath10 occurs via spin - orbit coupling , quantum efficiency in electroluminescence @xmath11 is only a fraction of that for photoluminescence @xmath12 .",
    "if the rate of e - h capture is spin - independent , @xmath13 and @xmath9 excitons are formed in a 1:3 ratio as dictated by spin degeneracy .",
    "in such a case , 75% of the bound e - h pairs are non - emissive leading to a theoretical maximum of @xmath14 .",
    "nonetheless , efficiencies of up to @xmath15 have been achieved independently on ppv - based leds in the laboratories of heeger@xcite and friend@xcite . from this",
    "it has been inferred that in organic light - emitting polymers , singlet @xmath16 capture is intrinsically more efficient than the respective triplet process @xmath17 .    if we assume that the formation kinetics is first order such that the singlet and triplet exciton population formation rates are proportional to the total population of charge - transfer ( ct ) states in the system , then the formation cross - section @xmath18for singlet excitons as given by the ratio of singlets to total excitons by @xmath19 where @xmath20 . in order to obtain the nearly 64% el efficiencies reported by various groups@xcite in various organic polymer led devices",
    ", @xmath21 must be in the range of @xmath22 .",
    "such ratios were also obtained for a wide range of organic lcps via photoabsorption / detection of magnetic resonance ( padmr ) experiments by wohlgenannt , _ at al _ @xcite which measures the population of photo - generated intrachain parallel and anti - parrallel polaron pairs in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this later work@xcite is particularly significant in that it establishes a universal linear scaling relationship between @xmath21 and inverse conjugation length , which holds for a wide range of lcp systems .",
    "various mechanisms favoring the formation of @xmath5 versus @xmath9 have been proposed for both interchain and intrachain e - h collisions . using fermi s golden rule , shuai ,",
    "bredas et al.@xcite indicate that the @xmath23 cross section for interchain recombination can be higher than the triplet one due to bond - charge correlations .",
    "et al._@xcite resort to a similar model of two parallel polyene chains . both of these works neglect vibronic and relaxation effects . in simulating the intrachain collision of opposite polarons , kobrak and bittner @xcite",
    "show that formation of @xmath5 is enhanced by the near - resonance with the free e - h pair .",
    "the result reflects the fact that spin - exchange renders @xmath9 more tightly bound than @xmath5,@xcite and hence more electronic energy must be dissipated by the phonons in the formation of the former .",
    "the energy - conservation constraints in spin - dependent e - h recombination have been analyzed by burin and ratner@xcite in an essential - state model .",
    "the authors point out that nonradiative processes ( internal conversion , intersystem crossing ) must entail c = c stretching vibrons since these modes couple most strongly to @xmath24 excitations .",
    "recent work by tandon et al .",
    "suggest that irrespective of the recombination process , interchain or intrachain , the direct transition to form singlets should always be easier than triplets due to its smaller binding energy relative to the triplet .",
    "lastly , a comprehensive review of this work detailing the experiments and summarizing the theory of this effect is forthcoming.@xcite    in this work , we describe e - h capture in lcps in terms of the dissipative dynamics of a multi - level electronic system coupled to a phonon bath .",
    "our model is based upon a two - band polymer model introduced by soos , mazumdar , _ et al _ @xcite augmented by the coupling of electronic excitations to a bath of vibrational modes .",
    "first , we review a time - dependent model for simulating via quantum chemical methods the transient relaxation dynamics of an excited state in an extended system.@xcite the methodology we develop herein is applicable to both excitonic transfer ( i.e. frster ) as well as charge - transfer states in a general conjugated polymer system . at the present , we restrict our attention to mono - excited closed - shell systems ; however , the approach can be extended to the general case for radicals .",
    "secondly , we examine a specific physical process involving the collision and relaxation of injected electron - hole pairs in luminescent conjugated polymers , such as ppv.@xcite our calculations underscore the role that vibronic coupling and electron - hole symmetry play in determining the singlet - triplet branching ratio as the ct state relaxes to form bound electron / hole excitonic pairs .",
    "finally , we explore the relation between chain length and the singlet / triple branching ratio .",
    "we show that our methodology reproduces the remarkably universal linear relation between conjugation length and @xmath21 as evident in a wide range of conjugated polymer materials . to our knowledge ,",
    "ours is the first molecular based model which accurately predicts this linear relation for a specific molecular system and provides a rationalization for this trend based upon the variation of the exchange energy with increasing chain length .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coupled system is @xmath25 the electronic hamiltonian @xmath26 represents the configuration interaction of localized singlet of triplet configurations @xmath27 with a valance hole in repeat unit @xmath28 and a conduction electron in repeat unit @xmath29 . for example , the @xmath30 geminate monoexcited configuration for a 6 repeat - unit system is @xmath31 where as @xmath32 represents a charge - transfer configuration .",
    "our notation is such that @xmath33 represents a neutral site in the ground - state configuration , @xmath34 denotes a site with a hole , @xmath35 a negatively charged site with an excess electron , and @xmath36 a neutral excitonic site .",
    "system specific information is incorporated by using valance and conduction band wannier functions ( wf ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the single particle basis . for the single - particle band - structure",
    "we use a hartree - forck pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) approximation which can be parameterized easily for a variety of luminescent conjugated polymer systems . and construct maximally optimized wannier functions .",
    "the single - particle terms , @xmath39 , are derived at the ground state equilibrium configuration , @xmath40 , from the fourier components @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the band energies in pseudomomentum space .",
    "@xmath43 for extended @xmath44-systems with electron - hole symmetry , the localized electron / hole energy levels and transfer parameters are related by @xmath45 and reflect the cosine - shaped valance and conduction bands of half - width @xmath46 and centered at @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the two - particle interactions are spin dependent with @xmath48 with @xmath49 with the exception of geminate wfs , orbital overlap is small such that the two - body interactions are limited to coulomb and exchange integrals reflecting e - h attraction and spin - exchange coupling non - geminate configurations such as @xmath50 and transition dipole - dipole integrals coupling only geminate singlet electron - hole pairs , @xmath51 in the absence of e - h symmetry , dipole - dipole coupling between singlet geminate and non - geminate configurations is introduced through this term . as we shall explore later in this paper , this opens a channel for coupling singlet charge - transfer states to singlet excitonic states but does not allow for coupling between the triplet ct to xt states .",
    "finally , the electron - phonon coupling term , @xmath52 describes the local variation of the single - particle band gap and is taken to be linear a set of phonon normal - mode coordinates @xmath53 which are localized within a single unit - cell .",
    "the linear coupling strength for both the electron and holes , @xmath54 , is adjusted empirically as to reproduce the the vibronic progressions observed in the single - photon absorption and emission spectra .",
    "correspondingly , the vibrational term , @xmath55 models weakly dispersec optical phonon branches in the frequency ranges of the dominant franck - condon active modes observed in the experimental spectra . for the case of ppv considered here , the phonon term consists of two sets of local harmonic oscillators with weak nearest - neighbor coupling , representing two dispersed optical phonon branches , centered at 1600 and 100@xmath56 , respectively .",
    "these frequencies roughly correspond to c = c bond stretches and ring - torsional motions ( librations ) , which dominate the franck - condon activity in ppv and related polymers.@xcite huang - rhys factors ( dimensionless el - ph coupling constants ) for @xmath5 of the isolated monomer were subsequently set to 0.8 for the high - frequency mode and 10 for the low - frequency mode .",
    "having set up the primitive hamiltonian and parameterized it according to a model physical system , we can obtain the diabatic electronic / vibrational structure by separately diagonalizing @xmath26 and @xmath55 yielding a series of vertical excited states with energies @xmath57 ( from @xmath40 ) and a normal modes with frequencies @xmath58 .",
    "written in the diabatic representation @xmath59 the diabatic coupling term @xmath60 is simply the original electron - phonon coupling tensor transformed into this new representation .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) for vertical singlet and triplet excitations from the ground state for a ppv model with 32 repeat units ( @xmath61 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ dos - ppv ] , as parameterized from the @xmath44-band structure and wannier functions of the extended polymer .",
    "although the stokes shifts from adiabatic relaxation of the excited states is missing in this calculation , the lowest singlet @xmath5 and triplet @xmath9 excitons differ significantly in terms of their binding energies . here",
    ", @xmath9 is roughly 1ev lower than the @xmath5 in general agreement with experimental and theoretical estimates .",
    "we can also use the diabatic representation to calculate the relaxed excited states and their respective potential energy curves .",
    "this we achieve by variational minimization of the adiabatic energy @xmath62 of each individual state according to @xmath63 the relaxed excited states are eigenstates of @xmath64 at state specific conformations , @xmath65 , displaced from the ground state at @xmath66",
    ". such displacements modify the optical spectra by moving states into and out of regions of strong franck - condon coupling to the ground state .",
    "@xcite thus , we can test the parameterization of the model by computing the condon spectral density for single photon absorption .",
    "the cumulative spectral density of @xmath61 is given in fig .",
    "[ spect ] for both the vertical and condon approximation .",
    "individual electron - vibrational transitions are taken to give lorentzian lineshapes of half - width 0.01ev .",
    "the oscillator strengths for the @xmath67 vertical transitions were computed by assuming that only geminate and nearest neighbor e - h pairs are dipole coupled to @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath5 is approximately and all - symmetric combination of such configurations , the bulk of the spectra density is concentrated in this state .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath68 vibronic band is peaked in the @xmath69 c = c stretching feature in agreement with the experimental spectra .",
    "vibronic structure from librations is smeared and produces spectral broadening proportional to huang - rhys factors times phonon frequencies .",
    "the low - frequency coupling also determines the @xmath70 0.15ev stokes shift of the @xmath71 c = c stretch feature from the adiabatic origin of @xmath5 at 2.34ev .        .",
    "absorption ( blue ) and red - shifted emission ( red ) spectra between the adiabatic ground state and the excited states and the black curve is the oscillator strength for vertical excitation from the ground state .",
    "spectral features correspond to excitation of c = c vibronic stretching modes in the excited state ( upon absorption ) and in the ground state ( upon emission ) as detailed in the inset figure . , width=576 ]      separated ct states are not eigenstates of the diabatic hamiltonian and will evolve in time according to the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "unfortunately , a complete description of the vibronic dynamics is unfeasible due to the enormous size of the state - space .",
    "however , we can consider the phonons as a dissipative finite - temperature bath for the electrons and derive reduced equations of motion for the electronic dynamics . for this",
    "we turn to the liouville - von neumann equation for the evolution of the electronic density matrix @xmath72 + \\frac{i}{\\hbar}{\\cal r}\\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term represents the unitary evolution of the uncoupled electronic states in the diabatic representation and the second term the non - unitary , dissipative dissipative dynamics due to the coupling to the phonon bath .",
    "since the electronic state - space consists of roughly 100 energy levels , we restrict our attention to the population dynamics and decouple populations from coherences according to the bloch model , @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the rates of elementary interstate transitions . for internal conversions within the diabatic excited states ,",
    "we assume that the phonons thermalize rapidly on the time - scale of the electronic dynamics such that the one - phonon transitions rates can be determined within the markov approximation @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the bose - einstein distribution of phonons at t = 300k and @xmath77 is the empirical broadening of 0.01ev .",
    "note that for an elementary @xmath78 population transfer to occur there must a phonon mode @xmath79 at that transition frequency @xmath80 .",
    "thus , phonon mediated dynamics is restricted to the excited state manifold where the energy level spacing is commensurate with the phonon energies .",
    "in contrast , single - photon processes occur across the @xmath81 optical gap and the rate of spontaneous emissions is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the transition dipoles of the excited singlets .",
    "these we can comput directly from the wannier functions or empirically from the photoluminescence decay rates for a given system .",
    "photon mediated transitions between excited states are highly unlikely due to the @xmath84 density factor of the optical field .",
    "in essence , so long as the non - equilibrium vibrational dynamics is not a decisive factor , we can use these equations to trace the relaxation of an electronic photo- or charge - transfer excitation from its creation to its decay including photon outflow measured as luminescence .",
    "in modeling of e - h capture , propagation starts from the free e - h pair represented by the charge - transfer ( ct ) configuration with an electron and a hole on the far ends of the polymer chain , for example : @xmath85 we considered chains with @xmath86 = 2,4 , 8 , 16 , and 32 repeat units corresponding to longer and longer polymer chains .",
    "the salient data from each of these calculations is presented in table  [ tab1 ] . in fig.[dos - ppv ] we show the diabatic density of states ( dos ) , and the spectral distribution of the starting configuration in s and t state - spaces for a 32 repeat unit chain @xmath87 .",
    "singlet and triplet populations are also given at an intermediate stage of relaxation at 100ps .",
    "in both cases , the system evolves to a metastable superposition state , where half of the density remains locked in ct states ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) above the lowest excitons ( @xmath0 or @xmath1).@xcite the branching into ct and xt channels is due to e - h symmetry , which separates excited states into even and odd representations under e - h transposition .",
    "thus , xt states , which are even , are not vibronically coupled to ct states , which are odd . as shown in fig.[rates]a , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are formed at different rates . whereas @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 show almost parallel population growths , formation of @xmath1 is far slower .",
    ".collected data for various chain lengths ( symmetric case ) . here ,",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 are the formation half - times ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the electro - luminescent efficiency . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     assuming that after an initial approach time , the formation of the lowest energy excitons follows first - order kinetics corresponding to the decay of some precurser state , we can fit the population data to an exponential form and obtain the formation rate constants . for the longest chain considered ( @xmath87 ) ,",
    "the formation half - times are @xmath93ps and @xmath94ps , i.e. , @xmath95 corresponding to a 77% el / pl efficiency , which is systematically higher than observed in both led@xcite and padmr@xcite data , but nevertheless consistent with the observed trend . for physical systems in",
    "which disorder limits the effective conjugation length , one might expect the effective conjugation length to be more on the order of 8 to 10 repeat units . for ppv",
    "this corresponds to @xmath96 which is more in line with the experimental observations .    the intrinsic distinction between s and t e - h captures is readily understood in terms of different exciton binding energies@xcite @xmath97 . as seen in fig.[dos - ppv ] , the singlet excitonic band @xmath0nearly overlaps with the charge - transfer band @xmath2 , whereas in the case of the triplet exciton",
    ", @xmath9 lies at the bottom of a separate band of bound e - h pairs , about 1.5ev below the ct continuum .",
    "thus @xmath1 formation requires on average a longer sequence of vibron - mediated transitions , each falling into the phonon frequency range .",
    "the higher efficiency of s recombination becomes more apparent when e - h symmetry is lifted .",
    "we slightly broaden the conduction band and squeeze the valence band , so that @xmath98 .",
    "the small e - h asymmetry changes negligibly the electronic spectrum , but opens a weak vibronic channel for ct@xmath4xt internal conversions .",
    "the resulting population dynamics are shown in fig.[rates]b . here",
    "we see a fast build - up of low - lying xt and ct states in the first 100 to 200ps , followed by a slow conversion of ct states into excitons .",
    "the initial dynamics occurs approximately without e - h parity crossovers and the formation rates of low - lying xt and ct singlets and triplets are about the same as in the symmetric case .",
    "however , the triplet xt to ct branching ratio decreases drastically to about 1:2 and suppresses the formation of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , subsequent @xmath99 relaxation is very slow due to the large binding energy of triplet excitons and the low density of states between @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath1 population reaches only 40% after 800ps propagation .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 is slightly favored over @xmath2 in the initial capture , and further @xmath100 conversion occurs on a time scale of about 800ps.@xcite    note as well that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are very close in energy because of the lack of appreciable exchange between separated electrons and holes .",
    "hence , intersystem @xmath101 crossing of long - lived ct states due to spin - orbit coupling ( not included in the present model ) is highly likely to occur prior to final e - h binding .",
    "let us consider the relaxation from the lowest unbound ( ct ) state to the lowest bound excitonic ( xt ) state due to coupling to the lattice vibrations . since the exciton binding energy is greater than energy for a single phonon transition , we need to think about this a multi - phonon process .",
    "if we assume that this occurs as a set of discrete hops of energy @xmath102 , then the binding energy is @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the hopping rate between adjacent vibronic levels is the same for all steps , then the population of a given vibronic sublevel is @xmath104 where we assume that downward transitions are favored over upward transitions . for systems at low temperature , this will be the case so long as @xmath105 .",
    "looking at the population of the state at the bottom , @xmath106 , which corresponds to the final excitonic state , we can easily solve these coupled kinetic equations @xmath107 now we ask , what is the time required for 1/2 of the initial population to appear in the lowest state starting from the highest ? not surprisingly , this scales with the number of intermediate states and consequently , the binding energy .",
    "thus , @xmath108 which is consistent with our simulations discussed above .    next , taking the singlet - triplet energy gaps into consideration .",
    "to a lowest order approximation the singlet - triplet energy difference is approximately equal to twice the electron / hole correlation energy @xmath109 . using the data in table 1",
    ", we can fit @xmath110 to a simple functional form @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath86 is the chain length .",
    "thus , @xmath115 finally , using @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117 since @xmath118 is twice the correlation energy of an electron / hole pair in an infinitely long chain , this we can assume that for organic polymers , its value is more or less system independent .",
    "this universality consistent with the experimental observations reported in ref.@xcite thus , we argue that the recombination process proceeds via a cascade through a series of intermediate states coupling the lowest charge - transfer states to the lowest excitonic state .     and the rate - constant ratios for singlet and triplet cases . b. singlet - triplet gap vs. @xmath119 .",
    "solid curve is fit to quadratic form.,width=384 ]",
    "in summary , we have simulated phonon - mediated intrachain e - h recombination in lcps .",
    "the approach allows us to examine el quantum yield in lcps further case by case by combining first - principle description with available spectroscopic data .",
    "while we focus here on ppv and adjust el - ph coupling to its absorption spectrum , results can be generalized to most nondegenerate polymers .",
    "apart from spin - degeneracy statistics , efficiency of singlet e - h capture outweighs the triplet one as a natural outcome of the higher binding energy of triplet excitons . for both s and t processes , the relaxation mechanism involves two steps as a result of approximate e - h symmetry . in the initial e - h capture",
    ", both low - lying excitons and same - spin ct intermediates are formed .",
    "the xt to ct branching ratio may vary , but is inevitably more favorable for singlet excitons than for triplet ones simply due to energetics . relaxing to the higher",
    "lying singlet exciton requires fewer elementary relaxation steps than the lower lying triplet exciton .",
    "subsequent conversion of ct states into excitons is forbidden by e - h symmetry and occurs on a much slower time scale once this symmetry is broken .",
    "the weak e - h asymmetry of real conjugated systems favors again the singlet @xmath120 relaxation by a factor , commensurate with the ratio of t to s exciton binding energies .",
    "what is desired is experimental detection of the transient kinetics we predict in out model .",
    "ideally , the experiment would monitor the fluorescence signal following electron - hole injection onto a polymer chain .",
    "this is an extremely experiment since electro - injection typically entails multiple polymer chains with disordered morphology .",
    "this is a significant lacuna in our current model and we have begun work on incorporating multiple polymer chains into our theory to model inter - chain e / h transfer and recombination dynamics .",
    "what is also curious is that our predictions , a and the observation that the el efficiency is dependent upon the rate of formation of emissive states , then the formation rate constant should be the limiting factor in the recombination process following electro - injection and not the electron / hole diffusion time .",
    "surprisingly , the diffusion times for charge carriers is significantly longer than the recombination rates reported herein and for that matter predicted by other groups .",
    "moreover , since carrier diffusion is more or less independent of spin - state ( due to the fact the carriers are non - interacting ) , one expects that the el efficiency to not depend upon the recombination process and should reflect the 1:3 ratio of singlets to triplets in the system .",
    "we hope that further experimental and theoretical work will shed some additional light onto the electroluminescence mechanism in organic polymers .",
