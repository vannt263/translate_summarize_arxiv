    "the self - organization of a network appears in a variety of subjects : biological growth , river formation , urban planning , and technological infrastructure design .",
    "they are too diverse to comprehend the complex processes involved in chemical , physical , and socioeconomic phenomena .",
    "while we do not insist on the detailed processes , we may find a common mechanism for generating efficient and robust networks at low cost in an optimization principle .",
    "in particular , a point of contact in the fields of biology , computer science , and physics is important for understanding a foundation for the self - organization mechanism",
    ".    some biologically - motivated algorithms may be useful , e.g. , the slime mold _ physarum polycephalum _",
    "forms efficient , economic , and fault - tolerant networks similar to the railway system in the tokyo metropolitan area @xcite . in the networks",
    ", each node tends to connect to neighbor nodes in order to approach food sources , and some links which do not contribute to energy transport gradually disappear .",
    "thus , short paths between any two nodes are self - organized on a planar space .",
    "a similar mechanism based on diffusive growth following chemotaxis is applied in the modeling of leaf venation patterns @xcite and morphogenesis @xcite . moreover , in human trail systems @xcite , frequently used trails are more strongly marked , but rarely used trails are destroyed by the weathering effect .",
    "apart from detailed processes , the key concepts of self - organization are the selective reinforcement of preferred routes and the removal of redundant connections .",
    "removing the weakest links is also economically reasonable in the natural selection for maintaining efficient transportation and communication networks @xcite .    in complex network science ,",
    "several models have been proposed for the coevolution of network formation and opinion spreading with the phase transition of the community size @xcite and for the coupled dynamics with network evolution and packet flows by random walkers @xcite ; the hub emergence is parametrically controllable in the phase transition of the topological structure .",
    "another idea of path reinforcement is introduced by iteratively adding a bypass between nodes separated by two hops on frequently traveled paths @xcite . through the induced diffusion process by random walkers ,",
    "quasi - complete and scale - free ( sf ) networks emerge from the initial 1d - chain and 2d - lattice , respectively",
    ". however , in the topological formations involved with diffusive flow dynamics @xcite , the geographical positions of nodes are ignored or restricted in spite of their importance at least for transportation and communication networks .",
    "in addition , these network structures are not necessarily desirable due to the large cost of maintaining many links and the vulnerability against hub attacks @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a planar network emerges through directional growth just like in leaf venation patterns @xcite for connecting to the geographical neighbors from new nodes whose positions follow a given spatial distribution related to the population density in city road formation @xcite .",
    "it is also an attractive feature that in reaction - diffusion networks @xcite , various topologies , from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures , are controlled by rewirings according to the change of an external condition . in the typical model for ad hoc communication @xcite related to adaptive linking mechanisms ,",
    "a clustered network emerges on the random positions of nodes connected within a transmission range , in order to prevent energy consumption .",
    "thus , beyond an extremely heterogeneous structure like sf networks , challenges to the self - organization of both efficient and robust networks are continued successfully .    in this paper , we aim to develop a new design method for the self - organization of networks in a wireless environment",
    ". the issues of connectivity , scalability , routing and topology control in ad - hoc networks have been pointed out with the importance of mathematical models motivated by graph theory @xcite .",
    "we further consider the strong effects of shortcuts on communication efficiency and the robustness of connectivity .",
    "let us consider an initial network as a well - studied model for wireless ad hoc communication , which is called a unit disk graph ( udg ) @xcite in computer science .",
    "the decentralized complex system design is very important in challenging discussions for future network infrastructures @xcite .",
    "each node corresponds to a base station for multi - hop communication in a wireless environment . without any biased condition ,",
    "the positions of nodes are distributed uniformly at random in the normalized @xmath0 area .",
    "we assume that each node has a single transmission range denoted by @xmath1 . in the disk area with the radius @xmath2 centered at a node , the node can directly communicate with its geographic neighboring nodes . here , @xmath3 is the network size ( the total number of nodes ) of a udg . in other words ,",
    "this condition for proximity connections is equivalent to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the euclidean distance between two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 on a plane , and @xmath8 is the normalization factor .",
    "note that proximity connections are economically appropriate for transportation and communication networks , while low consumption for the transmission involves a weak connectivity .",
    "one of the issues related to the udg is how large the transmission range needs to be connective between any nodes via a path of multi - hops in the networks .",
    "figure [ fig_prop_udg](a ) shows the phase transition of the connectivity for a transmission range @xmath1 .",
    "this result is consistent with that presented in refs .",
    "we define the connectivity ratio by a relative size @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the number of nodes which can reach each other via direct or multi - hop paths in the largest connected component ( also called the giant component ) . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath11 to be connective via a path between two nodes in almost all pairs .",
    "although denser connections are obtained at each node for a larger value of @xmath1 , it is numerically confirmed that our discussion is not affected by the results after this section . because redundant links are removed in the course of time , even if there are many initial connections , then the remaining ( not removed but surviving ) links are almost the same as long as there is an initial high connectivity ratio . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_prop_udg ] ( b ) , a udg for @xmath11 consists of small degrees in the distribution with an exponential decay .",
    "therefore , it has no hub , since the maximum degree is small as @xmath12 estimated from @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "( a )    ( b )      at the beginning , to simplify the discussion , we consider only two types of nodes : the normal node and the active node corresponding to the food source @xcite .",
    "we assume that the type is initially fixed at each node , for example , we set the number of active nodes are at @xmath16 of the total @xmath3 , and the remaining @xmath17 are normal nodes .",
    "the positions of nodes are given by the udg .",
    "at each time step @xmath18 , @xmath19 packets are generated over the network , where @xmath20 is the number of surviving nodes at time @xmath18 , as mentioned in subsection 2.4 .",
    "some normal and active nodes are removed from the initial udg in the self - organization of the network . here",
    ", a communication request stochastically occurs between two nodes of the source and the terminal ( where it is also called a destination in computer science ) as follows : a packet is generated at rates @xmath21 from normal and active source nodes .",
    "the terminal nodes are also randomly chosen at the rates .",
    "in other words , an active node is @xmath22 times more likely to be chosen as the source or terminal than a normal node and @xmath23 , we derive the packet generation probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 at a node per step . ] .",
    "note that there is a one - to - one correspondence between source / terminal and packet .",
    "thus , for @xmath26 packets per step , the source and the terminal are randomly chosen for normal and active nodes according to the rates",
    ".    we can extend this simple setting of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the fraction of nodes to any probability distribution for choosing the source and the terminal in a more realistic situation ; packets are generated proportionally to a population in the territory of a node . by using a statistical population data on a geographical map , each mesh block ( corresponding to a set of users )",
    "is assigned to the nearest access node ( corresponding to a base station ) in the sense of the euclidean distance .",
    "the merged region by the assigned blocks to a node is its territory .",
    "then , the population in the territory is defined by a sum of data at the assigned blocks .",
    "figure [ fig_cum_pop ] shows the cumulative population of nodes whose positions are uniformly at random for the initial setting of udgs on a geographical map .",
    "note that the density function of the population is nearly exponential , since the cumulative distribution is almost linear in a semi - log plot , and the derivative of an exponential function is also exponential .",
    "we confirm similar exponential - like distributions for several population data at other locations measured by the japan statistical association . in such real data , it is common that big cities are located apart from each other while some nodes with high populations in their territories concentrate in and around a city . thus , the selection of a node as the source or the terminal of a packet is proportional to the population in its territory under the normalization to be a probability distribution . for @xmath26 packets per step , this process is repeated .",
    "we call it the packet generation according to the population .",
    "although probabilistic selections of the source and the terminal are due to a general problem setting for the simulation , in practice , their nodes should be chosen by an objective determined beforehand .",
    "therefore , it is natural for a user to know the position of a terminal without global information .",
    "this explanation supports a decentralized routing with only local information in the next subsection .      instead of the random walk @xcite",
    ", we consider a greedy routing @xcite developed in computer science , as shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig_modified_greedy ] .",
    "it is also called a greedy searching or greedy forwarding algorithm . in order to forward a packet from the resident node @xmath29 to a closer position to its terminal @xmath18 in the sense of the euclidean distance on a plane ,",
    "a node @xmath30 is chosen in the set @xmath31 of connecting one - hop neighbors of @xmath29 , if the distance @xmath32 between nodes @xmath30 and @xmath18 is minimum : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where ties for the minimum are broken randomly in @xmath31 . in this paper ,",
    "the protocol is modified to that a packet is always transferred to a connecting neighbor @xmath36 even if @xmath37 ( see the top right of fig . [ fig_modified_greedy ] ) . moreover , to avoid falling into a trap of cycles , we apply the self - avoiding rule : a packet is not transferred to nodes that have already been visited ( see the bottom right of fig . [ fig_modified_greedy ] ) , whose history is stored in memory .",
    "this deterministic routing can act with only local information ( e.g. positions of one - hop neighbors measured by a gps ) even for any topological change including the mobility of nodes .",
    "note that all existing packets independently move to one - hop neighbors by a one - time step .",
    "if a packet either arrives at its terminal or encounters a dead - end , it is removed .     or @xmath38 in the set @xmath31 of connecting one - hop neighbors , and the dashed line denotes @xmath32 measured by the euclidean distance from @xmath36 to the terminal @xmath18 .",
    "the curved line represents a path from the source @xmath39 to the current resident node @xmath29 of a packet.,height=377 ]      we propose the following efficient networks that are self - organized through two phases : the removal of links and the addition of shortcuts depending on traffic flows . here",
    ", the simultaneous implementation of the two phases is outside the scope of this fundamental proposal , since the network generated by the simultaneous implementation destroys the initial structure of a udg in a wireless environment and does not stably converge to a topological structure except with the trivial connections between active nodes",
    ". how to simultaneously implement them will be an issue .",
    "first , we explain the base model for self - organization . in a * link survival(ls ) * network , if a packet passes a link on the modified greedy routing , the weight is increased by @xmath40 . after the forwarding process for all packets",
    ", we check whether all link weights are decreased by @xmath40 with probability @xmath41 . when the weight reaches @xmath42 after the decreases chosen with @xmath43 through several steps , then the link is removed , and isolated nodes without any links are also removed . from an initial udg with size @xmath3 , both the increase and the decrease of link weights are repeated until @xmath44 steps in the steady state .",
    "the initial weights are set to 5 for all links in order not to be removed before packets reach them .",
    "next , we consider a * path reinforcement(pr ) * network extended from the ls network by adding shortcuts . after stopping the removal of links at @xmath45",
    ", we continue the network generation and the transfer of packets to make @xmath46 @xmath47 or @xmath48 of shortcuts for the total number of surviving links in the ls network .",
    "each shortcut link is added between the current resident node of a randomly chosen packet and a randomly chosen node from the nodes that have already been visited on the routing path before arriving at its terminal .",
    "such a direct shortcut between nodes separated by more than two hops suppresses the forming of a quasi - complete graph @xcite in the hop - by - hop connections . to compare the communication efficiency and the robustness of connectivity with ls and pr networks",
    ", we further consider a * random shortcut(rs ) * network .",
    "it is constructed by adding @xmath46 @xmath47 or @xmath48 of shortcuts between two randomly chosen nodes independently from the positions of packets on the ls network .",
    "we emphasize that , in the previous studies for sf @xcite and multi - scale quartered ( msq ) @xcite networks , the robustness is significantly improved by adding such random shortcuts .",
    "we do not discuss how to implement shortcut links in practice , since the problem will be solved by future wireless technologies , such as control of directivity and beam power , a hybrid network with wired links , etc .",
    "in addition , the values of @xmath43 and @xmath45 are set to be merely convenient for the simulation .",
    "for other values , we obtain results that are similar to those presented in the next section , provided that the value of @xmath43 is not too large to maintain the connectivity .",
    "although almost all surviving links do not change any longer around @xmath49 steps , we take sufficient time for @xmath45 .    . in the ls , pr , and rs networks ,",
    "the surviving nodes concentrate in high - population areas for which data is provided by the japan statistical association .",
    "the gradation of mesh blocks from light to dark ( white , yellow , orange , red ) corresponds to the population density .",
    "the thick and thin lines are 10 % shortcuts and the other links in the ls network , respectively .",
    "the size of a black node is proportional to the population in its territory.,height=517 ]",
    "we investigate the topological structures of ls , pr , and rs networks . here , the inclusion of graphs and the extension with shortcuts are udg @xmath50 ls @xmath51 pr or rs , and the positions of nodes are identical in these networks except for the removed parts . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_visualize ] , an ls network is obtained from a udg by removing some nodes in the ( white ) mountain or sea areas of low - population density , while the pr and rs networks have comparatively longer shortcuts between the areas of high - population density and between random positions , respectively .",
    "we remark that the ls network resembles a planar network without crossing links .",
    "the large black nodes correspond to active nodes with more packet generations .",
    "surviving nodes naturally concentrate in dark ( red ) areas of large population similar to a router density map @xcite in the real world . here , the population in the territory of a removed node is reassigned to its neighboring nodes in the iterative process of network generation . remember that the initial distribution of population assigned to a node in the udg or to the original mesh in @xmath52 blocks decays exponentially ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cum_pop ] ) .",
    "this exponential - like distribution of population is consistent for ls networks after surviving some nodes . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the results obtained for the packet generation according to the population .",
    "when the probability of packet generation at a node is set by @xmath28 and @xmath27 or by an exponential distribution @xmath53 , where @xmath15 is a parameter and @xmath54 is an i d number : @xmath55 randomly assigned to a node in the udg with no relation to its geographical position , there are no changes qualitatively .",
    "( a )    ( b )    .average degree @xmath56 ( top ) and link length @xmath57 ( bottom ) in the networks with active - normal nodes and the corresponding results for the packet generation according to the population .",
    "each value is obtained by the average of @xmath58 realizations generated from udgs with the initial size @xmath59 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as typical measures for the communication efficiency , we investigate the degrees and the link lengths . because they are related to the costs for maintaining connections at a node and for constructing a link by wireless beam or wire cable , smaller values are suitable for the efficiency .",
    "the costs are usually evaluated by the maximum ( in the worst case ) and the average or the high - frequency ( in a standard case ) values over a network .",
    "figures [ fig_pk_pl](a)(b ) show the distributions of degree and link length , and table [ table_ave ] shows their averages .",
    "the increasing order of @xmath56 is ls @xmath60 pr @xmath61 rs @xmath60 udg , and that of @xmath57 is udg @xmath60 ls @xmath60 pr @xmath60 rs .",
    "in particular , rs networks have on average twice as long links than pr networks .",
    "it is a cause of the difference in @xmath57 that the length of a shortcut is affected by the paths of packets in pr networks while it is determined only by the spatial distribution of surviving nodes which are embedded in rs networks .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pk_pl](b ) , pr networks are more efficient in the sense of link length by far than rs networks with no restriction on the link length except the scale of the area . on the whole , since the high - frequency parts of @xmath62 and @xmath63 consist of small values in spite of the effect of longer shortcuts added in the pr and rs networks , these networks are efficient with small degrees and short links .",
    "( a )    ( b )    as another measure of the efficiency , the average number of hops @xmath64 on the shortest paths ( measured by the minimum number of hops between two nodes ) is important , because fewer hops are better for communicating through intermediate nodes as quickly as possible .",
    "it is useful to investigate the scaling behavior of @xmath64 versus @xmath65 for checking the small - world ( sw ) effect @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_smallworld](a ) , the @xmath66 scaling in ls networks is improved to @xmath67 characterized as the sw effect in pr and rs networks with only 10 - 30 % of shortcuts .",
    "surprisingly , this effect appears even in pr networks with more restricted shortcuts on the paths than in rs networks .",
    "such change of scaling behaviors numerically occur within a transition of random - sw - regular phases @xcite , when the addition of long distance connections on a @xmath68-dimensional lattice is restricted by a probability @xmath69 for the distance @xmath70 with a control parameter @xmath71 .",
    "the related theoretical analysis is provided in @xcite ; however it is still open for more general cases beyond lattice structures . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath66 scaling usually appears in planar networks @xcite .",
    "table [ table_nt ] shows the number @xmath65 of surviving nodes from the initial size @xmath3 of udgs .",
    "the above improvement is also obtained for other paths on the modified greedy routing ; however , the improvement becomes smaller as shown in the inset .",
    "figure [ fig_smallworld](b ) shows the high reachability for the modified greedy routing in all of the networks .",
    "the reachability is defined by the fraction of packets successfully arriving at the terminals ( they are not stopped at dead - ends ) over all of the generated packets until @xmath45 steps after constructing the networks .",
    "we confirm the effect of shortcuts on the robustness against random failures and intentional attacks , in which nodes are removed at random and in decreasing order of degree before the removals , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig_robust ] shows the relative size @xmath72 of a giant component ( gc ) at @xmath73 and the average size @xmath74 of the isolated clusters except the gc .",
    "the critical fraction of failures for the breaking of gc increases from 0.6 in ls networks to 0.8 in pr and rs networks with shortcuts .",
    "the critical fraction of attacks also increases from 0.4 in ls networks to around 0.6 in pr and rs networks . in comparison within similar average degrees ,",
    "this robustness is at the same level in the optimal bimodal networks @xcite , and slightly stronger than that for delaunay triangulations ( dt ) with @xmath75 @xcite and msq networks based on a self - similar tiling @xcite with @xmath76 .",
    "remember that @xcite a gc is broken by attacking only a few percent of hubs in sf networks .",
    "in addition , the interesting problem is whether the percolation transition exists or not in our self - organized networks .",
    "especially , the critical point of @xmath74 is indistinct for random failures in the pr networks marked by circles at the bottom left of fig .",
    "[ fig_robust ] in the cases of packet generation according to the population ( also for other data ) ; however the divergence peak appears in the cases of an artificially defined probability distribution for packet generation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fs_exp ] .",
    "we will further investigate the reason why the difference occurs .",
    "in summary , we propose self - organized geographical networks by link survival and addition of shortcuts according to packet flows on decentralized routing in a wireless environment .",
    "we show that the positions of surviving nodes naturally concentrate on the areas of high - population density , and that the links between them are short . by adding only 10 - 30 % shortcuts ,",
    "the average number of hops on the routing paths is improved from @xmath66 in ls networks to @xmath67 as the sw effect @xcite . moreover , for both random failures and intentional attacks , the robustness of connectivity increases to reach the same level as in the optimal bimodal networks @xcite .",
    "the uniformly random shortcuts are slightly better for the robustness than the ones by the path reinforcement .",
    "probably , random shortcuts tend to be useful for a strong robustness by bridging distributed local areas ; however the optimal shortcuts are an open problem .",
    "thus , our self - organized networks with shortcuts keep a high communication efficiency in sf networks , but also overcome their vulnerability @xcite . for other criteria , e.g. maximizing the end - to - end throughput @xcite , it is an attractive issue to find the optimal network structure and the self - organization mechanism .",
    "various network formations by other weight update rules and routings will be also further investigated for future communication infrastructures , smart grids , and urban planning .",
