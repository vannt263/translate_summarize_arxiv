    "unconventional superconductors exhibit different features interesting both from the fundamental point of view and for possible applications review(d - wave ) .",
    "in particular , double degenerated state can be realized in _",
    "d_-wave josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "if the misorientation angle between the banks of the junction @xmath0 is taken @xmath1 , the energy minima of the system appear at the order parameter phase difference @xmath2 .",
    "these degenerate states correspond to the counter flowing currents along the junction boundary .",
    "such characteristics make _ d_-wave josephson junctions interesting for applications , such as qubits @xcite .",
    "our proposition was to make these qubits controllable with the externally injected along the boundary transport current @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the transport current and the spontaneous one do not add up  more complicated interference of the condensate wave functions takes place .",
    "this is related to the phenomena , known as the paramagnetic meissner effect @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite that at the boundary of some high-@xmath3 superconductors placed in external magnetic field the current flows in the direction opposite to the diamagnetic meissner supercurrent which screens the external magnetic field .",
    "this countercurrent is carried by the surface - induced quasiparticle states .",
    "these nonthermal quasiparticles appear because of the sign change of the order parameter along the reflected quasiparticle trajectory .",
    "such a depairing mechanism is absent in the homogeneous situation .",
    "note that in a homogeneous conventional superconductor at zero temperature the quasiparticles appear only when the landau criterion is violated , at @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5  is the superfluid velocity which parameterizes the current - carrying state , @xmath6 stands for the bulk order parameter , and @xmath7  is the fermi momentum .",
    "the appearance of the countercurrent can be understood as the response of the weak link with negative self - inductance to the externally injected transport supercurrent .",
    "the state of the junction in the absence of the transport supercurrent at zero temperature is unstable at @xmath8from the point of view that small deviations @xmath9  change the josephson current  from @xmath10  to its maximal value @xcite .",
    "the response of the josephson junction to small transport supercurrent at @xmath11  produces the countercurrent @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the equilibrium state with the persistent current in 1d normal metal ring with strong spin - orbit interaction : there is degeneracy at zero temperature  and @xmath12 , and the response of the ring is different at @xmath13  or @xmath14 , where @xmath15  is the effective magnetic field which enters in the hamiltonian through the zeeman term ( which breaks time - reversal symmetry ) @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted by small effective magnetic field so that the persistent current rapidly changes from @xmath10  to its maximum value . in the case of the weak link between two superconductors in the absence of the transport supercurrent there is degeneracy between @xmath16 and @xmath17  zero - energy states ; both the time - reversal symmetry breaking by the surface ( interface ) order - parameter and the doppler shift ( due to the transport supercurrent or magnetic field ) lift the degeneracy and result in the surface ( interface ) current @xcite .    in recent years",
    "mesoscopic superconducting structures continue to attract attention because of the possible application as qubits , quantum detectors etc .",
    "( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , such structures can be controlled by the transport supercurrent and the magnetic flux ( through the phase difference on josephson contact ) .",
    "this was in the focus of many recent publications , e.g. @xcite .",
    "here we continue to study the mesoscopic current - carrying _ d_-wave structures .",
    "particularly , we study the impact of the transport supercurrent on the density of states in both homogeneous film and in the film which contains a weak link .",
    "we consider a perfect contact between two clean singlet superconductors .",
    "the external order parameter phase difference @xmath18 is assumed to drop at the contact plane at @xmath19 .",
    "the homogeneous supercurrent flows in the banks of the contact along the @xmath20-axis , parallel to the boundary .",
    "the sample is assumed to be smaller than the london penetration depth so that the externally injected transport supercurrent can indeed be treated as homogeneous far from the weak link .",
    "the size of the weak link is assumed to be smaller than the coherence length .",
    "such a system can be quantitatively described by the eilenberger equation @xcite .",
    "taking transport supercurrent into account leads to the doppler shift of the energy variable by @xmath21 .",
    "the standard procedure of matching the solutions of the bulk eilenberger equations at the boundary gives the matsubara green s function @xmath22 at the contact at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "then for the component @xmath23 of @xmath24 , which defines both the current density and the density of states ( see below ) , we obtain in the left ( @xmath25 ) and right ( @xmath26 ) banks of the junction:@xmath27 \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{2\\left\\vert \\mathbf{r}% \\right\\vert \\omega _ { l , r}}{\\left\\vert v_{x}\\right\\vert } \\right ) , \\label{g_l_r}\\]]@xmath28@xmath29here @xmath30 are matsubara frequencies , @xmath31 stands for the order parameter in the left ( right ) bank , and @xmath32the direction - dependent doppler shift @xmath21 results in the modification of current - phase dependencies and in the appearance of the countercurrent along the boundary .",
    "the function @xmath33 defines the current density , as following : @xmath34here @xmath35 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath36 denotes averaging over the directions of fermi velocity @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath37 .",
    "analytic continuation of @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath40gives the retarded green s function , which defines the density of states : @xmath41here @xmath42 is the relaxation rate in the excitation spectrum of the superconductor .",
    "the local density of states can be probed with the method of the tunnelling spectroscopy by measuring the tunnelling conductance @xmath43 of the contact between our superconducting structure and the normal metal scanning tunnelling microscope s ( stm ) tip . at low temperature the dependence of the conductance on the bias voltage @xmath44",
    "is given by the following relation duke:@xmath45where @xmath46 is the conductance in the normal state ; @xmath47 is the angle - dependent superconductor - insulator - normal metal barrier transmission probability .",
    "the barrier can be modelled _",

    "@xcite with the uniform probability within the acceptance cone @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the polar angle and the small value of @xmath50 describes the thick tunnelling barrier:@xmath51where @xmath52 is the theta function .",

    "such problem can be described with the equations presented in the previous section as following @xcite .",
    "consider the specular reflection at the border , when the boundary between the current - carrying @xmath61-wave superconductor and the insulator can be modelled as the contact between two superconductors with the order parameters given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 and with @xmath64 .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( [ g(0 ) ] ) we have the following:@xmath65where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this expression is valid for any relative angle @xmath0 between the @xmath59-axis and the normal to the boundary ; in particular,@xmath68the accurate dependence of the gap function @xmath69 can be obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite with introducing @xmath42 as following : @xmath70 ( which is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ g(e ) ] ) ) .",
    "the energy values in this paper are made dimensionless with the zero - temperature gap at zero current : @xmath71 .    and now with eqs .",
    "( [ g0_chi = pi4 ] ) and ( [ g(e)]-[g(ev ) ] ) we plot the stm conductance for the current - carrying @xmath61-wave film in fig .",
    "we obtain the suppression of the zero - bias conductance peak by the transport supercurrent , as was studied in much detail in ref .",
    "our results are in agreement with their fig",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite developed the model based on phase fluctuations in the btk formalism to explain the suppression of the zero - bias conductance peak .",
    "however , their theoretical result , fig .",
    "2 , describes the experimental one only qualitatively , leaving several distinctions .",
    "they are the following : ( i ) position of the minima ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the experiment and the theory respectively ) ; ( ii ) height of the zero - bias peak at zero transport current ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively ) ; ( iii ) height of the peak at maximal transport current ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively ) ; ( iv ) presence / absence of the minima for all curves .",
    "our calculations , fig .",
    "( [ didv ] ) , demonstrate agreement with the experiment in all these features .",
    "the agreement we obtained with two fitting parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath50 .     for the homogeneous current - carrying state in the _ d_-wave film for different values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 at @xmath80.,width=302 ]    to further demonstrate the impact of the two fitting parameters of our model , @xmath42 and @xmath50 , in fig .",
    "( [ splitting ] ) we plot the normalized conductance fixing one of them and changing another .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates how they change the shape of the curves : the position of the minima , splitting of the zero - bias peak etc .",
    "note that the splitting is suppressed at small @xmath50 and high @xmath42 .",
    "this absence of the splitting was observed in the experiment @xcite and studied in several articles , e.g. @xcite .",
    "consider now the weak link between two @xmath61-wave current - carrying banks .",
    "for studying the effect of both the transport current and the phase difference on the density of states in the contact , we propose the scheme , presented in the right inset in fig .",
    "the supercurrent is injected along @xmath20-axis in the superconducting film , as it was discussed in the previous section . besides",
    ", the weak link is created by the impenetrable for electrons partition at @xmath19 .",
    "the small break in this partition ( @xmath81 ) plays the role of the weak link in the form of the pinhole model @xcite .",
    "the stm tip in the scheme is positioned above the weak link to probe the density of states in it .",
    "two more contacts along the @xmath58-axis provide the order parameter phase difference @xmath18 along the weak link .",
    "this can be done , for example , by connecting the contacts with the inductance , as shown in the scheme , and applying magnetic flux @xmath82 to this inductance .",
    "then one obtains the phase control of the contact with the relation : @xmath83 .",
    "the two half - plains ( for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) play the role of the two banks of the contact , which we also call left and right superconductors . in our scheme",
    "the banks carry the transport current along the boundary , and the josephson current along the contact is created due to the phase difference .",
    "the banks we consider to be @xmath61-wave superconductors with @xmath57-axis along the @xmath86-axis and with the misorientation angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "now we can apply the equations presented in sec .",
    "ii to describe the conductance characteristics of the contact between current - carrying @xmath61-wave superconductors .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ conductance ] , where the normalized conductance is plotted for two values of the phase difference , for @xmath2 and with @xmath89 .",
    "the two values of the phase difference , @xmath2 , are particularly interesting for the application since they correspond to the double - degenerate states @xcite .",
    "so , the density of states is the same in the absence of the transport supercurrent in both panels in fig .",
    "conductance with mid - gap states ( at @xmath90 ) which create the spontaneous current along the boundary .",
    "the transport supercurrent ( @xmath91 ) removes the degeneracy by significantly changing the mid - gap states ( fig .",

    "we have studied the density of states in the current - carrying @xmath61-wave structures .",
    "namely , we have considered , first , the homogeneous situation and , second , the superconducting film with the weak link .",
