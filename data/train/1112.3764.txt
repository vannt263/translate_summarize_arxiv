    "mergers are thought to be one of the primary drivers of galaxy evolution , at least since @xmath3 .",
    "theories and simulations have shown that mergers are able to transform the structure of a galaxy , and are required for the mass assembly of galaxies .",
    "however , it remains an open issue how important merging is , compared to other physical mechanisms such as cold gas accretion or secular evolution .",
    "hence there is a motivation to quantify the importance of merger through observations .",
    "typically merger candidates are identified from photometric catalogues through either pair selection @xcite or morphology @xcite .",
    "irregular morphologies at high redshift could be due to cosmological surface - brightness dimming or clumpy star formation , and are not always related to merging activity . hence we focus on using pair counts as a probe for identifying mergers in this work .",
    "we use a compilation of all public photometric data in the cosmos field , in 30 + narrow- , medium- and broad - bands covering wavelengths in uv , optical , nir and mid - ir .",
    "photo-@xmath0 s and stellar population fitting are derived using the eazy and fast codes with standard parameters . we constrain ourselves to the area which has @xmath4/nicmos @xmath5-band imaging , which covers @xmath6 of the cosmos area . the observed nir imaging probes the rest - frame optical wavelength , which is a better tracer of the bulk stellar mass compared to observed optical ( rest - frame uv )",
    ". there are 196 massive ( @xmath7 ) galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "we run ` sextractor ` on the nicmos cutouts of the massive galaxies , and select galaxy pairs with these two criteria : ( 1 ) the massive galaxy has one or more companion within a projected separation of 30 kpc ; and ( 2 ) the @xmath5-flux ratio of the pair is between 1:4 to 1:1 . imposing these criteria we find 40 massive galaxies in pairs , in the redshift range of @xmath8 .",
    "the pair fraction is corrected for chance projection using two different approaches : ( 1 ) we perform a monte - carlo simulation , in which the positions of all the cosmos sources are redistributed randomly and we replicate our pair selection ; or ( 2 ) we impose an additional criterion : if the companion has a separate cosmos entry with reliable photo-@xmath0 ( ` odds ` @xmath9 0.95 ) , the 3@xmath10 confidence intervals of the photo-@xmath0 s must overlap .",
    "as seen on figure  [ fig : pf_lit ] , the pair fraction derived using the photo-@xmath0 criterion is remarkably consistent with the statistical approach , except at the highest redshift bin in which photo-@xmath0 s have higher uncertainties and therefore less constraining . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have performed a similar study with different samples .",
    "our results are consistent with theirs within the uncertainties .",
    "however , readers should be cautioned that @xcite claim a strong redshift evolution of the pair fraction , whereas @xcite claim a mild ( and even diminishing one ) . @xcite",
    "demonstrate with simulations that much of the discrepancy can be explained by the different criteria used in the analyses ( mass- or luminosity - selected parent sample , projected separation , etc . ) .    ,",
    "compared to other observations .",
    "the black circles denote the @xmath11 of our analysis , after statistically correcting for projection contamination .",
    "the black dotted line show the best - fitting power law to our @xmath11 , which is of the form @xmath12 .",
    "the orange diamonds denote our @xmath11 , which we use an alternative approach to correct for projection contamination with the available photo-@xmath0 s .",
    "the gray squares and circles represent the @xmath11 of @xcite using the gns and powir data .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    .",
    "the lines are normalized to the observed number density at @xmath13.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    assuming a merging timescale of @xmath14 gyr , we integrate the pair fraction over our redshift range and the co - moving volume , and find that * a massive galaxy experiences @xmath15 major mergers on average from @xmath2 to 0 .",
    "* observations have shown that massive galaxies grow 3 - 6 times in size during this epoch , and it has been estimated that 2 - 3 major mergers @xcite are required to explain this size growth . hence we can conclude that * mechanisms other than major merging are required to explain the size evolution*. this is not surprising as minor mergers are more frequent and more efficient in growing galaxies sizes @xcite .",
    "we estimate the number of newly created massive galaxies as follows : for each pair , we calculate the remnant mass as the sum of the sed masses of the galaxies in the pair . in the rare case",
    "( 4 pairs ) where the sed mass is not available for the companion galaxy because there is no corresponding entry in the catalogue , we use the flux ratio and the sed mass of the primary massive galaxy to estimate the remnant mass .",
    "the number of newly created massive galaxy ( n@xmath16 ) in each redshift bin is calculated by counting the galaxies that cross the mass limit after merging .",
    "the merger - induced increment in the co - moving number density ( @xmath17 , in units of mpc@xmath18 ) is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the time elapsed within the redshift bin .",
    "normalizing the number density of massive galaxies to the observation at @xmath21 , the results are compared with the observed number density of massive galaxies above these mass limits , as shown in figure  [ fig : numdens ] . considering the @xmath22 0.2 dex uncertainty in the number density growth due to counting statistics , the slope of the number growth is remarkably consistent with the observed number density .",
    "the agreement between our estimated merger - induced number density growth and the observed number density supports the idea that * major mergers are sufficient to explain the number density evolution of massive galaxies from @xmath23 to 0*.",
    "in the near future , i will make use of the deep , large - area ultravista survey in the cosmos field to analyze the pair fraction . in combination with the ultra - deep survey ( uds )",
    ", we should be able to trace the major and minor merger fraction at @xmath24 to less than 20% uncertainty",
    ". we will be able to investigate the effect of environment : one may expect higher pair fractions in overdense regions , but the relative velocities between the galaxy pairs might also be higher , such that the probability that the pair is undergoing a merger is low compared to the field .",
    "however , even if we had perfect measurements of the merger fraction , we are still unable to determine the observability timescale of the merger to less than 50% uncertainty . there are attempts to solve it through merger simulations , but the problem itself is complex : the timescale is sensitive to the initial conditions of the merger @xcite , such as mass ratio , gas fraction , dust content , relative velocity , orbital parameters , viewing angle , etc",
    ". some of these parameters may evolve with redshift and environment .",
    "hence more work needs to be done from the theory and the simulation fronts , to interpret statistically how the observed frequency of mergers impact the evolution of galaxies .",
    "* the pair fraction evolves only mildly with redshift since @xmath2 . * a massive galaxy experiences @xmath15 major mergers on average since @xmath2 .",
    "this amount of major merging is sufficient to explain the number of newly formed massive galaxies , but insufficient to explain the observed size evolution .",
    "this hints that massive galaxies undergo other mechanisms that is efficient in puffing up their sizes , but not so important in growing the mass .",
    "minor merging is compatible with this scenario . *",
    "it remains a challenge to constrain the observability timescale of mergers due to the complexity of the problem .",
    "its importance oughts to be highlighted , as it is a crucial quantity for interpreting the impact of mergers on the growth of galaxy population as a whole .    to everyone who organized or participated in the conference on galaxy mergers in an evolving universe ,",
