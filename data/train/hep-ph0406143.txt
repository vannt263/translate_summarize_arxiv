    "relatively light strongly - interacting fundamental particles may be considered as constituents of nucleons .",
    "the nature of these constituents and their experimental effects become evident when the parent hadrons are probed at sufficiently short distances or , equivalently , sufficiently large four - momentum transfer @xmath5 . the charm quark @xmath6 and the bottom quark @xmath7",
    "are treated appropriately as constituents of hadrons in situations in which @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "other strongly interacting fundamental particles may exist , as yet undiscovered experimentally , with masses lying somewhere between the bottom- and top - quark masses .",
    "one example is a relatively light gluino : a color - octet fermion and the supersymmetric partner of the massless spin-1 gluon . for our purposes ,",
    "we define a `` light '' particle to have a mass less than 100 gev . in this paper",
    ", we explore the effects that a color - octet fermion would have on the parton distribution functions of nucleons , with a view toward establishing whether the set of hard - scattering data used in global analysis may already place significant constraints on the existence and allowed masses of such states .    in our investigation , we use a light gluino from supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite as a concrete example , but our analysis and conclusions should apply as well to the case of a color - octet fermion of whatever origin . as constituents of hadrons ,",
    "these color - octet fermions share the momentum of the parent hadron with their standard model quark , antiquark , and gluon partners .",
    "the distribution of light - cone momentum fraction @xmath10 carried by constituents is specified by parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) as functions of both @xmath10 and the scale @xmath5 of the short - distance hard scattering .",
    "the process - independent pdfs are essential ingredients for obtaining normalized predictions of rates for hard - scattering reactions at high energies .",
    "a simultaneous analysis of a large body of scattering data ( global analysis ) provides strong constraints on the magnitude and @xmath10 dependence of the pdfs .",
    "in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the existence of a color - octet fermion and its couplings to the standard model constituents alter the coupled set of evolution equations that governs the functional change of the parton distributions as momentum is varied .",
    "gluinos have different renormalization group properties from those of the quark and gluon constituents , and the contributions of fermions in the color - octet representation are enhanced strongly . within the context of broken supersymmetry , squarks ( scalar partners of quarks )",
    "may also be relatively light , particularly those of the third generation , the bottom- and top - squarks  @xcite . in the study reported here",
    ", we include a gluino in our pdf analysis , but we neglect possible contributions from other hypothesized supersymmetric states with masses above a few gev , such as bottom squarks . as explained in sec .",
    "ii , the effects of squark contributions on the current data are much less important than those of gluinos .",
    "the approximation of retaining only the light gluino contribution simplifies the calculations while retaining most of the relevant physics .    in a global analysis of hadronic data , a large sample of data",
    "is studied ( about 2000 points ) from a variety of experiments at different momentum scales .",
    "the data set included in our study is the same as in the recent cteq6  @xcite study done within the context of the standard model .",
    "the data come from deep - inelastic lepton scattering , massive lepton pair and gauge boson production , and hadron jet production at large values of transverse momentum .",
    "we apply the methodology of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cteq6 analysis to explore the compatibility of a light gluino with the large set of hadronic data .",
    "methods developed recently for the analysis of uncertainties of pdfs  @xcite allow us to obtain quantitative bounds on the existence and masses of gluinos from a global analysis . in early pdf analyses within the context of light gluinos  @xcite , a gluino with a mass 5 gev or less was found to be consistent with the data available at that time .",
    "a more recent study  @xcite disfavors a gluino with a mass 1.6 gev or less . the much larger sample of the data in the modern fit and improved understanding of pdf uncertainties make it possible to derive more precise bounds .",
    "light superpartners influence the evolution with scale @xmath5 of the strong coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "the constraints we obtain on the gluino mass from a global analysis depend significantly on the value of the strong coupling strength @xmath0 that is an ingredient in the global analysis . in sec .",
    "ii , we begin with a brief review of the dominant experimental constraints on @xmath12 and consider the changes that may arise if supersymmetric particles and processes are present . further discussion of experimental constraints on @xmath0 may be found in the appendix .",
    "we describe in sec .",
    "ii.b how we implement the nlo evolution of the pdfs , while including the gluino degree of freedom at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "once supersymmetric particles are admitted , they contribute to hard scattering processes either as incident partons and/or as produced particles .",
    "we therefore specify the hard scattering matrix elements that describe supersymmetric contributions to the rate for jet production at large transverse momentum . in sec .",
    "iii , we present and discuss the results of our global fits .",
    "the discriminating power of our analysis depends crucially on the inclusion of the tevatron jet data in the fit .",
    "the inclusion of a light gluino in the pdfs removes momentum from the gluon pdf at large @xmath10 , tending to depress the contribution from sm processes to the jet rate at large @xmath13 .",
    "however , the effect is compensated partially by a larger value of @xmath0 , slower evolution of @xmath12 that makes @xmath14 larger than in the standard model , and by contributions to the jet rate from production of susy particles in the final state .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "we find that the hadron scattering data provide significant constraints on the existence of gluinos whose mass is less than the weak scale @xmath15  gev .",
    "a large region of gluino parameter space is excluded by the global analysis independently of direct searches or other indirect methods .",

    "the presence of a light gluino @xmath21 and/or a light squark @xmath22 modifies the pdf global analysis in three ways .",
    "first , the gluino and squark change the evolution of the strong coupling strength @xmath11 as the scale @xmath5 is varied .",

    "equation  ( [ beta0 ] ) shows that , to the leading order , one generation of gluinos @xmath21 contributes the equivalent of 3 quark flavors to the qcd @xmath31-function .",
    "the effect of one squark flavor is equivalent to one - fourth of the contribution of a quark flavor . in our work",
    ", we henceforth neglect the possibility of a light squark contribution to the @xmath31-function and limit ourselves to the effects of a light gluino .",
    "inclusion of a light bottom squark changes the running of @xmath12 slightly , compatible with current data  @xcite .",

    "the allowed range of the gluino mass @xmath18 depends strongly on the assumed value of the strong coupling @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the current experimental constraints on @xmath36 from sources other than hadron scattering data . a combined analysis of all @xmath1-pole data within the context of the standard model , carried out by a working group of members of the four cern large electron - positron collider ( lep ) experiments and the slac sld experiment  @xcite , obtains the value @xmath37 .",
    "this value is but a shade greater than the often - quoted standard model world - average value @xmath38  @xcite obtained from a variety of determinations of @xmath11 at different momentum scales @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",

    "a recent estimate  @xcite of susy effects on directly measured @xmath41 finds values in the interval @xmath42 , where the variation in the central value arises from uncertainty in the magnitude of susy - qcd corrections to the @xmath1-boson decay width from processes such as @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    ", we include a light gluino and omit squark contributions .",
    "a squark enters parton splitting functions only in combination with another rare particle , and these splittings are characterized by smaller color factors than in the gluino case .",
    "we incorporate the gluino sector into the pdf evolution package used to build the cteq6 unpolarized parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure for extracting parton distribution functions from global qcd analysis is to parametrize the distributions at a fixed small momentum scale @xmath48 .",
    "the distributions at all higher @xmath5 are determined from these by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "the agreement with experiment is measured by an effective @xmath49 , which can be defined by @xmath50 , or by generalizations of that formula to include published systematic error correlations .",
    "the pdf shape parameters at @xmath48 are chosen to minimize @xmath49 and obtain the `` best fit '' pdfs .",
    "we choose the starting value @xmath51 for the qcd evolution equal to the smaller of the gluino mass @xmath18 or charm quark mass @xmath52 . at the scale @xmath53 ,",

    "@xmath51 coincides with the charm quark mass : @xmath57 gev .",
    "therefore , for @xmath58 the input scale @xmath59  gev is the same as in the cteq6 study .",
    "we use the cteq6 functional forms for the input pdfs of the standard model partons at @xmath60 , but the starting values of the parameters are varied in order to obtain acceptable fits to the full set of scattering data .",
    "the prescription for @xmath51 allows us to investigate the possibility of gluinos lighter than charm quarks ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we include fits for gluino masses @xmath62  gev by choosing @xmath63 .",
    "such super - light gluinos may be generated both via perturbative and nonperturbative mechanisms , and , in principle , an independent phenomenological parametrization must be introduced for the gluino pdf to describe nonperturbative contributions .",
    "our prescription for the region @xmath61 provides a particular model for such an input gluino parametrization , similar in its spirit to the dynamical parton distributions of the grv group @xcite , as well as the procedure used in earlier light gluino analyses @xcite and @xcite .   and @xmath64  gev . ]    in the presence of a light gluino",
    ", the dglap equations must be extended to account for the new processes .",

    "the splitting functions @xmath73 may be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a gluino in the evolution equations complicates the calculation substantially . to achieve acceptable accuracy , evolution of the quarks and gluons",
    "must certainly be done at next - to - leading order accuracy . however , without a substantial loss in accuracy , we can simplify the overall calculation by evaluating the gluino contributions to leading order accuracy only .",
    "we use the following prescription :    1 .   evolve the ordinary quarks and gluons at nlo ( so that the splitting functions @xmath74 @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are evaluated to order @xmath78 ) .",
    "2 .   evolve the gluinos at lo ( so that the splitting functions @xmath79 @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are evaluated to @xmath84 ) .",

    "the evolution is fully accurate to nlo except for the gluino splitting kernels .",
    "were we interested in a process dominated by gluino contributions , we might need a nlo representation of the gluino pdf , @xmath69 .",
    "however , the impact of the gluino pdf is minimal for the inclusive data in the global analysis , since @xmath69 is much smaller than the quark and gluon pdfs ( cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig : xf : q10 ] and [ fig : xf : q100 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the gluino plays only an indirect role .",
    "its presence modifies the fit in two ways :    1 .",
    "the gluino alters @xmath11 , thereby modifying the evolution of ordinary quark and gluon pdfs .",
    "2 .   the gluino carries a finite fraction of the hadron s momentum , thereby decreasing the momentum fraction available to the gluons and standard model quarks .",
    "regarding item ( 1 ) , we compute the effects of the gluino correctly by using the exact nlo beta function that includes susy effects .",
    "therefore , the only shortcoming of our prescription is with respect to item ( 2 ) .",
    "we describe correctly the nlo mixing between the quarks and the gluons , but the less consequential mixing of the standard model partons and the gluino is correct only to leading order . in the energy range of our interest ,",
    "the gluinos carry a small fraction ( @xmath86 ) of the proton s momentum .",
    "the neglected nlo corrections to this small quantity are further suppressed by a factor of @xmath87 .",
    "they are comparable in magnitude to the nnlo corrections for the standard model splittings , which are suppressed by @xmath88 .",
    "the uncertainty introduced by the omission of the nlo gluino splittings is comparable to that due to the nnlo corrections for other particles , and it may be ignored in the present nlo analysis .",
    "figures  [ fig : xf : q10 ] and  [ fig : xf : q100 ] illustrate and support our assumptions .",
    "they show the momentum distributions for the gluons , singlet quarks , and gluinos , respectively . in these figures , the strong coupling strength @xmath19 is equal to @xmath89 ( the value of @xmath90 assumed in the cteq6 analysis ) .",

    "the distributions are obtained from the light gluino ( lg ) fits for @xmath93  gev , with or without the inclusion of the tevatron jet data . for @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ", we also show the corresponding distributions from the best - fit set cteq6 m of the cteq6 analysis .    with @xmath96  gev , the gluino density @xmath97 . nevertheless , the effects of gluino contributions on the fit at @xmath98 gev force a change in the gluon and quark distribution functions from their standard model values at @xmath96  gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xf : q10 ] .",
    "once @xmath5 is evolved to @xmath91  gev , fig .",
    "[ fig : xf : q100 ] shows a nonzero momentum distribution for the gluinos and a persistent change of the gluon and quark densities from their cteq6 m standard model values .",
    "the figures demonstrate two important features .",
    "first , the magnitude of the gluino distribution is much smaller than the gluon and quark distributions .",
    "this large difference justifies the assumptions that contributions are small from scattering subprocesses with initial - state gluinos , and that nlo gluino contributions may be omitted in our analysis .",
    "second , the presence of the gluino depletes the gluon distribution at @xmath99 .",
    "the effect on the singlet distribution is less pronounced .",
    "the gluinos take their momentum ( @xmath100 of the proton s momentum at @xmath101  gev for @xmath93  gev ) from the gluons ( @xmath102 ) principally , less from quarks ( @xmath103 ) , independently of whether the tevatron jet data are included in the fit .",
    "since the jet data at large transverse energy @xmath13 are known to probe the behavior of @xmath104 at large @xmath105 i.e. , in the region where the depletion of the gluon s momentum is the strongest , we judge that inclusion of the jet data in the fit strengthens the constraining power of the fit .",
    "once light superpartners are introduced as degrees of freedom , we must consider their impact on all hard scattering processes .",
    "their effects can be felt both at tree level and in virtual - loop diagrams . at leading order in perturbation theory",
    ", we may consider hard subprocesses initiated by light gluinos or light bottom squarks that are constituents of the initial hadrons , as well as subprocesses in which gluinos or bottom squarks are emitted in the final state .",
    "we evaluate susy contributions to the hard matrix elements at leading order only for the same reasons that justify the omission of nlo susy contributions to the splitting kernels in sec .",
    "[ sec : dglap ] .",
    "the cteq6 fit is performed to data from lepton - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , vector boson production ( vbp ) , and hadronic jet production at the tevatron . in dis and vbp ,",
    "the lowest - order contribution from gluinos is @xmath106 at order @xmath84 .",
    "this subprocess proceeds via squark exchange , and its contribution can be neglected as being much smaller than the born - level qcd subprocesses ( which contribute at order @xmath107 ) .",
    "the bottom squarks can contribute at @xmath107 through the subprocesses @xmath108 in dis and @xmath109 in the drell - yan process .",
    "these contributions appear in a combination with a small bottom squark pdf @xmath110 and , therefore , are also negligible .",
    "we conclude that born - level susy contributions appear only in the tevatron jet production data , while , to the assumed level of accuracy , the hard matrix elements in dis and vbp remain the same as in the sm case .",
    "we now consider the influence that gluino subprocesses may have on the rate for jet production at large values of transverse energy @xmath111 .",
    "gluinos are color - octet fermions and , produced in the the final state , they materialize as jets . since the gluino parton density is relatively large only at small values of fractional momentum @xmath10 and , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : xf : q10 ] and [ fig : xf : q100 ] , is small even there when compared with the gluon and light - quark densities , we are justified in neglecting the contributions to the large @xmath111 jet rate from subprocesses initiated by two gluinos .",
    "an example is @xmath112 .",
    "however , in the interest of completeness , we include two subprocesses initiated by one gluino : @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "subprocesses initiated by gluons and/or light quarks can be important .",
    "we include @xmath115 via either a direct channel gluon or a cross channel gluino , and @xmath116 via a direct channel gluon .",
    "we can ignore the @xmath117-channel exchange diagrams that contribute to @xmath116 . with the possible exception of the bottom squark , the masses of most squarks are so large that the relevant @xmath117-channel amplitudes are negligible . in the case of bottom squark exchange ,",
    "the two initial - state partons would be bottom quarks , with small parton densities . for similar reasons",
    ", we may also ignore subprocesses such as @xmath118 .    at the tevatron",
    "@xmath119 collider , the @xmath120 partonic luminosity is relatively large in the region of large @xmath111 , and one might expect naively that the subprocess @xmath116 would increase the jet rate significantly .",
    "however , just as for the direct channel gluon subprocess @xmath121 in standard qcd , the squared matrix element for @xmath116 is relatively small .    in our treatment of jet production , we compute the matrix elements for the susy - qcd subprocesses at leading order .",
    "working at large @xmath122 , we neglect the gluino mass in the calculation .",
    "we include these matrix elements as additional contributions to the jet rate in the fitting program , adding them to those of the nlo standard model qcd processes [ @xmath123 to obtain constraints from the inclusive jet data .",
    "as indicated in the previous subsection , inclusion of a light gluino in the pdf set removes momentum from the gluon pdf at large @xmath10 , tending to depress the contribution from sm processes to the jet rate at large @xmath13 .",
    "however , as we show , the effect is compensated partially by a larger value of @xmath0 , by slower evolution of @xmath12 that makes @xmath14 larger than in the standard model , and by contributions to the jet rate from production of susy particles in the final state .",
