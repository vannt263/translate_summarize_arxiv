    "recently , chowdhury et al @xcite proposed the application of homotopy  perturbation method ( hpm ) to simple models of population dynamics and obtained approximate solutions in the form of perturbation series .",
    "the authors show that their approximate analytical results agree with the numerical solution of the problem and appear to suggest that the hpm series are convergent .",
    "a straightforward inspection of such series reveals that they are merely taylor expansions of the time variable .",
    "one does not expect such a local approximation to provide a reasonable description of the dynamics of nonlinear systems , except in the neighbourhood of the initial conditions.singular points appear spontaneously in nonlinear systems and move around the complex plane as the initial conditions vary @xcite which makes unlikely that the time series are valid for all time .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate the range of utility of the homotopy time series to provide useful insight on the dynamics of population models . in section [ sec : hpm ] we show that the hpm of chowdhury et al @xcite always leads to a taylor expansions of the solution of the nonlinear system about initial time . in section [ sec:1-d ]",
    "we analyze the exactly solvable one  dimensional problem already considered by chowdhury et al @xcite . in section [ sec:2-d ]",
    "we study their population model for two species @xcite and an exactly solvable two  dimensional dynamical model .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "population models give rise to differential equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a vector of the @xmath2 variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a vector  valued function with components @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that this vector  valued function is continuously differentiable .",
    "the hpm proposed by chowdhury et al @xcite is equivalent to a straightforward perturbation theory based on the modified equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a dummy perturbation parameter .",
    "notice that @xmath8 so that we set @xmath9 equal to unity at the end of the calculation .",
    "the hpm proposes a solution in the form of a series @xmath10 where @xmath9 is finally set equal to unity as said above .",
    "notice that since @xmath11 the resulting unperturbed or reference model @xmath12 seems to be quite poor at first sight .",
    "our results clearly show that it is actually the case .",
    "the initial conditions for the perturbation corrections are @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .    if we define the new time variable @xmath15 , then @xmath16 from which we conclude that @xmath17 and that this particular implementation of the hpm becomes the straightforward time series @xmath18 in agreement with the particular results derived by chowdhury et al @xcite .",
    "for example , the coefficient of first order is simply @xmath19 .",
    "we first consider the simple one  dimensional model @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this case",
    "we have an unstable node at @xmath23 and a stable one at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the exact solution is @xmath25    as mentioned above , the hpm series agree with the taylor expansion of the exact solution about @xmath26 : @xmath27    equation ( [ eq : x_1-d ] ) clearly sows that the solution has a pole at @xmath28 $ ] and , therefore , the hpm series does not converge for @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , then @xmath33 , then @xmath34 and the hpm series is unsuitable for @xmath35 as shown in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "notice that these results reflect the fact that the usefulness of the hpm depends on the initial conditions .",
    "besides , the hpm series does not take into consideration the stable node at @xmath24 and is therefore unable to reveal the main features of the dynamical behaviour of the system .",
    "chowdhury et al @xcite also discussed the simple two  species model @xmath36 and obtained accurate results for the model parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and initial conditions @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "however , the time interval considered by the authors is too small to give any indication of the evolution of this model ecosystem .    by inspection of the first terms of the hpm expansions @xmath45/2+\\ldots \\nonumber \\\\ y(t ) & = & y_{0}+ty_{0}(a_{21}x_{0}+a_{22}y_{0}+b_{2})+t^{2}y_{0}[a_{11}a_{21}x_{0}^{2}+a_{12}a_{21}x_{0}y_{0}+a_{21}^{2}x_{0}^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + a_{21}x_{0}(3a_{22}y_{0+}b1 + 2b_{2})+2a_{22}^{2}y_{0}^{2}+3a_{22}b_{2}y_{0}+b_{2}^{2}]/2+\\ldots \\label{eq:2-d_time_series}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we appreciate that if the model parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are sufficiently small ( as those chosen by chowdhury et al @xcite ) ,",
    "then the time series may give accurate results for an apparently large time interval .",
    "however , these series do not take into consideration the critical points of the model equations and therefore they can not reveal the actual dynamics of the system @xcite .    the nonlinear dynamical system ( [ eq:2-d_model ] ) exhibits four critical points in phase space @xcite : an unstable node at @xmath48 , two saddle points at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and a stable node at @xmath51 .    fig .",
    "[ fig:2-d ] shows that the population moves in phase space from the initial condition to the stable node and that the time series is unable to take into account this important dynamical behaviour .",
    "increasing the perturbation order from four ( the one used by chowdhury et al @xcite ) to ten just improves the accuracy for small time but worsens it at larger time which suggests that the convergence radii of the time series are rather too small .",
    "in other words , the time series do not allow us to study the important population portrait in phase space .    in order to appreciate a more dramatic failure of the time series consider the following system of nonlinear equations @xcite @xmath52 it is unsuitable for population dynamics because it allows negative values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 but has the great advantage of being exactly solvable .",
    "its solutions are @xmath55 we have an unstable spiral when @xmath56 and a stable one when @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we clearly see the pole at @xmath57 and realize that the time series will be completely useless for @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig:2-d_exact ] shows the numerical and approximate solutions for this model when @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we clearly notice that the time series fail completely to provide a qualitative description of the spiral point and thereby of the global details of the system dynamics .",
    "it is worth mentioning that multiple ",
    "scale perturbation theory @xcite gives the exact answer for this model and therefore appears to be a much more reliable perturbation approach for nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we have shown that :    * the homotopy perturbation method proposed by chowdhury et al @xcite is just the taylor expansion of the solutions of the nonlinear systems about @xmath26 . * the perturbation series , and consequently the hpm , is limited to a neighbourhood of the initial time determined by the singular point closest to the origin of the complex @xmath60plane .",
    "the locations of the singular points of the nonlinear models shift as the initial conditions vary .",
    "* the hpm does not give an acceptable qualitative description of the most important features of the evolution of the dynamical system in phase space . in this sense ,",
    "the hpm is by far less useful than the standard linearization which is also a local approach @xcite .    in principle",
    ", other implementations of the homotopy perturbation method may be more suitable for nonlinear dynamics .",
    "for example , we may choose the linear approximation about the critical or fixed points @xcite as unperturbed or reference model for the subsequent application of perturbation theory .",
    "since homotopy perturbation methods have become quite popular and are currently being applied to a wide variety of fields @xcite ( and references therein ) , present results become important because they suggest that a more careful scrutiny of the approach s performance is required ."
