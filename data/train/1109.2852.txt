    "disordered forms of silicon dioxide ( @xmath0 ) glasses play a key role in electronic device applications like semiconductor devices and optical fibers . amorphous silica has a structure consisting of a continuous random network of corner - sharing @xmath1 tetrahedra linked to a continuous three dimensional network @xcite . numerical simulations in the framework of classical molecular dynamics ( md ) has allowed in the past to clarify several issues connected with the structural properties of this material at the microscopic level .",
    "basis of this approach are interaction potentials fitted to _",
    "ab initio _ and experimental parameters .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite provides instead a description of both the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom and represents a powerful tool to study disordered systems .",
    "indeed , this approach allows to improve the description of the structure and gives access to the electronic properties of amorphous @xmath0 ( @xmath2-@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) simulation allows to study dynamical properties of the system within dft@xcite . during the nuclear dynamics ,",
    "the wavefunction remain sufficiently close to the born - oppenheimer surface allowing a faithful description of the electronic structure in most standard situation",
    ". however , the treatment of the dynamics of disordered systems in an ab - inito way is extremely costly from a computational point of view .",
    "this imposes restrictions to the size of the systems that can be studied and on the maximum lenght of the trajectory that can be calculated in a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the lenght of the trajectory that can be obtained within the car - parrinello method ( cpmd ) @xcite is of the order of picoseconds . in order to overcome these limitations different simulation strategies",
    "have been adopted in the past that combine the advantages of classical dynamics and the accuracy of an ab initio description . among these , the methodology exemplified in a paper by ginhoven et al .",
    "@xcite has been validated in a very accurate way . through the comparison of several combinations of classical and density functional schemes ,",
    "the authors show that small systems of @xmath2-@xmath0 ( under 100 atoms ) exibhit local structural characteristics that are similar to those of larger systems @xcite .",
    "benoit et al .",
    "@xcite use classical molecular dynamics for annealing small samples at very high temperatures ( above @xmath3 ) , quench the liquid up to a glassy transition , and then refine their analysis with a cpmd dynamics run followed by cpmd quenching to find a minimum energy structure",
    ". however , the work of benoit et al . still leaves space for improvement . in this paper",
    "we propose an enhanced protocol based on the same philosophy , but with a few important differences .",
    "first of all we use an improved classical potential , suitable for high temperature phases .",
    "subsequently , our cpmd quenching protocol , particularly suited for the amorphous samples of small size shows to be more efficient than the one used in the past . finally , we provide an interesting insight into the ring analysis by doing energetical considerations that should help to assess the validity of amorphous samples generated with this method .",
    "this work shows how to efficently generate small systems that still well represent the properties of infinite sized samples .",
    "the procedure described in this paper reduces the amount of cpu time required for the generation of @xmath2-@xmath0 by about a factor of five with respect to @xcite without compromising the final results .",
    "the properties of these system models are in good agreement with fully ab initio model systems and with available experimental data .",
    "our starting model was a slightly deformed cell of 72 atoms in the solid @xmath4-quartz phase .",
    "we adopted periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in all directions in order to mimic the bulk behavior .",
    "the pbc scheme allows to reduce finite size effects as well as surface effects and to get realistic properties with a small simulation cell .",
    "the model of the amorphous phase @xmath2-@xmath0 was obtained by first melting the quartz cells and then quenching from the melt using classical molecular dynamics with step cooling from @xmath5 to @xmath6 k at a quenching rate of @xmath7 k / s ( see section iii ) .",
    "we then relaxed the obtained configurations using the formalism of dft .",
    "+ the classical md calculations were performed using the moldy package @xcite .",
    "the long range electrostatic forces were treated using the ewald technique @xcite .",
    "we classically modeled the interaction between atoms using the empirical potential introduced by van beest et al .",
    "( bks ) @xcite which has been shown to properly describe the structural and dynamical properties of amorphous silica .",
    "this potential is a two body interaction consisting of a coulomb term and a short range term cast in the usual buckingham form .",
    "only two short range interactions are taken into account : the si - o interaction which describes the silica bond and the o - o non bonded interaction which causes the tetrahedal arrangement of oxygen atoms around the silicon atom . at short distances the bks potential diverges attractively limiting its use in molecular dynamics runs at high temperature ( in our case above 3700 k ) . in order to avoid this divergence at short distances",
    "we add a repulsive term @xcite .",
    "this modification is necessary to describe the high temperature liquid where ions of opposite charges would otherwise approach each other very closely and be trapped in the well of the coulomb potential .",
    "the functional form of the potential adopted in the classical simulations is therefore : @xmath8 where the first three terms represent the standard bks potential and the last two terms the correction introduced to avoid the divergence at short distances .",
    "the force field parameters for the bks potential are reported in table i. in table ii we report the coefficients of the correction terms applied and in fig .",

    "among all the generated @xmath0 model systems we selected the model-4 which best satisfied our criteria for a detailed study .",
    "this choice has been performed on the basis of the ring analysis of the previous section , but further analysis has to be performed to validate this finite size sample . the most natural way to further estimate the quality of the generated amorphous model systems is to analyze their structural characteristics such as bond lenghts and angle distributions , radial distribution functions , static structure factors and to compare them to available experimental data .",
    "we evaluated all these properties for the system called model-4 . at @xmath10 k",
    "we have calculated the time - averaged distributions of the intra - tetrahedral o - si - o and inter - tetrahedral si - o - si angles for the classical and quantum md simulations using the same starting configuration ( fig .",

    "the only difference between the classical and quantum simulation of the angle distibutions is a small shift of the mean value of the intra - tetrahedral si - o - si angle .",
    "we estimated for this angle a mean value of 152@xmath11 @xmath12 11@xmath11 for the classical averaged configurations and 146@xmath11 @xmath12 6@xmath11 for the car - parrinello microcanonical run ( nve ) ( the experimental value being 140@xmath11 - 150@xmath11@xcite ) .",
    "we noticed that this change in angle takes place during the first steps of the car - parrinello run corresponding to an extremely short sampling time ( @xmath13 0.07 ps ) .",

    "is found to be 1.65@xmath16 , which is slightly ( 3@xmath17 ) larger than the experimental value ( 1.61@xmath16 ) , in agreement with a general tendency of the gga @xcite . using the same computational setup we found a similar overstimation in a preliminary test made on @xmath4-quartz .",
    "for the other peaks we found 3.18@xmath16 for si - si and 2.68@xmath16 for the o - o bond lenght .",
    "+ from this analysis we concluded that our classical systems were well equilibrated . from the pair correlation functions we computed the static structure factor for the car - parrinello run which can be compared with experiments @xcite . experimentally the static structure factor can be obtained from neutron diffraction . in the simulations one possibility is to compute the static structure factor @xmath18 by its relation to the pair correlation function @xmath19 :    @xmath20    with    @xmath21}{\\bigg[\\sum_{\\alpha}c_{\\alpha}b_{\\alpha}\\bigg]^{2 } } \\label{matto}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the integral in eq.([sq ] ) has been evaluated by using the filon s method @xcite . in equation ( [ sq ] )",
