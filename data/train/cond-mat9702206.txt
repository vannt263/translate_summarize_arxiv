    "a number of studies of high-@xmath2 superconductors show that cuprate superconductors have a short coherence length , comparable to the average distance between doped holes .",
    "while this observation casts doubt on the applicability of the bcs model , the limit of local pairs is not a good description of the cuprates either , as the existence of a fermi surface demonstrates .",
    "a more appropriate model of a superconductor with medium - size cooper pairs should feature both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom at low energies .",
    "in a fermi liquid , the propagator of a pair with total momentum @xmath3 has a cut along the real axis of frequency @xmath4 ( from the continuum of free two - fermion states ) and two poles in the unphysical part of the complex @xmath4 plane .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the poles approach the real axis in the well - known @xcite way : @xmath5 . at @xmath6 , these bound states become stable excitations with zero energy and thus immediately undergo bose condensation .    to see why stable cooper pairs in a fermi liquid _ necessarily _ have zero energy , consider the dynamical balance between free fermions and bound states at @xmath3 . two free fermions with opposite momenta and equal energies",
    "@xmath7 form a bound state with energy @xmath8 at a rate @xmath9 proportional to the fermion occupation numbers @xmath10 and the density of states ( dos ) : @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the dissociation rate is @xmath12 ^ 2 $ ] , with the same prefactor ( by virtue of the time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "the balance @xmath13 is achieved when @xmath14 , hence @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is also when the dos vanishes in some interval of energies @xmath17 . in this case , however , a stable bound state can be formed at _ any _ real energy in the interval @xmath18 and the condensation is not imminent . in the bcs model ,",
    "the origin of the energy gap is scattering of fermions from the condensate of pairs , hence first the pairs condense and then the gap opens up .",
    "however , when the pair decay is slow ( just above @xmath2 ) , scattering from these long - lived resonances should already start to modify the fermion spectrum .",
    "this observation demonstrates that the question `` which comes first , the stable pairs or the gap ? '' has no simple answer beyond the mean - field treatment .",
    "quasistable pairs can produce a pseudogap , in which they might live long enough ; if their energy is non zero , they will not form a condensate .",
    "the bcs model is an idealization that is realized when the fermi sea is robust against the formation of a gap by almost stable cooper pairs .",
    "note that the bcs approach is justified only _ a posteriori _",
    "( the ginzburg criterion ) , when the spectrum of its fluctuations is found .",
    "it would be most advantageous to have a similarly idealized picture for the opposite limit , when creation of stable pairs precedes their condensation .",
    "we also want to stay with a predominantly fermionic system , _ not _ a collection of hard - core bosons that arises in the limit of fatally strong attraction between fermions . whether this idealization describes any real superconductors ( _ e.g. , _ underdoped cuprates ) is a separate question .",
    "some of the features of such an ideal system can be readily anticipated .",
    "the fact that cooper pairs have non - zero energies and momenta means that each fermion state is no longer coupled to a single hole state ( by the scattering process `` fermion @xmath19 pair + hole '' ) , but rather to a continuum of hole states .",
    "for this reason , fermions have a finite lifetime and the gap is smeared into a pseudogap .",
    "nevertheless , if the dos vanishes in the middle of the pseudogap , low - energy cooper pairs will be almost stable .",
    "the thermal energy of a boson must be small compared to the gap width @xmath1 , which itself should not exceed the fermi energy @xmath20 .",
    "we thus define a _ pseudogap regime _ : @xmath21",
    "the coupling of a fermion to a continuum of holes creates a computational problem .",
    "its physical consequence is broadening of fermion energy levels of order @xmath22 .",
    "if , however , there is another mechanism producing a far stronger broadening , the former effect can be neglected for _ some _ purposes .",
    "specifically , we neglect the slight difference between the 4-momenta of the fermion and the hole , which simplifies the problem dramatically . by doing so",
    ", we slightly violate the conservation of energy and momenta , which may lead to serious errors in computing transport properties but has little influence on the fermion propagator .",
    "such broadening can be caused by the pairing field with a fluctuating amplitude @xmath1 that shifts the energy of a fermion from a bare value @xmath7 to @xmath23 .",
    "amplitude fluctuations of order @xmath1 result in the width of order @xmath24 for low - energy fermion levels .",
    "this idea can be illustrated by a model in which fermions are coupled to an external pairing field @xmath25 obeying gaussian statistics : @xmath26 when temporal and spatial fluctuations of @xmath25 are neglected , @xmath27 , the problem admits an exact solution @xcite .",
    "low - energy fermion excitations have the linewidth of order @xmath1 .",
    "the dos exhibits a pseudogap of width @xmath1 and vanishes quadratically at low energies .",
    "the pseudogap regime ( [ pseudogap regime ] ) may be realized in quasi two - dimensional superconductors with moderately weak attraction between fermions , where @xmath2 is reduced substantially below the bcs value @xmath29 .",
    "( we do not consider here the possibility of a kosterlitz - thouless transition . )",
    "we have studied the pseudogap regime in @xmath30 dimensions using the self - consistent t - matrix approach @xcite , which readily permits introduction of a propagator for cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the resulting set of diagrams for the fermion propagator is similar to the gaussian model of the previous section , but without crossing boson lines . a smaller number of diagrams leads to a weaker suppression of the fermion states , @xmath31 at low energies ; otherwise , the dos has a similar structure .    inside the pseudogap ,",
    "long - lived cooper pairs have the dispersion of a bogoliubov mode with a mass , which prevents their condensation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 . the mass term @xmath34 is determined self - consistently to match the pseudogap width with the average fluctuation of the pairing field .",
    "in terms of the fermion density @xmath35 and mass @xmath36 , the resulting condensation temperature is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the condensation temperature of an ideal bose gas with density @xmath39 and mass @xmath40 .",
