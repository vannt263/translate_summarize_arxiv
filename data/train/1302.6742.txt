    "self - interest often leads to freeloading on the contributions of others in the dynamics associated with common goods and joint enterprises [ 1,2 ] .",
    "as is well known , incentivization , such as rewarding and punishing , is a popular method for harnessing the selfish action and for motivating individuals to behave cooperatively [ 313 ] .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies on joint enterprises under various incentive schemes are growing [ 1422 ] .",
    "obviously , whether rewards or penalties , sufficiently large incentives can transform freeloaders into full cooperators , and incentives with small impact do nothing on the outcomes [ 22 ] .",
    "however , incentivizing is costly , and such heavy incentives often incurs serious costs on those who provide the incentives , whether in a peer - to - peer or institutional manner .",
    "previous game - theoretic studies on the evolution of cooperation with incentives have focused on public good games with compulsory participation , and revealed that the intermediate degrees of punishment lead to a couple of stable equilibria , full defection and full cooperation [ 4,5,10,13,22,23 ] . in this bi - stable dynamic ,",
    "establishing full cooperation requires an initially sufficient fraction of cooperators , or ex ante adjustment to overcome the initial condition [ 10,23 ] .",
    "this situation is a coordination game [ 24 ] , which is a model of great interest for analyzing a widespread coordination problem ( e.g. , in choosing distinct technical standards ) .",
    "in contrast to a traditional case with compulsory participation , another approach to the evolution of cooperation is an option to opt out of joint enterprises [ 2537 ] .",
    "the opting - out option can make the freeloader problem relaxed : individuals can exit a joint venture when stuck in a state in which all freeload off one another ( `` economic stalemate '' ) , and then pursue a stand - alone project ; if a joint venture with mutual cooperation is more profitable than in isolation , the individuals once exited will switch to contributing to the venture .",
    "this situation , however , will also find defection attractive . thus , joint enterprises with optional participation can give rise to a rock - paper - scissors cycle [ 2831 ] .",
    "recently , sasaki _ et al .",
    "_ [ 22 ] revealed that considering optional participation as well as institutional incentives can effect fully cooperative outcomes for the intermediate ranges of incentives .",
    "they demonstrated that opting - out combined with rewarding is not very effective at establishing full cooperation , but opting - out combined with punishment is very effective at establishing cooperation .",
    "although there are a series of existing papers on the interplay of punishment and opting - out mechanisms [ 3844 ] , the main points of these earlier studies comprise solving the puzzling issue of second - order freeloading : the exploitation of the efforts of others to uphold incentives for cooperation [ 2 , 4 , 7 , 45 , 46 ] .",
    "[ 22 ] consider incentives controlled exclusively by a centralized authority ( like the empire or state ) [ 4750 ] , and thus , their model is already free from the second - order freeloader problem .",
    "here we analytically provide a full classification of the replicator dynamics in a public good game with institutional incentives and optional participation .",
    "we clarify when and how cooperation can be selected over defection in a bi - stable situation associated with institutional punishment without requiring any ability to communicate among individuals .",
    "in particular , assuming that the penalties are large enough to cause bi - stability with both full cooperation and full defection ( no matter what the basins of attraction are ) in cases of compulsory participation , cooperation will necessarily become selected in the long term , regardless of the initial conditions .",
    "to describe our institutional - incentive model , we start from public good games with group size @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1 players in a group are given the opportunity to participate in a public good game .",
    "we assume that participation pays a fixed entrance fee @xmath2 to the sanctioning institution , whereas non - participation yields nothing .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the number of players who are willing to participate ( @xmath4 ) and assume that at least two participants are required for the game to occur [ 28,3942 ] .",
    "if the game does take place , each of the @xmath3 participants in the group can decide whether to invest a fixed amount @xmath5 into a common pool , knowing that each contribution will be multiplied by @xmath6 and then shared equally among all @xmath7 _ other _ participants in the group .",
    "thus , participants have no direct gain from their own investments [ 6,4143,45 ] .",
    "if all of the participants invest , they obtain a net payoff @xmath8 .",
    "the game is a social dilemma , which is independent of the value of @xmath9 , because participants can improve their payoffs by withholding their contribution .",
    "let us next assume that the total incentive stipulated by a sanctioning institution is proportional to the group size @xmath3 and hence of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ( potential ) per capita incentive . if rewards are employed to incentivize cooperation , these funds will be shared among the so - called `` cooperators '' who contribute ( see [ 51 ] for a voluntary reward fund ) .",
    "hence , each cooperator will obtain a bonus that is denoted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the number of cooperators in the group of @xmath3 participants .",
    "if penalties are employed to incentivize cooperation , `` defectors '' who do not contribute will analogously have their payoffs reduced by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the number of defectors in the group of @xmath3 players ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we consider an infinitely large and well - mixed population of players , from which n samples are randomly selected to form a group for each game .",
    "our analysis of the underlying evolutionary game is based especially on the replicator dynamics [ 52 ] for the three corresponding strategies of the cooperator , defector , and non - participant , with respective frequencies @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . the combination of all possible values of @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 forms the triangular state space @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by c , d , and n the three vertices of @xmath23 that correspond to the three homogeneous states in which all cooperate ( @xmath24 ) , defect ( @xmath25 ) , or are non - participants ( @xmath26 ) , respectively . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the replicator dynamics are defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the average payoff in the entire population ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denote the expected payoff values for cooperators , defectors , and non - participants , respectively ; and @xmath32 is used to specify one of three different incentive schemes , namely , `` without incentives , '' `` with rewards , '' and `` with punishment , '' respectively . because non - participants have a payoff of 0 , @xmath33 , and thus , @xmath34 .",
    "we note that if @xmath35 , the three edges of the state space @xmath36 form a heteroclinic cycle without incentives : n @xmath37 c @xmath37 d @xmath37 n ( figs .",
    "2a or 3a ) .",
    "defectors dominate cooperators because of the cost of contribution @xmath38 , and non - participants dominate defectors because of the cost of participation @xmath39 . finally , cooperators dominate non - participants because of the net benefit from the public good game with @xmath35 . in the interior of @xmath23 ,",
    "all of the trajectories originate from and converge to n , which is a non - hyperbolic equilibrium .",
    "hence , cooperation can emerge only in brief bursts , sparked by random perturbations [ 29,41 ] .      here",
    ", we calculate the average payoff for the whole population and the expected payoff values for cooperators and defectors . in a group with @xmath7 co - participants ( @xmath40 ) , a defector or a cooperator obtains from the public good game an average payoff of @xmath41 [ 41 ] .",

    ", we considered replicator dynamics along the three edges of the state space @xmath23 . on the dn - edge ( @xmath58 ) , this dynamic is always d @xmath37 n because the payoff for non - participating is better than that for defecting by at least the participation fee @xmath39 , regardless of whether penalties versus rewards are in place . on the nc - edge ( @xmath59 ) , it is obvious that if the public good game is too expensive ( i.e. , if @xmath60 , under penalties or @xmath61 , under rewards ) , players will opt for non - participation more than cooperation . indeed , n becomes a global attractor because @xmath62 holds in @xmath63 .",

    "cooperation evolves in different ways under penalties versus rewards , as follows . under penalties ( fig .",
    "1a ) , as @xmath36 crosses the threshold @xmath73 , c becomes stable , and an unstable interior equilibrium r splits off from c. the point r separates the basins of attraction of c and d. penalties cause bi - stable competition between cooperators and defectors , which is often exhibited as a coordination game [ 24 ] ; one or the other norm will become established , but there can be no coexistence . with increasing @xmath36 , the basin of attraction of d becomes increasingly smaller , until @xmath36 attains the value of @xmath74 . here , r merges with the formerly stable d , which becomes unstable .",
    "in contrast , under rewards ( fig .",
    "1b ) , as @xmath36 crosses a threshold @xmath73 , d becomes unstable , and a stable interior equilibrium r splits off from d. the point r is a global attractor .",
    "rewards give rise to the stable coexistence of cooperators and defectors , which is a typical result in a snowdrift game [ 53 ] .",

    "we considered a model for the evolution of cooperation through institutional incentives and analyzed in detail evolutionary game dynamics .",
    "specifically , based on a public good game with optional participation , we fully analyzed how opting - opt impacts game dynamics ; in particular , opting - out can completely relax a coordination problem associated with punishment for a considerably broader range of parameters than in cases of compulsory participation .",
    "we start from assuming that there is a state - like institution that takes exclusive control of individual - level sanctions in the form of penalties and rewards . in our extended model",
    ", nobody is forced to enter a joint enterprise that is protected by the institutional sanctioning , however , whoever is willing to enter , must be charged at the entrance .",
    "further , if one proves unable or unwilling to pay , the sanctioning institution can ban that person from participation in the game . indeed ,",
    "joint ventures in real life are mostly protected by enforceable contracts in which members can freely participate , but are bound by a higher authority .",
    "for example , anyone can opt to not participate in a wedding vow ( with donating to the temple or church ) , but once it is taken , it is the strongest contract among enforceable contracts . as far as we know",
    ", such higher authorities always demand penalties if contracts are broken .    based on our mathematical analysis",
    ", we argue that institutional punishment , rather than institutional rewards , can become a more viable incentivization scheme for cooperation when combined with optional participation .",
    "we show that combining optional participation with rewards can complicate the game dynamics , especially if there is an attractor with all three strategies : cooperation , defection , and non - participation , present .",
    "this can only marginally improve group welfare for a small range of per capita incentive @xmath36 , with @xmath209 ( fig .",
    "3b ) . within this interval ,",
    "compulsory participation can lead to partial cooperation ; however , optional participation eliminates the cooperation and thus drives a population into a state in which all players exit .",
    "hence , freedom of participation is not a particularly effective way of boosting cooperation under a rewards scenario .    under penalties ,",
    "the situation varies considerably .",
    "indeed , as soon as @xmath210 ( fig .",
    "2b ) , the state in which all players cooperate abruptly turns into a global attractor for optional participation .",
    "when @xmath36 just exceeds @xmath73 , group welfare becomes maximum @xmath211 .",
    "meanwhile , for compulsory participation , almost all of the ( boundary ) state space between cooperation and defection still belongs to the basin of attraction of the state in which all players defect . because @xmath212 , where @xmath1 is the group size , and @xmath38 is the net contribution cost ( a constant ) , when @xmath1 is larger , the minimal institutional sanctioning cost @xmath73 to establish full cooperation is smaller .",
    "there are various approaches to equilibrium selection in @xmath1-person coordination games for binary choices [ 5456 ] . a strand of literature bases stochastic evolution models [ 5759 ] , in which typically , a `` risk - dominant '' equilibrium [ 60 ] that has the larger basin of attraction is selected through random fluctuation in the long run . in contrast , considering optional participation",
    ", our model typically selects the cooperative equilibrium which provides the higher group welfare , even if the cooperative equilibrium has the smaller basin of attraction when participation is compulsory than has the defective equilibrium . in the sense of favoring the efficient equilibrium , our result is similar to that found in a decentralized partner - changing model proposed by oechssler [ 61 ] , in which players may occasionally change interaction groups .    throughout centralized institutional sanctions",
    "mentioned so far , norm - based cooperation is less likely to suffer from higher - order freeloaders , which have been problematic in modeling decentralized peer - to - peer sanctions [ 2,62 ] .",
    "in addition , it is clear that sanctioning institutions will stipulate a lesser antisocial punishment targeted at cooperators [ 63 ] , which can prevent the evolution of pro - social behaviors ( [ 64,65 ] , see also [ 36 ] ) . indeed , punishing cooperators essentially promote defectors , who will reduce the number of participants willing to pay for social institutions . for self - sustainability , thus , sanctioning institutions should dismiss any antisocial schemes that may lead to a future reduction in resources for funding the institution .",
    "thus , we find that our model reduces the space of possible actions into a very narrow framework of alternative strategies , in exchange for increasing the degree of the institution s complexity and abstractiveness . in practice , truly chaotic situations which offer a very long list of possibilities are unfeasible and create inconvenience , as is described by michael ende in `` _ the prison of freedom _ '' [ 1992 ] .",
    "participants in all economic experiments usually can make their meaningful choices only in a short and regulated list of options , as is the way with us in real life .",
    "our result indicates that a third party capable of exclusively controlling incentives and membership can play a key role in selecting a cooperative equilibrium without ex ante adjustment .",
    "the question of how such a social order can emerge out of a world of chaos is left entirely open .",
    "we thank ke brnnstrm , ulf dieckmann , and karl sigmund for their comments and suggestions on an earlier version of this paper .",
    "this study was enabled by financial support by the fwf ( austrian science fund ) to ulf dieckmann at iiasa ( tect i-106 g11 ) , and was also supported by grant rfp-12 - 21 from the foundational questions in evolutionary biology fund .",
    "first , we prove that a homoclinic loop that originates from and converges to q does not exist . using the poincar - bendixson theorem [ 52 ] and the uniqueness of an interior equilibrium ,",
    "we show that if it does exist , there must be a point @xmath213 inside the loop such that both of its @xmath172- and @xmath214-limit sets include q. this contradicts the fact that q is a saddle point .",
    "indeed , there may be a section that cuts through q such that the positive and negative orbits of @xmath213 infinitely often cross it ; however , it is impossible for a sequence consisting of all the crossing points to originate from and also converge to the saddle point q. hence , there is no homoclinic orbit of q.    next , we show that orbits that form the unstable manifold of q do not converge to the same equilibrium ( indeed , this is a sink ) .",
    "if they do , the closed region that is surrounded by the orbits must include a point @xmath215 such that its @xmath214-limit set is q. using the poincar - bendixson theorem and the uniqueness of an interior equilibrium , the @xmath172-limit set for @xmath215 must include q ; this is a contradiction .",
    "similarly , we can prove that the orbits that form the stable manifold of q do not issue from the same equilibrium .",

    "<S> the global stability of coercion - based cooperation in this optional case contrasts strikingly with the bi - stability that is observed in the compulsory case . </S>",
