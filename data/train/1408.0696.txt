    "the rapid growth of population in the united states has produced a sharp rise in the consumption of food , water , and electricity . based on this increase in the population",
    ", governmental authorities are turning to renewable energy sources for solutions  @xcite .",
    "additionally , private corporations have understood the necessity for clean renewable energy , and have invested time and capital into developing efficient methods of producing electricity from renewable sources , one of the most promising of which is solar energy .",
    "the first solid state solar cell , built in 1883 by charles edgar fritts , successfully demonstrated that sunlight could be used as a viable energy source but was highly inefficient as less than one percent of the absorbed light was transformed into electric current  @xcite .",
    "the technology has advanced , and today photovoltaic solar cells are efficient sources of providing power  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we analyze the complex interactions between households that use solar power and those that do not , specifically at the effects of social influence on these interactions . with more households using solar technology",
    ", the population can become less reliant on coal and other `` unclean '' sources , thus decreasing the emissions of harmful chemicals that cause pollution .",
    "we include a framework for study of the significance of government subsidies and the subsequent effects on the system .",
    "our goal is to examine how solar panel adoption is affected by social influence and how the technology can spread across a population over time .",
    "the spread of new technologies through populations and the importance of social influence to consumer decision making has been well - documented  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the amount of influence felt by the individual consumer grows in proportion to the size of the referent peer group  @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported that some consumers buy environmentally conscious products in order to increase social status  @xcite .",
    "marketers from different industries utilize socially conscious advertisements to capitalize on this behavior  @xcite .",
    "since rooftop solar panels are a prominent feature on a house , their visibility intensifies the effects of peer interactions  @xcite .",
    "social influence has been similarly examined in other scenarios , such as predicting voting behavior  @xcite and the spread of mobile phone technology  @xcite .",
    "we aim to quantify and analyze the impact of this type of social influence on the spread of solar panel technology .    ) and solar power user households ( @xmath0 ) . _ _ ]    we develop a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the dynamics between electricity consuming households in a theoretical population , as shown in the compartmental model , see figure  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the population is compartmentalized by household according to their primary energy source into a non - solar power class @xmath1 , solar power through a community block @xmath2 , solar power through leasing @xmath3 , and solar power through buying @xmath4 solar panels .",
    "we assume that non - users of solar power ( the @xmath5 class ) receive their power from coal - fired generation , which currently accounts for more than half of the electricity produced in america  @xcite .",
    "utility companies operate externally located solar panel farms , from which they transport power to households of subscribers to the community block option . as such , for an extra monthly fee",
    ", the community block allows residents the use of clean energy without having to install a rooftop solar panel system .",
    "it also allows for households to opt for or out of the program and receive non - solar powered electricity with minimal effort  @xcite .",

    "we construct a sensitivity index for each of the parameters that determine @xmath6 , shown in table  [ tab : sensitivity ] . for each parameter @xmath7 , the sensitivity index @xmath8 , which represents the normalized change in @xmath6 caused by a small change in @xmath7  @xcite , is given by : @xmath9",

    "we use a uniform distribution to generate random parameter values and plot solution curves for each set of values .",
    "the results can be seen in figures  [ fig : spaghettiu]-  [ fig : spaghettiy ] .",
    "the @xmath5 class shows the least amount of variation over time .",
    "the point at which its distribution is the widest is around the seven year mark .",
    "after that point the solution curves are grouped within the @xmath10 $ ] interval .",
    "the relatively low variation among the 100 iterations of solution curves indicates that the estimates of the @xmath5 class are fairly reliable given the uncertainty in the parameter estimation .",
    "the solar classes have relatively wide distributions over time , with most of their curves tending toward nonzero levels .",
    "figures  [ fig : spaghettiu]-  [ fig : spaghettiy ] indicate that variation in the model s parameters has a significant influence on the final distribution among the solar classes , while the non - solar class tends to exhibit similar behavior even for various sets of parameter values .",
    "we note also that there is greater variation in the final distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 when compared with the variation in the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates that given the uncertainty in our parameter estimates , the estimates of the size of the non - user and community block classes are likely to be more reliable than the estimates of the leasing or buying classes .",
    "we may conclude that accurate estimation of the relevant parameters is of critical importance if this model is to be applied to the design of policy .",
    "the widespread use of solar power has significant implications for society at large . the current electrical grid , fragile and overburdened , will benefit tremendously from increased use of solar power .",
    "widespread power outages currently represent a significant cause of economic loss  @xcite .",
    "since at least some of their energy consumption is covered by a localized source , households with their own solar panels are less reliant on the centralized grid system , so they are not as harshly affected by power outages  @xcite",
    ".    the benefits of solar power will extend to those who do not use it .",
    "households can send the excess power generated by their solar panels back to the utility company , thus reducing the load on the power grid .",
    "this also helps in reducing pollution produced from using other power sources such as coal , which currently provides over half of the electricity consumed in the united states  @xcite .",
    "coal produces high levels of pollution , which has associated economic costs  @xcite .",
    "in addition to environmental harm , medical conditions such as lung cancer and heart attacks , which are leading causes of death in america , have been linked to coal pollution  @xcite .",
    "solar power is a clean energy source that causes relatively little environmental harm in its production or use  @xcite .",
    "increased usage of solar power could therefore contribute to a healthier population and possibly even lower death rates in areas where coal is a primary source of power .",
    "we have considered a model in which the environmental concerns of the early adopters and social pressure are the only relevant factors prompting individuals to switch to solar power .",
    "it seems logical that any capital put into ad campaigns or incentives would serve to compound the effects of social influence .",
    "for very small values of @xmath14 , there may be a situation in which the threshold is not surpassed , but could be overcome with added effort from authorities and utility providers . after a certain level of the population has adopted the technology , social pressure alone may be enough to sustain the trend .",
    "this observation is important to the authorities responsible for making decisions regarding our energy sources . in our simulations",
    ", we observed the population of the non - solar class always tended to a small fraction of the total population , but was still subject to a certain amount of variation .",
    "therefore , future study could examine the amount of money spent on maximizing the number of households that adopt solar technology .",

    "@xmath26 that is : @xmath27      we attempted to study the effects of government subsidies and the corresponding response of pollution levels on the existence of solar panels over time .",
    "amount of pollution @xmath28 is quantified by the following function : @xmath29 the function is bounded between @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath30 corresponds to the minimum amount of pollution and @xmath31 to the maximum of pollution . for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which implies that when there are no households using coal , the population produces no pollution . when @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which suggests that when the entire population is using coal , pollution is at the highest possible level",
    ". thus we can view @xmath28 as the amount of pollution that a population can produce , dependent on the proportion of households using coal .",
    "the federal government , in an indirect effort to control pollution , provides subsidies and other incentives to households that buy solar panels .",
    "when the level of pollution changes , the government responds by changing the amount of subsidies accordingly .",
    "the population s reaction , depending on the direction of the subsidies change , is either for more households to buy solar panels or for less households to buy solar panels .",
    "this in turn affects the pollution levels . in order to incorporate this feedback into the model we make @xmath14 , the rate at which households move into the solar panel classes , dependent on the amount of pollution :",
    "@xmath36 note that since @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the choice of this @xmath14 function is motivated by the need for a smooth positive increasing function whose first derivative decreases as @xmath28 approaches @xmath31 .",
    "we need the first derivative to be decreasing since as the amount of pollution produced increases , we expect that the rate of households switching to solar would increase rapidly at first , and then level off as the amount of pollution reaches saturation .",
    "we represent the amount of subsidies @xmath39 through the following , as a function of the buyer class @xmath12 : + @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the average per household amount spent by the government on a subsidy , @xmath42 is the rate of people flowing from @xmath5 to @xmath12 , and @xmath43 is the total number of households in the population .      in this study we attempted to implement a stochastic version of our model with the gillespie algorithm .",
    "our motivation for this was to determine a projection for the likely amount of solar users over time given realistic conditions .",
    "when the stochastic model was created we found that the output did not give realistic results .",
    "we found that in the first time step a majority of non - solar panel households moved into solar classes .",
    "this behavior is not realistic since one time step represents one year .",
    "initially we thought that this behavior was a result of an error in our implementation of the gillespie algorithm .",
    "but after close inspection we found that the rate of households moving from non - solar to solar classes completely dominated the other rates .",
    "also , since we were using a relatively large total population , events occurred very frequently .",
    "the combination of these two conditions drive most households from non - solar to solar classes very fast .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is nothing wrong with our model , or our implementation of the gillespie algorithm , but that the algorithm is inappropriate to use with our model . for future work",
    "we suggest a method that overcomes these obstacles , perhaps a discrete time markov chain in which the time steps are marked by one year ."
