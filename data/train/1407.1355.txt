    "the increasing levels of penetration of distributed generators ( dgs ) , either renewable or gas - fired will cause the distribution grids to operate in unconventional conditions .",
    "the flow of active or reactive power may become reversed in certain realistic situations such as sunny weekday time in residential areas with high penetration of photovoltaic panels .",
    "active participation of future distribution level power electronics in reactive power compensation may also lead to the local reversal of reactive power flows .",
    "these kind of operating conditions are not common to existing power grids , but may become more common in the future and may also have a serious effect on the overall voltage stability of the system .    the strong nonlinearities present in the power system determine the existence , multiplicity , and stability of the viable operating points @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear control loops inside individual system components are responsible for the voltage collapse @xcite and loss of synchrony phenomena @xcite that have caused some of the most severe blackouts in the recent history .",
    "generally , the power flow equations that are commonly used for the description of steady states of the power system @xcite may have multiple solutions @xcite , but in typical operating conditions , there always exists a high voltage solution that is considered a normal operating point @xcite .",
    "the power flow equations solutions manifold has been studied rather extensively in the context of transmission grids ; nevertheless , the structure of the solution manifold in distribution grids in reversed power flow regime is however poorly understood , although there are reasons to believe that it will be very different from the classical nose - curve type manifold .",
    "even though the direction of the power flow does not affect the qualitative properties of the solutions in linear ( dc power flow ) approximation , it becomes important when the nonlinearity is strong .",
    "the symmetry between the normal and reversed power flow solutions is broken because the losses that are the major cause of nonlinearity in the power flow equations are always positive . in traditional distribution grids",
    "the consumption of power and the losses have the same sign , while in the situation with reversed flows the processes of power injection and thermal losses are competing with each other .",
    "this competition may manifest itself in the appearance of new solutions of power flow equations that do not exist in the non - reversed power flow regime . from power engineering perspective , this phenomena can be understood with the following argument . in the presence of power flow reversal , the power injections raise the voltage to high enough levels for low voltage equilibria to appear .",
    "the existence of low voltage equilibria may be demonstrated by continuation type rigorous mathematical arguments , that we have presented in appendix [ app : newsol ] .",
    "it is also based on our observations from numerical simulations / experiments and the discussions of the existence of power flow problem presented in @xcite .",
    "this phenomena was observed by one of the authors in a recent work @xcite but has not been explored in greater details since then .    even for the traditional nose - curve scenario ,",
    "the second low voltage solution may be stable under some conditions .",
    "this has been recognized for a long time @xcite . moreover , venkatasubramanian et al . in @xcite",
    "noted that the situations in which the systems gets trapped at the second stable equilibrium have been observed .",
    "however , the relevance of the low voltage stable equilibrium did not draw much attention and/or has not been studied extensively because this stable equilibrium is neither viable nor convincingly verified numerically due to modeling difficulties .",
    "the main problem in the assessment of the stability is the highly complex nature of the load dynamics",
    ". the dynamic behavior of the loads are a result nonlinear interactions of millions of heterogeneous components that are poorly understood and not fully known to the operator of any given grid .",
    "at the same time , the dynamic behavior has a direct effect on the stability properties that can not be directly assessed via static power flow analysis @xcite . in this work",
    ", we address this problem by studying the stability with dynamic load models that are consistent with existing models in normal conditions but does not suffer from the convergence problems in abnormal situations .",
    "although , new equilibria are not suited to the normal operation of the power system , they may cause serious effects on the transient stability and post - fault recovery of the system .",
    "the effect is similar although more serious than the fault induced delayed voltage recovery ( fidvr ) observed in power grids with high share of induction motors in the load composition @xcite .",
    "stalling of induction motors may cause the delay in the restoration process . at the same time , when the grid has stable low voltage equilibria , the system may get entrapped and fail to escape from the equilibrium at all . in this case , the likely outcome of the dynamics will be the tripping action of the undervoltage protective relays and consequent partial outage of the power grid .",
    "hence , it is important to revisit the voltage protection controls for the future power grids with high penetration of distributed generation . in this work we proposed specific pulse emergency control strategies ( pecs ) that are designed to restore the system to the normal operating condition .",
    "the key contributions of this work are summarized below . in section [ sec : dynamic simulations 3 bus ] , we perform dynamic simulations on a three - bus model that illustrate the effect of multistability and possibility of system entrapment in undesirable low voltage states . the simulations illustrate both the stability of some regions of low voltage part of the nose curve as well as the effect of multistability at high load levels .",
    "next , in section [ sec : dynamic simulations 13 bus ] , we introduce a novel admittance homotopy power flow technique to find multiple solutions to the power flow equations , and perform dynamic simulations of a larger system , the ieee thirteen - bus test feeder .",
    "we dedicate section [ sec : emergencycontrol ] to revisit the current emergency control actions and design the pulse emergency control for multistability .",
    "the importance of proper power reversal regulations as well as the proper assessment of dg penetration level on planning stages is also discussed in the end of section [ sec : emergencycontrol ] .",
    "in this and the next section , we introduce the model and perform dynamic simulations of two radial networks to show that the two stable equilibria of load dynamics equations may coexist at the same time , and that the distribution system may become entrapped at the lower voltage equilibrium .",
    "first , we consider a three - bus network as shown in figure [ 3bus ] with bus @xmath1 being the slack bus and buses @xmath2 and @xmath3 representing the dynamic loads with distributed generation exporting reactive power .",
    "this system could represent the future distribution grids with the inverters of pv panels participating in voltage regulation ( see @xcite for further discussions of this proposal ) .",
    "alternatively , it could represent a highly capacitive grid , for example involving long underground cables .",
    "the loads are modeled as dynamic admittances with conductance @xmath4 and susceptance @xmath5 that evolve according to the following dynamic equations : @xmath6    @xmath7    the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe the static ( steady - state ) power characteristics of the loads that are achieved in equilibrium .",
    "this form of dynamic load model is consistent with the most common ones in normal operating conditions , but is also applicable to highly nonlinear transients .",
    "the traditional load models @xcite with time - varying power consumption levels may not have solutions in all the transient states , whereas the model based on local admittance levels always has solutions .",
    "we assume that the steady - state active and reactive power levels do not depend on the bus voltage , so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 depend only on time .",
    "in other words , the loads can be classified as constant power loads , that attempt to achieve the given power demand levels @xmath10 .",
    "this assumption is clearly a simplification of the real loads .",
    "however , it is a common assumption in most of the classical voltage stability studies , and also may be a good approximation of power systems with aggressive var compensation or power grids interconnected through fast voltage source converters ( vsc ) .",
    "moreover , the qualitative nature of the results does not depend on the specific static characteristic and more realistic models are used in next section .    in our simulations",
    ", we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 for the load at bus @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the load at bus @xmath3 .",
    "the actual values of time constants do not affect any stability properties , we chose them for convenience of presentation , but physically the fast dynamic loads could correspond to power electronics regulating the voltage levels on the consumer side .",
    "the network parameters are given as the following .",
    "the impedance of the line @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; the impedance of the line @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the load power consumption levels are defined as : @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; where @xmath21 is the load number , @xmath22 . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the active and reactive powers produced from distributed generators at bus @xmath21 , whereas , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the active and reactive powers consumed at bus @xmath21 .",
    "the power levels have negative values if the bus is generating power , whereas , positive values indicate that the bus is consuming power . hereafter , all simulations rely on the assumption that all components / devices are able to operate through short periods under low voltage conditions , and without disconnection to the grid . in other words ,",
    "all components / devices have enough low voltage ride through ( lvrt ) capabilities .",
    "this assumption holds when high levels of system reliability are enforced . in this case , we assume that dgs continue to export power in the post - fault recovery .    in this paper , we mainly focus on non - synchronous dgs , i.e. wind turbines and solar panels .",
    "these dgs can be modeled as either @xmath27 or @xmath28 bus by selecting corresponding control mode @xcite . as a common practice",
    ", dgs can be switched from constant voltage to constant reactive power output when reactive power limits are reached @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath27 model or in equivalent , a negative load equipped with integral controller ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 .",
    "the aggregated loads represent the combination of both the traditional consumption loads and dgs represented as negative loads . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assign a single time constant for the aggregated one .",
    "more sophisticated voltage control strategies may be explored in future more detailed studies . even though the existing standards for dgs integration do not allow them to control voltage , i.e. require them to maintain a unity power factor ; in the future , it is expected to change .",
    "the objective of our first scenario simulations is to demonstrate that the system may get entrapped in the stable low voltage equilibrium .",
    "the bus @xmath3 has base demand level @xmath31 and @xmath32 which corresponds to a capacitive load producing active power .",
    "the base active and reactive power demands of load @xmath2 are also given as @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "while keeping @xmath35 fixed to equal to the base level and changing the active demand level at bus @xmath13 , @xmath36 , we can plot different @xmath28 curves as in figure [ fig : voltagemultistability ] with two stable equilibria . in these plots ,",
    "the blue dot segments represent stable equilibria and the red dot segments - the unstable ones , all observed for different values of @xmath36 .",
    "the large blue dot represents the high voltage stable equilibrium , @xmath37 , and the large red one marks the low voltage one , @xmath38 . for the given parameters , the two stable equilibria , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , correspond to two levels of voltage at bus @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively",
    "the following scenario initiates the transition of the system from the high voltage equilibrium to the low voltage one .",
    "initially the system is operating at the high voltage equilibrium , @xmath37 . in the dynamic simulation",
    ", the preferred operating condition can be reached by choosing appropriate initial conditions in the neighborhood of the steady state . in this case , zero initial condition is suggested .",
    "the initial transient to the equilibrium point is shown in figure [ fig : p2v24000s_h2l ] following the blue arrows .",
    "after the system reaches the high voltage equilibrium , a large disturbance occurs , i.e. distributed generation is partially lost , at @xmath41 .",
    "for example it could represent the cloud covering the pv panels with a shadow or action of protective relays after a short - circuit .",
    "the aggregate load on bus @xmath2 changes its behavior from generation to consumption of active and reactive power . as a result ,",
    "the system starts to move away from the high voltage stable equilibrium , @xmath37 , and approach the low voltage one , @xmath38 .",
    "this process is presented in figure [ fig : p2v24000s_h2l ] with red arrows .",
    "the transient dynamics of the system dies out around @xmath42 .",
    "the same transient from the high voltage equilibrium to the low voltage equilibrium can be also observed in another system where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; @xmath48 for the load at bus @xmath13 and @xmath49 for the load at bus @xmath3 ; if a transient fault located at either bus @xmath2 or bus @xmath3 occurs at @xmath50 for a short time , e.g. @xmath51 .",
    "the conductance of the load at bus @xmath3 during the transient is shown in figure [ fig : shortcircuit ] .",
    "the high level and low level refer to the voltage level of the corresponding equilibrium .",
    "later , at @xmath52 the second disturbance in @xmath36 occurs that changes the demand @xmath36 to some higher value @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : p2v2ts_h2l ] , the system first moves away from the low voltage equilibrium following the blue arrows then returns back to the same equilibrium following the blue dashed arrows . our numerical experiments with several disturbances with different amplitudes and durations indicate that the low voltage equilibrium is indeed non - linearly stable and is characterized by the region of attraction with finite size .",
    "in this section , we study the multistability phenomenon and the transition among equilibria in a more realistic thirteen - bus radial system based on the ieee thirteen - bus distribution feeder test case described in @xcite .",
    "the network configuration is shown in figure [ fig:13busfeeder ] and the branch data can be found in table [ branchdata ] .",
    "if other active and reactive powers are non - zero such as @xmath55 , non - ideal short circuit is applied , i.e. short circuit via low impedance .",
    "non - ideal short circuit status is corresponding to very low voltage . when the solution branch is constructed with respect to @xmath56 ,",
    "the status of @xmath57 will change from open to s / c ; hence @xmath58 will change from @xmath59 to either @xmath60 or @xmath61 depending on the load consumes or produces power .",
    "as observed in @xmath62 curves in figure [ fig : p3v3s ] , all solution branches are either starting or ending at the origin of the plot which correspond to a zero power flow operating point .",
    "the key observation about the importance of the zero power flow operating point is the following .",
    "for any radial system with @xmath63 buses , it is possible to construct explicitly multiple different solutions of the power flow equations for the operating point where all of the power injections are zero .",
    "these solutions are constructed by either short circuiting or opening the circuit on every bus , as shown on the figure .",
    "as one can easily check the power flow in both of the configurations will be the same .",
    "so , for the system with @xmath64 @xmath27 buses we have @xmath65 possible solutions . not all of them are different , but the important point is that many solution branches pass through this point . however , as we will argue below , most of these branches can be naturally continued far into the power generation but not in the high - power consumption regime .",
    "typical new solution branches in consumption regimes are tiny and close to the origin of the @xmath28 plot , i.e. power transfer through the line to supply the load is limited compared to that in the production regimes . in other words , the solution branch can be usually continued into production regimes much further than in the consumption regimes .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "all the nose curves observed on the @xmath28 plot are continuations of the special configurations with open or short - circuited switches . consider a radial system where the bus @xmath66 is short - circuited , which means that all downstream buses with @xmath67 also have zero voltages .",
    "as continued from zero voltage level , the non - conventional solution branches will have very low voltage levels in the close neighborhood of no - loading point .",
    "hence , they will have much lower loadability limit in the consumption region due to high currents accompanied by high power losses .    on the other hand",
    ", the solution branches can be typically indefinitely continued in the reversed power regime .",
    "the reasoning behind this conjecture is the same as for the text - book 2-bus example consisting of one slack bus and one load bus .",
    "the load power can be expressed as @xmath68 .",
    "if the load consumes power , i.e. @xmath69 , current @xmath29 will be limited when @xmath70 increases because @xmath71 increases faster than @xmath72 . at the point where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the system encounters voltage collapse . however",
    ", this limit is removed in the production regimes where @xmath75 , the current @xmath29 can goes to infinity because power @xmath70 and the loss related term , @xmath76 , have the same sign .",
    "the maximum loading in the consumption regime occurs when the impedance of load and network become comparable ( equal in @xmath2-bus example ) , however this condition can never be satisfied for power flow reversal regime .",
