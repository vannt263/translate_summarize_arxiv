    "the formation and evolutionary pathways of dwarf galaxies are still not well - understood , despite the fact that they are fairly simple systems and are the most abundant type of galaxy in the universe .",
    "many studies have focused on the idea that dwarf galaxy evolution is driven by interactions and mergers , through ram pressure stripping , tidal disruption , or other external transformations .",
    "today , there are many well - established mechanisms to evolve dwarf galaxies in high density group and cluster environments .",
    "it has been more difficult to study the ongoing secular dwarf galaxy evolution in isolated environments where mergers and interactions have a smaller impact . in this regime ,",
    "star formation is the most transformative process a dwarf galaxy can undergo .",
    "the best places to study the transformative effects of star formation are in the dwarf galaxies with the highest star formation rates ( sfrs ) : the blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies are often broadly categorized as either dwarf irregulars ( dis ) which lack a regular morphology , possess substantial gas reservoirs , and are often forming stars , or as dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs , or dwarf ellipticals , des ) , which have regular isophotes , are gas - poor , and are not forming stars .",
    "bcds are classified in a variety of ways , but are observationally remarkable for their strong emission lines and star formation @xcite , their underlying old stellar population @xcite , their exceptionally low gas - phase metallicity @xcite , and their compact underlying stellar and hi distributions @xcite .",
    "some groups have hypothesized that a compact mass distribution is the most distinctive characteristic of a bcd @xcite .",
    "recently , many groups have used observations to study the evolutionary connections between bcds and other dwarf galaxies .",
    "detailed studies of individual extreme objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and systematic surveys of many objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have both suggested that bcds are members of a rapidly evolving class of galaxies , and play an important role in dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "deep surface photometry studies @xcite in addition to spectroscopic observations @xcite have highlighted the possible connections between bcds and dwarf irregulars in terms of their structural parameters and chemical evolution .",
    "other observations suggest that the unusually low metallicity of bcds is more likely maintained by outflows of enriched winds @xcite rather than pristine gas infall @xcite",
    ". there have also been efforts to find galaxies which may have experienced a bcd - like star formation event at some point in their history , or to predict the future evolutionary state of today s bcds @xcite .",
    "one of the big questions about bcds is the reason for their intense star formation , and whether they have been triggered in some way .",
    "there are well - studied examples where mergers or interactions between dis have externally triggered intense star formation ( e.g. , ii  zw  40 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , cosmologically - relevant hydrodynamical simulations are beginning to approach these questions from a theoretical perspective ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "while dwarf - dwarf galaxy mergers become increasingly rare at lower masses @xcite , some groups have had success in producing bcd - like galaxies through these interactions @xcite .",
    "others have considered the effects of in - spiraling star - forming clumps in dwarf galaxies @xcite , or the interaction between a dwarf galaxy and an infalling cloud of gas @xcite , both of which can reproduce some of the observed properties of bcds . both the merger and gas infall scenarios frequently result in substantial structural changes to the simulated galaxies , and represent extreme transformations in the life of a di . however , in this work we focus on the internal secular evolution of isolated bcds , and avoid discussing mergers and interactions .    compared with typical dis , bcds have been found to be especially compact , in their underlying stellar and hi distributions @xcite .",
    "this compactness may be related to their ability to host such intense starbursts .",
    "when parametrizing the strength of a star - forming event , the birthrate parameter ( @xmath0@xmath1sfr@xmath2@xmath3sfr@xmath4 , see section  [ bstrength ] ) is often used , which compares the current star formation with the lifetime average . in the local universe ,",
    "intense star - forming galaxies are rare as only @xmath5@xmath6 of star - forming galaxies are considered starbursts with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "when combining this rarity with the stochastic nature of star - formation in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it would appear that dwarf galaxies can experience increases and decreases in their star formation rate , and only a small fraction are starbursting at any given time .",
    "perhaps the especially - compact bcds are able to burst more effectively than typical dis , and so can reach higher sfr during their periods of starburst .    to compare the star formation properties and evolutionary history of bcds and dis from the local volume legacy survey ( lvl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider the wealth of information contained in their stellar populations .",
    "an understanding of these stellar populations can constrain the amount and impact of recent and past star - formation activity .",
    "we have obtained multi - wavelength photometry in order to fit the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the bcds and lvl galaxies . sed fitting has recently become a widely - used tool to derive physical properties of galaxies , including their stellar masses and star formation rates ( cf .",
    ".    given that stellar mass is often considered the most fundamental parameter driving a galaxy s evolutionary path ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , star forming galaxies are often plotted on a `` main sequence '' , analogously to the main sequence of stellar evolution .",
    "this correlation between the stellar masses and sfrs of star - forming galaxies has been observed for massive galaxies in the nearby universe @xcite and at higher redshift @xcite , with a scatter of only @xmath5@xmath8  dex .",
    "the fact that this relationship exists with such low scatter across a wide range of redshifts seems to imply a universal mode of star formation , from which galaxies rarely deviate @xcite . at smaller masses ( below @xmath9 m _ ) the scatter becomes larger , as episodic bursts of star formation can affect dwarf galaxies more significantly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    galaxy stellar masses are most commonly determined by converting observed luminosities to masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "often a color ( e.g. , b@xmath10v ) , is used to determine the mass - to - light ratio , but these estimates become less reliable for galaxies which deviate from mean scaling relations ( e.g. , if they are currently experiencing a starburst ) . in order to more uniformly determine stellar masses across our sample of bcds and lvl galaxies , a full multi - wavelength sed - fit is necessary .",
    "our sed fits can be also used to make crude estimates of the sfr and star formation histories ( sfhs ) for bcds and lvl galaxies , which describe the amount of star formation they experienced throughout their lifetimes .",
    "different observational indicators are sensitive to star formation of different ages , and the sed fits incorporate all of the multi - wavelength information into a single best fitting sfh . while the broadband photometry can never produce as accurate and well - constrained a sfh as resolved stellar photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it can still be useful in comparing bcds with typical lvl galaxies .",
    "in particular , the stellar masses and sfrs from the sed fits allow us to quantify how extreme the bcds are compared with typical lvl galaxies , and to constrain the possible evolutionary connections between bcds and other dwarf galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ obs ]",
    ", we describe the multi - wavelength photometric observations of the bcds and comparison samples . in section  [ cigale ]",
    "we discuss our sed - fitting methods and the consistency checks and verifications of our results . in section  [ sed_results ]",
    "we show the results of our best sed fits .",
    "section  [ sed_discussion ] contains a discussion of these results and their implications , and we briefly summarize our main findings in section  [ sed_summary ] .",

    "the lvl sample extends to significantly lower stellar masses than the sdss sample , and confirms that the star - forming main sequence relationship continues at least down to m@xmath116  @xmath5@xmath117 , although it may become broader at the lower masses .",
    "as seen in figure  [ msfr ] , regardless of whether sfr is measured via the 50-myr average from sed fits or from h@xmath26 fluxes , the m@xmath10sfr relationship for bcds is offset from that of normal galaxies . when considering sfr@xmath118 measurements , the bcds are more than an order of magnitude offset from the typical relationship , in the sense that bcds have @xmath5@xmath63 times more star formation per unit stellar mass .",
    "when using @xmath3sfr@xmath119 , the offset between the bcds and normal galaxies is smaller , but is still nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "regardless of the implicit assumptions in different sfr indicators , bcds show sfrs elevated above the star - forming `` main sequence '' , indicating that bcds are experiencing truly exceptional amounts of star formation . as their h@xmath26 sfrs",
    "are elevated beyond the sed sfrs ( based on uv fluxes ) , the current sf in bcds may also be especially recent .      to test whether the bcds or the lvl galaxies show any evidence of past bursts of star formation , we can compare the sfr estimates averaged over multiple time scales .",
    "evidence of past bursts would support the possibility that other dwarf galaxies may have experienced bcd - like star formation events , and may help to identify bcds which are no longer bursting .",

    "this sfr difference is calculated for the 50 , 100 , 500 , and 1000  myr time - averaged sfr estimates , and is shown in the panels of figure  [ dsfr ] .",

    "scales ( 1000  myr average sfr ) , the bcds show a much tighter distribution of differences than the lvl galaxies , possibly implying that bcds have had less variation in their star formation histories .",
    "alternatively , this lack of deviations may mean that their current star formation event has generated a substantial fraction of their total stellar mass .",
    "it is difficult to accurately compare these sfh indicators as they all have large uncertainties .",
    "+        in order to test whether the decreased scatter of the bcds in the sfr deviations of figure  [ dsfr ] means that the sfh in the bcds is dominated by a recent event , we compare sfr estimates in a different way .",
    "we subtract sfr estimates from two different time intervals and normalize the difference by the lifetime average sfr . for example , when comparing the 50  myr sfr estimate with the 10  myr estimate , the excess is found by : @xmath122 and indicates the relative intensity of sf activity in the interval between 10 and 50  myr ago , compared with the overall sfr .",
    "we calculate this quantity for four age - pairings , as shown in the panels of figure  [ dsfrd ] .",
    "it appears that the sfr excess on the shortest time scales ( between 50 and 10  myr ago , shown in figure  [ dsfrd]a , is relatively small , as expected since our broadband sed - derived sfr estimates are not sensitive to star formation on such small time scales .",
    "the deviations on 100 - 50  myr time scales are the largest ( figure  [ dsfrd]b ) , and this is also a time region with good sensitivity in our sed fits .",
    "when comparing the 1000 - 500  myr sfr estimates ( figure  [ dsfrd]d ) , the differences are relatively small .",

    "while there is overlap between bcds and late - type lvl galaxies , the bcd population is offset higher than normal galaxies , suggesting that the star forming events ( in terms of the mass involved ) may be more substantial in bcds .",

    "would unambiguously be considered starbursting systems ( and possibly bcds ) .",
    "figure  [ bfrac ] can also be used to crudely estimate a duty cycle on the bursting phase of bcds ( more specifically , in terms of the amount of young stellar mass involved in the burst ) , based solely on assumptions about the population demographics of starbursts in this sample .",
    "we must also assume that @xmath91 represents a single burst , and not multiple star formation events which are blended together into a single representative population in the sed fit . with these simplifying assumptions",
    ", we can pick a typical value of @xmath91 and ask how many galaxies currently have a current young population mass fraction that large . for example , picking a set of objects with @xmath138 includes 14 galaxies ( from both the lvl and bcd samples ) , only one of which has a present - day young stellar population with @xmath139 the total mass .",
    "the largest young population mass fraction of this set of objects is only @xmath140 , and the average young mass fraction is @xmath141 .",
    "clearly most of these objects show evidence of significant starbursts in their past , but only @xmath142 in @xmath143 is experiencing a similarly strong burst at the present day .",
    "figure  [ bfrac ] also shows the sed - determined ages of the burst population by the colored rings around points , which can help further constrain the duty cycle of these starbursts .",
    "the points nearest to the 1:1 line are more often young bursts ( with age@xmath144  myr ) , while the points in the middle are typically middle - aged bursts , and the points with low present - day young population mass fractions are typically old bursts ( with age@xmath145  myr ) . in the set of objects with @xmath138 ,",
    "there is a correlation between burst ages and young stellar mass fractions , in the sense that older bursts have significantly smaller young stellar mass fractions .",
    "it appears that most of the galaxies with the highest @xmath91 had their bursts @xmath146  gyr ago , and have a very weak young stellar population today .",
    "these types of systems with historically strong but currently faded bursts may be interesting objects to followup with searches for post - burst bcds .",
    "the young population burst ages of the bcds ( shown in table  [ best1 ] ) are somewhat larger than might be expected .",
    "some of the most extreme bcds have young population ages @xmath147  myr ( e.g. , i  zw  18 and mk  36 ) , but many have young population ages between 500 and 1000  myr , and some even @xmath148  myr .",
    "however , based on the strong h@xmath26 emission from the bcds , it is unlikely that their young populations can be this old . instead , this over - estimate of burst age demonstrates a limitation of our sed fits .",
    "the broadband fluxes used in the sed fit are most sensitive to star formation on 100 - 1000  myr timescales , but only crudely and with low resolution .",
    "even if the bcds have had recent ( 50 - 100  myr ) star formation events , the sed fits are unable to resolve sfh changes on such short timescales . in this way ,",
    "the sed fits are almost certainly systematically under - estimating the current star formation rates of galaxies which have recently started forming stars , which is consistent with the behavior seen in figure  [ msfr ] .",
    "to look for correlations between these burst strength indicators and the current amount of star formation in these galaxies , figure  [ fracsfr ] shows the values of @xmath91 and the young stellar population mass ratio as functions of sfr estimates averaged over 50 and 500  myr . as was the case with figures  [ bfracm ] and [ bfrac ] ,",
    "the bcds are more distinctive in terms of their young stellar population mass ratio than their initial burst strengths .",
    "in contrast with the comparison between burst strengths and stellar mass , however , none of these indicators appear to be correlated with sfr . *",
    "[ jessica says think about ssfr as well , in looking for correlations here .",
    "] * this suggests that the absolute amount of sfr in a bcd or lvl galaxy is not a defining characteristic on its own , but that intense ( in terms of mass fraction ) starbursts can happen in galaxies with high or low star formation rates .",
    "an absolute sfr cutoff will not be useful in identifying bcd - like galaxies which may experience a different mode of star formation than typical star - forming galaxies on the `` main sequence '' .    as an alternative parametrization of the significance of the current star formation episode",
    ", we also calculate the birthrate parameter of @xcite , defined as : @xmath149 where @xmath0 is the birthrate parameter , sfr is an estimate of the current sfr , and @xmath3sfr@xmath4 is the total lifetime average sfr .",
    "this parameter is related to the specific star formation rate and also to the young stellar population mass fraction and @xmath91 , but now parametrizes the starburst in terms of its star formation rate instead of the mass of the young stellar population .",
    "we make two versions of @xmath0 , one calculated using the most recent 50-myr averaged sfr ( @xmath150 ) as the numerator and one with the sfr determined from h@xmath26 observations ( @xmath151 ) as the numerator . in both cases , the denominator is the lifetime average sfr from the sed fits ( closely related to the total stellar mass ) .",
    "these birthrate parameters are plotted as a function of stellar mass in figure  [ bsfr ] . as discussed previously , the h@xmath26 sfr is more sensitive to recent intense star formation , while the sed sfr probes longer time scales .",
    "note that these birthrate parameters are not measuring the stellar mass involved in the star formation event , but represent the significance of the current star formation in comparison with a galaxy s total lifetime of star formation . for a particular galaxy ,",
    "the birthrate parameter describes the significance of its current star formation in its long - term evolution . a galaxy with a birthrate parameter of @xmath152 is typically required to be considered a starburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the smallest dwarf galaxies , the effects of star formation can be more significant ( i.e. , the effects of feedback on galaxy - wide scales ) than the same absolute amount of star formation in larger galaxies .",
    "the birthrate parameter gives a good indication of the significance of the current sfr .",
    "starbursting galaxies with @xmath153 typically are undergoing a truly transformative event , distinct from the low - level fluctuations in sfr which are typical in dwarf galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ bsfr ] , the @xmath0 values for the bcds show the correlation with stellar mass in the sense that lower stellar masses have larger @xmath0 values , in the same way as @xmath91 and the young population mass fraction increased at lower stellar masses .",
    "this behavior is expected if the starbursts are similar in size , but can have a greater impact on a lower mass galaxy than on a higher mass galaxy .",
    "when comparing the @xmath0 values for the bcd and lvl samples , the bcds have values which are at or beyond the maximum values from the lvl non - bcd samples .",
    "in particular , one lvl galaxy also populates this extreme area : ugca  281 , which has long been classified as a bcd @xcite . on the other hand , some members of our bcd sample ( notably the three most massive galaxies : mk  324 , mk  328 , and mk  900 )",
    "populate the more normal areas of parameter space .",
    "the early - type galaxies from the lvl sample ( red triangles ) and the bcd / es ( cyan triangles ) have some of the lowest values .",
    "these are also at somewhat higher masses , so a star formation event may have a smaller impact on their evolution .    whether measured by the 50-myr average from sed fits or by h@xmath26 fluxes , the birthrate parameters for bcds are extreme , and",
    "show that the current star formation in bcds is proceeding at a level which is not typical for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "while our sed fits can only generate coarse estimates of key physical parameters ( e.g. , m@xmath154 , sfr ) for the complete lvl sample and our bcds , they still provide a systematic and meaningful way to compare the bcds with normal lvl galaxies .",
    "our sed fits have shown that bcds are forming stars at exceptionally intense rates and may populate an elevated relation parallel to the `` star formation main sequence . ''",
    "however , the sed fits can not provide the detailed star formation histories which would be needed to clearly identify both past and present intense ( but unsustained ) levels of star formation in order to separate bcds ( both past and present ) from normal dis .",
    "much of the detailed information about a galaxy s sfh is not accessible through sed fits alone , but can only be probed via studies of resolved stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , our sed fits can still be used to discuss and constrain the possible evolutionary connections between dwarf galaxies .",
    "most of the empirical sfr and stellar mass indicators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been calibrated using galaxies with large stellar masses ( m@xmath154@xmath155m@xmath156 ) , with modest abundances ( @xmath39@xmath155@xmath157 ) , and star formation rates ( sfr@xmath155@xmath142@xmath82yr ) .",
    "more recently , some groups have been able to test whether these standard relations apply equally well to galaxies with lower masses , lower abundances , and possibly higher sfrs .",
    "@xcite found that for galaxies with low sfr , h@xmath26 measurements give systematically lower sfrs than are measured in the uv .",
    "similar findings have been reported by other groups as well @xcite .",
    "we can also compare the sfrs for the galaxies in our sample , as shown in figure  [ hauv ] , and plot sfr from h@xmath26 against sfr from uv . the best fit relation from @xcite",

    "lvl galaxies are shown in black , and bcds in blue . in black",

    "the offset between bcds and lvl galaxies is likely due to assumptions in the empirical conversion factors about sfh , which the bcds do not obey .",
    "the red line shows the best fit relation from @xcite .",
    "[ hauv ] ]    the bcds appear offset from the main population in figure  [ hauv ] , which is similar to the offsets previously seen in the sfr comparisons ( e.g. , figure  [ sfr ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ external ] , the bcds have systematically larger sfr@xmath118 than @xmath3sfr@xmath4@xmath83 , while their sfr@xmath158 and @xmath3sfr@xmath4@xmath84 estimates are in better agreement .",
    "a similar offset in the bcd sfr@xmath118 estimates is seen here in figure  [ hauv ] .",
    "a possible explanation for this offset lies in the calibration of these sfr indicators .",
    "the empirical sfr estimates used to generate sfr@xmath158 and sfr@xmath118 both assume a constant sfr . in the fuv , the flux comes from young stars with lifetimes @xmath5@xmath159  years , and correspondingly measures the sfr on those time scales .",
    "the h@xmath26 flux comes from gas ionized by massive o - stars and early - type b - stars , with shorter lifetimes than those providing uv flux . as such , the h@xmath26-derived sfr probes shorter time scales .",
    "@xcite argue that the change of this relationship at low sfrs may be due to stochastic variations in the sfh of low mass galaxies , where the uv sfr averages over longer time scales and will typically be larger than the h@xmath26 sfr in the case of a bursty sfh .",
    "as shown in figure  [ hauv ] , the bcds ( from our sample and from within lvl ) nearly always have larger h@xmath26 sfrs than uv sfrs .",
    "this suggests that the bcds may be in a phase of their sfh where intense star formation has only recently begun , and is better traced by the h@xmath26 sfr than by uv .",
    "the best - fit sfrs from the sed fits are driven by the uv emission , and as such are not sensitive to the recent star formation which produces h@xmath26 emission .",
    "if the bcds have had a recent enhancement in sf activity , the uv sfr measurement could be diluted by the lower sf which may have preceded the current event .",
    "the comparisons from section  [ external ] between empirical estimates of stellar mass ( via @xmath105 m and k@xmath110 luminosity ) and sfr ( via h@xmath26 and uv luminosity ) with those from the sed fits were primarily intended as consistency checks of the sed fitting process .",
    "however , they can also be used to test the reliability of different stellar mass and sfr estimators for particular objects . for most galaxies in our sample ,",
    "the sed fitting gives sfr and stellar mass values consistent with the empirical methods .",
    "however , the galaxies with inconsistent values require further investigation . there can be many reasons for individual galaxies to deviate from the normal relationships : they may be intrinsically unusual objects in a brief evolutionary stage or an uncommon region of parameter space , or may be examples of objects which have seds that are not well fit by our methods .",
    "here we look at individual objects from the previous figures as examples of the types of outliers in this work .",
    "as shown in section  [ external ] , the sed - derived stellar masses are generally in good agreement with the empirical estimates from @xmath105 m and k@xmath110 luminosity measurements .",
    "we have identified only very slight offsets or non - unity slopes in these relationships . on the @xmath105 m plot in the left panel of figure  [ m ] , there are no significant outliers from the distribution of points . on the right panel of figure  [ m ] which shows the stellar mass from k@xmath110 photometry , the object furthest above",
    "the relation is a bcd ( um  462 ) and the object furthest below the relation is an lvl galaxy ( ugc  01056 ) .",

    "these deviations are still within the bayesian estimates of uncertainty on the sed fits , and represent the most deviant mass estimates .    in our comparison of sfr estimates shown in figure  [ sfr ] , some galaxies are significantly deviant from the overall relationship . in the comparison between @xmath3sfr@xmath4@xmath84 and sfr@xmath158 ( right panel ) , one galaxy ( sextans",
    "a ) is a significant outlier * [ quantify/??]*. we now consider what made that outlier drift so far from the relationship .",
    "sextans  a has similar values of sfr@xmath118 and @xmath3sfr@xmath4@xmath83 ( within 0.4  dex ) , and it is unclear what has caused its uv and sed sfr estimates to deviate .",
    "its other best - fit parameters are fairly typical , and its sed fit has a reduced @xmath160 .",
    "however , given its diffuse nature and large extent , it is possible that some of the photometry has not been measured carefully enough . *",
    "[ look at dohm - palmer2002 , dolphin2003 papers ? ] * the scatter in the comparison between sed sfrs and h@xmath26 sfrs is somewhat larger , but may be intrinsic to any h@xmath26 sfr estimate , as discussed earlier and in @xcite .    *",
    "[ jessica says move this to sfr discussion area .",
    "also clarify what `` not measured carefully enough '' means . quantify ! ] *    throughout this analysis it has become clear that some members of our bcd sample are less extreme than others . in particular , mk  324 , mk  328 , and mk  900 ( labeled as `` bcd / e '' on the figures ) typically have properties more similar to the average lvl late - type galaxies .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that these three were the reddest ( b@xmath10v@xmath5@xmath161 in their outskirts ) , most luminous , and most metal - rich objects in this bcd sample .",
    "the sed fits have shown that these three also have the largest stellar masses ( m@xmath162@xmath163@xmath164 ) and the lowest specific star formation rates ( ssfr@xmath165 /yr ) of the bcd sample .",
    "given the dissimilarities between the three objects and the rest of the bcd sample , we advise caution when drawing conclusions about bcds based on the inclusion of these three objects .",
    "they have been included in our sample to cover the broad range of objects commonly referred to as bcds , but may be more intermediate between extreme bcds and more typical dwarf irregular galaxies .      with the exception of mergers ,",
    "galaxies rarely evolve faster than when they are experiencing intense star formation events such as those happening in the bcds . in order to understand where bcds ( and bcd - like ) galaxies fit into dwarf galaxy evolution",
    ", we must understand the transformative effects of their active star formation .",
    "the term `` starburst '' is often used to describe a variety of galaxies experiencing star formation events . in different parametrizations ,",
    "the star formation can be measured in terms of how much higher the sfr is compared to average , or in terms of how much stellar mass the current episode will produce compared to the total stellar mass . each method will identify a different type of starbursting galaxy . in reality , there is a broad continuum of galaxies with different intensities of star formation , which will have differing impacts on their ongoing evolution .    in this work , we are particularly interested in the transformative effects that intense star formation events can have on dwarf galaxies .",
    "this can be discussed in terms of the burst fraction ( @xmath91 ) , which is the mass fraction of the star - forming population when it first formed , as shown in figure  [ bfrac ] .",
    "this graph also shows the present - day mass fraction of the star - forming population , which gives an indication of how much of a role the star - forming population still plays in the galaxy . in this parametrization ,",

    "some of the bcds even lie close to the region of parameter space where @xmath91 and the young population mass ratio are equivalent , which would indicate a very young burst .",
    "bcds are not just sites of young bursts  they are also exceptional in their large values of @xmath91 .",
    "it appears from figure  [ bfrac ] that as galaxy evolution proceeds , the points will move to the left ( same value of initial @xmath91 , but ever - decreasing young population mass fraction as younger stars perish ) . in that way",
    ", the stellar populations of the bcds may become less distinctive from the late - type lvl galaxies as their young populations continue to age .",
    "we can also parametrize the impact of the star formation population in terms of its initial mass fraction , at the time it first started forming stars .",
    "this birthrate parameter is discussed at the end of section  [ bstrength ] and is a ratio of the current ( or recent ) sfr to the total average sfr .",
    "figure  [ bsfr ] shows the relationship between @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( using the sfr averaged over the most recent @xmath107 myr and the sfr from h@xmath26 observations ) and the stellar mass . in this parametrization , the bcds are at the extreme edge of a very broad parameter space . for their mass ,",
    "bcds have values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 at or above the highest values of the lvl sample .",
    "some lvl galaxies also populate this extreme area , notably ugca  281 , which has long been classified as a bcd @xcite . on the other hand , some members of our bcd sample ( notably mk  324 , mk  328 , and mk  900 ) populate the more normal areas of parameter space . this parametrization is a useful way to measure the impact of the current star formation in terms of the galaxy s star formation history .    in a recent paper , @xcite",
    "make a case for using the term `` starburst '' with care , and only in situations with extreme burst strengths or birthrate parameters .",
    "this distinction matters especially when considering the global effects of star formation on galaxies , and trying to identify the galaxies which are being transformed the most rapidly by their current star formation episodes . in the smallest dwarf galaxies",

    "today , studies of resolved stellar populations in large numbers of dwarf galaxies are providing increasingly precise estimates of their sfhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sfhs are showing that most dwarf galaxies have had similar average sfh over their lifetimes ( although somewhat less than the cosmic sfr ) , and much of their differentiation may have occurred in the most recent few gyrs , typically as a result of environmental effects @xcite * [ check - is this for all masses ? there is a mass dependence on environmental effects ? ?",
    "otherwise these are sort of contradictory and flip - floppy]*. however , some populations of star - forming dwarf galaxies do not show a correlation between environment and recent star formation events , suggesting that internal processes may be regulating star formation in some of the smallest galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for large galaxies , the stellar mass ( and ,",
    "correspondingly , the local environment ) may be the primary regulator of star formation ( and merger ) events .",
    "however , smaller star - forming dwarf galaxies are typically more isolated and their star formation may be more strongly regulated by internal processes .",
    "in section  [ pastsf ] we explored whether the results from the sed fits can crudely constrain the sfh of the bcds and lvl galaxies .",
    "while much more coarse than the full resolved stellar population fitting , the sed fit results can still produce broad constraints on sfh .",
    "we use the sfr averages over different time scales as approximations to the complete sfh , and discuss some of the individually deviant galaxies in section  [ individuals ] .",
    "while the bcds do not clearly distinguish themselves from the lvl population in these diagnostic plots ( e.g. , figures  [ dsfr ] and [ dsfrd ] ) , they are among the extreme objects in those parametrizations .",
    "the sed fits are helping to identify galaxies with apparently unusual deviations in their sfh on particular time scales , which may require individual followup study in order to understand their roles in dwarf galaxy evolution .      with",
    "their short gas depletion time scales and rapid star formation rates , bcds are in an unsustainable evolutionary state , and can not continue forming stars at their current rate .",
    "many groups have studied or discussed the implications of a population of faded or post - burst bcds @xcite .",
    "here it is important to separate possible evolutionary pathways based on whether external or internal effects are being considered .",
    "@xcite consider the long - term evolution of bcds in the virgo cluster , and find that bcds may fade into galaxies similar to the extant population of early type dwarfs in the virgo cluster .",
    "they further suggest that in the cluster environment , a compact early type dwarf may have its star formation re - ignited if it acquires fresh gas . in lower density environments , @xcite searched for bcds in quiescence ( qbcds ) by selecting galaxies with compact structural parameters and other bcd - like properties , but without the current intense star formation event . within their search criteria , they found a very large population of qbcds , and suggest that perhaps 1/3 of all local dwarf galaxies may be capable of hosting a bcd - like burst . whether such intense starbursts are this common is still an open question .",
    "in this work , some of the sed - derived parameters for the bcds and lvl galaxies will evolve with time , while others will not .",
    "for example , the initial burst fraction ( @xmath168 ) of the current star star forming population will not decrease with time , while the young population mass fraction will continue to decline .",
    "similarly , the total stellar mass will not change quickly , while the color will shift from blue to red as the hottest youngest stars perish .",
    "we can generate model predictions for the future evolution of bcds , but this requires that we assume there are no external effects driving this evolution .    in the simple case of internal evolution only , the stellar populations of the bcds would age normally , and follow the characteristic isochrones for older ages .",
    "the resulting objects may resemble the so - called `` postburst '' galaxies ( or e+a , k+a , a+k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these galaxies are characterized by strong balmer line absorption ( from the most massive stars still alive , the a stars ) , but no h@xmath26 emission ( as the o and b stars have perished ) .",
    "other groups have used the @xmath169 break @xcite or star formation histories from resolved stellar populations @xcite to identify galaxies which have experienced strong star formation events . further followup on individual post - bcd - like galaxies",
    "is necessary to explore this connection further .",
    "in this work we have used panchromatic observations ( from uv to fir ) of a large sample of 258 lvl galaxies and 18 bcds to generate and fit seds in order to determine key physical parameters about these galaxies .",
    "these fits have allowed us to explore the role that bcds play in the larger context of dwarf galaxy evolution .",

    "two - burst stellar population models fit the observed seds significantly better than one - burst models , suggesting that most or all dwarf galaxies have an old stellar population . *",
    "while powerful , the inability of sed fits to return a detailed sfh makes it difficult to answer questions about the evolutionary histories of individual bcds .",
    "* when using h@xmath26 sfrs in place of sed sfrs , the bcds appear even more extreme than typical galaxies , suggesting that the sf activity in bcds is uniquely intense or recent , and that sed fits are not sensitive to the recent star formation traced by h@xmath26 emission .",

    "we briefly consider systematic effects and biases across the m@xmath154 and sfr indicators used in this work . as a diagnostic ,",
    "we start from the assumption that galaxies on the star - forming main sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) populate a narrow range of star formation rates at a given stellar mass . to assess the quality of of our various m@xmath154 and sfr indicators , we can compare the dispersion about that relation using each combination of the values of m@xmath154 and sfr produced in this work . in this work ,",
    "our m@xmath154 estimates include those using simple mass - to - light ratios from monochromatic photometry ( in both @xmath105 m and k@xmath106 ) , and from our sed fitting analysis ( e.g. , figure  [ m ] ) .",
    "our sfr estimates include those from narrow - band h@xmath26 photometry and from our sed fitting ( e.g. , figure  [ sfr ] ) . in order to consistently quantify the scatter in the m@xmath154-sfr relation across different estimators , we first select lvl galaxies which are not identified as early - types or bcds . in this type of comparison",
    ", galaxies with extreme ( high or low ) star formation properties will add scatter to the main sequence m@xmath154-sfr relation , and should not be included .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that stellar mass determinations based on uv+optical+mir sed fits are systematically affected at different ssfrs by @xmath170  dex ( see their figure  9 ) .",
    "we also require that galaxies in this comparison have a complete set of observations required to generate these estimates ( i.e. , fluxes measured at @xmath105 m , k@xmath106 , h@xmath26 , and a best - fitting sed with reduced @xmath98 ) .",
    "this yields a common sample of 97 lvl galaxies which we use to compare m@xmath154 and sfr estimates .",
    "figure  [ rms ] shows the m@xmath154-sfr relations for each combination of indicators in this common sample .",
    "the top row compares the h@xmath26 sfrs with our three estimates of mass ( sed - fit , k@xmath106 , and @xmath105 m ) , and the bottom row shows the 50-myr - averaged sfr from our sed fitting .",
    "the results of linear least squares fits to the sfr - m@xmath154 relations in each panel are shown , and the rms scatters are given .",
    "within this sample , the scatter about the fit increases from m@xmath154(@xmath105 m ) to m@xmath154(k@xmath106 ) to m@xmath154(sed ) ; and also increases from sfr(h@xmath26 ) to sfr(sed ) .",
    "the relation with the lowest scatter ( 0.39  dex ) is sfr(h@xmath26 ) vs m@xmath154(@xmath105 m ) , and the sed - fit quantities have the largest scatter ( 0.50  dex ) given that the scatter in the sfr - m@xmath154 relation increases when using sed fits , one might question whether the sed - fitting is improving the determination of sfr and m@xmath154 in this analysis .",
    "however , the goal of this project is not to simply re - measure sfr and m@xmath154 in normal main sequence star - forming galaxies using standard monochromatic indicators ( for works which focus on statistical samples of star - forming galaxies , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "rather , we are adopting a consistent sed - fitting methodology in order to determine sfr and m@xmath154 even when considering more extreme galaxies which have not previously been included in calibrating m@xmath154 and sfr indicators .",
    "this approach allows us to quantify the differences between bcds ( with extreme star formation ) and the population of main sequence star - forming galaxies , using consistent estimates of sfr and m@xmath154 .",
    "strong and/or recent star formation can bias monochromatic stellar mass estimates of galaxies .",
    "for example , if a dwarf galaxy undergoes a strong starburst , some of its k@xmath106 and @xmath105 m luminosity will come from the young stellar populations and those monochromatic estimates of stellar mass could be systematically larger than for an otherwise similar passive ( or normal star - forming ) galaxy . also note the relative positions of the four lvl galaxies classified as bcds ( black stars ) on the top row of the figure  [ rms ] . in each panel",
    "those four galaxies have the same sfr(h@xmath26 ) , but their m@xmath154 values are different . when using @xmath105 m or k@xmath106 luminosity to estimate m@xmath154 , these four galaxies are closer to the best - fit main sequence line for normal galaxies .",
    "however , if the full sed - fitting is used , their m@xmath154 estimates are reduced  it appears that their strong star formation events may be artificially enhancing their @xmath105 m and k@xmath106 stellar masses . by including uv , optical , and ir photometry",
    ", our sed - fits produce more robust m@xmath154 and sfr estimates for our diverse sample of galaxies which have a wide range of star formation histories .",
    "this systematic and consistent approach allows us to compare bcds with a large sample of `` normal '' galaxies , without a bias toward main - sequence star - forming systems ."
