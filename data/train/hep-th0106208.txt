    "among the most important characteristics of cosmic strings is the existence of a symmetry axis and the concentration of energy around this axis @xcite .",
    "one can ask if cosmic strings are the only configurations displaying this feature . taking into account gravity ,",
    "the existence of a symmetry axis implies cylindrical symmetry for the metric as well .",
    "all static cylindrically symmetric solutions of einstein equations in vacuum are of the kasner type .",
    "the vanishing of the energy - momentum tensor in the `` asymptotic '' region of any physically reasonable solution implies that the geometry should approach a kasner line there .",
    "as the energy momentum tensor corresponding to these axial configurations implies the invariance of the metric under boosts , one is left with only two kasner geometries : a flat space presenting a conical singularity and a melvin like space @xcite .",
    "the first case leads to the well known cosmic strings whose possible role in cosmology ranges from structure formation to baryogenesis .",
    "the second solution has received less attention because it seems to present a singular behaviour in the metrical sector : circles of increasing `` radius '' display decreasing circumferences .",
    "recent investigations suggest that for an abelian - higgs system with a symmetry breaking scale much smaller than the planck scale , asymptotically melvin - like solution coexist with the habitual string configuration as long as the angular deficit of the latter does not exceed @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the inertial and tolman masses of the two solutions have been contrasted @xcite .",
    "however , the unusual behaviour of the metric has not been addressed .",
    "the key point of this article is the interpretation of this unusual geometry .",
    "we shall argue that the coordinate which has been considered as the radius in the second special kasner - line element ( i.e. the melvin - like geometry ) is a rather complicated function of the `` true '' radius . to support our proposal",
    ", we shall invoke the coordinatization of the sphere by polar stereographic variables in the first section .",
    "this example , although elementary , strongly suggests that letting @xmath4 go to infinity in the second special kasner line element , one enters an asymptotic region _ which shrinks to the symmetry axis_. in the third section , an abelian lagrangian is coupled to the einstein - hilbert one .",
    "looking for an axially symmetric configuration different of the string , the preceding section imposes the vanishing of the vector and the scalar field as the coordinate @xmath4 , formerly interpreted as a radius , goes to infinity .",
    "this is at odds with previous treatments and results in a divergent inert mass per unit length if the v.e.v of the higgs field does not vanish for example .",
    "in the fourth section we find that the trajectories of massive particles are bounded from above in this space time .",
    "we also study massless particle trajectories and discuss the causal structure of the new solution . due to the cylindrical symmetry",
    ", we propose a penrose- like diagram , but with each point representing a two geometry conformal to a cylinder . in the fifth section ,",
    "we study the wave function which describes a condensate or a current of a fermion charged under the abelian field considered .",
    "the metric [ 1 ] ds^2 = c r^4/3 ( dt^2-dz^2)-dr^2 - d r^-2/3d^2 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive constants is what we call the second kasner line element .",
    "it has been shown to satisfy einstein equations in the vacuum @xcite ; it displays a cylindrical symmetry if @xmath7 is identified with @xmath8 .",
    "if one considers the circle parameterized by @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] , its circumference @xmath11 decreases as the `` radius '' @xmath12 increases .",
    "but , the circle given by @xmath13 being space - like everywhere and having a null length can not be anything else than a point .",
    "this is already realized on the sphere .",
    "consider a point @xmath14 located on the sphere of radius @xmath15 centered at @xmath16 . the straight line joining @xmath17 to the north pole intersects the plane @xmath18 at the point @xmath19 specified by [ 2 ] x = a(1-)y = b(1- ) where [ 3 ] = 2(a^2+b^2 ) + ^2 + .",
    "introducing the polar stereographic coordinates ( @xmath20 ) by @xmath21 , @xmath22 one obtains [ 4 ] ds^2 = 16 ^ 4 dr^2 + 16 ^4 r^2 d^2 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 becomes a decreasing function for large values of the coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "if one does not know where this metric comes from and interpret it as a radius , a circle of infinite radius turns out to be of null length .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath24 corresponds to the point at infinity on the plane which is mapped into the north pole by the stereographic projection . here",
    ", @xmath25 is just the north pole .",
    "when the coordinate @xmath26 vanishes , one has another circle displaying a vanishing circumference : the south pole .",
    "the two are on the symmetry axis . introducing the variable [ 5 ] r _ = 2(r/2 )",
    "the metric reads [ 6 ] ds^2 = dr^2 _ + ^2 ^2 ( r _ ) d^2 .",
    "the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath4 is bijective provided that @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the points located on the symmetry axis once again are those for which the coefficient @xmath23 vanish .",
    "the section @xmath29 , @xmath30 of the second kasner line element [ 7 ] ds^2 = dr^2 + b r^-2/3 d^2 is a two dimensional surface ; the preceding discussion strongly suggests that @xmath24 is a  point  on the symmetry axis .",
    "the difference with the sphere lies in the fact that the second special kasner geometry is unbounded since the meridian @xmath31 is of infinite length ; @xmath25 is a point rejected at infinity on the symmetry axis .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by an embedding diagram .",
    "the previous two geometry can be rewritten as [ 8 ] ds^2 = 9 b^-3 ^-8 d^2 + ^2 d^2 . by the trivial change of coordinates @xmath32 .",
    "this line element can be realized in the euclidean space as the surface of revolution [ 9 ] z ( ) = ^_0 d(^8_cr ^-8 -1)^1/2 . which is real only for the values of @xmath33 satisfying the inequality [ 10 ] _ cr = ( 9 b^-3)^1/8 .",
    "this can be translated for the geometry given in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) by @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath4 measures the length along a generating line while @xmath35 is linked to the circumference by the usual formula @xmath36 .",
    "the two geometry looks like a bottle with an infinite neck which becomes thinner and thinner ( as @xmath37 ) and a basis which becomes larger and larger(as @xmath38 ) .",
    "the region @xmath39 ( where the components of the riemann tensor associated to geodesic deviations become infinite ) is excluded from the embedding and will be excluded when raccording the second kasner line element to non vacuum solutions of einstein equations .",
    "our embedding is similar to the one developed in the case of the melvin solution @xcite .",
    "the new feature here is that this fact will be used with the example of the sphere to argue that new boundary conditions arise .",
    "what is the causal structure of this second kasner special geometry ? as the relevant symmetry here is axial , we will factorize the geometry of a cylinder . introducing a radial coordinate @xmath40 ( different from the one appearing in eq .",

    "the causal structure is found by making the coordinates @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which parameterizes a sphere , constants .",
    "the remaining geometry is written in terms of bounded ingoing and outgoing null coordinates @xcite .",
    "in the penrose diagram , each point represents a sphere . following this procedure",

    "it should be remembered that each point on such a diagram is a surface conformal to a cylinder .",
    "the difference with the spherical solutions lies in the fact that here we probe the space - time structure using horizontal light rays which cross the symmetry axis at right angles while in the former one uses radial ones .",
    "the intermediary variable @xmath35 was only illustrative since eq.@xmath49 and eq.@xmath50 give the link between the null coordinates and the set of variables @xmath51 .",

    ", we obtained a vanishing scalar field for any value of the parameters . imposing the boundary conditions specified by eq.@xmath68 and eq.@xmath69 , one obtains a function @xmath70 whose values are many orders of magnitude smaller than the error fixed for numerical computations .",
