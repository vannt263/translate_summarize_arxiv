    "in order to deal with divergent expressions in the quantum field theory , it is necessary to regularize a theory .",
    "a proper choice of a regularization can simplify the calculations or reveal some features of quantum corrections .",
    "most calculations in the quantum field theory were made with the dimensional regularization @xcite in @xmath1-scheme @xcite .",
    "however , the dimensional regularization breaks the supersymmetry and is not convenient for calculations in supersymmetric theories . that is why most calculations in supersymmetric theories were made with the dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-function in supersymmetric theories was calculated up to the four - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "after a special redefinition of the coupling constant @xcite the result coincides with the exact nsvz @xmath0-function , proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    however , it is well known that the dimensional reduction is not self - consistent @xcite . removing the inconsistencies one breaks the explicit supersymmetry @xcite",
    ". then the supersymmetry can be broken by quantum corrections in higher loops @xcite . in the @xmath2 sym theory",
    "this already occurs in the three - loop approximation @xcite , while in the @xmath3 sym theory the supersymmetry is not broken even in the four - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "thus , a problem of regularization in supersymmetric theories is rather nontrivial @xcite .    for supersymmetric theories one can use the higher covariant derivative regularization , proposed by a.a.slavnov @xcite .",
    "different versions of this regularization for supersymmetric theories , which do not break the supersymmetry , were proposed in @xcite . unlike the dimensional reduction , the higher covariant derivative regularization is consistent .",
    "however , it was not often applied to explicit calculations of quantum corrections , because the corresponding integrals have very complicated structure , and it is not easy to calculate them analytically , especially in higher loops . moreover",
    ", some theoretical subtleties can raise nontrivial questions even in the simplest calculations @xcite .    however , we argue that for supersymmetric theories this regularization has some very attractive features and can be used for the calculations .",
    "namely , the integrals defining the @xmath0-function are integrals of double total derivatives @xcite , and one of them can be calculated analytically . as a result , the @xmath0-function is related with the anomalous dimension , producing the exact nsvz @xmath0-function without redefinition of the coupling constant . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how this can proved in @xmath4 sqed in all loops and for the general renormalizable @xmath4 sym in the two - loop approximation .",
    "the action of the massless @xmath4 sqed in terms of superfields @xcite is written as    @xmath5    the theory is regularized by adding the term with the higher derivatives    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for example , it is possible to choose @xmath9 .",
    "the gauge is fixed by adding    @xmath10    then the propagator will contain large degrees of the momentum in the denominator , and all loop diagrams beyond the one - loop approximation become convergent .",
    "the remaining one - loop diagrams are regularized by inserting",
    "the pauli  villars determinants @xcite    @xmath11    into the generating functional , where    @xmath12    and @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "it is important that the masses @xmath15 are proportional to the parameter @xmath16 .      in order to find the @xmath0-function we consider    @xmath17    and calculate    @xmath18    in the three - loop approximation the result",

    "thus , with the higher derivative regularization the nsvz scheme can be naturally defined .",
    "however , it is much more complicated problem to calculate analytically the integrals for the anomalous dimension .",
    "possibly , in the lowest orders this can be done analytically , but it seems that in higher loops for this purpose one should use numerical methods .      for the @xmath4 sqed it is possible to demonstrate that the features discussed in the previous section take place in all loops .",
