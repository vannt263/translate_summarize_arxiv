    "although the 4_f _ electron resides within the cerium atom core , its spatially extended 4f - electron wave function can hybridize with valence states of ligands in a compound . depending on the 4_f_ligand hybridization  @xcite strength , the trivalent state , which is standard for a majority of lanthanides ,",
    "can be dynamically mixed with the itinerant 4_f_@xmath7 state to a various extent .",
    "the 4_f_ligand hybridization strength is intimately connected with the overlap of the ce 4_f_electron wave function with the ligand valence electron wave functions and thus with the distance between the ce ion and its ligands  @xcite ( we label it by @xmath8 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 is sufficiently large , the 4_f_ligand hybridization is negligible and the ce@xmath1 valence is preserved .",
    "the ce@xmath1 ion bears a magnetic moment intrinsic to one localized 4_f _ electron . with decreasing @xmath8 ,",
    "the 4_f _ and ligand valence electron wave - functions overlap more and the enhanced hybridization results in a certain probability for the ce ion to lose its only 4_f _ electron and to become tetravalent . the admixture of probabilities of ce@xmath1 and ce@xmath7 states is known as the intermediate valence state ( also fluctuating valence state  frequently labeled as 4_f_@xmath9 ) .",
    "the ce intermediate valence ions typically do not carry any stable magnetic moment and thus do not participate in magnetic ordering  @xcite . + the ce@xmath1 magnetic moments in metals",

    "the ce site with long @xmath10 can be assigned to a ce@xmath1 ion , whereas the other site with short @xmath10 was suggested to be occupied by an intermediate valent or tetravalent cerium  @xcite .",
    "this situation may give rise to a 4_f_charge density wave with the periodicity of the superstructure  @xcite .",
    "when cooling below room temperature , cerusn undergoes two successive polymorphic transitions to other superstructures of the cecoal - type structure characterized by various combinations of ce - ru ( @xmath10 ) distances along the @xmath5axis , while the relative occurrence of the short ce - ru distances increases below each transition  @xcite .",
    "+ the different ce valence states in cerusn are intimately connected to the distances between a particular ce ion and its ru ligands . for smaller @xmath10 distances ,",
    "the overlap of the ce 4_f _ and ru 4_d _ electron wave - functions is larger and consequently the 4_f_ligand hybridization is stronger . for @xmath10",
    "decreasing below a certain critical value , the ce@xmath1 becomes gradually more admixed with the ce@xmath7 state yielding an intermediate valence state . in the strong 4_f_ligand hybridization limit ,",

    "a detailed neutron powder diffraction study  @xcite devoted to the investigation of the low temperature magnetic ordering discussed below also provides evidences that a certain volume fraction of the high - temperature 2_c_-superstructure phase ( htp ) existed in the cerusn polycrystalline powder sample even at low temperatures with the low - temperature 3_c_-superstructure phase ( ltp ) so that the sample appeared `` structurally '' multiphase although remaining `` chemically '' single phase .",
    "this situation may arise e.g. , from the possibility that htp in a certain volume fraction near to surface of powder particles survives during cooling as a metastable phase , whilst the bulk of the sample undergoes successively the transition from htp to the intermediate - temperature 5_c_-superstructure phase ( itp ) .",
    "generally , in polymorphic systems htp may survive as a metastable phase while cooling through the equilibrium htp @xmath12 ltp transition temperature in a part of volume fraction or in the entire sample even in single crystals depending on thermal history  @xcite and only a proper heat treatment enables the formation of the entire stable ltp  @xcite .",

    "+ the magnetization @xmath18 was measured on a single crystal along the three main crystallographic axes of the monoclinic structure .",
    "measurements in fields up to 7  t were realized utilizing a squid magnetometer ( mpms 7  t instrument of quantum design ) in the temperature range between 1.8 and 20  k. the range of applied magnetic fields has been extended to 14  t using a ppms 14  t instrument ( quantum design ) with the vibrating sample magnetometer option .",
    "the electrical resistivity and the specific heat @xmath19 were measured between 0.5 and 20  k using ppms 14  t and ppms 9  t , respectively . for the electrical resistivity measurements ,",
    "the four - probe geometry was used with gold wires ( 25 @xmath20 m in diameter ) spot - welded to the samples . the dramatic structure transitions in cerusn when cooling from room temperature  @xcite",
    "are accompanied with formation of various cracks preventing proper determination of geometrical factor usually derived from bulk dimensions of bar shaped samples .",
    "therefore , we display only the relative resistivity @xmath21 data . for specific - heat measurements , the relaxation method implemented in ppms instruments was employed .",
    "the experiments in magnetic fields have been done with field applied along each direction of the three principal crystallographic axes in order to collect important information on magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility @xmath22 below 10  k is displayed in fig .  1 for all three main crystallographic directions .",
    "no difference has been found between the corresponding zfc and fc dependencies , thus we show only the latter ones . in low magnetic fields ,",
    "we have observed a maximum at @xmath23  k for the field applied along the @xmath4 and @xmath5axis .",
    "this is a somewhat higher temperature than @xmath3 suggested in literature  @xcite obtained from specific heat data ( 2.7  k ) .",
    "the temperature of specific heat maximum is usually considered to coincide with the temperature of magnetic ordering , in our case , the nel temperature of the antiferromagnet cerusn . as shown by fisher  @xcite , the correct value of @xmath3 can be derived from susceptibility data being the temperature at which the product @xmath24 has the maximum . in our case",
    "we have obtained values of 2.8  k and 2.7  k from analyzing the @xmath5- and @xmath4axis data .",
    "+ the @xmath25axis susceptibility is rather weak and shows no maximum but only saturation below 2.9  k. this behavior remains intact in various magnetic field applied along the @xmath25-axis , which is general behavior in the hard magnetization direction of an anisotropic antiferromagnet .",
    "the 2.9  k maximum observed in the @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 plots in low fields applied along the @xmath4 and @xmath5axis , shifts to lower temperatures with increasing magnetic field and , for fields higher than a certain critical value , the maximum vanishes .",
    "such behavior is typical for antiferromagnets with the susceptibility showing a maximum for @xmath28 in the vicinity of the nel temperature ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy within the @xmath2 plane is clearly manifested also by the fact that the temperature of the susceptibility maximum develops differently depending on the direction of the magnetic field . in fields along the @xmath5axis ( lower panel fig .",
    "1 ) the shift of the maximum towards lower temperatures becomes more rapid above @xmath29  t in comparison to the @xmath4axis .",
    "+ as one can see from the magnetization isotherms measured at 1.8  k shown in fig .  2 , cerusn undergoes a metamagnetic transition in the magnetic field applied along the @xmath4 and @xmath5direction with critical fields @xmath30  t and 0.8  t , respectively , showing no hysteresis .",
    "the @xmath31 value represents the magnetic field at which the @xmath32 has a maximum .",
    "the metamagnetic transition is also typical for antiferromagnets and signals the moment where the original antiferromagnetic structure becomes modified or completely destroyed by ( partially ) aligning the magnetic moments along the field direction .",
    "the metamagnetic transition is usually observed in the field direction for which the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility shows a maximum as in our case .",
    "the magnetization of cerusn in the fields above the metamagnetic transition shows a strong tendency to saturation .",
    "it saturates well for field @xmath33  t in the @xmath5axis direction . in the magnetic field",
    "applied along the @xmath25direction , for which the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility shows no maximum , the magnetization shows paramagnetic response remaining very small even at 14  t. the magnetic moment determined at 14  t reaches the values 0.51 , 0.08 and 0.71 @xmath34 for the @xmath4 , @xmath25 and @xmath5axis , respectively , confirming strong anisotropy in the ordered state with the @xmath5axis ( @xmath25axis ) as the easy ( hard ) magnetization direction .",
    "+ the ordered magnetic moment of a free ce@xmath1 ion equals to @xmath35 .",
    "the saturated @xmath5axis value of @xmath36 approximately corresponds to one third of 2.16 , which is consistent with the scenario of the cerusn low - temperature polymorphic phase containing only one ce@xmath1 ion of the totally three ce ions in the unit cell .",
    "the remaining two cerium ions in cerusn are considered carrying no stable magnetic moment since they are either tetravalent or in an ce@xmath1ce@xmath7 intermediate valence state due to strong 4_f_(ce)-4_d_(ru ) hybridization , which is induced by a very short @xmath37   . in contrary",
    ", the ce@xmath1 ion has the ru ligands at a long distance ( @xmath23   ) .",
    "the magnetic moments of the nearest neighbor ce@xmath1 ions along the @xmath5axis are coupled along the @xmath5axis by a rather weak and complex long - range exchange interaction mediated by the conduction electrons ( rkky - type ) , which may be assisted by a multiple ce - ru hybridization in the ce@xmath1ru  ce  ru  ce  ru ",
    "ce@xmath1 chain winding along the @xmath5axis ( see crystal structure figures in ref .",
    "the lowest @xmath31 value found along the @xmath5axis , as well as the higher well saturated magnetization value , may arise from an antiferromagnetic structure built of antiparallel coupled magnetic moments aligned along or close to the @xmath5axis .",
    "the @xmath5axis metamagnetic transition would then consist of a spin flip process in a field sufficient to break the antiferromagnetic coupling and aligning the moments along the field direction .",
    "+ also the metamagnetic transition in the @xmath4axis is closely related to a destruction of the ground - state antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "nevertheless a field of 14  t is insufficient to align the magnetic moments along the field direction .",
    "this reflects the magnetic anisotropy within the @xmath2 plane .",
    "a new non - collinear magnetic structure is formed stabilized by the @xmath4axis magnetic field and yielding a moment of @xmath38 at 14  t. the weak response of the magnetization to the magnetic field applied along the @xmath25axis , contrary to the metamagnetic transition for the @xmath4 and @xmath5axis , may be conceived within a scenario of an antiferromagnetic structure having the ce magnetic moments fixed perpendicular to this axis , i.e. , within the @xmath2 plane .",
    "this easy - plane anisotropy is so strong that the moments can not be deflected from the @xmath2 plane toward the @xmath25axis by a field of 14  t. the features of the magnetic structure of cerusn deduced from our magnetization data are quite in agreement with the recently published results of neutron powder diffraction experiments  @xcite .",
    "+ to reveal all the details of the magnetic structures in cerusn ( ground - state and field - induced phases ) , combined polarized neutron and resonant x - ray single crystal magnetic diffraction in magnetic fields supported by results of relevant xmcd experiments on well - defined single crystals are strongly desired .",
    "+ the specific heat of cerusn shown in fig .  3 exhibits a sharp anomaly having a maximum at 2.8  k , which can be attributed to the transition from a paramagnetic phase to an antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "integration of the @xmath39 vs. @xmath27 dependence over temperature yields the entropy , which in overall reaches a value of @xmath40 at 4  k. at this temperature the entropy is almost entirely of magnetic origin .",
    "this means that the magnetic entropy in cerusn at 4  k is close to @xmath41 , which also corroborates the scenario based on only one third of cerium atoms bearing a magnetic moment equivalent to the moment of a free ce@xmath1 ion .",
    "these ce magnetic moments order antiferromagnetically below @xmath3 .",
    "application of an external magnetic field in the @xmath4 and @xmath5direction firstly shifts the specific heat anomaly to lower temperatures as expected for an antiferromagnet similarly to the evolution of the susceptibility maximum presented before . in fields",
    "higher than the critical field of the metamagnetic transition , the anomaly smears out and moves to higher temperatures , which we understand as arising due to a gradual aligning of the magnetic moments along the field direction . in contrary , the specific - heat anomaly is hardly influenced by a magnetic field of 9  t applied along the @xmath25axis .",
    "this is consistent with the `` paramagnetic '' response in magnetization confirming the @xmath25axis as the hard magnetization axis .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for current applied along the @xmath4axis is depicted in fig .  4 . the antiferromagnetic phase transition of cerusn is accompanied by a sudden drop of resistivity below 3  k as a result of the reduced spin - dependent scattering due to the transition from an incoherent paramagnetic state to a coherent antiferromagnetic structure  @xcite .",
    "a similar temperature dependence of the resistivity in zero magnetic field was observed for the direction of electrical current along the other two principal crystallographic axes ( not shown ) .",
    "the magnetic field applied in the current direction along the @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) or @xmath5axis ( not shown ) leads to a gradual smearing out of the @xmath3 related anomaly .",
    "+ we have also measured the longitudinal magnetoresistance to see especially the response of electrical transport to the field induced metamagnetic transitions . generally , the metamagnetic transitions of antiferromagnets are accompanied by magnetoresistance anomalies  @xcite . in fig .  5 ,",
    "the longitudinal magnetoresistance curves measured for the current along the @xmath4axis at 1.8 and 0.5 k are displayed .",
    "two anomalies occur in the neighborhood of the critical field @xmath42 of the metamagnetic transition observed on the magnetization curve ( see fig .  2 ) . on the 1.8  k curve",
    ", a peak spreading from 0  t to @xmath42 is followed by a large negative response in fields above @xmath42 ( amounting - 25% above 6  t ) .",
    "this latter features correlate with the magnetization above the metamagnetic transition .",
    "the peak in fields just below @xmath42 is usually interpreted in terms of an additional scattering of conduction electrons on spin - flip fluctuations from the coherent ground state antiferromagnetic structure towards the field aligned metamagnetic state .",
    "this can be seen in terms of the simple nel model with two magnetic sublattices , where the dominating effect is the loss of periodicity due to the reversal of moments ( spin flips ) residing in the sublattice with antiparallel orientation  @xcite .",
    "similar positive magnetoresistance for @xmath43 is expected also for band antiferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "+ when @xmath42 is reached , the spin - flip fluctuations cease , the positive magnetoresistance vanishes and the metamagnetic transition ( seen on the magnetization curve in fig .  2 ) has a large negative magnetoresistance response ( fig .",
    "qualitatively similar longitudinal magnetoresistance behavior is observed also for the @xmath5axis current ( not shown ) .",
    "these results are analogous to magnetoresistance behavior of many antiferromagnets in the neighborhood of a metamagnetic transition and are generally understood as follows : the antiferromagnetic spin structure usually has a different periodicity than the underlying crystal lattice .",
    "consequently the exchange interaction between the conduction electrons and magnetic ions introduces new boundaries in the brillouin zone forming a gap over a portion of the fermi surface .",
    "the metamagnetic transition changes the antiferromagnetic structure to a state with magnetic moments aligned along the field direction , which has a magnetic periodicity coinciding with the crystallographic one .",
    "consequently the fermi surface is reconstructed ( the gap is removed ) causing a considerable resistivity decrease  @xcite . + a much smaller and narrower peak on the magnetoresistance curve measured at 0.5  k reflects a reduced influence of thermal fluctuations in generating the spin - flip fluctuations at lower temperatures .",
    "the magnetoresistance drop due to the metamagnetic transition becomes very sharp in @xmath44  k. considering the close correlation between the magnetoresistance and magnetization in fields above @xmath42  @xcite , one may expect also a sharp step of the magnetization at the metamagnetic transition at 0.5  k. at the moment , however , we can not confirm this conclusion having no magnetization measurements at temperatures below 1.8  k available in our laboratory .",
    "we have studied low - temperature magnetization , specific heat and electrical resistivity of cerusn single crystals as functions of temperature and the magnetic field applied along the principal crystallographic directions in order to shed more light on the complicated magnetism of a material containing ce ions in more than one valence state .",
    "our data confirm anisotropic antiferromagnetic ordering ( @xmath0  k ) of ce magnetic moments locked within the @xmath2 plane leaving the @xmath25axis as the hard magnetization direction .",
    "the antiferromagnetic structure is destroyed by a metamagnetic transition in the magnetic field applied along the @xmath4 or @xmath5axis .",
    "+ the saturated easy - axis ( @xmath5axis ) magnetization , as well as the magnetic entropy above @xmath3 , corresponds to a scenario with one third of ce ions in cerusn carrying the magnetic moment equivalent to a free ce@xmath1 ion , whereas the other two thirds of ce ions are in a nonmagnetic mixed valence or tetravalent state .",
    "this is consistent with the expected low temperature cerusn crystal structure ( a superstructure consisting of three unit cells of the cecoal - type piled up along the @xmath5axis also called the @xmath45 superstructure ) , in which the ce@xmath1 ions are characteristic by large distances from the nearest ru ligands , whilst the ce - ru distances of the other two thirds of ce ions are much shorter .",
    "the latter fact leads to a strong 4_f_ligand hybridization and consequently tetravalent and/or mixed valence state of the corresponding ce ions . to our best knowledge , cerusn is a unique case among ce intermetallics , in which a part of ce ions being in ce@xmath1 state coexists in the crystal lattice with mixed valence or tetravalent ce ions with the ce valence being controlled by the ce - ligand hybridization .",
