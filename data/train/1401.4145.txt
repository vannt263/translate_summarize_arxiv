    "a quantum heat engine executing the otto cycle is the prototypic quantum system which has been extensively used in the quest for absolute zero , the attempt to cool a physical system towards lower and lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "the overall performance of the engine is considerably affected by the necessary time to perform the adiabatic expansion and compression phases of the cycle .",
    "although in general an infinite amount of time is needed to complete an adiabatic operation with perfect fidelity , it has been shown that for the heat engine at hand the same fidelity as with the adiabatic process can be obtained in finite time @xcite .",
    "even shorter times can be achieved using the recently proposed ideas of shortcut to adiabaticity @xcite and transitionless quantum driving @xcite , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "note that the perfect , effectively adiabatic evolution is actually an idealization , since in practice there is always present some kind of external noise . in all the above mentioned works , the effect of noise has been considered only indirectly , by requiring to minimize the evolution time , and thus the duration of undesirable exposure to the noise sources .",
    "recently , the effect of noise to the fast adiabatic - like dynamics has attracted some attention and studied for open two - level @xcite and multi - level @xcite quantum systems , cooling @xcite , and for the aforementioned heat engine performing the noisy quantum otto cycle @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we use optimal control to maximize numerically the performance of the noisy quantum heat engine presented in @xcite . note that optimal control has been successfully employed to improve various tasks in the dynamics of open quantum systems . for example , to maximize the efficiency of polarization - coherence transfer between coupled spins in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , to control the relaxation of a qubit @xcite as well as in multi - level quantum systems @xcite , to maximize the fidelity of quantum gates @xcite , and even to manipulate quantum coherence phenomena in light harvesting dynamics @xcite . in parallel with these theoretical works related to the control of noisy quantum systems , there is also considerable experimental progress . as an example we mention the emerging area of quantum optomechanics @xcite , where micro- or nano - mechanical oscillators are coupled to optical cavities @xcite .",
    "full control of the mechanical oscillator quantum state can be achieved using the cavity field , if the coherent coupling rate exceeds the decoherence rate of each subsystem @xcite . for this kind of noisy quantum systems , the optimal efficiency during adiabatic",
    "cooling is an experimental problem of much current interest .",
    "another motivation for the present study is provided by the renewed interest in optimal thermodynamic processes @xcite .",
    "optimal control is the ideal mathematical tool to tackle this kind of problems .",
    "note that the relation between optimal control and thermodynamics is deeper and can be traced back to carathodory .",
    "the famous mathematician , with seminal contributions in the calculus of variations which paved the way to optimal control theory @xcite , pioneered the axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics along a purely geometric approach @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we quickly recall the model of a noisy quantum heat engine proposed in @xcite . in section [ sec : optimal_solution ]",
    "we formulate the problem of maximizing the engine efficiency in terms of optimal control and present an appropriate numerical optimization method .",
    "this method is used in section [ sec : comparison ] to obtain the optimal inputs and the corresponding efficiency of the engine .",
    "the section also contains a discussion of the results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this article we consider the model of a noisy quantum heat engine proposed in @xcite .",
    "the working medium of the engine is an ensemble of noninteracting particles confined by a harmonic potential with a bounded time varying frequency @xmath0 , which serves as the external control of the system . during the execution of a quantum otto cycle ( where changes in the stiffness of the potential correspond to changes in volume @xcite ) ,",
    "the working medium is extracting heat from a cold bath at temperature @xmath1 and delivers it to a hot bath at temperature @xmath2 . the cycle",
    "is composed by four phases : two isochores , where the medium is in contact with the hot or cold bath while @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively , and the expansion / compression phases , where the medium is isolated from these baths and @xmath5 is changed from @xmath6 to @xmath7 or vice versa .    during the operation of the engine , the time evolution of a quantum observable @xmath8 in the heisenberg picture is given by @xmath9+\\mathcal{l}(\\hat{a})+\\frac{\\partial\\hat{a}}{\\partial t},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian for the working medium with particles of mass @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the liouville superoperator expressing the effect of noise , which is different for various phases of the cycle @xcite . at the isochores",
    ", this term results to a trivial exponential decay towards thermal equilibrium @xcite . for this reason we will not pursue further this case but rather concentrate on the more interesting dynamics at the expansion / compression phases .",
    "we emphasize that for these phases the engine is isolated from the heat baths of constant temperature but it is subject to fluctuations in the external control which induce noise @xcite .",
    "the corresponding liouville superoperator is @xcite @xmath13-\\gamma_a\\omega^2[\\hat{b},[\\hat{b},\\hat{a}]],\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants expressing noise strength .",
    "as explained in @xcite and in appendix [ app : stochastic ] , the first term in ( [ superoperator ] ) corresponds to phase damping @xcite , while the second term to random fluctuations in the stiffness of the harmonic potential .",
    "the derivation of the master equation ( [ observable ] ) with decoherence given by ( [ superoperator ] ) relies on the assumption that the two noise mechanisms are independent and represent zero mean gaussian white noises , see for example @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the lagrangian @xmath16 and the position - momentum correlation @xmath17 form a closed set under the time evolution generated by @xmath18 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to follow the expectation values @xmath19 of the above operators , which evolve according to @xmath20l\\nonumber\\\\ -2\\omega c,\\\\ \\label{c}\\dot{c}&=&2\\omega l+\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\omega}}{\\omega}-4\\gamma_p\\omega^2\\right)c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the above equations are equivalent to eq .",
    "( 16 ) in @xcite . in appendix [ app : stochastic ] we show how they can be obtained using stochastic calculus , as an alternative to the open quantum systems formalism used here .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the evolution along the expansion phase of the cycle , where the frequency of the confining harmonic potential decreases from @xmath21 to @xmath22 at the final time @xmath23 , so the working medium is actually expanded .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the initial energy while @xmath26 corresponds to equipartition and @xmath27 to the absence of correlations ( ensemble in thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "our goal is to find the frequency profile @xmath5 which minimizes the final energy @xmath28 , maximizing thus the performance of the engine @xcite .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the system is a monotonically increasing function of the following quantity , called the casimir companion @xcite @xmath29 from ( [ e ] ) , ( [ l ] ) and ( [ c ] ) we find @xmath30.\\ ] ] observe that in the absence of noise @xmath31 , @xmath32 is a constant of the motion ( casimir invariant ) . in this case , the minimum final energy is obtained for @xmath33 and @xmath22 , and is given by @xcite @xmath34 in the presence of noise , it is @xmath35 , so @xmath36 .",
    "we would like to find @xmath5 such that @xmath28 is minimized and the final conditions @xmath37 are satisfied .",
    "we can quantify the performance of the engine relative to the noiseless case using the following measure @xcite @xmath38 note that @xmath39 quantifies the decrease in the heat extraction efficiency of the engine due to noise @xcite . in the ideal , noiseless case it is @xmath40 ;",
    "in general , the smaller is @xmath39 the better is the efficiency of the engine .    in the recent work @xcite",
    "the authors consider the frequency profile @xmath41 @xmath42 . with this choice , the final condition ( [ fi_cond ] ) is satisfied in the ideal case for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 in the presence of noise , the application of the above control input results in some remaining final energy in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 modes .",
    "the dissipation of this parasitic energy into the cold bath can stop the operation of the engine @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will use optimal control to find the frequency profile that minimizes the final energy and thus @xmath39 , while satisfying as closely as possible the final conditions ( [ fi_cond ] ) .",
    "in order to bring the previously defined problem in a more appropriate form for the application of optimization methods , we use the state variables introduced in @xcite , with an additional normalization @xmath47 equations ( [ e ] ) , ( [ l ] ) and ( [ c ] ) become @xmath48 where time and noise strengths are normalized as @xmath49 while the new control variable @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 the initial conditions ( [ in_cond ] ) become @xmath52 the old variables can be expressed as @xmath53 it s not hard to see that the objective to find the control @xmath54 minimizing @xmath55 under the final conditions ( [ fi_cond ] ) is equivalent to minimize @xmath56 under the final conditions @xmath57    the main advantage of using the new variables ( [ new_var ] ) is that @xmath58 does not appear in the new state equations , so the control @xmath54 in ( [ u ] ) can contain even jump discontinuities @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that in the absence of noise the optimal control achieving the minimum value of the final energy ( [ min_energy ] ) in minimum time has the bang - bang form , jumping between and waiting at the extreme values of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "when noise is present ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) , the control appears quadratically in ( [ x2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", optimal control theory @xcite implies that the optimal control may contain , additionally to the bang segments , time intervals where @xmath54 is continuous .",
    "now , an important observation is that no matter what variables we use , we face a two - point boundary value problem , as can be seen from conditions ( [ u_conditions]),([init_cond ] ) , and ( [ final_cond ] ) , in a three - dimensional nonlinear control system . for such problems",
    "it is in general difficult to find an analytical solution , and we have to rely on numerical optimization .",
    "we choose the legendre pseudospectral method for optimal control @xcite .",
    "this method , extensively used for trajectory optimization in aerospace applications @xcite , has been proven successful for pulse design in open quantum systems , in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the method is to convert a continuous - time optimal control problem to a discrete nonlinear programming problem , which can be solved by many well - developed computational algorithms .    in order to apply the proposed method ,",
    "it is first necessary to transform the problem from the time interval @xmath62 $ ] to @xmath63 $ ] , using the transformation @xmath64 . in a redundant use of notation",
    ", we make this transition and reuse the same time variable @xmath65 .",
    "the next step is to approximate the states @xmath66 and the control @xmath54 by the @xmath67th order interpolating polynomials @xmath68 in the lagrange polynomial basis @xmath69 @xmath70 by using the @xmath71 legendre - gauus - lobatto ( lgl ) interpolation nodes , the error in the above approximations is close to minimum @xcite .",
    "the lgl grid is comprised by the endpoints @xmath72 and the @xmath73 roots of the derivative of the @xmath67th order legendre polynomial . from the property @xmath74 of the lagrange polynomials we have @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "the legendre pseudospectral method is a collocation method where the dynamics is enforced at the lgl nodes .",
    "the derivative of @xmath78 at the lgl node @xmath79 is given by @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 are elements of the constant @xmath82 differentiation matrix @xmath83 defined by @xcite @xmath84 equations ( [ x1 ] ) , ( [ x2 ] ) , and ( [ x3 ] ) take the discrete form @xmath85 where @xmath86 and the factor @xmath87 on the left hand sides comes from the initial change in the time variable .",
    "the initial conditions ( [ init_cond ] ) become @xmath88 and , analogously , the final conditions ( [ final_cond ] ) @xmath89 the control constraints ( [ u_conditions ] ) take the form @xmath90 the objective is to find @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath86 , such that @xmath94 is minimized and the above conditions are satisfied .",
    "observe that the original continuous - time optimal control problem has been transformed to a discrete nonlinear programming problem , which can be solved by existent software packages . in this article",
    "we use ampl ( a mathematical programming language ) @xcite with minos 5.5 solver . after calculating the optimal @xmath92 , we interpolate them to obtain a continuous control @xmath54 .",
    "we subsequently apply this control to system equations ( [ x1])-([x3 ] ) using matlab function ode45 , and record the resultant efficiency .",
    "note that all the results of the next section are obtained using @xmath95 .",
    "using the optimization method described in the previous section , we can find the controls maximizing the efficiency of the engine for various values of the parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compdeph1 ] we plot the numerically obtained optimal quantity @xmath39 ( [ delta ] ) versus the normalized duration @xmath96 , in the case of pure dephasing @xmath97 , @xmath98 and for the ratio @xmath99 ( blue solid line ) . for comparison , we also display the same quantity for the frequency profile ( [ mu ] ) used in @xcite and for durations @xmath100 from ( [ tn ] ) ( red circles ) .",
    "obviously , a smaller value of @xmath39 ( and thus a better engine performance ) corresponds to the optimized case .",

    "for the specific parameter values , this minimum time is @xmath101 .",

    "fig : compdeph2 ] we plot for both cases the quantity @xmath103 , which is a measure of the undesirable remaining energy in the @xmath104 modes .",
    "we observe that this parasitic energy is lower in the optimized case ( blue solid line ) .",
    "although one may expect this quantity to be zero for the optimized case , there is a remaining value due to the discretization and the interpolation that we use to obtain the continuous @xmath54 , as explained in the last paragraph of the previous section .",

    "we have shown numerically that there is an improvement in the engine efficiency compared to that obtained with the input used in @xcite , for both amplitude and phase noise . in the case of phase damping we have additionally proved that the ideal performance of a noiseless engine can be retrieved in the adiabatic limit @xmath116",
    ". these results can find application in the quest for absolute zero , i.e. the design of quantum refrigerators that can cool a quantum system to the lowest possible temperature .",
    "they are also directly applicable to the optimal control of a collection of classical harmonic oscillators sharing the same time - dependent frequency @xcite and subjected to similar noise mechanisms .",
    "an interesting extension of the present work is to examine how the results are modified if we allow the control input @xmath114 to take negative values , corresponding to a repulsive parabolic potential for some finite time interval .",
