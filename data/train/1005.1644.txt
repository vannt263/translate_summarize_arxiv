    "event shapes in @xmath0 collisions provide some of the best ways to test qcd and the standard model . at high energies , where qcd is perturbative , event shapes lead to some of the world s most precise measurements of the strong coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "recently , a number of theoretical advances have led to renewed interest in event shapes and the @xmath2 measurements .",
    "first , the nnlo fixed order feynman diagrams were calculated  @xcite .",
    "this allowed the prediction of all event shapes to order @xmath5 .",
    "second , advances  @xcite in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite have allowed resummation of the large logarithmic corrections to thrust to n@xmath1ll accuracy  @xcite .",
    "previous calculations were at nlo  @xcite and nll  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a full effective field theory analysis of a single event shape , thrust , has been completed  @xcite , including additionally non - perturbative considerations .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 extraction is competitive with the pdg world average  @xcite , however it differs significantly from measurements using lattice qcd and @xmath6 decays ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "although the @xmath2 measurement with thrust is extremely precise , there are many reasons to study additional event shapes as well .",
    "the main advantage is that there may be systematic effects in a single event shape pulling @xmath2 in a certain direction , which are not universal .",
    "in fact , as observed in  @xcite from an nll+nnlo analysis , there seem to be two classes of event shapes , the first including thrust , the @xmath7-parameter and total jet broadening , while the second includes heavy jet mass , wide jet broadening and the two - to - three jet transition parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the values of @xmath2 extracted from the two classes at nll+nnlo tend to have around a 5% systematic difference which the authors attribute to missing higher order corrections . in a recent world average of @xmath2  @xcite , the thrust measurement using scet was not included because of a concern over precisely this kind of systematic uncertainty . in this paper",
    ", we correct that concern with a n@xmath1ll calculation of an event shape from the second class , heavy jet mass .",
    "in addition to being useful for measuring @xmath2 , the heavy jet mass distribution allows us to explore other aspects of resummation . indeed , there are few hadronic observables which have been calculated this accurately and for which there is data .",
    "heavy jet mass involves a soft function which can not be written in terms of only a single scale .",
    "these types of soft functions promise to play an important role in resummation at hadron colliders and only beginning to be explored  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss constraints on the soft function , and perform a numerical study of the parts that are not known , similar to what was done in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hadronization is another issue which having a second event shape may help understand . in the fit to @xmath2 with the thrust distribution  @xcite , it was observed that a decrease in @xmath2 could be compensated for with a single non - perturbative parameter with only a small effect on the @xmath9 of the fit .",
    "having another observable for which the same non - perturbative parameters can be fit can possibly remove this flat direction .",
    "the hadronization issue is also important for monte carlo simulations . with a more accurate theoretical calculations",
    ", we can explore whether the approximations in pythia  @xcite allow for an adequate description of thrust and heavy jet mass simultaneously .    as a brief outline of our findings , we begin in section  [ sec : dist ] with an overview of the scet distributions .",
    "the hemisphere soft function is studied and singular terms in the heavy jet mass distribution are compared to the fixed order calculation in section  [ sec : soft ] .",
    "we found a mild inconsistency with the analytic results from scet and the numerical calculations of the nlo and nnlo distributions .",
    "after completing the original study , we were able to resolve this inconsistency , which was due to monte carlo convergence problems , by taking a very low numerical infrared cutoff , as discussed in a note added at the end of this paper . in section  [ sec : fit ] we fit for @xmath2 .",
    "the fit for heavy jet mass to the lep data from aleph  @xcite leads to @xmath10 .",
    "this value is higher than the value from thrust using exactly the same technique , @xmath11 . assuming 100% correlation gives an average value of @xmath4 which is very close to the recent average in  @xcite .",
    "we also find that convergence of the perturbation series for heavy jet mass with resummation is , like for thrust , significantly better than the convergence of the fixed order calculation . in section  [ sec : np ]",
    ", a comparison of the data to pythia shows that while pythia agrees with the thrust data almost perfectly , it has trouble matching the heavy jet mass distribution .",
    "moreover , the hadronization corrections in pythia move the curve in the wrong direction for heavy jet mass . concluding that the monte carlo hadronization model is incompatible with the high precision theoretical calculation",
    ", we explore non - perturbative corrections in scet with a simple shape function .",
    "we find that to the order we are working , this simple shape function can not simultaneously describe the thrust and heavy jet mass distributions .",
    "we provide an expanded summary , discussion and comparison to previous results in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "thrust and heavy jet mass are defined as follows .",
    "one first finds the thrust axis , through @xmath12 where the sum is over all momentum 3-vectors @xmath13 in the event , and the maximum is over all unit 3-vectors @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath15 to measure thrust .",
    "once the thrust axis is known , it can be used to split the event into two hemispheres .",
    "we define @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be the four momenta of the sum of all the radiation going into each hemisphere , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be the hemisphere masses .",
    "heavy jet mass @xmath20 is defined as the larger of the two hemisphere masses squared , normalized to the the center of mass energy @xmath21 , @xmath22 when @xmath20 is small , @xmath6 is also small , both hemisphere masses are small , and the event appears to have two back - to - back pencil - like jets . in this threshold limit , the thrust axis aligns with the jet axis and @xmath23 approaches the sum of the two hemisphere masses squared @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that both thrust , up to power corrections , and heavy jet mass can be written as integrals over the doubly differential hemisphere mass distribution : @xmath25\\label{rhofirst } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in scet , the doubly differential hemisphere mass distribution is calculable in the threshold limit .",
    "the appropriate factorization theorem in scet was first derived in  @xcite for the related process of @xmath26 production .",
    "this theorem was then shown to allow for the calculation of event shapes in  @xcite , where matched and resummed thrust and heavy jet mass distributions in scet were first presented .",
    "previously , resummation of heavy jet mass was only possible at nll accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the first event shape resummed to n@xmath1ll was thrust , in  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo based hadronization corrections were included in  @xcite to produce a strong model - independent gluino mass bound .",
    "recently , power corrections for thrust were studied within the effective field theory approach in  @xcite .",
    "the factorization theorem allows us to write the hemisphere mass distribution as @xmath27 the subscript on @xmath28 is a reminder that this expression holds in the two - jet region . here , @xmath29 is the hard function .",
    "it is calculated in matching scet to qcd and contains information about the modes of qcd that are not in scet .",
    "@xmath30 is a jet function .",
    "it is derived in a matching calculation from a theory with soft and collinear modes to a theory with just soft modes .",
    "the hard function was calculated in  @xcite and the jet functions in  @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath31 is the hemisphere soft function which is derived from integrating out the remaining soft modes .    the doubly differential hemisphere mass distribution , eq .  , is observable , and therefore must be independent of renormalization group scale @xmath32 . demanding @xmath32-independence leads to a renormalization group equation which is easiest to express in laplace space , where the convolutions turn into products .",
    "the laplace transform is defined by @xmath33 which can be applied to the differential cross section and to the jet and soft functions separately .",
    "we generally express the laplace transformed distributions as functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . since the entire @xmath32-dependence of the hard and jet functions",
    "is known , the @xmath32-dependence of the soft function is completely fixed by renormalization group invariance ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the result is that the hemisphere soft function itself factorizes into the form  @xcite @xmath36 where all the @xmath32-dependence is contained in the function @xmath37 which is known to n@xmath1ll accuracy .",
    "since @xmath38 , the function @xmath39 is @xmath32-independent .",
    "we discuss the soft function more in the next section .",
    "putting together the hard and jet functions with the soft function written in this way produces an analytic expression for the doubly differential jet mass distribution .",

    "note that only one value of the unknown function @xmath47 is required for thrust .    for heavy jet mass ,",

    "in contrast to thrust , for heavy jet mass the full functional form of @xmath47 is needed . for n@xmath1ll precision",
    ", we need to know the hemisphere soft function , and hence @xmath47 to two - loop order ( nlo ) . actually , to this order",
    ", we only need one projection of the hemisphere soft function . for three - loop matching ( nnlo )",
    ", we need an additional projection . these projections will be discussed in the next section .",
    "one interesting feature of the hemisphere mass distribution is that the soft interference effects in @xmath47 are only relevant at @xmath50 , which is appropriate for n@xmath1ll resummation .",
    "up to nnll accuracy , the doubly differential distribution is simply the product of the mass distributions in the two hemispheres .",
    "explicitly , @xmath51 where @xmath52   \\left(\\frac{q^2}{\\mu_h^2}\\right)^{-a_\\gamma(\\mu_h,\\mu_j ) }   \\ , \\\\",

    "since , for nnll resummation , the hard and jet functions are only needed to @xmath54 , the square - roots above simply mean take one half of the @xmath2 pieces .",
    "the fact that the distribution splits up in this way was observed at nll level in  @xcite , and is essential to the traditional nll resummation  @xcite .",
    "this simplified factorization suggests that it may be possible to calculate observables involving many more jets with nnll resummation without having to disentangle soft interference effects .",
    "note that this factorization does not guarantee that large logs of @xmath55 can be resummed .",
    "however , it is possible that the calculation of observables with only one scale , such as the sum of many jet masses , or a maximal jet mass , will simplify with scet .",
    "the hemisphere soft function has been studied briefly in  @xcite and more thoroughly in  @xcite .",
    "it is a function of two scales , @xmath56 and @xmath57 as well as the renormalization group scale @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath58 is the direction of the left hemisphere and @xmath59 is the sum of the momenta of all the soft radiation entering this hemisphere , then @xmath56 is the component of @xmath60 backwards to @xmath58 .",
    "that is @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath57 is defined analogously .",
    "the soft function can be factorized into a perturbative , partonic part , and non - perturbative contribution which has support of order @xmath62 .",
    "for now we deal only with the perturbative part , discussing non - perturbative effects in section  [ sec : np ] .",

    "the function @xmath65 is completely fixed by rg invariance in terms of the hard and jet anomalous dimensions .",
    "it can be calculated in perturbation theory by demanding eq .",
    "be independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this gives @xmath66 \\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the @xmath32-independent part @xmath47 must satisfy a number of constraints , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "first of all , since the soft function is symmetric in the two hemispheres , @xmath47 must be an even function of @xmath67 .",
    "second of all , we know the function to order @xmath2 by explicit calculation .",
    "writing @xmath68 the one - loop result is that @xmath69 the authors of  @xcite also observed that @xmath47 is constrained by the non - abelian exponentiation theorem .",
    "non - abelian exponentiation implies constraints on powers of logarithms of @xmath32 in the full soft function .",
    "these constraints are satisfied by the explicit solution , since @xmath70 is an exponential .",
    "the theorem also restricts the @xmath71 color structure in the soft function to be completely determined by the one - loop result , eq .  .",
    "beyond this , however , @xmath47 is unconstrained .",
    "it may even have more general dependence on @xmath67 than logarithms . to determine @xmath47",
    ", we must calculate the soft function perturbatively .",
    "the one - loop calculation has been done but the two - loop calculation , which is required for n@xmath1ll resummation , has not .    a simple alternative to calculating @xmath47 at nnlo is to extract projections of @xmath47 from numerical comparisons to event shape calculations in full qcd .",
    "for example , thrust is only sensitive to @xmath72 . writing @xmath73 and comparing to eq .",
    ", we see that @xmath74 .",
    "the two - loop constant was determined numerically in  @xcite with the use of the event 2 program  @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath75 this is in conflict with the prediction from non - abelian exponentiation , which requires the @xmath76 factor be @xmath77 .",
    "the two - loop constant was also determined in  @xcite , using the same technique but imposing non - abelian exponentiation .",
    "they found @xmath78 the two results agree , except for the @xmath76 term .",
    "indeed , the @xmath76 term seems to indicate a disagreement between the numerical results of the event 2 program and the prediction from non - abelian exponentiation .",
    "since the uncertainty in eq   is too small to explain this disagreement , it is reasonable also to expect the other color structures to be off .",
    "we should therefore allow for a systematic uncertainty on these fits in addition to what is presented , which is essentially a statistical uncertainty associated with the fit .",
    "we discuss this more below .",
    "event shapes other than thrust are sensitive to the form of @xmath47 , not just @xmath72 .",
    "this can be seen , for example , by the form of the heavy jet mass distribution in eq .  .",
    "for n@xmath1ll resummation , the fixed order expansion is required to @xmath50 .",
    "the contribution at this order involving @xmath47 requires at most @xmath79 , with the jet and hard functions at their tree - level values .",
    "thus , the required projection of the @xmath47 for heavy jet mass is @xmath80 the integral representation of @xmath81 is suggestive of a deeper relation between heavy jet mass and the hemisphere mass distribution , however we do not have a physical explanation of why this particular moment appears .",
    "if @xmath47 is a polynomial , this moment is very simple .",
    "for example , if we assume @xmath82 \\,,\\ ] ] then @xmath83 at nlo , the singular part of the heavy jet mass distribution only depends on @xmath47 through @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we can fit @xmath81 numerically the same way @xmath84 is fit with thrust .",
    ", where @xmath85 is the full nlo @xmath86-function , calculated with event 2 and @xmath87 is the singular part , calculated with scet .",
    "the differences are separated by color structure , with the sum also shown .",
    "the kink at @xmath88 is the maximum heavy jet mass for a 3-particle final state .",

    "our simple shape function study shows that the leading power tends to shift @xmath2 from both heavy jet mass and from thrust to lower values , with the heavy jet mass shift of larger magnitude .",
    "this can help explain why the thrust @xmath2 comes out lower than the heavy jet mass @xmath2 in our study , and not in  @xcite .",
    "however , we also found that the best fit over all the aleph data from 91.2 to 206 gev for thrust was incompatible with the best fit from heavy jet mass , and that the flat direction between @xmath2 and the non - perturbative parameter @xmath160 persists in both distributions .    to get the values of @xmath2 extracted from thrust and heavy jet mass to agree",
    "may require including additional ingredients , which can be done within the effective field theory framework .",
    "for example , there is a calculable @xmath161 correction which tends to bring @xmath2 up at least for thrust  @xcite . including every possible correction must produce the same value of @xmath2 from thrust and heavy jet mass , and",
    "it will be interesting to see precisely how this happens .",
    "also , more data should be included .",
    "using data for values of heavy jet mass and thrust closer to the peak will lead to a more constrained shape function fit , although it may require going beyond the leading power .",
    "in addition , using data from other lep experiments and other experiments at lower center - of - mass energy can further test and constrain the event shapes .",
    "however , it is not clear if all of the differences between thrust and heavy jet mass can be accounted for entirely within scet .",
    "for example , there is the possibility that the difference between thrust and heavy jet mass has more to do with the way hadron masses are handled experimentally than from higher order power corrections . in  @xcite , substantial differences in the form of power corrections among the @xmath162-scheme , @xmath163-scheme and decay - scheme were found .",
    "it may turn out that an ultra - precise @xmath2 fit can only be made if the identity of all the hadrons is known , which may be possible for future measurements but is not available for existing data .",
    "more likely , the thrust and heavy jet mass distributions can be made to agree within scet , but the uncertainty on @xmath2 will ultimately be limited by a hadron - mass - scheme dependent uncertainty . in any case , once the ingredients discussed for thrust in  @xcite are applied to heavy jet mass , we will be able to extract a more precise lesson about the importance of power corrections .",
    "in addition to reducing the uncertainty from @xmath2 and teaching us about power corrections , combining the insights from thrust and heavy jet mass will more generally pave the way for deeper understanding of relevant jet - based observables at the lhc .",

    "the default cutoff is @xmath167 , and the authors of event 2 caution about numerical instabilities if the cutoff is taken too low .",
    "we find that for cutoffs below @xmath168 , there are insurmountable numerical problems , however @xmath164 seems to be convergent .",
    "we therefore ran 135 billion events with @xmath164 and 2500 bins ( @xmath169 )  the main text uses 10 billion events with @xmath170 and 1000 bins ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the difference between this new numerical data and the scet prediction for the singular terms is shown in figure  [ fig : nlodiffcut12 ] , which is to be compared to figure  [ fig : nlodiff ] .",

    "fitting a fourth order polynomial to the 38 points between @xmath176 and @xmath177 gives @xmath178 .",

    "performing the same analysis for thrust , leads to @xmath181 combining these , assuming the hoang - kluth ansatz for the soft function , eq .  , gives @xmath182 thus",
    ", we take @xmath183    with these more accurate numbers and a more accurate numerical calculation of the nnlo distribution , we can now repeat our comparison of the singular terms to the exact distribution . using an infrared cutoff of @xmath184 for the @xmath7 functions , the agreement with the singular terms",

    "<S> the heavy jet mass distribution in @xmath0 collisions is computed to next - to - next - to - next - to leading logarithmic ( n@xmath1ll ) and next - to - next - to leading fixed order accuracy ( nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> the singular terms predicted from the resummed distribution are confirmed by the fixed order distributions allowing a precise extraction of the unknown soft function coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> a number of quantitative and qualitative comparisons of heavy jet mass and the related thrust distribution are made . from fitting to aleph data , </S>",
    "<S> a value of @xmath2 is extracted , @xmath3 , which is larger than , but not in conflict with , the corresponding value for thrust . a weighted average of the two produces @xmath4 , consistent with the world average . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the non - perturbative corrections shows that the flat direction observed for thrust between @xmath2 and a simple non - perturbative shape parameter is not lifted in combining with heavy jet mass . </S>",
    "<S> the monte carlo treatment of hadronization gives qualitatively different results for thrust and heavy jet mass , and we conclude that it can not be trusted to add power corrections to the event shape distributions at this accuracy . whether a more sophisticated effective field theory approach to power corrections can reconcile the thrust and heavy jet mass distributions remains an open question .    </S>",
