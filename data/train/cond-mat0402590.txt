    "single electron transport through low - dimensional mesoscopic structures , driven by surface acoustic waves ( saws ) , is a subject of active experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite research , with potential applications in metrology @xcite and new computation technologies @xcite . in a typical experimental setup",
    ", a quasi - one dimensional ballistic channel is defined in a algaas / gaas heterostructure and a saw is launched in the longitudinal direction at a frequency @xmath0 of several ghz . under appropriate conditions ,",
    "the acoustoelectric dc current @xmath1 exhibits a staircase plateau - like structure as function of the gate voltage ( which controls the depletion of the channel ) and of the saw power . at the plateaus ,",
    "the current saturates at quantized values @xmath2 , corresponding to the transfer of an integer number @xmath3 of electrons per each period of the saw ( here @xmath4 is the electron charge ) .",
    "the first plateau is the most flat and robust to changes in the control parameters ; the higher plateaus become less and less pronounced as the plateau number @xmath3 is increased .",
    "in addition , the effect of factors such as source - drain bias @xcite , temperature @xcite , gate geometry @xcite , a secondary saw beam @xcite , and perpendicular magnetic field @xcite on the staircase structure and the quality of the first plateau have been studied experimentally .    in the experiment ,",
    "the plateaus are observed below the conductance pinch - off , when electrons in the source and in the drain reservoirs are separated by a potential barrier .",
    "this observation forms the basis for the simple qualitative explanation of the quantized transport which has been proposed in the first experimental report @xcite and further refined in refs .  , and  .",
    "they argue that when the wavelength @xmath5 of the saw is comparable with the size of the depleted region @xmath6 ( as it is in the experiments @xcite ) , a single potential well forms on top of the static barrier .",
    "this potential well then acts as a dynamic quantum dot , which can hold an integer number of electrons due to the coulomb blockade effect .",
    "the captured electrons are transferred from one side of the barrier to the other , with possible quantization errors due to back - tunnelling @xcite . in the above description ,",
    "the formation of the quantum dot and the transport of the localized electrons are treated separately .",
    "particular effects which have been studied theoretically within this picture are the non - adiabatic effects at the quantum dot s formation stage @xcite , and the classical dynamics of the already confined interacting electrons @xcite .    a different perspective on the problem has been suggested in refs .   and  .",
    "this approach relates the acoustoelectric transport to adiabatic quantum pumping of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the external potential , generated by the saws and by the control gates , is viewed as a perturbation acting on a coherent quantum wire @xcite .",
    "the resulting `` staircase '' structure of the acoustoelectric current and its dependence on model parameters within this approach have been studied in refs .   and  , using the adiabatic approximation in conjunction with an exactly solvable one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding model .",
    "this theory yields a crossover from a non - quantized acoustoelectric transport to the quantized limit as the saw power and/or the static barrier height are increased .",
    "although this picture requires the coulomb interaction in order to set the energy scale of the problem @xcite , the main qualitative features of the experiment can be reproduced within a model of non - interacting spinless electrons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results of ref .  .",
    "the mechanism of quantized transport is elucidated by using a resonance approximation for adiabatic pumping @xcite .",
    "both current quantization and transmission resonances are determined by the quasi - bound states of the electrons captured by a moving potential well .",
    "new effects , including the influence of a counter propagating saw , static potential asymmetry and source - drain bias on the number and shape of the quantization steps , are considered .",
    "we compare our qualitative conclusions with the published theoretical and experimental results .",
    "in particular , tuning the amplitude and the phase of a weak secondary saw is found to improve the quantization by accordance with an earlier experimental report @xcite .",
    "for this effect , we propose a new quantitative relation between the phase and the amplitude of the optimal secondary saw which can be easily checked using existing experimental setups .",
    "the results are presented as follows . in section  [ secmodel ] , we describe the model @xcite and the algorithms for calculating the adiabatic current . in section  [ secsteps ] , we explain the formation of the integer plateaus and make quantitative analytic estimates by applying the resonance approximation @xcite to the model of ref .  .",
    "building on these results we analyze in sec .",

    "[ secdiscussion ] , together with several conclusions .",
    "the model consists of a nanostructure and two 1d leads connecting its ends to the electronic reservoirs ( fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the leads are modelled by two chains of sites with vanishing on - site energies and nearest - neighbors hopping amplitudes @xmath7 .",
    "an electron moving in the lead has the energy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wave vector and @xmath10 is the lattice constant .",
    "the nanostructure represents the saw - affected part of the quasi-1d channel .",

    "the time - dependence of the on - site energies @xmath16 reflects the saw - induced piezoelectric potential , which is responsible for the pumping effect .",

    ", @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the gate voltage ( in energy units ) , @xmath25 is the wave - vector of the saw , and @xmath26 is the amplitude of the piezoelectric potential , induced by a saw running from left to right ( for @xmath27 ) . the origin of the spatial coordinate @xmath28 is chosen to be at the middle of the channel .",
    "the adiabatically - pumped current flowing between two reservoirs with equal electrochemical potentials @xmath29 , is usually calculated using the brouwer formula @xcite .",
    "we use an equivalent formalism , developed in ref .  , which also includes the effects of a finite bias @xmath30 .",
    "the total instantaneous current , @xmath31 , of spinless electrons from the lead @xmath32 into the nanostructure consists of two parts , @xmath33 .",

    "as discussed in detail in the following section , these restrictions become significant for the non - quantized transport , but have little influence on the shape of the current quantization steps . in all the cases in which the resonance approximation is inadequate , we rely on the results of an exact calculation .",

    "this ` quantization ' can be related to the structure of the transmission resonances @xcite .",
    "we first establish this relation quantitatively and then use it to analyze various aspects of the model .",
    "the calculation of the pumping curve can be visualized using a diagram like the one shown in fig .",

    "the first steps are robust and do not change their positions as @xmath89 and @xmath84 are varied ( except for a trivial shift of @xmath65 ) .",
    "the top of the pumping curve and the spikes are more vulnerable : as @xmath89 is increased , the upper steps and the sharp features shift and become rounded .",
    "narrow spikes disappear for @xmath90 and @xmath91 close to the center of the band [ see curve ( c ) in the right panel of fig .",

    "[ resonancecalc ] , the finite resonance width effects are most important in this region .",
    "indeed , the discrepancies between the exact and the approximate curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are well correlated with the fact that the shifts and the widths of the resonance levels for a tight - binding model are proportional to @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively [ eq .  ] .",
    "we have made a similar comparison between the exact integration and the resonance approximation for several sets of `` internal '' parameters , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the most important conclusion is that the stair - case structure of the pumping curve can be reliably estimated using the resonance approximation .",
    "hence , we will utilize this useful technique in the following as a source for various analytic estimates that will be further checked versus exact calculations .      for the lowest part of the spectrum ( which is relevant for the quantized transport ) , the on - site energies can be treated as a potential function of a continuous spatial coordinate @xmath98 . for @xmath99 , only one minimum of this potential can be located inside the saw - affected part of the channel .",

    "a new pair of resonances and another step in the pumping curve emerge .",
    "the plateaus are rather flat because the resonant states at the loading ( unloading ) moments are well localized at the entrance ( exit ) of the channel .",
    "the number of quantization steps , @xmath114 , is limited by two competing mechanisms .",
    "the first limit is set by the number , @xmath115 , of localized states that can be transferred below the fermi energy .",

    "quantized electronic transport , driven by saw s , has been considered in several recent theoretical studies @xcite . here",

    "several of models @xcite make a distinction between electrons _",
    "already localized _ in a moving potential well ( dynamic quantum dot ) and those belonging to the fermi sea .",
    "the current is then calculated by considering the loss of electrons from the dynamic quantum dot at the stage of its formation @xcite and/or its subsequent motion @xcite .",
    "this approach presupposes the formation of the dynamic quantum dot , but does not require it to be at thermodynamic equilibrium with the reservoirs at all times .",
    "moreover , all the quantization error mechanisms within these models ( gradual back - tunneling @xcite , non - adiabaticity at the formation stage @xcite and non - equilibrium dynamics during the transfer @xcite ) consider electrons with energies that can significantly exceed the fermi energy in the remote reservoirs .",
    "our adiabatic quantum calculation @xcite differs from these studies in two significant aspects : ( i ) the formation of a dynamic quantum dot is not a necessary condition for the calculation of the acoustoelectric current .",
    "we do identify , however , the localized electronic states ( whenever such states are present ) via the resonance approximation and confirm that they are responsible for the quantized transport .",
    "( ii ) in the adiabatic pumping approximation @xcite , the time - dependent potential never excites the carrier by a finite amount of energy away from the fermi level @xcite .",
    "therefore , we never observe quantization steps when the moving potential well rises above the fermi level upon passing through the middle of the channel .",
    "we find the numerical calculations by maksym @xcite to be the closest to our study .",
    "he considers a 1d single - particle model with a pumping potential similar to our eq .  .",
    "the current at the quantization plateaus is found to be carried by the lowest energy states of the local potential minimum , in accordance with our results .",
    "the quantization accuracy in our approach is determined by two factors which we expect to become experimentally relevant for sufficiently low tunnelling barriers .",

    "compared to the predictions of the loading / unloading scenario ( sec .",
    "[ resonancecalc ] ) , this effect further degrades the flatness of the quantization ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig1]b , [ refsym ] and [ bias]d ) and eventually leads to the breakdown of the quantized transport as the channel opens ( sec .",
    "[ biassec ] ) .",
    "we have not considered explicit coulomb interactions between electrons in the depleted part of the channel , which set the energy scale of the problem .",
    "one can make a naive estimate of the level spacing @xmath112 , which in the continuous limit is @xcite @xmath267 . using typical experimental values @xcite for the saw amplitude @xmath268 , wavelength @xmath269 and gaas bulk effective mass @xmath270 , one gets @xmath271 , which is an order of magnitude less that the distance between the quantization steps observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be qualitatively understood on a mean - field level : if an electron is captured by the moving potential minimum , its unscreened electric field makes the potential well seen by the other electrons much shallower , and thus increases the spacing @xmath112 between resonances by the amount of the charging energy @xcite . such a picture is also supported by the numerical calculation of a two - electron problem by gumbs and co - workers @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that the effective values for the parameters of our model can be estimated from a self - consistent realistic calculation .    in conclusion , we have considered a simple model for saw - driven adiabatic pumping of electrons through a quasi-1d quantum wire .",
    "a stair - case structure of the acoustoelectric current has been mapped onto the instantaneous energy spectrum of the pumping potential .",
    "numerical calculations and analytic estimates confirm the experimentally observed behavior of the acoustoelectric current as function of the saw amplitude , wavelength , source - drain bias , and the parameters of a weak counter - propagating beam .",
