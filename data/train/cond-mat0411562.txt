    "in recent years spintronics and magneto - electronic devices have been a major research topic , biased in part by the prospect of new technological applications in information processing based on the simultaneous use both the electron s spin and charge degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "all spintronic devices depend on driven spin currents between different subsystems , which is why a deep understanding of these spin - currents is essential for this field of research .",
    "a naive identification of total transfer of angular momentum with the spin - polarized charge current passed through a junction , @xmath0 , neglects the possibility of spin transfer due to exchange couplings .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive an expression for the spin current through a tunnel junction , that is suitable to describe interacting electron systems , such as quantum dots , and that explicitly demonstrates the two different contributions to the spin current .",
    "we start our discussion with the calculation of the spin current between a ferromagnetic lead @xmath1 and an island @xmath2 via a tunnel contact . in this first section",
    ", we do not specify the electronic structure of the island yet , i.e. , any kind of many - body effects or couplings of the island to other leads are included .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a tunnel system is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the fermion creation operators in the lead and @xmath5 are the corresponding operator for the island .",
    "in the lead ( island ) we label the momentum states of the electrons with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and the spin with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .        starting from this hamiltonian",
    "we calculate the spin current in close analogy to the derivation of the charge current by meir and wingreen for interacting electron systems @xcite .",
    "if the spin is a conserved quantity , the time derivative of the total spin in the lead equals the spin current through the tunnel barrier @xmath12 . in the heisenberg picture ,",
    "the time evolution of the spin operator @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 $ ] , which yields    @xmath15    where we introduced the keldysh green s functions @xmath16 .",
    "by use of a dyson equation @xcite we can replace the latter with ( free ) green s functions @xmath17 of the lead and green s functions @xmath18 of the island . by choosing the magnetization direction @xmath19 as spin - quantization axis , the lead greens functions @xmath20 are diagonal in the spin index .",
    "the lead green s functions are then @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "there @xmath25 stands for the fermi distribution function in the lead @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "assuming , furthermore , that tunnel events conserve the spin of the electrons , we substitute the tunnel matrix elements by @xmath28 , and define the spin - dependent transition rates @xmath29 . after a lengthy but straightforward calculation , the spin current can be written as @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\        & & + { \\bm\\sigma}^{}_{\\gamma\\delta}(\\gamma^\\gamma_{q , p}-\\gamma^\\delta_{q , p})\\left [ f^+_{\\rm l}(\\omega)\\,(g^{\\rm ret}_{q\\delta , p\\gamma}+g^{\\rm adv}_{q\\delta , p\\gamma})+\\frac{1}{i\\pi}{\\int}^\\prime \\!\\!de\\,\\frac{g_{q\\delta , p\\gamma}^<(e)}{e-\\omega}\\,\\right]\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the central most general result of our calculation .",
    "since we did not specify the green s functions @xmath31 of the island yet , the expression for the spin current can be used for many situation , including strongly - correlated systems such as quantum dots @xcite .    by comparison with the expression of the charge current derived by meir and wingreen @xcite for nonmagnetic systems ,",
    "we identify the first line of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) with a spin - polarized charge current .",
    "the origin of the spin - current contribution in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) is the exchange interaction between lead and island .",
    "if the island does posses a magnetic moment , due to spin accumulation or ferromagnetic order , this moment couples to the magnetization of the lead and both precess around each other @xcite .",
    "this exchange coupling changes the average spin on each side of the tunnel junction , and therefore it must also appear as contribution to the spin current crossing the tunnel barrier . in the latter case ,",
    "the transfered angular moment is perpendicular to the magnetic moments of lead and island , which is sometimes described by `` spin mixing conductances '' @xcite .",
    "for concreteness , we restrict the following discussion to the special case , that the island is an itinerant ferromagnet . thereby the direction of magnetization @xmath32 of the island",
    "encloses a finite angle @xmath33 with the lead magnetization direction .",
    "we further assume , that the island is large , to be also described as a reservoir in thermal equilibrium .",
    "due to the non - collinear magnetization directions , the green s function of the island is non - diagonal in the spin space @xmath34 with the su(2 ) rotations @xmath35 .    to simplify the result further",
    ", we assume that the absolute value of the tunnel matrix elements @xmath36 is independent of the momentum index .",
    "then we can replace the transition rates @xmath37 by the spin - resolved density of states @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "after performing all spin summations , we get in lowest - order in the tunnel coupling @xmath40\\chi_{\\rm l}(\\omega)\\rho_{\\rm i}(\\omega)\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\lambda_2(\\omega)=[f^-_{\\rm l}(\\omega)f^+_{\\rm i}(\\omega)-f^+_{\\rm l}(\\omega)f^-_{\\rm",

    "the third term shows the typical structure for a precession movement . in the approach of spin dependent circuit theory @xcite",
    "this spin current contribution corresponds to the imaginary part of the spin - mixing conductance .",
    "a very pronounced effect of a spin current is current - induced magnetization reversal @xcite . however , there it is difficult to selectively address the spin - current contribution arising from the exchange interaction .",
    "the latter goal can be achieved , e.g. , in measuring the charge current through a single - level quantum dot connected to two ferromagnetic leads .",
    "a current forced through such a quantum - dot spin valve will accumulate a non - equilibrium spin on the dot .",
    "this spin is sensitive to the exchange field generated by the leads .",
    "its precession is predicted to be visible in the magneto - resistance of the device @xcite .",
