    "to date , a small number of exoplanet atmospheres have been characterized via low - resolution spectroscopy from primary and secondary transits and direct imaging . recently a novel technique to detect exoplanetary dayside atmosphere",
    "was successfully accomplished with high - dispersion spectroscopy . in this technique",
    ", high - dispersion ( @xmath5 ) spectra of the exoplanet + star are analyzed to detect the planet signature .",
    "computing the cross - correlation function between the spectra and a template of molecular lines as a function of the doppler shifts , allows separation of the planet signature from the stellar absorption lines and the telluric lines .",
    "hence , it detects the change in the radial component of the planet s orbital motion , i.e. , planetary radial velocity ( prv ) .",
    "the technique provides precious information on atmospheric compositions .",
    "thus far , the 3 - 5 @xmath6 detections of carbon monoxide and water of nearby hot jupiters have been reported using this technique with crires / vlt and nirspec / keck .",
    "investigated the cross - correlation signals for molecules not yet detected , methane , acetylene , and hydrogen cyanide .",
    "the application of this technique to reflected light was also proposed by @xcite , assuming extremely large telescopes ( elts ) .",
    "furthermore , such precise measurements of the prv will also provide complementary physics , for instance , planetary rotation @xcite .",
    "the targets of the spectroscopic direct detection are currently limited to planets with low star - planet contrast , i.e. , hot jupiters with the equilibrium temperature @xmath7 k. an open question is how to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectroscopic direct detection in order to apply this technique to other types of planets beyond hot jupiters . to use larger telescopes",
    "is , of course , one of the solutions .",
    "elts can simply provide an s / n that is @xmath8 3 times larger than that of current observations .",
    "improvement in efficiency of high - dispersion instruments will also increase the s / n . beyond the collecting power ,",
    "if the photon noise from the host star can be reduced , the high - dispersion observations of the exoplanets will be of wider application .",
    "high - contrast instruments for direct imaging are designed exactly for the reduction of stellar flux .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the possibility of spectroscopic corongraphy , that is , an application of the high - contrast instruments to the spectroscopic direct detection technique .",
    "it is extremely difficult for the coronagraph to be capable of separating the star and the planet near 1 @xmath9 , corresponding to 0.1 - 0.2 au at 10 pc for the elts .",
    "however , even if the coronagraph does not reduce the stellar halo at the planet location , but the full contrast difference even a slight reduction benefits this technique . in this paper , we show the visible nuller , as an example of coronagraphs , with the elts significantly reducing the relative noise of the planetary radial velocimetry of the dayside emission if the extreme adoptive optics ( exao ) works well .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first summarize the visible nuller and define the quantities that describe its benefit for this use in section 2.1 .",
    "we derive the analytical expressions of these quantities as a function of the finite effect of the stellar radius and the tip - tilt contamination in sections 2.2 - 2.3 . in section 3 ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations assuming a 30 m telescope with a future exao system and consider the speckle noise .",
    "we discuss the feasibility of the spectroscopic coronagraph for nearby exoplanets . in section 4",
    ", we also consider ways to further increase the s / n for future studies , as well as the limitations of our techniques .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we analytically estimate the gain of the spectroscopic coronagraph .",
    "the effects of the stellar angular radius and tip - tilt errors are included in the analytical expressions of the gain in the s / n .",
    "we use these expressions to analyze the simulation results in section 4 .    throughout this paper , we utilize the visible nuller as the coronagraph among various types of coronagraphs . although we do not claim that the nuller is the best choice for the spectroscopic coronagraph , there are several reasons to use the visible nuller to demonstrate the concept : its simple analytical formulation , small inner working angle ( iwa ) , and compatibility with segmented mirrors for elts .      the visible nuller , or the visible nulling coronagraph , is the nulling interferometer for a single telescope ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which divides a single aperture into two or more apertures , inserts @xmath10 relative phase shifts , and combines the beams .",
    "these processes cancel out an on - axis source ( i.e. a host star ) by a destructive interference and leaves an off - axis source ( a planet ) unnulled . here , we briefly summarize several important features of the nuller . throughout this paper ,",
    "we consider the simplest two - beam nuller .",
    "the detailed description of the visible two - beam nuller is given in the appendix .",
    "the intensity transmittance , @xmath11 , on the sky plane @xmath12 , for the two - beam nuller is displayed in figure [ fig : transm ] .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14-axis are position angles normalized by the angular length of a fringe , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the amount of shear .",
    "the transmittance varies from 0 % on axis to 100 % for @xmath17 along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "hence , @xmath18 can be regarded as a characteristic angle of the two - beam nuller .",
    "we assume that a planet is on the @xmath13 axis of the nuller .",
    "this assumption is the most optimistic case when the azimuth angle of the planet is unknown . in general",
    ", one needs to determine the roll angle with the strongest signal by observing several angles , or one can utilize the astrometric detection of the planet to determine the adequate roll angle .",

    "the right panel displays an enlarged view of the left one around the star .",
    "solid and dotted circles show the stellar disk of the mock 55 cnc and a 1 mas circle as the typical tip - tilt error , respectively .",
    "[ fig : transm ] ]    we define the normalized separation of the planet by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular separation of the host star and the planet .",
    "we also define the ratio of @xmath23 to the stellar angular radius , @xmath24 , which quantifies the easiness to suppress the finite effect of the stellar radius , by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the stellar radius and @xmath27 is a star - planet separation .",
    "we can relate the radiative equilibrium temperature of the planet to @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stellar effective temperature , @xmath31 is the bond albedo , and @xmath32 is the efficiency of the heat transport ( usually @xmath33 ) .",

    ". then we can write @xmath47 and @xmath48 by the products of the transmittance function @xmath51 and the instrumental throughput of the nuller @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the intensity transmittance function at the positions of the host star and the planet , respectively .",
    "we assume that the total throughput of the nuller is equivalent to the deficit of aperture , corresponding to the ratio between the overlapped area of the beams and the effective area of the telescope ( see eq . [ [ eq : tra ] ] ) . hence , @xmath52 depends on the ratio of the telescope diameter and the shear @xmath56 .",
    "we ignore other factors in the nuller system that may decrease the throughput , such as the throughput of the optical system .    from equation ( [ eq : snma ] ) , the nuller increases ( or decreases ) the s / n of the prv as @xmath57 where we quantify the benefit to use the nullers by the gain @xmath58 in the s / n as @xmath59 where @xmath60 depends on the transmittance pattern of the system of the nuller , the configuration of the star and the planet on the sky plane , and the stellar radius .",
    "the nuller changes the apparent magnitude of a star @xmath61 to an _ effective _ apparent magnitude as , @xmath62 we define an _ effective _ star - planet contrast by , @xmath63      if the phase aberration is negligible , the transmittances of photons from the star and planet are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 takes an average over the stellar disk and @xmath66 is the angular vector of the planet .",

    "one may intuitively understand this situation through the right panel of figure [ fig : transm ] .",
    "this panel shows the stellar angular radius ( solid circle ) for the nearby warm jupiter system , 55 cnc b , and our fiducial tip - tilt error 1 mas on the transmittance map .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig : etatau ] displays @xmath60 as a function of the planet position , @xmath83 , and the tip - tilt error @xmath84 including the effect of the stellar finite radius with @xmath85 , and roughly corresponding to the ratio of a g - type stellar radius to semi - major axis of warm jupiters or neptunes . recalling that the gain in the s / n , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , several to several tens of gain in the s / n is expected in the wide range of @xmath84 and @xmath83 from the analytical estimates with the effects of the tip - tilt and the stellar radius . for instance , a typical set of for nearby warm jupiters for @xmath88 mas , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 yields @xmath91 .",
    "we also show @xmath79 in the right panel , which disregards the effect of the stellar radius ( eq . [ [ eq : app2ttslim ] ] ) .",
    "as shown in these panels , it makes little difference in the gain if the tip - tilt error is larger than the stellar angular radius ( above the blue line in the left panel ) .",
    "however , the gain under the blue line in the left panel is significantly suppressed by the stellar radius . for the extreme case of the very small tip - tilt error",
    ", the stellar radius dominates the gain , though it might be premature to consider such a case .",
    "hence , the theoretical maximum gain of the s / n for the extreme case is @xmath92 for the warm jupiter , neptune , and super - earth .",
    "in the previous section , we analytically estimated the gain in s / n considering the tip - tilt error and the stellar finite radius .",
    "however , we still have other possible effects .",
    "one important noise is the speckle due to the phase aberration .",
    "moreover , we only consider the instant tip - tilt error in the previous section . in reality , the tip - tilt error and the speckle vary from time to time .",
    "there are also other minor effects of the finiteness of the sheared telescope , the secondary mirror , the spiders , and the extract region .",
    "since these effects are difficult to be expressed analytically , we perform mock observations to examine and analyze these effects with the aid of the analytical expressions described in section 2 .",
    "the assumptions of the mock observations are summarized in table [ tab : sim ] .",
    "we assume a 30 m telescope with a next generation of exao for the wavefront errors after the exao .",
    "we use the k band because a low star - planet contrast is expected and there are a lot of strong molecular lines of carbon monoxide and methane in this band .",

    "the separations of 0.5@xmath9 , 1@xmath9 , and 1.5@xmath9 are shown on the upper line of figure [ fig : etametapc ] . if defining the iwa of the spectroscopic coronagraphs by the angle so that the gain is conveniently twice ( @xmath182 ) , the iwa for the simulation ( rms = 1 mas ) , and that for rms = 0.3 mas , are @xmath183 0.5 @xmath9 and 0.25 @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the iwa of the coronagraph for direct imaging is classically defined by the angle with 50 % transmissivity , corresponding to @xmath184 for the two - beam nuller .",
    "the shear of the nuller used for direct imaging is set to 10 - 20 % of the telescope diameter to obtain resolved images .",
    "the iwa of the nuller for direct imaging is typically @xmath185 . for our setting , @xmath186 yields @xmath187 .",
    "the spectroscopic coronagraph achieves a small iwa by extending the shear to 30 - 50 % of the telescope diameter .",
    "as described above , the suppression of the tip - tilt error and the improvement of the low - order wavefront sensing are crucial for our technique . though further discussion of improvement of the exao is beyond the scope of this paper , we briefly mention several factors that we did not consider in our simulation .",
    "one of reasons why our exao simulation does not achieve @xmath188 mas of the tip - tilt error is the chromatic aberration  the use of different bands for sensing ( i band ) and science ( k band ) .",
    "the wavefront sensing with a band that is close to the science band will improve the low - order aberration .",
    "the tip - tilt sensors with science lights under development will improve the situation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they proved that the sensor can reduce the tip - tilt within @xmath189 in the laboratory experiment and the theoretical limitation is @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "for instance , the stellar light rejected by the lyot stop for the wavefront sensing can be used for the wavefront sensing with the science band .    in this paper",
    ", we have regarded the semimajor axis as the angular separation of the planets , i.e. , we have assumed that the planet is located at the phase angle near @xmath191 .",
    "the planets with less efficient redistribution of heat at this location have less emissivity than those at the far side of the star ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "this effect might reduce the benefit of the spectroscopic coronagraph",
    ". however , the prv measurement for various phase angles is particularly important for the complementary applications of the prv , such as the detection of the planetary spin or the zonal winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "though we have assumed the warm / hot planets close to a host star , the spectroscopic coronagraph is also applicable to the self - luminous planets .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrated the concept of the spectroscopic coronagraphy for future spectroscopic direct detection .",
    "we assumed the visible nuller as the spectroscopic coronagraph .",
    "as shown in the paper , the tip - tilt error and low - order wavefront control is crucial for this technique . the visible nuller with the exao in the next generation elts gain an s / n that is three to six times larger for the prv detection of the nearby planets at @xmath193 au .",
    "we showed that the spectra of warm jupiters in @xmath194 au and warm neptunes in @xmath195 au are detectable with a 30 m telescope and future exao .",
    "if we can utilize the more progressive exao with the tip - tilt rms @xmath196 mas , the improvement in the s / n is more than an order of magnitude and the spectrum of warm super - earth - sized planets will be detectable .",
    "this paper demonstrates the importance of the tip - tilt and low - order wavefront control of exao on elts , and shows that doing so will expand the range of application of the planetary radial velocimetry .",
