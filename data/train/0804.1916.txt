    "in a modelling of the supernova explosion , two main problems arise  @xcite .",
    "first , the mechanism of the damped shock wave stimulation has not been developed completely yet .",
    "it is believed that the explosion can not be realized without the shock wave revival .",
    "let us remind , that the main reason of the shock - wave damping is the energy loss by the nuclei dissociation .",
    "the second problem is that even in the case of the `` successful '' theoretical supernova explosion , the energy release turns out to be essentialy less than the observed kinetic energy of the envelope @xmath4 erg .",
    "that is known as the foe problem ( ten to the fifty one ergs ) .",
    "thus , it is necessary for the self - consistent description of the explosion dynamics , that the neutrino flux , outgoing from the supernova core , could transfer by some mechanism the energy @xmath4 erg to the supernova envelope .",
    "a possible solution of those problems , first proposed by a.  dar  @xcite , was based on the assumption of the existence of the neutrino magnetic moment being not too small .",
    "a huge number of left - handed electron neutrinos @xmath5 is produced in the collapsing supernova core , and a part of them could convert into right - handed neutrinos due to the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with plasma electrons and protons .",
    "these right - handed neutrinos , being sterile with respect to the weak interaction , freely escape from the central part of the supernova , if the neutrino magnetic moment is not too large , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the bohr magneton . in the supernova envelope ,",
    "a part of these neutrinos can flip back to the left - handed ones due to the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with a magnetic field .",
    "it is now believed that the magnetic field strength in the supernova envelope could achieve the critical value @xmath8 g  .",
    "@xmath9 is an elementary charge . ] and even exceed it .",
    "the produced left - handed neutrinos , being absorbed in beta - processes , @xmath10 , can transfer an additional energy to the supernova envelope .    in our opinion ,",
    "a reason arises at the present time to reconsider in more detail the dar s mechanism . in the recent paper  @xcite we have shown that the evaluations of the right - handed neutrino flux and the luminosity from the supernova core were essentially understated in the previous papers on the subject .    in this paper",
    ", we perform an analysis of the two - step conversion of the neutrino helicity , @xmath0 , under the supernova conditions , and of the possibility of the damped shock wave stumulation by this process .",
    "the process of the neutrino chirality flip @xmath11 under the physical conditions of the supernova core was investigated in the papers  @xcite .",
    "the process is possible due to the interaction of the dirac neutrino magnetic moment with a virtual plasmon , which can be both produced and absorbed : @xmath12 the detailed calculation of the plasma polarization effect on the photon propagator reveals , in particular , that the contribution of the proton component of plasma is dominant . as a result a new astrophysical bound on the electron - type neutrino magnetic moment was established  @xcite from the supernova @xmath13 data :    @xmath14    which improved the existed constraint by the factor of 2 .    particularly , a function @xmath15 defining the spectrum of the right - handed neutrino energies , was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in other words",
    ", this function defines the number of right - handed neutrinos emitted per 1 mev of the neutrino energy spectrum , per unit time , from the unit volume of the supernova core : @xmath16    the function @xmath15 also determines the spectral density of the right - handed neutrino luminosity of the supernova core :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the volume of the area emitting neutrinos .",
    "the function @xmath19 was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is shown in the figure  [ fig : emissivity ] for the typical supernova core parameter values : the temperature @xmath20 30 mev , the electron and neutrino chemical potentials @xmath21 300 mev , @xmath22 160 mev , the volume @xmath23 and for the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath24 .",
    "30 mev and for @xmath24.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the integral luminosity of the right - handed neutrinos appeared to be the following : @xmath25 hereafter we use for the definiteness the neutrino magnetic moment value @xmath24 .",
    "on the one hand , this value is sufficiently small to avoid a distortion of the supernova dynamics . on the other hand",
    ", it is large enough to provide the required level of the luminosity  ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "if the right - handed neutrino energy was converted into the energy of the left - handed neutrinos , for example due to the well - known mechanism of the spin oscillations , then during the typical stagnation time of the shock wave of the order of some tenths of a second , an additional energy of order @xmath3 erg could be injected into the supernova envelope .",
    "we consider a part of the supernova envelope between the neutrinosphere ( of the radius @xmath27 ) and the shock wave stagnation region ( of the radius @xmath28 ) . by the present conceptions , typical values of @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 vary rather slightly during the stagnation time .",
    "these values could be estimated as @xmath29 2050  km , @xmath30 100200  km . if a sufficiently large magnetic field @xmath2 g exists in this region , then the spin oscillation phenomenon takes place , which can be of the resonant type at certain conditions .",
    "it is convenient to illustrate the magnetic field influence on a neutrino with a magnetic moment by means of the equation of the neutrino helicity evolution in an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "taking into account the additional energy @xmath31 , which the left - handed electron type neutrino @xmath5 acquires in medium , the equation of the helicity evolution can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath32 % \\left (   \\begin{array}{c }   \\nu_r \\\\",
    "\\nu_l   \\end{array }   \\right ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq : evolution}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 here , the ratio @xmath34 is the nucleon density , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the densities of electrons , protons and neutrino respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the transverse component of the magnetic field with respect to the neutrino movement direction , @xmath38 is proportional to the unit matrix and is inessential for our analysis .",
    "the expression  ( [ eq : c_l ] ) for the additional energy of left - handed neutrinos @xmath31 deserves a special analysis .",
    "it is remarkable that the possibility exists for this value to be zero just in the region of the supernova envelope we are interested in . and in turn this is the condition of the resonant transition @xmath26 .",
    "taking into account that the neutrino density in the supernova envelope is sufficiently small , one may neglect the value @xmath39 in the expression  ( [ eq : c_l ] ) , that gives the condition of the resonance in the form @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that the values @xmath41 which are realized in the supernova envelope , typical for the collapsing matter , are : @xmath42 0.40.5 .",
    "however , the shock wave causes the nuclei dissociation and makes the substance to be more transparent for neutrinos .",
    "this leads to the so - called `` short '' neutrino outburst and consequently to the significiant matter deleptonization in this region .",
    "according to the existing conceptions , a typical gap arises in the radial distribution of the value @xmath41 , where @xmath41 may fall down to the value @xmath43 , see , for example  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the dependence @xmath44 is represented in the figure  [ fig : gap ] .",
    "thus , a point necessarily exists where @xmath41 takes the value of @xmath45 .",
    "it is remarkable , that only one such point appears , with @xmath46 , see  @xcite .",
    "about 0.1 to 0.2 s after the shock formation , with the typical gap caused by the `` short '' neutrino outburst , see e.g. _ buras et al .",
    ", 2005_. the dashed line corresponds to the value @xmath40.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    notice , that the condition @xmath40 is the necessary but still not the sufficient one for the resonant conversion @xmath26 .",
    "the realization is also necessary of the so - called adiabatic condition .",
    "this means that the diagonal element @xmath31 in the equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) , at least , should not exceed the nondiagonal element @xmath47 , when the shift is made from the resonance point at the distance of the order of the oscillations length .",
    "this leads to the condition  @xcite : @xmath48 the typical parameter values in the considered area are the following , see  @xcite : @xmath49 for the magnetic field value , providing the realization of the resonance condition , one can find : @xmath50 thus , the performed analysis shows that the dar scenario of the two - step conversion of the neutrino helicity , @xmath0 , can be realized , if the value of the neutrino magnetic moment is in the interval @xmath51 and under the condition that the magnetic field of the scale @xmath52 g exists in the region @xmath53 . during the shock wave stagnation time",
    "@xmath54 0.20.4 sec the additional energy can be injected into this region , of the order of @xmath55 which is just enough for the problem solution .",
    "we have re - analysed the two - step conversion of the neutrino helicity , @xmath0 , under the supernova conditions .",
    "as we have shown , this conversion process could provide an additional energy of the order of @xmath3 erg which can be injected into the region between the neutrinosphere and the shock - wave stagnation area , @xmath53 , during the typical stagnation time of the order of some tenths of a second .",
    "this energy could be sufficient for stumulation of the damped shock wave .    the conditions for the realization of this scenario appear to be not very rigid .",
    "the dirac neutrino magnetic moment should belong to the interval @xmath1 , and the magnetic field @xmath2 g should exist in the region @xmath53 .",
