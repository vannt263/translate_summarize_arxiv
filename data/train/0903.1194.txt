    "the action of the coulomb force in pp scattering can be rigorously treated using the vincent - phatak method  @xcite .",
    "we propose an alternative manner using a screened coulomb force , despite the well know fact that the screening limit does not exist .",
    "namely the pp on - shell scattering amplitude acquires an oscillating phase factor if the screening radius goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "this phase factor is known and can be removed , a step known in that context under the name renormalization . however , as we shall show , if one is interested in the pp observables ( not in the phase shifts ) where that phase factor drops out , all scattering observables can be obtained in the standard framework of short range interactions .",
    "this will be demonstrated in section ii for suitably chosen screening radii .    in view of a forthcoming paper  @xcite related to the pd system",
    ", we further investigate in section iii properties of the screened 3-dimensional coulomb t - matrix @xmath0 .",
    "this t - matrix is a solution of the 3-dimensional 2-body ls equation driven by the screened coulomb potential .",
    "namely to catch the full action of the coulomb force in the pd system a partial wave truncated pp t - matrix is insufficient and the complete 3-dimensional coulomb t - matrix has to be used .",
    "analytical properties of that screened coulomb t - matrix , off - the - energy - shell , half - shell and on - shell have been studied in the past  @xcite .",
    "these investigations , however , mostly rely on insights gained for fixed partial wave states .",
    "the mathematical rigor in the summation of the partial wave sum to infinity leaves room for improvement .",
    "therefore we felt that a numerical study is justified to verify statements given there : the screening limit of @xmath1 exists for @xmath2 and coincides with the unscreened pure coulomb force expression , which is known analytically  @xcite and references therein ; that screening limit exhibits a discontinuity if @xmath3 approaches @xmath4 from above or below ; the screening limit of the on - shell t - matrix @xmath5 approaches the analytically known unscreened coulomb on - shell t - matrix up to a given infinitely oscillating phase factor .",
    "here we want to numerically investigate at which r - values these limits are reached with adequate accuracy .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "let @xmath6 be the screened coulomb potential between 2 protons normalised such that @xmath6 turns into the pure pp coulomb potential for @xmath7 , the screening radius , going to infinity",
    ". together with the strong interaction v this determines the 2-body pp t - matrix via the ls equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the free propagator .",
    "that equation is solved at the @xmath10 c.m .",
    "energy @xmath11 projected on a set of partial wave basis states @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the relative momentum , orbital angular momentum , total spin , total angular momentum and its magnetic quantum number .",
    "the total isospin quantum numbers for two protons are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to the on - the - energy - shell t - matrix element @xmath17 where the pauli principle dictates @xmath18 and we took @xmath19 to be conserved .",
    "the full 3-dimensional antisymmetrized on - shell t - matrix is given as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the individual spin magnetic quantum numbers and @xmath22 the initial and final relative momenta .",
    "the standard partial wave decomposition leads to @xmath23    the strong force can be neglected beyond a certain @xmath24 and there only the screened coulomb t - matrix @xmath25 is present , which is diagonal in @xmath26 and independent of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in a well known manner one",
    "adds and subtracts a finite sum up to @xmath24 with @xmath29 only and this completes the infinite sum over @xmath28 containing only @xmath29 .",
    "that infinite sum is identical to the 3-dimensional antisymmetric screened coulomb t - matrix .",
    "thus ( [ 4 ] ) turns into @xmath30    now as is well known  @xcite the limit of that expression does not exist for @xmath31 . in that limit each term in (",
    "[ 5 ] ) acquires the same infinitely oscillating factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is given below .",
    "if one is interested in scattering phase shifts it is unavoidable to keep track of this oscillating factor which in that context runs under the name renormalization  @xcite .",
    "however , if one is interested in the pp observables , the cross section and all sorts of spin observables ( note @xmath33 is independent of spin magnetic quantum numbers ) , where the on - shell t - matrix appears together with its complex conjugate , the oscillating factor drops out . in that case",
    "one does not even has to know the analytical form of @xmath33 .",
    "it is sufficient to know that the limit of large screening radius generates just a phase factor .",
    "this is the main message of this section : the pp observables based on the strong and the screened coulomb force can be calculated without renormalization using standard short range methods .",
    "though not explicitly stated in @xcite this insight is in the spirit of these authors .",
    "it remains to establish the values of the parameter @xmath7 at which the observables get independent of @xmath7 .",
    "based on ( [ 5 ] ) all pp - scattering observables are given by well known analytic expressions  @xcite , here , however , we use a more modern nomenclature for the various spin observables  @xcite .",
    "we use the following screening form which depends on two parameters , the screening radius @xmath7 and the power @xmath34 : @xmath35    at a given value @xmath34 the pure coulomb potential results for @xmath36 .",

    "considering only the screened coulomb force ( [ eq.2 ] ) the leading term in ( [ ls ] ) is given by @xmath45 by a simple partial integration it can be shown that this matrix element approaches the n - independent limit @xmath46 therefore for suitably large @xmath7-values the leading term and thus the solution of the ls equation ( [ ls ] ) will approach a n - independent limit .    in figs .",

    "the results of renormalization are striking , especially for the imaginary part of the half - shell screened t - matrix .",

    "the effect of renormalization is very pronounced for the imaginary part .",
    "it is negative without renormalization and shows a strong dependence on the screening radii @xmath7 .",
    "after renormalization and for sufficiently large @xmath86-values it perfectly overlaps with the imaginary part of the pure coulomb on - shell amplitude . at forward angles , which corresponds to @xmath61 close to 1 , @xmath102  fm is required to reach good agreement with the pure on - shell coulomb t - matrix .",
    "we numerically solved the 3-dimensional ls equation for a general off - shell screened coulomb t - matrix with different types of screening .",
    "that t - matrix taken on - shell together with a finite number of partial wave projected t - matrices generated by the sum of the screened coulomb force and the nuclear force and corrected for the partial wave projected screened pure coulomb t - matrix leads to correct pp observables at suitably chosen finite screening radii .",
    "the renormalization phases drop out automatically in the pp observables since they are products of the full t - matrix and its complex conjugate .",
    "thus renormalization is not required and even the knowledge of the renormalization phase is not required when calculating observables .",
