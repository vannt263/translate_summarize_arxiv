    "we discuss observations of the young star cluster ngc  602 associated with the highly structured hii region n90 @xcite .",
    "ngc  602 is located in a region of low stellar density in the periphery of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) in an area known as the `` wing '' of the smc , which stretches between shapley s wing @xcite and the main body of the galaxy .",
    "this region contains a population of hot and young stars , aged 1060 myr @xcite , and it is believed to display the metallicity characteristics of the smc : z @xmath1 0.004 @xcite .    among the characteristic properties of the smc , its low metallicity and low dust content ( 1/30 that of the milky way ; *",
    "* ) impose intriguing boundary conditions on our current understanding of star formation . with the objective of characterizing star formation in this peculiar environment , we have carried out an extensive hubble space telescope ( hst ) and spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ;",
    "* ) investigation of the stellar content and star formation acivity in a number of young clusters . here",
    ", we present our first results for ngc  602 .",
    "observations of ngc  602 ( ra  = 1:29:31 , dec  = @xmath273:33:15 , j2000 ) were taken in the optical and mid - infrared , with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hst ( proposal 10248 , also including ngc  346 ) and the infrared array camera ( irac ) on spitzer ( program i d 125 ) .    in the optical , the acs wide field channel ( wfc )",
    "was used for observations in three filters : f555w , f814w ( approximately the johnson  v and i  bands ) , and f658n ( h@xmath3 ) . in  plate",
    "[ acsplate ] , we show the fully reduced and multidrizzled f555w , f814w , f658n color composite image of ngc 602 .",
    "the image covers a region of @xmath4 , corresponding to a linear size of 58  pc @xmath5 58  pc at the distance of the smc ( 60.6  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total integration times are 2150s for the f555w image , 2265s for the f814w image , and 1908s for the f658n image , respectively .",
    "all images were reduced using the standard stsci acs pipeline calacs .",
    "photometry was performed on the drizzled images by aperture and point spread function ( psf ) fitting , using the iraf daophot package .",
    "stars were automatically detected with daofind in all frames , with the detection threshold set at 4@xmath6 above the background for the f555w image and at 3.5@xmath6 for the f814w image .",
    "spurious features , such as noise spikes , were rejected .",
    "a spatially variable psf was computed for both the f555w and f814w images , using 110 isolated stars in different positions on the images .",
    "the correction for charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) was applied .",
    "the final photometry was calibrated on the acs vega - magnitude system , normalized to a standard 10  pixel ( 05 ) aperture radius , with zero points adopted from @xcite .    in the infrared ,",
    "we present images from spitzer / irac in the four bands : 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath7 m @xcite . the final three band ( [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 8.0 ] ) composite irac image",
    "is shown in plate  [ iracplate ] .",
    "the data were taken in 30s high dynamic range mode , using five dithers in the medium cycling pattern .",
    "each frame has an exposure time of 26.8s , for a total integration time of 134s in each band .",
    "the total field of view is approximately @xmath8 , corresponding to a linear size of 88  pc @xmath5 88  pc .",
    "the s11.4.0 version of the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) were used for constructing the irac mosaics , using the spitzer mosaicker software in each channel , along with the iracproc package @xcite .",
    "the overlap correction module was used to minimize instrumental offsets between frames , and the mosaics were constructed on a pixel scale of 04/pixel .",
    "the sources were located and photometry extracted from the mosaic using the iraf tasks daofind and phot , using a cutoff of 4@xmath6 to find the sources . a radius of 16 ( 4  mosaic pixels ) was used in the phot task , and zero point corrections were applied to normalize the photometry to the nominal 10  pixel ( @xmath9 ) radius .",
    "the vega magnitude zero points used were 24.804 , 24.116 , 22.058 , and 22.478 for channels 14 , respectively .",
    "the newly acquired hst / acs and spitzer / irac images offer , for the first time , a high resolution view of the ngc  602 field .",
    "the smc wing is a low density region and very transparent , allowing us to view background galaxies with only a red tinge from its meager dust allotment ( see plate  [ acsplate ] ) .",
    "this is the case even when looking through the center of the nebula , indicating that the central column density is insufficient for any extreme reddening in this region .",
    "the morphology of the ngc  602 region is reminiscent of a partial ring .",
    "two ridges of dust and gaseous filaments outline the nebular shape towards the se and to the nw and are highlighted by magnificent elephant trunks .",
    "the primary stellar cluster shines in the middle of the broken ring , about 18  pc from the northwest ridge and about 9  pc from the southeast ridge .",
    "radiation from this concentration of the brightest cluster stars appears to have swept out from the center , creating the inner cavity of the bubble .",
    "many faint stars are visible on , or in close proximity to , the two ridges , indicating that star formation might still be active there .",
    "the ring morphology is also well defined in the spitzer / irac composite image ( plate  [ iracplate ] ) , where the two ridges are the brightest diffuse features detected and contain most of the brightest ir sources identified , correspondint to so - called elephant trunks and dusty pillars .",
    "we use color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) as a primary method of identifying the stellar populations present in the region .",
    "the ( f555w , f555w ",
    "f814w ) cmd of the region is constructed using photometric data with the daophot short exposure photometric error @xmath100.03 and long exposure psf sharpness @xmath11 , thus choosing only point - like features and eliminating from the source list detections of galaxies and fuzzy brightness variations in diffuse emission regions . this optical cmd ( fig .",
    "[ acscmd ] ) shows a very well delineated main sequence ( ms ) down to v  = 26.5 .",
    "the upper part of the ms indicates the presence of a very young population .",
    "the lowest part of the ms has the characteristics of an older population , most likely the background field of the smc wing .",
    "the ms turnoff is outlined , but not very well populated , and there is an indication of a red giant branch and of a red clump at v  = 19.5 , v ",
    "in addition , we detect a sizable population of faint and red stars located to the right of the ms ( v @xmath12 22 , 1 @xmath10 v ",
    "i @xmath10 2 ) .",
    "the magnitude and color of this group of stars is consistent with the nature of low mass ( 0.63  @xmath0 ) pms stars .",
    "isochrone fitting allows us to estimate the ages of these different stellar populations . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ acscmd ] , the bright blue part of the cluster ms is well fit by a @xcite isochrone of 4  myr , z  = 0.004 .",
    "the fainter ms belongs mostly to an older population , dated at @xmath16  gyr , with z  = 0.001 , consistent with the smc field on the edge of the wing near the magellanic bridge @xcite as determined from complementary hst / acs observations of a nearby `` featureless '' region .",
    "isochrone fitting also allows us to conclude that the rich pms population @xcite is coeval with the cluster main sequence with an age of about 4  myr , and these individual low - mass objects have not yet reached the ms . in all cases , we have applied a low e(b ",
    "v )  = 0.08 ( a@xmath13 ) reddening factor to the isochrones , as determined from ground - based observations in b , v , and  i.    the irac data allow us to sample a population of young stellar objects ( ysos ) even younger than the pms population we detect in the optical images . after examining five cmds",
    ", we identify 25 good yso candidates .",
    "objects readily identifiable as background galaxies in the optical images are manually removed from the object list , leaving 51 point - like sources with measurable flux in the three bands [ 3.6 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] .",
    "we use yso models for a range of ages , masses , and viewing angles @xcite to help with the identification of the color - magnitude space in which we expect to find ysos .",
    "the ( [ 8.0 ] , [ 3.6][8.0 ] ) irac cmd is representative and is shown in fig .",
    "[ iraccmd ] .",
    "young stellar object ( yso ) models span an evolutionary range from class 0 ( @xmath110@xmath14  yr ) to class  ii ( @xmath15@xmath16  yr ) .",
    "class  0 ysos are in the early protostellar collapse phase , with t  @xmath1 30k .",
    "class  i sources are at a later stage of protostellar collapse which lasts @xmath110@xmath17  yr .",
    "class  ii sources are characterized by the presence of excess infrared emission above a stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "our yso candidates fall in the same color - magnitude space as class  0.5 and class  i yso models , indicating that we are finding recent , possibly still ongoing , star formation which began about 1  myr ago .",
    "the low - mass pms population that we see in the hst / acs data corresponds to more evolved , likely class  ii objects .",
    "however , these objects have very low masses ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) and magnitudes which fall below our spitzer / irac detection limit .",
    "fig .  [ marked ] shows the spatial distribution of pms stars ( green dots ) as detected in the optical images and ysos ( white circles ; also shown on plate  [ iracplate ] ) selected from the ir dataset .",
    "the pre - main sequence population is concentrated in the center of the cluster , where the brightest and most massive stars , those with spectral types  o and  b @xcite , are also found . to the east , to the north , and along the se ridge , we see a number of compact knots of faint red stars in regions veiled by dust . outside the central cluster ,",
    "pms stars appear generally concentrated in compact , structured groups , similar to the sub - clusters detected in the young smc region ngc  346 @xcite .",
    "farther from the cluster center , outside the main nebular structure , the stellar population becomes dominated by the smc field , and the spatial density of pms stars drops considerably .",
    "for example , the bright sub - cluster located due north of the central cluster , near the top edge of the field of view , displays a population composed exclusively of ms and red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "the ysos , as detected in the irac observations , have a different spatial distribution than the pms population .",
    "overall , the ysos are farther from the cluster center .",
    "this agrees with expectations , since the winds and radiation from the most massive stars appear to have effectively removed dust and gas from this inner region . instead ,",
    "ysos mostly appear concentrated along the nw and se dusty ridges , indicating that star formation is more recent and is likely still active and progressing within these two structures , forming dusty pilars remeniscent of those seen in other known star - forming regions .",
    "we have shown that the combination of recently acquired deep optical hst / acs images and ir spitzer / irac images of ngc  602 suggests an intriguing chronological sequence of star forming events in this young cluster .",
    "the high resolution optical data show a rich population of low mass ( 0.63  @xmath0 ) pms stars that formed coevally with the central cluster about 4  myr ago .",
    "conversely , the brightest sources detected in the ir images have magnitudes and colors consistent with state - of - the - art model ysos of class  0.5 and class  i. these objects have typical lifetimes of @xmath20@xmath21  yr , indicating that the region is likely experiencing ongoing episodes of star formation .",
    "the youngest objects are far from the central cluster and are concentrated along the two dusty ridges .",
    "the crossing time from the cluster center to the these ridges is between  1 and 2  myr , and it is very plausible that the most recent star formation is triggered by instabilities caused by the earlier formation of the central cluster .",
    "it is also likely that star formation is actively continuing in the region of the ridges , where gas and dust are still abundant .",
    "further work is necessary to fully characterize the star formation in this region .",
    "this includes spectroscopic characterization of the pms stars and ysos , classification of individual yso s by fitting spectral energy distributions to models , and spectroscopic observations of the gas kinematics .",
    "we wish to thank lars christensen ( esa ) and zolt levay and lisa frattare ( stsci ) for producing the beautiful color composite image of ngc  602 presented in plate  [ acsplate ] .",
    "hst funding came from stsci go grant go-10248.07-a .",
    "this work is also based in part on observations ( program 125 , request key 12485120 ) made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under nasa contract 1407 .",
