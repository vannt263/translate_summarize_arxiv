    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at radio frequencies is an observing technique that provides images with very high angular resolution ( of order 1 mas at @xmath5 @xmath6 10 ghz ) and very accurate astrometric registration relative to distant quasars ( typically better than 0.1 mas , even in moderate signal - to - noise situations ; e.g.  reid & honma 2014 ) . an interesting application of these characteristics is the direct determination of distances through the accurate measurement of trigonometric parallaxes using multi - epoch vlbi observations .",
    "magnetically active young stellar objects ( ysos ) have been a target of choice because they are associated with bright and compact radio sources that can easily be detected in vlbi observations ( e.g.  loinard et al .",

    "dzib et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; ortiz - len et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "vlbi observations are particularly appropriate for the case of young stars ( e.g. , loinard et al .",
    "2011 ; brunthaler et al .",
    "2011 ) because they are often highly embedded inside of their parental cloud , and therefore highly obscured . as a consequence , optical and near - ir telescopes ( including the gaia astrometry mission )",
    "are at a disadvantage for this type of sources . in this paper",
    ", we will present multi - epoch vlbi observations of a suspected cluster of magnetically active low - mass ysos in the monoceros r2 high - mass star - forming region .",
    "the monoceros r2 region was initially identified as a chain of reflection nebulae illuminated by a and b  type stars ( gyulbudaghian et al .",
    "1978 and references therein ) and named ggd 11 to 17 .",
    "those nebulae are associated with a giant molecular cloud that harbors numerous other signposts of active massive star - formation ( water masers , bright infrared sources , etc . ) . indeed ,",
    "one of the first molecular outflows ever reported ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1982 ) is located in the ggd 1215 sub - region of monoceros . in this very same region ,",
    "gmez et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) discovered a cluster of nine compact radio sources surrounding a cometary ultra compact  region ( ) , and distributed over an area of less than 400 arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the  region was named vla  1 and the compact sources vla  2 to vla  10 .",
    "gmez et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) argued that most of these compact radio sources are associated with magnetically active low - mass ysos because of their variability and spectral indices .",
    "as a consequence , they are good candidates for vlbi observations .    obtaining an accurate distance to monoceros",
    "is of high importance since it is , after orion at 414@xmath87 pc ( menten et al .",
    "2007 ) and cepheus a at 700@xmath830 pc ( moscadelli et al .  2009 ; dzib et al .  2011 ) , one of the nearest regions where high - mass star formation is occurring .",
    "distances to monoceros r2 have been estimated mainly using spectroscopic and photometric studies .",
    "the first measurements are from racine ( 1968 ) , who estimated a distance of 830@xmath850 pc ; and rozhkovski & kurchakov  ( 1968 ) who found a distance of 700 pc ( see also downes et al .  1975 ) .",
    "later on , racine & van der bergh ( 1970 ) , in a proceeding conference , gave a revised distance of 950 pc , without further details .",
    "in the most recent paper using that technique , herbst & racine ( 1976 ) reported 830@xmath850 pc ; this last value is the most commonly adopted distance to monoceros r2 in the astronomical literature ( carpenter & hodapp 2008 ) . on the other hand , rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1980 ) use co line observations to derive a kinematic distance of 1 kpc , which is another commonly used distance for monoceros r2 .",
    "finally , reid et al . (",
    "2016 ) have made available a bayesian distance calculator that improves the determination of the kinematic distances to sources in the galactic spiral arms . by using this tool and a @xmath9 = + 11 @xmath2 1 km s@xmath10 for ggd 1215 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1980 ) we obtained two possible distances .",
    "the most likely distance , with a probability density of 17 kpc@xmath10 , is 760@xmath11 pc that is in agreement with the distance obtained by herbst & racine ( 1976 ) .",
    "the second possible distance , with a probability density of just 5 kpc@xmath10 , is around 420 pc .",
    "we observed the 10 vla sources from gmez et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) using the vlbi technique .",
    "specifically , the observations were collected using the very long baseline array ( vlba ; napier et al .",
    "1994 ) operated in combination with the 100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ; prestage et al .",
    "2009 ) at a wavelength of 3.6  cm ( @xmath5 = 8.42 ghz ) .",
    "a total of 17 observations were performed ( see table [ tab : rpfi ] ) .",
    "we first undertook a pilot study ( bl169 ) which consisted of three epochs , in which we detected three sources . following the successful detection of three of the target sources",
    ", we initiated a series of multi - epoch observations starting in september 2010 , as part of the project bl176 .",
    "the observations , including the pilot epochs , were accommodated close to the equinoxes when the maximum elongation of the parallactic ellipse occurs ( specifically for monoceros , the maximum elongation occurs on march and september 24 of each year ) . during each equinox",
    "a maximum of three observations were scheduled separated from one another by a few days to a few weeks .",
    "as the sources are highly variable , this observing mode increases the probability of obtaining at least one detection during each equinox .",
    "the last observation was collected in october 2012 .",
    "the spectral setups were different for projects bl169 and bl176 . in the former , four base - band channels ( bbcs ) were observed .",
    "each bbcs contained 128 channels of 0.125 mhz each .",
    "this setup was chosen to enable the mapping of the entire area containing our 10 targets without significant bandwidth smearing loss .",
    "the bl176 observations , on the other hand , used only 16 channels of 1  mhz each , but took advantage of the ( then , newly available ) multi - phase center capability provided by the vlba difx digital correlator ( deller et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this observing mode ,",
    "a different phase center was positioned at the location of each one of our 10 targets , generating 10 separate and smaller visibility datasets .",
    "the main phase calibrator for all epochs was j06060724 , located at an angular distance of 1.6 degrees from the targets . to improve the quality of phase calibration",
    ", we also observed the secondary calibrators j06070834 , j06160306 and j06060024 , which are distributed around our target sources as shown in figure [ fig : calpos ] .",
    "additionally , about two dozen icrf quasars spread over the entire visible sky were observed periodically during the observations ( conforming so - called _ geodetic blocks _ ) ; those are used to improve tropospheric calibration ( e.g. , reid & brunthaler 2004 ) .",
    "the observations obtained as part of project bl169 had a total duration of five hours while those corresponding to project bl176 had a duration of nine hours .",
    "each individual observation contained three 30-minute geodetic blocks , scheduled at the beginning , the middle , and the end of each observation .",
    "the observations of the targets were recorded as part of cycles with two minutes spent on - source , and one minute spent on the main phase calibrator .",
    "roughly every 30 minutes , we also observed the secondary calibrators , spending one minute on each one .",
    "two of the observations were affected by logistical issues and were excluded from our analysis : epoch bl176l was a total loss , with no usable data recorded , while epoch bl176h was affected by a mistake during correlation which led to no dataset being produced for the target phase centers .",
    "additionally , in the epoch bl176f the setup used to observe the icrf quasars was erroneously kept until half - way through the observations , meaning the first half of the target data was unusable .",
    "this limited the observing time , and explains the higher noise level recorder in that observation ( table [ tab : rpfi ] ) . in epoch",
    "bl176 m the tsys information for the gbt antenna was not generated , and it was artificially created a posteriori using the tsys information from the epoch bl176c that was taken almost on the same date but two years before . in this case",
    "we down - weighted the visibilities containing gbt data to minimize the impact of the resulting poorer amplitude calibration .",
    "we note that the calibrator data are self - calibrated in amplitude as part of the data processing .",
    "this helped to mitigate the lack of tsys measurements for the gbt .",
    "finally for epochs bl176d and bl176e the field related to source vla 9 was not correlated .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; greisen 2003 ) .",
    "the basic data reduction followed the standard vlba procedure for phase - referenced observations , including the multi - calibrator schemes and the tropospheric and clock corrections obtained from the geodetic blocks .",
    "these calibrations were described in detail by loinard et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , torres et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and dzib et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . after calibration",
    ", the visibilities were first imaged with a pixel size of 50 @xmath12as using a natural weighting scheme plane .",
    "this leads to the best possible noise level , but since the central portion of the @xmath13 plane tends to be more densely populated than the outer parts , natural weighting produces the lowest possible angular resolution .",
    "robust = @xmath145 ( uniform weighting ) , on the other , produces a uniform weighting of the visibilities across the @xmath13 plane .",
    "this results in the highest possible resolution , but worst possible noise level .",
    "intermediate values ( in aips , robust varies continuously between the @xmath2 5 extrema ) correspond to intermediate weighting schemes between natural and uniform . in many cases , robust values around zero",
    "provide a good compromise yielding a substantial gain in resolution over natural weighting , at the cost of only a minor loss in sensitivity . ]",
    "( robust = 5 in aips ) . as this scheme provides the best possible noise levels , we used these images to search for source detections . when a detection was obtained , we constructed new images with a weighting scheme intermediate between natural and uniform ( robust = 0 or robust = 2 , depending on the intensity of the detection ) .",
    "this enabled a slighty better determination of the source positions at each epoch .",

    "the source position , when detected , was determined by using a two - dimensional fitting procedure ( task jmfit in aips ) .",

    "a total of four distinct sources were detected in our observations . a source associated with vla  1",

    "in addition , the sources appear to be highly variable : the vlba source associated with vla  1 shows variations by a factor of nearly 5 , while the sources associated with vla  3 , 8 , and 10 should have been detected at most epochs if their fluxes remained steady .",
    "the fact that they were not suggests that they go through occasional flaring activity when their flux increases at least by a factor of several .",
    "this combination of high brightness temperature and high variability strongly suggests that the detected sources are flaring low - mass stars with coronal emission .",

    ".    the situation can be very significantly improved if the proper motion is allowed to be ( uniformly ) accelerated .",
    "the best fit , in this case ( figure [ fig : pi ] , bottom ) yields :    @xmath57    from the comparison with the non - accelerated case , it can be seen that the situation in declination remains nearly unchanged , with an acceleration component in that direction consistent with 0 within 2.5@xmath52 . in right ascension , however , the fit is significantly improved , with an acceleration component detected at nearly 9@xmath52 and an improvement on the final parallax accuracy by a factor of 3 .",
    "this improvement also results in the fact that to obtain a reduced @xmath56 of 1 , no systematic errors at all had to be added to those delivered by jmfit in declination .",
    "in right ascension , only 0.09 mas had to be added ( compared with 0.33 mas when no acceleration is allowed ) .",
    "note that the best - fit value of the parallax remains , nevertheless , fully consistent with the non - accelerated case .",
    "the existence of acceleration in the proper motion of vla  1@xmath0 suggests that it belongs to a multiple system .",
    "the acceleration vector does not appear to point toward any of the known sources associated with vla  1 .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the acceleration appears to be fairly substantial ( nearly 1 mas yr@xmath58 , compared with a proper motion of about 5 mas yr@xmath10 along that same direction ) so the companion must be very nearby .",
    "we are most likely dealing with a very compact binary stellar system .",
    "since the acceleration can be approximated with a constant value over the interval of 2.5 years spanned by the observations , we can conservatively conclude that the period of the binary must be significantly longer that 2.5 years ( e.g. , see figure [ fig : psky ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the binary system is formed by two stars each with one solar mass and that the orbit is circular and face - on , we will get the largest acceleration possible in the plane of the sky .",
    "this gives an upper limit to the separation for the components of the binary of 6.5 au . in turn",
    ", this gives an upper limit to the period of 12.2 years .",
    "we conclude that our results are consistent with a binary system with these parameters .",
    "since acceleration is not constant along a keplerian orbit , future observations ought to be inconsistent with our constant acceleration assumption .",
    "in particular , observations obtained in the next few years should , if fitted independently of the data presented here , yield a different acceleration vector .",

    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the previous measurements were indirect and , therefore , prone to possible systematic errors related with uncertain assumptions regarding the nature of the observed star , the properties of the interstellar medium , or the appropriate galactic rotation curve . our measurement , on the other hand , is purely geometric .",

    "it has been suggested that monoceros and orion might be linked by an expanding super - bubble that may have triggered star - formation in both regions ( heiles 1998 ) . from the distance to monoceros reported above and its measured proper motion and radial velocity ( @xmath9 = + 11 @xmath2 1 km s@xmath10 ; see rodrguez et al .",
    "1980 ) , one can derive the location @xmath60 and velocity vector @xmath61 of monoceros in the milky way , and examine this issue from a kinematic point of view .",
    "we will express the positions and velocities in the commonly used rectangular reference frame centered on the location of the sun , with the @xmath62 axis pointing toward the galactic center , the @xmath63 axis perpendicular to @xmath62 and pointing in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath64 pointing toward the galactic north pole ( gnp ) so as to make @xmath65 right - handed .",
    "in these coordinates , the position of monoceros appears to be @xmath60 = @xmath66 pc : it is located almost exactly toward the galactic anticenter , but nearly 300 pc below the galactic mid - plane . for reference , in the same system , orion is located at @xmath67 pc , nearly the same direction but at less than half the distance .",
    "the velocity vector of monoceros deduced from our observations , and expressed in the same rectangular frame relative to the lsr is @xmath61 = @xmath68 km s@xmath10 with formal uncertainties of order 2 km s@xmath10 along each direction .",
    "we note , however , that since this value is based on a single proper motion measurement , it could contain a significant systematic error if vla  1@xmath0 happens to have a significant peculiar velocity relative to the rest of the monoceros r2 cluster . in the same system ,",
    "the velocity of orion is @xmath61 = @xmath69 km s@xmath10 .",
    "thus , there does not appear to be an obvious relation between the relative velocities of the two regions .",
    "this does not discard a common origin , however , as dynamical evolution of expanding bubbles can be complex . as a final note , we would like to point out that while monoceros is not normally associated with gould s belt ( e.g.  pppell 1997 ) , it does appear to be projected almost exactly along the plane defining gould s belt ( figure [ fig : gb_xz ] ) .",
    "its velocity vector is also almost entirely contained within the plane defining gould s belt , and oriented mostly away from gould s belt center , as would be expected if it participated in the overall expansion of that structure .",
    "our detection of a very compact non - thermal radio source close to peak position of the  region vla  1 ( gmez et al .",

    "2000 ) . the proper motion of vla  1@xmath0 over the 15 years separating the observations reported by gmez et al .  ( 2000 ) and our vlba observations is expected to have been only @xmath70 , also insufficient to explain the separation between vla  1@xmath0 and the compact source reported by them . in addition , while the brightness temperature of the compact source detected by gmez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is @xmath6200 k , that of vla  1@xmath0 is larger than 10@xmath53 k. this further confirms that the two sources have a different nature .",
    "compact radio sources have been founded toward other  regions : ngc 6334a ( carral et al .  2002 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "2014 ) , ngc 6334e ( carral et al .",
    "2002 ) , and w3(oh ) ( dzib et al .  2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "the source detected in w3(oh ) is also thermal in nature , but those detected in ngc 6334a and ngc 6334e have been suggested to be non - thermal sources ( carral et al .",
    "2002 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , this is the first time that a compact source projected toward an  region is imaged with the vlbi technique .",
    "massive stars are expected to be fully radiative .",
    "thus , they are not expected to produce magnetically active coronas . on the other hand",
    "they can produce non - thermal radio emission in the strong shocks produced by the interaction of their jets with the surrounding medium ( e.g. , carrasco - gonzlez et al .",
    "2010 ) and in the wind - wind collision regions of two massive stars ( e.g. , ortiz - len et al .",
    "the only well documented cases of jet - medium shocks show that they produce emission that is extended to sizes of around @xmath71 level ( e.g. , carrasco - gonzlez et al .",
    "2010 ; wilner et al .",
    "1999 ) , that will be resolved out in vlbi observations .",
    "on the other hand , wind - wind collision regions have been imaged with vlbi and appear as resolved bow shock structures ( dougherty et al .",
    "2005 ; ortiz - len et al .",
    "2011 ) . at the distance of monoceros",
    "such structures should be resolved if present , but this is not the case of the source reported here that shows , instead , a very compact structure in the seven detected epochs .",
    "the brightness temperature , size and variability of vla  1@xmath0 is similar to those detected for magnetically active intermediate- and low - mass ysos ( e.g. , loinard et al .",
    "2008 , dzib et al .",
    "2010 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we suggest that this source is a magnetically active star ( this explains , a posteriori , our choice of name , vla  1@xmath0 , for this source ) . with the data presented here",
    ", we can not constrain the properties of vla  1@xmath0 further . in particular , it is unclear whether vla  1@xmath0 is physically associated with the  region vla  1 , or if it is located behind or in front of it .",
    "also , the mass of the star associated with vla  1@xmath0 remains entirely unconstrained , as are the properties of the putative multiple system to which it belongs .",
    "most of the radio compact sources in ggd 12 - 15 were associated with magnetically active t tauri stars by gmez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , due to their variability and spectral indices .",
    "the only exception was vla  7 whose steady flux density and positive spectral index suggested a thermal radio emission produced by stellar winds . with the new radio observations ,",
    "the non - thermal nature is confirmed for vla 3 , vla 8 , and vla 10 .    adopting 5@xmath52 upper limits ,",
    "the remaining five sources were not detected at levels of 90 @xmath12jy .",
    "this flux level is comparable to ( or , in some cases , significantly lower than ) the flux density reported by gmez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for these sources .",
    "an explanation is that their flux levels during all the observations were lower than our threshold detection limit .",
    "this is feasible , since also the flux density of vla 3 , vla 8 and vla 10 are below our threshold limit in almost all the epochs .",
    "another explanation is that they are resolved out in our high resolution images . as a rough attempt",
    "to detect extended non - thermal radio emission from these sources , we produced images by only using the shortest baselines in the array ( @xmath7280,000 k@xmath73 ) .",
    "no detection was obtained .",
    "finally , we should mention that our observations at 8.4 ghz are not ideal for these sources , given their negative spectral indices .",
    "new vlbi observations at longer wavelengths would help to clarify the nature of their radio emission .",
    "this would be possible using the new sensitive c - band ( 6 ghz ) receivers installed on the vlba antennas .",
    "in this paper , we reported on vlba observations of the cluster of compact radio sources associated with the  region in ggd 12 - 15 , also known as vla  1 , reported by gmez et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "we detected a total of four sources .",
    "the sources vla  3 , vla  8 , and vla  10 were detected only in single epochs , while a source projected inside vla  1 was detected in seven different epochs .",
    "given its radio properties , this source is likely to be a magnetically active star , that we call vla  1@xmath0 . using the measured positions of vla  1@xmath0 in the seven detected epochs , we derive its proper motion and trigonometric parallax , @xmath1 . the best fit yields @xmath1 = 1.12@xmath80.05 mas , that corresponds to a distance @xmath3 = 893@xmath59 pc .",
