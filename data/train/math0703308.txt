    "in particular , a constructive proof of a formula due to stembridge is deduced .      in 1988 , i.  g.  macdonald  @xcite introduced a remarkable new basis for the space of symmetric functions .",
    "the elements of this basis are denoted @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a partition , @xmath9 is a vector of indeterminates , and @xmath3 are parameters .",
