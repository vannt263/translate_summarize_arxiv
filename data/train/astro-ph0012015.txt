    "this is the tenth paper of a series whose purpose is to obtain cepheid distances to galaxies that have produced supernovae of type ia ( sne  ia ) , thereby calibrating their absolute magnitudes at maximum light .      from the tightness of the hubble diagram",
    ", it was recognized early on that many type i supernovae have nearly the same absolute magnitude at maximum , and that they would be useful in obtaining distances to galaxies that produced them . if true , supernovae could play a major role in the calibration of the extra - galactic distance scale ( @xcite ) , leading to the hubble constant quite directly .",
    "the only intermediate step required would `` simply '' be to calibrate their mean absolute magnitude at maximum if that mean was strictly a constant , or to devise means to determine the second - parameter corrections if there is a range in absolute magnitude ( i.e. a significant diversity ) .",
    "the evidence for the spectral homogeneity of a subclass of supernovae eventually called type i was progressively discovered .",
    "the evidence began with the exhaustive discussion of the spectra of sn  1937c in ic  4182 , and sn  1937d in ngc  1003 by @xcite .",
    "his further discussion of supernovae spectra showed differences from the prototype spectra he had studied in 1939 . as a result",
    ", he introduced the type i and type ii classification that became standard ( @xcite ) .",
    "more subtle differences in the spectra , even within the type i class , began to be recognized in 1964 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite had noticed the lack of certain spectral features ( no @xmath8  absorption and no p  cygni profiles ) in a few sne  i , contrary to most of the class , but no further action was taken at that time .",
    "however , by 1985 the variations discovered by bertola were shown to be general , and the sne  ia class was divided into the sub - types ia and ib ( @xcite ) .",
    "the class was formally named by @xcite , and formally defined by @xcite .",
    "diversity was soon again noticed even in the new ib class .",
    "harkness et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) and @xcite showed that the type ib should again be divided into two separate groups on the basis of spectra .",
    "they introduced the new class of ic .",
    "the stability ( constancy ) of the mean absolute magnitude of the classical sn  ia type was also being questioned .",
    "progressive improvements in the photometry of sne since the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite had shown the remarkable similarity of the shape of the light curves of sne  ia . however , by 1973 it began to be noticed that small systematic differences in fact do exist in the details of the light curves , in particular , in their decay rates after maximum light .",
    "@xcite gave an important summary , following earlier indications of a decay - rate absolute magnitude correlation by pskovskii ( 1967 , 1971 , 1984 ) .",
    "there were also indications that the expansion velocities of the sne  ia are not all the same and that the differences are correlated with absolute magnitude and decay - rate ( branch 1981 , 1982 ) .",
    "however , at the same time as spectral diversities were being found that required division of the minkowski broad class i into three groups , improvements in the photometry and the discovery of many more sne  ia at relatively large redshifts ( @xmath9 ) permitted major improvements in the formulation of the hubble diagram ( redshift vs. apparent magnitude at maximum ) of sne  ia .",
    "the distribution of magnitude residuals about the linear regression of @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 for a linear velocity - distance relation of course immediately gives the rms scatter of the mean absolute magnitude , @xmath12 .",
    "this hubble diagram scatter became progressively smaller as the photometry improved ( sandage & tammann 1982 , 1993 , 1997 ) , showing that any systematic deviation in @xmath12 must be smaller than @xmath13 mag for branch normal ( @xcite ) sne  ia , to which the samples that defined the cited hubble diagrams had been restricted .",
    "a history of this early work and the pros and cons of believing that @xmath12 was remarkably stable is given by branch & tammann ( 1992 ) , again when the samples are restricted to branch normal sne  ia .",
    "it was because of this remarkable apparent constancy of @xmath12 for samples so restricted that we also restricted the absolute magnitude calibrations in the first nine papers of this series to such sne  ia subtypes .",
    "it is now known , primarily from the extensive new precise photometry by the supernova group at cerro - tololo lead by phillips , that when the restriction on the spectral normalcy is removed , an appreciable range of @xmath12 is present .",
    "it is also now known that a small range in @xmath14 exists even among the restricted branch normal sne  ia .",
    "the range depends both on decay rate and color [ @xcite , @xcite ( paper  ix ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] confirming the decay - rate part of the correlation suggested by pskovskii ( 1967 , 1971 , 1984 ) and by @xcite .",
    "the early paper by @xcite began the modern discussions of the decay - rate absolute magnitude relation .",
    "tammann & sandage ( 1995 ) , saha et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , parodi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and sandage , tammann , & saha ( 2000 ) have argued that the steep slope in their initial formulation was overestimated . the magnitude of this dependence is now accepted to be milder ( @xcite ) than in their initial formulation .    a more complete review of the many discovery paths from homogeneity to diversity from kowal to the present , and the amplitude of each second parameter as it is currently understood , or is now or has been controversial , is discussed by sandage , tammann , & saha ( 2000 ) .",
    "a new development was begun with the discovery of a different kind of spectral abnormality in the supernova 1991 t that was discovered on april 13 , 1991 in ngc  4527 .",
    "the discovery was made 15 days before maximum light that occurred on april 28 .",
    "a detailed summary of the many discoveries and discussions by many different groups of the spectral diversity shown by sn  1991 t is given in the introduction in the paper by @xcite .",
    "briefly , @xcite obtained spectra from 12 days before maximum to 47 days after maximum ( hereafter @xmath15 to @xmath16d ) showing that the pre - maximum spectra `` did not resemble those of any other supernova [ but ] beginning near maximum light the usual sne  ia lines of intermediate - mass elements slowly developed , and months after the explosion the iron - dominated spectrum appeared almost identical to that of a typical sn  ia '' ( fisher et al .",
    "the same description of the abnormal spectra before maximum ( @xmath17 to @xmath18d ) was given by @xcite , and by @xcite for before and after maximum light ( @xmath17 to @xmath19d ) .",
    "all independent data showed that the spectrum was not branch normal before maximum light but resembled almost identically branch normal prototypes after maximum light .",
    "was the absolute magnitude at maximum light also peculiar ?",
    "a large literature has developed based on the premise that sn  1991 t was very much brighter than the usual branch normal sne  ia that all have @xmath20 in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 with an rms dispersion of only 0.2 mag ( saha et al . 1999 , table  5 and equations 10 and 11 ) .",
    "a number of special ( non - standard ) supernova explosion models have been discussed , some using absolute magnitudes as bright as @xmath23 ( e.g. fisher et al .",
    "1999 ) , fully 0.7 mag brighter than the present canonical branch normal mean absolute magnitude ( see the 1999 stsci workshop on sn and gamma ray bursts cited as livio , panagia & sahu 2000 in the references ) .",
    "however we share the opinion of many of the authors we have cited that the evidence for such bright absolute magnitude rests on quite insecure grounds for at least some of the estimates of @xmath24 in the literature . even before obtaining the cepheid data presented in this paper ,",
    "our opinion of a few of the methods used to obtain these bright estimates has led us to question whether @xmath24 was any more abnormal than @xmath7 mag from @xmath25 , and , therefore , whether it deviates at all from the shallow decay - rate vs. absolute magnitude relation that we derived in paper  ix of this series ( saha et al .",
    "1999 , fig .",
    "fisher et al . ( 1999 , their section 5 ) gives a good summary of some of the evidence used by others to infer an abnormally bright absolute magnitude for sn  1991 t .",
    "most unfortunately the problem lies almost entirely with the value of the extinction suffered by sn  1991 t itself .",
    "the different estimates of the extinction by different authors , plus a variety of assumptions on the distance of ngc  4527 relative either to the bulk of the main virgo cluster spirals or to a proposed membership in the tight x group of @xcite , which is the group named 11 - 4 by @xcite containing ngc  4496a , ngc  4536 , and ngc  4725 , also complicated the early estimates .",
    "one can obtain conclusions that range from the result that @xmath26 of sn1991 t is normal compared with branch - normal sne  ia ( phillips et al .",
    "1992 in an early paper ) , to those where the absolute magnitude of sn  1991 t is at least 0.6 mag brighter than the mean of normal sne  ia ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992 ) , or that @xmath27 is 0.75 mag brighter than sn  1981b in ngc  4536 ( fisher et al .",
    "1999 , their table  1 ) .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to obtain the absorption corrected distance to the parent galaxy ngc  4527 , thereby circumventing all assumptions of relative distances by group associations to other galaxies for which cepheid distances are also available .",
    "although we are confident that our absorption corrected cepheid modulus of ngc  4527 is systematically correct to within the external uncertainties quoted in sections 4 and 5 , the conclusion of @xmath26 for sn  1991 t still depends on the uncertain assumptions we make concerning its absorption .",
    "we discuss all the possibilities based on the various assumptions concerning the absorption .",
    "repeated images of a field in ngc  4527 were obtained using the wfpc2 ( @xcite ) on the @xmath28 .",
    "the field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , marked over a ground based image of ngc  4527 .",
    "the composite image of this field taken with the wfpc2 is shown in fig .",
    "there are 12 discrete epochs in the @xmath0 passband , and 5 epochs in the @xmath1 passband , spanning a period of 69 days .",
    "the duration of this period is constrained by the time - window during which this target can be observed with @xmath28 without altering the field orientation .",
    "the epochs were spaced strategically over this period to provide maximum leverage on detecting and finding periods of cepheid variables over the period range 10 to 65 days .",
    "each epoch in each filter was made of two sub - exposures taken back - to - back on successive orbits of the spacecraft .",
    "this allows the removal of cosmic rays by an anti - coincidence technique described by @xcite ( paper v ) .",
    "the images from various epochs are in common alignment to within 34 pixels on the scale of the pc chip , which is 12 pixels on the scale of the other three wide - field chips .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the details of processing the images , combining the sub - exposures for each epoch while removing cosmic rays and performing the photometry with a variant of dophot ( @xcite ) optimized for wfpc2 data has been given in paper v , and are not repeated here .",
    "the reduction procedure for the data is identical to that described in paper  v , with the one exception of a change in the definition of the `` partial aperture '' which is discussed in saha et al .",
    "( 1999 , paper  ix ) .    in keeping with the precepts in paper  v , the measurements in any one passband are expressed in the magnitude system defined by @xcite that is native to the wfpc2 .",
    "these are the @xmath0 and @xmath1 `` ground system '' magnitudes calibrated with @xmath28 `` short '' exposure frames .",
    "the issue of the discrepancy of the photometric zero - points for the `` long '' and `` short '' wfpc2 exposures , originally found by @xcite is described in some detail in paper  v. this phenomenon is attributed to charge transfer problems in the wfpc2 ccds , which is at its worst when the background level in the image is near zero . with increasing background levels , the problem is less present .",
    "thus `` short '' exposures of standard stars / fields which have near zero background yield photometry that is systematically different from `` long '' exposures that have higher levels of background . in previous papers of the series ( except for ic  4182 and",
    "ngc  5253 , which were done with wf / pc , not wfpc2 ) we _ added _",
    "@xmath29 in _ both _ passbands to the @xcite calibration whenever the exposures are longer than several hundred seconds , and ( consequently ) the background level in electrons has been relatively high .",
    "improved characterization of this problem as a function of background level and other parameters for the photometric procedures used in this series of papers is now available , and given in @xcite .",
    "however , the last word on this topic has perhaps not been said , particularly concerning secular trends due to continuing radiation damage of the ccds .",
    "we opt to follow the procedure in previous papers of nominally adding @xmath29 at the final stage of the reductions , while ( as before ) presenting the light curves in the _ uncorrected _ system . in an eventual accounting , all the results can be treated at par , and corrected by a common prescription .",
    "a parallel analysis was done independently at basel , which is described fully in  5 .",
    "as part of this analysis , photometry on the ngc  4527 images was performed independently using the romafot package .",
    "the discussion of the basel procedures , and the comparison with dophot based analysis done in tucson is postponed to  5 .",
    "armed with measured magnitudes and their reported errors at all available epochs for each star in the object list , the method described by @xcite was used to identify variable stars .",
    "the details specific to wfpc2 data have been given in various degrees of detail in papers  v , vi , and viii .",
    "again , parallel efforts were made by the tucson and basel groups , and the results for identified cepheids were merged .",
    "more than 90% of the cepheid candidates found by dophot were also found by romafot .",
    "all variable stars definitely identified are marked in fig .",
    "however , some of the identified variables can not be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] because of their extreme faintness and/or because of the large variation in surface brightness over the field . hence , to complement these charts",
    ", we set out in table  [ tbl2 ] the x and y pixel positions for these objects as they appear in the images identified in the @xmath28 data archive as u42g0101r and u42g0102r .",
    "the photometry on the @xcite `` short exposure '' calibration system for the final list of 66 variable stars is presented in table  [ tbl3 ] for each epoch and each filter .",
    "the periods were determined with the @xcite by using only the @xmath0 passband data .",
    "aliasing is not a serious problem for periods between 10 and 65 days because the observing strategy incorporated an optimum timing scheme as before in this series .    the resulting light curves in the @xmath0 passband , together with periods and mean magnitudes [ determined by integrating the light curves , converted to intensities , and then converting the average back to magnitudes , and called the `` phase - weighted intensity average '' in @xcite ] , are shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] , plotted in the order of descending period .",
    "most of the variable stars identified in this manner can be immediately recognized by their periods and light curves as cepheids .",
    "in fact , none of the 66 objects are _ a priori _ inconsistent with being cepheids , though there is a range in the quality of the light curves .",
    "the objects c3-v5 and c3-v7 are borderline detections , and their amplitudes , if real , are extremely small .",
    "c3-v13 and c4-c23 also have very low amplitudes , but are more convincing as variables . c1-v1 and c2-v6 have periods larger than the 69 day observing baseline , and so their period determinations can not be very reliable . the best estimate for the periods of these stars",
    "is made from the existing data from a subjective assessment of the implied light curve based on an assumed period .",
    "the available data for the variables in @xmath1 were folded with the ephemerides derived above using the @xmath0 data .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "note , however , that four of the variables discovered from the @xmath0 photometry were not found by our procedure in the @xmath1 images ( c1-v12 , c2-v4 , c4-v7 and c4-v11 ) .",
    "this is because either they are intrinsically faint or else appear faint due to high extinction and may not register clearly on the @xmath1 frames which do not reach as faint a limiting magnitude as those in @xmath0 . since photometry of such objects was obviously impossible in @xmath1 , they are dropped from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and also from further analysis .",
    "the mean magnitudes in @xmath1 ( integrated as intensities over the cycle ) were obtained from the procedure of @xcite whereby each @xmath1 magnitude at a randomly sampled phase is converted to a mean value @xmath30 using amplitude and phase information from the more complete @xmath0 light curves .",
    "note that each available observation of @xmath1 can be used independently to derive a mean magnitude .",
    "hence , the scatter of the individual values about the adopted mean @xmath1 value is an _ external _ measure of the uncertainty in determining @xmath30 .",
    "it is this external measure of the uncertainty that is retained and propagated in the later calculations .",
    "there is one instance ( c1-v9 ) where there is only one available @xmath1 measurement , so only the error estimated by dophot for that observation can be propagated : in this instance the error estimate is very high anyway , and the object plays essentially no role in the final distance estimate .",
    "the prescription given in paper  v for assigning the light - curve quality index @xmath31 ( that ranges from 0 to 6 ) was used . in this scheme ,",
    "two points ( @xmath32 ) are given for the quality of the @xmath0 light curves , two points ( @xmath33 ) for the evenness in phase coverage of the five @xmath1 observation epochs , and three points ( @xmath34 ) for the amplitude and phase coherence of the @xmath1 observations compared with the @xmath0 light curve .",
    "hence , a quality index of 6 indicates the best possible light curve quality .",
    "a quality index of 2 or less indicates near fatal flaws such as apparent phase incoherence in the two passbands .",
    "this is generally the indication that object confusion by crowding and/or contamination by background is likely .",
    "table  [ tbl4 ] lists the characteristics of all 66 objects whose light curves in @xmath0 are consistent with those of cepheids . for 62 of these",
    ", an @xmath1 measurement exists for at least one epoch .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 instrumental magnitudes of table  [ tbl3 ] have been converted to the johnson @xmath22 and cousins ( cape ) @xmath35 standard photometric system by the color equations used in previous papers of this series , as set out in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of paper  v , based on the transformations of @xcite .",
    "the magnitude scatter @xmath36 in table  [ tbl4 ] is based on the estimated measuring errors in the photometry of the individual epochs . in the case of @xmath37 , the _ external _ uncertainty from the @xcite procedure",
    "is listed , since it is more robust and realistic . the quality index discussed above",
    "is also listed .",
    "other columns of table  [ tbl4 ] are explained later in the text .",
    "as in the previous papers of this series we adopt the p - l relation in @xmath22 from madore & freedman ( 1991 ) as    @xmath38    whose companion relation in @xmath35 is @xmath39 the zero - point of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is based on an assumed lmc modulus of 18.50 .",
    "the p - l relations in @xmath22 and @xmath35 for the 62 cepheids in table  [ tbl4 ] are shown in fig .",
    "the filled circles show objects with periods between 20 and 65 days that have a quality index of 3 or higher .",
    "the filled circles show smaller scatter , and delineate the p - l relation .",
    "the solid lines show the canonical slopes of the p - l relations in @xmath22 and @xmath35 with the vertical offset for apparent distance moduli @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "these values were chosen to be in visual conformity with the points shown as filled circles ( they are not intended as a formal derivation of distance ) . the expected spread in each of the pass - bands due to the finite width of the instability strip ( @xcite )",
    "is indicated by the flanking dashed lines .",
    "the observed scatter of the data outside these envelope lines are due to the combination of ( 1 ) measuring and systematic errors due to background and contamination , ( 2 ) the random error of photon statistics , ( 3 ) the large effects of the variable extinction evident from the dust lanes seen in the images , and ( 4 ) objects mis - identified as cepheids .",
    "the period cut - off of 20 days for the filled circles is chosen to prevent a bias at the faint end because cepheids at short periods that are at the faint end of the intrinsic scatter about the mean p - l relation and fall below the detection limit in brightness do not populate the p - l relation , which adversely affects the fitting of the p - l relation .",
    "a period cut is unbiased , but the value of the shortest included period depends on the magnitude limit of the data . for this reason it is chosen independently from one galaxy to the next : nearby galaxies can accomodate a shorter period cut , while ones that are farther require a cut at longer periods for the same magnitude detection limit .      for a first estimate , using @xmath42 ( @xcite ) along with the very preliminary apparent moduli in @xmath22 and @xmath35 of 31.05 and 30.83",
    "respectively as estimated above yields a dereddened modulus @xmath43 , ( all values quoted in sections 4.2 through 4.4 should have an additional 0.05 mag added for the ` long vs. short ' correction mentioned above to be placed at par with the final values obtained in previous papers of this series ) . to explore the presence of differential extinction and to treat the data accordingly",
    ", we use the tools developed in paper  v and used again in papers  vii ( sandage et al . 1996 ) , viii ( saha et al . 1997 ) and ix ( saha et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for each cepheid",
    "we calculate the apparent distance moduli separately in @xmath22 and in @xmath35 from the p - l relations of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and the observed @xmath44 and @xmath45 magnitudes from table  [ tbl4 ] .",
    "these apparent distance moduli , called @xmath46 and @xmath47 in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) of table  [ tbl4 ] , are calculated by @xmath48 and @xmath49 they are the same as equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of paper  v.    if the differences between the @xmath22 and @xmath35 moduli are due solely to reddening , and if the dependence of the reddening curve on wavelength is the normal standard dependence as in the galaxy , then the true modulus @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ratio of total to selective absorption , @xmath53 .",
    "this is equation ( 8) of paper  v. however , equation ( 5 ) is valid only if the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is due to extinction , not to correlated measuring errors , in which case the value of @xmath54 would _ not _ be given by the normal extinction curve where @xmath42 and the ratio of absorption to reddening is @xmath55 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it will be shown that such coupled errors clearly exist , and the derivation of the true distance modulus is considerably more complicated than would be the case in the absence of the correlated systematic measuring errors .",
    "the values of @xmath56 are listed in column 9 of table  [ tbl4 ]",
    ". these would be the true moduli , as corrected for normal extinction , assuming that there are no systematic measuring errors .",
    "the total rms uncertainty for each @xmath56 value is listed in column 10 .",
    "this uncertainty includes contributions from the estimated random measuring errors in the mean @xmath22 and @xmath35 magnitudes , ( in columns 4 and 6 ) , as propagated through the de - reddening procedure , as well as the uncertainty associated with the intrinsic width of the p - l relation ( i.e. a given cepheid may not be on the mean ridge - line of the p - l relation ) as well as a ten percent uncertainty in the estimated period .",
    "the de - reddening procedure amplifies the measuring errors .",
    "therefore many cepheids are needed to beat down these large errors ( notice the very large values in column 10 ) in any final value of the modulus .",
    "the values shown in column 10 of table  4 were calculated using equation 18 of @xcite , and also correspond to @xmath57 as defined in paper  v.    it is important to mention that two regrettable chains of of error have propagated through our series of papers that concern the calculation of the uncertainties in @xmath56 .",
    "the first is that equation ( 11 ) in paper  v for the calculation of @xmath58 was incorrectly given , and its correction given in paper  ix was also in error : its use would be tantamount to assuming that the intrinsic width of the p - l relation is uncorrelated in the two passbands .",
    "the program that calculates these values was examined , and found to be coded correctly , according to equation ( 18 ) of @xcite .",
    "however , an error in coding the uncertainty due to the uncertainty in period estimates resulted in _ overestimates _ of @xmath57 in our previous papers that can be corrected as follows : @xmath59 the values of @xmath57 have been used in papers v , viii and ix for calculating weighted means of @xmath56 , using @xmath60 as weights .",
    "the effect of our prior miscalculations was to ` flatten ' the weights , an effect that is , however , benign : it makes the weighted averages more like unweighted ones , although the objects with egregious measurement errors were still successfully down - weighted .",
    "the final distance moduli using weighted averages are unaffected at the @xmath61 mag level , and unweighted averages are completely unchanged .    from the data in table  [ tbl4 ] ,",
    "the unweighted mean dereddened modulus @xmath62 for all cepheids with periods from 20 to 65 days with @xmath63 is @xmath64 mag , and the weighted ( by @xmath65 value is @xmath66 mag .",
    "closer examination reveals that the cepheids in chip  4 systematically give lower distance moduli : the weighted average @xmath67 is @xmath68 for the 12 chip  4 cepheids alone ( same period and @xmath31 cut ) , but @xmath69 for the 15 cepheids in the remaining 3 chips .",
    "the corresponding unweighted averages are @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the average ( unweighted ) _ apparent _ moduli @xmath72 for these two samples are @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively",
    ". the corresponding ( unweighted ) values for @xmath75 are @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the apparent modulus .",
    "the large discrepancy in the @xmath35 moduli suggests a possible problem with the chip  4 photometry in @xmath35 .",
    "this is investigated further in  4.3 . including cepheids with @xmath78",
    "typically drops the dereddened modulus by 0.1 mag , while raising the cut to higher @xmath31 makes no noticeable difference .",
    "we note again that the derived @xmath56 values depend on the assumption that the differences between @xmath46 and @xmath47 are due to reddening alone , in the absence of appreciable systematic and correlated measuring errors , or when the errors for @xmath79 _ are distributed symmetrically_. if correlated and/or asymmetrical errors in @xmath22 and @xmath35 dominate over differential reddening , thereby producing a ratio of the @xmath22-to-@xmath35 errors that is different from 2.43 , the @xmath56 derived via equation ( 5 ) _ will be systematically in error_.    in particular , several cepheids which were discovered in @xmath22 are too faint in @xmath35 to be measured , as already mentioned .",
    "this introduces a selection effect that biases against cepheids with bluer colors .",
    "the effect is most pronounced at short periods where the _ intrinsic _ colors are bluest .",
    "this effect gives an asymmetrical distribution of errors in @xmath79 in the sense that it makes the de - reddened modulus _",
    "too small_. this is likely to be more acute for the case of chip  4 , where the cepheids are mostly in regions of extremely high surface brightness and crowding .    in paper",
    "v we devised a method to test for the presence of differential extinction or for the fact that the scatter about the p - l relation is due predominantly to measuring errors , or a combination of both .",
    "the method , shown in fig .",
    "11 of paper  v for ngc  4536 and explained in the appendix there , has been used also in papers vi , viii and ix .",

    "if there is a systematic trend of the data along a line of slope @xmath80 , then equation ( 5 ) applies and there is clearly differential reddening . if , on the other hand , there is a general scatter with no trend , that scatter is dominated by measuring errors . while in the latter case bona - fide differential extinction can be hidden by measuring errors , trying to correct for putative reddening will result in interpreting any asymmetry in the error distribution as specious extinction . in two of the three previous cases , ngc  4536 ( paper  v ) , and ngc  4496a ( saha et al .",
    "1996b , paper  vi ) there is no trend along a differential reddening line . in the third case of ngc  4639 ( paper  viii ) , there is a slight trend but also large scatter showing that the spread of points appears to be due to a mixture of measurement errors as well as from differential extinction .",

    "do not lie within any reddening track : translating the reddening band in this figure would not materially reduce the number of points that would spill out of it .",
    "there may be some differential reddening , but the visible trend is that for the ` good ' cepheids ( filled circles ) the @xmath46 values do not show any trend with @xmath82 .",
    "this is a strong pointer that the range of @xmath82 is not due to extinction , but due to measurement errors .",
    "the relative constancy of the @xmath46 values in fig .",
    "[ fig7](top ) suggests that the _ differential _ extinction is smaller than can be detected , given the errors in the data .",
    "the range of values in @xmath82 must then be due to i - band photometry errors .",
    "this prediction can easily be checked by making the @xmath35-band analog , shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where @xmath47 rather than @xmath46 is shown , and the slope and width of the locus of where the reddened cepheids should lie is appropriately changed .",
    "the points shown with concentric outer circles are for cepheids in chip 4 .",
    "the ` good ' cepheids follow a slope @xmath83 , which confirms the prediction that the range in @xmath82 is due to unaccounted for errors in the @xmath35-band photometry ( see section 3.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "note also that most of the objects that are overly bright in @xmath35 are to be found on chip 4 , which is the most crowded part of the galaxy .",
    "an alternate perspective is to plot just @xmath46 vs. @xmath47 , which is shown in fig .",
    "the reddening vector is shown by the solid line , whereas the points seem to stretch along a slope of unity ( dashed line ) . in paper",
    "ix we discussed how confusion errors that are correlated in the two passbands can produce arbitrary slopes .",
    "the results of simulation experiments performed using an identical photometry procedure on data very similar to the one at hand ( saha et al . 2000 ) show that the slope of the correlated errors is about unity .",
    "the extreme points , which are expected to be outliers anyway , seem to follow the results of the simulations , lending credence to the hypothesis that they are the result of confusion errors .",
    "it is possible that the remaining points are partially afflicted with confusion noise , in which case the simple use of equation ( 5 ) will result in systematic errors .",
    "additional examination of the data by different methods is essential , and is done in   4.3 and 4.4 .",
    "this is not to deny the presence of differential reddening , but an acknowledgement that the measurement errors in @xmath35 dominate the color spread .",
    "we proceed by making an additional restriction of the data by color .",
    "note that such a restriction used in conjunction with equation ( 5 ) does not introduce a procedural bias in the distance modulus .",
    "the observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) obtained from dophot photometry on the deep ( combining all epochs ) images is shown individually in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for each of the regions in the four different chips .",
    "two things are noteworthy :    1 .   the general appearance of the cmds from chips 1 , 2 and 3 is not unlike the cmd shown in fig  14 of paper v for ngc 4536 , with the difference that the blue edge , which is quite sharply defined for ngc  4536 , shows some smearing for the ngc  4527 field , and is placed 0.2 mag or more redder than for ngc  4536 .",
    "this only confirms the general level of reddening that we have already surmised from the cepheids , and expected , given the appearance of ngc  4527 with its pronounced dust lanes .",
    "it is apparent that the cmd obtained from chip  4 is different from the other chips : there are a disproportionate number of stars that are more luminous than in the other chips",
    ". it would be nearly absurd to think this a real feature , and as we show below , it indicates a problem with the photometry at these high levels of surface brightness , crowding , and dust structure .    the cmd anomaly for chip  4 with respect to the remaining chips",
    "is seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where the same cmds are plotted , but with @xmath1 on the ordinate . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the cmd for the chip  4 region alone is shown , but it is broken down by quadrant sub - regions .",
    "the anomaly is clearly visible for the upper - left and lower - left quadrants , but not noticeable in the two right hand quadrants .",
    "it is immediately clear from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , that the anomaly appears in the very bright areas where crowding is most severe , and where dust lanes cut up the background continuity severely .",
    "this anomaly in the photometry is not entirely unexpected .",
    "it has been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite that photometric blending in overcrowded fields may lead to a systematic underestimate of distances .",
    "however , it has also been the subject of thorough empirical investigation by saha et al . ( 2000 ) and @xcite .",
    "the latter authors , who have run simulation experiments with artificial star frames , find no empirical evidence for such large systematic drifts in photometry with crowding in excess of a few hundredths of a magnitude ( which can lead to distance underestimates by @xmath84 mag ) .",
    "these studies were done before data were available for ngc  3627 and now ngc  4527 , which are by far the data - sets most afflicted by high surface brightness , crowding , and dust - lane structure . of these ngc  3627",
    "is the closer galaxy , and crowding effects are less likely to have been explicitly noticed .",
    "it appears that dophot does not produce reliable photometry in the overly crowded sub - regions of chip  4 for ngc  4527 .",
    "recall that earlier in this paper , the scatter in the @xmath35 photometry for the cepheids was surmised to be worse than for @xmath22 , while the anomaly in the cmd appears equally bad for @xmath22 and @xmath35 .",
    "the selection process for cepheids , which includes not only a consideration for the light amplitude , but also a _ visual _ inspection of each candidate cepheid on the @xmath22 ( but not @xmath35 ) image will result in rejecting objects that are likely to be mismeasured in @xmath22 .",
    "however , the same objects may be contaminated seriously in @xmath35 , and the equivalent checks for object rejection in @xmath35 were not in place .",
    "this may be the explanation of the empirical conclusion made earlier that the color - spread is dominated not by differential extinction alone , but by error excursions in the @xmath35 photometry .",
    "consider now the sample of cepheids with @xmath85 and @xmath63 and including only those objects from chip 4 that lie on the right hand half , away from the crowded regions ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this sample of 19 cepheids includes 4 from chip  4 , and yields a true modulus @xmath87 using an unweighted average , and @xmath88 when weighted by the inverse variance .",
    "the apparent ( unweighted ) distance modulus in @xmath22 for this sample of cepheids is @xmath89 , and in @xmath35 we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "this implies an average characteristic reddening of @xmath91 .",
    "we examine the period - color ( p - c ) relation to identify cepheids in our sample that lie close to the intrinsic @xmath92 period relation for unreddened cepheids . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , the p - c relation for the cepheids in ngc  4527 are shown .",
    "cepheids with @xmath85 and @xmath63 are shown as filled circles . the ridge line for unreddened cepheids in the galaxy ,",
    "lmc and smc as summarized in @xcite from data by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is shown by the dashed line . the p - c relation implied by equations 1 and 2",
    "is shown by the continuous line .",
    "it is obvious from this figure , that hardly any of the cepheids observed in ngc  4527 are unreddened .",
    "the overall trend in the data has a steeper slope with period than the intrinsic p - c relation  since the longest period objects are probably the most strongly reddened , or because they lie in the super - crowded regions of chip  4 .",
    "note that selecting by color does _ not _ introduce an _ a priori _ bias in the distance determination ( although one must never use such a sample to estimate reddening ) .",
    "when looking at cepheids in a disk , we expect to see ones that are reddened very little because they are on the near side of the dust sheet in the disk , and also those that are reddened substantially since they are seen through the disk and possibly through dust lanes .",
    "the rationale for a color - cut is that while bona - fide extinction should not affect the dereddened distance modulus irrespective of how the data are cut in color , photometric errors and stars mis - classified as cepheids , which do affect the modulus , can be identified and rejected .",
    "a plot of @xmath56 vs. apparent color ( not shown ) for the data at hand easily demonstrates that the derived distance is a strong function of the measured color , showing again , that the data are dominated by measurement errors .",
    "a way to proceed is to try various cuts by color , and choose the one(s ) that produce the p - l relations with the least scatter in both passbands .",
    "following such a path , we were able to identify two cuts that result in p - l relations without significant outliers :    1 .",
    "a cut containing cepheids bluer than @xmath93 but also with @xmath94 to remove blue outliers .",
    "objects within the cut appear to follow the slope of the fiducial p - c relation , whereas objects that appear redder follow an anomalously steeper slope . in any case , these are the cepheids that appear to have minimal reddening . further restricting the data to include only cepheids for which @xmath85 and @xmath63 , to avoid the selection effect at the shortest periods ( sandage 1988 ) we obtain a weighted average from 16 objects : @xmath95 , and an unweighted average @xmath96 .",
    "the apparent modulus in @xmath22 from the same sample of cepheids is @xmath97 , which is expected to be biased towards brighter than average due to the color selection .",
    "a better cut is one that runs parallel to the fiducial p - c relation , as shown in the figure by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , drawn 0.2 mag below and 0.3 mag above the mean relation for unreddened cepheids .",
    "the 13 cepheids included yield @xmath98 ( weighted ) and @xmath99 ( unweighted ) .",
    "the @xmath22 modulus for this sample yields @xmath100 , which again is expected to be biased towards brighter than average , since we have selected the least reddened cepheids .",
    "moving these cuts redward by even 0.2 mag begins to admit outliers into the resulting p - l relations .",
    "we have detailed two independent ways of selecting the cepheids with more reliable photometry , given that there is an obvious difficulty with the magnitudes in the very crowded regions .",
    "one method selected objects by spatial position , away from the very crowded and high surface brightness regions which are also crossed by dust lanes .",
    "the other uses color as a diagnostic , on the premise that while rejecting an otherwise well measured but very reddened cepheid does not introduce a systematic bias , objects that have extreme colors often appear so due to noise , and not because they are in fact reddened .",
    "these independent approaches yield very similar samples of cepheids , and the de - reddened modulus ranges from 30.55 to 30.68 , with characteristic internal rms uncertainties of order 0.12 mag , which is comparable to the case to case scatter .",
    "recall that one must add 0.05 mag to bring the values at par with the `` long vs short '' corrections applied in previous papers of this series : since this applies equally to both passbands , it applies directly to the de - reddened modulus also .",
    "including this adjustment , it is reasonable to adopt the central value of the range , and carry forward the case to case scatter which is also the internal rms scatter for each case as a conservative error estimate : @xmath101    from the best case for the v - band apparent modulus , using the unweighted averages of the samples with period and quality cuts only ( i.e. no color cut ) , and propagating the uncertainties from the internal scatter : @xmath102    from a similar consideration of the @xmath22 and @xmath35 band apparent moduli , ( but disregarding the case of the color cut which biases the colors ) , we get a characteristic average reddening for the cepheids : @xmath103 where an additional systematic calibration uncertainties of @xmath104 mag should be added in quadrature .",
    "[ fig12plus ] shows the p - l relations in @xmath22 and @xmath35 again , but this time with the lines showing the above adopted moduli , and with filled circles showing the sample that have @xmath63 , @xmath105 , and where cepheids in chip 4 are included only if they have positions with @xmath106 .",
    "the uncertainty in the photometry of cepheids from data like the one at hand is dominated by both effects of crowding and object confusion , as well as from the difficulty of measuring reliable aperture magnitudes for at least a few stars in the field of view of each ccd chip .",
    "independent determination of aperture magnitudes for a given chip using only the cepheid data ( typically no suitable bright isolated but unsaturated stars exist in these fields ) results in aperture corrections with scatter of order 0.2 mag .",
    "fortunately , the wfpc2 psfs are stable , and the aperture corrections can be ` imported ' by different means .",
    "the method by which our dophot based procedure does this was described in paper  v , with an augmentation described in paper  ix .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of systematic errors in the method can not be ruled out , particularly as a result of possible long - term drifts in the optics and instrument .",
    "different crowded field programs , with their different approaches to handling object confusion , will produce somewhat different results .",
    "intercomparing such results produces a more realistic handle on the true systematics .",
    "this was the underlying reason for repeating the data reduction in section  4 using the romafot package , which was developed for crowded fields . because the romafot path provides an independent evaluation of the photometry including the aperture correction , we averaged the results of both paths rather than to use the romafot results as a rough confirmatory of the dophot results .",
    "note that due to differences in approach between the two methods , including different sets of cepheids and quality indices , the post - photometry analysis can not always be done identically .",
    "the methods best suited to the strengths and limitations of romafot are used : the final comparison however should reflect realistic systematic errors , albeit to the extent possible by comparing only two paths .",
    "all observations were preprocessed by the standard pipeline as described by @xcite .",
    "the back - to - back exposures were then co - added by an anticoincidence technique in order to remove cosmic - ray hits ( @xcite ) .",
    "the co - added exposures were aligned to within the nearest whole pixel before the exposures were co - added again to create a deep frame in each color .",
    "all 12 epochs in @xmath0 and all 5 epochs in @xmath1 were used to create the deep images in order to get a better signal to noise ratio .",
    "the psfs for each epoch and filter and for the deep frames were determined empirically from the co - added frames , mean psfs were established with the observed data set , not with external data .",
    "this underlying philosophy implies the use of stars which cover the whole chip if possible in order to take into account for the spatially varying psf of wfpc2 .",
    "only relatively bright and isolated objects were used to create the different psfs . for this purpose romafot",
    "was run in a mode in which the shape parameter of the moffat function was allowed to vary .",
    "empirical tests have shown that a moffat function fits the shape of the psf better than a gauss function .",
    "romafot does not discriminate between stars , remaining cosmic - rays and galaxies , therefore badly fitted objects were deleted from this sample after examination of the observed and the fitted shape of each object .",
    "the appropriate psf was fitted to the deep frame , separately in @xmath22 and @xmath35 .",
    "objects brighter than a certain limit were selected and subtracted from the deep frame .",
    "these objects are used as a master list for every single epoch .",
    "the positions at different epochs are slightly different to those of the deep frame .",
    "the corresponding offsets have been calculated using a matching algorithm and are added for every epoch .",
    "the objects were then fitted on the individual frames with the corresponding psf and subsequently subtracted from them .",
    "the procedure was repeated on the residual frames several times in an iterative process cutting at fainter and fainter limits .",
    "the results are files giving instrumental magnitudes in @xmath22 and @xmath35 for the deep frames and the individual frames , and each containing more than 10000 stars for each chip and filter .      the identification of the variable stars is again based on the method described by @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath107 and the standard deviation @xmath108 of the instrumental magnitudes over all epochs in @xmath0 were used to identify the variable candidates .",
    "we have used here @xmath109 , i.e. the lowest smoothed value , obtained by varying the period between 1 and 90 days .",
    "several hundred stars were suspected to be variable on the basis of romafot photometry .",
    "the light curves of these possible candidates with reasonable values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 were individually inspected by eye , they were scrutinized and 64 cepheid candidates were retained that were also selected by dophot .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tbl5 ] .",
    "column  1 gives the designation of the probable cepheid , columns  2 - 4 give the dophot mean magnitudes in @xmath22 and @xmath35 and the quality class , and columns  5 - 7 give the romafot mean magnitudes ( as derived below ) as well as the quality index ( @xmath31 ) of the cepheids .",
    "the @xmath31s were estimated similarly as in section  3 , but independently and based on romafot alone .",
    "37 cepheids were judged to be useful from the romafot photometry ( qi @xmath110 3 ) , 26 of which are among the cepheids which have been used for the derivation of the distance modulus in section 5.6 .",
    "the phase - weighted mean @xmath111 and @xmath112 magnitudes have been converted to johnson @xmath22 and cousins @xmath35 using the equations given by @xcite .",
    "in particular the romafot instrumental magnitudes were transformed in a recursive manner . instead of the unknown standard colors , first the flight colors and then the ground colors were transformed .",
    "the main problem is to tie the fitted magnitudes to the instrumental magnitudes using an aperture of @xmath113 radius , the so - called aperture correction ( ac ) .",
    "this is because the transformations given by @xcite refer to an circular aperture of @xmath113 radius .",
    "the ac is the correction from the model psf to the circular aperture , and its value strongly depends on the chosen sky values .",
    "the value of the ac should be evaluated in principle from the ngc  4527 frames for each chip , filter and epoch separately .    due to the lack of bright isolated stars with constant background on ngc 4527 frames , the values for the aperture correction",
    "have also been calculated with the globular clusters pal4 [ @xmath28 archive data , proposal 5672 , pi : j. hesser ] and g319 in m31 [ @xmath28 archive data , proposal 6671 , pi : r.m .",
    "the latter was observed in 1999 and lies closest to the date of the present observations .",
    "all observations were ` long ' observations having exposure times of more than 1000 seconds .",
    "because of crowding , blends and varying background values the proper calculation of the ac is much more difficult than to establish a psf , furthermore external archive data were useful in order to calculate systematic errors .",
    "both globular clusters have many isolated , bright , but not saturated stars with a flat sky . in first approximation",
    "the growth curves of stars in the galaxy frames and the globular cluster frames are expected to be the same , but jitter and focus changes and aging effects of the ccd do affect the inner core of the psf .    since the determination of the sky is crucial , the local sky was allowed to vary until the growth curves were flat .",
    "only stars with flat growth curves were considered , stars with rising or falling growth curves up to @xmath114 radius were rejected .",
    "no ac dependence with position on the chip , position within one pixel , or the level of background were found .",
    "however there is a weak tendency , yet only on the galaxy frames , that stars with broader fwhm yield higher acs .",
    "the ac determined for the galaxy frames depends therefore somewhat on the selection of the reference stars .",
    "we have selected 20@xmath11530 reference stars per frame with moderately small scatter .",
    "to first order , the changes in the intrinsic psf are radial .",
    "if using a constant psf were to produce systematic position dependent errors in the photometry , they should show up as differences between stars near the center of a chip versus those on the outside areas of the chip .",
    "since romafot used a constant psf , such a trend should show up as a systematic position dependent variation of the ac .",
    "an examination of the typical rms star - by - star scatter for the ac in ( say ) the pal  4 data is @xmath116 mag .",
    "this value does not change by more than @xmath117 whether one considers the innermost @xmath118 pixel region , or the whole chip .",
    "this is an indication that systematic differences in the ac between inner and outer regions is no more than 0.08 mag . given this state of affairs",
    ", it is not possible to evaluate any reliable ac dependence on position from these data .",
    "nevertheless , since the mean computed ac s reflect the average over the entire chip , unless the cepheids are distributed extremely non - uniformly , this concern can increase the scatter in the cepheid to cepheid relative moduli , but should not change the mean results from a sample of cepheids .",
    "the value of the ac from ngc  4527 is slighty larger than from the globular clusters .",
    "the choice of the ac has therefore some effect on the distance modulus which is discussed in more detail in section  5.6 .",
    "finally the magnitudes were corrected to the ` long exposure ' calibration scale by adding @xmath119 mags in @xmath22 and @xmath35 as in  4.5 .",
    "the two masterlists in @xmath22 and @xmath35 were joined to form a set of about 15000 stars with @xmath120 for which @xmath22 _ and _ @xmath35 are known .",

    "the systematic error in @xmath67 appears to be small as gleaned by the case to case scatter , since the changes in the aperture corrections for @xmath22 and @xmath35 appear to change from case to case in a way that attenuates the variation in @xmath67 .",
    "if we assume this to be chance coincidence , and that systematic errors in measuring the aperture corrections in @xmath22 and @xmath35 are uncorrelated , the systematic error in @xmath67 ought to be the one from propagating the systematic errors from @xmath72 and @xmath75 , thus giving @xmath134 mag per case .",
    "but such an estimate disregards the correlated color variation due to differential extinction , and is likely to be an overestimate .",

    "the moduli in @xmath22 and @xmath35 lead  with @xmath135  to the true moduli in the last column of table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] .",
    "the indicated errors of the true moduli are dominated by the error in @xmath136 .",
    "this compromise solution is estimated to have a systematic error of approximately @xmath137 mag in @xmath67 .",
    "we have presented the preferred distance estimates from dophot (  4.5 ) and romafot ( above ) values of distance modulus for ngc  4527 .",
    "the various cases discussed for both sets of reduction / analysis are presented in table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] . for the romafot reductions we calculate ( for the preferred aperture correction ) the results for the cuts made for the dophot data analysis , which are also given in table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] .",
    "the slightly larger moduli from romafot are consistent with the fact that this photometry package in combination with the adopted ac yields generally magnitudes roughly @xmath138 fainter than dophot .",
    "work to address this zeropoint offset is in progress , along with more complete simulations of romafot s performance .",
    "an inspection of table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] shows that the preferred estimates of the two methods , as well as estimates from cuts that eliminate suspect data from _ both _ methods differ by 0.11 to 0.21 mag , in the sense that romafot gives the larger moduli . averaging the unweighted preferred estimates from each approach",
    "gives @xmath139 , which is well within the uncertainty estimates of each method ( even within the _ weighted _",
    "uncertainty for the dophot estimates ) .",
    "for an overall uncertainty we could statistically combine the individual uncertainties from the two methods , but we prefer to be conservative and carry over the value common to each of the two methods , thus obtaining : @xmath140 which corresponds to @xmath141 mpc .",
    "the systematic error is estimated from the scatter in derived dereddened moduli for the various ` method / selection ' cases for both dophot and romafot based reductions listed in table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] .",
    "note that the distance moduli from the acceptable ( i.e. no obvious problems identified ) subsamples listed in table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] range from 30.60 to 30.93 , with favored values between 30.60 and 30.88 .",
    "these numbers demonstrate the degree to which the distance determination is robust .",
    "the best estimates from dophot and the best compromise solution from romafot for @xmath72 are in remarkable agreement , even though the samples are formally different .",
    "we average them and retain the larger of the two uncertainties to reflect the real dispersion among the cepheids .",
    "the adopted values for @xmath75 for the two methods differ by @xmath142 mag .",
    "again we average the moduli and keep the larger uncertainty .",
    "the final numbers are shown in the final row of table 8 .",
    "the systematic variations in @xmath72 and @xmath143 as seen from case to case within dophot and romafot are not inconsistent with these adopted uncertainties .",
    "in particular , note that for the selected samples without a color - cut , @xmath72 values range from 31.12 to 31.27 from dophot , and from 31.09 to 31.42 from romafot , since a direct @xmath22 band comparison to sn  1991 t is made later  6.1 .    the distance hflich & khoklov ( 1996 ) derived for sn1991 t from modelling its light curve and spectrum is @xmath144 .",
    "@xcite estimated an upper limit of 15 mpc ( @xmath145 ) for sn1991 t , by modeling the polarized emission from its light echo .",
    "the most comprehensive photometry for sn1991 t , which was discovered 12 days before maximum light , is presented in @xcite . the maximum brightness in @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "is seen to be : @xmath146 combining the @xmath22 maximum with the adopted modulus @xmath147 in table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] gives    @xmath148    this value holds only under the assumption that sn1991 t suffers the same absorption as the cepheids in ngc4527 .",
    "the uncertainty reflects the realistic error in the _ average _",
    "@xmath72 for a cepheid : the random error estimates for @xmath149 given in table  [ tab : romafot_distances ] are convolved with the statistical errors gleaned from the different acceptable cases shown in the same table .",
    "an individual object can be quite different , depending on where it is located with respect to the dust , and so it is quite likely that the absorption of the sn is different .",
    "therefore we attempt to estimate its reddening independently in the following sub - section .",
    "the galactic absorption to ngc4527 is given by @xcite to be @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the total absorption must be larger and is estimated in the following ways .",
    "a first approximation is obtained by assuming that sn1991 t has the same reddening as the cepheids on average , i.e.  @xmath152 ( mean of dophot and romafot ) , and hence @xmath153 .    if it is assumed that sn1991 t has the same intrinsic color as blue , branch - normal sneia , i.e.  @xmath154 with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath155 ( @xcite ) , one obtains @xmath156 with equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "( an estimate of @xmath136 is not attempted , because standard sneia have a wider color scatter of @xmath157 ) .",
    "if , instead , it is argued that the spectroscopically peculiar sn1991 t can not be compared with the colors of standard sneia , it can be compared with its spectroscopic twin sn1995ac ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter has ",
    "after correction for galactic reddening following @xcite  @xmath158 . this yields for sn1991 t @xmath159 ( estimated error ) .",
    "phillips et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) have suggested that all sneia evolve similarly in color at late phases in their light curves , i.e. 50 days past maximum .",
    "they argue that since this is based on the nebular phase of sne , it is expected to be more robust than the color at maximum .",
    "accordingly , they obtain a total reddening of sn1991 t corresponding to @xmath160 .",
    "this value may have to be reduced to @xmath161 because their adopted mean color of all sneia is 0.04 bluer on average than found by parodi et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    from the strong ca and na interstellar absorption lines in the spectrum of sn1991 t at the radial velocity of ngc4527 , ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and @xcite have concluded @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "the various reddening estimates are consistent with an adopted value of @xmath164 ( i.e. the mean and standard deviation of the various estimates listed above ) , which was also favored by @xcite , who adopted @xmath165 .",
    "this value is not significantly different from the mean reddening of the cepheids in ngc4527 . with @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and",
    "@xmath168 one obtains then a total absorption of @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 , leading to the true magnitudes of sn1991 t of @xmath172 together with the true modulus of ngc4527 from table  8 , this yields absolute magnitudes of @xmath173 when these magnitudes are compared with the mean absolute magnitude of eight blue standard sneia , whose luminosities are calibrated through cepheids ( @xcite ) ; one finds an overluminosity of sn1991 t of @xmath174 these differences are further reduced by @xmath175 if one compares sn1991",
    "t with standard sneia of equally slow lightcurve decline of , @xmath176 [ cf .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 3)-(5 ) ] .",
    "yet the comparison remains inconclusive because of the large errors of the absolute magnitudes of sn1991 t which are dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath177 . within the errors it is possible that @xmath178 and @xmath179 are up to @xmath180 brighter than for normal sneia .",
    "however , a high value would cause difficulties with @xmath181 . from equation  ( [ eq:13 ] )",
    "sn1991 t is , with @xmath182 , the bluest snia known , and any increase of @xmath177 above the adopted value can make it only bluer .    it might be argued that sn1991 t , as a peculiar snia , may be as blue in @xmath183 as it wants . however , its spectroscopic twin sn1995ac ( see below ) has @xmath184 , after correction for galactic absorption , which is close to the mean value of normal sneia of @xmath185 ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course it is more telling to compare the bolometric luminosities instead of the absolute magnitudes in different pass bands .",
    "standard sneia with @xmath186 ( @xcite ) and a bolometric correction of @xmath187 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have @xmath188 .",
    "sn1991 t had a larger fraction of its energy in the near ultraviolet near maximum and its bolometric correction is therefore @xmath189 ( fisher et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and hence with equation  ( 14 ) @xmath190 , which is brighter by @xmath191 than standard sneia .",
    "it lies not in the scope of this paper to decide whether the ( poorly determined ) excess luminosity of sneia can be fuelled by a chandrasekhar mass or not ( cf .",
    "fisher et  al.1999 ) .",
    "the w - cloud is known to have a considerable depth ( federspiel , tamman & sandage 1998 ) .",
    "it is therefore not too surprising that the distance of ngc  4527 of @xmath192 ( @xmath141 mpc ) is even somewhat smaller by 0.3 - 0.4 mag than the cepheid distances of the two neighboring galaxies ngc  4536 and ngc  4496a ( saha et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "the three galaxies have - with observed velocities near @xmath193 ( sandage & tammann 1987 ) - large peculiar velocities .",
    "they lie apparently on the near side of the virgo cluster , probably infalling for the first time ( tully & shaya 1984 ) .",
    "the consequence of the small cepheid distance of ngc4527 is that the suspected overluminosity ( fisher et  al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) of sn1991 t becomes marginal .",
    "the excess luminosity in @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 depends entirely on the adopted internal extinction @xmath177 .",
    "however , because of its negative bolometric correction sn1991 t seems to have a higher bolometric luminosity by @xmath197 than standard sneia , a difference still barely at the 2 sigma level .",
    "a few other sneia are known which have similar spectra , i.e.sn1997cw ( @xcite ) , sn1998ab ( @xcite ) , sn1998es ( @xcite ) , and sn1999cw ( @xcite ) , as well as sn1995bd and sn1995ac ( @xcite ) , and sn1997br ( @xcite ) for which additional photometry is available .",
    "some photometric parameters of the three latter are compared with sn1991 t in table  [ tbl : sne ] .",
    "it is a curious fact that sn1991 t received much attention because of its seemingly high luminosity which is now marginal at best in the light of the new cepheid distance , while its spectroscopic twin sn1995ac , which was discovered later , appears to be considerably overluminous indeed .",
    "it should be noted that the overluminosity of sn1995ac is independent of any adopted value of @xmath198 because it lies @xmath199 above the hubble line of standard sneia and its recession velocity of @xmath200 can not significantly be altered by peculiar motions .",
    "sn1995bd does not shed additional light on the discrepancy between sn1991 t and sn1995ac .",
    "it is strongly absorbed by galactic dust , i.e.  @xmath201 according to @xcite , but remains somewhat underluminous and very red in @xmath202 after a corresponding correction . if it is assumed that it suffers additional internal absorption and that its color @xmath202 is that of standard sneia and similar to its two counterparts , it becomes extremely overluminous .",
    "the latter conclusion holds for any reasonable value of @xmath198 . even adopting an extreme value of @xmath203",
    "makes it have @xmath204 . for @xmath205 , the absolute magnitude becomes @xmath206 using again the large absorption correction .",
    "unfortunately the case of sn1997br is even more ambiguous .",
    "@xcite find this object more reddened than sn1991 t by @xmath207 , which with the color excess adopted for the latter gives @xmath208 for sn1997br in good agreement with @xmath209 from the na absorption line ( li et  al .",
    "1999 ) . with @xmath210 sn1997br becomes clearly overluminous .",
    "however , we have adopted the individual recession velocity of eso 576-g40 , host of sn1997br , namely @xmath211 ( li et  al .",
    "1999 ) which becomes @xmath212 after correction for virgocentric infall .",
    "@xcite have instead adopted the mean velocity of @xmath213 of the ngc5084/87 group , of which eso 576-g40 may be a member .",
    "in addition they assume only @xmath214 . with these different precepts sn1997br becomes @xmath215 fainter than listed in table  [ tbl : sne ] and",
    "the sn takes roughly the luminosities and colors of standard sneia .    in spite of all uncertainties it seems unavoidable that sn1991t - like objects form a very heterogeneous class .",
    "even if one treats the extinction as a free parameter they differ significantly either in luminosity or in color or both",
    ". some may require more than the chandrasekhar mass , like sn1995ac , others not .",
    "it is remarkable that three out of four sneia in table  [ tbl : sne ] have an internal extinction of probably @xmath216 which is quite unusual among known standard sneia .",
