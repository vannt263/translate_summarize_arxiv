    "hot jupiters are an unique class of extrasolar planets ( exoplanets ) known for their proximity to their host stars and their large masses . with the discovery of the first hot jupiter @xcite , we now know that understanding the physical nature of hot jupiters can play a large role in constraining our understanding of a variety of theories regarding planetary formation , disk formation , and planet migration @xcite .",
    "hot jupiters provide unique observational opportunities relative to exoplanets of other populations .",
    "the small semi - major axis of the orbits of hot jupiters increase the a priori transit probability , this coupled with a large observational transit signal due to hot jupiters large relative radii , and their short periods provide many observational opportunities upon which to identify hot jupiters and perform follow - up observations .",
    "these observational advantages are not unique to photometric observations , but also to radial velocity ( rv ) measurements where the large masses of hot jupiters increase the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity signal as well as to rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) measurements where the rm signal is proportional to the transit depth .",
    "in general , the transits provide a number of geometric ratios to relate the star and planet ( i.e. , the depth of the transit is related to the planet / star radius ratio ) , as well as the density of the star . when combined with another constraint on the mass and radius of the primary ( e.g. , derived from isochrones using the spectroscopic stellar effective temperature and metallicity ) , and a measurement of the doppler amplitude from radial velocity observations , it becomes possible to estimate the masses and radii of both the planet and star .",
    "additional measurements allow for the derivation of a large number of physical parameters , not just the planet and stellar masses and radii ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    following the discovery of systems containing hot jupiters , one generally would like to follow - up with observations to better understand the properties of the host star and planet .",
    "in general this requires additional photometric and radial velocity observations .",
    "providing stricter constraints on known hot jupiters provides predictions for future observations , increasing the efficiency of those observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is three - fold in nature .",
    "first , to present new data on xo-4b from the dedicated monitor of exotransits ( demonex ) telescope .",
    "second , we investigate the effects of choices of detrending variables , mass - radius relations , rossiter - mclaughlin models , and other models or user defined variables on the derived parameters of the system .",
    "third , we improve the parameters of xo-4 and xo-4b by globally fitting all available data in a homogeneous manner .",
    "the following sections contain summaries of all available data used in our global analysis as well as information regarding the data reduction process used for the new demonex data .",
    "new observations of xo-4b were made using the dedicated monitor of exotransits ( demonex ) @xcite .",
    "demonex was a low - cost , 0.5 meter , robotic telescope constructed from commercially - available parts operated out of winer observatory in sonoita , arizona .",
    "demonex monitored bright stars hosting known transiting planets over a three year period from 2008 - 2011 in order to provide a homogeneous data set of precise relative photometry for over 40 transiting systems .",
    "there are 20 nights of data from november 2008 to may 2010 taken during primary transits of xo-4b .",
    "all observations were made in the sloan @xmath11 band . due to issues with the mount ,",
    "5 nights were lost due to the mount pointing to the incorrect field .",
    "in addition , the demonex observing strategy prioritized full transits of other targets over partial transits of xo-4b . often , that resulted in small observing windows , which we opted to fill with observations near transit in case they happened to be useful rather than sitting idle . unfortunately , 4 nights only got data out - of - transit and 4 nights only captured the flat bottom of the transit , neither of which ended up providing useful constraints .",
    "thus we were left with an unfortunately low yield of 7/20 ( 35% ) usable nights , but we obtain 3 full transits , 2 ingresses , 2 egresses .",

    "follow - up @xmath12 observations were made by the xo extended team ( xoet ) as well as follow - up @xmath13 band photometric observations using the perkins 1.8-m telescope .",

    "to better constrain the ephemerides of the planetary transits @xcite make additional @xmath29 band ground based primary transit observations using the universidad de monterrey observatory ( udem ) 0.36-m telescope .",
    "we do not include secondary eclipse data in our data analysis , but we do include the udem @xmath29 band ground based primary transit observations in our global analysis , including the previously unpublished ut 2012 - 01 - 07 data , kindly provided by the authors .",
    "we convert the times from the @xcite udem observations from @xmath30 to @xmath23  using the idl code jdutc2jdtdb to maintain uniform time stamps across all available light curves .",
    "while this routine is intended to convert geocentric julian date from utc to tdb , it is accurate to 30 ms when using it to convert barycentric julian dates instead @xcite , which is more than sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the models used in this paper to fit the transit and orbital radial velocity data are unchanged from the original @xcite exofast paper .",
    "the original exofast paper ignores a number of effects , including rm and transit timing variations ( ttvs ) , that we now include to maintain consistency with work done by the other groups .",
    "we also consider the radial velocity data taken during transit , and as such must consider models for the rm effect @xcite . the precise model used to model the rm effect can have a significant effect on the inferred parameters , and yet this can vary from system to system @xcite .",
    "a number of rm models exist , and we investigate two separate models here .",
    "the ambiguity of the proper model of the rm effect that should be used comes from the fact that the rm effect is not , in fact , due to a change in the radial velocity of the star .",
    "the radial velocity measurement is made by estimating some measure of the `` centers '' of known absorption lines and their change in central wavelength relative to laboratory measurements .",
    "if the shape of the absorption features changes in such a way as to change the odd moments of the lines , then this can result in a change in the measured line centers , and as a result be attributed to a change in the radial velocity of the star .",
    "the precise relation between the change in the line shape and the inferred change in the line center will depend on many intrinsic properties of the star , such as its effective temperature , surface gravity , and rotation rate , as well as the precise algorithm used to estimate the line centers .",
    "thus the rm effect manifests as an anomalous radial velocity measurement @xmath31 made during the primary transit , where the anomalous signal is due to a change in the shape of the absorption feature rather than to the motion of the host star .",
    "the change in shape is due to the transiting planet preferentially blocking light emitted from the rotating host star .",
    "the blocked light , depending on the position of the planet as viewed from the observer , may be red or blue shifted relative to the center of the star due to the rotation of the host star . as this light is blocked it can introduce an asymmetry to the absorption feature @xcite . because the anomalous signal is dependent on a change in the shape of the absorption feature",
    ", the measured @xmath31 will depend heavily on the method used to measure the radial velocity signal , and whether that method is sensitive to changes in the shape of the absorption features .",
    "the rm anomalous radial velocity shift has a strong dependence on the host star s rotation @xmath9 and the orbit of the planet relative to the star s spin axis @xmath10 .",
    "the rm signal is also dependent on the radius of the planet in stellar radii @xmath32 , the limb - darkening parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the path the planet takes over star which can be described by the inclination @xmath35 and orbital distance @xmath36 or by the impact parameter @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite gives an approximation for the maximum amplitude of the rm effect as : @xmath38 when the effect is observed it is possible to place constraints on the spin - orbit alignment @xmath10 , project rotational velocity @xmath9 , and the impact parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the transit light curves and previous rv studies provide us with independent constraints on @xmath9 and @xmath37 , and these improve the constraint on @xmath10 .",
    "there are two different rm models we investigate to place the constraint on @xmath10 , those based on the moment method @xcite ( ots ) and those based on the cross - correlation method @xcite .",
    "there are other models available @xcite , but we focus on the ots and cross - correlation methods as the default model in exofast is that based on @xcite and previous work on xo-4b follows the cross - correlation method .",
    "@xcite describe their derivation of the rm effect as an approximate but accurate analytic formula for the anomaly in the radial velocity curves .",
    "their method approximates the velocity anomaly as the change in the first moment of the absorption line profile and uses only linear stellar limb - darkening .",
    "this work is followed by @xcite where the authors present theoretical predictions for the photometric and spectroscopic signatures of rings around transiting extrasolar planets that now include quadratic limb - darkening and terms for ringed extrasolar planets .",
    "these new expressions supersede the work in @xcite .    to express the radial velocity anomaly we first substitute the variable ots used to represent stellar intensity to @xmath39 to avoid confusion with the stellar inclination @xmath40 .",
    "ots define the flux of the star as a function of the position of the planet @xmath41 where x and z are the position of the center of the planet perpendicular to and parallel to , respectively , the projected rotation axis of the star , and they integrate over the surface brightness of the unocculted stellar disk @xmath39 , and @xmath42 is the surface brightness of the occulted star , such that @xmath43 in the region occulted by the planet .",
    "ots then formally express the radial velocity anomaly as the first moment of the relative flux @xmath44 where they assume rigid rotation in the star , i.e. no differential rotation such that the projected velocity is constant along lines of constant @xmath45 .",
    "when we use these expressions we ignore the potential effects of planetary rings . under this assumption , the expression can be reduced the following expression : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath45 component of the planet s position in units of stellar radii and @xmath48 is the relative flux from equation  ( [ fluxeq ] ) .",
    "the details of these expressions are included in @xcite , including detailed expressions for integrating the flux in equation  ( [ fluxeq ] ) .",
    "an alternative method to measure the rm effect is to compare the anomalous radial velocity by cross - correlation with a stellar template spectrum .",
    "this method was used by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , among others , and is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "this method involves creating an @xmath49 element star , where @xmath50 , and each element contains a solar spectrum .",
    "@xcite create a synthetic spectrum of the star by applying a stellar rotation kernel to redshift each element , multiply the spectral lines by the instrumental profile of their spectrograph , and integrate all of the elements minus those obscured by the transit to create simulated in - transit spectra .",
    "these simulated spectra are then fed through their analysis routine that fit the lines and adjust the shape of the model to best fit the data .",
    "@xcite cover in detail the choice of absorption line profile ( gaussian , voigt , etc . ) , and eventually settle on a form inspired by their gaussian approximation : @xmath51 here @xmath48 is the flux ratio and uses the same expression as that of equation  ( [ fluxeq ] ) , and @xmath52 can be expressed as the position of the planet @xmath53 the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are each functions of thermal broadening , micro - turbulent broadening , and the stellar rotation width that describe the shape of the line .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are empirically fit for each individual planetary system the method is applied to . for rigidly rotating stars",
    "@xmath56 is a constant along lines of constant @xmath45 and the expression reduces to @xmath57 and reproduces the ots @xmath58 result as noted by @xcite .    as a result , to first order , for which @xmath59 and @xmath60 , equation  ( [ eqhir ] ) reduces to equation  ( [ eqoht ] ) and the two methods are identical .    because @xmath54 and @xmath55 depend on precisely how the algorithm used to estimate the radial velocity measures the shape of the absorption profiles and the line spread function of the spectrograph , it is possible to confuse a change in line shape as instrumental and not due to the rm effect .",
    "if ignored , this can lead to a misinterpretation of the rm effect , and as such this method must be applied to each system as outlined above to distinguish between the two effects .",
    "there are cases when the moment method and cross - correlation methods produce the same results @xcite ; however , for many cases the two methods result in statistically different inferences for the derived parameters of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for reference , in the case of xo-4b , @xcite derive and report @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "to analyze the xo-4b data we use a custom version of the publicly available exofast suite of idl programs described in @xcite .",
    "this is a continuation of the same code used to fit the kelt discoveries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and includes the ability to simultaneously fit multiple transit light curves , both on the same telescope from different nights and from different telescopes , as well as the ability to include multiple radial velocity data sets .",
    "additional modifications were made by us to update the default rm models , include alternative rm models , and to change how the estimated errors are scaled on the rm data .",
    "we adopt gaussian priors from mc08 on the stellar parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] , and @xmath9 , and use the reported values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 from n10 when using the @xcite based rm models .",
    "we do ignore secondary eclipse data from @xcite and assume @xmath63 as this is consistent with all of the other groups @xcite .      as a confirmation of our light curve analysis",
    "we make many of the same assumptions used in the n10 paper and compare the output from exofast using the n10 data to the published results of the n10 paper .",
    "it should be noted that n10 include the same gaussian priors we adopt , and additionally include a gaussian prior on the period and @xmath64 from mc08 .",
    "n10 also fix the limb - darkening parameter @xmath33 and treat the second limb - darkening parameter @xmath34 as a free parameter . in exofast",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are calculated from @xmath15 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 $ ] , and the observed band - pass from @xcite . during this exercise",
    "we do not create a new free parameter for @xmath34 , nor do we fix @xmath33 , but we do include the gaussian priors on period and @xmath64 .",
    "thus our results are not precisely comparable , although we expect any differences to be relatively minor .",
    "table  [ tabnaritacomp ] contains the same parameters published in n10 ( narita@xmath65 ) along with those produced by exofast ( exofast@xmath66 ) .",
    "the values are consistent within the errors for all parameters .",
    "it should be noted that n10 use the minima in @xmath67 and @xmath68 to quote their best value and errors , where we typically quote the median values of the parameters and the 68% confidence intervals from the mcmc chains . in order to more precisely compare our results to those of n10",
    ", we also fit a multi - dimensional hyperboloid to the output mcmc chains in order to infer the values of the parameters with the minimum @xmath67 and the values where @xmath68 ( exofast@xmath65 ) .    as we did not create a new free parameter for @xmath34 , the constraint on the second limb - darkening parameter is calculated from the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 $ ] , and the band .",
    "thus the uncertainty on @xmath34 is simply a reflection on the covariance of @xmath34 with these parameters .",
    "we generally find values and uncertainties that are in good agreement with those of n10 , verifying that the methods used in n10 are comparable to those used in exofast .",
    "the final column of table  [ tabnaritacomp ] shows the differences in the two minimum @xmath67 values divided by the uncertainties in quadrature for reference .",
    "the differences between methods are less than @xmath69 and any differences may be attributable to our slightly different methods of estimating the values for the minimum @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "we did not apply an additional gaussian prior on @xmath137 ( see  [ compsec ] ) which explains the difference in our inferred value for the period relative to the published narita value.,width=302 ]    additionally we look at the effects of detrending on the inferred ttvs by enabling the time of the central transit to be a free parameter , as shown in figure  [ ttv2 ] .",
    "we should note that not all of the possible combinations of detrend variables were able to be selected as the increased freedom of floating central transit times and the detrending parameters resulted in many chains failing to meet the convergence criteria . to counteract this a gaussian prior",

    "we consider some metric involving @xmath67 minimization , but note that this assumes uncorrelated data which we know not to be the case .",
    "we understand that our data contain systematics , and detrending is one such effort to reduce the effects of these systematics .",
    "we also note that including all of the available parameters produces inferred values consistent with previous measurements , but this can vary at the @xmath138 level to the inferred value when detrend parameters are not used .",
    "we therefore conclude that detrended data inherently contain additional systematic uncertainties , typically not quoted , and detrending must be applied carefully in order to avoid biasing the inferred parameters . additionally readers should be cautious when trusting the inferred values of these parameters in this and other papers .",
