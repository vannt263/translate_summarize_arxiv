    "influenza epidemics are observed around the world during the wintertime and with a strong seasonal component in temperate regions @xcite@xcite .",
    "influenza is a disease caused by the influenza virus , an rna virus belonging to the orthomyxoviridae @xcite .",
    "many features are common with those of the paramyxovirus infections of the acute upper respiratory tract",
    ". typical symptoms of the disease are characterized by fever , myalgia , severe malaise , non - productive cough , and sore throats .",
    "the disease spreads when an infected individual coughs or sneezes and sends the virus into the air , and other susceptible individuals inhale the virus .",
    "the virus is also believed to be transmitted when a person touches a surface that is contaminated with the virus ( _ e.g. _ door knob , etc . ) and then touches the nose or eyes .",
    "infected individuals can transmit the virus almost within a day following infection ( _ i.e. _ latent period ) .",
    "although it is generally believed that infected individuals can pass the virus for 3 - 7 days following symptom onset , there is some uncertainty on the duration of the infectious period .",
    "the generation time ( _ i.e. _ sum of latent and infectious periods ) for influenza , reported and assumed in the literature , ranges from 3 days @xcite@xcite@xcite to about 6 days @xcite@xcite .",
    "individuals that are infected with influenza are believed to become permanently immune against the specific virus strain .",
    "hence , the virus is able to persist in the human population through relatively minor ( single point ) mutations in the virus composition known as drifts .",
    "influenza ( sub)types a / h3n2 , a / h1n1 and b are currently co - circulating in the human population @xcite .",
    "major changes in the virus composition via recombination or gene reassortment processes ( known as genetic shifts ) can lead to the emergence of novel influenza viruses with the potential of generating dramatic morbidity and mortality levels around the world @xcite .",
    "the 1918 - 19 influenza pandemic known as the * spanish influenza * caused by the influenza virus a ( h1n1 ) has been the most devastating in recent history with estimated worldwide mortality ranging from 20 to 100 million deaths @xcite@xcite with a case fatality of @xmath0-@xmath1 percent @xcite@xcite .",
    "the worldwide 1918 influenza pandemic spread in three waves starting from midwestern united states in the spring of 1918 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the deadly second wave began in late august probably in france while the third wave is generally considered as part of normal more scattered winter outbreaks similar to those observed after the 1889/90 pandemic @xcite .",
    "subsequent pandemics during the 20th century are attributed to subtyes a ( h2n2 ) from 1957 - 58 ( asian influenza ) and a ( h3n2 ) in 1968 ( hong kong influenza ) @xcite .",
    "the ability to quickly detect and institute control efforts at the early stage of an influenza pandemic is directly linked to the final levels of morbidity and mortality in the population @xcite . to appropriately assess the disaster size of a probable future pandemic",
    ", we have to quantify the transmission potential ( and its associated uncertainty ) .",
    "although it is difficult to directly measure the transmissibility of a future pandemic , historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics , and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning , mathematical and statistical analyses of the historical data can offer various insights .",
    "in particular , because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths ( _ i.e. _ epidemic curve ) , we modelers have faced with a difficult need to clarify the mechansms of the spread of influenza using such time - evolution data alone . in this paper",
    ", we review a number of mathematical and statistical methods for the estimation of the transmission potential of pandemic influenza , focusing on theoretical techniques to maximize the utility of the temporal distribution of influenza cases .",
    "the methods that have been incorporated in this review include the applications of epidemiologically structured epidemic models , explicitly duration - structured epidemic system , and stochastic processes ( _ i.e. _ branching and counting processes ) .",
    "whereas this review does not cover the spread of influenza in space , spatial heterogeneity in transmission and the growing interest in the role of contact network are briefly discussed as the future challenge .",
    "the basic reproduction number , @xmath2 ( pronounced as _ r nought _ ) , is a key quantity used to estimate transmissibility of infectious diseases .",
    "theoretically , @xmath2 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population @xcite .",
    "as the epidemic progresses , the number of susceptible individuals is decreased due to infection , and the reproduction number decays following @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the number of susceptible individuals at time @xmath6 and before the epidemic starts ; the latter is equivalent to the total population size @xmath7 given that all individuals are susceptible before the beginning of an epidemic .",
    "clearly , this definition only applies to ( novel ) emerging infectious diseases ( _ e.g. _ the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) from 2002 - 3 ) or re - emerging infectious diseases that had not circulated in the population in question for long enough to allow for residual immunity in the population to disappear due to births and deaths .",
    "+ the reproduction number is directly related to the type and intensity of interventions necessary to control an epidemic since the objective is to make @xmath8 as soon as possible . to achieve @xmath8 ,",
    "one or a combination of control strategies may be implemented .",
    "for example , one of the best known uses of @xmath2 is in determining the critical coverage of immunization required to eradicate a disease in a randomly mixing population .",
    "that is , when vaccine is available against a disease in question , it is of interest to estimate the critical proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated ( _ i.e. _ vaccination coverage ) in order to attain @xmath9 @xcite@xcite .",
    "for example , in the u.s prior to 1963 , a vaccine against measles was not available and hence recurrent epidemics of measles were observed with approximately @xmath10 million cases per year and a mean of @xmath11 deaths .",
    "the introduction of the vaccine in the u.s . reduced the incidence by 98 percent .",
    "+ the critical vaccination coverage , @xmath12 ( in a randomly mixing population ) can be estimated from the @xmath2 of the disease in question as follows @xcite : + @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the efficacy ( _ i.e. _ direct effectiveness ) of vaccination @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 given in ( [ eqn_intro1 ] ) suggests that the disease could be eradicated even when all susceptible individuals are not vaccinated .",
    "the protection conferred to the population by achieving a critical vaccination coverage is known as * herd immunity * @xcite@xcite . + a brief history of the theoretical developments on the basic reproduction number and its analytical computation via epidemic modeling is given elsewhere @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the mathematical definition and calculation of @xmath2 using next - generation arguments is described initially by odo diekmann and his colleagues @xcite@xcite , where @xmath2 is the dominant eigenvalue of the resulting next generation matrix .",
    "further elaborations and reviews can be found elsewhere @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "classically , rather than the threshold phenomena , @xmath2 was used to suggest the _ severity _ of an epidemic , because the proportion of those experiencing infection at the end of an epidemic depends only on @xmath2 @xcite ( see section 3 ) .",
    "+ statistical methods to quantitatively estimate @xmath2 have been reviewed by klaus dietz @xcite .",
    "depending on the characteristics of data and underlying assumptions of the models , @xmath2 can be estimated using various different approaches @xcite .",
    "in addition to the final size equation , @xmath2 of an epidemic of newly emerging disease can be estimated from the * intrinsic growth rate * @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , which is also referred to as the _ rate of natural increase _ , suggesting the natural growth rate of infected individuals in a fully susceptible population ( discussed in section 4 ) . moreover , for simple epidemic models with relatively few parameters , @xmath2 can be estimated with other unobservable quantities by rigorous curve fitting of model equations to the observed epidemic data ( discussed in section 3)@xcite@xcite@xcite . not only @xmath2 but also @xmath15 can be estimated from the temporal distribution of infectious diseases , reconstructing the transmission network or inferring the time - inhomogeneous number of secondary transmissions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "+ to estimate the basic reproduction number of endemic diseases , different approaches are taken .",
    "one would need first to carry out serological surveys to quantify the fraction of the population that is effectively protected against infection ( _ i.e. _ age- and/or time - specific proportion of those possessing acquired immunity needs to be estimated ) . through this effort ,",
    "the * force of infection * , the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected , is estimated @xcite .",
    "for example , this is the case for rubella , mumps and measles ( that are still circulating in some regions of the world even when high effective vaccination coverage is achieved ) .",
    "although the estimation of @xmath2 for endemic diseases is out of the scope of this review , methodological details and the applications to estimate the force of infection and @xmath2 can be found elsewhere @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "+ in practice , the reproduction number denoted simply by @xmath16 and defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a primary infectious cases in a partially protected population might be useful . @xmath16 can also be estimated from the initial growth phase of an epidemic in such a partially immunized population . in a randomly mixing population ,",
    "the relationship between the basic reproduction number ( @xmath2 ) and the reproduction number ( @xmath16 ) is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the proportion of the population that is effectively protected against infection ( in the beginning of an epidemic ) .",
    "besides , for many recurrent infectious diseases including seasonal influenza , estimating the background immunity @xmath18 in the population is extremely difficult due to cross - immunity of antigenically - related influenza strains and vaccination campaigns . + with reagard to seasonal influenza , the reproduction number ( @xmath16 ) over the last 3 decades has been estimated at @xmath19 ( se @xmath20 ) in the united states , france , and australia with an overall range of @xmath21 @xcite",
    ". an @xmath16 estimate of @xmath22 has been reported for a single a / h3n2 season in france @xcite , and some estimates have been reported in the range @xmath23-@xmath24 for several consecutive influenza seasons in england and wales @xcite@xcite .",
    "a particularly high estimate of @xmath16 has been suggested for the 1951 influenza epidemic in england and canada @xcite .",
    "+ because influenza pandemics such as the spanish flu from 1918 - 19 are associated to the emergence of novel influenza strains to which most of the population is susceptible , it might be reasonable to assume that the reproduction number @xmath25 .",
    "previous studies have estimated that @xmath2 of the 1918 - 19 influenza pandemic ranged between @xmath22 and @xmath26 @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite depending on the specific location and pandemic wave considered , type of data , estimation method , and level of spatial aggregation , which has ranged from small towns to entire nations with several million inhabitants .",
    "table [ tablewaves ] lists estimates of @xmath2 in recent studies .",
    "the variability of @xmath2 estimates suggests that local factors , including geographic and demographic conditions , could play an important role in disease spread @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the following sections , we review how these estimates are obtained and how we shall interpret the estimates , starting from a simple structured epidemic model proposed in 1927",
    "mathematical models provide a unique way to analyze the transmission dynamics and study various different scenarios associated to the spread of communicable diseases in population(s ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the history of the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases greatly remounts to the study of sir ronald ross in 1911 @xcite who invented a classic malaria model and also discovered the mosquito - borne transmission mechanisms of malaria . employing a mass action principle for the spread of malaria ,",
    "ross explored the effects of controling the mosquito population using simple mathematical models @xcite .",
    "following his effort , kermack and mckendrick introduced a classical sir ( susceptible - infectious - removed ) epidemic model in 1927 , which is most frequently utilized in the present day , given by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath4 denotes susceptible individuals at time @xmath6 ; @xmath28 , infected ( assumed infectious ) individuals at time @xmath6 ; and @xmath15 , recovered ( assumed permanently immune ) individuals at time @xmath6 ; @xmath29 is the transmission rate ; @xmath30 the recovery rate ; and @xmath7 is the total population size which is assumed constant for a closed population ( _ i.e. _ a population without immigration and emmigration ) .",
    "susceptible individuals in contact with the virus enter the infectious class ( @xmath31 ) at the rate @xmath32 .",
    "that is , homogeneous mixing between individuals is assumed . + the basic reproduction number , @xmath2 , for the epidemic system ( [ eq1 ] ) is given by the product of the transmission rate and the mean infectious period .",
    "that is : @xmath33 classically , @xmath2 has been known as a quantity to suggest * severity * of an epidemic @xcite .",
    "indeed , analytical expression of @xmath2 in ( [ eq_r0 ] ) is derived simply by solving the above system ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "replacing @xmath28 in the right hand side of @xmath34 by ( @xmath35)@xmath36 , we get @xmath37 integrating both sizes of ( [ fsize1 ] ) from 0 to infinity , @xmath38 since @xmath39 , and because we assume @xmath40 and @xmath41 , equation ( [ fsize2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath42 in the above equation ( [ fsize3 ] ) , * final size * , _ i.e. _ , the proportion of those experiencing infection among a total number of individuals in a community following a large scale epidemic , is defined as @xmath43 .",
    "that is , @xmath44 therefore , the following * final size equation * of an autonomous sir ( or seir ) model is obtained : @xmath45 equation ( [ fsize5 ] ) can be analytically derived using both deterministic ( models governed by odes or partial differential equations ( pdes))@xcite and stochastic models @xcite . despite the usefulness of ( [ eq1 ] ) , sir assumptions given by odes are not always directly applicable to real data .",
    "one of the reasons include that there is no disease where an infected individual can cause secondary transmission immediately after his / her infection",
    ". + accordingly , we have used slightly extended compartmental models in the previous studies to describe the transmission dynamics of the 1918 - 19 influenza pandemic and estimate the reproduction number @xcite@xcite .",
    "we now describe two different seir ( susceptible - exposed - infectious - removed ) models that have been used to estimate the reproduction number .",

    "what to be learnt from ( [ eqn_hn315 ] ) is , the assumption that _ secondary transmission happens immediately after onset _ suggests that the _ incubation period distribution is identical to the serial interval distribution _ as shown above , which is a bit funny conclusion . maximizing the utility of observed data has still remained an open question .",
    "+ in addition to modeling the temporal distribution , explicit modeling of asymptomatic infection is also called for @xcite .",
    "provided that there are so many asymptomatic transmissions which are not in the negligible order , we need to shift our concept of transmissibility ; _",
    "e.g. _ , rather than @xmath2 , a threshold quantity of symptomatic infection is required .",
    "in such a case , application of type - reproduction number @xmath235 might be useful @xcite@xcite , and it has already been put into practice @xcite .",
    "in this review , we focused on the use of the temporal distribution of influenza to estimate @xmath2 ( or @xmath15 ) and the relevant key parameters .",
    "it must be remembered that our arguments , almost necessarily , employed homogeneous mixing assumption , as we can not extract information on heterogeneous patterns of infection from a single stream of temporal data alone .",
    "presently , more information ( _ e.g. _ at least , spatio - temporal distribution ) is becoming available for influenza . in this section , we briefly sketch what can be ( and should be ) done in the future to quantify the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza .",
    "it s not a new issue that heterogeneous patterns of transmission could even destroy the mean field theory in infectious diseases .",
    "for example , in a pioneering study of gonorrhea transmission dynamics by hethcote and yorke @xcite , an importance of contact heterogeneity was sufficiently highlighted . since a simple model assuming",
    "homogeneous mixing did not reflect the patterns of gonorrhea transmission in the united states , hethcote and yorke divided the population in question into two ; those who are sexually very active and not , the former of which was referred to as * core * group .",
    "compared with the temporal distribution of infection given by a model with homogeneous mixing assumption , the simple heterogeneous model with a core group revealed much quicker increase in epidemic size , showing rather different trajectory of an epidemic .",
    "given that the variance of sexual partnership is extremely large ( _ i.e. _ if the distribution of the frequency of sexual intercourse is extremely skewed to the right with a very long right tail ) , the estimate of @xmath2 is shown to become considerably high .",
    "the finding supports a vulnerability of our society to the invasion of sexually transmitted diseases . following this pioneering study",
    ", considerable efforts have been made to approximately model the heterogeneous patterns of transmission using extended mean field equations @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . + in addition to such an approximation of heterogeneous transmission , recent progress in epidemic modeling with explicit contact network structures suggests that variance of the contact frequency plays a key role in determining the threshold quantity , and in some special cases , the concept of threshold phenomena could be confused @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in section 4",
    ", we defined the force of infection as @xmath281 in deteministic models given by simple odes ( which ignores infection - age ) , @xmath118 is equivalent to @xmath282 .",
    "these are what classical mean field models suggest .",
    "+ let us account for an epidemic on networks , whose node - connectivity distribution ( _ i.e. _ the distribution of probabilities that nodes have exactly @xmath48 neighbors ) follows some explicit distribution @xmath283 .",
    "the force of infection @xmath284 , which yields @xmath212 , in a static contact network is given by @xmath285 here @xmath286 denotes the average connectivity of the nodes . assuming that @xmath283 follows a power law of the form @xmath287 ( where @xmath288 is constant ) , @xmath289 given that @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and in such a case , @xmath2 even becomes infinite .",
    "this implies that the disease spread will continue for any mean estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "such a network structure is referred to as * scale free * @xcite , complicating disease control efforts in public health @xcite@xcite .",
    "the importance of the network structure would also be highlighted for @xmath292 .",
    "+ for sexually transmitted infections , contact frequency is countable ( unlike airborne infection or transmission through droplets ) , and @xmath293 is estimated to be around 3 or a little larger @xcite .",
    "following such a finding , many non - sexual directly transmitted diseases are also modeled in the present day assuming the scale - free network @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the pattern of contact does not necessarily follow scale - free for all directly transmitted diseases .",
    "indeed , there is no empirical evidence which suggests that the contact structure of any droplet infections follows the power law ( _ i.e. _ we do not know if the above described contact heterogeneity is the case for diseases except for sexually transmitted diseases ) .",
    "a typical example of confusion is seen in the superspreading events during the 2002 - 03 sars epidemics @xcite , where we can not explicitly attribute the phenomena either to contact network or biological factors ( as long as _ contact _ and infection event are not directly observable ) . we still do not know how we should account for the distribution @xmath283 for influenza and other viral respiratory diseases ( _ i.e. _ power law or not ) which remains to be clarified for each disease in future research .",
    "methodoligical developments have been made to account for the network heterogeneity with data @xcite .",
    "an approximate approach to address this issue is highlighted particularly in spatio - temporal modeling , an excellent account of which is reviewed by matt keeling @xcite . +",
    "even though it s difficult to quantify the transmission dynamics with an explicit contact network with time , there are useful analytical approximations to capture the dynamics of influenza ( and other respiratory transmitted viral diseases ) and estimate the transmission potential . for example",
    ", the force of infection with a power law approximation is reasonably given by : @xmath294 in ( [ eqn_hn404 ] ) , @xmath70 and @xmath295 characterize the epidemic dynamics ; _",
    "e.g. _ initial growth ( _ i.e _ if @xmath70 is less than 0 , the modified form acts to dampen the exponential growth of incidence ) and endemic equilibrium ( _ i.e. _ when @xmath295 is greater than 0 , density - dependent damping is increased ) . a model of this type",
    "was actually validated with measles data in england and wales , comparing the prediction with that of employing the mass action principle @xcite .",
    "+ another approximation might be a pair - wise model @xcite , which can explicitly account for the correlation between connected pairs .",
    "the model reasonably permits deriving the force of infection @xmath296 using the number of various connected paris , which implies wide applicability to the epidemiologic data of sexually transmitted infections . incorporating spatial heterogeneity in an approximate manner would shed light on further quantifications @xcite@xcite , and thus , simple and reasonably tractable models which permit spatio - temporal modeling of influenza are expected ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .      summarizing the above discussions , we have presented modeling approaches that can quantify the transmission potential of pandemic influenza .",
    "as we have shown , temporal case distributions have been analyzed in many instances , and previous efforts have come close to maximize the utility of temporal distributions ( _ i.e. _ epidemic curve ) .",
    "however , at the same time , we have also learned that we can extract almost the intrinsic growth rate alone from a single time - evolution data .",
    "accordingly , we are now faced with a need to clarify heterogeneous patterns of transmission and more detailed intrinsic dynamics of influenza @xcite@xcite@xcite . with regard to the latter , primitive epidemiologic questions (",
    "_ e.g. _ probability of clinical attack given infection ) remain to be answered for spanish , asian and hong kong influenza .",

    "for example , majority of the above listed issues could be reasonably addressed by implementing serological surveys ( _ e.g. _ antibody titers of individuals and , preferably , time - delay delay distribution from infection to seroconversion ) .",
    "since the proportion of those who do not experience symptomatic infection ( _ i.e. _ probability of asymptomatic infection ) is not small for influenza @xcite@xcite , case records can tell us little to address the above mentioned issues , and thus , historical data of spanish influenza may hardly offer further information . by maximizing the utility of observed data",
