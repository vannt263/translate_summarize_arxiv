    "interactions of very high energy neutrinos with nucleons as they traverse the earth are ideal probes of physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",

    "these neutrinos do not interact on their way to the earth , and they arrive undeflected by magnetic fields .",
    "once they reach the earth , they interact with nucleons in the earth , or possibly in the atmosphere . in some supersymmetric models , neutrino interactions in earth",
    "could produce heavy supersymmetric particles that decay into quasi - stable sleptons .    in the weak scale supersymmetric models with the supersymmetry breaking scale larger than @xmath1 gev ,",

    ", staus may travel thousands of kilometers through the earth without decaying .",
    "recently it was proposed that a direct way of probing the susy breaking scale in weak scale supersymmetry models would be to detect pairs of charged tracks in neutrino detectors , such as icecube , from staus resulting from neutrino - nucleon interactions producing heavier supersymmetric particles @xcite .",
    "this has been further explored in refs . @xcite and @xcite .    because of the small cross section , the production of staus from downward neutrinos is negligible in comparison with the background from the standard model processes",
    ". however , upward neutrinos producing staus could potentially be detectable because of the effective detector volume that is enlarged by the long range of the stau .",
    "detection of staus produced in neutrino - nucleon interactions in earth depends strongly on the stau lifetime and range .",
    "thus it is crucial to determine the energy loss and effective range of the high energy stau as it traverses the earth .",
    "the average electromagnetic energy loss of a particle which traverses a distance @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lepton energy , @xmath5 represents the ionization energy loss , and @xmath6 is the radiative energy loss .",
    "to first approximation , @xmath6 scales inversely with stau mass .    in ref .",

    "interaction lengths from charged current weak interactions are of the same order of magnitude . in this paper , we evaluate the energy and mass dependence of the stau weak interaction energy loss and attenuation , and we show its relevance to the stau range .",
    "weak interaction cross sections , because of the massive vector boson propagators , have a different mass dependence than the electromagnetic energy loss parameter @xmath6 .",
    "depending on the details of the supersymmetric couplings , we find that weak effects may dominate the stau range .    in sec .",

    "the ionization energy loss parameter @xmath5 is nearly constant as a function of mass of the particle , namely @xcite @xmath19 at energies above @xmath20 gev , energy loss of leptons and staus is dominated by the electromagnetic radiative processes . for staus , weak interactions may also become important .",

    "for the sneutrino mass between 5 gev and 150 gev more than the stau mass , the cross section changes by a factor of @xmath72 . in the following ,",
    "we show only a 50 gev mass difference .",
    "comparing the scales associated with weak interaction and electromagnetic processes shows that the charged - current interactions become significant at higher energies , in contrast to the neutral current interactions . for a stau mass of @xmath48 gev and @xmath32 ,",
    "this corresponds to energies higher than about @xmath73 gev .",
    "for the lighter @xmath47 gev stau mass , the charged current process does not contribute significantly for energies up to @xmath10 gev .",
    "the opportunity for charged current interactions to become relevant comes from the fact that the charged current cross section is less sensitive to the stau mass than the photonuclear energy loss parameter @xmath6 .    a comparison of figs . 5 and 3 verifies our assertion that the weak neutral current contribution to @xmath6 for staus is not important .",
    "this is also true for tau energy loss .",
    "[ fig : s150dist ]    because @xmath74 for staus , taus and muons , we neglect neutral current interactions in our evaluation of the range . for staus ,",

    "the curves are evaluated for @xmath81 gev and the decay parameter @xmath82 gev , where the lifetime is determined by @xmath83 the lifetime is not relevant for this energy range for @xmath81 gev and @xmath82 gev : @xmath84 kmwe for @xmath51 gev . a distance which is relevant , which also grows with energy , depends on the ionization energy loss parameter @xmath5 through @xmath85 , shown in the figure .",
    "we also show the charged current interaction length @xmath86 and the distance characterized by @xmath87 , the electromagnetic energy loss parameter .",
    "we show the range for 150 gev staus with no charged current contributions ( @xmath30 ) and with maximal charged current contributions ( @xmath32 ) . at low energies , the ionization energy loss dominates , but for @xmath88 gev , the charged current interaction dominates the evaluation of the range if @xmath32 .",
    "the range does not precisely equal the charged current interaction length because the electromagnetic energy loss is still a factor , shifting the initial stau energy to lower energies .",
    "7 shows the stau ranges in rock for @xmath81 and 250 gev , again for minimum stau energy of @xmath89 gev and @xmath82 gev .",
    "the upper curves show the range when charged current interactions are vanishing , while the lower curves have maximal charged current interactions .    finally , in fig .",
    "8 we show the characteristic distances for taus in rock and the tau range .",
    "the lifetime governs the range at low energies , while electromagnetic energy loss dominates at high energies . because the charged current interaction length is small compared to @xmath90 , the tau range changes very little with charged current interactions included .",
    "we do not find a decrease in the range in rock or water near @xmath91 gev as suggested in ref .",
    "this is due to the fact that using just the scales , e.g. , @xmath92 or the cc interaction length , is insufficient to accurately compute the range .",
    "we have directly evaluated the tau range via eq .",
    "( 16 ) , where the probability includes stochastic effects in the tau propagation .",
    "we have shown that weak interactions have the potential to play an important role in stau detection by neutrino telescopes , however , the effect is strongly energy dependent .",
    "our results are based on a sneutrino mass 50 gev more massive than the stau , and we considered @xmath32 .    recent work on stau signals",
    "@xcite has focused on the icecube detector .",
    "the stau pair event rate depends on the effective volume for creation of a pair of staus .",
    "the effective volume scales approximately with the stau range which depends on energy .    refs .",
    "@xcite show that the signal events come from energies fairly near the threshold for squark production because of the falling neutrino fluxes . in these studies ,",
    "an incident @xmath93 neutrino flux is assumed .",
    "the threshold depends on squark masses : for @xmath94 gev , the energy threshold is between a few@xmath95 gev . for @xmath51 gev , even a maximal charged current cross sections with @xmath96 gev does nt affect the stau energy range dramatically . for @xmath81 gev , maximal cc interactions reduce the range by 22% at @xmath20 gev , and by 31% at @xmath97 gev .",
    "the effect is less pronounced for @xmath98 gev . when @xmath99 for @xmath98 gev and @xmath82 gev , the range is reduced by 9% and 21% for @xmath51 and @xmath97 gev , respectively .",
    "based on these reductions in the range , the thresholds in the @xmath100 gev energy range and steeply falling fluxes , event rate estimates without including weak interactions are reasonably reliable .",
    "efforts to try to detect staus with higher energy thresholds are potentially strongly influenced by charged current interactions , where the range can be as much as two orders of magnitude shorter than the range evaluated without charged current interactions .",
    "a detector such as the antarctic impulse transient array ( anita ) @xcite is sensitive to stau energies larger than @xmath101 gev .",
    "designed to use a radio antenna suspended by a balloon @xmath102 km over the south pole ice , the primary goal of the experiment is to detect cosmogenic neutrinos incident just below the horizon which interact with the ice .",
    "the goal is to detect the radio cherenkov signal produced by neutrino weak interactions which refracts on its way out of the ice .",
    "staus would also make a signal by weakly interacting in the ice .",
    "weak interactions play a role for anita signals in two ways . as noted above",
    ", the most important feature of weak interactions is to produce the signal itself . for electromagnetic interactions ,",
    "only a small amount of energy will be deposited in the shower over the area of @xmath103 km@xmath104 .",
    "neutral current interactions have a larger energy deposition necessary for detection .",
    "charged current interactions have the largest energy deposition .",
    "only neutral current processes will contribute to the signal if @xmath30 , while charged current processes contribute with increasing values of @xmath58 .",
    "the maximum contribution from charged current interactions occur when @xmath32 . for this maximum value of the mixing angle , @xmath105 , meaning that the probability for interactions of staus in the ice is increased by a factor of 10 over the case of @xmath30 .",
    "a second effect for anita signals is that charged current weak interactions may attenuate the stau flux in transit to the ice in view of the detector . by incorporating the attenuation of the gzk neutrino flux @xcite as it traverses the earth , the stau production cross section @xcite and the stau interactions on the way to the detector , we find that the stau flux attenuation at @xmath106 gev ranges from 1 at @xmath107 to @xmath108 at a @xmath109 angle measured relative to the horizon @xcite . for energies of @xmath110 gev",
    ", attenuation causes the stau flux to be lowered by a factor of @xmath111 with maximal charged current interactions for an angle of @xmath109 below the horizon .",
    "the factor of 10 increase in the signal due to the stau cc interactions in ice is sufficient to compensate for the attenuation as well as enhance the signal when the full range of energy is considered .    to summarize , weak interaction effects are small in the range of energies relevant to the icecube detector .",
    "recent event rate estimates @xcite for icecube will be reduced by less than @xmath112 for @xmath113 gev by including maximal weak interactions . the potential for observing staus at higher energies , for example , by the anita detector ,",
    "is enhanced by maximal weak interactions .",
    "the enhancement is due to the high energy charged current cross section which becomes increasingly important as the stau energy increases above @xmath114 gev . a detailed investigation of the anita signal from stau pairs , and for the proposed arianna @xcite telescope is in progress @xcite .",
    "signals of staus from several energy regimes may impose constraints on this class of supersymmetry models with quasi - stable staus in the future .",
    "we thank john beacom for inspiring us to look at weak interaction stau energy loss and for many useful discussions .",
