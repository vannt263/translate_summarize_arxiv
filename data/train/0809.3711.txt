    "a real - valued signal @xmath0 is said to be band - limited if its fourier transform , usually denoted by @xmath1 , has compact support .",
    "this constitutes a broad class of signals sometimes referred to as the _ paley - wiener space _ being of paramount importance in the applications as most of human and natural phenomena should exclude infinite frequencies .",
    "the classical paley - wiener theorem states that any band - limited signal with finite energy ( _ i.e. _ such that @xmath2 is finite ) is indeed the restriction of an entire function of exponential type defined in the whole complex plane @xcite .",
    "consequently , it would suffice to know a small part of such a signal in order to be able to extend it arbitrarily to any open set of the complex plane .",
    "however , this is unrealistic at the time being ( even if some progress has been made recently , see for instance @xcite and references therein ) and in practice , one has still to focus on their analysis .",
    "as the fourier transform is supposed to be of compact support , it may seem a good idea to express numerically band - limited signals relying of optimized algorithms like the well - known _ fast fourier transform _ ( fft ) . especially , shannon s sampling theorem ensures that all the signal s information can be recovered from the knowledge of a countable collection of samples .",
    "however , we shall explain in  2.2 that this idea does nt lead to economical ( so  called _ sparse _ ) representations ( consult especially @xcite in this direction ) .",
    "an alternative can come from the decomposition into _ chirps _ which read like @xmath3 ; the term _ chirplets _ has been coined by steve mann @xcite in an attempt to derive an object more sophisticated than wavelets .",
    "briefly , if fourier transform gives a full resolution of frequencies but a null time - resolution , wavelets offer a good compromise according to the uncertainty principle but still decompose signals onto horizontal rectangles in the time - frequency plane @xcite . as chirps are endowed with a time - varying phase function @xmath4 , decomposing a signal into a superposition of chirps means that time - frequency _ curves _ are now involved .",
    "the most usual chirps are the gaussian / quadratic ones , for which both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are polynomials of degree 2 : we shall work in this framework hereafter .    clearly ,",
    "since chirps are more complex objects , they need more parameters to be defined correctly .",
    "indeed , one can roughly count that 6 parameters are needed for the definition of both functions , plus 2 other parameters dealing with the time and the mean frequency around which the chirp is localized .",
    "all in all , we found at the end of  2.3 that a signal being written as the sum of @xmath7 chirps requires at most @xmath8 parameters to evaluate . in many cases",
    ", this constitutes a great improvement with respect to classical fourier techniques .",
    "the main drawback in the setup of chirp decomposition techniques is the weight of the computational effort required : according to the literature , most of the algorithms rely on matching pursuit techniques @xcite where one first considers a rather complete dictionary of chirps in order to find iteratively the ones matching the signal as best as possible ( see @xcite and the recent paper @xcite motivated by gravitational waves detection ) .",
    "however , in a very recent paper , greenberg and co - authors @xcite proposed a completely different approach where one gets rid of the dictionary and constructs the chirp approximation by means of a simple and easy - to - implement procedure . loosely speaking , given a complex signal in polar form @xmath9 , it amounts to seek local maxima of @xmath10 ( we call them for instance @xmath11 ) and approximate both @xmath12 and @xmath13 by polynomials of degree 2 admitting an extremum around @xmath11 .",
    "the procedure is first applied to @xmath14 , the first maximum point of @xmath10 , in order to derive 2 polynomials @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and then it applies to the remaining signal @xmath17 until residues become low enough . in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a more elaborate algorithm than the one contained inside @xcite ; it will be presented in detail within  3 .",
    "first ,  3.1 will deal with a pointwise selection procedure to compute chirps parameters .",
    "then in  3.2 , a mean squares @xmath18 procedure will be proposed .",
    "both approaches will be tested on an academic example in  4 which presents a numerical validation of these algorithms .",
    "we insist on the fact that the approach is numerically efficient and computationally cheap .",
    "finally ,  5 will be devoted to more  real - life \" experiments : trying to decompose a signal slightly corrupted by white noise and seeking a chirp inside a stock market index .",
    "our interest lies in an efficient , approximate representation of real - valued , band - limited signals @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 is such a time - dependent signal , it may be written in a very general way as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the unit of the imaginary axis , @xmath23 stands from now on for the fourier dual variable and the function @xmath24 rewrites like :    @xmath25    the corresponding even and odd components of @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are smooth real - valued functions satisfying    @xmath28    by definition of band - limited , both @xmath29 and @xmath30 vanish identically outside of the interval @xmath31 ; moreover , they are assumed to satisfy    @xmath32    the symmetries of @xmath26 and @xmath27 imply that    @xmath33    which is a well - known property of the fourier transform for real signals ( the overbar stands hereafter for complex conjugate ) .",
    "the function @xmath34 can be recovered from the signal via the classical fourier transform :    @xmath35",
    "this last identify further implies that for all @xmath23 ,    @xmath36    hold for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the even / odd parts of the signal @xmath39 defined for all @xmath40 as follows :    @xmath41    we regard ( [ e1.6])([e1.8 ] ) as a sanity check on how well we are doing in synthesizing @xmath20 from @xmath42 ; that is if we employ some algorithm to compute ( [ e1.1 ] ) , approximately , we then use that computed @xmath20 to approximately evaluate ( [ e1.5 ] ) and see how well the result agrees with the original function @xmath34 .",
    "standard representations of band - limited signals may be obtained by discretizing the integral defined in ( [ e1.1 ] ) .",
    "if we introduce a discrete ( and finite ) set of frequencies @xmath43    @xmath44    and exploit ( [ e1.4 ] ) , we find that the trapezoidal rule , applied to ( [ e1.1 ] ) , yields the approximate band - limited function , @xmath45 , whose value reads    @xmath46    the function is real - valued and satisfies @xmath47 provided the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath48 on @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath45 is periodic with period , @xmath50 , and is completely determined by its values at times @xmath51 ( this is the classical shannon sampling theorem ) . to see this",
    "we note that    @xmath52    which yields    @xmath53    now , one observes the following property of the exponentials :    @xmath54    the identities ( [ e1.12])([e1.14 ] ) imply that for @xmath55    @xmath56    while for @xmath57 , they yield :    @xmath58    this identity ( [ e1.16 ] ) shows that if we extend ( [ e1.15 ] ) to the indices @xmath59 , then the extension is consistent with the constraint ( [ e1.4 ] ) .",
    "this last set of identities give an alternative means of computing @xmath34 at the lattice points @xmath60 . for completeness",
    ", we record relevant identities for the coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "they are :    @xmath63    @xmath64    where    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    the @xmath67 periodicity of @xmath45 guarantees that @xmath68 and that @xmath69 . moreover ,",
    "if we extend ( [ e1.17 ] ) to @xmath70 , then ( [ e1.16 ] ) guarantees that the extension is consistent with ( [ e1.4])@xmath71 .",
    "similarly , if we extend ( [ e1.18 ] ) to @xmath70 , we find the extension is also consistent with ( [ e1.4 ] ) .",
    "the standard approach outlined above will , in the limit as @xmath72 , yield the desired signal @xmath20 but is computationally intensive and requires a significant amount of data .",
    "our goal here is a more economical approximate representation of @xmath20 which , in many circumstances , requires substantially less data .",
    "we first note that if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are defined as in  2.1 and satisfy ( [ e1.4 ] ) , then @xmath34 can be written in polar form ( at least at points where it does nt vanish ) :    @xmath73    where the  amplitude \" is real , nonnegative and satisfies :    @xmath74    furthermore , @xmath75 is identically zero on @xmath76 and satisfies @xmath77 .",
    "the  phase \" @xmath78 is a smooth , odd function satisfying    @xmath79    as our * canonical model * for @xmath80 we assume that it has exactly @xmath81 local maxima at the following distinct points ,    @xmath82    and that each of these maxima is non - degenerate ; i.e. @xmath83 . the fact that @xmath84 guarantees that @xmath80 also has non - degenerate local maxima located at the symmetric set of points :    @xmath85    the origin , @xmath86 , will be either a local maximum or a local minimum of @xmath80 . in the former case",
    "we shall assume that @xmath87 .",
    "given the structural properties of the amplitude @xmath80 we attempt to approximate it by means of functions @xmath88 of the following gaussian form : @xmath89    where @xmath90 , and    @xmath91    when @xmath92 corresponds to a minimum of @xmath80 we choose @xmath93 .",
    "approximate @xmath80 s of the form ( [ e1.26 ] ) are not band limited but they have tails which decay rapidly as @xmath94 and this is adequate for our purposes .",
    "in  [ param esti ] we present two algorithms for choosing the parameters @xmath90 , and the numbers @xmath43 s and show how these selection procedures perform on various examples . for the time",
    "being , we assume the relevant parameters are known and instead of working with @xmath95 , we replace it with    @xmath96    using this approximation to @xmath34 we arrive at the following approximation for the signal defined by ( [ e1.1 ] ) :    @xmath97    to carry this process further , we replace the terms @xmath98 in ( [ e1.29 ] ) by their local quadratic taylor approximations around @xmath99 .",
    "the result is @xmath100 hence @xmath101    we note that this last step is equivalent to replacing @xmath102 with    @xmath103    and computing ( [ e1.1 ] ) with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "the function @xmath104 satisfies @xmath105 as required by ( [ e1.5 ] ) of @xmath34 .",
    "the reader will note that @xmath104 is merely the sum of @xmath106 complex _ gaussian ( or quadratic ) chirps_. exploiting the quadratic approximations defined in ( [ e1.30 ] ) when evaluating ( [ e1.29 ] ) yields , after a tedious calculation , the approximation @xmath107 to @xmath20 :    @xmath108    where    @xmath109    or equivalently    @xmath110    the aforementioned approximation @xmath107 is simply the sum of @xmath7 real gaussian chirps which are characterized by @xmath8 parameters    * @xmath111 , * @xmath112 , for @xmath113 .    finally , @xmath114 is computed using ( [ e1.38 ] ) .",
    "approximations of band - limited signals by real - valued gaussian chirps of the type described in ( [ e1.36 ] ) offers efficient representation of radar , seismic , and some biological signals .",
    "a sampling of the literature on this subject may be found in @xcite and the references contained therein .",
    "the central problem in establishing such a formula is an efficient and natural method for obtaining the parameters characterizing the chirps .",
    "the  matching - pursuit \" and  ridge - pursuit \" algorithms have been used by a number of authors ; for details see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "these typically require complicated multi - dimensional searches to obtain the chirp parameters and they also demand complete a - priori dictionary of chirps .",
    "the procedures we advance in  [ param esti ] to capture the parameters @xmath115 require no such complete dictionary and rely only on information about the signal amplitude @xmath80 .",
    "the remaining chirp parameters @xmath116 are obtained from local information about the phase , @xmath117 , near the points @xmath43 .",
    "the algorithms are also hierarchical and give our approximations a multi - resolution character .",
    "less refined versions of these procedures were advanced in @xcite .",
    "in this section we present two different algorithms for the selection of the parameters defining @xmath88 , recall ( [ e1.26 ] ) . for definiteness , we assume @xmath92 is a local minimum of @xmath80 and thus choose @xmath93 .      we attempt to choose the parameters so that at the positive local maxima , @xmath118 , one gets : @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "hereafter , we denote by @xmath121 the gaussian function centered in @xmath122 :    @xmath123    then , its first derivative reads    @xmath124    and its second derivative is    @xmath125    hence , for @xmath120 , the set of equations ( 3.1)@xmath126 rewrites as @xmath127 which boils down to : @xmath128 we differentiate this equality once , @xmath129 and twice : @xmath130 we have in mind to propose an iterative algorithm to compute a solution to the above system of 3 equations in order to get the value of the 3 parameters ; the index @xmath131 will refer to the successive approximations built out of this iterative process .    * for the first index @xmath132 , we let @xmath133 * we now suppose the coefficients @xmath134 are known ; we want to compute these parameters at step @xmath135 . for the first index @xmath136 ,",
    "we let + @xmath137 + if @xmath138 and @xmath139 , then we can compute an auxiliary quantity : + @xmath140 + and @xmath141 , and @xmath142 are deduced as follows : + @xmath143 * we now assume we have determined @xmath144 for indices @xmath145 .",

    "this way of proceeding is related to standard iterative methods in numerical linear algebra , like for instance jacobi or gauss - seidel .",
    "we note that with this method of parameter selection , the following estimate holds : @xmath158 in a neighborhood of each of the local maxima , @xmath159 , of @xmath80 .",
    "this pointwise selection procedure generalizes the procedure used in @xcite and captures the behavior of @xmath80 near all maxima simultaneously .",

    "we also adopt the short - hand notation    @xmath162    and note , for future reference , that for all @xmath163 and @xmath164 :    @xmath165    a quick calculation shows that @xmath166 is given by    @xmath167    where the value of @xmath168 has been given above and    @xmath169    for a given choice of parameters @xmath170 the @xmath171 s which minimize ( [ e2.27 ] ) satisfy    @xmath172    where @xmath173 is the symmetric , positive - definite , @xmath174 matrix whose @xmath175 entry reads :    @xmath176    @xmath171 is the @xmath177 column vector whose @xmath178 entry is @xmath179 and @xmath180 is the @xmath177 column vector whose @xmath178 entry is @xmath181 .",
    "the solution to ( [ e2.29 ] ) is given by @xmath182 , and this implies :    @xmath183    thus , the task before us is to choose @xmath170 to maximize @xmath184 where again @xmath185 is the symmetric , positive - definite inverse of @xmath173 defined in ( [ e2.30 ] ) above . at first blush",
    ", the problem of maximizing @xmath186 looks rather daunting but , in fact , this problem has a rather simple structure .    * for any integer @xmath187 between 1 and @xmath81 we let @xmath188 be one of the two parameters @xmath43 or @xmath189 and we observe that : + @xmath190 + noting that @xmath191 and that @xmath192 is the @xmath193 column vector whose @xmath194 component is @xmath195 and other components zero , we see that the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ e2.33 ] ) is @xmath196 . moreover , if we exploit the identity , + @xmath197 + we find that the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ e2.33 ] ) is @xmath198 and again the @xmath171 s are the solution of ( [ e2.29 ] ) .",

    "the recovery of the amplitude ( [ lolo ] ) by means of two gaussians looks very satisfying and errors are noticeable only in the last example where the original signal is corrupted by _ white noise _ ; the cubic phase ( fig .

    "this is the data we furnish to the algorithm of  3.1 . obviously , the white noise has to remain small in order not to perturb the maxima of @xmath224 .",
    "what we found is that even this requirement is nt enough as the phase function should not be corrupted too much in order to let the algorithm approximate it locally by a parabola correctly . in this case , the absolute recovery error is bigger compared to the noise - free case ( see again fig .",

    "<S> in this paper we present algorithms for approximating real band - limited signals by multiple gaussian chirps . </S>",
    "<S> these algorithms do not rely on matching pursuit ideas . </S>",
    "<S> they are hierarchial and , at each stage , the number of terms in a given approximation depends only on the number of positive - valued maxima and negative - valued minima of a signed amplitude function characterizing part of the signal . like </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms used in @xcite and unlike previous methods , our chirplet approximations require neither a complete dictionary of chirps nor complicated multi - dimensional searches to obtain suitable choices of chirp parameters . </S>"
