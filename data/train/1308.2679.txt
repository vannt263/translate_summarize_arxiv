    "the largest mass component of the universe is a longstanding mystery to the physics community .",
    "dark matter has been probed using particle colliders , direct detection experiments , and indirect detection in telescopes . despite these intensive searches",
    "it has proven elusive .",
    "it is clear we must be thorough and creative as we continue the important mission to search for it .    from a particle physics perspective , it is essential to have a theoretical description of dark matter .",
    "such a description allows one to contrast various searches @xcite , and fit the dark matter into the broader context of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "there are two common approaches to dark matter model building .",
    "the first is to find a complete theory ( which typically addresses some other problem such as the gauge hierarchy ) , and also contains a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "the prototypical example of this approach is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "one can work with the complete theory with every detail included .",
    "often there are many free parameters , which on the one hand leads to a rich range of phenomena , but on the other makes it difficult to draw general conclusions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative is to look at simplified models @xcite where only the particles and parameters most relevant to the search are included .",
    "the simplified model can be understood as a phenomenological sketch of a complete model ; for example , in the mssm this might include only looking at the two lightest supersymmetric particles .",
    "the most model - independent theory of dark matter is to adopt an effective field theory ( eft ) which includes only the sm plus the dark matter itself as states in the theory .",
    "this approach has led to a fruitful program , in which one enumerates the possible operators describing dark matter interaction and places bounds on each of them ( or in combination ) from the null results of collider @xcite and/or astro - particle @xcite searches .",
    "this method s greatest power is that it is very generic .",
    "however it suffers from its uv incompleteness and breaks down at energies comparable to the mass of the underlying mediator particle , which can call its applicability into question , particularly at high energy colliders .",
    "the strategy which we employ in this paper attempts to mediate these issues .",
    "a uv complete theory can be formed which is not necessarily a simplification of a particular complete theory , but instead captures features of classes of models .",
    "the simplified models we construct are broad enough to capture features of a certain class of models , while remaining valid at higher energies .",
    "thus , it facilitates relating processes at varying energies , in particular results from collider and direct detection experiments .",
    "specifically , we will examine models involving fermionic dark matter and scalar mediators .",
    "for other constructions in similar directions , see refs .",
    "our simplified models contain a fermionic dark matter particle denoted by @xmath0 , which is a sm singlet and can be either a dirac or a majorana fermion .",
    "in addition , our theory contains scalar mediator particles which interact with the dark matter and sm quarks .",
    "given our choice of dark matter which is a sm singlet , this leads to three choices for gauge representations of the mediators under the sm @xmath1 : @xmath2 we refer to these three choices as the @xmath3 model ( with mediators labeled as @xmath4 ) , the @xmath5 model ( with mediators @xmath6 ) , and the @xmath7 model ( with mediators @xmath8 ) . for each model ,",
    "the lagangrian density consists of kinetic terms for @xmath0 and the scalar mediators ( including their gauge interactions ) , and a trilinear interaction between @xmath0 , the scalar mediator , and the corresponding sm quark .",
    "for example , in the @xmath3 model with dirac dm the lagrangian density is : @xmath9 where ,",
    "@xmath10 such that @xmath11 defines the appropriate covariant derivative for the scalars , @xmath12 is the flavor vector of up - type quarks , and @xmath4 a flavor vector of scalars .",
    "similar actions may be simply written down for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 models , and the kinetic terms for @xmath0 may be appropriately modified for the majorana cases .",
    "each of our models is constructed with three scalar mediators , in order to implement minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) @xcite , with the mediators transforming as triplets under the appropriate factors of the flavor group .",
    "this insures that in moving from the gauge to mass basis , the deviations from flavor - universality will be proportional to sm yukawa interactions , and thus small for the first two generations .",
    "in particular , this implies that the leading term ( in an expansion in the sm yukawa matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) @xmath15 will be equal for all flavors , and that the masses @xmath16 will be degenerate",
    ". we can further rephase @xmath0 such that @xmath15 is a real parameter .    while we will not move beyond these leading terms in our analysis",
    ", one can easily determine the next terms one would find ( continuing to illustrate with the @xmath3 model ) : @xmath17 the effect of non - zero @xmath18 and/or @xmath19 would be to split apart the couplings and masses of the third generation mediators apart from the still largely degenerate first and second generations .",
    "we defer consideration of non - zero @xmath18 and @xmath19 to future work .",
    "we derive bounds from cms results which studied the simplfied model t2 @xcite , which assumes that the dominant production mode produces two squark - like objects each of which subsequently decays into a jet and a neutralino .",
    "they place an upper limit on the production cross section of that process as a function of the masses of the squark and neutralino . for our corresponding process ,",
    "two scalars are produced and , similarly , each decay into a jet and dark matter particle .",
    "the cms study was conducted at @xmath20 tev with 11.7 fb@xmath21 of data .",
    "the selection for this study requires 2 - 4 jets with @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 , where the two most energetic jets have @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 .",
    "events with an isolated electron or muon with @xmath26 gev and events with an isolated photon with @xmath27 gev are vetoed .",
    "events are also required to have @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 .",
    "see @xcite for more detailed information .",
    "we simulate production cross sections ( including the decays ) with used madgraph 1.5.9 @xcite with model files implemented in feynrules 1.7 @xcite .",
    "we simulate at @xmath20 tev and using the cteq6l pdf set .",
    "we have verified that we can reproduce the cms limits for qcd production of light squarks , up to the fact that cms uses nlo cross sections from prospino @xcite whereas we use leading order cross sections .",
    "to convert cross section limits into limits on our parameter , @xmath30 , we use a bisection method , choosing the interval @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "larger values correspond to non - perturbative coupling , which would call into question the validity of the simplified model as an effective field theory .",
    "we leave for future work consideration of other processes , such as the mono - jet process , @xmath33 and associated production such as @xmath34 .",
    "these processes lead to a distinct signature and may help fill in the regime where the dark matter and the mediator are quasi - degenerate in mass , but otherwise tend to provide weaker bounds than mediator pair production for @xmath35 .",
    "it would be worthwhile to include these processes in a full collider analysis .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 model could lead to leptonic signals due to transitions between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 states resulting in @xmath38 bosons , once one includes the mass splitting effects from the terms analogous to equation  ( [ eq : lfv ] ) .",
    "the derived limits are shown for all three dirac models in figure  [ fig : cms ] and for the majorana models in figure  [ fig : cmsmaj ] . in both figures ,",
    "the white regions correspond to regions not considered by cms , because the mediator and dark matter are too degenerate in mass to efficiently pass the analysis cuts ( and in addition , much of this parameter space is theoretically inaccessible because the scalar mediators are lighter than the @xmath0 ) , whereas the black regions are simply excluded by the cms bounds for all values of @xmath30 .",
    "the excluded regions are largely similar for both the majorana and dirac cases , where the limit is driven by gluon fusion into a scalar mediator and its anti - particle . however , in some regions the bounds are stronger for majorana dark matter , which has the additional production process of two scalar mediators from a @xmath39 initial state by exchanging the majorana @xmath0 in the @xmath40-channel .    0.48   for each of the three simplified models with dirac dark matter , from the cms collider bounds .",

    "the two remaining terms result in spin - independent and spin - dependent scattering , respectively . in the @xmath3 model , this results in cross sections for si and sd scattering with a nucleon : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 specifies the nucleon of interest and the structure functions @xmath48 can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "note that this theory has different si cross sections for protons and neutrons .    a similar calculation for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 dirac models yields : @xmath49 and likewise the cross sections for majorana dm are also computed for each model : @xmath50 note that since a majorana fermion has a vanishing vector bilinear , there are only spin - dependent cross - sections for the majorana dm cases .    for dirac dark matter , this class of simplified models results in roughly comparable spin - independent and dependent cross sections .",
    "since the si bounds at a given dark matter mass are currently much lower than the corresponding sd ones , they dominate the constraints .",
    "we translate the limits from xenon100 @xcite and xenon10 @xcite into bounds on @xmath30 at every point in the plane of the dark matter and mediator masses . for majorana dark matter ,",
    "the dominant constraint is from the sd interaction , with the best experimental limits for neutrons and protons arising from xenon100 @xcite and picasso @xcite , respectively .",
    "it turned out in all cases that the picasso limit was weaker than the cms limit corresponding to that point of parameter space .    applying these limits ,",
    "the results for dirac dark matter are shown in figure  [ fig : xe100 ] ( with a zoomed in view of the small dark matter mass region in figure  [ fig : xe10 ] from xenon10 limits ) , and for majorana dark matter in [ fig : sdxe ] . in these plots ,",
    "the white regions indicate theoretically inaccessible regions with colored mediators lighter than the dark matter itself . for large @xmath51",
    ", the xenon limits are slowly varying and nearly linear . in this regime ,",
    "the elastic scattering cross section is approximately independent of @xmath51 and we observe the expected behavior where the curves of constant @xmath30 go like @xmath52 , similar to the dependence of the direct detection cross section on the two masses . for @xmath53  gev ,",
    "the limit on @xmath30 from xenon weakens very rapidly as the experiments approach their threshold for observable scattering . in turn , this allows @xmath30 to be much larger as @xmath51 decreases .",
    "this feature is illustrated in [ fig : xe10 ] where we have zoomed into a much smaller scale of @xmath51 to more clearly show the behavior in this regime .",

    "we determine combined limits by first applying the cms bounds , and overlaying those from direct detection , replacing the existing limit on @xmath30 only when the direct detection limit is stronger than the collider one .",
    "the resulting limits are shown in figure  [ fig : dbound ] for dirac dark matter , and in figure  [ fig : mbound ] for majorana dark matter .",
    "generically , the most tightly bounded case is the @xmath7 model , due to its larger number of colored states which can either be produced at the collider or mediate elastic scattering .",
    "however , the contribution to the sd elastic scattering in the majorana model exhibits destructive interference between up - quarks and down - quarks , which allows for weaker constraints in that case .",

    "in addition to the well - known cases where colliders dominate direct detection bounds for very light dark matter and/or dark matter with predominantly spin - dependent interactions , we also see a different kind of complementarity .",
    "because colliders can access the mediators directly through qcd production , they can rule out cases where the mediator mass is light enough . instead",
    ", direct detection can not rule out a model , but generically places the strongest limits on @xmath30 for dirac dark matter which has si interactions . for the majorana cases , the sd limits are typically weak enough so as to be subdominant to the collider bounds , except for very degenerate spectra .",
    "based on the combined bounds of figures  [ fig : dbound ] and [ fig : mbound ] , we can make forecasts for what other types of experiments might hope to see in this class of simplified model . for example ,",
    "for the dirac dark matter , there sd interactions which correspond to the maximum values of @xmath30 at each mass point . in figures  [ fig : sdpredn ] and [ fig : sdpredp ] , we show the maximum allowed spin - dependent cross section on neutrons and protons ( respectively ) , given the constraints from colliders and xenon . based on these results ,",
    "the outlook for sd searches is such that large improvements over the current generations of experiments will be necessary if a dirac simplified model of the type considered here accurately represents the low energy physics of dark matter .",
    "in contrast , the forecast for sd searches for majorana dark matter , shown in figures  [ fig : msdpredn ] and [ fig : msdpredp ] , show that there is hope in the near - future for these searches to make a discovery .",

    "we compute the thermally averaged annihilation cross section to all possible quark pairs @xmath54 at the time of freeze - out using micromegas @xcite and the results are shown in figures  [ fig : annd ] and [ fig : annm ] .",
    "these figures indicate that for this class of simplified model , the bounds from colliders and direct detection are already strong enough that additional annihilation channels would be required to allow for the dark matter to be a thermal relic with a standard cosmology if it is dirac . instead ,",
    "if it is majorana , there are accessible regions where it could be a standard thermal relic .",
    "we have considered simplified models where the dark matter is either a dirac or majorana fermion , and interacts with a quark as well as a colored mediator .",
    "we found that the demands of gauge invariance suggest that when the dark matter is an electroweak singlet , only three classes of mediator are possible .",
    "minimal flavor violation further suggests that the couplings and masses of the mediators are flavor - universal , with some freedom with respect to the third generation that we chose not to explore here .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that we have been pushed toward a simplified model that essentially already existed to interpret searches for squark - like states .",
    "we have found that by trading the lhc production cross section as one of its defining parameters for the strength of the coupling of the dark matter to a quark and a scalar mediator , we arrive at a full effective field theory with the same number of parameters , but capable of describing the physics of dark matter even outside of the context of colliders .    we have derived the bounds from collider searches and elastic scattering of the dark matter from nuclei via either spin - independent or spin - dependent interactions .",
    "we find that the two probes are complementary to one another , and provide different kinds of information .",
    "the summarized bounds for dirac and majorana dark matter are shown in figures  [ fig : dbound ] and [ fig : mbound ] , which represent our best knowledge to date of such constructions .",
    "these simplified models are potentially uv - complete sketches of dark matter , and can realistically capture some of its most important features . if a robust detection of dark matter lies in the near future , the first step to establishing it as dark matter and putting it into the context of particle physics will be to explore these models and their close cousins , to determine which ones seem to most accurately explain the experimental data . ultimately , the hope is to connect with a complete theory of dark matter which will extend the sm into a more fundamental theory .",
