    "in other experiments , the poor photon detection efficiencies @xcite mean that correlations are not strong enough to violate a bell inequality , unless additional assumptions are utilized .",
    "in short , a clear violation applicable to all local hidden variable theories has not yet been experimentally observed .",
    "it has been widely suggested that the use of highly efficient detection techniques like homodyne detection @xcite may provide an avenue to overcome the detection efficiency problems @xcite with bell s theorem .",
    "already , continuous variable ( cv ) realizations of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox have been achieved with high efficiencies @xcite , using optical homodyne detection @xcite . in this case , the epr paradox is reformulated in terms of field quadrature phase amplitudes which have commutators like position and momentum . the epr paradox , however , only demonstrates the incompatibility of local realism ( lr ) with the completeness of quantum mechanics .",
    "it does not test local realism itself .",
    "proposals to demonstrate an incompatibility of quantum theory with local hidden variable theories using continuous variables require new formalisms , since bell s original inequality was only applicable to discrete or binned outcomes .",
    "early proposals for such tests using cv measurements @xcite relied on binning the initially continuous outcome domains to obtain binary results . here",
    "the original bell clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequalities @xcite are applicable . however , these predicted violations of bell s inequality were small and involved states that were difficult to prepare .",

    "these results support the earlier work of mabk , which also showed an exponential improvement of violation for @xmath0-partite states for spin measurements .",
    "since these inequalities require detection at every site , one might expect this improvement to be counteracted by increasing sensitivity to detection losses .",
    "work on the robustness of mermin - bell and cfrd - bell violations with loss @xcite shows that this is not the case .",
    "other calculations using different lhv assumptions @xcite have suggested a loss threshold as low as @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "however , since this proposal uses additional assumptions about the lhv models , it may not rule out all lhv theories .    in the present paper ,",
    "we introduce a new approach to nonlocality that utilizes a general functional optimization of continuous variable observables.we  in the most symmetric case both the number of modes required , and the required efficiency are dramatically reduced .",
    "the wider range of quantum states considered here include states which can be straightforwardly obtained from a polarisation ghz state of the type generated in current experiments .",
    "these are different to the extreme photon - number correlated states considered by acin _",
    "et al _ , which may be an experimental advantage .",
    "a simple example of a functional transformation is obtained when binning of a cv observable is used to give discrete binary outcomes @xcite . in this case , the cfrd inequalities reduce to those of mermin @xcite . here , our analysis is similar to that of acin _ et al_. @xcite . for binary outcomes ,",
    "one can use extensions of mermin s inequalities @xcite for the extreme states @xmath4 .",

    "vi these results are compared with the shchukin - vogel ( sv ) inequality for larger numbers of observables , showing that this gives identical results to the simpler cfrd method , in the cases studied . in section vii",
    "we include the effects of loss and noise on the violations of the functional moment inequalities and mabk inequalities . optimizing the choice of measured function reveals a quantum nonlocality for larger losses and for greater degrees of decoherence than possible previously .",
    "section viii gives an overview of the results .    in summary",
    ", we examine in this paper the effect of loss and state preparation impurity on tests of local realism using functional moments .",
    "our motivation is the fundamental challenge of developing an experimentally feasible loop - hole free test of local realism , which balances the need for a simple experimental realization with robustness against loss and noise .",
    "early work on bell inequalities utilized measurements of spin , making it seem that obtaining discrete measurement outcomes was a crucial ingredient to violating a bell inequality .",
    "in fact , this is not essential .",
    "the cfrd inequality is a multipartite test of local realism involving any two observables measured at each of @xmath0 sites , with causal separation between measurement at each site .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the following inequality must hold for all lhv theories : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the outcomes of two arbitrary measurements @xcite at each site labeled @xmath11 .",
    "the measurements are causally separated , and @xmath12 indicates an average over a set of local hidden variables @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "these correlations involve operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 at each site @xmath11 , with eigenvalues @xmath17 .",
    "unlike in hidden variable theories , these inequalities _ can _ be violated for certain quantum states , if the operators do not commute . despite the notation used ,",
    "nothing is assumed about the type of measurement operators . in lhv theories ,",
    "the inequality must be satisfied by measurements with any type of spectrum , discrete or continuous , and even unbounded outcomes .",
    "for this inequality to be useful , one must find states and observables that violate the inequality within quantum theory , and are obtainable in an experiment .",
    "it is important to recall here that when @xmath15 , @xmath16 are described within quantum mechanics by non - commuting operators , the corresponding physical variables are not simultaneously measurable .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-fold products in the above inequality each involve a sum over @xmath18 distinct correlation measurements with different settings of the measurement apparata .",
    "while the inequality is valid in general , we wish to apply it to experiments in quantum or atom optics , which are known to be able to produce highly correlated , nonclassical quantum states .",
    "operationally , we will consider the case where conventional photodetectors are replaced by a homodyne detector using a local oscillator , in order to detect field quadratures rather than photon numbers .",
    "as well as involving an intrinsically efficient experimental technique , this method is already known to be robust against loss , without additional assumptions .",
    "although quadrature measurements are traditionally used for coherent and squeezed states , they of course can also be used for states with well - defined overall particle number . in principle , exactly the same techniques apply to any boson fields , including , for example , ultra - cold atoms .",
    "we assume there are @xmath0 sites at which one can make observations , with an adjustable local oscillator phase to define local quadrature operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 . in the case that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are associated with single - mode bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath19 @xmath20 , one has @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these are the quadrature phase amplitudes associated with the boson annihilation operator @xmath20 , or for suitable choice of units , ( see the appendix ) the position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator , with commutators : @xmath23=\\frac{i}{2}\\delta_{mn}\\,\\,.\\ ] ] one can adjust the local oscillator phase to detect linear combinations of position and momentum .",
    "hence , we can introduce a general quadrature phase operator : @xmath24    for continuous measurements of quadrature variables on entangled boson states , we define generalized ghz states to be:@xmath25 here the integer @xmath26 is the maximum number of modes having nonzero photon number .",
    "the critical efficiency @xmath27 required for violation of the cfrd inequality in the symmetric case of @xmath28 tends to @xmath29 , as @xmath3 .",
    "quadrature measurements with local oscillators are inherently highly efficient compared to spin or photon - number measurements , with reported efficiencies of @xmath30 .",
    "however , generation losses from mode - matching can degrade the experimental efficiency , so @xmath31 is still a challenging practical benchmark , especially with large numbers of correlated modes",
    ".      functional transformations of any output measurements are always possible experimentally .",
    "any data file of experimental results is trivially processed into a function or set of functions of the original measured data . while this procedure is not very useful for binary results , it represents a large functional space of measurements in the continuous variable case .    in terms of hidden - variable theories ,",
    "this simply means that all measured quantities @xmath32 can be replaced by a function @xmath33 . in quantum mechanics",
    ", this implies that all eigenvalues @xmath34 are replaced by @xmath35 , or in operator language , the measurement operator @xmath36 is replaced by @xmath37 the details of this procedure are explained in later sections .",
    "we will show that such functional transformations greatly reduce the number of sites and the critical efficiencies needed to violate a bell inequality .",
    "in this section we will review the cfrd inequality @xcite as applied to quadrature measurements , and provide a more complete analysis of its violation than in the letter that introduced it .",
    "quadrature observables at @xmath0 sites are considered here , as described in the previous section .      at each site",
    ", the sign associated with @xmath16 can be chosen to obtain either @xmath38 or @xmath39 for each of the terms in the left hand side ( @xmath40 ) of .",
    "the choice of sign is important to maximise the violations for a given state . defining a variable @xmath41 to represent this choice for each site ,",
    "we denote by @xmath42 and @xmath43 the corresponding combination of measurements at each site .",
    "the cfrd inequality then reduces to @xmath44 cfrd showed that within quantum theory , the symmetric state @xmath45 violates this inequality for @xmath1 .",
    ", so that this state represents @xmath0 distinct modes at spatially separated sites , and each mode is occupied by one or zero photons .",
    "thus , the states @xmath46 , @xmath47 are eigenstates of the number operator @xmath48 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , so the prediction could in principle be tested with photonic ghz states produced in the laboratory .",
    "while a value of @xmath51 is not impossible , it is a large number of correlated modes for a practical experiment which involves multiple down - conversions and beam - splitters .",
    "this type of symmetric ghz state is obtainable from the usual ghz polarized state via a local unitary transformation at each location .",
    "for example , the symmetric state given above can be prepared from an @xmath52-photon polarization ghz state , of a type that is found in some current experiments @xcite @xmath53 a possible procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , where @xmath54 represent horizontally or vertically polarized single - photon states , by passing each photon through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "this converts polarization modes into spatial modes , so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are number states for the horizontally and vertically polarised modes respectively .",
    "the @xmath59 state then becomes @xmath60 of ( [ eq : n/2 state ] ) .    on - demand state generation",
    "some caution is needed here in interpreting current ghz experiments @xcite .",
    "these typically involve conditional measurements , rather than a known initial quantum state . to our knowledge",
    ", current experiments only generate ghz states in the sense that state is identified after some number of photon - counting events have already taken place . here",
    "we assume a more traditional quantum mechanical state preparation , in that we assume a ghz state can be generated on demand .",
    "we note that a proposal already exists for carrying out on - demand generation of a singlet state@xcite , which is the simplest case .",
    "current experimental techniques for ghz states would therefore need similar modifications to produce a well - defined ghz state ` on demand ' .",

    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : bell with r ] that no violations are possible for @xmath66 , and the optimal case has @xmath26 approximately equal to @xmath52 . for @xmath0 even , where @xmath28 there is a violation if    @xmath67    in agreement with cavalcanti _",
    "@xcite who have shown this requires @xmath1 . for odd @xmath0",
    ", we select @xmath68 to obtain a violation if@xmath69 which is obtained for @xmath70 .    [ [ section ] ]    , as described in sections iiia and iiib .",
    "the cluster state of is a superposition of two terms which correspond to ghz states of type with respectively . from fig .",
    "[ fig : bell with r ] , we note there is no bell violation when .",
    "the effect is that this cluster state case is less optimal than the symmetric ghz state ( @xmath28 ) and no violation of the @xmath71 cfrd inequality is observed .",
    "thus , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the @xmath57 and @xmath58 being number states for each polarized mode denoted by subscript @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "as explained in section 3a , these states can be converted to the states @xmath60 of ( [ eq : n/2 state ] ) with @xmath74 via the apparatus of fig .",

    "in early proposals for obtaining inequalities to test local realism with continuous variable measurements , only the sign of the quadrature variable is recorded @xcite . as far as lhv theories are concerned , it is just the final outcomes that are relevant , not the quantum operators corresponding to them .",
    "this allows one to use the same logic that is employed for dichotomic spin variables .",
    "our results here are therefore similar to those of earlier workers @xcite . as in the work of @xcite",
    ", we find an exponential improvement in bell violation with increasing number of sites , but we demonstrate that result for a larger class of states , some of which may be within experimental feasibility .",
