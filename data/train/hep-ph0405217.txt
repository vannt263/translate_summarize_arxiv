    "a great deal of attention has been paid to parity violation ( pv ) in the electroweak standard model ( sm ) well over decades in the context of high - precision tests for the sm  @xcite .",
    "a recent series of parity - violating experiments in atomic physics measured the weak charge of the sm  @xcite .",
    "its discrepancy with the sm implies a possibility of new physics , for example , a possible existence of the @xmath5 boson in addition to the @xmath6 boson  @xcite .",
    "recently , strangeness - conserving ( @xmath0 ) weak processes have paved the way of probing subtle properties of the nucleon such as the strangeness in the nucleon : the strange vector form factors were recently extracted by measuring the asymmetries of pv @xmath7 parity - violating scattering  @xcite .",
    "hadronic and nuclear pv processes , however , are far from clear understanding due to the screening of the strong interaction .",
    "a simple framework to describe hadronic and nuclear pv processes is one - boson exchange ( obe ) such as @xmath8- , @xmath9- , and @xmath10-changes  @xcite _  la _ the strong nucleon - nucleon potential through obe  @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients of the pv obe model are the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , which can be extracted from pv observables in various hadronic and nuclear reactions like @xmath14 elastic scattering  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the weak pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath17 is one of the most important quantities dominant in pv weak hadronic processes at low - energy regions  @xcite .",
    "however , disagreement in determining the @xmath17 still exists  @xcite theoretically as well as experimentally .    a recent series of works  @xcite studied the @xmath17 within the skyrme model , based on the effective current - current interaction which can be identified as a factorization scheme .",
    "however , it is natural to describe the @xmath18 pv processes based on the effective weak hamiltonian evolved from a scale of 80 gev down to around 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the nonleptonic weak processes defy any explanation from the factorization , or the strict large-@xmath19 limit .",
    "the octet enhancement in @xmath20 decays is partially explained by gluon penguin diagrams , which indicates that the strong interaction plays an essential role in describing the nonleptonic or hadronic decay processes .",
    "thus , in the present work , we shall derive the @xmath0 effective weak chiral lagrangian ( ew@xmath21l ) incorporating the effective weak hamiltonian  @xcite , based on the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum  @xcite , which will provide a good theoretical framework in studying the weak coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the @xmath0 ew@xmath21l to order @xmath22 in the chiral limit and to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the @xmath2 expansion , keeping in mind that the present results of the nlo in @xmath19 corrections are just a part of the whole @xmath2 nlo contributions .",
    "the nonlocal chiral quark model induced from the instanton vacuum has several virtues : it was shown that this momentum dependence gives the correct end - point behavior of the quark virtuality for the pion wave function  @xcite .",
    "similarly , recent investigations on the effective weak chiral lagrangian  @xcite indicate that the momentum - dependent quark mass plays a significant role in enhancing the @xmath23 channel .",
    "furthermore , nonlocality of the quark introduces a unique feature to the low - energy constants ( lec )  @xcite , compared to other models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we show how to incorporate the @xmath0 effective weak hamiltonian . in section iii , we discuss the present results of the low - energy constants .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the lec is studied with respect to the momentum - dependent quark mass . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize the present work and draw conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will show how to incorporate the @xmath0 effective weak hamiltonian into the effective chiral action from the instanton vacuum .",
    "the detailed description can be found in ref .",
    "we employ the @xmath0 effective pv weak hamiltonian derived in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath24 , \\label{heff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 in euclidean space , and @xmath27 denotes the generator of the color @xmath28 group , normalized as @xmath29 .",
    "the definitions of the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath9 are given in @xcite .",
    "these coefficients are the functions of the scale - dependent wilson coefficient @xmath35 defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath38 is the renormalization point and specifies the mass scale , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the mass of the @xmath41 boson .",
    "@xmath42 encodes the effect of the strong interaction from the perturbative gluon exchanges .",
    "numerical values of the coefficients relevant to our discussion with various @xmath42 values are listed in tab .",
    "[ coeff ] .",
    ".strong enhancements with selected values of @xmath42 . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the weinberg and the cabbibo angles , respectively .",
    "[ coeff ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is one last remark : we want to mention that there is a matching problem between the scale of the effective weak hamiltonian and that of the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum . while the scale of the effective weak hamiltonian is determined by the renormalization point , which is around 1 gev , that of the nonlocal chiral quark model comes from the average size of the instanton , i.e. @xmath45 . strictly speaking",
    ", one has to match these two different scales  @xcite .",
    "however , we will not consider this problem here , since it is a rather delicate one and requires a more cautious investigation .",
    "in the present work , we concentrated on deriving the @xmath46 effective weak lagrangian incorporating the effective weak hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "based on the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum , we obtained the @xmath0 parity - violating effective weak chiral lagrangian with the low - energy constants of the gasser - leutwyler type determined .",
    "the dependence of the low - energy constants on the dynamic quark mass @xmath47 and on the type of form factors was studied .",
    "the effects of the strong interaction were introduced according to the two different origins : the effect of nonperturbative qcd which is implemented in the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vaccum , and the wilson coefficients which encode the effect of perturbative gluons  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath48 effective weak chiral lagrangian  @xcite , the factorized quark loops in the integration over the quark field yield the lo terms , while the unfactorized quark loops do the nlo terms .",
    "we have determined the low - energy constants consisting of the wilson coefficients and dynamical quantities such as the pion decay constant and chiral condensate .",
    "we have estimated the strong enhancement effects in the lo of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "when it is neglected , our result turns out to be equivalent with the effective weak chiral lagrangian used by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 effective weak chiral lagrangian in the present work can be utilized to various strangeness  conserving weak hadronic processes .",
    "for example , one can derive the weak meson coupling constants such as @xmath49 .",
    "one can also study the parity violating non ",
    "leptonic weak interactions of mesons such as @xmath50 or @xmath51 of which the upper bound of the decay modes are experimentally known only  @xcite .",
