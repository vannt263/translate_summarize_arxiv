    "the idea that an analytic approach to qcd in the strong coupling regime is a viable possibility has recently received support from the recognition that the ads / cft correspondence conjecture @xcite could be applied to qcd - like gauge theories @xcite . in the ads / cft conjecture",
    ", a correspondence is supposed to exist between the supergravity limit of a superstring / m theory defined in a @xmath0 holographic space of total dimension @xmath1 and the large @xmath2 limit of a maximally superconformal @xmath3 ym theory living on the boundary @xmath4 of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "therefore qcd , being neither supersymmetric nor conformal , is different from the ym theories to which the ads / cft correspondence conjecture is applied ; however , in the regime where its coupling is nearly constant and where other scales such as the quark masses can be neglected , it can be considered as an approximately conformal field theory defined on the boundary of an ads - like holographic space .",
    "however , since confinement breaks conformal invariance , the ads geometry needs , at least , to be modified to account for such a phenomenon . indeed , various models have been proposed , namely introducing a maximum value ( ir hard wall ) of the @xmath6 holographic coordinate of the @xmath7 space interpreted as an energy scale ( the ir hard wall model @xcite ) , or considering an ir soft wall described by a background dilaton field ( the ir soft wall model @xcite ) . in both cases , a mass scale of the order @xmath8",
    "is introduced and the conformal invariance is broken . with such modifications of the ads space ,",
    "studies have been carried out in order to check whether properties of qcd are reproduced in the ads description ; in particular , the meson spectroscopy and the problem of chiral symmetry breaking have been considered , following a procedure which is usually denoted as the bottom - up approach to the ads / qcd correspondence @xcite .",
    "the glueball sector is one of the first issues investigated through the ads / qcd correspondence hypothesis , but mainly in the ( so - called top - down ) approach which attempts to extend the ads / cft duality to qcd - like gauge theories starting from a theory in a high dimensional space and breaking the conformal invariance and the supersymmetry , respectively , by compactification and by appropriate boundary conditions on the compactified dimensions @xcite . in this way",
    "qcd is recovered as a @xmath9 realization of a theory in higher dimensions , and scalar and tensor glueballs have been investigated in this framework @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "glueballs have also been studied in the bottom - up approach @xcite .",
    "the spectra of scalar and vector glueballs in the ir soft wall model have been determined , finding that they follow a linear regge behaviour ; moreover , the effects produced modifying the ads geometry or the dilaton profile in the ir have also been investigated , obtaining that perturbations influence in different ways the scalar and vector glueball masses @xcite .",
    "further information can be obtained from the analysis of the correlation function , as done e.g. in @xcite in the meson case . in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in investigating how the ads / qcd correspondence is realized for the two - point correlation functions of scalar glueball operators .",
    "similar analyses have been recently presented @xcite , but our conclusions are different , mainly as far as the values of the gluon condensates are concerned , together with their relation to the boundary conditions imposed in the holographic space .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : twop ] , we study the two - point correlation functions of the lowest dimension qcd operator describing the scalar glueballs , showing how the condensates are related to the bulk - to - boundary propagator defined in the holographic space . in section [ sec : klebanov ] , we focus on the dimension four gluon condensate derived from an ads / cft argument worked out by klebanov and witten ; this argument consists in relating the condensate to the expansion near the uv brane of the field holographically dual to the scalar glueball operator . in section [ sec : pert ] , we investigate how the correlation function is modified if the background dilaton field is perturbed , and the way the gluon condensate depends on such a perturbation . at the end",
