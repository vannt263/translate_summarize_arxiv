    "the discovery of materials without magnetic ordering down to zero temperature , but with an unusual cusp in the non - linear magnetic susceptibility @xcite indicating a transition to a magnetically frozen but random state , has prompted a theoretical effort spanning over thirty years and aimed at the understanding of the perplexing properties of these spin - glass systems @xcite .",
    "albeit mostly driven by the theoreticians hope to understand the peculiar behavior of such systems within the framework of statistical mechanics , the results of this research have found widespread application in seemingly rather distant fields such as the theory of associative memory @xcite , models of the immune system @xcite or error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "spin - glass science thus provides for a classical example of how research driven by curiosity rather than application can lead to unexpected progress in diverse research areas . the canonical case of a spin glass , i.e.",
    ", a noble metal host doped with magnetic transition metal ions @xcite is not of particular interest as a material apart from the peculiarity of its properties . in recent years , however , many new materials with possible spin - glass phases have been discovered in compounds with highly frustrating lattice structures @xcite .",
    "the large degeneracy of the ground state arising from geometric frustration alone gives rise to a host of novel and exotic magnetic phases , including spin glasses @xcite , but also spin liquids @xcite and spin ices @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that spin - glass like phenomena appear to lie at the heart of several ( potentially ) technologically important phenomena , such as high temperature superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance , and the anomalous hall effect .",
    "other than might be suspected from the pure volume of published research in the field @xcite , however , owed to the unwieldy nature of the problem , even some very basic questions such as the existence of a finite - temperature phase transition have in general remained unanswered to date @xcite .",
    "starting from the , by now , rather complete @xcite understanding of the unusually complex mean - field theory @xcite of the fully connected ( infinite dimensional ) sherrington - kirkpatrick @xcite ( sk ) model , recent research has focused on the case of finite - dimensional systems . for the nearest - neighbor o(@xmath1 ) edwards - anderson ( ea ) model @xcite with hamiltonian @xmath2 which has been studied in most detail ,",
    "most of the effort has been devoted to the discrete case of classical ising spins ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "even for this simplest case some controversial questions , such as the existence of a glassy phase at finite - temperatures in three dimensions ( 3d ) , could only be definitely answered in very recent years @xcite . in general , many features such as the generic structure of valleys and barriers in the free energy and , more generally , the question of whether spin glasses in finite dimensions behave essentially alike or differently from the mean - field case remain poorly understood @xcite .",
    "even the allegedly simplest case of the ising spin glass in two dimensions ( 2d ) remains a topic of lively research activity @xcite .    for most of the materials featuring glassy magnetic phases ,",
    "however , continuous _ xy _ or",
    "heisenberg spins certainly are a more accurate description than the ising model of extreme anisotropy in spin space @xcite . from the perspective of condensed matter physics ,",
    "much attention has been paid to the experimentally important case of weak , but frustrating impurities and the question of a resulting loss of collinear order .",
    "isolated frustrating antiferromagnetic defects in an otherwise ferromagnetic system couple to each other via an effective dipolar interaction @xcite , but it remains an open question whether collinear order can be destroyed with an arbitrarily small concentration of sufficiently strong defect bonds , and what role is played by the spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "such models are potentially relevant to the weakly doped copper - oxide parents of high-@xmath4 superconductors @xcite , while periodically frustrated _ xy _ systems are models of josephson junction arrays @xcite . for the strong disorder case of a spin glass with symmetric bond distribution , the question of whether there is a non - zero transition temperature ( for either or both of the spin and chiral sectors ) in 3d _ xy _ and heisenberg ea models is currently ( again ) hotly debated @xcite .    for the sk model ,",
    "the ordered phase is characterized by a breaking of the abstract replica symmetry @xcite , but the nature of symmetry breaking in the short range case is less clear . starting out from an essential analogy with the behavior of the ferromagnet ,",
    "a phenomenological droplet scaling theory for the effective coupling in spin glasses has been formulated @xcite .",
    "the surface ( free ) energy of droplet excitations of length @xmath5 is assumed to scale as @xmath6 , defining the spin stiffness exponent @xmath7 .",
    "put into the context of a renormalization group ( rg ) framework @xcite , @xmath7 determines whether a system scales to weak coupling ( @xmath8 ) such that droplets can always destabilize the ordered phase , thus restricting its extension to zero temperature , or scales towards strong coupling ( @xmath9 ) such that large - scale excitations are sufficiently costly to allow for a stable spin - glass phase at finite temperatures @xmath10 . in the infinite - range sk model ,",
    "the notion of droplets is maldefined and , instead , it is found that excitations of arbitrary size can be invoked at _ constant _ energy @xcite .",
    "consequently , if mean - field theory applies to low - dimensional spin glasses , low - energy excitations are of rather different nature implying , for instance , space filling domain walls @xcite .",
    "hence , an analysis of overlaps between ground and systematically excited states can in principle allow to distinguish between the droplet and mean - field pictures @xcite .",
    "a standard way of producing excitations is a change of boundary conditions ( bcs ) , e.g.  from periodic to antiperiodic , the energy difference between both configurations capturing the energy of a relative domain wall @xcite .    for the 2d ising spin glass ,",
    "domain - wall energies scale with @xmath11 for gaussian bond distribution @xcite and @xmath12 for bimodal couplings @xcite , and a true thermodynamic spin - glass phase occurs only at zero temperature in both cases . from the rg ansatz of ref . , @xmath7 determines the divergence of the correlation length @xmath13 as @xmath14 via @xmath15 , which is found to be consistent with finite - temperature monte carlo results for the gaussian case @xcite . for the bimodal @xmath16 distribution , on the other hand , the formal @xmath17 has been interpreted as _",
    "exponential _ divergence @xcite of @xmath13 , but some evidence for an algebraic singularity has also been presented recently @xcite ( see also ref .  ) . for the case of continuous _ xy _ or heisenberg spins , the situation is complicated by the fact that the non - collinear spin structure in the ordered phase allows for the distinction of proper and improper o(@xmath1 ) transformations , such that the continuous so(@xmath1 ) rotational symmetry is augmented by a @xmath18 or ising - like _ chiral _ symmetry related to the determinant of the o(@xmath1 ) rotation matrix @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that these chiral degrees - of - freedom might decouple from the rotational ordering , resulting in different transition temperatures ( above the lower critical dimension ) or , at least , an additional chiral stiffness exponent @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 ) .",
    "such a scenario is  after a long - winded debate  now quite well established in some periodically frustrated magnets @xcite , but remains fervently debated for the case of spin glasses @xcite . for the 2d _ xy _ spin glass , neither has @xmath7 been determined consistently , with estimates ranging from @xcite @xmath21 to @xcite @xmath22 , nor has the question of a possible spin - chirality decoupling been satisfactorily resolved @xcite .    methodologically , the above uncertainties regarding the _ xy _ spin glass are related to various technical difficulties .",
    "firstly , finding ground states of spin - glass model systems is a computationally hard problem , generically believed to require an effort growing exponentially with system size @xcite .",
    "the 2d ising spin glass on planar graphs is the only non - trivial exception to this rule , being polynomial computationally @xcite , and allowing for the rather precise estimate of @xmath7 cited above .",
    "thus , reliable spin - glass ground state computations depend in general on rather elaborate and specifically tailored approximation algorithms to treat reasonably sized systems . in this context",
    ", we use here the recently proposed `` genetic embedded matching '' ( gem ) technique @xcite to investigate the zero - temperature properties of the 2d _ xy _ spin - glass model . for the ising problem",
    "mentioned , due to the existence of rather pronounced finite - size effects @xcite relatively large system sizes turned out to be necessary for reliable estimates , e.g. , of @xmath7 .",
    "below , we will see how progress in accessing much larger system sizes using the gem approach now allows for investigations where finite - size effects seem for the first time rather well controlled .",
    "secondly , there is no full agreement as to how bcs should be chosen in order to precisely excite either spin or chiral defects @xcite .",
    "this is of particular concern here , given that strong corrections to scaling depending on the chosen set of bcs have been observed for the ising case @xcite . here",
    ", we systematically study a wide range of bcs and resolve the boundary dependent corrections to scaling .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : algo ] briefly discusses the employed gem technique and the technical set - up of the calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gs_energy ] , we discuss the asymptotic ground - state energy and the spectrum of metastable states found in the gem calculations , while sec.[sec : walls ] reports on the properties of excitations induced by a change of bcs .",
    "in particular , spin and chiral stiffness exponents and the associated fractal dimensions of domain walls are determined .",
    "some of these results already were reported in part in ref .  .",
    "section [ sec : overlaps ] contains our results for the scaling of overlap distributions , and sec .",
    "[ sec : further ] presents some results on the distribution of internal fields and the disorder strength vs.  disorder concentration phase diagram of the 2d randomly frustrated _ xy _ magnet . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "zero - temperature properties might be inferred from the @xmath23 limit of finite - temperature calculations such as monte carlo simulations .",
    "the latter , however , suffer from severe slowing down as the @xmath24 critical point is approached for this system , thus rendering the extrapolated results rather unreliable .",
    "hence we chose , instead , to determine ground states directly from non - equilibrium methods .",
    "apart from the 2d ising ea model on planar graphs , such computations are believed ( and in some cases proven ) to be _ np _ hard optimization problems @xcite . to make progress with the 2d _ xy _ model",
    ", we take inspiration from the approach making the 2d ising ea model solvable @xcite . in particular , we _ embed _ ising variables into the continuous _ xy _ spins : with respect to a random , but fixed direction @xmath25 in spin space , the o(@xmath1 ) spins @xmath26 of ( [ eq : ea_model ] ) decompose as @xmath27 .",
    "this results in a decomposition of @xmath28 as @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and where the effective couplings @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 if now the original o(@xmath1 ) rotations of the spins are restricted to reflections along the plane defined by @xmath25 , @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 are easily seen to be invariant under such reflections of individual spins , whereas the @xmath36 change sign .",
    "hence , for a given @xmath25 , @xmath37 in ( [ eq : embedded_hamiltonian ] ) takes on the form of an ising model with effective ising `` spins '' @xmath36 .",
    "the tractability of the 2d ising ground - state problem in polynomial time comes about via the transformation to a graph - theoretical formulation @xcite .",
    "it rests on a dualization of the model : define elementary plaquettes of the square lattices to be frustrated if one or three of their surrounding bonds are antiferromagnetic @xcite . for a given spin configuration , mark dual bonds of the square lattice as `` active '' if the corresponding original bond is unsatisfied , i.e. , if @xmath38 .",
    "then , from the very definition of a frustrated plaquette , the set of `` active '' ( dual ) bonds consists of individual chains which are either closed loops or open chains connecting pairs of frustrated plaquettes , and the total energy of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : ea_model ] ) is ( up to a constant ) identical to the total sum of @xmath39 along the `` active '' bonds . since on a planar lattice closed loops",
    "can always be removed by contraction , a ground state of the spin system corresponds to a _ minimum - weight perfect matching _ of the frustrated plaquettes , i.e. , a configuration of the active bonds matching up all pairs of frustrated plaquettes while minimizing the total weight @xmath40 of bonds contained .",
    "such problems can be solved in polynomial time by means of edmonds `` blossom algorithm ''",
    "@xcite , and , most importantly , the solution can be shown to always correspond to a valid spin configuration for the case of planar graphs @xcite . as a result ,",
    "application of ( anti-)periodic bcs is restricted to at most one direction to preserve planarity .",
    "see refs .   for a more detailed account of the relation between the ising ground state and graph - theoretical matching problems .",
    "using the decomposition ( [ eq : embedded_hamiltonian ] ) for the o(@xmath1 ) hamiltonian ( [ eq : ea_model ] ) , the blossom algorithm can be used to find exact ground states of the embedded ising spins @xmath36 , corresponding to a reflection of some of the continuous spins with respect to the plane defined by a randomly chosen direction @xmath25 .",
    "a random sequential sampling of directions @xmath25 is used to statistically recover the full o(@xmath1 ) symmetry .",
    "this _ embedded matching _",
    "procedure is a strictly downhill search which , however , due to its non - local nature originating from the exact ground - state computation for the embedded ising spins , features far less metastable states than a zero - temperature quench with any local dynamics @xcite . due to the dependence of the effective couplings @xmath34 of ( [ eq : embedded_couplings ] ) on the configuration @xmath41",
    ", the embedded matching dynamics normally drives the system into a ( low - lying ) metastable state instead of the true ground state .    to find true ground states ,",
    "the above embedded matching must be supplemented by a complementary protocol .",
    "we do so by inserting the embedded matching ( i.e. , minimization technique ) as an optimization component ( subroutine ) into a specially tailored _",
    "genetic algorithm _",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", a whole population of candidate ground state configurations is being worked on , continuously undergoing an improvement process mimicking natural evolution , which allows for a very efficient exploration of the landscape of metastable states of the system :    * * crossover : * a random pair of spin configurations is selected as `` parent configurations '' and locally rigid domains or clusters are exchanged at random between them to produce `` offspring '' ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "* * mutation * : a small proportion of spins of either offspring are randomly perturbed . * * optimization * : both offspring are optimized using the embedded matching technique . * * selection * : each parent is replaced by the morphologically closer offspring in case the latter has a lower internal energy .",
    "the most crucial step in this sequence is the `` crossover '' operation .",
    "indeed , special attention must be paid to the way configurations are combined in the crossover to balance the need for `` genetic '' diversification with the preservation of the high optimization on short length scales already achieved at intermediate steps of the process .",
    "statistical analyzes show that the above combination of techniques in this _ genetic embedded matching _ ( gem ) approach allows for a reliable determination of ground states for 2d _ xy _ spin glass samples of up to about @xmath42 spins with current computing resources .",
    "the algorithmic details of the gem technique are quite intricate",
    ". a presentation of those details here would detract from our main agenda , which is to focus , and report , on the _ physical _ properties of the ground state of the 2d _ xy _ spin glass .",
    "a full account of the algorithmic details of the gem technique can be found in ref .  .    for specificity",
    ", we assume a bimodal distribution of the quenched random couplings @xmath39 of ( [ eq : ea_model ] ) , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the relative strength of the antiferromagnetic impurity bonds @xmath45 and @xmath46 their concentration . unless stated otherwise , we averaged with respect to the distribution ( [ eq : coupling_distribution ] ) by taking @xmath47 independent disorder realizations and concentrated on the symmetric point @xmath48 , @xmath49 , deep in the spin - glass regime of model ( [ eq : ea_model ] ) with @xmath50 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling_distribution ] ) .",
    "all computations discussed here were performed on square lattices .",

    "production of the data presented here consumed the equivalent of about @xmath52 years of single cpu time .",
    "to determine the asymptotic ground - state energy , we performed a finite - size scaling analysis with systems of different bcs , namely open and open - periodic ( as mentioned above , fully periodic boundaries are not accessible to the method due to the planarity constraint @xcite ) .",
    "we used @xmath53 systems with linear dimensions @xmath54 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , and 28 and with @xmath47 disorder replica for each system size .",

    ", we shall restrict ourselves to analytical corrections here .",
    "then , the most general form would be @xmath68 we first consider the case of fully open boundaries . noting that in this case the analytical corrections can be at least partly attributed to the presence of edges and corners ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .  ) , campbell _ et al_.@xcite take a slightly different approach and , instead of using @xmath58 , consider the energy @xmath69 per _ bond _ as the fundamental property , making the following scaling ansatz , @xmath70 with @xmath71 representing edge effects and @xmath72 accounting for corner corrections .",
    "no term proportional to @xmath73 is included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bond_energy_free ] ) arguing that free boundaries do not force any domain walls into the system .",

    "one interesting question is whether spin and/or chiral defects should contribute to the domain - wall correction to the internal energy",
    ". we will show below in sec .",
    "[ sec : walls ] that the chiral defects are of much lower absolute energy for the considered lattice sizes than the spin defects , such that essentially only the spin defects are at play here , justifying post factum the interpretation of @xmath7 as the spin - stiffness exponent",
    ". our best estimate for the asymptotic ground - state energy , @xmath85 , should be compared with the value @xmath116 of the bimodal 2d ising spin glass @xcite which is , perhaps surprisingly , only about @xmath117 higher .",
    "hence , the enhanced ability of the continuous model compared to the discrete ising case to locally adapt does not allow to substantially relieve the frustration imposed by the bond disorder ( the unfrustrated system yielding , of course , @xmath118 ) .      while a finely - tuned choice of parameters in the gem approach guarantees high reliability for the optimization to arrive at a ground state , less optimal settings ( in particular a reduction of the initial population size below a certain threshold ) result in runs converging to low - lying metastable states instead @xcite .",
    "additionally , and irrespective of the parameter choice , a part of the spectrum of low - lying metastable states appears as intermediate population members in the course of the optimization procedure . for a finite system",
    "this spectrum appears discrete ( see below ) , and one naturally wonders what the nature of these excitations is . comparing the configurations of some of these states , it is clearly seen that on short length scales the system is rigid within the space of energy minima , i.e. , it naturally decomposes into stiff _",
    "clusters _ of solidary spins whose individual moments have very similar orientations in all of the low - lying metastable states , apart from relative , essentially exact o(@xmath1 ) rotations of whole clusters .",
    "indications of such rigid clusters have been found in previous studies of ising @xcite and continuous - spin systems @xcite .",
    "however , the genuine existence of such clusters for continuous spins had so far not been as well established numerically as we are able to achieve here with the gem method .",
    "note that such clusters are the finite - energy analogue of the `` backbone '' or `` rigid lattice '' of sites with constant relative spin orientation in all ground states observed in the @xmath16 ising spin glass with a large ground - state degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the gem approach , and ultimately , its ability to determine the ground states , heavily relies on this cluster structure in the choice of operation for the crossover procedure exchanging such rigid domains between the `` parent '' replica , cf .  the discussion in sec .",

    "[ fig : snapshots ] ) .",
    "naturally , each of these states has an @xmath124 degeneracy corresponding to a global ( proper or improper ) rotation of all spins .",
    "conversely , however , we checked for additional non - trivial degeneracies and found that statistically independent gem runs always converged to an o(@xmath1 ) rotated copy of the same state .",
    "hence , the ground state of the system appears unique modulo the global symmetry .",
    "consequently , quantities related to statistical fluctuations vanish at @xmath24 and @xmath125 , the exponent of the correlation function , is equal to zero @xcite . in terms of the clusters of rigid spins observed , the unique ground state results from the fact that the rigid clusters are not free , but their rigid o(@xmath1 ) rotations have some non - vanishing excitation energy from necessary local adaptations of boundary spins .    by design ,",
    "the gem approach does not explicitly find _ all _ states of a given energy .",
    "in particular , as a non - equilibrium technique it does not find states with probabilities corresponding to their respective boltzmann weights .",
    "however , there is no reason to believe that in all cases a single of possibly a multitude of degenerate ground states would dominate so strongly that not a single degenerate state appears in the thousands of independent runs undertaken .",
    "in contrast , the combined binary symmetry of the bimodal ising spin glass results in a massive degeneracy of the ground state @xcite , such that already a typical @xmath126 system has between @xmath127 and @xmath128 ground states @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite and migdal - kadanoff rg calculations @xcite have led to speculations that the pairing of bimodal couplings with the discrete chiral symmetry might give rise to a similar situation in the bimodal _ xy _ spin - glass model considered here .",
    "certainly , if calculations such as finite - temperature monte carlo simulations are sensitive to a ( possibly narrow ) _ range _ of energies , the observed dense spectrum of states might effectively appear as quasi - degenerate , resulting in an erroneously non - zero estimate of @xmath125 from such simulations @xcite . also , one might speculate about degeneracies in excited states which we have not investigated here , but might have shown up in some of the previous studies .    the low - lying metastable states appearing in the process of a gem run might allow to learn something about the spectral properties of the system . assuming a unique leading exponent in the scaling of defect energies with length scale , it is interesting to see how the lowest - energy excitations corresponding to the gap relate to the domain - wall or droplet excitations that are crucial for the understanding of the spin - glass phase . in fig .",

    "the main result consists of a careful determination of the spin and chiral stiffness exponents of the model with bimodal coupling distribution , which characterize its critical behavior and directly relate to the question of a possible spin - chirality decoupling in this system . in principle , a stiffness exponent related to domain walls can be extracted from scaling corrections to the finite - size behavior of the ground - state energy , but the precision of the estimate resulting from this method is not satisfactory .",
    "instead , we investigated the properties of domain - wall defects directly induced by a suitable change of boundary conditions . in response to doubts regarding the suitability of the conventionally considered combination of periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions resulting in an effective measurement of _ differences _ of defect energies @xcite , we explicitly excite domain - wall defects of the spin and chiral type relative to a system with free boundaries by applying special `` domain - wall boundary conditions '' .",

    "the fact that in the present work , consistency between estimates of the stiffness exponent from different sets of boundary conditions with correction amplitudes of opposite signs could be achieved , makes it appear plausible that finally scaling corrections are under control to an acceptable degree of precision .",
    "concerning the claim put forward in ref .   that the p / ap combination of boundary conditions can not be used to estimate the spin stiffness exponent , the results of the aspect - ratio scaling show that the assumed trapping of domain walls in periodic systems @xcite only affects scaling corrections , but does not alter the asymptotic stiffness .",

    "it should be noted , however , that the chiral variables interact with an effective long - range coulombic interaction @xcite , possibly leading to a shift in universality class . on the other hand , for the recently established spin - chirality decoupling in the periodically frustrated _ xy _ model @xcite",
    ", the chiral transition appears to show onsager exponents , but this behavior is only seen for huge lattice sizes of @xmath337 , with wildly different behavior in the crossover region @xcite . for our data , since for a @xmath19 very close to zero it becomes very hard numerically to distinguish the leading scaling from sub - leading corrections , we can not definitely exclude the possibility of @xmath336 .",

    "chiral domain walls are by definition sharply localized .",
    "we find them to be fractal curves , and from the scaling of the corresponding link overlaps we estimate a fractal dimension @xmath247 .",
    "the definition of spin domain walls depends on a somewhat arbitrary cutoff angle , but we find the fractal dimension @xmath340 to be independent of the cutoff within some reasonable range . recently , evidence was presented for the hypothesis that domain walls in the ising spin glass are special fractal curves described by `` stochastic loewner evolution '' ( sle ) @xcite . comparing the numerical results with conformal weights of the kac table , the authors of ref .",

    "this appears to be corroborated by an explicit investigation of the distribution of overlaps in central windows far away from the boundaries , which , for the system sizes accessible here , appears to converge to a trivial form @xmath342 .",
    "this shows that the states defined by the considered set of boundary conditions always converge to the same class of thermodynamic pure states related by a global o(@xmath1 ) rotation , and we do not find evidence for a multitude of pure states .",
    "naturally , however , consideration of different types of boundary conditions might yield different results .",
    "the rate of this convergence is again related to a domain - wall fractal dimension , with a value compatible with @xmath233 as determined directly .",
