    "we determined @xmath246 and @xmath248 simultaneously from a coupled - channels calculation , by fitting to the scattering phase for two different energy values , for several values of the magnetic field .",
    "although the field - dependent effective range model agrees reasonably well with the coupled - channels binding energy for magnetic fields close to @xmath6 , it breaks down for fields larger than @xmath249 gauss and can not be applied further away from threshold .",
    "summarizing , the contact model , single - resonance feshbach model , and effective range model are low - energy approximations of the exact scattering matrix .",
    "these approaches give reasonable agreement with the coupled - channels molecular binding energy close to the resonant magnetic field @xmath6 , but for energies further away from threshold these descriptions give poor agreement .",
    "our model has several important advantages compared to the models discussed here .",
    "first of all , our model is directly based on the underlying physics of the interplay between potential and feshbach resonances .",
    "the contact potential model is based on the assumption that the scattering phase can be replaced by its low - energy limit , @xmath250 $ ] .",
    "as we have seen , the potential resonance and feshbach resonance introduce additional energy - dependence of the scattering phase shift .",
    "the single - resonance feshbach model would give an adequate description for the situation where @xmath10 is on the order of the range of the potential .",
    "however , when @xmath10 is large compared to this range , this model breaks down as well .",
    "the effective range approach gives a better description of the binding energy compared to the two previous models .",
    "however , it still breaks down at some point , and moreover , it does not give much physical insight in the mechanism behind the additional energy dependence of various cold - collision properties .",
    "another clear disadvantage of the effective range approach is that we have to calculate @xmath246 numerically as a function of the magnetic field using a coupled - channels method . in our model",
    "the binding energy is given by a simple analytical formula , which gives an excellent description even for magnetic fields far from @xmath6 and energies of order millikelvin .",
    "our model is fully characterized by only a few parameters , which can be extracted from coupled - channels calculations , or directly from measurements .",
    "has to be taken into account that has to be calculated numerically . ]",
    "another approach that has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is to use a double - resonance parametrization of the scattering matrix within the feshbach projection formalism .",
    "the second resonance introduced should account for the influence of the potential resonance on the properties of the feshbach resonance .",
    "the feshbach projection formalism can be used to describe potential resonances , albeit in a rather indirect manner . in a paper by domcke @xcite ,",
    "the feshbach projection - operator approach is used to describe potential resonances in scattering systems .",
    "the projector onto the resonance states is defined as @xmath251 , where the set of functions @xmath252 is an arbitrary orthonormal set of square - integrable functions .",
    "the formal requirement on the projection operator @xmath29 is given as @xmath253 the formalism leads to a decomposition of the scattering matrix into a resonant and a non - resonant part , where the resonances are all contained in @xmath27 space if @xmath254 is chosen large enough .",
    "the choice of the states @xmath255 to be used is arbitrary , however , and the correspondence between these states and the real resonance states ( such as the gamow states ) is not clear .",
    "more specifically , the gamow states in general do not satisfy relation eq .",
    "( [ limitq ] ) and can not be used to construct an operator onto the real resonance states within this formalism .    however , as domcke argues , increasing the number of states used in the projector @xmath29 by one , seems to remove exactly one resonance pole from the background part of the scattering matrix .",
    "one could therefore hope that adding an appropriate bound state @xmath256 , the virtual state resonance due to the gamow resonance state @xmath257 can be indirectly included in the @xmath27 subspace .",
    "this is the approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to account for the interplay between a feshbach resonance and a potential resonance in @xmath1li collisions .",
    "we will refer to this as the double - resonance approach .",
    "although the bound state introduced to account for the second resonance is not clearly linked to the @xmath28-channel virtual state that gives rise to the potential resonance , the double - resonance approach is mathematically equivalent to our model under some constraints .",
    "we will show this in the following .    introducing two @xmath29-channel bound states @xmath77 , one to account for the feshbach resonance ( @xmath258 ) and one to account for the virtual state resonance ( @xmath259 ) ,",
    "the direct part of the scattering matrix does not contain a resonant feature anymore and takes the form @xmath260 $ ] , where @xmath261 is on the order of the range of the interaction potential .",
    "the @xmath27 subspace contains the two resonances introduced above , and the total scattering matrix takes the form @xcite @xmath262 here @xmath263 is the detuning of the dressed state @xmath264 with energy @xmath265 .",
    "the decay width of the dressed state @xmath264 is given by @xmath266 .",
    "note that the energy shift of both resonance states is approximately constant , and the decay width scales with @xmath39 according to the wigner threshold law .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the removal of the low - energy resonance from the direct channel by including the state @xmath267 into the @xmath27 subspace .",
    "the poles of the scattering matrix determine the ( complex ) energy of the dressed resonance states .",
    "in the double - resonance approach these poles are determined by the condition @xmath268 in our model the poles are determined by the condition @xmath269 if we only take the @xmath28-channel virtual state and the @xmath29-channel bound state into account . in other words , we neglect the avoided crossing with the highest @xmath28-channel bound state . under the constraint that the dressed bound state that removes the potential resonance from the direct channel is located far away from the collision threshold , i.e. , @xmath270 , the two approaches are equivalent if the following relations are satisfied : @xmath271 these relations show how the double - resonance parameters are related to the position of the virtual state ( described by @xmath157 ) , and the zero - energy shift of the dressed feshbach resonance state , @xmath272 .",
    "note that the energy @xmath67 always has to be negligible compared to @xmath273 , otherwise the double - resonance s - matrix will introduce a non - physical energy - dependence in the scattering phase - shift .",
    "the double - resonance model does give an equivalent description of the scattering process , and can be used to parameterize the scattering matrix and/or scattering length .",
    "the link between the properties of the open - channel resonance and the second resonance introduced in the double - resonance model is not really clear .",
    "our model has the important advantage that it is directly related to the underlying physics giving rise to the @xmath28-channel resonance .",
    "in this paper , we have derived an analytical model that describes the cold - collision properties of two interacting particles near a feshbach resonance with large background scattering length .",
    "the large background scattering length results from an open - channel resonance near threshold , and this resonance has to be treated explicitly . the open - channel scattering is included in the feshbach theory of resonances via a contribution from its poles of the @xmath43 matrix , and its non - resonant open - channel background scattering length . here the latter corresponds to the true range of the potential . as an example , we study the @xmath274  g feshbach resonance of @xmath0rb , and we show that our model compares excellent with numerical coupled - channels calculations in a large range of energies around threshold .",
    "our model offers a simple physical picture for the understanding of threshold effects around resonance .",
    "it explains how the energy - shift between the dressed bound feshbach state and the bare molecular state can be found . in the literature",
    ", several other models have been proposed to describe the formation of ( quasi - bound ) molecules ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss in the following how our model compares to some other models .",
    "several ideas have been proposed to describe the formation of ( quasi - bound ) molecules . in some descriptions ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) the threshold and ( bare ) molecular state are regarded as a two - level system , with an effective coupling that accounts for the coupling between the open and closed channels .",
    "this results in a landau - zener crossing between the threshold state and the molecular state . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ avoided_virtual ] , a landau - zener crossing does not correctly describe the dressed molecular state in case the open channel has a virtual state near threshold .",
    "the difference is striking , since the quasi - bound state in the continuum starts from threshold at @xmath6 ( where @xmath3 is infinity ) , and then curves towards the bare feshbach state . in the landau - zener model the quasi - bound state curves towards threshold at the other side of the bare feshbach state . in case",
    "there is a real bound state in the open channel , the behavior of the dressed quasi - bound state appears to be qualitatively in agreement with the landau - zener crossing ( c.f .",
    "fig .  [ avoided_bound ] ) .",
    "however , this is only the case since there is a real avoided crossing below threshold between the feshbach state and the open - channel bound state .",
    "threshold effects ( visible in the inset ) are not accounted for in the landau - zener crossing .    in other descriptions",
    "@xcite ) the energy levels of an interacting pair of atoms in a harmonic trap are calculated . here",
    "the lowest state behaves as the feshbach bound state in the free - particle case for @xmath3 small and positive , and connects to the lowest harmonic oscillator state for @xmath3 small and negative .",
    "all other trap states start on one side of the resonance ( @xmath4 ) in a particular trap state @xmath199 , and are connected on the other side of the resonance ( @xmath5 ) to a trap state @xmath275 .",
    "there is a strong field dependence of the eigenenergies for field values close to resonance , and the bare trap - levels can be regarded as having avoided crossings with the quasi - bound state .",
    "this can be understood from analytical models of two trapped atoms  @xcite , which calculate the energy shift of the trapped atoms due to interactions , using the scattering phase as a boundary condition for the trap - wavefunction of the particles . in this way",
    ", it can be seen that the level - energy is strongly field dependent when it coincides with the quasi - bound feshbach state in the free - atom case . in the situation of a virtual state in the open channel ( c.f .",
    "fig.[avoided_virtual ] ) , the quasi - bound state energy changes its slope in a region close to threshold .",
    "the avoided crossings between bare trap - levels and quasi - bound feshbach state should therefore follow this behavior .    the interplay between an open - channel resonance and a feshbach resonance is usually not taken into account in the description of resonance many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "the open - channel will have an important effect in a regime where the energies of the system are of order of or larger than the energy of the open - channel virtual state .",
    "a clear example where this effect is visible is the ramsey - fringe experiment with @xmath0rb  @xcite , where the range of binding energies is so large that the bound state can not be properly described by a single - resonance model .",
