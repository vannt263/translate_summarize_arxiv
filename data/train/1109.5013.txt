    "a central problem in quantum information theory is that of interconversion between resources , for example , how to use communication channels to produce entanglement between distant parties , or how to use such entanglement to carry out nonlocal operations . in particular , the use of prior entanglement assisted by classical communication to carry out nonlocal unitaries has been the subject of various studies @xcite ; for a more extensive list see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we add _ time _ as a resource to be considered along with entanglement cost when constructing protocols for bipartite nonlocal unitaries ( nonlocal gates ) . the ability to implement nonlocal unitaries rapidly may be particularly relevant in the context of distributed quantum computation @xcite , where less time consumption means less decoherence ; or in position - based quantum cryptography @xcite , where it may allow certain position verification schemes to be broken .",
    "the usual protocols for bipartite unitaries , such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , have the following general structure : alice carries out local operations and measurements , and sends the measurement results through a classical communication channel to bob , who then carries out corresponding operations and measurements , and sends the measurement results back to alice using classical communication . finally , alice performs additional local operations that may depend on the previous measurement results of both parties .",
    "when the distance between the two parties is large the total time required for the protocol will be dominated by the two rounds of communication , thus double the minimum time for a signal to pass from one to the other .",
    "however , there exist nonlocal unitaries which can be implemented by a protocol in which alice and bob carry out local operations and measurements at the same time , and then simultaneously send the results to the other party , and finally perform local operations depending on the received messages to complete the protocol .",
    "this reduces the total communication time by a factor of two .",
    "we are interested in identifying which bipartite unitaries can be carried out using such a _ fast _ protocol , and also in finding the associated entanglement cost .",
    "the crucial distinction between a fast and slow protocol of the form considered here is that for the latter , bob needs to wait for a message from alice before choosing the basis in which to carry out his measurement ( `` choosing the measurement basis '' is equivalent to choosing what local gates to do before his measurement ) , whereas in the former this basis can be fixed in advance .",
    "we have identified two classes of nonlocal unitary that lend themselves to a fast protocol : _ controlled _ unitaries of the form shown in below , and _ group _ unitaries of the form shown in .",
    "the slow versions of both were considered in our previous work @xcite , where we showed that controlled unitary protocols , while useful for understanding how such protocols work , can always be replaced by group unitary protocols that make use of the same resources .",
    "our fast protocols represent special cases ( i.e. , special groups and parameter choices ) of the slow protocols discussed previously , and once again the controlled kind can be replaced by the group kind . by increasing the amount of entanglement expended , additional unitaries can be carried out using these fast protocols . in some cases",
    "this allows an arbitrarily close approximation to a unitary which can not be carried out exactly by these methods .",
    "a still more general class of slow protocols , corresponding to eq .  ( 18 ) in @xcite , also has a fast version , but we have yet to find examples of unitaries it can carry out that can not be implemented by our other fast protocols .",
    "the protocols we consider are deterministic  they succeed with probability one  and use a definite amount of entanglement determined in advance .",
    "such deterministic fast protocols have previously been studied by groisman and reznik @xcite for a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate on two qubits , and by dang and fan @xcite its counterpart on two qudits .",
    "in addition , buhrman _",
    "_ @xcite and beigi and knig @xcite have published approximate schemes for what they call `` instantaneous quantum computation , '' equivalent to a fast bipartite unitary in our language .",
    "these protocols , unlike ours , can be used , to approximately carry out any bipartite unitary .",
    "the one in @xcite , which is based on the nonlocal measurement protocol in @xcite , has a probability of success less than 1 , so it is not deterministic , but this probability can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by using sufficient entanglement .",
    "the protocol in @xcite uses a fixed amount of entanglement to implement with probability 1 a bipartite quantum operation ( completely positive trace preserving map ) which is close to the desired unitary , and it can be made arbitrarily close by using sufficient entanglement .",
    "the term `` instantaneous '' is not unrelated to the idea of an `` instantaneous measurement '' as discussed in @xcite , where the terminology seems somewhat misleading in that completing their protocols actually requires a finite communication time , e.g. , the parties must send the results to headquarters ( or to each other ) in order to complete the identification of the measured state .",
    "in the same way , `` instantaneous quantum computation '' actually requires a finite communication time , the same as in our fast protocol .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sct2 ] we consider controlled unitaries of the form eq .  , where the unitaries being controlled form an abelian group .",
    "( appendix  [ sct_extend ] contains an argument , which may be of more general interest , that allows projectors @xmath0 in this formula to be replaced by projectors of rank 1 . ) in addition we show how subsets of the collection of unitaries representing an abelian group can be employed to generate fast unitaries otherwise not accessible by our protocol .",
    "section  [ sct3 ] is devoted to group unitaries of the form , including a significant number of examples .",
    "we also present an argument showing that the controlled - abelian - group unitaries of sec .",
    "[ sct2 ] can be transformed to group unitaries of the form .",
    "the concluding sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] contains a brief summary along with an indication of some open problems .",
    "in this section we construct a fast protocol for any controlled - abelian - group unitary of the form @xmath1 where the @xmath0 are orthogonal projectors , possibly of rank greater than 1 , on a hilbert space @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 are unitary operators on a hilbert space @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 , that form a representation of an abelian group @xmath7 of order @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sbct_control_rank ] , it suffices to consider projectors of rank 1 .",
    "that is , a scheme for implementing @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes a ket belonging to a standard ( or computational ) orthonormal basis , is easily extended to one that carries out the more general .",
    "in addition we shall consider cases , sec .",
    "[ sbct2.3 ] , in which the @xmath4 form a _ subset _ of an abelian group , with the sum in restricted to a subset @xmath11 of the integers from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest abelian group is a cyclic group , so we start with the case where the @xmath4 in are a representation of such a group .",
    "( it suffices to consider ordinary representations , since a projective representation of a cyclic group is equivalent to an ordinary representation ; see sec .",

    "it will be convenient to let @xmath14 be the identity and @xmath15 .",
    "the slow protocol @xcite for this case , which works for any collection @xmath4 of unitaries on @xmath16 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] , where @xmath17 is a fully entangled state on the ancillary systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 associated with @xmath20 and @xmath16 , respectively , and the gates @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( the fourier matrix ) are defined by @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes @xmath26 , so @xmath27 . the symbols resembling `` d '' in fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] represent measurements in the standard basis .",
    "the slow protocol proceeds by alice carrying out the operations indicated on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] , and then sending the outcome @xmath28 of the measurement on @xmath18 to bob over a classical channel .",
    "he uses it to carry out a gate @xmath29 , followed by the other operations in the center of the figure .",
    "his final measurement outcome @xmath30 is sent to alice over another classical channel , who uses it to perform an additional gate @xmath31 that completes the protocol .",
    "a faster protocol can be constructed if the two rounds of classical communication can be carried out simultaneously instead of consecutively .",
    "this is possible if bob can carry out various operations , including a measurement , in advance of receiving the value of @xmath28 from alice , as in fig .",
    "the classical signals can then be sent simultaneously , and the protocol is completed when both alice and bob make final corrections that depend on the signals they receive . in order to change the slow protocol into a fast protocol , one must , in effect , push the @xmath29 gate in fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] through the two gates that follow it in order to arrive at the situation in fig .",
    "the two steps are as follows :    1 .",
    "commute @xmath29 with the controlled-@xmath32 gate : the @xmath29 itself passes through the control node unchanged , but leaves the @xmath33 gate controlled by state @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 , so @xmath36 instead of @xmath32 acts on @xmath16 .",
    "this can be compensated at the end of the protocol by a local unitary correction of @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "2 .   commute @xmath29 with @xmath23 : we have that @xmath39 , and since the @xmath40 are diagonal unitaries , they do not affect the measurement result @xmath30 in the standard basis , and thus @xmath40 is absent from the fast protocol in fig .",
    "( due to the removal of @xmath40 there is an unimportant global phase , dependent on @xmath28 and @xmath30 , that is introduced in the implementation of @xmath41 . )",
    "the final correction @xmath42 is possible because the @xmath4 form a cyclic group : the net operation on @xmath16 is @xmath43 , where @xmath38 follows from fig .  [ fgr1 ] and the definition of the @xmath29 gate .",
    "this is an extra restriction over the slow protocol , where the @xmath32 can be arbitrary unitaries .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "*    case ( i ) .",
    "@xmath41 is the @xmath8-dimensional cnot gate , with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 form a cyclic group .",
    "this is the class of unitaries implementable by dang and fan s protocol shown in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "case ( ii ) .",
    "@xmath41 is a controlled unitary of the form with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "( the @xmath32 are not shift operators , so this is more general than the protocol in @xcite . )",
    "the fast protocol for controlled - cyclic - group unitaries is easily generalized to the case where the @xmath32 in form an ordinary representation of an abelian group @xmath7 of order @xmath8 .",
    "again it suffices ( appendix  [ sbct_control_rank ] ) to consider the case where the @xmath0 are rank 1 projectors .",
    "any finite abelian group is the direct sum ( direct product ) of @xmath50 cycles , and it is convenient to adopt a label @xmath51 for elements of @xmath7 that reflects this structure , by thinking of it as an @xmath50-tuple of integers , @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the length of the @xmath55-th cycle . in this way group multiplication , with @xmath56 the identity , is the same as vector addition , modulo @xmath54 for the @xmath55-th component .",
    "similarly , the @xmath57 labels on the systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 in fig",
    ".  [ fgr2 ] , and the measurement outcomes @xmath28 and @xmath30 , can also written as @xmath50-tuples : @xmath58 , etc . in the following",
    "we will make use of the inner product of two @xmath50-tuples such as @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 gates are now appropriate tensor products of the cyclic group gates in , for example , @xmath60 understood as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , using the obvious @xmath50-tuple definition of @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath64 gate in fig .",
    "[ fgr2 ] is the tensor product of the @xmath65 gates for the different cycles , @xmath66    here is why the protocol works .",
    "assume an initial product state @xmath67 on @xmath68 .",
    "then the operator implemented on @xmath16 is @xmath69 . the @xmath23 gate on @xmath19 before the measurement gives rise to a phase @xmath70 , which is partially compensated by the phase @xmath71 in the @xmath64 gate on @xmath20 , and since @xmath72 , we are left with an overall phase of @xmath73 .",
    "since this phase is independent of @xmath51 , a superposition of initial product states of this form for different @xmath51 will also be transformed by @xmath41 , up to an overall phase that is of no concern .",
    "note that the @xmath32 themselves may , but need not , be tensor products , as illustrated in the following example .",
    "* example 2 .",
    "*    case ( i ) : @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath32 defined by @xmath75 are tensor products , and form a group @xmath76 . if one regards @xmath2 as well as @xmath5 as a tensor product of two qubits , the @xmath41 defined by is itself a tensor product @xmath77 , with each factor a controlled - cyclic group unitary with one qubit on the @xmath20 and the other on the @xmath16 side .",
    "thus @xmath41 can be implemented by an overall protocol which is just two smaller protocols running in parallel with each other , one for @xmath78 and the other for @xmath79 .",
    "case ( ii ) : @xmath80 . modify the @xmath32 in by keeping only the first three rows and columns , so they are no longer tensor products , though they still form a group @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , the protocol that carries out @xmath41 can no longer be viewed as two smaller protocols running in parallel .",
    "assume that the @xmath4 in form an ordinary representation of an abelian group of order @xmath8 , but the sum over @xmath51 is restricted to some subset @xmath11 of the set of @xmath8 @xmath50-tuples defined in the last subsection .",
    "it will suffice once again to consider the case of rank - one projectors , i.e. , .",
    "the @xmath57 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fgr2 ] run over the same range as before , but @xmath51 is restricted to the set @xmath11 . therefore the dimension @xmath81 of @xmath2 is less than the schmidt rank of @xmath82 , which is the order @xmath8 of the group .",
    "it is convenient to use the elements of @xmath11 to label the kets that form the basis of @xmath2 in [ corresponding to the projectors in ] .",
    "the operator @xmath64 is now given by , but with @xmath51 restricted to @xmath11 .",
    "the reason that the fast protocol in fig .",
    "[ fgr2 ] will work in this case is the same as given above in sec .",
    "[ sbct2.2 ] ; the fact that @xmath51 is restricted to a subset makes no difference .    the significance of this extension of the result in sec .",
    "[ sbct2.2 ] is that it enlarges the class of fast unitaries that can be carried out using a protocol of this sort , though perhaps with a significant increase in the entanglement cost .",
    "this is illustrated by the following example , which shows that in certain cases one can approximate a continuous family of unitaries using sufficient entanglement ( a large enough @xmath8 ) .",
    "* example 3 .",
    "*    consider a unitary on two qubits @xmath20 and @xmath16 of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 for some integer @xmath85 . by relabeling @xmath86 on @xmath20 as @xmath87",
    ", we see that is of the form with @xmath51 in the sum restricted to the two values in @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath41 can be carried out in a fast way at an entanglement cost of @xmath89 ebits . in general , any two - qubit controlled unitary is of the form ( up to local unitaries on @xmath20 and @xmath16 , before and after @xmath41 ) with @xmath90 for some real number @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath91 can be approximated by @xmath92 multiplied by a rational number @xmath93 with large enough @xmath8 , any two - qubit controlled unitary can be approximately implemented ( up to local unitaries ) using this fast protocol by setting @xmath94 equal to @xmath95 for suitable @xmath30 and @xmath8 ; the entanglement cost is again @xmath89 ebits .",
    "a further generalization to arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath6 is possible for any unitary @xmath41 which is diagonal in a product of bases , a basis on @xmath2 and another on @xmath5 .",
    "when such a diagonal @xmath41 is written in the form , the unitaries @xmath32 are diagonal .",
    "each diagonal element of @xmath32 is approximately an integer root of unity , hence each @xmath32 is approximately an integer root of the identity operator , and the whole set @xmath4 can be approximated by a subset of an ordinary representation of an abelian group of sufficient size .",
    "thus any bipartite unitary diagonal in a product of bases can be approximately implemented by a fast protocol .",
    "in this section we consider a fast protocol for `` double - group '' unitaries of the form @xmath96 where @xmath7 is a group of order @xmath8 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are unitaries on hilbert spaces @xmath2 and @xmath5 of dimension @xmath3 and @xmath6 , respectively , and the operators @xmath99 form a projective representation of @xmath7 , in the sense that @xmath100 the collection @xmath101 of complex numbers of unit magnitude is known as the factor system . similarly , @xmath102 and @xmath103 each form a projective unitary representation of @xmath7 with individual factor systems which may differ from one another , whose product for a given @xmath104 and @xmath105 is @xmath106 . from sec .",

    "alice and bob perform controlled-@xmath97 and controlled-@xmath98 gates on @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "alice follows this with a @xmath112 gate on @xmath18 , where in the standard basis @xmath112 is a complex hadamard matrix @xmath113 divided by @xmath114 , that is , a unitary with all elements of the same magnitude @xmath115 .",

    "bob carries out a @xmath116 gate on @xmath19 , where each @xmath116 is a diagonal unitary matrix whose diagonal elements are the complex conjugates of those in the @xmath28-th row of @xmath113 .",
    "thus @xmath112 and @xmath116 generalize the fourier gate @xmath23 and the @xmath40 gate in our previous paper @xcite .",

    "this completes the argument for an ordinary representation .",
    "when the @xmath306 form a projective representation of @xmath7 with a standard factor system , the first row in is the same , but the second row will be multiplied by appropriate factors @xmath106 . since we are assuming a normalized factor system , all these additional factors are themselves @xmath8-th roots of 1 , so still holds for @xmath301 which are @xmath8-th roots of 1 , and the rest of the argument is the same as before .",
