    "the first 21 cm line detection of an extragalactic source ( the magellanic clouds ) was achieved by kerr & hindman ( 1953 ) with a 36foot transit telescope just over half a century ago .",
    "the construction of large , single dish radio telescopes produced seminal discoveries in the decade of the 1960s , as illustrated in the fundamental paper of that period ( roberts 1975 ) .",
    "a decade later , the completion of the very large array ( vla ) and of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope , the resurfacing of the arecibo dish and rapid progress in detector and spectrometer technology made it possible for hi spectroscopy to achieve order of magnitude improvements in terms of sensitivity and resolution .",
    "new scientific problems became accessible , and extragalactic hi line research underwent a phase of rapid growth .",
    "the study of rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter in spiral galaxies ; the potential of the luminosity  linewidth relation as a cosmological tool became apparent ; the impact of tidal interactions and of the intracluster medium on galaxy evolution was illustrated in great detail through measures of the hi emission .",
    "the 21 cm line was found to be an expedient tool to determine accurate galaxy redshifts , playing an important role in confirming the filamentary nature of the large  scale structure of the universe .",
    "the application of the luminosity  linewidth relation led to accurate estimates of cosmological parameters and to the characterization of the peculiar velocity field in the local universe .",
    "highly sensitive measurements in the peripheries of disk galaxies revealed edges in their visible components , and a number of optically inert objects was discovered .    until a few years ago , however , comprehensive wide angle surveys of the extragalactic hi sky were unavailable . at the close of the last decade ,",
    "the advent of multifeed front ",
    "end systems at l  band finally made possible the efficient coverage of large sections of the extragalactic sky .",
    "the first such system to be used for that purpose was installed on the 64  m parkes telescope in australia , and has produced the excellent results of the hipass survey ( barnes  2001 ; meyer  2004 ) .",
    "a second 4-feed system on the 76  m lovell telescope at jodrell bank produced the hijass ( lang  2003 ) survey .",
    "the 1990s upgrade of the arecibo telescope , which replaced its line feeds with a gregorian subreflector system , made it possible for that telescope to host feed arrays , as proposed by kildal  ( 1993 ) .",
    "eventually built and installed at arecibo in 2004 , this 7-beam radio `` camera '' , named alfa ( arecibo l  band feed array ) , is now operational , enabling large  scale mapping projects with the great sensitivity of the 305m telescope .",
    "a diverse set of mapping projects are now underway , ranging from extragalactic hi line , to galactic line and continuum , to pulsar searches . here",
    ", we introduce one of these newly - initiated surveys , specifically designed to map approximately one fifth of the sky in the hi line , out to a distance of 250 mpc .",
    "the survey , currently underway at arecibo , is referred to as alfalfa , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey .    as illustrated in figure [ skycov ]",
    ", alfalfa aims to cover 7074  of the high galactic latitude sky between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in declination , requiring a total of 4130 hours of telescope time . exploiting the large collecting area of the arecibo antenna and its relatively small beam size ( @xmath8 )",
    ", alfalfa will be nearly eight times more sensitive than hipass with @xmath0four times better angular resolution .",
    "furthermore , its spectral backend provides 3 times better spectral resolution ( 5.3  at @xmath9 ) over 1.4 times more bandwidth .",
    "these advantages , in combination with a simple observing technique designed to yield excellent baseline characteristics , flux calibration and hi signal verification , offer new opportunities to explore the extragalactic hi sky .",
    "data taking for alfalfa was initiated in february 2005 , and , in the practical context of time allocation at a widely used , multidisciplinary national facility like arecibo , completion of the full survey is projected to require 56 years .    as discussed in section [ simul ] , simulations predict that alfalfa will detect some 20,000 extragalactic hi line sources , from very nearby low mass dwarfs to massive spirals at @xmath4 . the survey is designed specifically to determine robustly the faint end of the hi mass function ( himf ) in the local universe at masses @xmath10 @xmath11 , and will at the same time provide a census of hi in the surveyed sky area , making it especially useful in synergy with other wide area surveys such as sdss , 2mass , galex , astro ",
    "f , etc . in conjunction with optical studies of comparable volumes , alfalfa will help determine the true census of low mass satellites and the widely distributed dwarf galaxy population in the local and surrounding groups .",
    "its dataset will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the local and nearby superclusters , will allow measurement of the hi diameter function , and will enable a first wide  area blind search for local hi tidal features , hi absorbers at @xmath2 and oh megamasers in the redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "survey details and status can be found by visiting its website .",
    "survey efforts of this scale and scope require careful optimization of their operational strategy towards achieving the science objectives within the constraints imposed by practical observing conditions and requirements . in this paper",
    ", we introduce the science objectives of alfalfa , the principal constraints which set its strategy and the results of survey simulations which allow prediction of its eventual results . in a companion paper ( giovanelli  2005 ; paper ii )",
    ", we present results obtained during a precursor observing run , designed to allow us to test and optimize the alfalfa strategy during the alfa commissioning phase in fall 2004 .",
    "we summarize , in section [ science ] , the main scientific motivations of the survey . technical details of the hardware are given in section [ alfa ] , while criteria leading to the design of the survey , in the form of scaling laws and survey simulations are described in section [ strategy ] .",
    "observing modes , sky tiling and data processing plans are presented in section [ tiles ] , while section [ sensitivity ] summarizes sensitivity numbers at various stages of the survey .",

    ".    -6 cm -12 cm",
    "following on the results of a number of important and sucessful previous blind hi surveys , extragalactic hi surveys with alfa will exploit arecibo s huge collecting area to explore larger volumes of the universe with greater sensitivity and higher angular and spectral resolution if they are to break new science ground . with arecibo s tremendous sensitivity and beam size advantages ,",
    "alfalfa is designed for wide areal coverage , thereby increasing the volume sampled locally , yielding a deep , precise census of hi in the local universe to the lowest hi masses .",
    "alfalfa aims to survey 7074  of sky at high galactic latitudes which lie within the declination limits of the arecibo telescope , @xmath14 decl .",
    "@xmath15 , as illustrated in figure [ skycov ] . based on simulations described in section [ simul ] and now verified by the results of the alfalfa precursor observations presented in paper ii",
    ", alfalfa is expected to yield on the order of 20,000 hi line detections , sampling a wide range of sources from local , very low hi mass dwarfs to gas - rich massive galaxies seen to @xmath16 ( @xmath0250 mpc ) .",
    "hi spectra provide redshifts , hi masses and rotational widths for normal galaxies , trace the history of tidal events with high kinematical accuracy and provide quantitative measures of the potential for future star formation via comparative hi contents . as a blind hi survey",
    ", alfalfa will not be biased towards the high surface brightness galaxies typically found in optical galaxy catalogs and moreover , in contrast to hipass and hijass , will have adequate angular and spectral resolution to be used on its own , generally without the need for follow  up observations to determine identifications , positions and , in many cases , hi sizes .",
    "the wide areal coverage of alfalfa overlaps with several other major surveys , most notably the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , 2mass and the nvss .",
    "the catalog products of alfalfa will be invaluable for multiwavelength data mining for a wide spectrum of purposes , and a key element of our overall collaborative program is to provide broad application , legacy data products that will maximize the science fallout of the alfalfa survey .",
    "a primary objective of alfalfa is the robust determination of the faint end of the hi mass function ( himf ) .",
    "the himf is the cosmic number density , per bin of hi mass , of detectable hi line signals in a survey sensitive to the global neutral hydrogen within a system .",
    "the most recent estimates of the himf based on significant numbers of galaxies have been presented by zwaan  ( 1997 , hereafter z97 ) , rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ; hereafter rs02 ) , zwaan  ( 2004 , hereafter z04 ) , zwaan  ( 2005 , hereafter z05 ) and springob  ( 2005a ) .",
    "the z04 and z05 himfs are based on the hipass survey , while the rs02 and z97 himfs are both based on surveys conducted at arecibo during the period of its recent upgrade .",
    "the faint end slope of those determinations of the himf vary between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , yielding extrapolations below  @xmath19   that disagree by an order of magnitude near @xmath20 , the rs02 himf having the steeper slope .",
    "all of the previous hi blind surveys sample a lower mass limit just below  @xmath21 .",
    "no extragalactic hi sources were detected by rs02 or z97 with @xmath22 , while 3 are claimed by z04 , and only a small number of detections have  @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the distances of those detections are highly uncertain , for they are very nearby and the impact of peculiar velocity on the observed redshift is quite large , as pointed out by masters  ( 2004 ) .",
    "thus current inferences on the behavior of the himf at low mass levels are quite unreliable , as they are based on very few objects of highly uncertain distance .    with the aim of exploring the himf at masses  @xmath23",
    ", alfalfa will cover a very large solid angle in order to survey an adequate volume at d @xmath24 20 mpc , a distance within which the low hi mass systems are detectable .",
    "as shown by the simulations described in section [ simul ] , alfalfa will detect several hundred objects with  @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , its extensive catalog of more massive objects will allow comparison of the high mass end ,  @xmath25 , in the diverse range of environments found in the volume out to 250 mpc .",
    "the arecibo sky to be surveyed by alfalfa , as shown in figure [ skycov ] includes the rich central regions of the local supercluster and the nearby low density anti - virgo region as well as a number of more distant large scale features , most notably the main ridge of the pisces - perseus supercluster and the great wall connecting the abell 1367  coma and hercules superclusters .    at the virgo distance",
    ", alfalfa should detect galaxies with hi masses as low as  @xmath26 .",
    "alfalfa will cover more than one thousand   around virgo , yielding a database of unprecedented breadth for combination with the sdss , galex and other surveys to construct a complete census of baryon bearing objects in the cluster and its full infall region .",
    "the combination of hi content , hi distribution and the derived kinematical information with other multiwavelength studies will enable detailed modelling of the relative efficiency of gas stripping mechanisms such as tides , ram pressure or galaxy harassment as the origin of gas deficiency in virgo .",
    "alfalfa s hi maps will trace intriguing hi features like the virgo `` dark cloud '' ( davies  2004 ; minchin  2005 ) , the hi `` plume '' around ngc  4388 ( oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 ) and the huge envelope surrounding ngc  4532 and ddo137 ( hoffman  1992 ) . in more quiescent regions than virgo , extensive tidal features such as the leo triplet ( haynes , giovanelli & roberts 1979 ) , and enigmatic systems such as the 200  kpc `` leo ring '' ( schneider  1983 ) may be found .",
    "alfalfa will enable the first truly blind survey for hi tidal remnants with both sufficient angular resolution and wide areal coverage to verify their nature .    while hi appendages uncover past disruptive events in galaxy evolution , extended gas disks around galaxies represent a reservoir for future star formation activity .",
    "in contrast to hipass and hijass which were limited by much poorer angular resolution ( 15.5  and 12 , respectively ) , the 3.5  beam of alfa will resolve the hi disks of @xmath0500 gas - rich galaxies , allowing a quantitative measure of their hi sizes ( hewitt  1984 ) and the derivation of the hi diameter function . in combination with optical photometry , alfalfa will determine the fraction of galaxies with extended gas disks and enable studies of their host galaxies , their environments , morphologies and the role of gas in their evolution .",
    "more extremely extended gas disks , such as those found in ddo  154 ( krumm & burstein 1984 ) , ugc  5288 ( van zee 2004 ) and ngc  3741 ( begum  2005 ) may lurk yet unidentified . because of its wide sky coverage , alfalfa will trace important high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) structures in and around the milky way , such as the northern portions of the magellanic stream and complex c at several times better spatial and spectral resolution than hipass , particularly important advantages in the case of narrow linewidth hvc cores ( giovanelli & brown 1973 ) . because of its high flux sensitivity , alfalfa will be eight times more sensitive than hipass to unresolved small clouds , or ultra - compact hvcs . while arecibo can not reach as far north as m31 , alfalfa will cover part of the region containing the clouds in its periphery identified by thilker  ( 2004 ) and their possible extension toward the region around m33 ( westmeier , braun & thilker 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to the study of hi in emission , alfalfa will provide a dataset well - suited for a blind survey of hi absorption out to @xmath27 .",
    "the background continuum source counts in the alfalfa survey region at 1.4 ghz yield over 2000 sources brighter than 0.4 jy and more than 10000 brighter than 0.1 jy .",
    "the major practical difficulty with hi line absorption studies is spectral baseline determination in the presence of standing waves .",
    "the large number of continuum sources present in the alfalfa dataset and the adopted `` drift '' technique ( section [ drift ] ) will aid in the assessment of whether a given spectral feature is real absorption .    by its combination of studies of hi emission and absorption in the local universe",
    ", alfalfa will allow a robust estimate of the local hi cross section , as well as a measure of its clustering correlation amplitude and scale .",
    "in addition to hi line studies , the frequency range of the alfalfa survey will also include , serendipitously , lines from oh megamasers ( ohm ) arising from the nuclear molecular regions in merging galaxy systems .",
    "approximately 100 such sources are known to date , half of which were discovered recently at arecibo ( e.g. darling & giovanelli 2002 ) .",
    "observations of ohms hold the potential for tracing the merger history of the universe since the sources are associated with merging galaxies .",
    "an essential tool in this exercise is the ohm luminosity funtion at low @xmath28 .",
    "alfalfa should detect several additional dozen ohms in the redshift interval 0.160.25 , and allow a more robust determination of the low @xmath28 ohm luminosity function than currently available .",
    "the construction of the gregorian subreflector system for the arecibo telescope , completed in the late 1990s , made possible the development of focal plane feed arrays ( effectively , _ creating _ a focal plane ) .",
    "this development was foreseen during the planning phases of the gregorian upgrade ( kildal 1993 ) .",
    "a seven feed array was commissioned at the observatory during 2004 .",
    "six of the seven feeds ( numbered 1 through 6 ) are physically arranged on the corners of a regular hexagon , while the seventh ( feed 0 ) is at its center , as shown in figure [ alfabeams ] .",
    "the feeds can receive dual , linear polarizations and their spectral response is optimized for the range 12251525 mhz .",
    "they are stepped te@xmath29 mode horns of 25 cm aperture , as described in cort ' es  medelln ( 2002 ) . because the optical design of the gregorian subreflectors maximizes the illuminated area of the primary by sacrificing its circular symmetry ( the illuminated area is elliptical ) , a circular pattern in the sky maps on the focal plane as an ellipse of axial ratio 1.15",
    "; reciprocally , the footprint of the centers of the outer beams of the alfa array on the sky is that of a hexagon inscribed in an ellipse of that axial ratio .",
    "similarly , the seven beams have an elliptical shape of the same axial ratio and orientation as the array pattern .",
    "the major axis of the ellipse is linked to the azimuth of the receiver , so its orientation on the sky changes with telescope configuration . in figure",
    "[ alfabeams ] the relative location of the beams is shown when the array is positioned at the meridian and rotated about its symmetry axis by @xmath30 . in this sketch ,",
    "the outlines of the beams are shown at the half ",
    "power response , for which the beam sizes are 3.3  along the azimuth direction and 3.8  along the zenith angle directon , with small variations from one beam to the other .",
    "the central beam 0 has higher gain ( @xmath31 k / jy ) than the peripheral beams 16 ( gain of @xmath32 k / jy ) , which is illustrated in the sketch by the brighter contours .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the tracks of constant declination made by each of the beams , when data is acquired in drift mode .",
    "projected on the sky , the alfa footprint in this configuration is such that beam 1 points farthest to the north and beam 2 farthest to the west , for observations south of the zenith . for observations north of the zenith , beam 1 points farthest to the south and beam 2 farthest to the east .",
    "figures [ sidelobe0 ]  and [ sidelobe6 ]   show the pattern for each of the alfa beams , obtained by mapping the radio source 3c 138 near transit .",
    "sidelobe levels are very different for each of the beams of alfa .",
    "located at the center of the array , beam 0 has the most symmetric beam pattern , with a first sidelobe ring near 15 db below the response at beam center , as shown in figure [ sidelobe0 ] .",
    "contour levels are plotted at intervals of 3 db .",
    "the outer beams have a very marked comatic aberration , as shown in figure [ sidelobe6 ] .",
    "the first sidelobe ring of the outer beams is strongly asymmetric , reaching levels near 78 db below peak response , on the section away from the array center .",
    "this feature of the system will require careful attention , especially in the analysis of data obtained in the vicinity of strong and/or extended sources .",
    "the system temperature ranges between 26 and 30 k for all beam / polarization channels , when pointing away from strong continuum sources .",
    "-5 cm -2 in    -3 cm -5 cm    the array can be rotated about its axis , centered on beam 0 , and thus the relative position of the beams on the sky can be rotated along the elliptical perimeter . in the case of drift mode observations , it is desirable to position the array in such a manner that the beam tracks are equally spaced in declination . because of the ellipticity of the array pattern on the sky , the separation between beam tracks depends on both the array rotation angle as well as on the array azimuth .",
    "when the telescope feed arm is stationed along the local meridian , the optimal array rotation angle is @xmath30 , as shown in figure [ alfabeams ] . in that case ,",
    "beam tracks are spaced 2.1  in declination .",
    "a single drift will thus sweep seven nearly equidistant tracks covering 14.5  in declination , at slightly below the nyquist sampling rate .",
    "alfalfa will map most of the extragalactic sky in drift mode with alfa stationed along the local meridian , at a local azimuth of either @xmath6 ( for observations south of zenith ) or @xmath33 ( for north of zenith ) .",
    "only declination tracks transiting within @xmath34 of the zenith will be mapped with alfa at an azimuth near @xmath35 or @xmath36 in order to avoid impractically small zenith angles .",
    "the beam separation for equidistant tracks is 1.8  at these azimuths , and thus the declination sampling will be denser , as the elliptical pattern of the sky footprint of both the array and the individual beams will have its major axis oriented nearly parallel to the drift direction .",
    "our survey will thus be done with alfa in only two sets of configurations : one for all observations between declinations @xmath6 and @xmath37 , as well as between @xmath38 and @xmath7 , with alfa on the meridian , and a second for observations between declinations @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "spectra will be recorded every second , yielding approximately 14 samples per beam in the right ascension direction .",
    "this sampling rate , which largely exceeds nyquist , is principally motivated by the advantages deriving in the identification of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "further details on alfa can be found at the naic website .",
    "alfalfa uses the feed array connected through a fiber optics if  lo system to a spectral line , digital backend consisting of a set of processors each individually referred to as a wapp ( wideband arecibo pulsar processor ) .",
    "the full spectral backend consists of four wapp units , each capable of processing the two polarization signals from two alfa beams .",
    "the wapp set can thus produce 16 autocorrelation spectra , each with a maximum bandwidth of 100 mhz , over 4096 lags .",
    "fourteen of those are matched to the seven polarization pairs from the alfa beams , and a spare pair duplicates the signal of the seventh beam . at the offline processing stage ,",
    "the extra pair of spectra are used for rfi monitoring purposes .",
    "each data record thus consists of 65,536 spectral samples ( 16 @xmath39 4096 ) . since , as mentioned above , alfalfa records data every second ,",
    "the generation of raw data by the survey is slightly over 1 gb per hour , including headers .",
    "the strategy for the alfalfa survey has been developed over the last few years , balancing the practical realities involved in using the arecibo telescope , the constraints of telescope time availability , and the principal science objectives outlined in section [ science ] .",
    "here we review the considerations that enter into the survey design and numerical simulations that have been used to refine it .",
    "the hi mass of an optically thin hi source at distance @xmath40 , in solar units , is m_hi / m_= 2.35610 ^ 5 d^2_mpc s(v ) dv , where @xmath41 is the hi line profile in jy and @xmath42 is the doppler velocity in . to first order , m_hi / m_2.410 ^ 5 d^2_mpc s_peak w_kms , where @xmath43 is the line peak flux and @xmath44 its velocity width in .",
    "for detection , the signal  to  noise ratio @xmath45 must exceed some threshold value ; @xmath46 quantifies the fraction of the source flux detected by the telescope s beam .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 for a point source , while for resolved sources , it decreases roughly like the ratio between the beam solid angle and the solid angle subtended by the source .",
    "an estimate of @xmath48 can be obtained from the radiometer equation for the rms figure s_rms = ( t_sys / g ) , where @xmath49 is the system temperature divided by the system gain ( for the alfa feeds , @xmath49 will vary between 2.65 and 3.40 jy ; here we adopt a flat value of 3.25 jy ) ; @xmath50 is the channel bandwidth in hz and @xmath51 the integration time in seconds .",
    "the factor 2 under the square root indicates that two independent polarization channels are averaged . for alfalfa , @xmath52 khz , which at the rest frequency of the hi line , is equivalent to 5.3 .",
    "the factor @xmath53 accounts for spectral smoothing of the signal , @xmath54 , the switching technique applied for bandpass subtraction , @xmath55 , and other observational details , such as autocorrelation clipping losses , i.e. @xmath56 . for the data taking scheme of alfalfa , @xmath57 .",
    "the signal  to  noise of a feature of width @xmath44 is best rendered when the noise is measured after smoothing the signal to a spectral resolution on order of @xmath58 . in practice , however , the smoothing of l  band spectra of @xmath59 several hundred does not reduce the noise in proportion to @xmath60 and , moreover , @xmath43 is depressed by such smoothing , for spectral shapes are by no means boxlike .",
    "the fact that the detection criterion described above applies well to narrow lines but not so to wider ones was also noted by rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) .",
    "we assume here that spectral smoothing will increase signal  to  noise up to a maximum @xmath61 , and that smoothing beyond that width will be ineffective in increasing @xmath62 . for a conservative signal  to  noise threshold of 6 , we can then write : 12.3 f_t_s^1/2(m_hi10 ^ 6 m _ ) d^-2_mpc ( w_kms200)^ > 6 , [ eq : sngt5 ] where @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "by inverting , we can obtain a minimum detectable hi mass ( m_hi10 ^ 6)_min = 0.49 f_^-1 d_mpc^2  t_s^-1/2 ( w_kms/200)^- . [",
    "eq : mhi ] with an integration time of 30 sec per pixel solid angle ( see section [ sensitivity ] ) or 48 sec per beam solid angle , alfalfa should thus detect an hi mass of @xmath20 @xmath11 , @xmath67 , at a distance of @xmath68 mpc , and a source of @xmath69 @xmath11 and of the same width out to @xmath70 mpc .",
    "it is useful to review some of the basic scaling relations relevant to the design of a survey :    @xmath71 the minimum integration time required to detect a source of hi mass @xmath72 and width @xmath44 at @xmath73 , at the distance @xmath40 with alfa is , from eqn .",

    "the volume sampled by one beam to the maximum distance @xmath80 is @xmath81 , i.e. in a fixed time , a radio telescope samples a * volume that scales with the reflector diameter * , yielding a significant comparative advantage for a large aperture like arecibo .",
    "@xmath71 assuming that clouds of mass @xmath72 are randomly distributed in space out to the maximum distance at which they are detectable , @xmath82 , the number of clouds detected by a survey increases linearly with the sampled volume @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the solid angle mapped by the survey .",
    "we can thus increase the number of detections either by sampling a larger solid angle @xmath84 or by increasing @xmath82 .",
    "now , the total time required to complete the survey is t_survey ( _ survey/_b ) t_s , [ eq : tsurvey ] where @xmath85 is the telescope beam . since @xmath86 , as shown in equation [ eq : ts ] , we can write v_survey(m_hi ) _ survey [ d_max(m_hi)]^3 _ survey t_s^3/4 t_survey t_s^-1/4 , and inverting : t_survey v_survey(m_hi ) d_max(m_hi ) v_survey(m_hi ) t_s^1/4 .",
    "[ eq : tsurvey2 ] to achieve a given surveyed volume @xmath87 , once @xmath72 is detectable at an astrophysically interesting distance , * it is more advantageous to maximize @xmath88 than to increase the depth of the survey @xmath82*.    the scaling relations described above provide only general guidelines in the design of a survey .",
    "other considerations can and will play important roles in the survey strategy .",
    "for example , the growing impact of rfi on hi spectroscopy dictates increased attention to signal identification and corroboration , recommending a survey with more than a single pass over a given region of sky , as we discuss in section [ 2pass ]",
    ". the determination of specific properties of galaxies or systems may drive towards deeper surveys of narrow solid angle regions , as planned for other alfa surveys with the arecibo telescope , the goals and products of which will be complementary to alfalfa .",
    "the scaling relations described above dictate that alfalfa cover a very large solid angle . in practice , the survey design must weigh the desire to cover a wide area with the need for sensitivity .",
    "an indispensable aid in the design of a survey is a thorough examination of expectations , _ vis  a  vis _ variance over the survey parameter space . to this end , we have carried out an extensive set of survey simulations to help in the design of alfalfa and present a sample of the results in this section .",
    "the main ingredients for our survey simulation are : ( i ) the survey mode and sensitivity parameters , deriving from the instrument configuration ; ( ii ) an estimate of the space density of sources given by an adopted himf ; ( iii ) an understanding of the clustering properties and deviations from smooth hubble flow in the local universe .",
    "sensitivity considerations were presented in section [ scaling ] . for the himf ,",
    "we use two recent estimates which differ strongly from each other at the low mass end : that of z97 and that of rs02 . the more recent himfs by z04 and springob ( 2005a ) are bracketed by those of z97 and rs02 .",
    "we use a density map of the local universe provided by branchini ( 1999 ) , which is a density reconstruction derived from the pscz catalog .",
    "the grid we used has a spacing of 0.9375 @xmath89 mpc in the inner 60 @xmath89 mpc , and a spacing twice that value between 60 and 120 @xmath89 mpc , where @xmath90 ; the map is smoothed with a gaussian filter of @xmath91 mpc . for distances larger than 120 @xmath89 mpc , we assume a constant density .",
    "sources are seeded using the density map and , separately , each of the two himfs .",
    "the hi gas is assumed to be optically thin . because many of the sources will be resolved by the arecibo beam ,",
    "an estimate of hi sizes is necessary . assuming that the hi distribution is disk  like , inclinations to the line of sight and linewidths need to be assigned to each source .",
    "we use empirical scaling relations obtained from our own hi survey data ( springob 2005b ) and broeils & rhee ( 1997 ) , we add random inclinations , realistic scatter and broad  band spectral baseline instability . with these recipes ,",
    "we have inspected a wide grid of survey parameters in arriving at the adopted alfalfa survey strategy .",
    "-3 cm -4 cm    as an example , figure [ him_d ] displays the variation with distance of the hi mass of expected detections within the region of the alfalfa sky coverage , as described in section [ tiles ] , adopting as input the two different himfs : the z97 himf ( panel a ) and the rs02 ( panel b ) .",
    "only expected detections out to 150 mpc are shown .",
    "the simulation corresponds to an integration time @xmath92 seconds per map pixel solid angle .",
    "the number of detections expected with rs02 is 22,200 , while the number expected with z97 is 15,022 , with a detection threshold of @xmath93 , as defined in section [ scaling ] .",
    "the difference in expected detections is more dramatic when the hi mass of the source is restricted to  @xmath94 . in that case , we expect 1400 detections with rs02 and only 249 with z97 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in the course of alfalfa precursor observations , reported in the companion paper ii , three objects with  @xmath95  were detected .",
    "albeit of still marginal statistical value , that rate is consistent with the high end of the expectations ( rs02 himf ) obtained from the simulations reported here .",
    "three curves are inset in the panels of figure [ him_d ] : the two solid lines are the loci of constant integrated hi line flux of 0.9 and 1.25 jy , respectively .",
    "the lowest of the two corresponds to the completeness limit of the survey for sources of @xmath96 ( detections below that line correspond to sources of smaller width ) .",
    "the second curve corresponds to completeness limit for sources of the same width , for an integration time per pixel of @xmath97 seconds .",
    "such an integration time applies to the analysis of individual drift tracks , without the corroborating support ( and higher resulting integration ) of spectra in beam tracks at neighboring declinations .",
    "this detection limit would result if source extraction would be carried out , for example , right after data taking , and before an entire data cube ( spatially two  dimensional , plus one spectral dimension ) is available . in this case , the expected number of detections would be 13,804 for the rs02 himf , and 9601 for the z97 case , a drop of respectively 38% and 36% from the previous set of numbers .",
    "the decrease in the number of detections with small hi masses would be more severe if signal extraction were applied to individual tracks only , rather than to full maps : in that case , only fewer than half of the sources would be detected in the rs02 case , and just above half in the z97 case .",
    "the topmost ( dashed ) curve inset in figure [ him_d ] corresponds to a flux integral of 6.8 jy , the hipass completeness limit at the 6@xmath98 level , for detection of sources of width @xmath99 ; this is the hipass analog of the lowest of the two solid lines for alfalfa .",
    "it uses a hipass limit of 13.3 mjy per map pixel area , as reported by barnes ( 2001 ) .",
    "this provides a good graphical illustration of the comparison between the two surveys .",
    "figure [ aitoffa ] shows the sky distribution of the detected sources by an alfalfa  like survey , in the simulation with the z97 himf .",
    "sources at all right ascensions are plotted , albeit alfalfa will only cover 60% of the full r.a . range . in the lower panel , only the detections with  @xmath94  are plotted .",
    "figure [ aitoffb ] shows the analogous graphs for the rs02 himf .",
    "-5 cm -15 cm    -5 cm -15 cm    simulations results such as those presented here aid us in the estimate of the statistical efficacy of the survey data , most importantly in the determination of the faint end of the hims and the clustering properties of the new detections .",
    "given the science objectives outlined in section [ science ] and the scaling relations and simulations presented in the preceding section , the final consideration of the survey design strategy takes into account more telescope - related practicalities . in this section ,",
    "we review those issues which have led us to adopt a very simple observing strategy , a two - pass drift scan mode , covering the sky with `` tiles '' extending from @xmath100 .",
    "the arecibo telescope is an altitude  azimuth system located at a latitude near 18@xmath101 .",
    "its gregorian dome can be steered within @xmath102 of the zenith , but the system gain and performance degrades rapidly at zenith angles above @xmath103 .",
    "in general , the performance characteristics including beamwidth , pointing accuracy , sidelobe levels , spectral baseline stability and susceptibility to rfi vary with both azimuth , zenith angle and feed rotation angle . furthermore , the alfa footprint on the sky and its beams structure vary likewise in a complicated manner .",
    "the design of alfa surveys is thus strongly constrained by this variance , and with it , the corresponding degree of calibration complexity a particular observing program can endure .",
    "alfalfa aims to minimize the impact of these factors on performance through a choice of maximum simplicity in the observing mode and minimal electronic intrusion at the detection level .",
    "as mentioned previously in section [ alfa ] , the alfalfa survey is thus being carried out in a fixed azimuth drift mode . for most of the survey",
    ", the azimuth arm of the telescope is stationed along the local meridian , the zenith angle of alfa determining the declination to be mapped .",
    "a tiny elevation readjustment is periodically applied to maintain drift tracks at constant j2000.0 , rather than current declination . without such adjustment",
    ", drift tracks taken few years apart would noticeably diverge from one another .",
    "no firing of noise calibration diodes is done during normal data acquisition .",
    "rather , data taking is interrupted very briefly every 10 minutes while a calibration noise diode is fired for 1 second .",
    "this interruption produces data gaps of 5 seconds  approximately 1/3 of a beamwidth in r.a .",
    " in each 600 second drift data stream .",
    "the central frequency of the bandpass is set and never changed during an observing session , i.e. no doppler tracking of the local oscillator frequency is applied ( realignment to a common heliocentric reference frame is applied to each spectrum off line , using high precision time , position and earth s motion stamps updated every second in data headers ) . with no moving telescope parts , constant gain and nearly constant system temperature along a drift are obtained ; standing waves will change slowly , as driven by the sidereal rate ; beam characteristics remain fixed ; bandpass subtraction is optimized .    the solid angle mapped by the survey is subdivided into `` tiles '' of @xmath104 in declination ( see below and figure [ skycov ] ) extending from dec.=@xmath6 to @xmath7 . for 8 of the 9 bands of tiles , the azimuth of the feed array is along the local meridian ( at azimuth either @xmath6 or @xmath33 ) while the rotation angle of the feed array is fixed at 19@xmath101 , yielding tracks for the seven array beams that are equally spaced in declination . in order to map the telescope s `` zone of avoidance '' near zenith , the band of tiles centered at dec.=@xmath105 will require a different orientation : with the azimuth arm nearly e - w .",
    "this strategy greatly simplifies the disentangling of main beam and sidelobe contributions to the maps : characterization of alfa parameters thus needs to be made on a greatly reduced volume of telescope configuration parameter space .",
    "drift mode observations , combined with the calibration scheme described above , yield maximally efficient use of telescope time , providing high photometric quality with very small overhead .",
    "we expect that , bar instrumental malfunctions , telescope time usage for science data will approach 97% .",
    "as discussed in section [ scaling ] , the volume sampled at any hi mass limit , for a survey of fixed total duration , varies with the integration time per point as @xmath106 . once a threshold sensitivity is reached , it is more advantageous to increase the solid angle of the survey than its depth . because of the spacing of the alfa beam tracks in drift mode discussed in section [ alfa ] , coverage of the sky in a one  pass drift survey is slightly worse than nyquist . for a fixed amount of observing time , a single pass strategy would appear to maximize the number of detected sources .",
    "for a fixed total survey time , the loss of survey volume sampled by going from a one  pass to a two  pass drift survey is , according to section [ scaling ] , 19% .",
    "several advantages of a two  pass strategy offset that loss , however : ( 1 ) a second pass will greatly aid the separation of cosmic emission from rfi which is unlikely to affect each pass identically ; ( 2 ) the denser sky sampling will allow statistical separation of spurious signals from cosmic ones , thus allowing reliable detection to lower values of s / n ; ( 3 ) if the two passes are made when the earth is at very different phases of its orbit , confirmation of cosmic nature for detection candidates can be obtained by verifying that they are separated in topocentric radial velocity by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the change in the angle between the line of sight to the detection candidate and the velocity vector of earth on its heliocentric orbit ; this requires that the second pass be undertaken 3 to 9 months after the first pass , modulo a year ; ( 4 ) the variability of radio continuum sources can be measured , and radio transients can be identified , allowing commensality with other science teams interested in studies of those phenomena ; ( 5 ) given design features of the alfa hardware , maintenance will be difficult and , as a result , alfa may operate at less than 100% capacity ( i.e. one or more beams may be unusable ) during some fraction of the time .",
    "loss of a beam in a single  pass survey would result in grievous holes in sky coverage , whereas a two  pass strategy would greatly attenuate the resulting damage to the survey . for all these reasons , the high galactic latitude arecibo sky to be mapped by alfalfa will be covered in two drift passes .",
    "the resulting effective integration time of the survey , per beam area , will be about 48 seconds .",
    "another way of expressing the sensitivity of the survey is in terms of the integration time per , which will be about 14,700 seconds .",
    "as shown in figure [ skycov ] , the sky to be mapped by alfalfa extends between @xmath109 and over two blocks of right ascension , respectively @xmath110 to @xmath111 and @xmath112 to @xmath113 , although the vagaries of telescope time allocation will produce some irregularities in the survey solid angle boundaries .",
    "the exclusion of the low galactic latitude regions within the telescope s horizon is driven by ( a ) the realistic assessment that pulsar and other galactic alfa surveys will greatly increase the pressure on low galactic latitude lsts and ( b ) the expectation that part of the low galactic latitude , extragalactic sky will be surveyed commensally with pulsar and other galactic surveys .    for bookkeeping and data release purposes , the sky mapped by alfalfa",
    "will be subdivided into 378 _ tiles _ , each of @xmath114 in r.a . and",
    "@xmath104 in dec .",
    "mapping a tile in single ",
    "pass drift mode requires 17 drifts of alfa , spaced @xmath115  in dec . and",
    "each yielding 7 drift tracks ; equally as many additional drifts are required to complete the second pass at a later time .",
    "for the second pass , beam tracks will be interleaved with those of the first pass , so that the final declination sampling will be @xmath116 , better than nyquist .",
    "in order to minimize `` scalloping '' of the gain over the map introduced by the higher gain of central beam relative to the outer ones , the second pass drifts are offset by 718  relative to the first pass tracks .",
    "the data processing environment chosen for alfalfa is idl .",
    "a substantial body of spectral line software generated by one of us ( pp ) already exists at the arecibo observatory .",
    "further development specific to alfalfa has been grafted on this fertile base .",

    "hr , and upon conversion from its raw fits format to an idl structure , a single 600 sec drift is @xmath118 mb .",
    "such a data block is well suited for one of the most computer intensive parts of the reduction pipeline , that of bandpass subtraction .",
    "the data for a full tile , after polarization averaging and regridding , can fit within the 24 gb memory of current low ",
    "cost desktops .    the data processing path for alfalfa data can be summarized as follows :    * one fits file per 600record drift is generated by the data taking software at the arecibo observatory . by the end of each observing session ,",
    "each of those is converted into an idl structure , a ` drift ' structure , and stored for further analysis at the observatory and the observers institutions . * within weeks",
    ", all data of an observing session is noise  calibrated and a bandpass solution is computed .",
    "the `` bandpassed '' , calibrated and baselined spectral data for each beam / polarization configuration are obtained as output of an automated pipeline that is designed to preserve not only small angular scale features such as external galaxies , but also large structures such as hvcs and galactic hi .",
    "* the first detailed visual inspection of the data follows , in the course of which the observer flags regions of each position  velocity map for rfi and other occurrences of data corruption .",
    "it is anticipated that as much as about half of all sources to be detected by alfalfa will be visible to the eye at this stage .",
    "a first automated signal extraction algorithm pass will produce a list of candidate detections . noise diode  calibrated , bandpass  corrected , baselined and rfi  flagged spectra as obtained to this stage constitute what we shall refer to as _",
    "level i data products_. * upon completion of the second pass through a given sky tile , data will be re  calibrated using the continuum sources present within the tile , regridding of the sky sampling will take place , after smoothing by a homogenoeus resolution kernel and conversion into data cubes will follow .",
    "the output of this processing stage shall be referred to as _ level ii data products_.    because telescope scheduling is a dynamic process which responds to proposal pressure at a national center , the scheduling of data releases far in advance is not possible .",
    "however , the alfalfa observing status is continuously updated at the survey website . observing plans",
    "foresee completion by bands of tiles and , when an accurate prediction of the completion is available , data release plans for that band will be posted .",
    "data release will take place through an alfalfa / hi node connected to the u.s",
    ". national virtual observatory .",
    "a preliminary example of web  based data presentation is linked to the aforementioned website as well as directly reachable : it allows access to the spectral line data , images of optical counterparts and parameter tabulation of the precursor observations results discussed in paper ii .    as an example of a level i data product and the potential of the alfalfa survey , figure [ n3628 ] shows a single pass drift across the galaxy ngc  3628 , one of the leo triplet galaxies , and its tidal tail . the displayed position ",

    "here we summarize the sensitivity of alfalfa at several survey levels :    * a 1second record of a drift scan , after accumulation of both polarizations , will yield a spectrum of @xmath120 mjy , where @xmath121 is the spectral resolution in . * a single drift , position ",

    "* the 6@xmath98 hi column density limit will be @xmath125 atoms @xmath126 , for a spectral line of width @xmath127 , observed with a spectral resolution of @xmath121 .",
    "column density sensitivity is , in general , independent of telescope size , and thus alfalfa will not reach deeper @xmath128 levels than previous wide angle surveys such as hipass .",
    "in fact , given the shorter integration time per beam area , alfalfa will have lower sensitivity to @xmath128 than did hipass for very extended sources .",
    "it may be argued that only surveys with longer integration times per beam area than hipass can break new ground .",
    "however , this argument holds true only if sources are well resolved by the telescope beam .",
    "the beam area of arecibo is nearly _ 20 times smaller _ than that of the parkes telescope .",
    "if sources are unresolved by the beam , the telescope can only detect total flux , and the observation can not be used for any inference on source column density .",
    "in fact , very few extragalactic hi sources were resolved by the parkes beam ; the smaller arecibo beam size gives alfalfa a major advantage .",
    "to illustrate this point , figure [ sizehis ] shows two histograms of the angular size distribution of optically selected , catalogued galaxies : the upper one for galaxies known to be within the alfalfa survey region , the lower one for galaxies in the whole of the southern hemisphere .",
    "the optical size used for this comparison is d@xmath129 as catalogued in the third revised catalog of galaxies ( de vaucouleurs  1991 ) .",
    "it is well established that , on average , the hi size ( measured at the level near 1 m@xmath130 pc@xmath131 ) of optically selected galaxies is about 1.6 times that blue size ( broeils & rhee 1997 ) , although for dwarf irregular systems that ratio may rise significantly ( swaters 2002 ) . even allowing for a small number of extremely large hi - to - optical size ratios , the total number of galaxies resolved by the parkes telescope beam over the whole of the southern sky is on the order of a dozen or two . only for those ,",
    "the magellanic stream and high velocity clouds is column density sensitivity of any relevance for hipass .",
    "the alfalfa survey should , on the other hand , resolve several hundred galaxies and high velocity clouds , and map their peripheries to a column density limit of the order of @xmath132 atoms @xmath126 . through careful analysis of the hi mapping datasets including consideration of the impact of sidelobe contamination in the two or three selected telescope configurations adopted for the drift survey",

    "the effectiveness of part ( b ) will depend on the spatial sampling density and , in the case of multiple drifts through the same region , on the temporal consistency of the data .",
    "these comparisons will help exclude many marginal candidate detections of non  cosmic origin , which we shall refer to as `` false '' candidates .",

    "will that reduce the overhead of slew motions and settle time , but it will also allow for a running mean bandpass to be accumulated over a few contiguous staring observations , as the telescope configuration would change little between adjacent source candidates . in that case , allowing for slew and settle time , a corroborating observation of a single source will require on order of one to two minutes of telescope time .",
    "the steeply rising fraction of ` false ' sources with decreasing @xmath62 suggests that corroborating observations requesting single pixel telescope time at the level of approximately 10% of the request proposed for the alfa observations will deliver optimal returns .",
    "alfalfa uses the new 7-beam arecibo l - band feed array to carry out a wide area survey of the high galactic latitude sky visible from arecibo .",
    "in addition to the all  important sensitivity advantage that accrues from using arecibo , the world s most sensitive radio telescope at l  band , alfa offers important and significant improvements in angular and spectral resolution over the available major wide area extragalactic hi line surveys such as hipass and hijass .",
    "alfalfa is intended to produce an extensive database of hi spectra that will be of use to a broad community of investigators , including many interested in the correlative mining of multiwavelength datasets .",
    "it is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the himf in the very local universe .    as a result of practical considerations and simulations of survey efficiency",
    ", alfalfa exploits a simple fixed - azimuth drift scanning  _ minimum intrusion _  technique .",
    "a two  pass strategy will greatly aid in the rejection of spurious signals and rfi , thus minimizing the need for follow - up confirmation observations , evening out the scalloping in the maps that arises from unequal pixel gain , and offering the opportunity to use the same dataset for the statistical characterization of continuum transients .",
    "initial tests of the hardware , software and survey observing mode , conducted in fall 2004 during the alfa commissioning phase as described in paper ii confirm the efficacy of the planned approach .",
    "the basic parameters of the alfalfa survey can be summarized accordingly as follows :    * sky coverage of 7074 , between @xmath6 and @xmath173 in declination , 7.5 to 16.5 and 22.0 to 3.0 hrs in right ascension , with 3.5  spatial resolution .",
    "* frequency coverage between 1335 and 1435 mhz , yielding coverage of extragalactic hi in redshift out to @xmath174 , with 5.3 maximum spectral resolution . * sensitivity of @xmath175 mjy per beam area , where @xmath121 is the spectral resolution in . * on order of 20,000 hi sources",
    "are expected to be detected by the survey .",
    "extragalactic hi sources with  @xmath176  will be detectable to a distance of 6.5 mpc , while hi masses  @xmath177 , will be detectable throughout most of the local supercluster , including the virgo cluster and out to 20 mpc .",
    "several hundreds will have  @xmath5 , thus allowing a robust determination of the faint end of the himf . *",
    "public access data products will be produced on a continuing basis as subsets ( tiles ) of the overall survey are completed .",
    "observations for alfalfa started in february 2005 , and completion of the survey is expected to take five to six years .",
    "cataloguing a complete census of hi locally , pinning down the himf to the lowest masses and conducting the blind hi absorption and oh megamaser surveys will require completion of the full 5-year program , but even the initial 2005 allocation promises early science results in several important areas including : the mapping of nearly 1600 , more than 3 times the coverage with twice the sensitivity of the arecibo dual beam survey ( rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) ; a first blind census across the virgo cluster region with a detection limit of m@xmath178  at the cluster distance ( assuming a width w = 30 ) ; a complete search for hvcs around m33 ; the identification of gas - rich galaxies in the ngc  784 and leo  i groups ; the mapping of the environments of 12 gas - rich galaxies with d@xmath179 7 ; and a first attempt at a large blind survey for hi absorbers .",

    "<S> the recently initiated arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey aims to map @xmath0 7000  of the high galactic latitude sky visible from arecibo , providing a hi line spectral database covering the redshift range between -1600 and 18,000 with @xmath1  resolution . exploiting arecibo s large collecting area and small beam size </S>",
    "<S> , alfalfa is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the hi mass function in the local universe and will provide a census of hi in the surveyed sky area to faint flux limits , making it especially useful in synergy with wide area surveys conducted at other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> alfalfa will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the local and nearby superclusters , will allow measurement of the hi diameter function , and enable a first wide - area blind search for local hi tidal features , hi absorbers at @xmath2 and oh megamasers in the redshift range @xmath3 . although completion of the survey will require some five years , public access to the alfalfa data and data products will be provided in a timely manner , thus allowing its application for studies beyond those targeted by the alfalfa collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> alfalfa adopts a two - pass , minimum intrusion , drift scan observing technique which samples the same region of sky at two separate epochs to aid in the discrimination of cosmic signals from noise and terrestrial interference . </S>",
    "<S> survey simulations , which take into account large scale structure in the mass distribution and incorporate experience with the alfa system gained from tests conducted during its commissioning phase , suggest that alfalfa will detect on the order of 20,000 extragalactic hi line sources out to @xmath4 , including several hundred with hi masses  @xmath5 . </S>"
