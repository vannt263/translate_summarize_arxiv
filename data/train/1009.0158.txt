    "moreover , @xmath5 decreases with increasing doping and vanishes in highly od samples . these and others experiments have been recently interpreted ( see ref . [ ] and references therein ) in terms of that the pg phase is distint to sc , ended at the quatum critical point ( qcp ) , and its fluctuations as the responsible for pairing and transport properties .",
