    "photons within shell volume @xmath11 contribute to the pulse shape between received times , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . as a result of the relativistic motion of the shell , the volume of emitting material which contributes to the received signal at any time is constant . emitting patches on the shell which fall between the two ellipsoids labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 will arrive at the detector within this range of received time .",

    "these models enabled further testing to examine the possibility of additional dependencies which were not included in the original kinematic code .",
    "models explored jetting the model emission into an opening angle between 0.1 - 5.0 degrees and allowing for intrinsic angular dependencies of the lorentz factor and/or @xmath2 across the skullcap .",
    "off - axis shell collisions were simulated such that the collision time was not instantaneous in the rest frame of the central engine and the initial photon emission occurred at an angle outside the critical beaming angle .",
    "various thicknesses were applied to the emitting shell but this only proved to distort the rise time of the pulse and did not have any effect on the shape of the pulse decay or the @xmath5 relationship .",
    "models also explored fast and slow cooling mechanisms .",
    "generally , it was found that the curvature dependence is fairly difficult to break , and requires either grossly distorted geometries and/or relatively long cooling time scales .     decay with observed @xmath5 decay from batse pulses .",
    "the solid line represents the @xmath5 decay index demanded by colliding shells .",
    "curvature and special relativity impose such a relationship because later portions of the pulse arrive from off - axis emission .",
    "this results in an expected decay index of @xmath3 .",
    "the majority of batse observations lie below the solid line therefore indicating that observed @xmath5 decay is slower than the decay predicted by kinematics . * ]      it was found that the emitting shell must cool for a time period of approximately @xmath14 in the detector rest frame ( where @xmath15 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a comoving time of @xmath16 and an arrival time of @xmath17 by the standard transformations . as a result ,",
    "the observed cooling time was comparable in length to the duration due to curvature ( e.g. @xmath18 s ) .",
    "such slow cooling overwhelmed the curvature dependency with cooling effects throughout the entire length of the pulse , thereby allowing for a new pulse shape evolution .",
    "it is emphasized that slow cooling was the only method included in this study which was able to break the robust curvature dependency as imposed by the kinematics of two colliding shells .",
    "typical cooling times , however , are commonly quoted as being shorter than the duration of the pulse ( e.g. @xmath19 s ) .",
    "a remedy to this situation is to minimize the timescale on which curvature effects can be detected by reducing the radius and/or increasing the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting shell .",
    "this , in turn , allows for a relatively shorter cooling time .",
    "long cooling times , however , face a number of problems including efficiency considerations which must be addressed ."
