    "magnitude - limited searches for members of nearby star - forming regions are an important basis for a variety of studies of young stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "for instance , such surveys provide well - defined membership samples from which unbiased initial mass functions ( imfs ) can be derived . in addition , newly discovered young brown dwarfs are valuable targets for detailed studies of the formation of objects at the bottom of the mass function .    the taurus dark cloud complex has proven to be amenable to a census of its low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the members of this region are nearby ( 140  pc ) and young ( 1  myr ) , and thus can be detected down to very low masses .",
    "in addition , because a majority of the members of taurus ( excluding protostars ) exhibit relatively low extinction ( @xmath6 ) , they are accessible to measurements at both optical and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths . over time , surveys for new members in this low - density , dispersed population ( @xmath7 - 10  pc@xmath8 ) have steadily expanded in areal coverage @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite used wide - field optical imaging , 2mass data , and followup spectroscopy to search for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in 8  deg@xmath0 that encompassed half of the known pre - main sequence population in taurus .",
    "they discovered nine new members with spectral types of m5.75-m9.5 , corresponding to masses of 0.1 - 0.015  @xmath3 by the theoretical evolutionary models of @xcite .    at the conclusion of the study by @xcite , there remained candidate members of taurus that had not been observed spectroscopically . in this paper",
    ", we identify the most promising of those candidates (   [ sec : cand ] ) , describe spectroscopic observations of them (   [ sec : obs ] ) , measure spectral types and determine whether they are taurus members (   [ sec : class ] ) , and discuss the physical properties of the six new members and update the imf from @xcite (   [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "@xcite used optical and near - ir photometry to select potential young stars and brown dwarfs in 8  deg@xmath0 of taurus . in this section ,",
    "we examine the photometry from that survey to identify the remaining candidates that lack the spectroscopy needed to confirm membership in taurus and to measure spectral types . to do this",
    ", we could simply use the observed color - magnitude and color - color diagrams ( e.g. , @xmath9 vs.  @xmath10 , @xmath11 vs.  @xmath12 ) in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "instead , we revise those methods in a way that more clearly separates taurus members from field stars .",
    "we wish to identify the stars in the fields surveyed by @xcite that have both the colors and the absolute photometry expected of members of the taurus population .",
    "optical color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are widely used for selecting candidate members of clusters on this basis . however , in star - forming clouds , the presence of highly variable extinction ( @xmath13 - 20 in taurus ) increases the contamination of background stars in the region of the cmd inhabited by members and prevents reliable mass estimates for candidate members ( i.e. , reddened high - mass members and unreddened low - mass members can have the same optical color and magnitude ) .",
    "the photometry in such diagrams can not be corrected for extinction when only two bands are available . in the case of the taurus fields , in addition to @xmath9 and @xmath14 photometry",
    ", we have near - ir data from 2mass . as a result",
    ", we have been able to estimate the extinction toward each star by dereddening its position in @xmath11 versus @xmath12 until it intersects the sequence of colors for dwarfs later than k6 @xcite , which is the range of spectral types occupied by most known members of taurus . if a star has a spectral type earlier than k6 , the extinction will be underestimated in this method , but that is acceptable .",
    "the dereddening process tends to remove background stars from the area of the cmd where members reside , and if a star s extinction is underestimated , then at worst it remains in that area and is selected as a candidate .",
    "in other words , an underestimate of extinction will not result in the rejection of a bonafide member . after correcting the photometry for extinction in this way , we plot the results on cmds of @xmath12 versus @xmath15 and @xmath10 versus @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : color ] .",
    "we choose @xmath15 as the magnitude because it correlates closely with bolometric luminosity , requires only a small correction for extinction , and is not susceptible to significant contamination from excess emission from circumstellar material .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath12 and @xmath10 colors are used because they increase rapidly with decreasing mass , producing a member sequence that is distinct from the location of most field stars in the cmds . in figure",
    "[ fig : color ] , we omit the stars appearing below the reddening vector in the diagram of @xmath9 versus @xmath10 in @xcite because they are well below the member sequence and thus are likely to be field stars . from the @xmath16 stars that remain ,",
    "we plot only those that exhibit extinctions of @xmath1 .",
    "we are primarily interested in identifying candidate members at lower extinctions that might fall within the limit of @xmath17 that defined the imf from @xcite so that we can approach 100% completeness for that sample .",
    "the extinctions derived for the construction of figure  [ fig : color ] are only rough estimates since they are based on photometry alone without any information on the spectral types .",
    "therefore , to be certain that members at @xmath17 were not missed , we considered a threshold of @xmath1 in selecting candidates . in figure",
    "[ fig : color ] , we include all objects that have been spectroscopically confirmed as members in this work and in previous studies for the taurus fields in question .",
    "we also indicate the field stars identified through our new spectroscopy , while omitting the field stars found in previous work .",
    "we now describe the regions in figure  [ fig : color ] that are inhabited by taurus members and examine the photometry to identify any potential members that lack previous spectra . when the known members of taurus are placed on a hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram , they exhibit median and maximum ages of @xmath18 and 10  myr , respectively , on the model isochrones of @xcite , except at the latest spectral types , where some of the members appear between the isochrones for 10 and 30  myr ( @xcite ,   [ sec : ext ] ) .",
    "we plot the 10  myr isochrone from 0.015 to 1  @xmath19 in the diagram of @xmath12 versus @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : color ] by combining the predicted effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities @xcite , a temperature scale this is compatible with the adopted models @xcite , dwarf colors and bolometric corrections @xcite , and a distance modulus of 5.76 @xcite .",
    "the plateau near @xmath20 in the resulting isochrone in figure  [ fig : color ] , which does not appear in a plot of the isochrone in @xmath21 versus @xmath22 , reflects the rapid increase in @xmath12 between m5 and m9 .",
    "because standard values of intrinsic @xmath10 as a function of spectral type are not available , we can not plot the isochrone in @xmath10 versus @xmath15 .",
    "however , the lower envelope of the sequence of known members in @xmath10 versus @xmath15 effectively delineates the location of the 10  myr isochrone ( except at late types , or @xmath23 ) and the line above which we should search for new members .",
    "approximately 23 stars lack spectra and fall near the member sequences in both of the cmds in figure  [ fig : color ] . in the next section ,",
    "we describe spectroscopy of 22 of these stars , which are listed in tables  [ tab : back ] and [ tab : mem ] .",
    "the remaining source is 2masss  0435283 + 241000 , which has dereddened photometry of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we did not observe this star because it is at the detection limits of both the optical and 2masss data and therefore its positions in the cmds are highly uncertain .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] summarizes our observations of the 22 candidate members of taurus identified in the previous section .",
    "one of these objects , 2masss  j0419012 + 280248 , was observed on two occasions .",
    "the fast spectrometer @xcite on the 1.5  m tillinghast reflector at the fred lawrence whipple observatory was operated with the 300  l  mm@xmath27 grating ( @xmath28   ) and @xmath29 slit , providing a resolution of fwhm@xmath30   .",
    "the keck  i low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) was configured with the 400  l  mm@xmath27 grating ( @xmath31   ) , gg495 blocking filter , and @xmath32 slit ( fwhm@xmath33   ) . with the blue channel spectrometer at the mmt observatory , we used the 600  l  mm@xmath27 grating ( @xmath34   ) , lp495 blocking filter , and @xmath32 slit ( fwhm@xmath35   ) .",
    "each spectrum was collected with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 300 to 2700  s. after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the spectra were extracted and calibrated in wavelength with arc lamp data .",
    "the spectra were then corrected for the sensitivity functions of the detectors , which were measured from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "we measure spectral types and assess membership for the 22 candidate taurus members that were observed spectroscopically by applying the methods of classification described in our previous studies of taurus and other young populations @xcite .",
    "we classify 13 candidates as background giants and one candidate as a background early - type star .",
    "strong absorption in the ca  ii triplet is the most distinguishing feature of the giants , as illustrated for two of these stars in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "the data for the other eight candidates are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "two of these stars , 2masss  j0418021 + 281748 and j0436008 + 225517 , are below the main sequence when placed on the h - r diagram with the distance of taurus , which indicates that they are probably field dwarfs behind the star - forming region .",
    "although young stars that are observed in scattered light can appear at comparable positions on the h - r diagram ( @xcite ,   [ sec : ext ] ) , such stars usually exhibit emission in h@xmath4 or some other evidence of youth .",
    "however , no such signatures are found in the data for these two stars .",
    "in addition , the strength of the k  i and na  i absorption in the spectrum of 2masss  j0436008 + 225517 provides conclusive evidence that it is a field dwarf .",
    "the spectra for the six remaining sources in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] exhibit evidence of youth , and thus membership in taurus , in the form of the weak k  i and na  i absorption features that are characteristic of pre - main - sequence objects @xcite .",
    "the membership of five of these sources is independently established by the presence of reddening in their spectra and their positions above the main sequence for the distance of taurus , which indicate that they can not be field dwarfs in the foreground or the background of the cloud , respectively .",
    "the equivalent widths of h@xmath4 emission in kpno - tau  11 , 13 , and 15 are consistent with those of both active field dwarfs and young objects . meanwhile ,",
    "the much stronger emission in kpno - tau  10 , 12 , and 14 is common among the latter but rare in the former @xcite . for the coolest new member , kpno - tau  12 , we find that the best match to the optical spectrum is provided with an average of dwarf and giant spectra ( normalized at 7500   ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] , which is consistent with the results of our previous classifications of young objects later than m6 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for kpno - tau  12 in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] is from the november observations with keck .",
    "we did not use the january data from the mmt in measuring the spectral type of this object because the signal - to - noise was too low .",
    "the classifications and other measurements for the 16 background field stars and the six new taurus members are listed in tables  [ tab : back ] and [ tab : mem ] , respectively .",
    "the photometric errors are @xmath36  mag for kpno - tau  12 and @xmath37  mag for the remaining sources .",
    "in this section , we use the photometry , spectroscopy , and theoretical evolutionary models to examine the physical properties of the six new taurus members .",
    "excess continuum emission and optical emission lines are signatures of circumstellar disks and accretion that could appear in the available data for the new taurus members .",
    "the near - ir colors of the six new members match those of reddened dwarfs and have no significant excess emission in the @xmath38-band .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that only half of the known members of taurus exhibit @xmath38-band excess emission , while a much larger fraction show evidence for disks in photometry at longer bandpasses such as @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "five of the new members show moderate to strong emission in h@xmath4 ( @xmath40 - 36   ) that is typical of young stars in taurus , while the m9 object kpno - tau  12 exhibits a far larger equivalent width .",
    "a given value of @xmath41 corresponds to larger equivalent widths at later spectral types as the stellar continuum surrounding h@xmath4 becomes weaker .",
    "in addition , when this faint continuum is detected at low signal - to - noise , it is possible to erroneously measure arbitrarily large values of the equivalent width .",
    "however , in the case of kpno - tau  12 , the continuum near h@xmath4 is well - detected , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : spec3 ] . in measuring the equivalent width of h@xmath4",
    ", the continuum level across the line was taken to be the level from the best fit m9 standard (   [ sec : class ] ) after normalizing the two spectra at the surrounding continuum ( 6400 - 6500 and 6600 - 6700   ) . in this way , the equivalent width of h@xmath4 is confidently measured to be between 850 and 1050    in the november spectrum . because of insufficient signal - to - noise in the continuum surrounding h@xmath4 , an equivalent width was not measured from the january spectrum .    to compare the h@xmath4 emission in kpno - tau  12 to that in other m - type sources , we consider the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "we arrived at two separate flux calibrations for the november spectrum of kpno - tau  12 by using the @xmath9-band photometry of this source from @xcite and the data for the spectrophotometric standard .",
    "we adopted the average of these calibrations , which differed by 20% . from the resulting spectrum",
    ", we measured an h@xmath4 flux of @xmath42  erg  s@xmath27  @xmath43 in the november data .",
    "meanwhile , the flux of h@xmath4 in the january spectrum was 30% higher .",
    "after correcting the november measurement for an extinction of @xmath44 and combining the result with the bolometric luminosity derived in the next section , we find log  @xmath45 , which is slightly higher than the strongest emission observed in late - m dwarfs @xcite and two orders of magnitude greater than the typical values for these objects @xcite .",
    "the only known young late - m sources with comparable h@xmath4 emission are ls - rcra  1 in r coronae australis @xcite and s  ori  71 in @xmath46  orionis @xcite .",
    "several other young low - mass objects have been found with h@xmath4 intensities that are only a few times lower than those in kpno - tau  12 , ls - rcra  1 , and s  ori  71 @xcite .",
    "there are additional indications that active accretion is probably occurring in kpno - tau  12 .",
    "the tio bands at 6600 - 7300    are weaker than those of the best fit standard spectrum in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] , which is suggestive of veiling from blue excess continuum emission . on the other hand",
    ", this behavior could imply a spectral type later than our classification of m9 since the tio bands become weaker and eventually disappear from m to l types . but given the good quality of the fit of m9 to the data beyond 7300    and the presence of intense h@xmath4 emission , the weak appearance of the tio bands is probably a result of continuum veiling .",
    "we also detect emission in he  i at 6678    and in the ca  ii ir triplet , as shown in figure  [ fig : spec3 ] .",
    "we measure equivalent widths of @xmath47    for he  i and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50    for ca  ii at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662   .",
    "kpno - tau  12 is the coolest young object known to exhibit these emission lines , which are usually indicators of intense accretion when observed in young stars @xcite .",
    "alternatively , emission in he  i and ca  ii , as well as strong h@xmath4 and continuum veiling , can be attributed to a magnetic flare event , as in the case of the field m9.5 dwarf 2massw  j0149090 + 295613 @xcite . however , since the duty cycle of such flares is low in field objects @xcite and the emission in kpno - tau  12 was strong at both epochs of our observations , the emission in kpno - tau  12 is probably not from a flare event .",
    "given that kpno - tau  12 is member of a star - forming region , it is much more likely that the emission in h@xmath4 , he  i , ca  ii , and the blue continuum are the result of active accretion .      following the procedures described by @xcite , we estimate extinctions , effective temperatures , and bolometric luminosities from the spectral types and photometry for the six new taurus members . the values for these parameters are listed in table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "the combined uncertainties in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and bc@xmath53 ( @xmath54 , 0.03 , 0.1 ) correspond to errors of @xmath55 in the relative values of log  @xmath22 .",
    "when an uncertainty in the distance modulus is included ( @xmath56 ) , the total uncertainties are @xmath57 .",
    "we use the temperatures and luminosities in table  [ tab : mem ] to place the six sources on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] . for reference",
    ", we also show the previously known taurus members that have @xmath17 and are within the 8.4  deg@xmath0 surveyed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which comprise the imf sample from @xcite .",
    "the five new members at m3-m6 fall within this sequence of members , which is spread between @xmath58 and 10  myr for most masses .",
    "meanwhile , the new m9 source kpno - tau  12 appears near the 30  myr model isochrone of @xcite , as does one of the previously known m8.5 members .",
    "an age of 30  myr is much larger than expected given the median age of 1  myr for the taurus population and the apparent presence of active accretion in kpno - tau  12 .",
    "interestingly , the one other young late - m source known to exhibit accretion signatures in the form of he  i and ca  ii emission , ls - rcra  1 , also falls much lower on the h - r diagram than expected @xcite .",
    "we consider three possible explanations for the anomalously old ages implied by the h - r diagrams of some late - m sources , particularly kpno - tau  12 and ls - rcra  1 .",
    "first , there could be deficiencies in either the models or the conversion of spectral types to temperatures . in this work",
    ", we use a temperature scale that has been adjusted at late spectral types so that the low - mass members of taurus and ic  348 have median ages comparable to the ones of the higher mass sources @xcite . as a result",
    ", the adopted combination of models and temperature scale should produce the most reliable age and mass estimates that are currently possible .",
    "however , as suggested by @xcite in the case of ls - rcra  1 , intense accretion could produce an evolutionary path on the h - r diagram that differs from that predicted by models of non - accreting objects . indeed , both of the known late - m objects with evidence for accretion in the form of he  i and ca  ii emission are subluminous on the h - r diagram .",
    "@xcite proposed a second explanation for the low luminosity of ls - rcra  1 in which this object is seen in scattered light . for a young star that is occulted by an optically thick structure such as an edge - on disk , the observed photometry measures only the scattered light .",
    "as a result , the luminosity implied by the photometry is an underestimate , and the star appears subluminous for its temperature on the h - r diagram . for a low - mass source undergoing intense accretion , it is possible that a significant fraction of the object is blocked by accreting circumstellar material , which could account for the correlation between accretion activity and low luminosity for kpno - tau  12 and ls - rcra  1 .",
    "however , this occulting mechanism would need to be more efficient for brown dwarfs than for stars since young stars in taurus with he  i emission do not have systematically lower luminosities than other stellar members .",
    "as a third possibility , the old ages inferred from the model isochrones could result from errors in the luminosity estimates of young sources .",
    "the finite width of the taurus sequence on the h - r diagram could arise not from a spread in ages but from various sources such as extinction uncertainties , unresolved binaries , variability from accretion and from rotation of spotted surfaces , and differences in distances to individual members @xcite .",
    "if so , then the width of the sequence in log  l should remain roughly constant at all masses , and thus correspond to an increasing apparent spread of ages as the separation between model isochrones in log  l decreases from stellar to substellar masses .",
    "this phenomenon probably produces erroneously old ages on the model isochrones for at least some low - mass members of young clusters , but would not explain the fact that both late - type objects showing he  i emission are subluminous .",
    "we now consider the masses of the new taurus members . by combining the positions on the h - r diagram with the evolutionary models of @xcite",
    ", we infer masses of 0.10 , 0.13 , 0.15 , 0.16 , and 0.4  @xmath19 for kpno - tau  14 , 11 , 13 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "these mass estimates are not sensitive to uncertainties in the luminosities since the predicted evolution of a star is mostly vertical on the h - r diagram for ages of @xmath59  myr . however , this is not true at substellar masses , where the mass tracks have significant components in both temperature and luminosity .",
    "the models imply a mass of 0.03  @xmath19 for the m9 object kpno - tau  12 based on its position on the h - r diagram . under two of the three explanations for the low luminosity of this source (   [ sec : ext ] ) , the luminosity estimate is uncertain . in these cases ,",
    "a more reliable mass is derived by placing the object on the 1  myr isochrone for the adopted temperature , which would imply a mass of 0.015  @xmath19 from the models of @xcite . for the third explanation in which the temperature and luminosity are significantly affected by accretion",
    ", kpno - tau  12 could have an even lower mass @xcite .",
    "if this object does have a mass below 0.015  @xmath19 , one might be tempted to refer to it as an accreting free - floating planetary mass object .",
    "however , the various properties of low - mass brown dwarfs  such as the evidence of intense accretion in objects like kpno - tau  12  indicate that they probably form in a star - like fashion rather than in circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "therefore , the term  planetary \" has little or no applicability . for the purposes of this work , we adopt a mass of 0.02  @xmath19 for this object .",
    "as mentioned previously , the imf presented by @xcite included the 86 known taurus members that fell within the 8.4  deg@xmath0 surveyed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and that had extinctions of @xmath17 .",
    "there remained a few potential members that lacked spectroscopy within these defining parameters , so the imf sample was not 100% complete .",
    "however , because the candidates were not concentrated at a particular magnitude range , @xcite concluded that the sample of confirmed members was unbiased in mass down to the completeness limit of the photometry , which corresponded to 0.02  @xmath19 for @xmath60 . through spectroscopy of those candidates ,",
    "we have found six new members , all of which have @xmath61 . after adding these sources to the extinction - limited sample from @xcite , we arrive at the imf in figure  [ fig : imf ] , which should be virtually 100% complete for @xmath17 and masses above 0.02  @xmath19 in the 8.4  deg@xmath0 survey fields . because of the small number of new members that are added to the imf from @xcite and the wide range of masses of these new sources , the shapes of the imfs here and in @xcite do not differ significantly .",
    "thus , the conclusions from @xcite regarding the observed variations in the imfs of taurus and the trapezium remain unchanged .",
    "we have obtained spectroscopy for candidate young stars and brown dwarfs that appeared in an optical and ir photometric survey of 8  deg@xmath0 of the taurus star - forming region by @xcite .",
    "we have estimated individual extinctions for the stars detected in the survey and have plotted the dereddened photometry on color - magnitude diagrams . within an extinction limit of @xmath1 , we identified 22 sources that were potential members of taurus and that lacked previous spectroscopy . through optical spectroscopy of these candidates",
    ", we have discovered six new members with spectral types ranging from m2.75 to m9 . from the spectral types and photometry of these objects , we have estimated extinctions , effective temperatures , and bolometric luminosities , and",
    "have combined these results with the evolutionary models of @xcite to infer individual masses that range from 0.4 to 0.02  @xmath3 .",
    "these new members fall within the extinction limit of @xmath17 that defined the sample from which @xcite derived an imf .",
    "therefore , we have added them to that extinction - limited sample and have presented the updated imf , which applies to the 8.4  deg@xmath0 in taurus surveyed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the new m9 source is a particularly interesting discovery from this work .",
    "it has the second latest spectral type of the known members of taurus .",
    "in addition , it exhibits the strongest h@xmath4 emission observed to date for a late - m source ( @xmath5   , log  @xmath62 ) and is the least massive object found with emission in he  i 6678    and the ca  ii ir triplet , which are suggestive of active accretion .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of the emission lines in this object would provide valuable insight into the formation of low - mass brown dwarfs .",
