    "recently , the nucleus @xmath4pb has been studied widely , both theoretically and experimentally , to unravel the role of entrance channel dynamics on fusion process . shidling",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the evaporation residue ( er ) cross sections and gamma multiplicity distributions for @xmath0o + @xmath1w and @xmath2f + @xmath3ta reactions leading to the same compound nucleus @xmath4pb@xmath5 .",
    "both the systems under consideration have a charge product @xmath6.@xmath7 @xmath8 700 ( where z@xmath9 and z@xmath10 are projectile and target atomic numbers , respectively ) , much lesser than the approximate threshold value ( @xmath11 1600 ) for the onset of entrance channel dependence as per swiatecki s dynamical model @xcite .",
    "although the value of the entrance channel mass asymmetry ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 being the target and projectile mass numbers ) of the two systems ( 0.84 and 0.81 , respectively ) are similar , they are on either side of the businaro - gallone critical mass asymmetry ( @xmath14 = 0.837 ) @xcite .",
    "the measured ( normalised ) er cross section and moments of gamma multiplicity distribution of the system @xmath0o + @xmath1w were found to be @xcite significantly enhanced as compared to those of the other system @xmath2f + @xmath3ta at higher excitation energies , indicating entrance channel effects . as the reduction of er yield in the reaction @xmath2f + @xmath3ta , as compared to @xmath0o + @xmath1w reaction , was correlated with a selective suppression of contributions of higher spin events in the former , the authors @xcite attributed it to be due to the onset of pre - equilibrium fission @xcite in the more symmetric system .",
    "nasirov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite claimed that the observed reduction in er cross - section ( @xmath15 ) , mentioned above @xcite , at higher energies for the reaction @xmath2f + @xmath3ta could be due to incorrect estimation of fusion cross - section ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that in the reconstruction of @xmath16 @xcite from fission like fragment yields , the contributions of quasi - fission and fast fission , which cause hindrance to complete fusion , were not properly identified and subtracted from the measured fission yield , leading to overestimation of @xmath16 and thereby a lowering of the normalised ( @xmath17 ) er yield . indeed , from the theoretical analysis performed in the framework of the dinuclear system and advanced statistical models @xcite , nasirov _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the magnitude of hindrance to complete fusion was different in the two systems - more for @xmath2f + @xmath3ta as compared to @xmath0o + @xmath1w .",
    "it was interesting to note that the calculation of nasirov _ et al .",
    "_ predicted a dramatic increase in quasi - fission and fast - fission with increase in energy for the @xmath2f + @xmath3ta reaction .",
    "another recent fusion calculation @xcite using dynamical cluster - decay model ( dcm ) and wong model however suggest that , while @xmath2f + @xmath3ta data can be explained well without incorporation of any quasi - fission , the presence of quasi - fission may not be ruled out in the case of @xmath0o + @xmath1w .",
    "the prevailing ambiguity has prompted us to have a serious relook into the problem through a different experimental observable , fission fragment mass distribution , which has already been established to be a robust tool for direct detection of the presence / absence of quasi - fission in a nuclear reaction .",
    "variation of the width of the fragment mass distribution with excitation energies is known to be a sensitive probe for studying quasi - fission @xcite . as the statistical fission of the compound nucleus",
    "is expected to proceed through an unconditional mass symmetric fission barrier , the fission fragment mass distribution is symmetric around a@xmath18/2 ( where a@xmath18 is the compound nucleus mass number ) , if fine structures due to shell effect are discounted for .",
    "since shell effects are expected to be washed out at these excitation energies under consideration @xcite , the mass distributions should be symmetric with a smooth increase in width ( or standard deviation @xmath19 ) of the distribution with excitation energy @xcite .",
    "quasi - fission is a competing dynamical process which proceeds through a mass asymmetric conditional fission barrier , making the fragment mass distribution asymmetric .",
    "the mass distribution is also expected to be asymmetric for fast fission that occurs for the composite system when the angular - momentum - dependent fission barrier becomes extremely small .",
    "however , the contribution of fast fission is negligibly small for our measured energy range @xcite.thus , an admixture of statistical fission events and quasi - fission will result in larger width of the mass distribution and the width of the mass distribution is expected to increase if there is an enhancement of quasi - fission with change in the excitation energy . therefore , any sudden change in the width of the mass distribution would indicate departure from full equilibration , while onset of mass asymmetry or an increase in width of mass distribution would be a strong signal of quasi - fission .    in this work ,",
    "we report the fission fragment mass distributions of the two aforementioned reactions , @xmath2f + @xmath3ta and @xmath0o + @xmath1w populating the compound nuclei @xmath4pb@xmath5 at similar excitation energies to look for the presence / absence of quasi - fission .",
    "no significant deviation was found between the two entrance channels and the monotonic increase in the variation of the width ( standard deviation ) of the mass distributions clearly indicate the absence of quasi - fission in either of the reactions .",
    "the experiment was performed at the 15ud pelletron accelerator facility of the inter university accelerator centre ( iuac ) , new delhi with pulsed beam of @xmath2f and @xmath0o on enriched isotopes of @xmath3ta of thickness 200 @xmath20g/@xmath21 with carbon backing of 20 @xmath20g/@xmath21 and self supporting @xmath1w of thickness 100 @xmath20g/@xmath21 respectively .",
    "the width of pulse beam was 1.2 ns with a repetition rate of 250 ns .",
    "fission fragments were detected with two large area x - y position sensitive multi - wire proportional counters ( mwpcs ) @xcite .",
    "the mwpcs were mounted on two rotatable arms , at expected folding angles for complementary fission fragments .",
    "for the mass distribution measurements , the centre of the forward detector was kept at a polar angle ( @xmath22 ) = 75@xmath23 and the backward detector at @xmath22 = 74@xmath23 on either side of the beam axis .",
    "the forward detector was placed at 41 cm from the centre of the target and the backward detector was placed at a lesser distance of 29 cm from the target so as to ensure complete coverage of complementary fission fragments .",
    "the detectors were operated at a pressure of 3 torr of iso - butane gas .",
    "operating the detector at low pressure improves the timing resolution and at the same time makes the detectors almost transparent to elastic and quasi - elastic particles . for each event we measured the time of flight difference of the complementary fragments through the fast anode pulses ,",
    "the x - y coordinates of the fragments on the detector ( @xmath24 ) and the energy loss of the fragment inside the detector . from these measurements",
    ", we extracted the masses of the correlated fission events and the momentum transferred to the fissioning system .",
    "two silicon surface barrier detectors were placed at @xmath2510@xmath23 for beam flux monitoring and normalization using the collected elastic events .",
    "the faraday cup was also used as a means to normalize the observed fission events .",
    "( color online)folding angle distributions of complimentary fission fragments for the system , @xmath2f+ @xmath3ta at an excitation energy of 65 mev .",
    "the rectangle indicates the gate used to select the ff events for mass determination . ]",
    "a typical polar and azimuthal angle correlation plot of all fission fragments measured at an excitation energy of 65 mev is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath2f + @xmath3ta reaction .",
    "the peak of the folding angle distribution is consistent with the value expected for complete transfer of momentum of the projectile .",
    "these distributions being symmetric in both @xmath22 and @xmath26 suggests that there is no admixture of transfer induced fission . however , the width of the polar and azimuthal angular correlations is enhanced due to both fission reaction kinematics and the spread due to post scission neutron emission from fragments . as inclusion of the latter",
    "is undesirable , events within a gate as shown in the figure were analyzed .",
    "we have checked that the analysis of the data with narrower gates does not affect the width of the mass distributions within the error bar .",
    "we achieved mass resolution @xmath27 in the present experimental set up .",
    "while transfer induced fission is minimal , the inherent properties of the detectors ensure that fragments are well separated from elastic and quasi - elastic reaction channels in the time correlation and energy loss spectra .",
    "the difference of the time of flights , polar and azimuthal angles , momentum , and the recoil velocities were used to determine the masses of fission fragments .",

    "2 . the mass distributions at all energies are symmetric in nature and can be fitted with a single gaussian , as shown by solid ( red ) line , with peak close to the half of the combined target - projectile mass .",
    "the presence of quasi - fission usually leads to asymmetry in the mass distribution ( in the form of increased yields near target and projectile masses ) and thereby causes additional broadening of the distribution . it will be apparent from the following discussions that there was no significant admixture of an asymmetric distribution in the measured mass distributions .",
    "the variation of standard deviations @xmath19(u ) of the fitted experimental mass distributions plotted as a function of excitation energy is shown in fig .",
    "it shows that @xmath19(u ) increases smoothly with excitation energy for both the reactions and there is no anomalous large scale deviation in @xmath19(u ) at higher excitation energies between the two the reactions @xmath2f",

    "it indicates significant dominance of quasi - fission and fast fission in the former as compared to the later .",
    "qualitatively , this should have been reflected in the widths of their respective mass distributions ( in the form of anomalous increase of the width in the former with respect to the later)- which was not observed at all .",
    "unfortunately , no model exists at present that can predict the quantitative change in width of the mass distribution with changing quasi - fission fraction ; however , it may be mentioned that the present tool is sensitive enough to detect an admixture of @xmath28 quasi - fission in a reaction @xcite .    in case of statistical fission of the equilibrated compound nucleus , the variance ( @xmath29)of the fission fragment mass distribution is a linear function of the nuclear temperature at saddle point . dashed ( blue ) line in fig .",

    "it is to be mentioned here that the variance of the mass distribution also has a weak dependence on the mean square average value of angular momentum @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath41 with the value of the constant @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum ( @xmath40 ) of the cn was calculated by ccfull code @xcite .",
    "a value of the inverse stiffness parameter @xmath43 fitted the data well and was found to be consistent with the comprehensive compilation of the data @xcite . the uncertainty in calculation of @xmath19 due to the uncertainty in the compiled value of inverse stiffness parameter @xmath44",
    "is shown by the shaded region in fig 3 .",
    "it is evident that mass variances of both the systems followed the same trend within the limits of uncertainty .",
    "the admixture of fast and quasi - fission as predicted in the theoretical calculation @xcite for the reaction @xmath2f + @xmath3ta ( as shown in the inset of fig 3 ) , which gradually increases to as high as @xmath4550% with the increase in excitation energy , should have made the trend of variation of the standard deviation ( @xmath19 ) of mass distribution drastically different as compared to that for the @xmath0o + @xmath1w reaction at higher excitation energy .",
    "on the contrary , the present measurement clearly indicates that , both the reactions follow fusion fission path and there was no appreciable difference in the fusion dynamics for the two reactions in the measured excitation energy range .",
    "the present non observation of any appreciable quasi - fission in either of the two reactions is further confirmed by our theoretical calculation .",
    "we solved two - dimensional langevin equations with elongation ( @xmath46 ) and mass - asymmetry ( @xmath47 ) as collective coordinates @xcite to estimate the mass distributions for both the target - projectile combinations .",
    "the input angular momentum for each langevin event is sampled from the corresponding ccfull spin distribution .",

    "it is thus apparent from the present study that , for the two systems discussed above , the fusion dynamics pathways are almost identical and there is no indication of any substantial contribution from non - equilibrium reaction mechanisms like quasi - fission .",
    "incidentally , in earlier studies of admixture of quasi - fission @xcite , fission fragment mass distribution was found to be a sensitive tool even in cases where other probes like fragment angular distribution or pre - scission neutron multiplicity were not conclusive .",
    "the absence of any deviation from statistical model predicted width @xcite of the mass distribution even at the highest excitation energy , where quasi - fission contributions should be more significant if present , leads us to infer that quasi - fission is not significantly present in either of the two reactions .",
