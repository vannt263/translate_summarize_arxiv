    "@xmath113 , the knot can diffuse a distance @xmath114 .",
    "we thus estimate a `` processivity length '' over which a tight knot diffuses , before opening up , by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a constant of order unity .",
    "the processivity length increases strongly with the screening length @xmath76 and quickly reaches a macroscopic length , indicating that the relaxation of a tight knot will be by diffusion along the chain , even for very long chains .",
    "also note that @xmath117 is in general much larger than the electrostatic persistence length which only grows quadratically with the screening length ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "we have shown that long - ranged coulomb forces generate a tension that tightens topological constraints into dense localized regions , leaving the rest of the polymer unentangled . for knots on ring polymers ,",
    "we confirm the  factorization \" of composite knots into their prime components .",
    "tight knots remain , even when the coulomb interaction is screened , as long as the electrostatic contributions dominate the rigidity of the polymer .",
    "once formed , tight knots drastically slow down the equilibration of the polymer ( or polymer solution ) , as they typically relax by diffusion along the backbone .",
    "if the coulomb interactions are strong enough , the knot is pulled so tight that it is unable to diffuse , and its position appears frozen .",
    "this is different from uncharged polymers where molecular dynamics simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite find that tight knots in short uncharged polymers open up rapidly .",
    "our results predict that tight knots in polyelectrolytes can be very stable and cause long relaxation times .",
    "while we have focused on single polymers , it is natural to speculate about similar behavior in solutions of many chains .",
    "it is indeed quite likely that _ inter - chain _ entanglements are also tightened in polyelectrolyte solutions and gels .",
    "additional consequences of tight knots are in their influence on mobility ( electrophoresis ) , and on the mechanical strength of polymers .",
    "it has been shown recently by direct measurement on dna and actin filaments that knots significantly weaken the strand  @xcite .",
    "similarly , molecular dynamics simulations of knotted polyethylene chains also find that the strands becomes weaker , and typically break at the entrance point where the straight segment ends and the tight knot begins  @xcite .",
    "single stranded dna is relatively fragile and sometimes breaks during electrophoresis or when subject to flow ; tight knots may well be responsible for this phenomenon .",
