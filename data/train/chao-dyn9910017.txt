    "in the absence of external forcing the fluid can not maintain its steady state because of the continous dissipation of energy .",
    "the decay of kinetic energy in incompressible fluid turbulence has been explored in several studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies , principally numerical , indicate that kinetic energy decays as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the initial time , i.e. the time when the initial forcing is switched off .",
    "the value of @xmath2 seems to depend on the initial state .",
    "similarly , recent numerical studies of decaying mhd turbulence @xcite also suggest that the total energy decays as power of time",
    ". the phenomena of decaying mhd turbulence is observed in many different situations .",
    "star - forming clouds are astrophysical examples @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we described a new shell model for mhd turbulence , which has all the conservation laws in the inviscid , unforced limit , has the right symmetrires and reduces to the well - known goy shell model for fluid turbulence in absence of any magnetic field . in this paper",
    "we use our shell model to study decaying mhd turbulence .",
    "we begin by solving this set of equations with the external forces and by using the numerical method described there .",
    "we evolve the shell velocities @xmath3 and magnetic fields @xmath4 till we achieve the nonequilibrium , statistical steady state whose properties are described in ref.@xcite .",
    "once we attain this state , say at a time @xmath5 , we use the last set of shell velocities and magnetic fields , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as the initial condition for our shell - model study of decaying turbulence in which we solve our shell - model equations but with all the forcing terms set equal to zero .",
    "we then use the resulting time series for @xmath3 and @xmath4 to determine the total energy @xmath8 and the total crosshelicity @xmath9 where the origin of time is taken to be zero .",
    "we find that @xmath10 , with @xmath11 ; this is illustrated in the log - log plot of fig.1 .",
    "as we have noted above , it is relevant for initial conditions that have the correct statistical properties of homogenous , isotropic mhd turbulence which are well decribed by our shell model .",
    "= 5.5 cm = 5.5 cm    in a recent paper @xcite the effects of random initial conditions on the decaying solutions of the unforced navier - stokes equation with hyperviscosity have been discussed : it has been shown that , for an initially gaussian velocity distribution , equal - time two point correlation functions like @xmath12 decay as @xmath13 .",
    "it has also been shown that , for this particular choice of initial conditions , the theory remains finite ( in a field - theoretic sense ) just by renormalisation of the two - point vertex functions . however , it is more relevant to explore the statitical properties of decaying fluid turbulence with ordinary viscosity .",
    "it is also important to find out how the introduction of magnetic fields influences this decay . in this paper",
    "we study decaying mhd with ordinary viscosity ; we work with both the @xmath14mhd equations and a @xmath15-dimensional generalisation of the @xmath16mhd model introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "we show that both these models give similar results . in particular ,",
    "we show that , in both these models , appropriately defined structure functions decay with a power law in time ; this is modulated by a scaling function whose form depends on the initial state . in section.ii",
    ", we describe the equations we work with and the intial conditions we use . for most of the calculations in this chapter ,",
    "we choose initial correlations which are analytic in the low - wavenumber limit .",
    "we choose ordinary viscosities for both velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "we calculate the _ dynamic exponent _ @xmath17 and show that it is unaffected by the presence of the nonlinearities , i.e. , it remains 2 .",
    "we next show that if there is no initial cross - correlation between velocity and magnetic fields , correlation functions defined at the same spatial point decay with power laws in time and , consequently , two point structure functions also decay likewise . also ,",
    "multipoint correlation functions ( and structure functions ) exhibit similar behaviour , with simple ( and not anomalous ) scaling in time . in other words , the exponents for high - order structure functions are simply related to those of two - point functions .",
    "another interesting feature is that there is no change in the exponents with the introduction of the magnetic field ( i.e. the exponents are the same for fluid and mhd turbulence ) ; only the amplitudes of the correlation or structure functions change . in the section iii",
    "we show that in the presence of suitable cross correlations higher order correlations ( and consequently structure functions ) decay more slowly than when there is no cross correlation , i.e. , they display anomalous scaling . in section",
    "iv we extend and discuss our results in the context of the decay of fully developed mhd turbulence . in section",
    "v we conclude and compare results obtained from both @xmath14mhd and our simplified model .",
    "the dynamical equations which govern the time evolutions of the velocity and magnetic fields in a magnetised fluid are given by the equations of magnetohydrodynamics , namely , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocity and the magnetic fields , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fluid and magnetic viscosities , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent pressure and density , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are external forces .",
    "we also impose the incompressibility condition @xmath27 and the divergence - free condition on the magnetic field @xmath28 . in the absence of magnetic fields",
    "the mhd equations reduce to usual navier - stokes equation for fluid turbulence .",
    "we now briefly present the ideas that go into the construction of the model , which has already been discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "since this model is an extension of burgers equation for fluid dynamics to mhd , it should have the following properties :    * both the equations should be galilean invariant . * the equations should be invariant under @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 i.e. the velocity field is odd parity and the magnetic field is even parity . *",
    "the fields are _ irrotational _ vector fields in @xmath15-dimension ( similar to burgers velocity field ) . * the equations in the ideal limit",
    "i.e. in absence of any viscosity and any external forcing should conserve all the scalar conserved quantities of @xmath14mhd namely the total energy and the cross - helicity .",
    "the third conserved quantity i.e. the magnetic helicity is zero for irrotational fields .",
    "the above considerations lead to the following model equations @xmath32 @xmath33 whose relation to the @xmath14mhd equations is the same as the relation of the burgers equation to the navier - stokes equation . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocity and magnetic fields with magnitudes @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "these fields are @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these equations together conserve the total energy @xmath39 and crosshelicity @xmath40 .",
    "we have @xmath41 by homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "we choose the initial correlations to have the simple analytic forms @xmath42 and @xmath43    in @xmath44-space the @xmath14mhd equations are @xmath45 the quantities @xmath46 appear to include the incompressibility , @xmath47 ) is the transverse projection operator and wavevector arguments @xmath48 indicate spatial fourier transforms .",
    "the initial conditions we use for @xmath14mhd are @xmath49 which ensure the divergence - free conditons , namely , @xmath50 we discuss the structure of @xmath51 later . for the time being , we choose @xmath52 .",
    "these simple initial conditions , which are analytic in the @xmath53 limit , are enough to elcidate the issues raised in this chapter .",

    "this is similar to ref.@xcite . in the steady state of fluid or mhd turbulence ,",
    "the _ dynamic exponent _",
    "@xmath17 is determined by the form of the correlations of the driving noise and dimensionality of the space .",
    "for example , when driven by noise correlations of the form @xmath62 ( in @xmath14ns ) , one finds @xmath17 ( within a 1-loop dymanic renormalisation group calculation ) to be 2/3@xcite . what is @xmath17 when we study decaying mhd turbulence ?",
    "we calculate this within a 1-loop diagramatic perturbation theory : in the bare theory ( i.e. , when the nonlinear terms are absent ) @xmath63 . if the one - loop corrections to the response functions ( i.e. , to the viscosities ) have infrared divergence at zero external frequency , then @xmath64 ; otherwise @xmath63 .",
    "the diagrams shown in fig.2 contribute at the one - loop level in renormalisation of the fluid viscosity @xmath21 ,    similar diagrams renormalise @xmath22 .",

    "the forms of the integrals remain unchanged , only changes appear in the coefficients of the integrals where , in place of @xmath67 , appropriate projection operators are present .",
    "thus again there is no diagramatic correction to viscosities in the long - wavelenght limit in @xmath14mhd .",
    "hence the exponent @xmath17 is unaffected by the nonlinear terms .",
    "therefore , without any loss of generality , we can put @xmath68 .",
    "we now calculate the effective @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath66 at the one - loop level .",
    "the diagrams shown in fig.3 contribute at the 1-loop level to @xmath69 , these contributions are proportional to    @xmath71    which does not have any infrared divergence in _ any dimension_. the one - loop diagram contributing to @xmath70 has the same form .",
    "for @xmath14mhd the forms of the one - loop integrals do not change ; only the coefficients have appropriate factors of projection operators instead of @xmath72 . on purely dimensional grounds for @xmath66 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 similar quantities obtained from @xmath14mhd",
    "also show the same exponents but with different amplitudes.mhd equations and our simplified model as the projection operator @xmath75 that appears in the @xmath14mhd equations is dimensionless and the nonlinearities in both the equations do not renormalise due to the galilean invariance of our simplified model and @xmath14mhd equations ( which in turn keeps the power - counting structure same ) .",
    "amplitudes of course depend upon the specific models .",
    "similarly , energy spectra obtained in the steady - state from different models which give same power - counting in the one - loop integrals , when driven by stochastic forces with correlations having same scaling , have same scaling propertes , see , for e.g. refs.@xcite . ] note that the temporal dependences can be scaled out of the momentum integrals easily as the lower and upper limits of the momentum integrals can be extended to 0 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that all multi - point correlation functions also do not exhibit any infrared divergence in three dimensions : consider , e.g. , 3-point functions .",
    "even though @xmath77 at @xmath78 , it becomes non - zero at @xmath79 as can be easily seen at the one - loop level .",
    "@xmath80 has a tree - level contribution and next a one - loop contribution .",
    "the tree - level part being proportional to @xmath81 is zero because we have chosen a gaussian distribution for the initial conditions .",
    "the one - loop diagrams are shown in fig.([duuu ] ) .",
    "the 1-loop contribution is however nonzero .",

    "we can interpret this one - loop result by saying that the nonlinearities in eqs.([mhd1 ] ) and ( [ mhd2 ] ) are absent but there are nonzero initial three - point correlations at @xmath78 , i.e. , the effective linear system behaves as if @xmath86 hence @xmath87 \\langle u_i({\\bf k_1},t)u_j({\\bf k_2},t)u_s({\\bf -k_1-k_2},t ) > \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int d^3k_1 d^3k_2 exp(-k_1 ^2-k_2 ^ 2 -({\\bf k_1+k_2})^2)t \\exp[i{\\bf k_1.(x_1-x_2)+k_2.(x_1-x_3 ) } ]   \\nonumber \\\\&&k_{1i}k_{2j}k_{3s}d_{uuu } \\sim t^{-9/2}a_{ijs}({{\\bf x_1-x_2}\\over\\sqrt t},{{\\bf x_1-x_3}\\over\\sqrt t}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last step can be easily obtained by using the dimensionless variables @xmath88 .",

    "we can easily extend our calculation above to see that @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are functions with dimensionless argument @xmath113 .",
    "it is obvious that all these higher - order correlation functions _ do not _ exhibit any _ anomalous scaling _ in time ; their temporal behaviours can be obtained by simple dimensional arguments from the behaviours of the two - point functions .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath117 i.e. , @xmath118 , at the level of our one - loop approximation .",
    "what happens if we make @xmath119 non - zero ?",
    "let us first establish the form of @xmath51 : recall that @xmath120 has odd parity ( since @xmath121 is a polar vector whereas @xmath20 is an axial vector ) .",
    "hence it is purely imaginary and is an odd function of @xmath44 .",

    "this is the simplest analytic form with the desired structure .",
    "we consider the cases @xmath124 and 2 .",
    "it is easy to see that the value of @xmath17 does not change if @xmath125 as no new diagram appears .",
    "however , an additional diagram ( fig.4.6 ) contributes to the effective @xmath69 and @xmath70 if @xmath125 .",
    "this diagram yields the following contribution @xmath126 where we have used the identity @xmath127 naive power counting shows that this contribution is finite for @xmath66 , hence @xmath69 and @xmath70 are not renormalised even if @xmath125 , for both @xmath124 and 2 . the same conclusion holds for @xmath14mhd as the one - loop integral remains finite ; only the coefficients change because of factors of @xmath128 .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that for , @xmath129 , there is a diagramatic correction to @xmath130 ;    the form of the correction is @xmath131 however this correction vanishes for both @xmath124 and 2 since the integrand is odd in @xmath132 .",
    "hence there is no renormalisation of @xmath130 and two - point structure functions eqs.(4.22 ) and ( 4.23 ) scale as @xmath133 just as they do when @xmath134 .",

    "let us consider the four - point functions namely , @xmath138 at the 1-loop level , all of them they will have finite parts ( coming from initial auto correlations of velocity and magnetic fields ) .",
    "however , the first three of them will have _ new , infrared - divergent _ , one - loop contributions if @xmath125 .",
    "the analytic structure of the divergent 1-loop integral is illustrated for one of these correlation functions in fig.([fig_4 ] ) whose contribution is @xmath139 isotropy yields @xmath140 , \\label{delta}\\ ] ] so summing over @xmath141 and @xmath142 separately we obtain @xmath143 for @xmath66 .",
    "hence naive power counting for the integral in eq.([4pt ] ) yields , for @xmath124 , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a momentum scale arising from the lower limit of the integral .",
    "hence it is linearly infrared ( ir ) divergent for @xmath124 .",
    "for @xmath146 there is no ir divergence as is the case with @xmath134 .",
    "we analyse the case @xmath124 in detail : there is a disconnected diagram also that contributes to @xmath89 , which yields @xmath147 this is finite in the @xmath53 limit , so the contribution from the connected part will dominate in the @xmath148 limit . if we define the effective four - point correlation to be @xmath149 ( with the choice @xmath150 ) , where @xmath151 is just a constant ) then @xmath152 hence one obtains @xmath153 similarly @xmath154 .",
    "the other four - point functions are ( dimensionally ) linearly divergent at the 1-loop level ; however , the 1-loop integral vanishes becauses the integrand is odd in @xmath23 .",

    ", sweeping divergences appear when @xmath186 ( but k41 scaling obtains for @xmath187)@xcite .",
    "higher - order correlation functions have more severe divergences , hence their decay also depend strongly upon the integral scale .",
    "we have examined the decay of the total kinetic and magnetic energies , and the crosshelicity in our shell model , these quantities decay with power laws in time . in order to understand this behaviour analytically",
    ", we have employed a one - loop perturbation theory . in the first part of our calculations",
    ", we have chosen random initial conditions with the statistical properties given in eqs.(5),(6 ) and ( 10),(11 ) ( with no crosscorrelations ) .",
    "we have shown that such initial conditions lead to power - law decay of temporal correlations and appropriately defined structure functions . for initial correlations analytic in the long - wavelength limit no higher order structure functions",
    "show any anomalous scaling .",
    "however , on introducing crosscorrelations @xmath188 ( eq.4.43 ) higher - order structure functions exhibit anomalous scaling .",
    "this highlights the importance of crosscorrreations in the statistical properties of mhd turbulence .",
    "we have also extended our calculations to the case of initial correlations with singular variances and discussed the difficulties in the decay of fully developed mhd turbulence .",
    "we have argued , that these difficulties are related to the sweeping effect which arises in the study of the stochsatically driven mhd turbulence ( in the statistically steady state ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that we have obtained similar temporal behaviour from both @xmath14mhd and our simplified burgers - type model",
    ". it would be interesting to see if our results can be checked experimentally and numerically .",
