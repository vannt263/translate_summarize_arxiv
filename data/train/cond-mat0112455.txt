    "the magnetotransport phenomena @xcite in multiple - barrier heterostructures in which the magnetic is applied parallel to the electric field , was first reported by mendez , esaki and wang @xcite .",
    "the experimental data acquired in the presence of a magnetic field exhibited abnormal features such as a shift of the onset voltage @xcite , an increase of the peak - to - valley current ratio , as well as the presence of additional shoulders in the valley region of the i - v characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , these observations have not been fully accounted for on a theoretical basis .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that a 3-dimensional treatment of the electron motion is required for rigorously analyzing the impact the quantization in the transverse plane has upon the longitudinal electron motion .",
    "indeed relatively few works analyzing heterostructure devices with a magnetic field parallel to the electric field have been reported until now @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic field and electric field are perpendicular to the interface plane of the composing heterostructure materials , the density of state ( dos ) of the electrons in the plane perpendicular to the superlattice direction assumes discrete values corresponding to the landau levels @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic field is varied , the dos of the electrons changes and this strongly impacts the electron motion .",
    "the resulting transmission probability and current - voltage characteristics of the heterostructure studied become then quite different from the case with zero magnetic field .",
    "the additional shoulders observed in the valley region of the i - v characteristics in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite have been attributed to the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons which is one of the dominant scattering processes of electrons in the iii - v semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "we present here a model of resonant - tunneling in the presence of of a magnetic field , which includes the electron - lo phonon interaction @xcite , so as to account for the transition of the incident electron to different landau states .",
    "all possible transitions , including intra - landau state scattering will be considered in our model and numerical analysis .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field is to quantize the energy levels of the electron into landau levels .",
    "this is due to the fact that the projection of the helicoidal trajectory of the electron on the perpendicular plane corresponds to an harmonic oscillator . to account for the effect of this quantization on the longitudinal motion of electrons in the superlattice direction",
    ", we will develop a 3-dimensional transport model .",
    "we will then study the abnormal magnetotransport features with the aid of a 3-dimensional quantum simulator which numerically accounts for the contribution of the electron states in the perpendicular plane @xcite .",
    "the heterostructure device considered consists of an undoped al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as , double barrier structure sandwiched by heavily doped @xmath2-gaas left and right contact layers .",
    "our analysis only considers tunneling from electrons in the @xmath3 valley .",
    "the @xmath3 conduction - band edge in the absence of an applied voltage for the device studied is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "spin splitting in the magnetic field is ignored for simplicity .",
    "finally in this paper we are interested in the region of operation for which we have @xmath4 , and our numerical calculations will be consequently performed at the low temperature of @xmath5 and for magnetic fields up to 22 tesla .    in section ii , the 3d magnetotransport model used for electrons interacting with longitudinal optical phonons via polor scattering is introduced .",
    "the electron state is expanded in the generalized wannier - landau basis .",
    "expression for calculating the device transmission coefficient and current - voltage characteristics in the presence of phonon scattering are derived . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical results obtained for the main abnormal magnetotransport features using the above theoretical model are presented and analyzed . finally in the last section , a brief summary of our results is given .",
    "the hamiltonian of an electron system interacting with longitudinal optical phonons under a magnetic field in the double barrier structure is written as @xmath6 where the free and interaction terms are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are respectively the destruction and creation operators for electrons ( phonons ) and @xmath10 is the interaction weight for the phonon wave vector @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 stands for the longitudinal crystal wavevector @xmath13 and landau level @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the perpendicular plane , which results from the choice of landau gauge @xcite for the vector potential @xmath16 and @xmath11 is the mode of longitudinal optical phonon .",
    "the lo phonons will be represented by an einstein model with the constant phonon frequency @xmath17 .",

    "the band model selected consist of a tight - binding band structure in the superlattice direction and a parabolic band structure in the perpendicular plane .",
    "note that the transversal mass in the hamiltonian matrix varies in the longitudinal direction .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian matrix element as @xmath28 in which the position ( @xmath26 ) dependent transversal component is now absorbed in @xmath29 @xmath30 which depends on the perpendicular states l , incorporates the 3-dimensional effects in the longitudinal motion of the electrons .",
    "after some algebra , the matrix element of the interaction hamiltonian which determines the inter landau state transitions leads to @xmath31 where @xmath17 is the phonon frequency , @xmath32 is the transversal part of @xmath11 , and @xmath33 is the phase of the lo phonon of mode @xmath11 ( for a more detailed formalism , see ref .

    "an electron in the incident ballistic state @xmath54 which is scattered by a phonon will transit to other accessible states @xmath55 with total energy @xmath56 following the emission ( - ) or absorption ( + ) of a phonon .",

    "the current for a occupied sub - band @xmath82 reduces to @xmath85 . \\label{cur}\\ ] ] therefore , the area from 0 to @xmath81 of the transmission probability determines the contribution of each occupied sub - band to the total current .",
    "as mentioned above the heterostructure device considered consists of an undoped al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as , double barrier structure ( see inset of fig .  [ efbc ] ) sandwiched by heavily doped @xmath2-gaas left and right contact layers .",
    "the barriers and well are both @xmath86 wide .",
    "the donor density in the contact regions is @xmath87 .",
    "the donors are assumed to be completely ionized due to the heavy doping density .",
    "the value of the electron effective mass used for gaas and al@xmath0ga@xmath1as is @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the numerical calculation starts with the calculation of the matrix element @xmath90 which is required to evaluate the self energy @xmath91 associated with the inter landau state transitions for all possible values of @xmath66 .",
    "this self energy is then used to solve the envelope equation , and obtain the transmission coefficients .",
    "the current density is finally obtained by integrating the transmission coefficient obtained over the incident energy .",
    "we confined our numerical analysis to a single - sequential phonon scattering event since this is a quite reasonable approximation for the small heterostructure device under investigation .    in order to calculate the currents , it is required to calculate the chemical potential @xmath92 as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath75 . using eqn.([mub ] ) the chemical potential @xmath74 calculated for several temperatures",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ efbc ] versus @xmath75 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath74 is found to be a periodic function in @xmath76 .",
    "this figure clearly indicates that in the region of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath93 telsa ) using the approximation of a constant fermi energy @xmath94 would introduce a rather large error in the chemical potential .",
    "this would in turn adversely affect the accuracy of the device current calculated as is verified in fig .",
    "however at the temperature of @xmath95 , the oscillating behavior in @xmath92 disappears completely due to thermal population of all the landau states near the fermi energy .    in fig .",
    "[ teb ] , the transmission probability in a flat band ( no applied voltage ) is plotted for two magnetic fields of @xmath96 and @xmath97 telsa at @xmath5 . at this low temperature ,",
    "the emission of phonons dominates since the number of phonons in the system is negligible .",
    "the peaks beyond the main peak centered at 94 mev , are phonon - assisted resonant tunneling peaks which satisfy the following energy conservation relation @xmath98 where @xmath66 is the incident electron state and @xmath99 is the scattered state after the emission of one phonon and with @xmath100 .",
    "the energy of the phonon is chosen to be @xmath101 mev for gaas contact layers for simplicity . a single - sequential phonon - emission has been assumed .",
    "this was reported to be a valid approximation in a small size system like the double barrier structure considered @xcite the peak indicated by @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ teb ] arises when an incident electron moves in the structure with the emission of a single phonon and the landau level remains conserved while the peaks @xmath103 and @xmath104 indicate that phonon - assisted resonant - tunneling induced a transition to higher landau levels . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , the spacing @xmath105 between @xmath106 neighboring peaks increases in proportion to the applied external magnetic field where as the spacing between the main peak and @xmath102 peak remains constant as it is set by the phonon energy @xmath107 . for an incident state with landau levels @xmath108 ,",
    "transitions of the type @xmath109 arise ( with @xmath26 an integer verifying @xmath110 ) , and additional peaks appears between the main and @xmath102 peaks .",
    "the matrix element @xmath90 between landau states in eqn.(13 ) determines the strength of the inter landau state transitions in the transmission coefficient .",
    "for example , at @xmath96 telsa its argument @xmath111 assume values in the range @xmath112 depending on the phonon mode . after the matrix @xmath90 is summed over all possible phonon modes @xmath32 , the inter landau state transition probability is obtained .",
    "the analysis of the various scattering - assisted resonant - tunneling processes induced by lo phonon emission , indicates that the transmission probabilities for scattering events involving the transition between two different landau states ( @xmath113 ) is of the same order as the transmission probability for intra landau state ( @xmath114 ) scattering events .",
    "[ teb ] clearly shows this property .",
    "[ ivb1 ] , [ ibs ] , and [ ivb2 ] shows the electron current density calculated under various conditions .",
    "the current density is obtained from the integration over the incident electron energy of the transmission coefficient @xmath115 multiplied by the fermi - dirac occupation function which is almost a step function at the low temperature considered .",
    "a broadening of the landau levels up to @xmath104 mev was considered , but there were no noticeable difference in our results for the calculated currents for @xmath116 telsa since we have @xmath117 mev .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ ivb1 ] and [ ivb2 ] , the presence of small additional shoulders of almost equal width in the valley region of the current - voltage curve .",
    "these shoulders originate from that fact that the phonon - assisted resonant - tunneling peaks in the transmission coefficient are spaced by @xmath118 above the main quasi - resonant energy peak @xmath119 .    before discussing the impact of phonon scattering ,",
    "let us first briefly describe the main effects of the magnetic field upon the current of the resonant tunneling diode ( rtd ) in the absence of phonon scattering . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ivb1 ] and [ ivb2 ] the magnetic field is found to induce a shift of the onset voltage of the rtd i - v characteristic by the amount @xmath120+\\hbar w_{c0}(b)/2 $ ] , and to enhance the value of peak current of the rtd .",
    "[ ibs ] reveals another interesting feature regarding the dependence of the rtd current - voltage characteristics upon the magnetic field . in this figure",
    "the diode current is measured at @xmath121 volt which is in the current peak region of the rtd i - v curve .",
    "note that phonon scattering was not included in this calculation as coherent ( ballistic ) tunneling gives the dominant contribution to the peak current .",
    "the rtd current measured at that fixed diode voltage is seen to exhibits an oscillatory behavior versus @xmath76 which increases in amplitude as the magnetic field is increased . the current maxima observed in fig .",
    "[ ibs ] for the current versus @xmath75 are found to occur for values @xmath122 of the magnetic field satisfying the following relation @xmath123 where the quasi - resonant level @xmath124 is varying with the diode voltage .",
    "this leads to the interesting result that its periodicity versus @xmath76 which is approximately @xmath125^{-1}$ ] , depends on the quasi - resonant energy level @xmath126 ; for a smaller value of @xmath127 , one obtains an increased oscillatory behavior in the current - magnetic field curve .    as can be seen fig .",
    "[ ivb1 ] and [ ivb2 ] , the effect of phonon scattering on the rtd current density is to shift the current - voltage characteristic downward compared to the one obtained in the absence of scattering .",
    "another effect is to increase the current and to introduce additional shoulders in the valley region of the current - voltage characteristic . the downward shift of onset voltage results from the negative value of the real part of the self energy induced by the scattering of the electron by the phonons . for magnetic fields of @xmath96 and @xmath97 telsa ,",
    "the downward shifts obtained in the current - voltage characteristic are found to be @xmath128 and @xmath129 mv , respectively .",
    "the small shoulders at @xmath130 telsa in the current valley region of fig .",
    "[ ivb2 ] become larger than for the case of @xmath96 telsa .",
    "thus in stronger magnetic fields , these additional shoulders in the valley region become higher and their intervals becomes wider , which agrees with the reported experiments @xcite    to account for the origin of the shoulder at @xmath131 volt , let us consider the inset of fig .",
    "[ ivb2 ] . at @xmath130 telsa , only the two lowest landau levels @xmath132 and @xmath133 contribute to the diode current .",
    "the effective chemical potentials defined in eqn.(25 ) for the @xmath132 and @xmath133 states are respectively @xmath134 and @xmath135 mev .",
    "they are indicated by two arrows in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ivb2 ] . at @xmath131 volt ,",
    "both the peaks @xmath102 and @xmath136 of transmission coefficients for the @xmath132 and @xmath133 incident states are respectively included into the integration range of the current eqn.([cur ] ) , explaining the formation of the shoulders .    currently , it is difficult to compare our theoretical results in a quantitative way to the experiments reported in ref . 2 and 3 .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , the authors of ref . 2 concluded that additional experiments are needed to confirm the weak minima of their preliminary data in the valley current region for strong magnetic fields .",
    "second , our test device does nt have a spacer layer in the emitter region , while the device structure of ref .",
    "3 have a spacer layer where a discrete triangular well state is formed .",
    "the shoulders therein corresponding to @xmath137 beyond the main peak was reported to be as high as almost 2/5 of the main peak for extremely strong magnetic field , which were clarified to originate from the assistance of lo phonons to the electron current .",
    "our results together with ref . 2 and 3 lead to the conclusion that the spacer layer tends to enhance the strength of the shoulders beyond the main peak .",
    "but in order to explain such high shoulders , other contributions due to scatterings of electrons by interface roughness , acoustic phonon , etc . , might also be needed .",
    "in our paper we have investigated the transport of electrons interacting with lo phonons in a double - barrier heterostructure with a magnetic field applied parallel to the electric field .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field is to quantize the energy of the electron in the perpendicular plane to the magnetic field . to account for the effects of a magnetic field applied in parallel with the superlattice direction ,",
    "a 3-dimensional transport model was developed which accounts for the variation of the transverse mass and the associated variation of the cyclotron frequency across the heterostructure .    in order to determine the inter landau state transitions in the transmission probability , all the matrices @xmath90 for allowed phonon modes",
    "have been calculated numerically .",
    "it was established that the inter landau state transitions due to lo phonon scattering are as probable as intra landau state scattering .    for a fixed diode voltage in the peak region of the rtd current - voltage curve ,",
    "the rtd current versus the magnetic field was found to be a periodic function of @xmath76 .",
    "the current maxima have an @xmath76 period which is approximately given by @xmath138 .",
    "the dependence of this @xmath76 period on the quasi - resonant energy level @xmath126 of our test double barrier structure indicates that magnetotransport can be used for the spectroscopic analysis of rtds for diode voltages in the peak current region .",
    "a theory and associated numerical analysis using scattering matrix elements was presented to describe the impact of electron - lo phonon interaction in the i - v curve in the presence of both parallel electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the results obtained were found to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental results reported by ref . 2 and 3 .",
    "however for further understanding and improved quantitative fit of the weak shoulders in the valley region of the double barrier iv , more theoretical work on magnetotransport including scattering processes such as interface roughness and acoustic phonon scattering , etc . , is required in addition to lo phonon scattering studied in this paper .",
