    "<S> however several significant sets of measurements have become available since the last global analyses of the data were performed to determine the parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> the new data may be divided into two groups . </S>",
    "<S> first we have the measurements of the structure function @xmath9 for electron - proton deep - inelastic scattering for @xmath10 by the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera @xcite , and secondly the measurement of the asymmetry in drell - yan production in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions by the na51 collaboration at cern  @xcite , and of the asymmetry of the @xmath11 rapidity distributions by the cdf collaboration at fnal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two groups of measurements have quite distinct implications for the partons and are , therefore to a great extent , decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> the hera @xmath0 data offer the first constraints on partons in the previously unexplored small @xmath5 regime , whereas the two asymmetry measurements probe fine details of the quark distributions in the region @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter information is crucial , for example , for a precise determination of the mass of the @xmath7 boson at the fnal collider .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the dramatic rise of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath5 , which was first observed by the h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also shown are the extrapolated predictions for @xmath0 at @xmath13 gev@xmath14 from two parton sets ( d@xmath15,d@xmath16 @xcite made before the hera measurements became available , but which it was believed would span the data . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit , the curve d@xmath17 , was motivated by assuming the precocious onset of bfkl dynamics @xcite in which the gluon and sea quark distributions have the singular form @xmath18 as @xmath19 , whereas the d@xmath15 curve was the lower limit anticipated from conventional regge expectations with @xmath20 such extrapolations are notoriously unreliable and have failed in the past . moreover , as we will see in section 3 , the connection with precocious bfkl behaviour turns out to be more subtle than ( 1 ) would suggest . </S>",
    "<S> although d@xmath15 and d@xmath17 are the most recent published mrs sets of partons , a set mrs(h ) was subsequently made available , which was obtained from a global analysis that incorporated the measurements @xcite of @xmath0 from the 1992 hera run . </S>",
    "<S> the curve denoted by h on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is an example of the quality of the fit . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature is that the hera measurements required a small @xmath5 behaviour of the form @xmath21 higher statistics measurements of @xmath0 , obtained from the 1993 hera run , have just become available in preliminary form @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate these data in our new global analysis and in section 3 we discuss the implications for the small @xmath5 behaviour of the partons and for qcd dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the new hera data for @xmath0 are in line with the old ( i.e.  show the same rise with decreasing @xmath5 ) , and in fact the mrs(h ) partons still give an excellent fit in the hera small @xmath5 region .    the data in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 and 3 are respectively the measurement of the asymmetry in drell - yan production in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions @xcite @xmath22 and of the asymmetry of the rapidity distributions of the charged leptons from @xmath23 decays at fnal @xcite , @xmath24 in ( [ eq : ady ] ) , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the invariant mass and rapidity of the produced lepton - pair , while in ( [ lepasy ] ) @xmath28 are the differential @xmath29 cross sections for producing @xmath30 leptons of rapidity @xmath31 . also shown are the predictions of mrs(h ) and the equivalent set of partons , cteq2 m , obtained by the cteq collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that neither set of partons gives a satisfactory description of both asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this deficiency of the parton sets is not surprising . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the high - precision muon and neutrino deep - inelastic structure function data , which provide the core constraints of the global analyses , do not pin down the combination @xmath32 of parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the drell - yan asymmetry experiment was proposed @xcite as it was uniquely equipped to determine just this combination of densities . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry data therefore offer a fine - tuning of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 parton densities in the region @xmath12 , which is invaluable for the precision studies of the @xmath7 boson at fnal . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we include for the first time the asymmetry data in the global analysis ( together with the new hera measurements of @xmath0 ) and find a new set of partons , which we denote mrs(a ) . the resulting description of the asymmetry measurements is also shown in figs .  2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this aspect of the global analysis in section 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first explain , in section 2 , the procedure that we follow to determine the parton densities from a global analysis of the data . </S>",
    "<S> we give details of the new improved mrs(a ) parton distributions , and we compare them with the mrs(h ) set . </S>",
    "<S> sections 3 and 4 consider the impact of the new small @xmath5 and asymmetry data respectively . in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the ambiguities in the present knowledge of the gluon . in section 6 </S>",
    "<S> we update the predictions for @xmath7 boson and top quark production at the fnal @xmath2 collider , and finally in section 7 we present our conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> the parton distributions @xmath35 are determined from a global fit to a wide range of deep - inelastic and related data . </S>",
    "<S> the basic procedure is to parametrize the @xmath35 at a sufficiently large @xmath36 ( @xmath37 gev@xmath14 ) so that @xmath38 can be calculated at higher @xmath39 in perturbative qcd using next - to - leading order altarelli - parisi ( glap ) evolution equations . in view of the quantity and variety of data that are fitted , </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that an excellent description can be obtained with the following simple parametrization @xmath40 where the valence distributions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and where the total sea distribution @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath44 . at present </S>",
    "<S> there are not enough experimental constraints on the gluon to justify the introduction of an extra parameter @xmath45 in @xmath46 , or to determine the exponent @xmath47 independent of that of the sea - quark distribution @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> three of the four @xmath49 coefficients are determined by the momentum and flavour sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions are defined in the @xmath50 renormalization and factorization scheme and the qcd scale parameter @xmath51 is taken as a free parameter .    the flavour structure of the quark sea is taken to be @xmath52 at @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the first hint that the @xmath55 flavour symmetry of the sea is broken ( with @xmath56 on average ) came from the evaluation of the gottfried sum by nmc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact until then all global analyses had assumed @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see in section 4 , the observed drell - yan asymmetry provides further evidence that @xmath56 , which we allow through the parametrization of @xmath58 given in ( [ eq : delta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flavour breaking can be associated with the breaking of @xmath59 meson regge exchange degeneracy and so we choose the exponent @xmath60 in ( [ eq : delta ] ) to be the same as that of one of the valence quark densities .    as in earlier mrs </S>",
    "<S> parametrizations , we assume that the input strange sea is suppressed by 50% in relation to the @xmath61 and @xmath62 sea distributions  hence the factors 0.4 , 0.4 and 0.2 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sea ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first indications for such a suppression came from early deep inelastic dimuon production data , but now there is much firmer evidence for our input assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the ccfr collaboration @xcite have performed a next - to - leading order analysis of their @xmath63 data and deduce that the strange sea distributions should lie within the shaded band shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the strange sea that we find is shown by the curve denoted by mrs(a ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 and satisfies the experimental constraint .    </S>",
    "<S> the input charm sea is determined by the emc deep inelastic data for the structure function @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath65 and generate a non - zero distribution at higher @xmath39 by massless glap evolution at next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> the structure functions are also calculated using massless coefficient functions . since @xmath66 falls below our input scale , @xmath67 , we use an approximate set of partons to evolve between @xmath68 and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> taking zero charm at @xmath66 we find that the shape of the resulting charm distribution generated at @xmath70 is well described by the input parametrization of the overall @xmath48 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> as might be expected the normalization , specified by the parameter @xmath71 of ( [ eq : sea ] ) , depends sensitively on the value chosen for @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we adjust @xmath71 to give a good description of the @xmath64 data for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is shown in fig .  5 and corresponds to @xmath74 , and to a charm distribution which can be evolved from zero at @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath74 implies that , at the the input scale @xmath67 , the charm sea carries @xmath76 of the proton s momentum , as compared to nearly @xmath77 carried by the strange quark sea .    </S>",
    "<S> our prescription for the charm quark distribution is only valid far above threshold , @xmath78 . near threshold , a more rigorous treatment of quark mass effects </S>",
    "<S> is required . as discussed in detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , various prescriptions are possible . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can _ define _ heavy quark densities according to our prescription , and absorb the threshold effects into the coefficient functions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows that our treatment of the charm distribution does give a reasonable description of the emc data @xcite for @xmath64 with @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> these data do in fact lie in the region @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that our satisfactory description means that these emc data show no necessity for a small  intrinsic \" or non - perturbative charm component , as advocated by brodsky _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , except possibly for one data point at @xmath81 ( not shown ) which lies well above our fit . </S>",
    "<S> also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 are the predictions in the small @xmath5 region which are relevant for future measurements at hera . </S>",
    "<S> note that small @xmath5 implies large @xmath82 , and so our treatment should be reliable in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued @xcite that the strange sea as measured in neutrino scattering should be different from that in muon scattering on account of the different mass thresholds in @xmath83 as compared to @xmath84 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino data have been corrected by the ccfr collaboration to approximately take into account the @xmath85 effects and to allow for this difference . </S>",
    "<S> our strange and charm seas should be interpreted as those for muon data . </S>",
    "<S> our treatment of the charm sea at large @xmath5 and modest @xmath39 is suspect , but then its contribution is too small to distort the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath86-quark contribution is included by assuming that @xmath87 with @xmath88 , and non - zero contributions at higher @xmath39 generated by the same  massless \" prescription that was used for @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data that are used to constrain the parton densities are listed in table  1 , together with the leading order partonic subprocesses , which helps us to see which features of the distributions are constrained by the various data sets . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the global analysis is concerned , the core \" deep - inelastic data for @xmath90 are the bcdms @xcite and nmc @xcite measurements of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the ccfr measurements @xcite of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to inspect the leading order expressions of these structure functions in terms of the quark densities @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an isoscalar nuclear target and where , for simplicity , we have neglected the small @xmath97 quark contribution . on a @xmath98 point - by - point basis , these four observables determine four combinations of quark densities , which we may take to be @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath32 is not determined and , moreover , at leading - order it appears that the only constraint on the gluon is through the momentum sum rule .    </S>",
    "<S> .the experimental data used to determine the mrs parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the last column gives an indication of the main type of constraint imposed by a particular set of data . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     from ( [ eq : f2pmn ] ) and ( [ eq : f2ppn ] ) we see that the strange quark distribution is essentially determined by the structure function difference @xmath103 at small @xmath104 the value obtained is significantly larger than that found in the dimuon analyses that we mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> we believe the dimuon result is more reliable , as the determination based on ( [ eq : xs ] ) is very sensitive to the relative normalization of two different data sets and to the heavy target corrections that have to be applied to the neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> however it does mean that in the global analysis this discrepancy will show up in the description of @xmath105 and/or @xmath106 at small @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss the gluon distribution in more detail .    to summarize , we find that , within the global analysis , the hera measurements of @xmath0 are well fitted by a parametrization which embodies a small @xmath5 behaviour of the form @xmath207 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is consistent with the expectations of bfkl dynamics , as expressed by @xmath208 of ( [ eq : f2decomp ] ) , since this form mimics an @xmath184 behaviour in the hera @xmath5 regime under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath184 dependence is however not consistent with the grv valence `` model which gives a steeper behaviour in the hera region ( with an effective @xmath209 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach could be made consistent with the present data if a higher starting scale @xmath36 were used to decrease the evolution length . </S>",
    "<S> we also noted that very precise measurements of @xmath9 at hera will be needed to distinguish between the bfkl behaviour and glap evolution from singular '' input distributions ( motivated by bfkl dynamics ) . </S>",

    "<S> the asymmetry in drell - yan production in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions offers a direct determination of @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity can be seen from the leading - order expression @xmath216 where @xmath25 and where the partons are to be evaluated at @xmath217 ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the invariant mass and rapidity of the produced lepton pair . since @xmath218 in the proton , </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is positive for parton sets with @xmath32 zero or small , but becomes negative as @xmath32 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> when we include the recent na51 asymmetry measurement @xcite , @xmath219 at @xmath220 , in the next - to - leading order analysis , the description of the data is shown by the mrs(a ) curve in fig .  2 . </S>",

    "<S> , we expect the mrs(a ) partons to be very similar to those of mrs(h ) , except that @xmath32 would be much larger while at the same time approximately conserving @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 ( as expected from ( [ eq : f2pmn])-([eq : f3nu ] ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> the na51 measurement @xcite @xmath240 is not able to distinguish between the different sets of partons . </S>",
    "<S> however the value @xmath241 predicted using the mrs(a ) partons is consistent with the measured value .    * </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath7 charge asymmetry *    the @xmath1 charge asymmetry at the fnal @xmath2 collider @xmath242 is a sensitive probe of the difference between @xmath61 and @xmath62 quarks in the @xmath12 , @xmath243 region . because the @xmath61 quarks carry more momentum on average than the @xmath62 quarks , the @xmath244 tend to follow the direction of the incoming proton and the @xmath245 that of the antiproton , i.e. @xmath246 for @xmath247 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : f2pmn])-([eq : f3nu ] ) .    from fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , we can conclude that cteq2 m is ruled out by the data . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates the discriminating power of the cdf data , since cteq2 m is consistent with all the deep inelastic scattering data , and with the na51 drell - yan asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the cteq2 m gives a reasonable description of the nmc @xmath260 data @xcite shown in fig .  7 , a quantity which is also correlated with the @xmath261 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the reason that there is no contradiction between this and the misfit of the cdf asymmetry data is that the @xmath262 ratio is more influenced by the @xmath263 and @xmath264 distributions than is @xmath265  the former is , in a sense , _ linear _ in the small @xmath266 correction , @xmath267 , whereas the latter is _ quadratic _ : @xmath268 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the @xmath7 asymmetry is a more direct probe of the @xmath249 ratio than the @xmath262 structure function ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the  incorrect \" @xmath249 ratio of cteq2 m is compensated by the antiquark contributions in the fit to the @xmath262 ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> another place where the @xmath249 ratio is important is in the precision @xmath7 mass determination in @xmath2 collisions . because of the finite rapidity acceptance of the experiments , the lepton transverse momentum spectrum  from which the mass is determined  depends on the shape of the rapidity distribution of the @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once again the correlation is with the @xmath249 ratio , and hence the @xmath7 asymmetry can be used to rule out sets of parton distributions in the @xmath269 analysis . in fact </S>",
    "<S> it should be possible to produce sets of distributions which give  @xmath270 \" fits to the @xmath7 asymmetry data of fig .  3 , and to use these to infer a @xmath271 error on @xmath269 from parton distributions . </S>",

    "<S> the new data which we have introduced into the global analysis has enabled us to fine - tune the _ quark _ distributions . in this section </S>",
    "<S> , we comment briefly on the status of and prospects for information on the _ gluon _ distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the only precise information on the gluon distribution is that the total momentum fraction is about 43% at @xmath272 ( table  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , information on the gluon _ shape _ has come directly from large @xmath273 prompt photon production in fixed - target @xmath274 collisions , where the @xmath275 process is dominant . in particular , past and present mrs distributions </S>",
    "<S> have used the high precision wa70 data @xcite to constrain the shape of the gluon in the @xmath276 region . </S>",
    "<S> indirect information also comes from scaling violations in fixed - target deep inelastic scattering , where the gluon gives an important contribution to the @xmath39 dependence particularly at small @xmath5 . in previous studies </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have investigated the interplay between the prompt photon and deep inelastic data , and derived  @xmath270 \" gluons which attempted to span the allowed range of the distribution at medium - to - large @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we should stress that all our recent distributions , for example mrs(d@xmath277 , d@xmath278 , h , a ) , are global `` best fits '' to the data ( available at the time of the analysis ) of all the processes listed in table  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the hera measurements of @xmath0 were not available for the mrs(d ) analyses , but these data do not pin down the gluon and so d@xmath277 and d@xmath278 can be used to demonstrate the ambiguity in its behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> however the point we wish to emphasize is that the recent global analyses are `` best fits '' to the wa70 data , and so the spread of the gluons obtained underestimates the uncertainty . nevertheless , it is interesting to compare the variation in the recent mrs gluon distributions . </S>",
    "<S> figure  15 shows the d@xmath277 , d@xmath278 and a gluons at @xmath279 . </S>",
    "<S> we see immediately that there are regions in @xmath5 where these are very different ( note the logarithmic scale ) , and regions where they are quite similar . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these in turn below .    </S>",
    "<S> * at _ very small _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , @xmath280 , the size and shape of the gluon is controlled by the @xmath171 term in the starting parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> since the gluons are constrained to be similar at larger @xmath5 ( see below ) , a larger @xmath47 implies a steeper , larger gluon in the very small @xmath5 region . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in detail in section 3 , perturbative qcd ( whether manifest in glap or bfkl dynamics ) always ties the small @xmath5 behaviour of the sea quarks and gluons together , and in the mrs fits we always use the same @xmath47 parameter for both , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : starting ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spread of the d@xmath277 , d@xmath278 and a gluons in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 15 is very similar to that in the corresponding @xmath0 s at small @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that while we would expect the ratio @xmath281 to be approximately constant as @xmath282 , we can not say at which value of @xmath5 this constancy should set in . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for mrs(a ) this proportionality between the distributions is valid over a broad range of small @xmath5 , since the @xmath129 term turns out to be comparatively small in the sea - quark distribution and since there is no such parameter in the gluon distribution , i.e. @xmath283 ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : starting ] ) ) . + now that the very small @xmath5 quarks are being pinned down by the hera data , it is important to measure the gluon at small @xmath5 to look for evidence of a steeply rising distribution . </S>",
    "<S> various methods have been suggested for directly extracting the gluon distribution at hera . in the long term </S>",
    "<S> , the most promising appears to be the longitudinal structure function @xmath284 @xcite . in the meantime </S>",
    "<S> , some very rough indication can be obtained from the derivative @xmath285 which , like @xmath284 , is dominated by a term proportional to the gluon at small @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> are the first data on the @xmath0 slope from h1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the errorbars prevents any conclusions from being drawn at present . </S>",
    "<S> + the production of large @xmath273 jet pairs with large rapidity at the fnal @xmath2 collider has also been suggested as a way of probing the very small @xmath5 distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary indications appear to favour a steeply rising gluon , although a more complete study of the experimental systematic errors and of the next - to - leading order qcd corrections is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn . </S>",
    "<S> * at _ medium - large _ @xmath5 , @xmath286 , the gluon distributions in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 15 are constrained by the prompt photon data and are therefore similar . </S>",
    "<S> this is _ not _ to say that there is no uncertainty in the gluon this region  in fact quite a large spread is allowed by the errorbars on the data and by the factorization and scale dependence of the next - to - leading order qcd cross section @xcite . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , this translates into a @xmath287 uncertainty on the power @xmath116 of @xmath288 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the mrs parametrization of the gluon , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : starting ] ) , the parameter @xmath117 compensates the different small @xmath5 behaviours in , for example , d@xmath277 , d@xmath278 and a , leading to roughly equal distributions with the same parameter @xmath116 at larger @xmath5 . the larger the value of @xmath47 , the bigger is the corresponding value of @xmath117 . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting , however , that the power of @xmath288 determined by the prompt photon data at medium - large @xmath5 , @xmath290 for mrs(a ) at @xmath67 , is perfectly consistent with the naive expectation from dimensional counting , @xmath291 , which is supposed to be valid in the limit @xmath292 at some low @xmath39 scale . * the _ medium - small _ @xmath5 region , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath293 is perhaps the most interesting of all . because of </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the momentum sum rule and ( b ) the requirement of similar gluons at larger @xmath5 , and gluon distribution which is much larger at very small @xmath5 must be smaller in this region . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a cross - over point at around @xmath294 for the gluons shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 15 . </S>",
    "<S> one direct consequence of this is that , in this region of @xmath5 , structure functions such as @xmath0 evolve more slowly with @xmath39 for sets with </S>",
    "<S>  singular \" gluons at very small @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 17 , which shows @xmath295 at @xmath296 as a function of @xmath297 , with data from nmc @xcite and curves corresponding to the mrs(d@xmath277 , d@xmath278 , a , h ) and cteq2 m partons . </S>",
    "<S> the fits are , of course , constrained to be in agreement in the @xmath297 range where accurate nmc data are available . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , the divergence of the predictions as @xmath297 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is directly related to the magnitude of the gluons in this region of @xmath5 and @xmath297 , as is evident from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 18 which shows the corresponding gluons at the same value of @xmath5 , as a function of @xmath297 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the gluon on the evolution of the quark distributions at medium - small @xmath5 has important consequences for @xmath7 and @xmath298 physics at the fnal @xmath2 collider . </S>",
    "<S> this will be discussed in more detail in the following section . </S>",
    "<S> + there are , in fact , several hard scattering processes at the fnal collider which offer , at least in principle , the possibility of measuring the gluon distribution in the medium - small @xmath5 range . data on prompt photon production in the range @xmath299 has recently become available @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next - to - leading order predictions using  standard \" gluon sets give a reasonable description of the data for @xmath300 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below this value , the measured cross section rises more rapidly than the predictions , indicating an excess of data over theory . </S>",
    "<S> however this is precisely the region where ( a ) the uncertainties due to scale dependence and to matching the theoretical and experimental definitions of  isolated \" photons are greatest , and ( b ) one expects significant contributions from higher - order processes . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore it seems premature to conclude @xcite that the data indicate a steeply - rising gluon in this @xmath5 region . artifically enhancing the gluon to fit the cdf low @xmath301 data , at the same time keeping the overall gluon momentum fraction fixed , </S>",
    "<S> inevitably depletes the large @xmath5 part of the distribution , thus spoiling the fit to the wa70 data . </S>",
    "<S> + the @xmath302 cross section , being proportional to the square of the gluon distribution , is also of potential importance . </S>",
    "<S> again , unfortunately , there are substantial theoretical uncertainties arising from a large scale dependence , and experimental uncertainties in reconstructing the total cross section from the measured distributions of @xmath303 mesons , leptons , @xmath227 s etc </S>",
    "<S> . in restricted kinematic ranges , see for example ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath302 production at the fnal @xmath2 collider samples @xmath5 values ( @xmath304 ) just below the cross - over point where the various gluons have similar magnitudes , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 15 . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent indications @xcite are that while there is no serious disagreement between theory and experiment , the uncertainties are still much too large to allow any discrimination between gluon distributions at the level required by fig </S>",
    "<S> .  15 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in the gluon distribution , particularly in the important medium - small and very small @xmath5 regions . </S>",
    "<S> hera will eventually provide information on the latter , and in the meantime large rapidity jet and prompt photon production at the fnal @xmath2 collider are beginning to provide useful constraints . </S>",
    "<S> current studies tend to use sets like mrs(d@xmath277 ) and mrs(d@xmath278 ) to quantify the effect of different small-@xmath5 gluon shapes on cross section predictions , even though the corresponding quark distributions are now ruled out by the hera @xmath0 data . in a future study </S>",
    "<S> , we will explore the possibilities for varying the gluon distribution while maintaining a good fit to the structure function data .    in this section we present predictions for the total @xmath7 and @xmath305 cross sections in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath306 . </S>",
    "<S> the former is being measured more and more precisely by both cdf and d0 , and already provides a valuable cross check on the size of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> interest in the latter has recently been rekindled by the evidence for top production presented by the cdf collaboration @xcite , with the suggestion that the measured production cross section is larger than the theoretical prediction .    * ( a ) @xmath7 production cross section *    while the @xmath7 asymmetry probes the relative size of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 distributions , the _ total _ cross sections for @xmath7 and @xmath298 boson production in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath307 provide an important check of the overall magnitude of the quark distributions in a region of @xmath5 where they are constrained by deep inelastic ( mainly nmc and ccfr ) data . since the subprocess cross section is known to next - to - next - to - leading order @xcite , there is very little theoretical uncertainty in the predictions once the parton distributions are specified .    to illustrate this , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(a ) the total @xmath7 production cross section for the mrs(a , h , d@xmath277,d@xmath278 ) and cteq2 m parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the central points are calculated assuming @xmath308 and setting the renormalization and factorization scales equal to @xmath269 . </S>",
    "<S> the errorbars show the effect of changing both scales simultaneously by a factor of @xmath309 . </S>",
    "<S> the first point to note is that the @xmath265 predictions for mrs(a ) , mrs(h ) and cteq2 m are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> ( notice also that the scale dependence is weak , and gives a similar variation in cross section as the spread in the three predictions . ) </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by recalling that @xmath265 is largely determined by the product @xmath310 where @xmath311 . by comparing the relative size of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 distributions for the mrs(a ) , mrs(h ) and cteq2 m sets , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 14 , we can understand the similarity of the corresponding @xmath265 predictions shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we have that @xmath312 the situation with cteq2 m is more subtle . by comparing the @xmath61 and @xmath62 distributions at @xmath313 , we would conclude that @xmath314 whereas in fact the reverse is true . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies in the different shapes of the @xmath7 rapidity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the cteq2 m @xmath7 cross section receives a significant contribution from @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) produced at large positive ( negative ) rapidity , where a large-@xmath5 @xmath61-quark interacts with a small-@xmath5 @xmath62-quark . especially for the former , </S>",
    "<S> the cteq2 m distribution is significantly larger than the mrs(a ) distribution , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 14 , giving a distinctly different @xmath7 rapidity distribution , as shown in fig .  20 for @xmath315 . </S>",
    "<S> this is , of course , the origin of the much too large cteq2 m lepton rapidity asymmetry discussed in section  4(b ) and shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . comparing mrs(a ) and mrs(h ) , we see that the distribution in @xmath316 for the latter is slightly larger for @xmath317 , which is reflected in the total cross section shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(a ) . since the @xmath318 values and gluon distributions ( for @xmath319 , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 18 ) for these three sets are very similar , the above orderings of @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath253 simply reflect the orderings at the lower scales where the distributions are constrained by the fixed - target deep inelastic and asymmetry data discussed in the previous sections . of the three sets </S>",
    "<S> only mrs(a ) gives a consistent fit to _ all _ the data , and so we may conclude that @xmath320 is the most accurate prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth commenting on the differences between the mrs(h ) , mrs(d@xmath277 ) and mrs(d@xmath278 ) @xmath7 cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the three parton sets have similar @xmath61- and @xmath62-quark distributions for @xmath319 and @xmath39 values characteristic of the fixed target deep inelastic scattering data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , a rather large spread in the corresponding @xmath7 cross sections shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these differences arise from the different _ gluon _ distributions in the three sets . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen in the previous section that @xmath321 is precisely the region where the gluon is not well constrained . </S>",
    "<S> thus even though the quarks are accurately determined at low @xmath297 for this @xmath5 range , differences in the gluon can affect the glap evolution to @xmath253 and lead to differences in the quarks at this scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is graphically illustrated by the @xmath322 , @xmath323 and @xmath324 predictions shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(a ) . from fig .  18 , we see that the ordering of the gluons at low @xmath297 and @xmath296 is @xmath325 , and hence the quarks of d@xmath278/d@xmath277 increase more slowly / rapidly than those of h. this leads directly to @xmath326 . </S>",
    "<S> it would appear , therefore , that now that the quarks are very well constrained , it is the uncertainty in the gluon distribution around @xmath321 which constitutes the largest theoretical uncertainty in the predictions for the @xmath7 ( and @xmath298 ) cross sections at the fnal @xmath2 collider .    a precision measurement of @xmath265 at the percent level would obviously provide a useful additional constraint on the distributions . the most recent values @xcite for @xmath265 are . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath327 we should note that these cross sections relied on a luminosity measurement which has since been superceded by a new measurement of the total @xmath2 cross section by cdf @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the new values are indeed some 10% higher , as suggested by the ratio of ` new ' and ` old ' total cross section measurements , then this would bring them more into line with the theoretical predictions shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the errors on the data in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wcross ] ) are still much too big to provide the level of discrimination between the distributions discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the accuracy of the theoretical prediction suggests that the @xmath7 cross section could itself serve as a determination of the collider luminosity .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that hera will eventually be able to make a reasonably precise measurement of @xmath295 in a region of @xmath297 intermediate between the fixed target data and @xmath269 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the first data in this kinematic region have recently been presented by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite , although the errorbars are so large that no meaningful discrimination between the predictions is possible at present .    * </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath305 production cross section *    the evidence presented recently by the cdf collaboration @xcite has focussed attention on the theoretical prediction for the top quark production cross section . here </S>",
    "<S> we address the question of the uncertainty in the calculation of @xmath328 coming from parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 19(b ) shows the next - to - leading order qcd predictions @xcite for the total cross section for @xmath329  the central value reported by cdf  with the factorization and renormalization scales set equal to @xmath330 . </S>",
    "<S> the errorbars on the predictions indicate the effect of changing the scales by a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative spread in the predictions is somewhat less than for @xmath265 , since now the quark distributions are being probed in the range of @xmath331 where the high - statistics bcdms and ccfr data provide a very tight constraint . </S>",
    "<S> annihilation process accounts for approximately 90% of the total cross section for this value of @xmath330 . ] </S>",
    "<S> the more important point , however , is that unlike for @xmath265 , the dominant effect is the scale dependence . as discussed in detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this scale dependence is symptomatic of large contributions to the cross section from soft gluons at higher orders in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 21 shows the next - to - leading order prediction for @xmath332 as a function of @xmath330 using the mrs(a ) partons . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve corresponds to the scale choice @xmath333 and the dashed curves to @xmath334 . </S>",
    "<S> the data point is the cdf measurement @xcite , @xmath335 for @xmath336 .    to determine the partonic structure of the proton we have performed a global next - to - leading order analysis of the data for deep inelastic scattering and related hard - scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> we summarized the constraints from the various types of data in table  1 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a surprisingly economical parametrization of the parton densities at @xmath337 was able to give a satisfactory description of the data . </S>",
    "<S> we were able to include in the analysis for the first time significant new measurements of @xmath0 at hera , of the asymmetry @xmath238 in drell - yan lepton pair production from @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions , and of the @xmath1 rapidity asymmetry @xmath338 at fnal . </S>",
    "<S> the partons that we obtain  </S>",
    "<S> mrs(a )  are the only set which are consistent with all the data . </S>",
    "<S> ( the only exception which remains is the incompatibility with the lowest @xmath5 measurements by ccfr of the neutrino structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath339 . )    </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry data considerably tighten the constraints on the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the na51 measurement of @xmath238 provides a missing link and pins down the combination @xmath340 , which is essentially undetermined by the deep - inelastic structure function measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of the @xmath1 lepton rapidity asymmetry , @xmath338 , provide a tight constraint on the ratio @xmath249 with @xmath263 and @xmath264 having less influence .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature to emerge from the analysis is the link between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 distributions at @xmath341 and @xmath321 , which determine the @xmath7 cross section at fnal , and the @xmath61 and @xmath62 densities determined from the fixed - target data with @xmath342 . even for @xmath5 as large as @xmath343 , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution from @xmath344 to @xmath345 depends appreciably on the gluon distribution , particularly in the initial stages of the evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of @xmath0 at hera have opened up the small @xmath5 regime , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic growth of @xmath0 observed with decreasing @xmath5 , which had been anticipated in perturbative qcd models , is readily accommodated in the global fit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we found that the observed small @xmath5 behaviour is entirely consistent with the precocious onset of bfkl leading @xmath6 dynamics , although alternative qcd explanations are not ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our analysis has considerably improved the detailed knowledge of the quark densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same is not true for the gluon distribution . at present </S>",
    "<S> there are , with the possible exception of the wa70 prompt photon measurements , no reliable direct constraints on the gluon . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath302 and jet production cross sections depend directly on the gluon density , but ambiguities  due to scale dependence , jet recognition , higher - order effects , the choice of @xmath346 etc . </S>",
    "<S> mean that so far these data have provided little additional information on the gluon . </S>",
    "<S> valuable indirect constraints on the gluon come from the momentum sum rule and from the observed structure of the deep - inelastic scaling violations . </S>",
    "<S> our philosophy has been to keep the parametrization of the partons as economical as possible , and to only introduce an extra parameter when it is required to improve the description of the data . for this reason the parametrization of the gluon is remarkably simple , such that its behaviour is prescribed by the momentum sum rule and the optimum fit to the wa70 prompt photon data . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not surprising that the gluons from the various sets of partons are quite similar above @xmath347 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this does not reflect the true ambiguity in the gluon distribution , but rather it is an artefact of our economical parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> we will attempt to address this problem in a future publication . </S>",
    "<S> we will also evolve our distributions to lower @xmath39 , below @xmath67 , and study the interplay of leading and higher twists , and hence provide a phenomenological representation of @xmath0 at low @xmath39 .    for the future , we foresee a continued improvement in our knowledge of the partons . </S>",
    "<S> the increasingly precise measurements of @xmath0 at hera , particularly at low @xmath5 and low @xmath39 ( @xmath348 ) may help to distinguish between bfkl and glap dynamics and may even reveal the onset of shadowing behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> so far the drell - yan asymmetry has only been measured at @xmath220 . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves considerable ambiguity in the structure of @xmath259 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the asymmetry measurement by a forthcoming experiment at fnal @xcite will cover an extended @xmath5 interval and are eagerly awaited . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the @xmath1 rapidity asymmetry measurements at fnal will improve and thus provide extremely tight constraints on the behaviour of @xmath249 in the @xmath5 region around @xmath343 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino measurements at low @xmath5 are under further study by the ccfr collaboration and the discrepancy with the nmc measurements may be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> a change may effect the relative normalization between the data sets  an improvement here would be of great value . finally , detailed studies of @xmath227 , @xmath349 , @xmath302 , prompt photon and jet production at fnal and hera , together with measurements of the longitudinal structure function @xmath284 , will help reduce the ambiguity in the gluon distribution .    </S>",
