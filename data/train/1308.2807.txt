    "dissipative solitons , which originate , in the spatial domain , from the simultaneous balance between diffraction and self - focusing , and between gain and loss , are the subject of fundamental importance in optics  @xcite and plasmonics  @xcite .",
    "an obvious condition necessary for the stability of dissipative bright solitons is the stability of the zero solution , i.e. , background around the soliton",
    ". this condition may be satisfied by linearly coupled complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations  wg1 , which describe dual - core waveguides , with the linear gain applied to the active core , while the parallel - coupled passive one is lossy  dual , pavel , chaos , marini .",
    "the stability of dissipative solitons can be also provided by the single cgl equation including the linear loss , cubic gain and quintic loss , as shown in detail in many earlier works @xcite and some recent ones @xcite .    lately",
    ", considerable attention was drawn to another method of the creation of stable localized dissipative modes , using linear gain localized at a hot spot \" ( hs )  @xcite .",
    "configurations with multiple hss  @xcite , as well as with extended amplifying structures  @xcite , have been introduced too .",
    "such settings can be created by implanting gain - producing dopants into one or several narrow segments of the waveguide  @xcite , or by focusing an external pumping beam at the target spot(s ) in a uniformly - doped waveguide .",
    "solutions for dissipative solitons pinned to narrow hss approximated by delta - functions have been found in an analytical form hsexact , spotsexact1,spotsexact2 .",
    "more sophisticated one- and two - dimensional localized modes , such as vortices supported by the gain acting in a ring - shaped area  @xcite , have been found in the numerical form  @xcite .    a natural setting for the implementation of the hs",
    "is provided by discrete systems , i.e. , lossy multi - core waveguiding arrays , where the gain is applied to a single selected core .",
    "assuming that the nonlinearity is also concentrated at the pumped core , while the bulk of the array is linear , exact solutions for modes pinned to the hs in such a system were recently found in an implicit analytical form in ref .",
    "@xcite , and stability boundaries for the solutions were identified in a numerical form , in the parameter plane of the linear gain and cubic loss ( or gain ) acting at the hs . in particular",
    ", it was demonstrated that the pinned modes may be _ stable _ , under the combined action of the _ unsaturated _ cubic gain ( in the absence of quintic losses ) and cubic self - defocusing nonlinearity , which is impossible in uniform dissipative media ( but possible in the case of the localized unsaturated cubic gain acing in a continuous medium @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it was demonstrated that the interplay of the linear gain , cubic loss , and cubic self - defocusing nonlinearity in the same system gives rise to a bistability , which is a noteworthy effect too .",
    "the next natural step is to consider the discrete system with two mutually symmetric hss embedded into it , which is the subject of the present work .",
    "previously , symmetric modes pinned to a pair of symmetric nonlinear sites implanted into a linear lattice were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and exact solutions for stable asymmetric modes in the same system , generated by a symmetry - breaking bifurcation , were recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the discrete cgl equation with the embedded double hss , and",
    "its implicit analytical solutions for pinned modes are introduced in sec .",
    "numerical results , which include the linear - stability analysis of the analytically found stationary solutions and direct simulations of the underlying discrete cgl equation , are reported in sec .",
    "iii . because the system features the competition between the gain and loss , direct simulations converge to attractors .",
    "in particular , the simulations allow us to identify stable modes into which unstable analytically found ones spontaneously transform .",
    "the paper is concluded by sec .",
    "we consider the transmission of optical or plasmonic waves in a discrete array of linear lossy waveguides , with two identical nonlinear pumped cores ( alias hss ) embedded into it : @xmath0where  @xmath1 is the propagation distance , @xmath2 the number of the waveguiding core , @xmath3 the complex amplitude of the electromagnetic field in it , @xmath4 the linear - loss parameter , and the coefficient of the linear coupling between adjacent cores is scaled to be @xmath5 .",
    "further , @xmath6 is the linear gain applied at the two hss , which are represented by cores with numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( both numbers are integer ) , @xmath9 is the attractive potential which may be a part of the hs , @xmath10 or @xmath11 characterize the self - focusing or defocusing kerr nonlinearity acting in the active cores , and @xmath12 is the coefficient of the cubic loss . in light of the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the discrete array with the single embedded hs , we focus below on the self - defocusing nonlinearity , fixing @xmath13 , as otherwise the pinned modes are prone to be unstable .",
    "we present the analysis separately for the cases of odd and even numbers of sites separating the two hss .",
    "numerical simulations of eqs .",

    "the equations at the edge sites ( e.g. , at @xmath15 in this example ) were solved dropping the fields corresponding to nonexisting sites ( i.e. , formally setting @xmath16 in the above - mentioned case ) .      to model the scenario with an odd number of sites between the two hss , we set in eq .",

    "specifically , a pair of complex - conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis into the right ( unstable ) half - plane .",
    "the hopf bifurcation naturally leads to periodic oscillations , i.e. , transformation of the unstable stationary mode into a persistent breather , which keeps the overall double - peak structure , see an example in the bottom row of fig .",

    "[ fig8 ] , is qualitatively similar to the one displayed in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , also being an antisymmetric mode corresponding to ansatz ( [ anti ] ) .",
    "further , the evolution of unstable solutions belonging to the high - amplitude branch leads to the establishment of two fully isolated narrow peaks , see examples in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , which is similar to the outcome of the instability development observed in the bottom row of fig .",
    "the instability of these solutions is accounted for by an isolated positive eigenvalues in the linear spectrum , and the emerging stable modes , which feature the isolated peaks , belong to the stable high - amplitude segment , which exists at the same parameter values .",

    "stable modes exist solely in the region of @xmath68 .",
    "note that , as it follows from the second equation in system ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) , the corresponding wavenumber @xmath69 in ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) is zero for stable solutions , and @xmath70 for unstable ones , i.e. , the modes with _ staggered _ tails , corresponding to @xmath71 , are unstable ( in the numerical solution , @xmath69 can converge to @xmath72 with other integer values of @xmath73 , but they all are tantamount to @xmath74 or @xmath5 ) . the top row of fig .",

    "secondary structures are generated in the course of the evolution as a result of the emission of lattice waves ( phonons \" ) .",
    "the positive eigenvalue in the spectrum is a signature of the instability .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , since @xmath76 or @xmath71 when @xmath67 , the real and imaginary parts of the last equation in  system ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) give @xmath77where the plus and minus signs correspond to @xmath76 and @xmath78 , respectively . these equations can be combined to yield @xmath79one can solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : exact1 ] ) for linear gain @xmath46 in terms of @xmath48 , and , subsequently , the remaining solution parameters . @xmath25 and @xmath80 , can be easily found from  the other equations of system ( eq : sym1 ) .",
    "we have also studied the linear stability of solutions obtained in the form of ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz2 ] ) , whose parameters were found from a numerical solution of reduced system  ( [ eq : sym2 ] ) .",
    "for the same parameters as adopted above ( i.e. , @xmath81 , @xmath13 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) and in the presence of the background loss ( @xmath84 ) , it has been found that the solution branches and their stability resemble those reported in the previous section ( which is quite natural , as the two - peak modes of the two types should be close for the numbers of the intermediate sites @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , therefore we do not discuss the results for @xmath87 in detail here .",
    "it is relevant to point out that , in the case of @xmath67 ( no background loss ) , one can again obtain an explicit relation between the linear gain @xmath46 and the inverse width @xmath48 , which is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : exact1 ] ) : @xmath88here , as before , the plus and minus signs correspond to @xmath76 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "a specific particular case is the one when the two hss are set at adjacent sites of the lattice , without intermediate sites between them ( @xmath89 ) , which corresponds to @xmath90 in eqs .",
    "( [ n ] ) and ( eq : ansatz2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows examples of stationary solutions for this case .",
    "obviously , their shape does not feature distinct peaks , in contrast with the profile depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . however , the stability is similar to that for @xmath91 , stable solutions being found for small and large values of @xmath46 , while breathers are observed at intermediate values of @xmath46 , as a result of the hopf bifurcation , see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "we have introduced an analytically tractable discrete dissipative model , in which stationary modes are supported by a symmetric pair of embedded hss ( hot spots ) , represented by two sites carrying the linear gain , self - defocusing nonlinearity , and cubic loss .",
    "the system can be readily implemented in photonics and plasmonics , using waveguiding arrays , with the gain and nonlinearity applied to two cores , which are chosen as hss .",
    "symmetric solutions were obtained in an implicit analytical form , separately for odd and even numbers of intermediate sites between the two hss , @xmath92 and @xmath87 .",
    "the latter case includes the configuration with adjacent hss ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the modes with @xmath92 feature both the simple shape , with a minimum at the center , and the w - shaped one , with an additional lower peak at the central point .",
    "the linear stability of the stationary solutions was investigated  in the numerical form , which has revealed both stable and unstable portions of the solution families . in most cases",
    "when the instability is accounted for by isolated real positive eigenvalues , direct simulations demonstrate that the unstable mode spontaneously evolves into a stable one , which can be found at the same parameter values .",
    "however , in some cases the evolution transforms unstable symmetric modes into apparently antisymmetric stable solutions .",
    "the instability represented by a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues gives rise to persistent breathers .",
    "the same model may give rise to antisymmetric solutions , detailed results for which will be reported elsewhere ( here , it has been found that some unstable symmetric modes evolve into stable antisymmetric ones ) .",
    "a challenging issue , which will be studied separately too , is to search for asymmetric modes , with unequal amplitudes at the positions of the two symmetric hss .",
    "another challenging direction is to extend the analysis for a similar two - dimensional system .",
    "a partial financial support for this project has been provided by the university of hong kong incentive award scheme .",
