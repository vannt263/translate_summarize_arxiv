    "active brownian particles ( abps ) provide a simple , minimal model system with which to study the collective behavior of active matter .",
    "many - body brownian dynamics simulations of these systems have provided considerable insight into a range of interesting nonequilibrium phenomena , such as the accumulation of particles at boundaries  @xcite and motility - induced phase separation  @xcite .",
    "much of the phenomenology of abps can be captured using coarse - grained , hydrodynamic theories  @xcite , however , these approaches are based on general physical arguments which do not enable a direct connection to be made to the microscopic interparticle interactions .",
    "although some progress has recently been made in this direction  @xcite , this remains work in progress .",
    "due to the inherent difficulty of dealing simultaneously with both the translational and orientational degrees of freedom in active systems , attempts to develop a first - principles theory have largely focused on a simpler , related model , in which the particle dynamics are represented by a set of coupled ornstein - uhlenbeck processes ( oups ) . within this model an exponentially correlated noise term , with a given correlation time , serves as proxy for the persistent trajectories of abps ( connections between the two models were explored in ref .  ) .",
    "while the removal of orientational degrees of freedom does indeed simplify the problem , it comes at the cost that one has to deal with the non - markovian dynamics of the translational coordinates .",
    "fortunately , there exist approximation methods @xcite which enable the oup model to be represented using an effective markovian , and therefore tractable , dynamics .",
    "there are two different approaches to doing this , ( i ) the unified colored noise approximation ( ucna ) of hnggi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on adiabatic elimination on the level of the langevin equations , ( ii ) the fox approximation @xcite , for which an approximate fokker - planck equation is developed .    when applied in the context of active matter , both the ucna and fox approximations",
    "are referred to as ` effective equilibrium ' approaches , owing to their markovian character .",
    "indeed , the possibility of mimicking the behavior of nonequilibrium abps using an equilibrium system of passive particles , interacting via _ effective _ interactions , was suggested by several researchers ( see e.g. @xcite ) who observed that the phase separation induced by activity in systems of repulsive abps closely resembled that familiar from passive systems with an attractive interaction . despite its appeal ,",
    "several years were required before this observation could be turned into something more concrete . by starting from the simpler oup model it became possible , via application of the ucna and fox approximations , to put the notion of an effective equilibrium description on a firmer footing @xcite .    in this paper , we will compare and contrast the two different approaches to effective equilibrium .",
    "we will highlight the main approximations involved and assess the validity of the effective - potential approximation ( epa ) , which has been employed in previous work to investigate activity induced modifications of the microstructure and motility - induced phase separation  @xcite .",
    "this analysis both clarifies the nature of the approximations involved and suggests ways in which the description can be improved .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : in sec .",

    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the common starting point of both the ucna and fox approach . since particles driven by gaussian colored noise originally were not intended as a model for an active system , the choice of parameters in the literature may depend on the dimensionality and on whether contact to abps is made  @xcite or not  @xcite .",
    "we will also clarify some notational issues .",
    "we consider the coupled stochastic ( langevin ) differential equations @xmath0 of @xmath1 particles .",
    "the motion of each particle @xmath2 at position @xmath3 is determined by conservative @xmath4 and stochastic forces @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the friction coefficient @xmath7 is related to the translational brownian diffusivity @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the inverse temperature .",
    "we assume that the total interaction force @xmath10 can be written as the gradient of a pairwise additive many - body potential @xmath11 consisting of the one - body external fields @xmath12 and the interparticle potentials @xmath13 .",
    "the vector @xmath14 represents the translational brownian diffusion by a gaussian ( white ) noise of zero mean and @xmath15 with the unit matrix @xmath16 . here and in the following the dyadic product of two vectors with @xmath17 components results in a @xmath18 matrix .",
    "any contraction as in a scalar product or a matrix - vector product will be explicitly indicated by a `` @xmath19 '' .",
    "the oups @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 with @xmath22 describe a fluctuating propulsion velocity as a non - gaussian ( colored ) noise of zero mean and @xmath23 here we introduced the active time scale @xmath24 at which the orientation randomizes and the active diffusion coefficient @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the average squared self - propulsion velocity and @xmath17 the spatial dimension .",
    "the colored - noise model for active particles contains two parameters describing the magnitude and persistence of the self propulsion .",
    "we now aim to clarify some notational differences in the literature .",
    "the persistence time @xmath24 can be explicitly related to the equations of motion of run and tumble particles  @xcite or active brownian particles  @xcite .",
    "the above definitions correspond to the latter case with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the rotational brownian diffusion coefficient .",
    "another common choice  @xcite amounts to consider @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the following , we use @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the typical dimension of a particle and the dimensionless persistence time @xmath33 has been introduced in refs .",

    "we also recover a passive ( non - brownian ) system , as the velocity correlation   reduces to a white noise . in order to connect to an active brownian system  @xcite , it is convenient to consider instead of @xmath38 a dimensionless velocity @xmath39 , i.e. , the peclt number . in the literature ,",
    "some other definitions of a peclt number are used , which we will not consider here .",
    "the most important step towards a theoretical study of the oups model is to derive from the non - markovian stochastic process an equation of motion for the @xmath1-particle probability distribution @xmath40 . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the differences between the multidimensional generalizations of the ucna  @xcite and the fox  @xcite approaches to effective equilibrium and expound the surprising similarities between these two approximations in the ( current - free ) steady state .    as a central quantity emerging in both cases , we define the @xmath41 friction tensor @xmath42}$ ] with the components @xmath43 resulting in the hessian of @xmath44 and the diagonal @xmath18 block @xmath45 not to be confused with @xmath46}({{{\\mathbf{\\stringr } } } } _ 1)$ ] for @xmath47 particle . in the following ,",

    "the fox approximation scheme applied to , on the other hand , only makes use of the correlator of the oups , which , in turn , may also be interpreted as the correlator of @xmath54 corresponding to a coarse - grained equation of motion representing active brownian particles with a constant velocity @xmath55 in the direction of their instantaneous orientation @xmath56 that is subject to brownian rotational diffusion  @xcite .",
    "this method directly yields the approximate smoluchowski equation ( superscript @xmath57 )  @xcite @xmath58 where the regime of validity is the same as for ucna .",
    "the major difference between eq .   and   only affects the effective description of the dynamics as a result of the additional factor @xmath59 arising on the level of the langevin equation within the ucna .",

    "was obtained as @xmath60 , which we will later identify as the _ ( diagonal ) laplacian approximation_. it will turn out that this ( or another ) approximation is necessary to obtain physical expressions for the effective interaction potentials .",
