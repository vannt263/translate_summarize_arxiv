    "the spinel vanadates , @xmath4 , are interesting materials which lay at the heart of several distinct topics in condensed matter physics . in recent years , the focus has been geometric frustration , and the role played by the vanadium orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom in relieving the significant spin frustration inherent to the spinel structure@xcite . in insulating vanadates containing divalent @xmath5-site cations , the octahedrally coordinated",
    "@xmath6 comprise a pyrochlore sublattice with @xmath7 spins and an orbital triplet degeneracy in the ideal cubic crystal field environment .",
    "when the @xmath8 cation is non - magnetic , this degeneracy is relieved at a jahn - teller structural transition from cubic - to - tetragonal global symmetry , followed by an antiferromagnetic spin order transition upon cooling@xcite . in materials @xmath9@xcite and @xmath10@xcite , the @xmath5-site also contains a spin , and @xmath11 superexchange interactions stabilize a form of collinear spin order , before orbital order transitions simultaneously distort the cubic structure and ca nt spins at lower temperatures .",
    "@xmath0 is a unique case .",
    "though a collinear ferrimagnetic transition near @xmath12 = 150 k@xcite has long been observed and there have been recent reports suggesting a weaker spin canting transition near @xmath13 = 90k@xcite , the material is reported to retain cubic global symmetry to lowest measured temperatures@xcite .",
    "this last observation is especially interesting , as it contradicts all known models for this class of materials .",
    "we discuss it in more detail below .",
    "enhanced spin - lattice coupling and associated phenomena resulting from orbital order have been reported on several occasions , and theory has predicted a number of different ordering patterns@xcite . given the difficulty of accessing the orbital order parameter experimentally , conclusions have been argued indirectly , and debate has centered on the relative importance of exchange , spin - orbit coupling and various crystal field terms in the magnetic hamiltonian .",
    "a secondary line of debate has focussed on whether localized orbital models are appropriate at all , or whether one should approach the problem from the itinerant limit for some materials@xcite .",
    "indeed , the spinel vanadates were initially studied in the context of localized - itinerant crossover physics , and are predicted to be metallic for v - v separations ( @xmath14 ) less than the critical distance of @xmath15 = 2.97@xcite .",
    "though known materials are all semiconductors , those with @xmath16 ( e.g. @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath0 ) have enhanced electron - lattice coupling and transport properties best described by the hopping of polarons@xcite .",
    "the activation energy of polarons is seen to decrease sharply ( i.e. materials become more metallic ) with decreasing @xmath14@xcite and increasing pressure@xcite , but increase with disorder due to cation inversion@xcite or mixed valence on the spinel b - site@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 , which has the shortest @xmath14 , has been driven metallic over a limited temperature range with an applied pressure of 6 gpa@xcite .",
    "recent studies have expounded on the role played by the proximate itinerant state .",
    "one study showed that , although materials @xmath19 and @xmath9 are well described by insulating models , the @xmath20 compound exhibits anomalously high compressibility which has been argued to signify a breakdown of the mott - hubbard picture@xcite . materials with shorter @xmath14 ( @xmath21 ) may lay in an intermediate phase , characterized by partial delocalization , mobility of large polarons and short - range magnetic order@xcite .",
    "these arguments seem to be backed by first principles calculations in @xmath0 , which suggest the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons@xcite , and electronic structure calculations in @xmath18 , which explain the low - temperature transitions as a structural instability toward v - v dimerization , with no role for local orbitals@xcite .",
    "the role of orbital order in near - itinerant vanadates was further challenged by studies of the doping series @xmath22 , where x - ray and heat capacity measurements reveal the suppression of the low temperature tetragonal phase transition above critical doping @xmath23@xcite and neutron scattering reveals the decoupling of this transition from spin canting@xcite .    in light of the above discussion , the case of @xmath0",
    "is particularly intriguing .",
    "this material is a direct analogue to @xmath9 , forming a near ideal spinel structure with @xmath6 on the pyrochlore lattice and spin - only s=3/2 @xmath24 on the @xmath5-site .",
    "its near critical v - v separation has made it the subject of several studies exploring the role of the proximate itinerancy in 3d magnet systems@xcite .",
    "though it is well - established that there exists a magnetic transition to a near collinear ferrimagnetic ordered state below @xmath25@xcite , the experimental situation at lower temperatures is quite unclear . while one study of @xmath0 powders reported a cusp in magnetization near t = 100 k and a sharp peak in heat capacity at t = 60 k@xcite , similar measurements of a single crystal sample revealed only a magnetic anomaly at t = 75 k and no signature in heat capacity at any temperature below @xmath12@xcite",
    "neither study saw a deviation from cubic symmetry down to t = 10 k@xcite , which itself is surprising , as both orbital order@xcite and dimerization models@xcite predict a symmetry lowering structural transition .",
    "very recently , a neutron and strain study of crystals and powders enriched with excess cobalt reported a spin canting transition @xmath26 , which they associated with the onset of an orbital glassiness , and a separate structural transition of unknown origin near t = 40 k@xcite .",
    "the large variation in the literature is likely a reflection of the combined weakness of observed effects and the enhanced sensitivity of this material to disorder .",
    "the differing heat capacity signatures in powders and crystals has been ascribed to the presence of random fields in crystals@xcite , as seen in @xmath27@xcite , or could simply reflect the difficulty in detecting first order transitions in heat capacity using the time - relaxation technique , as suggested elsewhere by us@xcite .",
    "weak inversion , and in particular cobalt on the spinel @xmath28-site , is known to affect both the temperature of transitions@xcite and the degree of localization@xcite in this system .",
    "in fact , early magnetization measurements noted a feature near 60 k , which seemed to disappear upon annealing and was attributed to the presence of @xmath29@xcite .",
    "clearly , further measurements are needed before reaching final conclusions .    in this article , we shed light on the outstanding questions surrounding @xmath0 using a combination of neutron powder diffraction and inelastic scattering .",
    "our diffraction results confirm the near cubic spinel structure with minimum cation inversion , and canted ferrimagnetic order below @xmath30 .",
    "significantly though , our analysis further reveals the presence of a weak , first - order structural phase transition at @xmath31 = 90 k , the same temperature at which a spin canting transition is reported in ref .  .",
    "this transition is evident in the temperature evolution of both the lattice parameter , seen on long length - scales , and the oxygen atom positions , which has a short - range character .",
    "our inelastic data show the success of local spin models in describing the magnon spectrum , and suggest the presence of a small ( 1.25 mev ) spin gap .",
    "together , these observations strongly suggest that this material is most appropriately described by local orbital models , and indicate an orbital ordering transition at @xmath32 .",
    "proximate itinerancy is manifest primarily through a strong reduction of vanadium ordered moments , canting angle and the magnitude of the structural distortion .",
    "powder samples of @xmath0 were prepared via solid state reaction at the national high magnetic field lab in tallahassee , fl , and extensive characterization data can be found on related samples in refs .   and .",
    "as discussed above , these references report a near cubic structure to lowest temperatures and the formation of a net ordered moment below 150k , reflecting the ferrimagnetic spin order known from previous neutron measurements@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering data in the current report was obtained entirely using instruments at oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) in oak ridge , tn .",
    "powder diffraction work was performed using the hb2a instrument at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir)@xcite , followed by wide - angle time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements using the nanoscale - ordered materials diffractometer ( nomad ) instrument at the spallation neutron source ( sns)@xcite .",
    "hb2a measurements were performed using @xmath333 g of powder , placed in a vanadium can with helium exchange gas to ensure cooling .",
    "patterns were measured independently with @xmath34and @xmath35   neutrons from a germanium monochromator , and fit simultaneously . for nomad measurements , about 100 mg of sample",
    "was measured in 6 mm diameter vanadium cans for 20 minutes in an ill orange cryostat .",
    "nomad detectors were calibrated using scattering from diamond powder , and the instrument parameter file for the rietveld refinements was obtained from the measurements of the nist standard silicon powder . the structure factor s(q ) was obtained by normalizing diffraction data against a solid v rod , and subtracting the background using the idl routines developed for the nomad instrument .",
    "the pair - distribution function ( pdf ) was obtained by the fourier transform of s(q ) with q@xmath36 = 31.5@xmath37 :    @xmath38    rietveld refinements were performed using fullprof@xcite , and pdf fits were performed using the pdfgui software@xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements were performed using the hybrid spectrometer hyspec at the sns .",
    "hyspec is a highly versatile direct geometry spectrometer that combines tof spectroscopy with the focusing bragg optics@xcite .",
    "the incident neutron beam is monochromated using a fermi chopper with short , straight blades , and is then vertically focused by bragg scattering onto the sample position by highly oriented pyrolytic graphite .",
    "hyspec employs 3he linear position sensitive tube detectors that are assembled into 20 sets of 8-packs that cover an angular range of 60@xmath39 in the horizontal scattering plane and a vertical acceptance of 15@xmath39 . for the ins measurements ,",
    "the @xmath0 powder was loaded in an aluminium can and placed in a closed cycle refrigerator capable of reaching a base temperature of 5 k. data was collected with incident energies ei = 60 mev , 35 mev , 15 mev and 7.5 mev , and fermi chopper frequencies of 300 hz , 180 hz , 180 hz and 420 hz , respectively .",
    "neutron powder diffraction measurements were first performed using the hb2a instrument with two neutron wavelengths , and main results are shown in figure  [ fig : hb2a ] . figs .",
    "[ fig : hb2a ] ( a.)-(c . ) shows patterns from 1.54   measurements at t = 280 k , 115 k and 4 k , along with lines showing best - fit rietveld refinements , performed using both wavelengths .",
    "refinement of the pattern at t = 280 k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hb2a](a ) ) confirms the near ideal spinel structure , with approximately 4@xmath40 of the vanadium sites containing cobalt cations .",
    "patterns at lower temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hb2a](b)-(c ) ) exhibit a visible increase in the intensity of several low - angle peaks associated with collinear ferrimagnetism , most prominently the cubic ( 111 ) . targeted measurement of this peak over a range of temperatures resulted in the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : hb2a](d ) , and simple power - law fits yield a transition temperature of @xmath41 and a power @xmath42 .",
    "consistent with other neutron powder diffraction studies@xcite , we saw no visible intensity at the position of the cubic ( 200 ) bragg peak associated with spin canting , yet refinements of the entire patterns to a model with @xmath24 spins along the @xmath43-axis and @xmath6 spins allowed to ca nt along @xmath44110@xmath45 from the antiparallel direction implied a small canting angle at base temperature .",
    "specifically , at t = 4 k , best fits give ordered moments @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote ordered vanadium moments antiparallel and perpendicular to @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the value for @xmath51 is within error equal to the expected full - moment value for s=3/2 @xmath24 .",
    "the fitted values for @xmath49 and @xmath52 within our model imply a greatly reduced vanadium moment of @xmath53 , with a canting of @xmath54 .",
    "though the fitted canting angle is not significantly different from zero , this result is consistent with the reports of canting in ref .   for co - rich samples and ref .",
    "for near itinerant members of the series @xmath55 .",
    "a complete listing of refinement parameters for each of the four measured temperatures is listed in table  [ table : hb2a_params ] .",
    "   at temperatures t = 280 k ( a. ) , 115 k ( b. ) and 5 k(c . ) . here",
    ", black dots are data and solid lines are the results of rietveld refinements described in the main text .",
    "arrows denote the position of the cubic ( 111 ) bragg reflection , which serves as an order parameter for the collinear ferrimagnetic state .",
    "a power law fit to the temperature variation of this peak ( d. ) gives @xmath41 . ]",
    ".parameters extracted from simultaneous rietveld refinements of npd patterns taken using @xmath56   and @xmath57   neutrons on the hb2a instrument at hfir .",
    "details about the fit model are provided in the main text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , plotted on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the simulated scattering data is the result of a spin - wave analysis , using parameters described in the main text and using spherical approximations for the local form factors of @xmath58 and @xmath59 moments .",
    "effects of instrument resolution have not been included . ]",
    "collectively , the neutron scattering results presented here draw a clear and consistent picture for the physics underlying @xmath0 .",
    "the most striking new result is the first order structural phase transition at @xmath2 = 90k , which by itself addresses the largest outstanding question in the study of this material- namely the unexpected preservation of the high symmetry cubic phase to lowest temperatures . here , we see that the predicted symmetry lowering transition is not absent , but has merely been suppressed in magnitude to @xmath60 , presumably another effect of the near - itinerancy",
    ". the subtlety of the transition and our inability to resolve details of the low symmetry structure does not allow us to strictly determine whether it is driven by orbital order@xcite or an instability towards homopolar bond formation@xcite . if one takes into account , however ,",
    "previous reports of spin canting at the same temperature@xcite and the small spin gap seen in powder inelastic data at base temperature , the experimental situation surrounding @xmath0 is strongly reminiscent of other ferrimagnetic spinels more unambiguously described by the mott insulating picture@xcite .",
    "thus , it seems most appropriate to describe the 90 k transition in @xmath0 as an ordering transition for localized @xmath59 orbitals . in further support of this idea ,",
    "we note that our successful description of inelastic scattering invoked a localized spin hamiltonian , and used parameters which imply a strong anisotropy in heseinberg exchange parameters .",
    "this magnetic anisotropy echoes previous reports of an anisotropic compression in single crystals@xcite . without a much larger tetragonal distortion than what we are reporting ,",
    "the most natural way of explaining these experimental signatures is though an emergent electronic anisotropy , such as one expects in an orbitally ordered state .    on a final note",
    ", we point out that our data allows us to rule out any additional structural or spin transitions below @xmath31 , within the sensitivity of our probe .",
    "this is in direct contrast to reports of transitions at 40 k@xcite , 60 k@xcite or 75 k@xcite , seen in both powders and single crystals .",
    "we believe the variation on this point in the literature is largely a result of the difficulty in preparing pure samples of this material and its peculiar sensitivity to disorder .",
    "it is known that the most frequent impurity phase in the preparation of @xmath0 is @xmath61 , which is strongly correlated and has transition temperatures which are sensitive to level of defects@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is also known that the presence of excess cobalt on the vanadium site strongly affects the degree of localization in this material@xcite , drives changes in n@xmath62el temperature@xcite , and has led to at least one report of a transition between 45 k and 70 k which disappears upon annealing@xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that enhanced sensitivity to disorder as materials approach the itinerant crossover affects both the level of localization@xcite and might further explain the many reports of glassy correlations and dynamics@xcite .",
    "x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements on our samples reveal no detectable impurity phases and a cation inversion ( @xmath63 ) that is among the lowest in the literature , which increases confidence in our results .",
    "a systematic multi - sample study will probably be required , however , to disentangle complicated disorder effects in this material and discern the true number of transitions .    in summary , we have presented strong evidence for a structural phase transition in @xmath0 at a temperature of @xmath64 .",
    "this transition , coupled with previous reports of spin canting and the presence of a spin gap , lead us to believe that this material is best described by a local orbital ordering picture , though it is certainly possible that ferrimagnetic bond formation is playing a role .",
    "we suggest that the main effects of the nearby itinerant state are the strong reduction of the magnitude of the structural distortion , the reduction of the vanadium ordered moment and canting angle associated with the orbital order , and the modification of the magnetic form factor , indicative of a near delocalized spin distribution .",
    "confirmation of these interpretations could come from future pressure experiments , where the known insulator - metal transition should completely suppress the reported structural transition and spin gap .",
