    "<S> the optical conductivity measurements give a powerful tool to investigate the nature of the superconducting gap for conventional and unconventional superconductors . in this article , first , general analyses of the optical conductivity are given stemmed from the mattis - bardeen formula for conventional bcs superconductors to unconventional anisotropic superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> second , we discuss the reflectance - transmittance ( r - t ) method which has been proposed to measure far - infrared spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the r - t method provides us precise measurements of the frequency - dependent conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> third , the optical conductivity spectra of the electron - doped cuprate superconductor nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 are investigated based on the anisotropic pairing model . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the behavior of optical conductivity is consistent with an anisotropic gap and is well explained by the formula for d - wave pairing in the far - infrared region . </S>",
    "<S> the optical properties of the multiband superconductor mgb@xmath3 , in which the existence of superconductivity with relatively high-@xmath4 ( 39k ) was recently announced , is also examined to determine the symmetry of superconducting gaps . </S>"
