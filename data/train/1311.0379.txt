    "this was the main initial motivation for this work . from a mathematical point of view , this constitutes an example of an even @xmath5-index theorem resulting from the pairing of a projection with an even fredholm module .",
    "while details are referred to secion  [ sec - topins ] , one issue is worth stressing already here in the introduction .",
    "wigner has shown @xcite that time - reversal symmetry in quantum mechanical systems is implemented by complex conjugation combined with either @xmath2 or @xmath74 as above , depending on whether the spin of the system is half - integer or interger ( see section  [ sec - topins ] ) .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry of a bounded hamiltonian @xmath97 is then respectively    @xmath98 namely precisely odd or even symmetry of the hamiltonian . by proposition  [ prop - algebra",

    "based on prior works @xcite , hamiltonians describing two - dimensional topological insulators are an example of this kind ( see section  [ sec - topins ] ) .",

    "the implications of a non - trivial @xmath5-invariant for odd time - reversal symmetric systems is discussed .",

    "therefore @xmath433 provide a splitting of @xmath411 into two subspaces @xmath439 and @xmath440 which are mapped onto each other under the time - reversal operator @xmath441 .",
