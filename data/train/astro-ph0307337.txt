    "type i supernovae are currently objects of intense interest . the observed luminosity of type ia supernovae ( snia ) out to high redshift offers some of the most convincing evidence for the acceleration of the universe due to an unknown dark energy ( garnavich et al 1998 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the distance redshift relation for the snia standard candle is also an important component in the determination of the present cosmic expansion rate ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) . as such , it is important to carefully scrutinize any possible variations in the paradigm for snia explosions which might occur at large redshift . in this paper",
    "we explore one such possible new mechanism for snia s .",
    "type i supernovae are characterized by the absence of hydrogen lines in their spectrum .",
    "type ia supernovae , in particular , are believed to result from the accretion of material onto the surface of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf .",
    "if the accretion rate is sufficiently rapid , mass accumulates until the star approaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "as the interior density exceeds the threshold for pycnonuclear reactions , an off - center runaway deflagration / detonation wave of thermal carbon burning ignites under strongly degenerate conditions . since the degeneracy pressure support of the core is almost independent of temperature , the heating of the core does not cause the star to expand and cool .",
    "therefore , carbon burning rates increase until a thermonuclear explosion eventually engulfs a significant fraction of the star .",
    "the key to this paradigm is that the density at some time exceeds the threshold for thermonuclear ignition . for typical type ia models the ignition density ranges from @xmath5 g @xmath6 ( at a temperature @xmath7 k ) with the lower range of ignition density favored by nucleosynthesis arguments ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new mechanism by which the ignition density of a white dwarf can be achieved .",
    "we show that relativistic enhancements of the self gravity of a white dwarf occur whenever the star is accelerating in a background gravitational field . as the velocity with respect to the background field approaches a significant fraction of the speed of light ( as will occur near a black hole )",
    "these relativistic effects can cause the central density to exceed the threshold for nuclear ignition even for white dwarfs which are well below the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "alternatively , the ignition densities might be achieved by the excitation of tidally - induced resonance / disruption ( khokhlov & melia 1996 ; rathore & blanford 2000 ) within the white dwarf , or tidal compression by the carter - luminet effect ( carter & luminet 1982 ; laguna , miller & aurek 1994 ) . in any of these scenarios ,",
    "the result is the same , i.e. the ignition of a thermonuclear explosion in a deep gravitational well .",
    "the focus of the present work , however , is on the relativistic compression effect ( wilson & mathews 2000 ; wilson 2002 ) .",
    "we note that other authors have modeled hydrodynamic effects which occur as stars encounter a black hole .",
    "for example , fryer et al . ( 1999 ) have considered the tidal disruption of a white dwarf near a low mass black hole as a source of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "their simulations were based upon newtonian hydrodynamics which would not incorporate the general relativistic effect described here .",
    "similarly , ayal , livio , and piran ( 2000 ) have simulated the tidal disruption of a normal solar type main - sequence star near a massive ( @xmath8 m@xmath1 ) black hole . extended main sequence stars indeed should tidally disrupt before the relativistic effects described here can induce compression .",
    "the effect described here is unique to compact objects such as white dwarfs or neutron stars and is only apparent in a fully relativistic simulation .",
    "we consider three possible environments in which such events might occur .",
    "these are : 1 ) white dwarfs orbiting a low - mass black hole ( hereafter lmbhsn ) ; 2 ) white dwarfs encountering a massive ( @xmath9 m@xmath1 black hole in a globular cluster ( hereafter mbhsn ) ; and 3 ) white dwarfs passing a supermassive ( @xmath10 m@xmath1 black hole in a dense galactic core ( hereafter smbhsn ) . in what follows",
    "we utilize general relativistic hydrodynamic numerical simulations described in sections 2 and 3 to determine the conditions under which the central density can be made to exceed the ignition threshold for these three paradigms . in section 4",
    "we then make a rough analysis of the event rates at which these various scenarios might occur .",
    "we conclude with some discussion as to how such events might be identified observationally .",
    "it has been noted in studies of colliding ( wilson 2002 ) and orbiting ( mathews & wilson 2000 ) neutron stars that general relativistic effects can overwhelm the stabilizing tidal forces and cause the central density of compact objects to increase . this phenomenon was shown ( mathews , marronetti & wilson 1998 ; mathews & wilson 2000 ) to scale with the magnitude of the spatial component of the four velocity of the star relative to the background field for conditions in which there exists no killing vector by which the three - velocity can be made to vanish .",
    "here we point out that these conditions are also met for white dwarfs orbiting or passing near a black hole .",
    "thus , a similar scaling of interior density with four velocity should be expected for the case of white dwarfs accelerating under the influence of the gravitation potential of a massive black hole .",
    "we show by numerical calculations that the increase of central density is sufficient to induce a thermonuclear runaway and lead to a new class of type i supernovae .",
    "these supernovae are unique in that they would most likely be found in association with a black hole . the case of mbhsne or smbhsne",
    "would also be associated with dense globular clusters or galactic cores , respectively .",
    "they would also be distinguished from the usual type ia event in that they may involve a less massive white dwarf and a rapid ignition / detonation in their centers .",
    "we analyze the induced compression in the context of a general relativistic treatment of the hydrodynamic and field evolution of a white dwarf in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "although an orbiting system is inherently nonaxisymmetric , the essential features of this system can be modeled ( with slight modifications ) while imposing axisymmetry .",
    "the implementation of axisymmetry does not lead to significant inaccuracies , but it allows us to rapidly explore a broad range of parameter space for white - dwarf plus black - hole systems as follows .",
    "an exact axisymmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic model has been previously developed by wilson ( 1979 ; 2002 ) ( see also hawley , smarr & wilson 1984 ) to describe the head - on collision of two neutron stars . here",
    "we have modified this model to treat the essential features of a white - dwarf plus black - hole system .",
    "we start with the adm formalism ( arnowitt , deser & misner 1962 ) whereby , the metric is split into space - like and time - like components @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lapse function , @xmath13 is the shift vector , and @xmath14 is the metric for the three - space ( we use geometrized units .",
    "@xmath15 ) . for the present purposes ,",
    "we are concerned with either quasi - stationary orbits or passing orbits near the point of closest approach . in either case , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 metric components are very small for the systems of interest here and can be neglected in what follows . in a full nonaxisymmetric treatment , the dominant contribution to the shift vector will be from nonaxisymmetric motion about the rotation axis of the orbit plane .",
    "nevertheless , an axisymmetric model can still be maintained by modified hydrodynamic equations as described below .",
    "in essence there are two effects of orbital motion on the shift vector : in a comoving gauge ( wilson & mathews 2003 ) the dominant contribution is from an overall rotation of the coordinates .",
    "the explicit inclusion of this term naturally generates the appropriate centrifugal and corriolis forces associated with a rotating coordinate system .",
    "there is also a small lense - thirring frame - drag correction ( wilson , mathews & marronetti 1996 ) for the relativistic orbit precession .",
    "the frame - drag component can be deduced from an equation of the form , @xmath18 ( wilson & mathews 2003 ) . for the systems of interest here ,",
    "the source term is small so that frame - drag is only a small correction to the orbital motion .",
    "this is consistent with numerical results for neutron - star binaries near their last stable orbit ( mathews & wilson 2000 ) .",
    "hence , for our purposes the frame - drag can be neglected .",
    "the coordinate rotation term can be eliminated by choosing an instantaneously nonrotating coordinate system at the orbit periapse and adding effective centripetal force terms to the equations of motion as described below .",
    "thus , for this application we adopt a quasi - eulerian ( @xmath19 ) gauge ( wilson & mathews 2003 ) .",
    "we further adopt a conformally flat metric whereby @xmath20 .",
    "this has been shown ( cook et al .",
    "1993 ; mathews & wilson 2000 ; wilson 2002 ) to be sufficiently accurate for our purpose .",
    "thus , in cylindrical coordinates we write an effective metric , @xmath21~~,\\ ] ] where in what follows we take the @xmath22 coordinate to be the distance along the line of centers between the black hole and the white dwarf .",
    "the @xmath23 coordinate is the radius perpendicular to the @xmath22 axis .",
    "this metric leads ( wilson , mathews & marronetti 1996 ; wilson 2002 ; wilson & mathews 2003 ) to simple poisson - like elliptic constraint equations which can be solved to find the the conformal factor and lapse function .",

    "we use a standard white dwarf equation of state ( e.g. salpeter 1961 ; hamada & johnson 1961 ) to specify @xmath29 and/or @xmath34 as a function of density . for simplicity",
    "we only retain the dominant degenerate electron part .",
    "in equations ( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho2 ] ) the extrinsic curvature @xmath35 terms result ( wilson & mathews 2003 ) from derivatives of the relativistic frame drag contained in the @xmath13 . in close neutron - star binary systems",
    "it has been shown ( mathews & wilson 2000 ) that this term contributes insignificantly to the metric source terms , ( @xmath36 ) . in what follows these extrinsic curvature terms can therefore be neglected . including these terms",
    "would only slightly enhance the compression effect described below .      to model a white dwarf near a black hole",
    ", a centrifugal term is added to the axisymmetric momentum equations to keep the stars apart .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic equations are slightly modified from those presented in ( wilson 2002 ; wilson & mathews 2003 ) the momentum equation becomes , @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\sigma { u_\\bot^2 \\over z } \\delta_{i z }   = 0~~ , \\label{hydromom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and the covariant coordinate momentum density is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ hydromom ] ) is a centrifugal acceleration .",
    "it accounts for the conserved motion along an unspecified third coordinate perpendicular to @xmath22 . obviously , setting this term to zero recovers the simple head on collision .",
    "if this term is sufficiently large , it can stabilize the stars in orbit , or it can limit motion along @xmath22 to a distance of closest approach .",
    "it is to be noted that this component must be included in the @xmath41 summations above and in the metric fields .",
    "for example , at closest approach , @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the inclusion of this term increases the source terms [ cf .",

    "as noted above , we consider several possibilities in this study .",
    "one is a white dwarf in a bound orbit around a low - mass black hole .",
    "this situation could result , for example , from the evolution of a binary in which one member was a massive progenitor which formed a black hole .",
    "alternatively , a white dwarf might be captured by a black hole through three - body interactions in a dense cluster . in either case",
    ", the white dwarf orbit would decay by gravitational radiation until it approaches high orbital velocity .",
    "another possibility is that of a white dwarf randomly passing a massive @xmath52 m@xmath1 black hole in a dense globular cluster or galactic core .    to start each calculation an initial distribution of density and internal energy",
    "is taken ( e.g.  a white dwarf in hydrostatic equilibrium ) and with initial velocities corresponding to either nonradial infall from infinity , or of an amount required to stabilize the orbit , i.e.  an angular momentum is chosen to present a centrifugal barrier . in the case of a simple bound circular orbit , this term was simply adjusted to keep the white dwarf at a fixed distance from the black hole . for the case of passing orbits",
    ", this term was chosen to produce a particular distance of closest approach .",
    "the stars were then evolved and the central density monitored until the white dwarf was either tidally disrupted , attained the critical density for thermonuclear burn , or passed the distance of closest approach .    for our purposes , a thermonuclear runaway is conservatively expected to initiate once the density exceeds @xmath53",

    "the two entries of a 1.2 m@xmath1 white dwarf orbiting a low mass black hole , however , are just below our adopted ignition density .",
    "all of the stars in table 1 have large tidal distortion even though their central density is quite high .",

    "these figures are for a typical 0.6 m@xmath1 white dwarf passing near various massive black holes .",

    "hence , these stars are significantly compressed .",
    "the black hole resides at @xmath98 km below these figures as noted in the captions .",
    "all three cases have been chosen because the white dwarf just achieves the ignition threshold in its center near the point of closest approach to the black hole .",
    "these therefore represent the maximum impact parameter for which explosion can occur .",
    "figure [ wdfig1 ] is for a white dwarf near a 1000 m@xmath1 black hole . in this case , the white dwarf is substantially tidally distorted .",
    "nevertheless it has compressed ( by more than a factor of 1000 in density and a factor of 10 in radius ) so that the center reaches the ignition threshold .",
    "figure [ wdfig2 ] is for a 1500 m@xmath1 black hole .",
    "it shows less tidal distortion since it reaches the central ignition density farther from the star .",
    "similarly , figure [ wdfig3 ] for a white dwarf even farther from a 3000 m@xmath1 black hole exhibits almost no tidal distortion at all .",
    "these figures clearly illustrate that for such systems , the tidal forces ( which tend to decrease the central density ) are not strong enough to prevent an increase in central density as the white dwarf approaches the black hole .    from these simulations",
    "the following conclusions can be made regarding this paradigm :    * substantial increases in central density can occur as a star passes close to a black hole . for example",
    ", the central density of a @xmath99 m@xmath1 white dwarf in isolation is @xmath100 g @xmath6 .",
    "this density is increased by nearly a factor of @xmath101 when passing a massive black hole . *",
    "the ignition density can be achieved for smaller velocities for white dwarfs that are closer to the chandrasekhar mass . * for low - mass black holes , pycnonuclear ignition requires the orbit to be relatively close ( @xmath102 km ) , i.e comparable to the radius of the white dwarf",
    ". also , the white dwarf must be in the high end of the observed mass distribution , @xmath103 m@xmath1 .",
    "however , for a black hole of @xmath104 m@xmath1 sufficient compression can occur even for a 0.6 m@xmath1 white dwarf , and ignition can occur much further from the black hole where tidal effects are minimal ( cf .",
    "[ wdfig3 ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the most likely environment for this effect is in a dense galactic core or globular cluster in which there is a good chance that a white dwarf can pass relatively close to a massive or supermassive black hole .",
    "it is important to have an estimation of the rates of such new events relative to those of normal snia s .",
    "the observable event rate for normal snia explosions out to a redshift of @xmath105 is rather significant @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the number of galaxies out to @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the average rate per galaxy at which carbon - oxygen white dwarfs accrete enough material to exceed the critical interior density for the ignition of an explosion . this rate is observed to be about 1 per century per galaxy ( kobayashi et al .",
    "it is instructive , however , to review how one estimates this rate theoretically :    if we adopt the current view that type ia supernovae arise from the binary accretion of material onto a white dwarf .",
    "there are two scenarios which have been debated in the literature ( nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ; kobayashi et al 2000 ) .",
    "the most widely adopted from a theoretical modeling point of view ( and the one that will be adopted here ) is that of a single degenerate white dwarf which accretes hydrogen via mass transfer from a normal red giant or main sequence companion .",
    "if the mass transfer is sufficiently rapid , the interior density rises to the ignition density before material can be ejected via normal nova eruptions . a second possibility ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; 1985 ) is that of a doubly degenerate carbon - oxygen white - dwarf binary .",
    "the eventual merger of the two white dwarfs leads to a single system of order the chandrasekhar mass which can ignite and explode .",
    "the relative rates of either of these paradigms can be deduced from the relative probability of having a close interacting binary . for this",
    "we utilize a slightly modified version ( mathews , bazan & cowan 1992 ) of an expression first proposed by greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) .",
    "@xmath110 where @xmath111 is the initial mass function ( imf ) for a binary of total mass , @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the distribution function for the ratio of the secondary to primary mass , @xmath114 , @xmath115 is the distribution of initial separations , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the star formation rate corrected for the evolutionary time @xmath118 for the secondary star to evolve to a white dwarf and for the binary to evolve to a supernova . as in ( mathews , bazan & cowan 1992 )",
    "we take @xmath119 with @xmath120 , since distributions with exponents @xmath121 give incorrect ratios of single lined to double lined spectroscopic binary systems ( kraicheva _ et al .",
    "this favors mass - symmetric systems .",
    "the initial separation distribution is taken by similar arguments ( tutukov & yungelson 1979 ) to be @xmath122 , which favors close systems .",
    "the upper and lower limits to the mass integral are simply the largest and smallest total binary mass , respectively , allowed by the scenario and evolutionary time scale . for a single degenerate white dwarf snia , one typically has , @xmath123 m@xmath1 and @xmath124 m@xmath1 as the carbon - oxygen white dwarf progenitor .",
    "this implies , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "the limits on the separation distance are determined by the presumed scenario for type ia supernovae as discussed above . for our purposes ,",
    "the lower limit @xmath129 au is determined ( mathews et al .",
    "1992 ) by the requirement that the stars not be too close during the common - envelope asymptotic - giant - branch phase ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; 1985 ) of the white dwarf progenitor to prevent the formation of a co white dwarf .",
    "one might think that a white dwarf orbiting a common low - mass black hole could be the most likely candidate for this event .",
    "after all , a number of candidate binary systems have been identified ( cowley 1992 ) which probably contain a black holes as one member .",
    "indeed , mass transfer from a close companion star is the primary means to identify a black hole candidate .",
    "hence , it seems quite likely that a number of close binary systems exist in which the higher - mass progenitor star has evolved to a black hole while the lower - mass member is now a white dwarf . in this case",
    ", the inspiraling of the white - dwarf companion is an inevitable outcome and the possibility of a compression - induced explosion needs to be considered .",
    "here , we estimate the rate of such events relative to normal snia events . we find that this is a possible , though rare , phenomenon .    the relative rate of exploding white - dwarf , black - hole binaries compared to that of normal type i supernovae can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ rsn1a ] ) . ignoring the logarithmic dependence on relative separation , and assuming instantaneous recycling along with a salpeter imf ,",
    "the ratio of rates becomes : @xmath130_{lmbhsn } \\over [ m_l^{-1.3 } - m_h^{-1.3}]_{sn1a } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & { [ q_{max}^{x+1 } - q_{min}^{x+1}]_{lmbhsn } \\over [ q_{max}^{x+1 } - q_{min}^{x+1}]_{sn1a}}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] adopting the parameters above for the carbon - oxygen white dwarf progenitor , and progenitor masses for a low - mass black hole in the range of @xmath131 , we have @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 for the lmbhsn scenario . setting @xmath136 then implies a most optimistic rate of @xmath137 requiring that the white dwarf have a mass @xmath103 m@xmath1 and that the progenitor star produce a black hole with @xmath138 m@xmath1 ( as indicated in table 1 ) will decrease this rate by at least another order of magnitude .",
    "hence , we conclude that this type of supernova is probably much less frequent than normal type ia supernovae .",
    "the main reason is the simple fact that the high - mass progenitors of a black hole are more rare than the low - mass progenitors which can produce snia s .",
    "also , the required massive white dwarfs are rare , and the required binary systems with a high mass asymmetry are less common .",
    "the other plausible candidate environments for the explosion scenario considered here are those of white dwarfs on passing orbits near a massive ( @xmath139 m@xmath1 ) black hole in the center of a globular cluster or a supermassive ( @xmath140 m@xmath1 ) black hole in a dense galactic core .",
    "we show here that is possible for event rate in these environments to be greater than the event rate due to low - mass black - hole / white - dwarf binaries .",
    "supermassive black holes , for example , appear to be present in every galaxy .",
    "they also tend to be found in high density stellar environments in which a large encounter rate is possible .      at the present time",
    "there is no firm observational evidence for massive black holes in globular clusters ( gcs ) even though much effort has been expended searching for them .",
    "although there have been recent claims ( e.g. gebhardt , rich & ho 2002 ; van der marel et al .",
    "2002 ) for their detection , it has since been demonstrated ( cf .",
    "baumgardt et al .",
    "2003 ; ferraro et al . 2003",
    "; mcnamara 2003 ) that conventional interpretations ( without a massive black hole ) can match the observations equally well .",
    "hence there is no firm empirical basis to conclude that most globular clusters harbor an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "nevertheless , there are plausible theoretical arguments as to why such objects should exist in at least a fraction of globular clusters ( miller & hamilton 2002 ; zheng 2001 ) . for example , a strong correlation has been noted ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) between core black - hole masses and the dispersion velocity in the central bulge of the galaxies . observed black - hole masses scale ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) as , @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 for @xmath144 km s@xmath145 .",
    "it has been shown ( adams et al .",
    "2003 ) that this scaling simply follows because collapse to the black - hole mass is halted once the centrifugal radius of the collapse flow exceeds the capture radius of the central black hole .",
    "a similar collapse should account for formation of any spherical stellar system .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to extrapolate this relation to globular clusters .",
    "for the 22 milky - way globular clusters considered in ( zheng 2001 ) @xmath146 would have implied black hole masses of the order of @xmath101 m@xmath1 , but with a large uncertainty since a long extrapolation is required .",
    "this fraction is also consistent with the fraction inferred ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) from the observed luminous point sources in several starburst galaxies .",
    "assuming that massive black holes exist in at least some gcs , the rate at which white dwarfs pass sufficiently close to a massive black hole to produce observable supernovae out to cosmological distances is given by a combination of factors , @xmath147 where @xmath107 is the number of galaxies out to @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the average number of globular clusters per galaxy , and @xmath150 is the fraction of those clusters which contain a black hole with @xmath104 m@xmath1 .    for globular - cluster black holes ,",
    "the rate @xmath151 at which white dwarfs pass sufficiently close to explode can be written , @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the density of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs around the black hole .",
    "the quantity @xmath154 is the average white - dwarf gravitational cross section times the virial velocity distribution in the dense environment near the black hole .",
    "equation ( [ lambdawd ] ) assumes an isotropic distribution of stars and a relaxation time for the system @xmath155 the rate of black - hole encounters .    the gravitational cross section @xmath156 can be written in terms of a maximum asymptotic impact parameter @xmath157 , @xmath158 such that a white dwarf passes close enough to the black hole for its density to exceed the pycnonuclear ignition threshold .",
    "first , let us estimate the cross section @xmath156 . a white dwarf infalling from a large distance will have a specific angular momentum : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the tangential velocity component of the white dwarf at a large distance from the black hole .",
    "the specific mass - energy is given by @xmath161  .",
    "this gives @xmath162 now , at closest approach @xmath163 , @xmath164 which can be solved for the impact parameter @xmath157 to give : @xmath165 now inserting , @xmath166  , leads to @xmath167 for the cases of interest in tables 2 and 3 , @xmath168 is small at the distance at which the ignition density is reached and can be ignored .",
    "solving this for @xmath169 and substituting @xmath170 , gives the desired cross section as a function of @xmath160 for the white dwarf , @xmath171 for the black hole , and the @xmath51 at which the star can explode , @xmath172 equivalently , one can write the cross section in terms of the distance of closest approach , @xmath173    let us consider a typical globular cluster ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) with a core radius of 1.5 pc , a core density of @xmath174 m@xmath1 pc@xmath175 , and a core virial velocity of @xmath176 km s@xmath145",
    ". even at high redshift , the core is likely to be dominated by white dwarfs with a mass distribution peaked around 0.6 m@xmath1 but with a broad distribution extending up to 1.2 m@xmath1 ( silvestri et al .",
    "we have determined the rate at which supernovae of this type are ignited per globular cluster by integrating eq .",
    "( [ lambdawd ] ) over a thermal distribution of white dwarf velocities normalized to a virial velocity of @xmath176 km s@xmath145 .",
    "the velocity dependent gravitational cross section was taken from eq .",
    "( [ sigma2 ] ) with an average for @xmath163 taken from the results of table 2 weighted by the mass distribution of silvestri et al .",
    "we determine in this way a rate of @xmath177 sne per year per massive black hole in a globular cluster .",
    "hence , the use of eq .",
    "( [ lambdawd ] is justified since our estimated black - hole encounter rate is less than the median core relaxation time derived for gcs in the milky way ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    the number of galaxies out to a redshift @xmath105 can be obtained by integrating the galaxy luminosity function and is approximately @xmath178 .",
    "the number of globular clusters per galaxy is a strong function of the parent galaxy luminosity ( vandenbergh 1997 ) .",
    "for example , in @xmath179 there are @xmath180 globular clusters while the milky way only contains about 150 .",
    "since globular clusters are destroyed over time , it is quite possible the the low number of gcs in the milky way is atypical .",
    "if we take the number of gcs around @xmath179 as more realistic , then there could be more than @xmath181 globular clusters out to a redshift of @xmath105 .    as of",
    "yet there are no confirmed globular clusters which contain a massive black hole in the milky way .",
    "nevertheless , as argued above it is at least possible that a fraction of gc s contain an as yet undiscovered massive black hole .",
    "therefore , we allow for the possibility that @xmath182 .",
    "the whole sky rate for this class of supernova then becomes @xmath183 although this estimate ( like that for lmbhsns ) is smaller than the observed ( @xmath184 yr@xmath145 ) type ia supernova rate out to large redshift , it could be much greater if for example , the average number of globular clusters per galaxy were larger in the past .",
    "hence , even for @xmath185 , we conclude that this class of supernova event may be detectable .",
    "we next estimate the rate for the explosion of white dwarfs on passing orbits near supermassive black holes in a galactic centers .",
    "such systems may be natural candidates for the events described here .",
    "for one , it appears that almost any moderate size galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its core ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) with a mass ranging from @xmath186 to @xmath187 m@xmath1 ( gebhardt et al . 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is well know that quasars and agn s are absorbing of order 1 to 10 m@xmath1 of material per year , and that there is a very high stellar concentration around the central supermassive black hole .",
    "for example the modest @xmath188 m@xmath1 sgra@xmath189 black hole in the milky way has an observed mass concentration after subtracting the black hole ( ghez et al .",
    "1998 ; genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) of @xmath190 m@xmath1 pc@xmath191 where r is the angular distance from sgra@xmath189 in arcseconds ( 1 pc @xmath192 24 \" in the galactic center ) . in the inner cusp",
    ", the density can exceed @xmath193 m@xmath1 pc@xmath191 .",
    "although many of these stars appear to be members of a young stellar population ( figer 2000 ; gezari et al .",
    "2002 ) , it seems likely that these young stars are the result of mergers from older stars ( schdel et al .",
    "hence , a comparable population of white dwarfs could be present .",
    "we conservatively estimate @xmath194 pc@xmath191 around the black hole with an average velocity dispersion of @xmath195 km s@xmath145 .    in the case of a galactic center ,",
    "equation ( [ lambdawd ] ) can not be used to estimate the steady state rate at which stars fall into the bh .",
    "this is because stars on eccentric orbits that bring them close enough to the bh to be destroyed ( `` loss - cone '' orbits ) are depleted rapidly on a dynamical time scale .",
    "subsequently , the rate is set by the much slower diffusion time - scale of stars from bh - avoiding orbits into radial orbits . here",
    "we will apply the loss cone model as discussed in syer & ulmer ( 1999 ) and magorrian & tremaine ( 1999 ) .    in this model",
    "the two - body relaxation timescale for a spherical cluster of stars of mass @xmath196 with a density @xmath197 and an isotropic density dispersion @xmath198 is given by , @xmath199 where @xmath196 is the typical stellar mass and @xmath200 includes dimensionless factors of order unity as well as the coulomb logarithm . following binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) and syer & ulmer ( 1999 )",
    "we then can write a numerical value of : @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the number of stars within the characteristic radius @xmath203 and @xmath156 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion ( seyer & ulmer 1999 ) given as @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the logarithmic slope of the density .",
    "the white dwarf capture rate will then be given by the rate at which white dwarfs will scatter into the loss cone . @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the number density of white dwarfs @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the mass fraction in white dwarfs and @xmath210m@xmath211 is the mean white - dwarf mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath212 is the angular size of the `` loss cone '' where @xmath213 is the radius at which stars are removed from the system .",
    "the density profile @xmath197 divides into inner and outer regions .",
    "the black hole dominates the gravity in the inner region so that a density profile of the form @xmath214 and a dispersion velocity , @xmath215 is expected . in the outer region on the other hand",
    "one expects flatter density and velocity - dispersion contours .",
    "based upon the analysis of syer & ulmer ( 1999 ) ( cf .",
    "their figure 4 ) we estimate @xmath216 for a typical white dwarf mass of @xmath99 m@xmath1 . however , based upon the range and uncertainties in the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath156 , @xmath203 , and m@xmath217 we expect a range in @xmath151 from up to an order of magnitude above to a couple of orders of magnitude below this number . for purposes of discussion",
    "we will adopt @xmath218 as a reasonable estimate .",
    "the total rate of such events out to @xmath105 will be given by a similar combination of the factors to those given above in eq .",
    "( [ rlmbh ] ) , @xmath219 where again , @xmath220 is the number of galaxies out to @xmath148 and @xmath221 is the number of supermassive black holes per galaxy .",
    "the quantity @xmath151 is again the rate at which white dwarfs are making sufficiently close passes to a black hole .",
    "the total rate is then of order 10@xmath175 to a few @xmath222 yr@xmath145 .",
    "this rate is somewhat less than normal sn1a s which are observed at a rate @xmath184 yr@xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , a large fraction of such events might be hidden in the dense regions surrounding galactic cores .",
    "nevertheless , this crude estimate is at least suggestive that such events could be frequent enough to be observed .",
    "it is conceivable that they might even dominate over normal type ia supernovae at sufficiently large redshift where newly formed galactic cores have not yet depleted their radial orbits .",
    "frequent white dwarf encounters with a supermassive black hole might even provide a power source for agns and quasars .",
    "clearly , if such explosions occur , a search for observed signatures seems warranted .",
    "having proposed this class of new supernovae it is worth commenting on several distinguishing characteristics which might help observers identify whether one of these events has actually occurred .",
    "preliminary numerical burn simulations ( d. dearborn , priv . comm . ) of 0.6 m@xmath1 white dwarfs passing a supermassive black hole indicate a nearly complete burn of initial c / o into ni / co .",
    "hence , each supernova should indeed generate @xmath223 erg in kinetic energy of matter and @xmath224 erg in optical light .",
    "the optical signal , however , may be unique for several reasons .",
    "one obvious feature is that these supernovae should most likely be seen in association with a galactic core ( or possibly a globular cluster ) .",
    "indeed , a number of transients that might be such supernovae near galactic cores have been observed ( n. suntzeff , priv .",
    "out to large redshift , but are often not analyzed due to the complication of their location in a crowded field .",
    "we suggest that in the near future , the development of the national virtual observatory ( cf .",
    "hanisch 2002 ) might be utilized to search for a possible association of unusual type i supernovae with galactic cores and/or extragalactic globular clusters .    among other things to look for",
    "is the fact that the stars are moving very fast when they explode .",
    "hence , they could exhibit a large doppler shift in their spectra .",
    "also , the explosion itself should be different , since the stars are of lighter mass and undergo a very rapid rapid compression / ignition .",
    "normal type ia events are expected to undergo an off - center ignition after a gradual approach to the ignition density .",
    "the events described here , however , will probably ignite rapidly and at their centers .",
    "this will cause a detonation and a possibly more efficient thermonuclear burn of the white dwarf ( depending upon tidal effects from the black hole ) .",
    "thus , one might expect a different burn front , a different light curve , and different nucleosynthesis yields ( e.g.  more iron and reduced silicon ) compared to normal snia events .",
    "another distinguishing characteristic of these explosions is that they occur in the strong field of a companion black hole .",
    "hence , there might be an affect on the light curve from matter accreting into the black hole and/or impinging on the accretion disk .",
    "for example , the accretion of sn debris onto the black hole might produce excess x - ray ( or even @xmath225-ray ) emission .",
    "we suggest two possible observational consequences of the smbhsne , depending upon the optical depth of the material in the accretion disk down to the location where the supernova occurs .",
    "if the optical depth to the point of explosion is greater than one , then since the scale of the systems is so large , energy will be emitted from the system over a timescale of a year or more .    in the case",
    "that the optical depth is less than one then the usual sn light signal will be seen . however , if there is an accretion disk present , then the sn light signal will be augmented by radiation emitted from the collision of the sn remnant with the accretion disk .",
    "let us consider order - of - magnitude estimates for the radiation emitted as debris from the explosion of a 0.6 m@xmath1 white dwarf impinges on the accretion disk of a @xmath187 solar mass black hole .",
    "for this we will assume that the accretion disk is flat .",
    "that is , we ignore the thickness of the accretion disk near the black hole .    from table 3 , the distance from the black hole to the point at which the explosion initiates is typically about @xmath226 cm ( roughly ten black hole schwarzschild radii ) .",
    "we take this as a measure of the distance from the supernova to the accretion disk .",
    "the expansion velocity of the supernova shell is given by @xmath227 cm s@xmath145 .",
    "hence , the time scale for material to reach the accretion disk is of the order @xmath228 sec .",
    "the time for peak luminosity of a type - i supernova is also about @xmath186 sec .",
    "thus , the peak supernova signal and the start of the thermal radiation from the collision of the supernova remnant with the accretion disk will typically occur at about the same time",
    ".    the peak temperature from the collision shock will be about 400 kev .",
    "the electrons and baryons will come to equilibrium temperatures quickly .",
    "then bremsstrahlung radiation will cool the hot gas on a timescale of about @xmath229 sec .",
    "most of the remnant will not hit the accretion disk perpendicularly .",
    "averaging the various physical quantities over the angle of impact we estimate a mean photon energy of about 30 kev .",
    "the time for the photon spectrum to fall below 10 kev will be about @xmath230 sec",
    ". the total emitted x - ray energy will be @xmath231 ergs .",
    "thus , an x - ray burst in coincidence with a supernova explosion deep inside a galaxy is what we expect to possibly be observed .      as another observed signature , it is possible that remnants from this type of supernova may be detectable in the galaxy .",
    "for example , an event rate of a few @xmath232 y@xmath145 per galaxy for white dwarfs to approach and explode near the giant black hole in galaxy centers , suggests that it is worthwhile to search for a supernova remnant with an age @xmath233 y near the giant black hole sgra * in the galactic center . for a remnant moving with a typical dispersion velocity of 100 km s@xmath145 for @xmath229 y",
    ", one would expect to find such a remnant @xmath234 1 pc from sgra*.    in this regard , it is certainly of interest that indeed such a remnant ( sgra east ) exists and has been recently analyzed ( maeda et al .",
    "2002 ) with the acis detector aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. this remnant is centered at a distance of @xmath235 pc from sgra*. in fact , sgra * is within the remnant outer rim .",
    "the passage of the supernova shell sometime in the past may have swept gas away from the black - hole vicinity and hence , may be responsible for the present quiescent state of sgra*. also of note is the fact that its peculiar metal abundances , along with the unusual combined radio and x - ray morphologies classifies this remnant as a metal - rich `` mixed - morphology '' ( mm ) snr .",
    "although , the properties of sgra east may be explained ( maeda et al .",
    "2001 ) by a low - mass type ii supernova , it is tempting here to speculate that this class of mm snrs may be the smoking gun for a black - hole induced white - dwarf explosion ( cf .",
    "khokhlov & melia 1996 ) .",
    "obviously , a clear picture of how to classify these events will require fully relativistic numerical computations in three spatial dimensions of the compression and thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in the background field of a black hole .",
    "efforts along this line are currently under way ( d. dearborn priv . comm . ) utilizing three dimensional hydrodynamics and radiation transport .",
    "as noted above , preliminary results indicate a central thermonuclear ignition ( very close to our adopted ignition density ) which proceeds to detonate the star . in future work",
    "we will simulate the radiation transport , light curve , and supernova remnant .",
    "we have explored a new class of type - i supernovae whereby the onset of a thermonuclear explosion is induced by relativistic enhancements of the white - dwarf self gravity as it accelerates in the background gravitational field of a black hole .",
    "we find that a potentially observable rate of such events could be occurring out to cosmological distances , particularly in the dense regions of galactic cores and possibly globular clusters as well .",
    "these explosions and their remnants could thus be characterized by their association with supermassive black holes galactic cores or massive black holes in globular clusters .",
    "they also might be characterized by an associated x - ray burst and/or a significantly modified light curve from matter colliding with the black - hole accretion disk .",
