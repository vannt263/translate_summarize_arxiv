    "the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts models @xcite can be equivalently formulated in terms of fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) clusters of like spins @xcite .",
    "these fk clusters are obtained from the geometrical spin clusters , which consist of nearest neighbor sites with their spin variables in the same state , by laying bonds with a certain probability between the nearest neighbors .",
    "the resulting fk , or bond clusters are in general smaller than the geometrical ones and also more loosely connected .",
    "the fk formulation of the potts models can be thought of as a generalization of ( uncorrelated ) bond percolation , which obtains in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the geometrical clusters themselves arise in the low - temperature representation of the pure model @xcite .    for @xmath4 , where the model undergoes a continuous phase transition ,",
    "the fk clusters percolate at the critical temperature and their fractal structure encodes the complete critical behavior .",
    "the thermal critical exponents are obtained using the cluster definitions from percolation theory @xcite . with clusters and their fractal properties taking the central stage , the fk formulation provides a geometrical description of the potts model .",
    "the concept of correlated bond percolation has been turned into a powerful monte carlo algorithm by swendsen and wang @xcite , and by wolff @xcite , in which not individual spins are updated , but entire fk clusters .",
    "the main advantage of the nonlocal cluster update over a local spin update , like metropolis or heat bath , is that it drastically reduces the critical slowing down near the critical point .",
    "although it was known from the relation with other statistical models that the phase transition of the potts models changes from being continuous to first order at @xmath5 @xcite , initial renormalization group approaches failed to uncover the first - order nature for larger @xmath0 . only after the pure model was extended to include vacant sites ,",
    "this feature was observed @xcite . in a kadanoff block - spin transformation ,",
    "the vacant sites represent blocks without a majority of spins in a certain state , i.e. , they represent disordered blocks .",
    "in addition to the pure potts critical behavior , the site diluted model also displays tricritical behavior , which was found to be intimately connected with the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 , the critical and tricritical fixed points move together until at @xmath5 they coalesce and the continuous phase transition turns into a first - order one .",
    "recently , the cluster boundaries of two - dimensional critical systems have been intensively studied by means of a method dubbed `` stochastic loewner evolution '' ( sle@xmath6)a one - parameter family of random conformal maps , introduced by schramm @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the brownian motion of a random walker is described by loewner s ordinary differential equation , containing a random term whose strength is specified by a parameter @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "different values of @xmath8 define different universality classes .",
    "various results previously conjectured on the basis of the coulomb gas map @xcite and conformal invariance @xcite have been rigorously established by this method .",
    "the interrelation between sle@xmath6 traces and the coulomb gas description is made explicit by observing that the coulomb gas coupling parameter @xmath9 can be simply expressed by @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the sle@xmath6 traces changes with @xmath8 : for @xmath11 the path is simple ( non - intersecting ) , while for @xmath12 it possesses double points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] ) ; and for @xmath13 it is space - filling @xcite .    , width=113 ]    this change reflects a change in the critical systems described by the sle@xmath6 traces @xcite : for @xmath14 they represent the hulls of fk clusters of the @xmath0-state potts model with @xmath15 , while for @xmath16 they represent the closed graphs of the high - temperature representation of the o(@xmath17 ) model with @xmath18 and at the same time also the external perimeters of fk clusters with dual parameter @xmath19 @xcite . for a recent overview from the mathematical point of view , see ref .",

    "in this paper , the tricritical regime of the two - dimensional ( annealed ) site diluted @xmath0-state potts model with @xmath20 is studied from the geometrical point of view .",
    "it will be argued that the tricritical behavior of these models is encoded in the geometrical clusters of the pure potts model in the same way that the critical behavior is encoded in the fk clusters .",
    "the relation between geometrical clusters and tricritical behavior was first established by stella and vanderzande @xcite for the special case @xmath2 , i.e. , for the ising model .",
    "using arguments based on renormalization group , conformal invariance , and numerical simulations , they showed that the geometrical cluster dimensions of the ising model at criticality are determined by the @xmath21 tricritical potts model , as was earlier conjectured by temesvri and hernyi @xcite .",
    "the values of two of the three leading tricritical exponents characterizing the geometrical clusters were already determined before by coniglio and klein @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of the @xmath21 tricritical model is that it is in the same universality class as the ising model defined by the central charge @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , it has the same correlation length exponent @xmath23 as the ising model .",
    "the boundaries of geometrical potts clusters were also already known to be in the same universality class as the tricritical model with the same central charge @xcite . formulated in terms of sle@xmath6 traces ,",
    "the hulls of geometrical clusters are described at criticality by traces with @xmath24 , thereby forming the geometrical counterpart of the fk hulls which are described by the traces with @xmath25 .",
    "it will be shown here that not just the boundary dimensions , but all the relevant fractal dimensions characterizing fk clusters are in one - to - one correspondence with those of the geometrical clusters , thus providing a physical picture for the close connection between the critical and tricritical behaviors just mentioned .",
    "the important aspect of the map is that it leaves the central charge unchanged , so that both cluster types and their boundaries are in the same universality class , characterized by the same central charge .    to support this geometrical picture ,",
    "we carry out a monte carlo study of the high - temperature representation of the 2-state potts , or ising model .",
    "we generate the high - temperature graphs by using a metropolis update algorithm involving single plaquettes @xcite . by duality ,",
    "the high - temperature graphs , which are closed , form the hulls of geometrical spin clusters on the dual lattice .",
    "we thus simulate the geometrical hulls directly without first considering the clusters . from the geometrical properties of these graphs , such as their distribution ,",
    "the size of the largest graph , and whether or not a graph spans the lattice , the fractal dimension of the hulls of geometrical clusters can be determined immediately .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the diluted potts model can be defined by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the inverse temperature and the double sum @xmath28 extends over nearest neighbors only . the first term at the right hand with coupling constant @xmath29 is the pure @xmath0-state potts model with spin variable @xmath30 at the @xmath31th site .",
    "on this a second potts model with auxiliary spin variable @xmath32 , coupling constant @xmath33 , and ghost field @xmath34 is superimposed .",
    "the reasons for this extension of the pure potts model are twofold .",
    "first , in the limit @xmath35 , the @xmath36-state potts model describes ( bond ) percolation @xcite , which is naturally formulated in terms of clusters .",
    "the extension thus allows for the investigation of cluster properties of the original model when the limit @xmath35 is taken .",
    "second , the diluted model has two fixed points for @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to the pure potts critical point , it also has a tricritical point , depending on the value of the coupling constant @xmath33 . adding vacancies",
    "therefore leads to two distinct scaling regimes , each with its own critical exponents .",
    "note that the limit @xmath38 is subtle as precisely for @xmath39 , the hamiltonian ( [ delpotts ] ) is independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that it reduces to the standard potts model .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ delpotts ] ) connects nearest neighbors of like spins ( for which @xmath40 ) with bond probability @xmath41 while the ghost field @xmath34 in the last term acts as a chemical potential for the auxiliary spins in the first state , @xmath42 .",
    "a configuration of auxiliary bonds thus obtained can be represented by a graph on a restricted lattice , consisting of those sites of the original lattice that have at least one nearest neighbor with like spins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bond ] ) .    ) indicated by different grey scales . _ right panel _ : reduced lattice consisting of sites having at least one nearest neighbor with like spin , i.e. , of the same shading .",
    "auxiliary bonds , taking two different values ( @xmath43 ) , are laid with a certain probability within clusters of like spins .",
    "the resulting bond clusters represent sites which are all in the same spin ( indicated by dots with the same shading ) and auxiliary spin state ( indicated by bonds with the same shading ) .",
    "the broken bonds within a spin cluster are indicated by broken lines .",
    "[ fig : bond],width=340 ]    following fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite , we can rewrite the partition function of the model ( [ delpotts ] ) as @xcite @xmath44   \\sum_{\\{\\gamma\\ } }    p^b ( 1-p)^{\\bar{b } } \\prod_{\\mathcal{c}(\\gamma ) } \\left[1 + ( s-1 ) { \\rm e}^{-h    n_c } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the set of bond configurations specified by @xmath46 bonds and @xmath47 broken bonds between like spins , while @xmath48 denotes the clusters in a given bond configuration @xmath49 .",
    "finally , @xmath50 is the number of sites contained in the @xmath51th cluster , where an isolated single site counts as a cluster , irrespective of whether it is on the restricted or the original lattice .",

    "as mentioned above , cluster properties can be extracted from the partition function ( [ zmurata ] ) of the diluted model by taking the limit @xmath35 .",

    "<S> the tricritical behavior of the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts model with vacancies for @xmath1 is argued to be encoded in the fractal structure of the geometrical spin clusters of the pure model . the known close connection between the critical properties of the pure model and the tricritical properties of the diluted model is shown to be reflected in an intimate relation between fortuin - kasteleyn and geometrical clusters : the same transformation mapping the two critical regimes onto each other also maps the two cluster types onto each other . </S>",
    "<S> the map conserves the central charge , so that both cluster types are in the same universality class . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical picture is supported by a monte carlo simulation of the high - temperature representation of the ising model ( @xmath2 ) in which closed graph configurations are generated by means of a metropolis update algorithm involving single plaquettes . </S>"
