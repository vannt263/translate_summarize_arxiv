    "the increasing availability of large scale computer facilities is allowing to study ever more complicated systems , with greater detail as well as longer length and time scales . despite this progress",
    ", the accurate evaluation of electrostatic interactions remains the most important bottleneck in molecular simulations of charged systems.@xcite    this uncomfortable situation is reflected in the number of different alternatives which are available in the literature in order to deal with coulombic interactions.@xcite yet , it is clear that the benchmark for both efficiency and accuracy of all studies remain the ewald summation technique.@xcite    in this method , the full electrostatic energy of the system is split into a real space contribution , which amounts to a pairwise summation of an effective damped coulomb potential , and a fourier contribution , which embodies the long range effects of the coulomb interactions .",
    "the latter term features a fourier transform of the charge distribution , which on the one hand , brings some conceptual difficulties,@xcite and on the other , is very time consuming to calculate.@xcite    in the last decade , a number of studies have been devoted to study more or less efficient methodologies that allow to calculate electrostatic interactions while avoiding the cumbersome fourier contributions of the ewald sum.@xcite such techniques , named recently under the provocative name of _ pairwise alternatives _ to the ewald sum , have recently received considerable popularity , but also some degree of controversy as regards efficiency,@xcite and accuracy.@xcite    the fact is that a pairwise alternative to the ewald summation has been available ever since the first few simulations of coulombic systems.@xcite indeed , the reaction field method is almost as old as computer simulations of charged systems,@xcite yet , it has a clear theoretical background which more recent approaches lack completely.@xcite despite this situation , the reaction field method seems to have been largely abandoned in favor of other techniques , with some exceptions.@xcite    recently , fukuda et al .",
    "proposed a heuristic approach to approximate the coulomb sum .",
    "this approach shares advantages of some of the pairwise methods , in the sense that it screens the coulomb interactions with a fast decaying function , but has a somewhat more elaborate electrostatic background.@xcite indeed , it has been recently recognized that this approach may be considered as a generalization of the reaction field method to screened potentials.@xcite    in this work we attempt to provide a sound theoretical background for a generalized reaction field method that achieves fast convergence of the coulomb sum as with several of the most popular pairwise alternatives.@xcite the theoretical calculations are supplemented with numerical results for test systems , which demonstrate the superiority of reaction field methods . additionally , we perform detailed analysis of the coulomb sum convergence error for either reaction field and ewald methods .",
    "this will allow us to identify the region of convergence parameters where each method is advantageous .",
    "in most simulations of charged systems , the influence of long range electrostatic interactions is estimated by assuming the finite sample is surrounded by an infinite number of replicas .",
    "the energy felt by , say , charge @xmath0 , may be then estimated as a lattice sum over the replicas : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes a translation of the unit cell vector , @xmath3 is the charge on particle @xmath0 , and @xmath4 is the position of @xmath5 relative to @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it is understood that the first sum runs over all possible unit cell translations , while the second sum runs over all charges inside the unit box .",
    "a prime reminds that @xmath5 must be different from @xmath0 when @xmath6 .",
    "this trick only gets rid of the boundary problem , but not of the actual calculation of @xmath7 , since the series is known to be conditionally convergent , with a very slow convergence in the favorable cases .",
    "a particularly inconvenient case is a summation over spherical shells , which is often not convergent.@xcite    in the classical treatment of ewald , the conditionally convergent lattice sum of charges is transformed into two rapidly convergent series , such that : @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 are vectors in fourier space and @xmath12 is the fourier transform of the charge density .",
    "additionally , the ewald sum may contain a surface term , @xmath13 , which accounts for the boundary conditions of the system .",
    "such term arises strictly from the long range electrostatic interactions with the boundary and surrounding medium , and is therefore essentially a fourier contribution corresponding to the missing @xmath14 term of the reciprocal space sum.@xcite in practice , for bulk systems under metallic boundary conditions the surface term may be neglected , so that we will henceforth drop this complication .",
    "the inverse length , @xmath15 , plays a key role , dictating the convergence of the series .",
    "a large value of @xmath15 leads to a rapidly convergent real space series that can be actually truncated already at @xmath16 , but then the @xmath17 contributions converges slowly .",
    "alternatively , a small value of @xmath15 produces a very fast convergence of @xmath17 , but then @xmath18 is slowly convergent .    an important observation made by wolf et al .",
    "is that for moderately small values of @xmath15 , most of the fourier contribution is actually given by the simple self term , @xmath19 so that the expensive reciprocal space summation may be ignored altogether.@xcite    this observation has allowed for the recent development of efficient methodologies for the calculation of electrostatic interactions.@xcite      having circumvented the problem of calculating the expensive reciprocal space sum , there still remains a crucial issue : how fast is the convergence of @xmath18 in those cases where the reciprocal space summation may be ignored ?    for most practical purposes , @xmath20 decays so fast that the lattice summation required for the evaluation of @xmath21 may be ignored .",
    "rather , a plain spherical cutoff is usually employed for distances larger than a cutoff radius , @xmath22 , with the hope that terms of order @xmath23 or smaller may be neglected .",
    "however , it remains desirable to have a cutoff as small as possible .",
    "for this purpose , one may try to exploit the techniques of continuum electro ",
    "dynamics for the @xmath24 potential in the same spirit as it has been successfully done for the plain coulomb potential.@xcite this would allow to truncate @xmath21 at cutoffs where @xmath20 is actually not negligible.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the following section , we will test the ability of different real  space lattice summations as a means to approximate the full electrostatic sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : infsum ] ) . whereas such methods are expected to provide a good convergence for dense fluids of dipolar molecules,@xcite we have chosen to study crystalline and molten ionic salts .",
    "this should provide a more stringent test than merely polar fluids and therefore allow us to obtain conclusions of more general validity .    as a test of an ordered ionic",
    "solid , we will consider crystalline sodium chloride .",
    "accordingly , we will assume an ordered arrangement of + and - unit charges with lattice spacing @xmath25 , as in the crystal rock salt lattice .",
    "for an ionic molten compound , we again consider configurations of + and - unit charges thermally sampled from a screened yukawa fluid with hard sphere diameter @xmath26 .",
    "the convergence of the average coulomb energy felt by an ion is monitored by calculating : @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairwisef])-[eq : selfg ] , and the corresponding choice of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as indicated in table [ tab : pairpot ] for different approximate schemes .      in order to make",
    "a transparent comparison between drf and wolf s charge neutralization schemes , let us first consider the case of zero damping , @xmath32 so that @xmath33 adopts the bare coulomb form @xmath34 .",
    "in this case , wolf s charge neutralization scheme becomes a mere shifted coulomb potential , while drf becomes the reaction field method .",
    "figures [ evsrc_nacl_alpha0 ] and [ evsrc_fundido_alpha0 ] show @xmath35 as estimated by bare coulomb summation , wolf s method and drf for solid nacl and the 1:1 molten salt .    as expected , in the nacl lattice ( fig .",
    "[ evsrc_nacl_alpha0 ] ) , the direct summation is not convergent , and the data is so scattered that it is not even possible to guess approximately the exact energy .",
    "the introduction of the neutralizing shell proposed by the wolf s method leads the energy to converge , and the amplitude of the oscillations decreases remarkably , even though the damping parameter is zero . however , if the drf method is used instead , the amplitude of the oscillations decreases much more , to the point that they are hardly visible in the scale of the figure ( at least beyond @xmath36 ) .",
    "we have checked that this behavior also occurs for other crystalline structures , such as blende and cscl .",
    "+ the improved performance of charge neutralization schemes is also seen in the case of a molten ionic compound ( fig .",
    "[ evsrc_fundido_alpha0 ] ) .",
    "the only difference here is that the direct summation does converge , since , due to the lack of long - range order , the charges are effectively shielded .",
    "the convergence is , however , very slow .",
    "again , the wolf s and drf methods accelerate significantly the convergence , and drf gives rise to somewhat smaller oscillations than wolf s method",
    ".      the convergence of @xmath35 may be much improved by using a damping function @xmath37 . as noted above",
    ", choosing @xmath32 transforms @xmath38 into the bare coulomb potential . for finite @xmath15",
    ", @xmath38 becomes a damped coulomb potential with a decay rate that is governed by @xmath15 .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that once @xmath39 , then immediately the fourier contribution to the coulomb sum becomes finite , so that even in the limit @xmath40 , the sum @xmath41 is only an approximation for the full coulomb sum .    as noted by wolf",
    ", however , there is a wide choice of finite @xmath15 where the only significant contribution to the fourier sum , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) , is the self term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfew ] ) . for the nacl crystal , for example ,",
    "choosing @xmath42 the reciprocal space sum is @xmath43 times smaller than the self term .",
    "the case of nacl is however a particularly favorable one , and might not be always taken for granted . for another simple crystal structure such as cscl , for example",
    ", the reciprocal space sum is now only @xmath44 times smaller than the self term .",
    "a study of the structure factors reveals that cscl is a very unfavorable case because here @xmath12 vanishes only once every two @xmath11 vectors , while nacl is probably particularly favorable , since @xmath12 vanishes for all but about n+1 every @xmath45 @xmath11 vectors .    for a fluid",
    ", the relative contribution of the sum can not generally be determined , but one here expects that @xmath12 is of finite range , and should therefore decay faster than for the case of cscl .",
    "be as it may , one expects there to be a range of sufficiently small @xmath15 , where , on the one hand , the fourier contribution is given essentially by the self term , while simultaneously , the convergence of the real sum is much improved .",
    "one then hopes that the reciprocal space sum can be ignored altogether , leaving all of the energy contribution in terms of a _",
    "relatively _ fast decaying damped coulomb potential .",
    "we test this hypothesis first for a perfect nacl crystal , then for the 1:1 molten salt .",
    "figures [ evsrc_nacl_alpha1.0 ] and [ evsrc_nacl_alpha2.0 ] show the evolution of the real part of the energy of the nacl crystal with the cut - off radius for finite @xmath15 ( 1.0  @xmath46 and 2.0  @xmath46 respectively ) .",
    "results are displayed for the real space ewald summation ( rse ) , wolf s method ( wm ) , wolf - fennell - gezelter s method ( wfg ) and drf .",
    "notice that for finite @xmath15 , even the real part of the ewald summation is convergent .",
    "however , the oscillations are rather large and exhibit discontinuities , while the convergence remains relatively slow .",
    "the use of wolf s method makes the oscillations decrease strongly .",
    "the drf method shows a clear diminution of the oscillations of the energy , not only compared with rse , but also with wolf s method , while the performance of wfg is about the same as that afforded by drf . further increasing @xmath15 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 produces a spectacular improvement on the convergence of @xmath35 .",
    "this is obvious right away by comparing both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 scales of figures [ evsrc_nacl_alpha1.0 ] and [ evsrc_nacl_alpha2.0 ] .",
    "i.e. , not only the asymptotic value of @xmath35 is reached much faster , but also the amplitude of the oscillations is decreased by more than an order of magnitude . obviously , this is at the expense of making the fourier contribution larger , and more importantly , increasing the relevance of the reciprocal space sum .",
    "in fact , for @xmath51 the reciprocal space sum is now already about @xmath52 times the self term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfew ] ) , so that it becomes unsafe to approximate the coulomb sum without taking account of the full fourier contribution .    an interesting feature of both wfg and drf is that , not only is the amplitude of the oscillations smaller , but also the discontinuities that were apparent in rse and to a smaller extent in wm seem to be considerably smoothed .",
    "this smoothing property must be related to the presence of a shifted force contribution to the effective pair potential , since only wfg and drf share this feature among the four methods tested .",
    "in fact , wfg and drf perform similarly , so that it would seem it is the the shifted force contribution what makes these methods perform better than rse and wm .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to mention the significance of the self term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfg ] ) . indeed , at first thought one might consider that a constant contribution @xmath53 merely shifts the total energy , but not the underlying dynamics so that it may be completely ignored .",
    "however , in order to compare the results of @xmath7 for different methods it is essential to account for the appropriate self contribution as indicated in table [ tab : pairpot ] . actually , even for a given method , results with different @xmath22 ( or @xmath15 )",
    "can only be compared when @xmath53 is included .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the case of wfg , which does not include a self term in the original reference , and could only be compared with the rse , wm and drf by including the self term of tab.[tab : pairpot ] .",
    "this can also be of great importance in the simulation of open systems , as is the case of studies performed in the grand canonical ensemble .    as a final remark ,",
    "we note the conclusions drawn from the analysis performed on nacl also hold for other simple crystal structures such as cscl and zns ( not shown ) .",
    "let us now compare the performance of the pairwise summation schemes for the 1:1 molten salt .",
    "depicted in figures [ evsrc_fundido_alpha0.4 ] and [ evsrc_fundido_alpha1.0 ] is the behavior of @xmath35 now calculated for a molten ionic compound . in a molten system ,",
    "the oscillations of the energy are smoother than in a crystal , irrespective of the method used .",
    "since the system is disordered , the interaction with new ions as the cut - off radius increases does not take place at discrete distances , but rather , continuously .",
    "+ nevertheless , the oscillations given by rse are still too high , and the alternative pairwise schemes clearly improve this situation . in the figures , it is clear that wolf s method already diminishes widely the oscillations , and drf makes this improvement somewhat more significant . + on the contrary , the wfg method now seems to converge slower , and more importantly , does not seem to oscillate but rather approach the asymptotic energy from below .      in the preceding sections we have studied the convergence of the energy .",
    "another important issue refers to the convergence of the forces .",
    "since , however , the net force exerted on an ion in a perfect crystal is zero , we rather consider the virial per ion , which has similar convergence issues as the energy .",
    "accordingly , we study the convergence of a virial function , defined as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 while the forces are given by differentiation of the corresponding pairwise potentials ( c.f .",
    "tab.[tab : pairpot ] ) .",
    "figure [ virialvsrc_nacl_alpha1.0 ] shows the evolution of the virial of an ion inside de nacl lattice with the cut - off radius for a fixed value of @xmath56 .",
    "results are shown for rse , wfg , and drf .",
    "notice that we do not employ wolf s method here , as it gives a discontinuity in the force at @xmath22 .",
    "the figure explicitly shows a rather poor convergence of the rse , which exhibits strong oscillations and discontinuities as a function of @xmath22 . at this point",
    ", it is worth mentioning that for @xmath32 , the rse method becomes the bare coulomb sum and does also not converge at all ( not shown ) . using the effective pairwise schemes",
    "very much improves this situation .",
    "indeed , the amplitude and also the frequency of the oscillations is reduced , while the convergence is also achieved faster .",
    "apparently , wfg and drf perform similarly , lending support to the idea that a shifted force is necessary ( and perhaps sufficient ) to improve the convergence of the sum .",
    "this is somewhat confusing , given that one can hardly attribute any electrostatic significance to the wfg scheme , which merely corresponds to a force shifted potential .",
    "figure [ virialtotalvsrc_fundido_alpha0.4 ] displays results for @xmath57 in the molten salt system , with @xmath58 . in this case , the direct rse summation displays deviations of about the same amplitude than wfg and drf , but clearly exhibits stronger discontinuities . again both wfg and drf perform similarly .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown analysis similar to those of ref . , which indicate that for sufficiently small @xmath15 , one can devise effective pairwise potentials that allow to approximate the coulomb sum , eq .",
    "( [ eq : infsum ] ) , at low computational cost . furthermore",
    ", we have shown that the damped reaction field method converges at least as good as wm and wfg methods , but has a sounder physical interpretation .",
    "however , our theoretical analysis reveals that drf , as well as wm and wfg , are in fact plausible approximations for the real space ewald sum , eq .",
    "( [ eq : erfcsum ] ) , whether one opts to neglect the reciprocal space sum ( eq .  ( [ eq : fourier ] ) ) or not .",
    "this is a very relevant issue which has apparently not been considered previously .",
    "it suggest one could perform the full ewald summation , accounting both for the real space and fourier contributions ( whether in the standard implementation or in the particle mesh approaches ) , but using drf in order to accelerate the convergence of the real space term .",
    "this would allow to perform the coulomb sum with arbitrary precision , but decreasing the cost of the real space sum .    in order to study this question in more depth",
    ", we introduce a measure of the truncation error performed in the real space sum as follows : @xmath59    a plot of the real space convergence error is shown in fig.[erorres_partereal_nacl ] for the case of crystalline nacl .",
    "full lines indicate the error that results when eq .",
    "( [ eq : erfcsum ] ) is evaluated by sum of plain @xmath24 contributions , i.e. , rse , and dashed lines the case where it is evaluated using drf .",
    "the figure clearly shows that , for reasonable choices of @xmath22 , there is a range of small @xmath15 , where drf exhibits much smaller convergence error than rse .",
    "however , as @xmath15 increases , the difference becomes smaller , and actually exhibits a crossover to a regime where the plain rse seems to perform better .    at any rate , the convergence",
    "is always improved for large values of @xmath15 .",
    "however , one can not increase @xmath15 arbitrarily , because then the fourier contribution would become relevant . in order to optimize the choice of @xmath15 for a given fixed @xmath22 ,",
    "the relevant issue is then what the error of neglecting the fourier sum is .    in order to asses",
    "this , we now introduce a measure of the truncation error performed in the reciprocal space sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) .",
    "this error results from the neglect of contributions with reciprocal space vectors @xmath60 larger than a prescribed cutoff , @xmath61 .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rerror ] ) , we can therefore introduce a fourier space truncation error as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 defines a cubic cutoff for vectors whose integer components ( absolute value ) are larger than @xmath63 .",
    "obviously , the pairwise effective potentials as estimated in wm and wfg , as well as in the zero dipole method of ref.@xcite , neglect the fourier space contribution all together .",
    "this corresponds to assuming a fourier space convergence error for zero cutoff , @xmath64 .",
    "fig.[erorres_partereal_nacl ] displays together with @xmath65 the fourier space convergence error @xmath66 for the special case where @xmath64 .",
    "clearly , it is always possible to choose a value of @xmath15 sufficiently small that @xmath67 is negligible .",
    "however , the optimal choice of @xmath15 is one where both @xmath68 and @xmath66 are of similar order .",
    "obviously , it does not make much sense to achieve an exceptional convergence in the real space contribution , if this is at the cost of having a much larger reciprocal space error , because what matters is the overall convergence of the full coulomb sum .",
    "unfortunately , fig.[erorres_partereal_nacl ] seems to suggest that @xmath69 cuts @xmath65 at a point where there is no significant advantage of the drf method over the plain rse summation .",
    "i.e. , the point at which @xmath67 is about the same order of magnitude of @xmath65 occurs where drf and rse perform similarly .",
    "this seems clearly visible , at least for the perfect nacl crystal and three choices of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the same conclusions may be drawn from fig.[erorres_partereal_fundido ] , which plots the convergence errors for the case of the molten salt . here",
    ", the situation seems to be even less advantageous for drf , since the region of @xmath15 where it exhibits smaller error than the plain rse is smaller .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath67 cuts the curves @xmath65 after the crossover where rse converges better than drf , for all but the smallest @xmath22 studied .",
    "we now study the optimization of the ewald sum by relaxing the constraint of pairwise schemes , i.e. , by allowing for a finite reciprocal space cutoff .",
    "this is still a relevant issue , since the ewald sum requires to share the computational cost between both the real and fourier contributions.@xcite an improvement in the convergence of the real space summation would allow to shift some of the cost of the reciprocal space sum to the real space term , making the former less expensive .",
    "fig.[erorres_parterealyreciproca_nacl]-[erorres_parterealyreciproca_fundido ] display @xmath65 as estimated from rse and drf , compared with @xmath66 for crystalline and molten nacl , respectively .",
    "notice that the errors are shown in logarithmic scale , with large negative values indicating small errors .    from inspection of @xmath65 ,",
    "it now becomes clear that one can identify two different regimes .",
    "firstly , a _ reaction field regime _ corresponding to small values of the product @xmath72 , where drf produces smaller real space errors than the plain ewald real space sum . secondly , an _ ewald regime _ , of large @xmath72 , where it is actually the rse summation which performs better than drf , and presumably , better than whichever pairwise effective potential scheme .",
    "optimization of the ewald sum requires to choose @xmath22 , @xmath15 and @xmath63 such that @xmath73 .",
    "thus , a mixed scheme using drf and reciprocal space sums would be advantageous over the ewald method if the condition above is met at a value of @xmath15 where the convergence error of drf is smaller than that of rse .",
    "unfortunately , our plots seem to indicate that this is not usually the case . only for the special choice of @xmath64 ,",
    "i.e. , for complete neglect of the reciprocal space sum , we find that an optimized drf yields errors similar to the optimized rse .",
    "notice that the conclusions drawn above are restricted to bulk systems .",
    "additional care must be taken for inhomogeneous systems , where the charge distribution may exhibit large or even diverging correlations of long wavelength .",
    "the charge structure factor @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) then becomes very large for small @xmath75 , and the reciprocal space sum is significant even for small @xmath15 .",
    "empirically , this has been observed by takahashi et al . , who studied the liquid - vapor interface of spce / e water and noticed the convergence of wolf s method could only be achieved for cutoffs as large as 20 molecular diameters.@xcite such a poor convergence indicates very long range , small wave - vector interactions across the interface .",
    "these are best dealt by transferring some of the real space computational burden to the reciprocal space sum , which precisely is devised to ensure fast convergence of small wave - vector contributions .",
    "theoretically , it has been shown that properly taking into account a large scale inhomogeneity requires to account for the net dipole moment of the system in the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "such contribution , which is significant and independent of the choice of @xmath15 , corresponds to a zero wave - vector term of the reciprocal space sum and can not possibly be accounted for with a real space finite cutoff.@xcite",
    "in this work we have considered a number of recent methodologies which allow to approximate the electrostatic energy of charged systems by means of effective pairwise potentials.@xcite    our theoretical study reveals that these methods may be actually considered as approximations to the real space ewald sum only , eq .",
    "( [ eq : erfcsum ] ) , rather than to the sought coulomb sum , eq .",
    "( [ eq : infsum ] ) .",
    "this is an important matter , because it means that the pairwise effective potentials can not possibly account for the long range electrostatic response of charged systems .",
    "particularly , such methods can not account ab - initio for the surface term of the coulomb energy , which is recovered in the full ewald sum as the @xmath14 limit to the reciprocal space term.@xcite    for cases where the damping parameter @xmath15 is small enough , however , all terms besides the @xmath14 contribution to the reciprocal space sum are negligible and the ewald self term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfew ] ) is then a very good approximation for the fourier space contribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) .    in such cases",
    ", our numerical study shows that pairwise effective potentials produce indeed a better convergence of the real space ewald sum than the ewald pair potential itself . in practice , this may be achieved by introducing a shifted,@xcite or a shifted force,@xcite potential .",
    "however , our theoretical analysis shows that the correct electrostatic treatment may achieve both the potential and force shift by means of a generalization of the reaction field method,@xcite which damps the coulomb potential via an @xmath20 function .",
    "this damped reaction field method , used as an approximation to the real space ewald sum smoothly transforms from a pure reaction field to an effective ewald sum , by tuning the damping parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we have studied the performance of the modified coulomb sums in a particularly difficult case of an ionic crystal and its melt .",
    "this provides a stringent test of all methods and thus allows to draw more general conclusions .",
    "our results show that the new damped reaction field method , which has a much more clear electrostatic significance , is also the method which provides better convergence of the energy and the virial for both the crystal and the melt .",
    "a close inspection of the convergence errors allows to identify two different regimes .",
    "firstly , a reaction field regime , corresponds to small @xmath72 , where effective pair wise methods such as the damped reaction field method converge better than the bare @xmath24 potential .",
    "secondly , an ewald regime , corresponding to large @xmath72 , where the bare ewald potential actually converges better than all effective pair wise methods studied .",
    "our numerical study shows that the crossover from the reaction field to the ewald regime occurs precisely for those values of @xmath15 where the reciprocal space sum has an error about the same size as the real space sum .",
    "since this equality is the condition for optimization of the coulomb sum,@xcite",
    "the implication is that for an optimized calculation of the electrostatic energy the ewald sum method is not improved by effective pair wise methods .",
    "such methods do remain useful and produce improved convergence of the ewald sum in those cases where high accuracy calculations , or optimization of the coulomb sum are not a concern .",
    "alternatively , they might also be competitive in cases where the availability of parallel computing does not make competitive the calculation of the reciprocal space sum .",

    "<S> in this paper we study a general theoretical framework which allows to approximate the real space ewald sum by means of effective force shifted screened potentials , together with a self term . using this strategy it is possible to generalize the reaction field method , as a means to approximate the real space ewald sum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this method exhibits faster convergence of the coulomb energy than several schemes proposed recently in the literature while enjoying a much more sound and clear electrostatic significance . in terms of the damping parameter of the screened potential </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to identify two clearly distinct regimes of convergence . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a reaction field regime corresponding to the limit of small screening , where effective pair potentials converge faster than the ewald sum . secondly , an ewald regime , where the plain real space ewald sum converges faster . tuning </S>",
    "<S> the screening parameter for optimal convergence occurs essentially at the crossover . </S>",
    "<S> the implication is that effective pair potentials are an alternative to the ewald sum only in those cases where optimization of the convergence error is not possible . </S>"
