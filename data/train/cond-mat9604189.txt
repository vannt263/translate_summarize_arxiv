    "since the original work of landau , @xcite the fermi liquid theory ( flt ) is one of the main basis of our understanding of interacting fermions . the discovery of new materials showing strong deviations with respect to flt , like high-@xmath8 superconductors , has revived interest in the microscopic derivation of landau s theory .",
    "in particular , this has motivated the application of rg methods to interacting fermions in dimension @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite    rg methods are well - known for one - dimensional interacting fermions .",
    "@xcite in these systems , the low - order perturbation theory is characterized by two logarithmically singular and interfering channels of correlation , namely , the particle - particle ( cooper ) and @xmath10 particle - hole ( peierls ) channels .",
    "this invalidates any rpa - like approach which implicitly assumes the independence of the channels to lowest order .",
    "the rg approach allows one to sum up the leading , next - to - leading ... logarithmic singularities in a consistent way .",
    "it has been also successfully applied to quasi - one - dimensional conductors ( i.e. weakly coupled chains systems ) where the interchain coupling can lead either to a fermi liquid behavior or to a state of broken symmetry .",
    "@xcite rg methods have also been used to study the instabilities of isotropic two - dimensional systems with respect to superconductivity or charge ( spin ) density wave . @xcite",
    "while the independence of various channels of correlation is in general expected to be a good approximation ( therefore allowing an rpa approach ) , for particular fermi surfaces the situation can become more complicated due to the presence of nesting , van hove singularities ... in such cases , the rg can be a useful tool to study the instabilities of the system and to investigate in detail phenomena like superconductivity induced by exchange of spin fluctuations .    in the above mentioned examples , one focuses on `` highly quantum '' degrees of freedom corresponding to energies larger than the temperature .",
    "the perturbation theory is characterized in general by logarithmic singularities of the type @xmath11 ( @xmath12 being an ultra - violet cut - off ) , which clearly shows that the temperature plays the role of an infrared cut - off .",
    "this should be contrasted with the standard diagrammatic derivation of flt@xcite ( which in the following is referred to as the microscopic flt ) where these `` quantum '' degrees of freedom are in general not considered explicitly but simply included in the definition of some regular low - energy effective interactions .",
    "flt concentrates on the landau ( or zero - sound ( zs ) ) channel ( particle - hole pairs at small total momentum and energy ) where the important degrees of freedom are known to be within the thermal broadening of the fermi surface .",
    "this latter property can be seen from the polarization diagram ( or particle - hole bubble ) which is proportional to @xmath13 to lowest order in perturbation theory ( @xmath14 is the fermi occupation factor ) .",
    "thus the role of temperature is to fix the typical energy scale rather than to provide an infrared cut - off .",
    "this makes the application of rg methods in that case somewhat different from the above mentioned cases .",
    "the first attempt to recover ( in detail ) landau s theory from a rg method is due to shankar .",
    "@xcite however , shankar s discussion of flt rather relies on usual perturbative theory than on rg approach .",
    "although rg arguments were used to identify the relevant couplings , the low - energy effective degrees of freedom were indeed explicitly integrated out by means of standard diagrammatic calculations . using a finite temperature formalism , chitov and snchal",
    "have shown how flt can be understood from a rg approach .",
    "in particular , they have correctly analyzed ( within the rg framework ) the singularities of the landau channel which are at the heart of the microscopic flt .",
    "chitov and snchal s analysis has recently been further developed and a detailed connection between the microscopic flt and the rg approach has emerged .",
    "@xcite    the aim of this paper is to show how flt results can be systematically derived in a rg approach . on the one hand we derive in detail the results reported in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , we present new results and discuss at length some particular points concerning the application of rg methods to interacting fermions . in the next section",
    ", we recall some aspects of flt .",

    ", we shall rather use @xmath55 than @xmath37 .",
    "the foundations of flt were rapidly established using field theoretical methods .",
    "@xcite the key microscopic quantity is the two - particle vertex function , which , together with the one - particle propagator @xmath56 , plays an essential role in the theory of the fermi liquid .",

    "it is therefore necessary in this case ( at least in principle ) to consider the zs and zs@xmath18 channels on the same footing and to add to the rhs of ( [ eqint1 ] ) the term @xmath81 where the second line is obtained in the limit @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( and @xmath84 ) .",

    "these discontinuities are suppressed if one includes in the action three - body interactions.@xcite    by iterating `` by hand '' the rg equations , one can identify the diagrams which are effectively considered via the rg approach .",
    "for instance , a one - loop rg calculation in the zs channel ( ignoring the zs@xmath18 and bcs channels ) amounts to suming the series of bubble diagrams in this channel . in the following",
    "we explicitly identify some of the diagrams generated by the rg equations to prove the importance of three - body interactions .",

    "the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath167 is then obtained from the equation : @xmath450 consider now the zs@xmath18 graph where the particle and the hole in the intermediate state have energies @xmath451 and @xmath452 with @xmath453 . in the ft approach , this graph contributes to the rg flow when @xmath454 .",
    "thus , as pointed out by shankar , @xcite @xmath455 is given by the sum of all graphs where one momentum is at the cut - off while the others are below . while the kw and ft approaches are clearly equivalent for the zs graph for @xmath456 ( since if one momentum of the particle - hole bubble is at the cut - off , then momentum conservation ensures that the other one is also at the cut - off ) , they in general differ .",
    "in the ft approach , it is clear that there is no need to consider three- , four- ... body interactions contrary to the kw approach .",
    "this also means that @xmath457 does not contain the same information in the kw and ft approaches .",
    "in particular , the low - energy effective action ( [ action ] ) ( defined for a given cut - off @xmath356 ) is not the same in both approaches . the two - body interaction @xmath140 is different and the action contains @xmath6-body interactions ( @xmath426 ) in the kw approach .",

    "an interesting aspect of the ft approach is that the frustration of the interference between channels appears very naturally since it always involves the small parameter @xmath458 because of phase space restriction.@xcite ( notice that the small parameter @xmath458 never appears in the kw approach . ) for instance , the contribution of the zs@xmath18 graph to the renormalization of @xmath16 is of order @xmath458 with respect to the one of the zs graph .",

    "processes involving both low and high - energy states are integrated out in the early stage of the renormalization procedure .",

    "no cut - off is imposed on the transfer momenta which are let free . in principle , it is necessary to impose an additional constraint on the transfer momenta in order to ensure that every degree of freedom is integrated once and only once ( at a given order ) . in practice",

    "as discussed at the end of sec.[sec : bol ] , the calculation of quantities involving @xmath508 with finite @xmath15 requires to consider on the same footing the renormalization of @xmath464 and @xmath467 . for simplicity , we assume that all quantities can be calculated with the fp form of the one - particle propagator , @xmath509 , ignoring any finite life - time as can be justified at low temperature .",
    "moreover , we do not take into account the effect of the rescaling of the fields , @xmath510 , on the rg equation of @xmath511 .",
    "these approximations are expected to be correct as long as one considers only small transfer momentum @xmath1 in the diagram for the self - energy ( fig .",
