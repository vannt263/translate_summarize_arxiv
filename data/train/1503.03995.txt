    "the simple rhombus design that we have presented in the main text for clarity of the discussion suffers from the fact that the charge configuration on the capacitors of the central islands in the rhombus is strongly susceptible to fluctuations of stray offset charges that couple capacitively to the islands .",
    "they can be modeled , e.g. , through voltage sources @xmath138 that charge capacitors @xmath139 coupled to the rhombus islands , yielding @xmath140 for the stray offset charge @xmath141 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : inductive_shunts ] .",
    "these stray offset charges are not controlled and fluctuate in general independently , destroying the symmetry of the rhombus arms and lifting the @xmath0-periodicity of the rhombus .",
    "as was argued theoretically  @xcite and tested experimentally  @xcite , this can be remedied by adding inductive shunts of strength @xmath142 to the lower parts of the rhombus arms . in the classical case and",
    "ignoring the josephson junctions , adding inductive shunts to the ground in the central islands of the rhombus reduces this susceptibility by a factor of @xmath143 , where @xmath109 is the frequency of offset charge fluctuations and @xmath144 is the plasma frequency of charge oscillations in the resulting lc resonator with the inductive energy @xmath145 . as was shown in ref .",
    ", this property carries over to the quantum case . as a consequence of the inductive shunts ,",
    "the rhombus does not couple any more directly to @xmath141 but only to @xmath146 .",
    "the associated noise power changes from the @xmath147 form typical for fluctuations of @xmath141 @xcite to a much more benign noise power proportional to @xmath109 .     that shunt the islands in the rhombus arms and reduce the susceptibility to stray offset charges coupling capacitively to the islands . modeling the offset charges through fluctuating voltage sources that charge capacitors",
    "@xmath139 coupled to the islands yields the relation @xmath148 for the stray offset charge @xmath149 .",
    "apart from the change in rhombus design , the proposed setup remains the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "importantly , it is sufficient to add inductive shunts only to the lower part of the rhombus arms such that no inductive coupling to the main island is generated . ]    as we have discussed above , the inclusion of inductive shunts reduces the sensitivity to offset charge fluctuations , but it should of course also preserve the behavior of the rhombus as an effective @xmath5 element .",
    "this means that in our setup , we can not make @xmath150 arbitrarily large since our treatment required that both the band indices and the bloch momenta @xmath151 associated with the translational symmetry in the variables @xmath152 in absence of inductive shunts remain good variables .",
    "this means that @xmath150 should be a weak perturbation with @xmath153 .",
    "we can therefore follow the ideas of refs .   and transform to a basis of bloch waves . solving the @xmath1-periodic part of the rhombus perturbatively in @xmath75 and projecting on the lowest band of the rhombus yields a hamiltonian of the form @xmath154 with periodic functions @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 with period @xmath158 .",
    "the absence of a coupling between @xmath159 and @xmath160 reflects the fact that the phases @xmath49 are not coupled by the rhombus hamiltonian .",
    "the presence of a coupling to @xmath5 [ @xmath161 that is even [ odd ] under the exchange @xmath162 reflects the symmetry under exchange of the rhombus arms and simultaneous advance of @xmath3 by @xmath0 that we discussed in the main text . the additional time - reversal symmetry at half a flux quantum forbids a coupling to @xmath163 or @xmath164 and requires that the functions @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 possess quadratic expansions around @xmath165 which we find to be of the form @xmath166",
    "obviously , for @xmath167 and @xmath168 , the hamiltonian @xmath169 reproduces the ground state energy @xmath73 that was given in the main text . for finite @xmath150 , the former rhombus eigenstates with sharp bloch momenta @xmath159 ,",
    "@xmath160 are replaced by eigenstates of the hamiltonian . assuming a symmetric state of the rhombus arms , the ground state energy @xmath170 of @xmath169 can still be expanded in the form @xmath171 .",
    "importantly , @xmath172 implies @xmath173 which guarantees that the term @xmath174 remains dominant in the expansion of @xmath170 .",
    "numerical checks show that this property persists beyond the perturbative regime in @xmath75 and remains valid also for @xmath103 .",
    "the inductive shunts thus manage to reduce the susceptibility to charge noise without spoiling the generation of an effective @xmath5 potential by the rhombus .",
    "finally , let us comment on the adiabatic decoupling of the island and the rhombus for finite @xmath150 .",
    "the level spacing of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian   is of the order of the plasma energy @xmath175 . in view of the adiabatic decoupling , it is desirable to have @xmath176 , i.e. , @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the energy scale of the rhombus .",
    "we note that for @xmath102 and @xmath179 , we have @xmath180 such that choosing @xmath181 and @xmath182 is easily possible . following ref .",
