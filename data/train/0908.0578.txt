    "coronal holes ( chs ) are dark and void areas on the sun if observed with x - ray ( underwood & muney 1967 ) and euv lines ( reeves & parkinson 1970 ) .",
    "they are low density and temperature regions compared with the quiet sun ( qs ) ( munro & withbroe 1972 ; harvey 1996 ; chiuderi drago et al .",
    "1999 ) . in chs , magnetic fields are dominated by one polarity and open magnetic lines are concentrated ( bohlin 1977 ) .",
    "these open magnetic lines extend to the interplanetary space along which plasma escapes , giving rise to fast solar wind ( krieger et al .",
    "1973 ; zirker 1977 ; wang et al . 1996 ; harvey & recely 2002 ; tu et al . 2005 ) . however , magnetic fields are not exclusively unipolar in chs and there also exist closed coronal loops besides the open flux ( eg .",
    "levine 1977 ; zhang et al .",
    "wiegelmann & solanki ( 2004 ) computed some properties of coronal loops in chs and the qs .",
    "they found that high and long closed loops in chs are extremely rare , whereas short and low - lying loops are almost as abundant as in the qs .",
    "fisk ( 2005 ) predicted that a ch is a region with a local minimum in the rate of emerging dipoles .",
    "this prediction was supported by zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , whose results reveal that the dipole emergence rate in the qs is 4.3 times as large as that in the ch .",
    "according to fisk & schwadron ( 2001 ) and fisk ( 2005 ) , dipoles can transport open flux on the solar surface through magnetic flux reconnection and result in the ch evolution by affecting magnetic field distribution and characters .",
    "magnetic flux cancellation is an observational phenomenon of magnetic flux disappearance in the encounter of two magnetic elements of opposite polarities ( martin et al .",
    "1985 ; livi et al .",
    "1985 ; zhang et al . 2001 ) .",
    "zwaan ( 1978 , 1987 ) illustrated three modes for removal of magnetic flux with different polarities from the photosphere : ( 1 ) if two poles are still connected by coronal loops , then the disappearance of the magnetic flux can be caused by retraction of flux loops to below the photosphere ; ( 2 ) when two poles with no initial connection encounter , magnetic reconnection , creating both @xmath3@xmath4shaped and u@xmath4shaped loops , is required to remove the magnetic flux from the photosphere .",
    "if reconnection occurs below the photosphere , the newly formed u@xmath4shaped loop is pulled out of the photosphere ; ( 3 ) if reconnection takes place above the photosphere , the @xmath3@xmath4shaped loop submerges ( retracts ) below the photosphere .",
    "magnetic reconnection may not be necessary for forming the emerging u@xmath4shaped loop if two poles connect below the photosphere ( parker 1984 ; lites et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "generally , dipoles appear to rise from below the solar surface , separate and dissipate ( wallenhorst & topka 1982 ; liggett & zirin 1983 ) .",
    "however , some dipoles do not decouple from subsurface fields ( zirin 1985 ) .",
    "an excellent example exhibiting the submergence of part of an active region was reported by rabin et al .",
    "another example displaying the submergence of entire region is the disappearance of a sunspot group , studied by zirin ( 1985 ) with videomagnetograms and h@xmath5 observations .    when collision occurs between opposite polarities , transverse fields and doppler velocities at the cancellation sites",
    "have been studied by many authors .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2009 ) found that transverse fields connecting cancelling magnetic elements are formed .",
    "harvey et al . ( 1999 ) estimated vertical velocity of magnetic flux descent ranging from about 0.3 to 1.0 km s@xmath2 , and yurchyshyn & wang ( 2001 ) observed an upflow of about 0.6 km s@xmath2 at a cancellation site .",
    "the first direct observational evidence of flux retraction in cancelling magnetic features was presented by chae et al .",
    "they found that the magnetic fields were nearly horizontal at the place where two opposite polarities cancelled each other .",
    "in addition , they observed significant magnetic flux submergence of about 1.0 km s@xmath2 near the polarity inversion line .",
    "recently , magnetic filed properties at the cancellation sites were investigated by kubo & shimizu ( 2007 ) based on more collision events .    due to the restriction of observations ,",
    "not all the properties of chs are well known , such as ch formation and decay .",
    "these ch properties are related to magnetic field structures and evolution , the key characters to understand most solar phenomena , so it is still important for us to investigate magnetic fields in chs with high spatial and temporal resolution data , especially the vector fields and other plentiful information from the hinode ( kosugi et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this work",
    ", we study the evolution process of two dipoles in an equatorial ch , using observations from the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ; domingo et al .",
    "1995 ) , the solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ; howard et al . 2008 ; kaiser et al . 2008 ) and the hinode .",

    "the conclusions and discussion are presented in sect .",
    "the ch shown in fig .",
    "1 was observed with the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ; scherrer et al .",
    "1995 ) and the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; delaboudinire et al .",
    "1995 ) on soho , the extreme ultra violet imager ( euvi ; howard et al .",
    "2008 ) , part of the sun - earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ; howard et al .",
    "2008 ) aboard stereo , combined with the spectro - polarimeter ( sp ; lites et al .",
    "2001 ) and the narrowband filter imager ( nfi ; kosugi et al .",
    "2007 ) , two components of the solar optical telescope ( sot ; ichimoto et al . 2008",
    "; shimizu et al . 2008 ; suematsu et al . 2008 ; tsuneta et al . 2008 ) on board hinode .",
    "we adopt the mdi , eit and euvi full - sun observations between 08:00 ut 02 march and 12:00 ut 07 march 2008 .",
    "the data sets used in this study are summarized in table 1 .",
    "mdi provides full - disk longitudinal magnetograms with pixel sampling of 1.97 .",
    "the cadence of mdi magnetograms was 1 minute during the periods of 11:35 ut ",
    "14:36 ut 02 march and 00:57 ut 03 march ",
    "12:00 ut 07 march , and 96 minutes during the other periods .",
    "eit observed the ch with a pixel size of 2.63 and a cadence of 12 minutes in fe xii 195  .",
    "stereo a and b simultaneously observed full - sun with a 1.59 pixel resolution and a 2.5-min cadence in fe ix 171  . on the early of 05 march 2008 , when the ch was located at disk center viewed from the earth ,",
    "the stereo a and b were 44@xmath6 ahead and 48@xmath6 behind the earth . in order to maintain the ch close to disk center in each image , we employ stereo b observations before 00:00 ut 05 march , and stereo a observations after that .",
    "hinode sp and nfi observed only part of the ch , but covered majority of our target during 03 march and 05 march , 2008 .",
    "the sp , which provides full stokes profiles ( i , q , u and v ) of fe 6301.5  ( @xmath7 ) and 6302.5  ( @xmath8 ) lines , scanned the target along east@xmath4west direction in the fast map mode with a step of 0.295 , and the pixel size along the slit is 0.32 .",
    "the nfi obtained the stokes i and v images at an offset wavelength of @xmath4172 m from the center of the na 5896  line with a cadence of 3 minutes and a pixel resolution of 0.16 .",
    "at first , all the images from the eit , euvi and nfi are prepared by applying the standard processing routines , including flat field correction , dark current and pedestal subtraction , cosmic ray removal , et al .. then we rotate the target in the mdi , eit and euvi images to the central meridian .",
    "after that we re - scale and uniform their pixel sizes . in order to remove the drift due to the correlation tracker motion ( shimizu et al .",
    "2008 ) , nfi v / i ( i.e. stokes v signals divided by stokes i signals obtained at the same time ) images are coaligned with each other by using the image cross - correlation method .",
    "then the mdi magnetograms were aligned to the nfi v / i images by cross - correlating specific features after being re - scaled .",
    "the same coalignment method is also applied to match the eit and euvi images .",
    "since the mdi and the closest eit images are from the same satellite and can be coalined easily , we think the mdi , eit , euvi and nfi images are coaligned well now .",
    "due to the high conductivity , the coronal plasma is frozen into the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the emitting plasma structures outline the magnetic field lines ( wiegelmann & solanki 2004 ) .",
    "so in order to identify loop connections well ( see kano & tsuneta 1995 ; kubo & shimizu 2007 ) , the euvi structures are contrast enhanced by using an unsharp mask filter ( refer to feng et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric data from hinode / sp are processed with the routine _sp@xmath9prep.pro_ available in the _ solar software ( ssw ) _ package .",
    "this routine performs standard calibrations such as flat - fielding , dark current correction , polarimetric and instrumental calibration ( ichimoto et al .",
    "2008 ; kubo et al .",
    "the calibrated stokes profiles are analyzed using the vfisv inversion code ( borrero et al .",
    "this code uses the milne@xmath4eddington solution for the radiative transfer equation to produce synthetic stokes profiles that are then compared with the observed ones .",
    "the free parameters of the model are : magnetic field strength @xmath10 , inclination ( @xmath11 ) and azimuth ( @xmath12 ) of the magnetic field vector in the observer s reference frame , line - of - sight ( los ) velocity @xmath13 , continuum to core absorption coefficient @xmath14 , doppler width @xmath15 , source function and source function gradient @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and finally the filling factor of the magnetic component @xmath18 .",
    "we do not consider the damping parameter and macroturbulent velocities as free parameters since their effect can be mimicked by the other thermodynamic parameters and they do not affect the determination of the important quantities such as the magnetic field vector and velocity . with this , we have a total number of 9 free parameters , which are iteratively modified ( using the levenberg@xmath4marquardt non - linear least squares fitting technique ) in other to achieve a better match between synthetic and observed profiles .",
    "the non - magnetic component is obtained by averaging the pixels of the map that possess a polarization signal below the noise level ( 1.2@xmath010@xmath19_i@xmath20 _ , where _ i@xmath20 _ is the continuum intensity ) .",
    "the same non - magnetic component is used in the inversion of all pixels in the map .",
    "our approach is therefore slightly different from that of orozco surez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who employed a local ( average around each inverted pixel ) non - magnetic component .",
    "we have also repeated our inversions following that approach , but our results did not change . given the small amount of scattered light known to exist within the sp instrument on - board hinode ( danilovic et al . 2008 ) , the amount of non - magnetic component @xmath21 can be either interpreted as true non - magnetic unresolved component inside the sp resolution element or as a degradation of the polarization signal due to diffraction ( orozco surez et al .",
    "2007 ) .    the zero los velocity @xmath13 has been obtained by calculating the convective blue - shift in the fe i 6302.5    line using the fourier transform spectrometer atlas at disk center ( fts ; brault & neckel 1987 ) and also by subtracting the solar gravitational red - shift . since the observed region was located close to disk center no further corrections due to solar rotation were necessary .    in the vector field measurements based on the zeeman effect",
    ", there exists a 180 ambiguity in determining the field azimuth , @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is not unresolvable .",
    "potential field approximation is one of the fairly acceptable methods to resolve the ambiguity ( lites et al .",
    "we construct the photospheric vector magnetic fields by computing the potential fields using the sp longitudinal megnetogram , and the azimuth angles with 180 ambiguity are disambiguated by being selected and determined to be close to that we have constructed .",
    "finally , the sp maps are coaligned with the nfi images by using the sp longitudinal magnetogram .    by using the similar method introduced in chae et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we convert the na v / i signals to the los magnetic fields according to the temporally closest sp data .",
    "a linear relation , @xmath22=@xmath23@xmath0v / i , between the circular polarization , v / i , and the line - of - sight field strength , @xmath22 , is applied .",
    "we determine the calibration coefficient , @xmath23 , for each interval partitioned by v / i=@xmath40.07 , @xmath40.06 , ... , 0.09 .",
    "the 18 values of @xmath23 range from 4.0 kg to 12.3 kg and the mean calibration coefficient is 6.8 kg .    the ch boundary ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is determined with the brightness gradient method which was developed by shen et al .",

    "the ch boundary is at the place where _ _ f__=@xmath24__b__@xmath25@xmath24__a__=__f__@xmath26 .",
    "the ch in this study is dominated by the positive polarity ( see the bottom left panel in fig .",
    "1 ) . within a 90@xmath090 region ( outlined by white squares in fig .",
    "1 ) , two dipoles emerge one by one .",
    "we focus on the interaction between the two dipoles and the disappearance of the second dipole from 02 march to 07 march , 2008 .",
    "figure 2 presents the interaction process between the two dipoles .",
    "top panels are time sequence of mdi magnetograms , which show the emergence and interaction of the two dipoles .",

    "loop connections can be seen much more clearly in the contrast enhanced 171  images ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the positive element  a \" of the first dipole ( denoted by arrows  1 \" ) appeared obvious at 09:39 ut 02 march and then grew larger , and brightening point appeared simultaneously at the corresponding location as shown in the leftmost column .",
    "then the negative element ",

    "the second dipole ( indicated by arrows  2 \" ) started to appear in the magnetogram from 20:51 ut 02 march with slightly distinguishable features and became quite obvious at 22:27 ut 02 march .",

    "have been observed , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . at the early emerging stage of the dipole  2 \" , there was a small bright point ( denoted by arrow  1 \" ) at the adjacent area of elements  b \" and  c \" ( top left panel ) .",
    "two and a half minutes later , a jet ( indicated by arrows  2 \" ) rooting at the bright point was observed .",

    "after the eruption , a dimming area appeared ( arrow  c \" ) .",
    "two elements of dipole  2 \" separated as flux continually emerged until 19:01 ut 03 march .",

    "4 . top five panels display the evolution of dipole  2 \" in five days . when the dipole well developed , the flux of each polarity was almost concentrated . as the cancellation began , each pole broke into several fragments",
    ". then these fragments with opposite polarities moved together and cancelled gradually .",
    "accompanying the cancellation process , the corresponding coronal region in 171  images became darker ( middle panels ) , while the general loop connections were not changed much ( bottom panels ) .",
    "however , the loop systems became fewer and fuzzier , and the length of loops became shorter .",
    "at 20:47 ut 03 march , the amount of identifiable loops was 7 while there was no more than 4 at 06:23 ut 05 march . at 19:01",
    "ut 03 march , when the dipole well developed , the length of the longest loop was about 30 mm .",

    "march , only small dispersed elements of dipole  2 \" remained ( bottom right panel in fig .",
    "1 ) . the northeastern part of the ch , where the dipoles were located , appeared as a quiet region and the underlying magnetic fields evolved to mixed polarities ( see the rectangle region in fig .",
    "figure 5 shows the temporal variations of negative and positive magnetic flux in mdi magnetograms and brightness in 171  images obtained from the ellipse region in fig .",
    "4 . in two days , both the negative and positive flux reduced smoothly by 3.4@xmath010@xmath1 mx at a steady cancellation rate of 0.7@xmath010@xmath29 mx h@xmath2 . during this period ,",
    "the brightness in 171  images decreased by about 75% .",

    "two obvious cancellation processes are displayed in fig .",

    "we measure the cancellation rates between the opposite polarities of the second dipole in the calibrated na v / i magnetograms ( within the rectangle area outlined in fig .",
    "it indicates that both the positive and negative polarities decreased at an average rate of 0.8@xmath010@xmath29 mx h@xmath2 during the period of 11:2016:17 on 04 march and of 0.7@xmath010@xmath29 mx h@xmath2 from 11:39 to 15:27 on 05 march .",
    "we also measure the disappearing rate of the two small negative islands shown in fig . 6 . at the pre - cancellation stage , the flux of the two islands is @xmath40.4@xmath010@xmath29 mx ( outlined with circles in the top panels ) and @xmath40.5@xmath010@xmath29 mx ( outlined with octagons in the bottom panels ) , respectively .",

    "the average horizontal velocity is 1.0 km s@xmath2 .",
    "although the v / i magnetograms have been coaligned with the cross - correlation method , there still exists an uncertainty in determining the magnetic island position . a position error ( one pixel )",
    "introduces an error of the velocity of ( one pixel)/(time interval ) . in order to reduce the velocity error , we measure the island position every 6 minutes .",
    "as the size of one pixel is 0.16 and the time interval is 6 minutes , the error becomes 0.3 km s@xmath2 .",

    "observational evidences , e.g. the jet and the plasma eruption exhibited in fig .",

    "when magnetic reconnection occurs , magnetic energy is converted into thermal energy and kinetic energy",
    ". then plasma jet forms and ejects along the field line ( yokoyama & shibata 1995 ) .",
    "accompanying the reconnection , plasma eruption may also be formed due to the change of magnetic configuration .",

    "<S> the opposite polarities of the second dipole separate at first , and then cancel with each other , which is first reported in a coronal hole . with the reduction of unsigned magnetic flux of the second dipole from 9.8@xmath010@xmath1 mx to 3.0@xmath010@xmath1 mx in two days , 171  brightness decreases by 75% and coronal loops </S>",
    "<S> shrink obviously . at the cancellation sites , </S>",
    "<S> the transverse fields are strong and point directly from the positive elements to the negative ones , meanwhile doppler red - shifts with an average velocity of 0.9 km s@xmath2 are observed , comparable to the horizontal velocity ( 1.0 km s@xmath2 ) derived from the cancelling island motion . </S>",
    "<S> several days later , the northeastern part of the coronal hole , where the dipoles are located , appears as a quiet region . </S>",
    "<S> these observations support the idea that the interaction between the two dipoles is caused by flux reconnection , while the cancellation between the opposite polarities of the second dipole is due to the submergence of original loops . </S>",
    "<S> these results will help us to understand coronal hole evolution . </S>"
