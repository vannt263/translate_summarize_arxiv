    "in chaotic and weakly disordered quantum systems which are not self - averaging , phase coherence gives rise to sample - to - sample fluctuations in most transport properties with respect to a small perturbation in the incident energy , an applied magnetic field or the shape of the system .",
    "those fluctuations are universal @xcite and depend only on the symmetry properties , such as the presence or absence of time reversal invariance ( tri ) , and spatial symmetry @xcite .",
    "an statistical analysis is well described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "the parametric dependence of the conductance has been studied experimentally by considering ballistic quantum dots connected to electron reservoirs by ballistic points contacts with few propagating modes @xcite .",
    "rmt predictions can also be verified in wave scattering experimental systems , such as microwave cavities @xcite , acoustic resonators @xcite , or elastic media @xcite , where the external parameters are easy to control .",
    "however , absorption is always present in these experiments and its influence on the universal transport properties is rather dramatic @xcite ; therefore , many theoretical and experimental works have been devoted to the effect of absorption on the transmission @xmath0 and reflection @xmath1 coefficients of the cavity @xcite .",
    "the derivative of those coefficients with respect to the external parameter has not been considered in the presence of absorption .",
    "a parametric derivative is very important in the characterization of mesoscopic systems with a chaotic classical limit @xcite , since it is analogous to the level velocity @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent experiments in microwave cavities @xcite , in the present paper we study the statistical fluctuations of the parametric derivative of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with respect to an external parameter @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the presence of absorption .",
    "we consider a chaotic cavity connected to two waveguides with an arbitrary number of channels , with and without tri , and we address both asymmetric and left - right ( lr ) symmetric cavities . as an external parameter we will take shape deformations .",
    "the purpose of this work is three fold : first , the calculations here presented help to understand the distribution of the energy derivative of @xmath0 in the presence of absorption ; in fact , we now present a complete theoretical derivation of some of the results used in ref . .",
    "second , they also can serve to motivate the experimental analysis of the distribution of the derivative of @xmath0 but with respect to shape deformations , where the results of the present paper can be applied .",
    "that is the case of ref .",
    "where , in order to improve statistics , the shape is modified by varying one lenght of the resonator used in the experiments . finally , in a similar way , the experimental situation of ref",
    "can be used as well to study energy and shape deformation derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "the results presented here are valid for strong absorption .",
