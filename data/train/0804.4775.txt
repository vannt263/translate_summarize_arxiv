    "in two dimensions , particles may obey nontrivial braiding statistics @xcite .",
    "however , a direct observation of these so - called anyons remains one of the most challenging topics in physics .",
    "several good candidates have emerged in the last years among which the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite but the braiding of laughlin quasi - particles has still not been performed despite recent proposals based on mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "interestingly , at a theoretical level , such exotic excitations may also arise in spin systems @xcite .",
    "a simple example is provided by the so - called toric code whose elementary excitations are known to behave as semions @xcite . nevertheless , this model is difficult to implement because it is based on four - spin interactions which are not easily reproduced in experimental set - ups .",
    "a better candidate is undoubtedly the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite which involves only two - spin interactions .",
    "indeed , such a system may be realized experimentally in optical lattices either with cold atoms @xcite or with polar molecules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a suitable parameter range , a perturbative low - energy effective model of the honeycomb model is the toric code @xcite extended with multi - anyon interactions @xcite .",
    "one must however keep in mind that , in the honeycomb model , one also has fermionic excitations which have to be taken into account when braiding anyons @xcite .",
    "the honeycomb model has attracted much attention recently @xcite because it can additionally be solved exactly via different fermionization methods ( majorana fermions@xcite or jordan - wigner transformations@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting extensions of this model suggested in kitaev s seminal paper @xcite has been proposed by yao and kivelson @xcite who considered the same kind of model but on the triangle - honeycomb lattice .",
    "indeed , in the presence of odd cycles , the system spontaneously breaks the time - reversal symmetry and has two topologically distinct gapped phases characterized by abelian and non - abelian excitations . in their study",
    ", yao and kivelson showed that the ground state is a chiral spin liquid associated to an odd chern number ( note that such an exotic state of matter has also been found in another spin model @xcite ) .",
    "their whole analysis relies on an exact treatment of the vortex - free sector ( see below for details ) which allows them to compute the fermionic gap .",
    "however , as in the honeycomb model , although the ground state belongs to this subspace , the low - energy states are known to lie in other vortex sectors for a wide range of parameters in the abelian phase .",
    "in contrast , near the transition point , the fermionic gap in the vortex - free sector is smaller than the vortex gap @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze this low - energy spectrum following and extending the procedure developed in ref .   for the honeycomb model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the kitaev model on the triangle - honeycomb lattice and discuss its symmetries .",
    "section [ sec : dimer ] is devoted to the perturbative treatment in the isolated - dimer limit .",
    "there , we first map the spin model onto an effective spin - boson system which is well suited to our analysis .",
    "we show that the low - energy effective hamiltonian is related to the toric code on the honeycomb lattice although , at lowest nontrivial order ( six ) , one only has magnetic - like operators .",
    "this straightforwardly implies that the low - energy excitations are abelian anyons with a semionic mutual statistics .",
    "we also compute the two - spin correlation functions for any vortex configuration up to order 6 and check our results for two simple vortex configurations ( vortex - free and vortex - full ) which allow for nonperturbative calculations . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangle ] , we consider the isolated - triangle limit  ; we show that the effective low - energy hamiltonian is , at lowest order ( one ) , exactly the kitaev honeycomb model at the isotropic point .",
    "the next - order correction involves three - spin interactions as well as triangular plaquette degrees of freedom . in the vortex - free sector , this term is exactly the one studied by kitaev@xcite , which opens a gap , and gives rise to non - abelian excitations .",
    "contrary to the isolated - dimer limit , one can not diagonalize the effective hamiltonian for arbitrary vortex configurations .",
    "thus , we focus on the vortex - free sector and compute the fermionic gap in this limit , which is a check of our perturbative expansion .",
    "we consider the kitaev model on the triangle - honeycomb lattice obtained by replacing each site of the honeycomb lattice by a triangle and described by the following hamiltonian  : @xmath0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 takes values @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 , and links of type @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dechoney ] . in the above formula , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the two sites of the @xmath1 or @xmath10 link . without loss of generality",
    "@xcite , we also consider ferromagnetic interactions @xmath11 .",
    "this lattice contains six sites per unit cell , and two kinds of elementary plaquettes  : triangles and dodecagons . as in the original kitaev honeycomb model",
    ", @xmath12 commutes with all plaquette operators defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the outgoing direction at site @xmath8 with respect to the plaquette @xmath15 .",
    "note that with this definition , plaquette operators have real eigenvalues @xmath16 , whereas , with the convention proposed in ref .",
    ", one has @xmath17 for odd - loop operators .    as suggested in ref .",
    ", in the following , we further set @xmath18 so that the hamiltonian @xmath12 respects the symmetries of the lattice .",
    "it is also time - reversal invariant since it is quadratic in the spin operators .",
    "however , as explained by kitaev @xcite , the presence of odd cycles ( here due to triangles ) breaks this symmetry spontaneously .",
    "this symmetry breaking may be understood by noting that changing the flux of all triangles , i.e. , flipping their @xmath19 s , does not change the energy so that each eigenstate is , at least , two - fold degenerate @xcite .    as in the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath12 can be mapped onto a free ( majorana ) fermion problem which allows for an exact solution .",
    "thus , in each vortex sector defined by a configuration of the @xmath19 s one has a fermionic spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the low - energy states may be given by ground states of other vortex sectors and , when the corresponding flux configurations are not translation invariant , one is led to solve an impurity - like problem . in ref .",
    ", yao and kivelson numerically showed that the ground state of @xmath12 always lies in the vortex - free sector ( @xmath20 for all @xmath15 ) and supported this analysis by perturbative considerations @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall see that this is verified in the first perturbative limit we consider ( isolated dimers ) , whereas we did not manage to prove it in the other limit .",
    "in addition , in the isolated - dimer limit described in sec .  [ sec : dimer ] , we compute the low - energy spectrum for all vortex configurations and give a perturbative expansion of the anyonic gap .",
    "our goal is to perform a perturbative analysis of the abelian phase around the isolated - dimer limit @xmath21 .",
    "to do so , we shall use the effective spin boson mapping introduced in ref .",
    "but , for convenience , let us first perform the following rotations  : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cycle operator which maps @xmath24 onto @xmath25 . here",
    ", each site is encoded by a cell index @xmath26 and a position index @xmath27 inside the cell as shown in fig .",

    "fig : dechoney ] is simply @xmath30 . denoting @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) as the eigenstate of @xmath33 with eigenvalue of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , each cyan dimer can be in four different states , @xmath36 an alternative description of these four states consists in interpreting the low - energy ( ferro - magnetic ) states as two effective spin states without a quasiparticle and the high - energy ( antiferro - magnetic ) states as two effective spin states with one quasiparticle .",

    "[ fig : kagome ] . within this formalism , the plaquette operators read @xmath55 for triangles and @xmath56 for the dodecagonal plaquette ( which are hexagonal in the effective lattice ) located below the cell @xmath26 ( see notations in fig .  [",
    "fig : kagome ] ) .",
    "the main interest of this mapping is that the form of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hcut ] ) is especially adapted to the perturbative treatment developed in the sec .",
    "[ subsec : spectrum ] . indeed , a key ingredient of our approach which is based on the continuous unitary transformations @xcite together with the particle - number conserving generator @xcite is that the energy spectrum of the unperturbed hamiltonian has to be equidistant .          in this section ,",
    "we used exactly the same method as those described in refs .   and for the kitaev honeycomb model .",
    "therefore , we skipped all technical details and only give here the results of our calculations .",
    "first , let us note that , in the triangle - honeycomb lattice , one has @xmath57 where @xmath49 is the number of cyan dimers and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 stand , respectively for sites , triangles ( so @xmath61 ) , and dodecagons ( or effective hexagons , so @xmath62 ) .",
    "there are thus as many conserved @xmath63 plaquette operators @xmath64 as the number @xmath49 of effective spin 1/2 .",
    "this implies that in the low - energy subspace with no hardcore boson , the effective hamiltonian can , in the isolated - dimer limit @xmath21 , be written only in terms of the plaquette operators , and is thus readily solved .",
    "the general form of this effective hamiltonian reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes a set of @xmath67 plaquettes .",
    "we performed this perturbative expansion of the effective hamiltonian up to order @xmath68 which is the lowest order involving multi - plaquette interactions . at this order ,",
    "the constant term is given by @xmath69 the first nontrivial contribution arises at order 6 where only hexagonal - plaquette operators are involved . at order 8 ,",
    "this latter term is renormalized and triangular - plaquette operators come into play .",
    "more precisely , one has @xmath70 where the first sum is performed over all hexagonal plaquettes @xmath71 ( i.e. @xmath72 ) and the second one over triplet plaquettes made of one hexagon @xmath71 and two triangles @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( of any kind @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) adjacent to this hexagon . at order 8 , the coefficients are given by @xmath77 thus , at order 6 , the spectrum does not depend on the fluxes inside the triangles and this degeneracy is only partially lifted at order 8 .",
    "note that the signs of @xmath78 and @xmath79 confirm , in this limit , that ( one of ) the ground state lies in the vortex - free sector ( @xmath20 for all plaquettes ) as conjectured in ref .  .",
    "in addition , we emphasize that triangular - plaquette operators appear by pairs which are reminiscent from the time - reversal symmetry that the effective hamiltonian must satisfy ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to interpret this result in terms of plaquettes and vertex operators .",
    "therefore , one may view the effective kagome lattice as a honeycomb lattice where each site lies in the middle of the triangles as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome ] . within this picture , the plaquette operators @xmath80",
    "are interpreted as flux ( magnetic ) operators , whereas @xmath81 appear as vertex ( electric ) operators . in this gauge theory language used in the toric - code model @xcite ,",
    "our results show that , at lowest order , there is no contribution of the vertex operators .",
    "thus , the triangle - honeycomb lattice , in this isolated - dimer limit does not map onto a standard toric - code - like problem .",
    "however , the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian are those of the toric code on the hexagonal lattice and , as such , display anyonic statistics . to be more precise",
    ", one must distinguish between electric and magnetic excitations which are localized on triangles and hexagons ( in the kagome lattice ) , respectively .",
    "these two kinds of excitations have mutual semionic statistics @xcite but they individually behave as bosons .",
    "finally , let us remark that the gaps of magnetic excitations ( order of magnitude @xmath82 ) and of electric excitations ( order of magnitude @xmath83 ) are even smaller than the gap in the kitaev honeycomb model ( order of magnitude @xmath84 ) .",
    "this would make an experimental detection of anyons in the triangle - honeycomb model even more problematic than in the honeycomb model @xcite .      as in the kitaev honeycomb model ,",
    "any correlator involving an odd number of spin operators vanishes although the eigenstates break the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "indeed , as discussed by yao and kivelson @xcite , every eigenstate is , at least , two - fold degenerate since one can flip every triangular plaquette without changing the energy but _ this operation is global_. consequently , as in the honeycomb model @xcite , the only nonvanishing correlators are products of @xmath85 on an @xmath1 dimers . here",
    ", we focus on the simplest case involving only one such object , i.e. , @xmath86 .    in the triangle - honeycomb model ,",
    "one has , _ a priori _ , nine different functions to consider since the unit cell contains nine different dimers .",
    "however , with the choice of the couplings we made , one only has two different functions to distinguish : those on `` weak '' bonds ( @xmath87 links with interaction @xmath88 ) and those on `` strong '' bonds ( @xmath89 links with interaction @xmath90 ) . as for the low - energy spectrum ,",
    "one expects a plaquette - operator expansion as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hefflow ] ) . we performed the calculation of these two correlation functions up to order 6 and",
    "obtained @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the two dodecagonal plaquettes shared by the considered strong bond @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , since we set @xmath94 , we found for a weak bond @xmath29 @xmath95 where @xmath15 is the dodecagonal plaquette adjacent to the considered bond .",
    "as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cfzz ] ) and ( [ eq : cfxx ] ) , the presence of a vortex is detected at orders 6 and 5 , respectively .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that one analyzes the isolated - dimer limit for which , at lowest order , @xmath96 whereas @xmath97 .      to check our results we computed exactly the ground - state energy in the vortex - free ( full ) sector for which @xmath20 ( -1 ) for all @xmath15 using majorana fermions as described by kitaev for the honeycomb model @xcite .",
    "following , the procedure described in ref .  , we performed a perturbative expansion of the exact solutions order by order . denoting @xmath98 the ground - state energy per cyan dimer for a vortex filling factor @xmath99 one",
    "gets @xmath100 keeping in mind that the number of hexagons is @xmath101 and that for each hexagon @xmath102 , there are 15 triplets @xmath103 , these results are straightforwardly recovered using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e0])-([eq : c ] ) .",
    "one can also check the expression of the correlation functions in these vortex configurations .",

    "( [ eq : hf_zz ] ) [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf_xx ] ) ] is performed over all strong bonds ( weak bonds ) in the initial lattice .",
    "the last equalities stem from the fact that for @xmath105 every plaquette has the same contribution which would not be true for other vortex configurations . using eqs .",

    "these triangles live on the sites of an effective hexagonal lattice . for convenience ,",
    "we use rotated form ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) that was already used in the isolated - dimer limit .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian of an isolated triangle is made of two sets of fourfold - degenerate levels . in each of these sets ,",
    "two levels have eigenvalue @xmath106 and the other two @xmath107 . setting @xmath109 ,",

    "this hardcore boson degree of freedom , which we again denote as @xmath111 , together with the @xmath63 quantum number @xmath112 span a four - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "it is then natural to introduce an effective spin 1/2 to span the full eight - dimensional hilbert space of a triangle .",
    "we again denote this effective spin as @xmath113 ( though it is not the same as in the other perturbative limit , and the same remark holds for @xmath111 ) .",
    "the way this effective spin is introduced is partly dictated by the operators involved in the adjacent dodecagonal - plaquette operators . for the triangle @xmath114 of fig .",
