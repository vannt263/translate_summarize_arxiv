    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are the primary reservoir of molecular gas in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "since the surface density of star formation shows a strong correlation with the surface density of molecular gas @xcite , gmcs must also be the primary site of star formation in the milky way .",
    "however , recent high - resolution observations have shown that the kennicutt - schmidt law breaks down when the resolution of an observation is finer than the typical length scales of gmcs @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to develop a detailed theoretical understanding of the relationship between star formation and molecular gas , it is necessary to first understand the formation , evolution , and destruction of giant molecular clouds .",
    "one stumbling block in this effort is the substantial disagreement in the literature regarding both the formation mechanism and typical lifetimes of gmcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some authors suggest that gmcs form out of bound atomic gas as a result of gravitational instability @xcite , surviving as roughly virialized objects for many cloud dynamical times @xcite . in support of this picture",
    "is the observation that massive clouds are found to be marginally bound , with typical virial parameters of order unity @xcite . since supersonic isothermal turbulence",
    "is found to decay via radiative shocks in one or two crossing times @xcite , this model must invoke a mechanism to drive supersonic motions for the lifetime of a cloud , which could be several crossing times .",
    "possible turbulent driving mechanisms include protostellar outflows @xcite , h  ii regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter km09 ) , supernovae @xcite , or , as investigated here , mass accretion @xcite .",
    "accretion driven turbulence in molecular clouds has received little attention in the literature . however , as @xcite point out , the kinetic energy of accreted material can power the turbulent motions observed in molecular clouds with energy conversion efficiencies of only a few percent .",
    "while there has been no systematic study of the kinetic energy budget of a molecular cloud formed via gravitational instability , this problem has been examined in the context of the formation of protogalaxies at high redshift . in one example , @xcite analyzed simulations of virializing high redshift minihalos , tracking the thermal , kinetic , and gravitational potential energy of gas in protogalactic dark matter halos . in their models , which included a nonequilibrium cooling model , gas collapsed onto the halo and cooled quickly , causing turbulent velocities to become supersonic .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this means that the virialization process is a local one : gravitational potential energy can be converted directly into supersonically turbulent motions characterized by a volume - filling network of shocks .",
    "the turbulence in turn provides much of the kinetic support for the newly virialized gaseous component of the dark matter halo .",
    "if a similar mechanism is at work as gas cools and collapses onto gmcs then gravitational potential energy alone may be sufficient to power turbulence in gmc .    the most detailed simulations of simultaneously accreting and star forming giant molecular clouds were recently completed by @xcite",
    ". these numerical models included a simplified subgrid prescription for stellar feedback by the ionizing radiation of newborn star clusters and focused on the balance between accretion and feedback in clouds formed via thermal instability in colliding flows .",
    "throughout the course of the simulation , dense molecular gas condensed out of a warm atomic envelope , allowing a study of the interplay between accretion and feedback in the simulated clouds .",
    "the resulting clouds were able to attain a state of quasi - virial equilibrium , in which the supply of gas from the ambient medium balanced the formation of stars and ejection of gas from h  ii regions . due to the idealized nature of the subgrid star formation feedback prescription , in which all h  ii regions were powered by a cluster with the same ionizing luminosity , star formation feedback was unable to act on the cloud as a whole but",
    "could reduce the global star formation rate by destroying overdensities .",
    "since the simulation did not include star clusters with large ionizing luminosities , the cloud as a whole could not be destroyed and star formation would have eventually consumed all of the gas had the simulation not been cut off . even though the simulations employed a highly idealized star formation prescription , the computations still required substantial resources to complete and only allowed insight into the evolution of a single cloud .",
    "it seems that a computationally inexpensive model that includes a somewhat more sophisticated treatment of star formation feedback is called for .    in this work , we model the global evolution of giant molecular clouds from their birth as low - mass seed clouds to their dispersal after a phase of massive star formation",
    "this is done using an updated version of the semianalytical model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . using a virial formalism , we compute the global dynamical evolution of a single cloud while simultaneously tracking its energy budget .",
    "model clouds form stars , launch h  ii regions and undergo accretion from their environments . with these models , we are able to investigate the role accretion plays in maintaining turbulence in molecular clouds and directly compare to observations of gmcs in the milky way and nearby external galaxies .",
    "this work is complementary to the simulations of @xcite , since our simplified global models allow us to survey a large variety of gmcs at little computational cost while including a much more sophisticated star formation feedback prescription .",
    "we are able to capture model clouds with masses comparable to the most massive clouds observed in the milky way and nearby galaxies , allowing us to simulate the sites of the majority of star formation in these systems @xcite .",
    "we proceed by describing the formulation and implementation of our gmc model in  [ gmcevolution ] .",
    "next , in  [ varphivary ] , we test our implementation of accretion . following this , in ",
    "[ fullsims ] we perform full simulations and describe the gneral features of our simulated clouds . in  [ obscompare ]",
    "we make comparisons to observations , focusing on the scaling relations observed to hold for gmcs as well as the high quality multiwavelength observations available for gmcs in the lmc .",
    "lastly , in  [ caveats ] , we discuss the limitations inherent in the simplifying assumptions we make to derive the cloud evolution equations .",
    "the gmc evolution model described below allows us to solve for the time - evolution of the global properties of model molecular clouds .",
    "in contrast with previous work , we follow the flow of gas as it condenses out of the diffuse gas in the envelope surrounding the gmc and falls onto the cloud . employing simplifying assumptions as well as the results of simulations of compressible mhd turbulence , we derive a set of coupled ordinary differential equations that govern the time evolution of the cloud s mass , radius , and velocity dispersion . combining the governing evolution equations with a set of initial conditions , model parameters , and a model for the time dependence of the mass accretion rate based on the gravitational collapse of the gmc envelope",
    ", we can solve for the time evolution of the cloud .",
    "below , we give an overview of the model , discuss the formulation of our numerical scheme , describe our parameter choices , and give a brief description of our treatment of star formation and our model for the gmcs gas supply .",
    "the model we employ below is based on the global gmc model of paper i , itself a generalization of the the global model for low mass star formation of @xcite , the eulerian virial theorem ( evt ) of @xcite , and the model for star forming clumps of @xcite . employing a virial formalism",
    ", we account for the dynamics and energy budget of gas contained within an eulerian volume , @xmath1 .",
    "we separate the gas within @xmath2 into three species : virial material , a gaseous reservoir , and a photoionized wind .",
    "a schematic representation of the components of our model is presented in figure  [ modelcartoon ] .    by design ,",
    "each of the three components has a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the first component , which we label virial material , consists of two physically distinct subcomponents : a molecular cloud and a warm atomic envelope that encloses the cloud .",
    "the cloud is assumed to be cold ( @xmath3 ) , molecular , and contained within a spherical volume of radius @xmath4 .",
    "the ambient medium is composed of warm ( @xmath5 ) and diffuse atomic gas that encloses the cloud and extends beyond the virial volume .",
    "the second component is a gaseous reservoir , which we assume is composed of cold ( @xmath6 ) neutral material that flows onto the cloud at free - fall from beyond the virial volume .",
    "the last component is an ionized wind made up of hot ( @xmath7 ) ionized gas ejected from the ionization fronts of blister - type h  ii regions .",
    "all three components are allowed to mutually interpenetrate .",
    "we restrict interaction between the components to the transfer of mass between the accretion flow and cloud as well as between the cloud and wind . since the envelope and cloud are not allowed to interpenetrate , we formally group the envelope and cloud together",
    "; this somewhat artificial choice significantly simplifies the virial analysis .",
    "we make use of two simplifying assumptions regarding the distribution and flow of the virial material .",
    "first , we assume that the virial material follows a spherically symmetric , smoothly varying density profile .",
    "second , we assume that the the cloud is homologous : the cloud expands , contracts , accretes , and sheds mass in such a way as to always maintain the same smooth density profile .",
    "we assume a density profile of the form @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the density at the edge of the cloud and @xmath10 is assumed to be unity .",
    "this choice is consistent with the larson scaling relations observed in galactic @xcite and extragalactic @xcite gmcs .",
    "our assumed cloud density profile effectively averages over clumpy and filamentary internal structure and oblate shapes of observed clouds . at @xmath11 , the density of the ambient medium",
    "is assumed to smoothly transition from @xmath9 to @xmath12 in a thin boundary layer .",
    "we assume that the density of the ambient medium is negligible compared to the density of gas in the cloud , @xmath13 .",
    "the density of the ambient medium remains @xmath12 out to the virial radius .    beyond assuming a density profile",
    ", we must also specify the velocity structure of all three components of the model .",
    "we follow paper i in assuming that the velocity of the virial material can be decomposed into a systematic and turbulent component , @xmath14    we assume that @xmath15 is randomly oriented with respect to position so that turbulent motions carry no net flux of matter .",
    "we make a similar assumption regarding the velocity structure of the reservoir , @xmath16    the systematic component of @xmath17 is due to the gravitational attraction of material within the virial volume @xmath18    while the random component is such that @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath21 is the velocity dispersion of gas in the reservoir feeding the accretion flow .",
    "since the amount of material in the accretion flow is determined by how fast it can fall into the cloud , we must simultaneously determine both the density profile and radial velocity of material in the accretion flow ( see appendix  [ accretionappendix ] ) .",
    "finally , for the wind material , we follow paper i in assuming    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the ionized gas sound speed .",
    "we follow @xcite in choosing @xmath25 .      in appendix  [ derivationevt ] , we derive the evt for a simultaneously evaporating and accreting cloud , @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is a constant of order unity that depends on the distribution of material in the cloud , @xmath28 is the cloud moment of inertia , @xmath29 is the combined turbulent and thermal kinetic energy of the cloud , @xmath30 is the energy associated with interstellar pressure at the cloud surface , @xmath31 is the net magnetic energy due to the presence of the cloud , @xmath32 is the gravitational term ( equal to the gravitational binding energy in the absence of an external potential [ @xcite ] ) , the surface integral is proportional to the rate of change of the moment of inertia inside the bounding viral surface , @xmath33 is the cloud mass , @xmath34 is the cloud radius , @xmath35 is the mass ejection rate , @xmath36 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath37/ r_{\\rm cl}\\}^{1/2}$ ] is the escape velocity at the edge of the cloud , and @xmath38 is a dimensionless factor we compute via equation  ( [ xidef ] ) that depends on the depth of the cloud potential well . the quantity @xmath39 is the accretion rate weighted average infall velocity .",
    "precise definitions for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are given in paper i.    the evt of a cloud without accretion or mass loss would only contain the terms up to the surface integral .",
    "the next three terms account for changes in the cloud moment of inertia due to changes in the mass of the cloud , while the last term accounts for the rate at which the recoil of inflowing and outflowing mass injects momentum into the cloud .",
    "inflows and outflows are treated separately because material is ejected at a constant velocity , but is accreted at a velocity that is a function of the depth of the potential well of the cloud .",
    "the dimensionless factor @xmath38 appears due to this difference .",
    "the mass of the cloud can only change via mass accretion or ejection , @xmath40    we assume that ejection of material can only decrease the mass of the cloud and accretion can only increase the mass of the cloud . since stars may not follow the homologous density profile we assume , we neglect the change in the cloud mass due to star formation .",
    "we expect the error incurred from this assumption will be small , since stars make up a small fraction of the mass of observed clouds @xcite and our assumed star formation law converts a small fraction of the cloud s mass into stars per free - fall time .",
    "we follow paper i in using the assumption of homology and the results of simulations of mhd turbulence to evaluate each term in the evt in terms of constants and the dynamical variables @xmath34 , @xmath33 , and @xmath41 . in the end",
    ", we obtain a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation in @xmath4 , @xmath42 here , @xmath43,\\ ] ] @xmath44 is the ratio of the mass of reservoir material to the mass of cloud material contained within a normalized radius @xmath45 ( see appendix  [ accretionappendix ] ) , and @xmath46 is the ratio of the magnetic critical mass to the cloud mass .",
    "this equation governs the balance of forces acting on the cloud as a whole .",
    "each term corresponds to a single physical mechanism that can alter the radial force balance .",
    "the first two terms are due to thermal and turbulent pressure support , respectively .",
    "the third is due to a combination of gravitational compression and magnetic support .",
    "the fourth is due to the confining interstellar pressure .",
    "the fifth comes from the exchange of momentum between the expanding cloud and infalling accretion flow . finally , the last term is due to a combination of the recoil from ejected material and the ram pressure of accreting material .",
    "although the two parts of the recoil term have opposite signs , @xmath35 and @xmath47 have opposite signs as well : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that both the recoil due to launching wind material and the ram pressure of accreting reservoir material tend to confine the cloud .",
    "letting @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 be the cloud mass , radius , and velocity dispersion at @xmath53 and defining the initial cloud crossing time , @xmath54 , we can define the dimensionless variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "letting primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath59 , we can write equation  ( [ reqn1 ] ) in dimensionless form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial turbulent mach number and we define the dimensionless constants @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the initial nonthermal virial parameter @xcite . these constants are set by the ratios of various forces acting on the initial state of the cloud .",
    "@xmath64 is proportional to the ratio of the initial magnetic forces to the initial gravitational force , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the ratios of the ambient pressure force , the mass ejection recoil force , and the initial accretion ram pressure force to the initial internal turbulent forces , respectively .    comparing equation  ( [ reqn ] ) with the corresponding equation given in paper i , we see that two new terms proportional to @xmath68 have appeared . in practice , we find that , of the two terms , the one proportional to @xmath67 dominates , implying that the primary direct impact of accretion on the radial force balance of the cloud is to provide a confining ram pressure",
    ". we will see in the next section that accretion also increases the turbulent velocity dispersion , implying that the kinetic pressure term also increases when accretion is included .",
    "the cloud radius is determined by a balance between kinetic pressure and a combination of gravity , accretion ram pressure , and wind recoil pressure .",
    "thermal pressure support is negligible .",
    "we also note that although the ambient pressure term is of the same form as in paper i , we assume an observationally motivated value for the ambient pressure , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this includes thermal and turbulent pressure but neglects magnetic and cosmic ray pressure , since magnetic fields and cosmic rays permeate both the cloud and the ambient ism .",
    "we have also adjusted the ambient pressure upwards by a factor of two because gmcs form in overdense regions of the ism where the hydrostatic pressure is higher than average . in paper",
    "i , @xmath70 was chosen to be artificially high to ensure that the cloud would start its evolution in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this choice was made to account for the weight of the gaseous reservoir that was not explicitly included . in practice , by choosing a lower value for @xmath70 , we find that the ambient pressure term is subdominant for most of the evolution of the cloud .",
    "this is expected , since we now correctly account for the pressure of the reservoir through the term proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "once accretion halts , the cloud is left out of pressure equilibrium and must expand to match the ambient pressure .",

    "since motions in gmcs are highly supersonic , the internal structure of a typical cloud is characterized by strong shocks .",

    ". we will show in  [ energetics ] that the velocity dispersion is set by a balance between the decay of turbulence and energy injected by accretion and star formation .",
    "star formation is able to influence the evolution of the cloud by ejecting mass and by injecting turbulent kinetic energy as expanding h  ii regions merge with and drive turbulent motions in the cloud .",

    "if the total ionizing luminosity of the newborn star cluster is sufficient to drive the expansion of an h  ii region , we begin to track the resulting expansion .    once a massive star cluster forms , it photoionizes gas in its surroundings and drives the expansion of an h  ii region .",
    "paper i tracked the expansion of individual h  ii regions by assuming the analytic self - similar solution for h  ii region expansion worked out by @xcite .",
    "this solution uses the fact that once an h  ii region has expanded beyond the strmgren radius , most of the mass in the h  ii region volume is in a thin shell of atomic gas at a radius @xmath107 from the center of the h  ii region .",

    "the total force is given by the sum of the gas pressure and radiation pressure forces , @xmath125 .",
    "at early times , when @xmath126 , the radiation force dominates , so @xmath127 .",
    "thus , if we calculate the mass ejection rate from the the total force acting on the shell , we will overestimate the mass ejection rate in a radiation pressure dominated h  ii region . to correct for this effect ,",

    "once the stars providing 50% of the total ionizing luminosity of the central star cluster have left the main sequence , the h  ii region enters an undriven momentum - conserving snowplow phase . when the expansion velocity of the h  ii region is comparable to the turbulent velocity dispersion , we assume that the h  ii region breaks up and contributes turbulent kinetic energy to the cloud .",
    "h  ii regions can merge with the cloud during either the driven or undriven phases . if the radius of the h  ii region is greater than the radius of the cloud and the expansion velocity of the shell is greater than the cloud escape velocity , we say the h  ii region disrupts the cloud and end the global evolution .",
    "if an h  ii region merges with the cloud at time @xmath130 when its radius is @xmath131 , the rate of energy injection from a single h  ii region is given by    @xmath132    here @xmath133 , @xmath66 paramaterizes the efficiency of energy injection , @xmath134 is the dirac delta function , and the factor of 1.6 arises because magnetic turbulence is slightly sub - equipartition compared to kinetic turbulence .",
    "the factor @xmath135 accounts for the more rapid decay of turbulence when the driving scale is smaller ( see paper i ) .",
    "consistent with the analysis in appendix  [ accretionappendix ] , we treat the reservoir as a gravitationally unstable spherical cloud undergoing collapse . the cloud is primarily composed of atomic gas in both warm and cold phases .",

    "we approximate that the reservoir has approximately constant surface density , @xmath136 . to find an upper limit on the mass accretion rate , we can assume that the reservoir is undergoing collapse in the limit of zero pressure .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the resulting accretion rate onto the central condensation is given by @xmath137 since the estimate for the accretion rate given in equation  [ mdotaccff ] does not take into account pressure support , it is likely an overestimate of the true accretion rate .",

    "this would also allow us to self - consistently model the end of accretion onto the cloud instead of assuming that mass accretion cuts off abruptly . in a forthcoming paper , we plan to add our molecular cloud models to a simulation of gas dynamics in a galactic disk to model the gas reservoir for a population of gmcs .",

    "the surface density corresponding to the dissociation threshold depends on the assumed dust to gas ratio and thus on the metallicity . for solar metallicity",
    ", a surface density of @xmath177 corresponds to @xmath178 .",
    "since we use a dissociation threshold based on co rather than h@xmath179 to define the end of the cloud s life , we may miss the further evolution of a diffuse molecular cloud where most of the carbon is neutral or singly ionized but the hydrogen is still molecular .    these halting conditions probably oversimplify the true end of a cloud s evolution due to our assumption of spherical symmetry and homology .",
    "for the case of collapse , it is more likely that the cloud would undergo runaway fragmentation rather than monolithic collapse . in the case of dissociation , even if the mean surface density drops below the point where co can no longer remain molecular , that does not preclude the possibility that overdense clumps might retain significant amounts of co. finally , for the case of disruption , even if an h  ii region delivered a large enough impulse to unbind the cloud , it may simply be displaced as a whole , or be disrupted into multiple pieces which would then evolve independently .",
    "it is also likely that if the cloud is disrupted while still actively accreting , the cloud would inevitably recollapse since it is unlikely that an h  ii region would have enough kinetic energy to unbind the reservoir .    since we must necessarily use simple criteria to halt the cloud evolution , our estimates of cloud lifetimes presented below are strictly lower limits to the true lifetime of a cloud .",
    "both the disruption and dissociation criteria do not preclude the presence of overdense clumps that may survive the destruction events . however , our estimates of cloud lifetimes are appropriate for the lifetime of a single monolithic cloud .",

    "the clouds evolve in much the same way as the massive cloud models considered in paper i. the clouds can be supported against self - gravity for many dynamical times by forming stars and launching h  ii regions .",
    "particularly energetic h  ii regions can disrupt the clouds and excursions to low surface density can dissociate the clouds .",

    "if @xmath79 is higher , star formation becomes completely negligible , and the amount of kinetic energy injection is controlled by the mass accretion rate . since clouds collapse when we choose @xmath79 much lower than our fiducial value , and shocks in molecular gas tend to be strongly dissipative , we do not expect the ` true ' value of @xmath79 to be much different than our fiducial value .",
    "we thus conclude that one of three cases must hold .",
    "star formation may be dominant , but only marginally so .",

    "the fact that @xmath246 is sensitive to @xmath136 follows from dimensional analysis .",
    "we next compare our simulated clouds with the linewidth - size relation observed to hold among gmcs as a population @xcite .",
    "we are able to reproduce the power law , scatter , and the rough normalization in the observed linewidth - size relation .",
    "this conclusion is unsurprising , since we have already seen that our simulated clouds maintain roughly constant virial parameters and surface densities as they evolve .",
    "it is worth noting that for our simplified model for the environment of a gmc , that the linewidth - size relation corresponds to an age sequence .",
    "clouds that live towards the left - hand side of the diagram are younger than clouds that live towards the right .",
    "it is possible that this conclusion is an artifact of choosing a single reservoir mass .",
    "clouds accreting from a population of reservoirs with a continuous spectrum of masses may blur this effect somewhat .",
    "we plan to revisit this in future work in which we will model the global ism of a galaxy simultaneously with the evolution of a population of gmcs .",
    "there is a small offset when comparing the locus of extragalactic and outer milky way clouds with our models , although there is good agreement between our models and the scaling found by @xcite . for a subset of the observational sample , particularly the smc clouds ,",
    "it is possible that the metallicity of the gas in the clouds is so low that co is no longer a good tracer of the bulk of the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "since our models assume perfect sphericity , and the observed radius of a prolate or oblate spheroid will always be smaller than the corresponding spherical radius @xcite , it is also possible that the radii predicted by our models overpredict the corresponding observed cloud radius by 0.1 or 0.2 dex .",
    "lastly , it could be the that we overpredict the various pressures due to photoionization and accretion by assuming spherical symmetry . in reality",
    ", the wind and accretion ram pressure may not necessarily be perfectly spherically symmetric , leading to a reduction in the overall confining pressure and an increase in the radius .",
    "the large magellanic cloud is home to one of the best - studied samples of gmcs in any galaxy .",
    "the lmc s disk - like geometry and face - on orientation offers little ambiguity in distance measurements , with the most accurate measurements giving @xmath260 @xcite .",
    "a large quantity of high - quality multiwavelength data has been obtained for the entire disk of the galaxy . in particular , the nanten @xmath261co @xmath262 surveys and high - resolution followup from the magma @xmath261co @xmath262 survey @xcite have mapped the molecular content of the entire disk of the lmc and identified 272 clouds that together contain @xmath263 of molecular gas . when combined with multiwavelength archival observations of star formation indicators ,",
    "these co data constitute a snapshot in the evolution and star formation history of a population of gmcs .",
    "@xcite used the nanten co @xmath264 data , along with complementary h@xmath265 photometry @xcite , radio continuum maps at @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 @xcite and a map of young @xmath269 clusters extracted from @xmath270 photometry @xcite to investigate the ongoing star formation within gmcs in the lmc .",
    "these authors found a strong tendency for h  ii regions and young clusters to be spatially correlated with gmcs . using this association , the gmcs in their sample",
    "were separated into three types .",
    "type 1 gmcs are defined to be starless in the sense that they are not associated with detectable h  ii regions or young clusters , type 2 gmcs are associated with h  ii regions , but not young clusters in the cluster catalog , and type 3 gmcs are associated with both h  ii regions and young clusters .",
    "@xmath271 of the nanten sample were classified as type 1 , @xmath272 as type 2 , and @xmath273 as type 3 .",
    "assuming that gmcs and clusters are formed in steady state and assuming that young clusters not associated with gmcs are associated with gmcs that have dissipated , one can infer from the nanten population statistics that gmcs spend @xmath274 in the type 1 phase , @xmath275 in the type 2 phase , @xmath276 in the type 3 phase , and then dissipate within @xmath277 .",
    "this accounting implies gmc lifetimes of approximately @xmath278 . in support of the claim that the gmc classification scheme constitutes an evolutionary sequence ,",
    "the authors note that among the resolved gmcs in the nanten survey , type 3 gmcs are on average more massive , have larger turbulent line widths , and have larger radii .",
    "however , there is significant scatter in the type 3 gmc sample and the mass and size evolution are well within their error bars .    in order to correct for extinction , which might obscure h@xmath265 emitting h  ii regions , radio continuum maps at three",
    ", well - separated frequencies were used to identify obscured h  ii regions via their flat spectral slopes .",
    "however , no h  ii regions were identified in the radio continuum data that were not present in the h@xmath265 maps , leading the authors to conclude that the h@xmath265 data was unaffected by obscuration .",
    "no similar analysis was performed to estimate obscuration of young star clusters .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for the varying sensitivities in the different radio maps , allowing for the possibility that some h  ii regions were detected at 1.4 ghz but below the sensitivity limit at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz .",
    "there are several observational biases inherent in the gmc classification scheme described above .",
    "the first is the probable existence of star clusters and h  ii regions located either behind or within giant molecular clouds from our viewpoint .",
    "high dust extinction along these sightlines would mask some young clusters from detection in the @xcite star cluster sample .",
    "this could lead to an overestimate of type 2 gmcs relative to type 3 gmcs .",
    "another possible bias is the use of the @xcite star cluster catalog .",
    "clusters in this catalog were targeted for @xmath270 photometry based on brightness and association with emission nebulae .",
    "it is possible that some young clusters were missed in this catalog and no attempt is made by kawamura et al . to correct for the completeness of the cluster catalog",
    "this would also lead to an overestimate of type 2 gmcs relative to type 3 gmcs .    in order to make a quantitative comparison between our models and the evolutionary classification of @xcite",
    ", we employ a few simple prescriptions to generate synthetic @xmath279 band , h@xmath265 , and radio continuum photometry for the clusters and h  ii regions in our simulated clouds .",
    "first , we calculate the @xmath279-band luminosity of our simulated clusters using the synthetic photometry of @xcite . for @xmath280 ,",
    "the photometry is based on the evolution tracks of @xcite . for massive stars , @xmath281 ,",
    "the synthetic photometry is based on the high mass - loss models of @xcite . for both sets of synthetic photometry",
    ", we assume @xmath282 .",
    "following @xcite , we approximate variations in @xmath283 for these stars by only considering the main sequence evolution and taking @xmath284 , the mean luminosity on the main sequence . since the stellar evolutionary tracks give the luminosity at a discrete set of masses , we interpolate by fitting a broken power law between stellar masses with evolutionary tracks .",
    "we calculate the h@xmath265 luminosity of our model h  ii regions via @xcite , @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the ionizing luminosity of the central star cluster in units of @xmath287 .",
    "this is larger than the empirical relation by a factor of @xmath288 to correct for the absorption of ionizing radiation by dust grains .",
    "lastly , we find the radio continuum luminosity of our simulated h  ii regions via @xcite , @xmath289 we also account for the reduction in flux from gmcs that would be larger than the beam size used by @xcite by performing a geometric correction and assuming that all h  ii regions are placed at the center of the model beam .",
    "to assign our simulated gmcs an evolutionary classification , we extract the ionizing luminosity and @xmath279 band luminosity of the brightest cluster in the gmc as a function of time . using the ionizing flux",
    ", we calculate the expected h@xmath265 and radio continuum luminosity via equations  ( [ halphalum ] ) and  ( [ radiolum ] ) respectively . for the @xmath279 band and @xmath290 luminosity",
    ", we correct for the foreground extinction , @xmath291 , towards the lmc @xcite , ignoring extinction internal to the lmc but external to the cloud under consideration .",
    "to identify the gmc as either type 2 or type 3 , we use either an h@xmath265 luminosity cutoff or a radio continuum flux cutoff corresponding to the detection limits quoted by @xcite . for h@xmath265",
    ", we say that an h  ii region is detected if @xmath292 . for radio continuum",
    ", we say an h  ii region is detected if the radio flux at a distance of @xmath293 would be greater than @xmath294 for a beam size of 20@xmath295 at @xmath296 @xcite .",
    "finally , we say that a gmc is type 3 if it meets the criteria just described for h@xmath265 or radio continuum as well as if @xmath297 , the completeness limit quoted by @xcite for the young cluster sample .",
    "since there are bound to be clusters that are located both behind and within clouds along our line of sight , we also correct the synthetic @xmath279-band and h@xmath265 photometry for extinction by the gmc .",
    "this is done by assuming that star clusters form at random locations within clouds .",
    "we calculate the optical depth to the star cluster via @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the mean dust opacity through the cloud , @xmath300 is the depth into the cloud in units of the cloud radius and @xmath301 is the angle between the normal to the surface of the cloud and the line of sight @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we use a milky way extinction curve and assume an lmc dust - to - gas ratio whereby a column of @xmath177 corresponds to @xmath302 . in the visual passbands we are concerned with here , the milky way and lmc extinction curves are nearly identical .",
    "we have run a set of 2000 cloud models , 1000 each evolved using two different values of the ambient surface density , @xmath303 .",
    "all other parameters are as in table  [ cloudparamtable ] .",
    "the resulting cloud models encompass the entire observed range in cloud masses reported by @xcite .    to directly compare to the observed distribution of gmc types we perform simulated observations using a monte carlo scheme .",
    "since the observations are inherently weighted by the gmc mass function , we first generate cloud masses by drawing from a powerlaw gmc mass spectrum with a slope of -1.6 , a minimum mass of @xmath304 and a maximum mass of @xmath305 @xcite .",
    "once a mass is generated , we find all time steps where model clouds have masses within 0.1 dex of the randomly selected mass . within this sample of time steps ,",
    "we calculate @xmath306 , @xmath307 , and @xmath308 , the fraction of type 1 , type 2 , and type 3 gmcs , respectively . at the same time , we calculate @xmath309 , @xmath310 , and @xmath311 the average age of clouds in each gmc type bin .",
    "we generate @xmath312 monte carlo realizations , from which we construct probability distributions for @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 , and @xmath311 .",
    "the results of this comparison are presented in the top row of figure  [ typecompare ] . in the figure ,",
    "the lines connect the median of the monte carlo probability distributions while the error bars encompass the 10th and 90th percentile .",
    "we are able to reproduce the observed distribution of type 1 , 2 and 3 gmcs as observed by @xcite . in particular , using both detection limits , we find that the majority of clouds are detected as type 2 gmcs , and relatively fewer clouds are detected as type 1 and 3 gmcs .",
    "interestingly , in the bottom panel of the figure , we find that , on average , the gmc classification scheme does constitute an age sequence in that type 2 gmcs tend to be somewhat older than type 1 clouds .",
    "type 3 gmcs in turn tend to be older than type 2 clouds .",
    "on the other hand , the spread in cloud ages within each bin is well within the error bars , indicating that the gmc type classification is not necessarily a strict evolutionary sequence : older clouds can be classified as type 1 and younger clouds can be classified as type 3 .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  [ typehistory ] , where we plot the classification of a selection of gmcs as a function of time .",
    "we see that for some clouds , the classification scheme does represent an evolutionary sequence . in these runs ,",
    "thw cloud starts as a type 1 gmc , begins forming star clusters , evolves into a type 2 gmc , and then forms massive ob association and becomes a type 3 gmc .",
    "however , we also see that a cloud can quickly form a massive ob association and be classified as a type 3 gmc early on and only later be classified as a type 2 gmc .",
    "alternatively , a cloud may happen to not form any massive clusters late in its evolution , causing a massive and old cloud to be identified as a type 2 or 1 gmc late in its evolution .",
    "finally , there are clouds which exhibit no discernible pattern in their histories , more or less randomly transitioning between gmc classifications throughout their lives .",
    "this may explain the presence of massive ( @xmath149 ) type 1  young \" gmcs in the samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assuming that clouds evolve homologously is the main limitation of our model .",
    "we make the assumption of homology to significantly simplify the equations governing the evolution of the cloud .",
    "given the assumption of homology , our equations of motion follow rigorously from the local equation of momentum and energy conservation .",
    "a more complex cloud structure destroys the relative simplicity of the model and would require computationally expensive hydrodynamical simulations to model accretion in detail .",
    "homology constrains the cloud to always maintain the same shape and degree of central concentration .",
    "this is equivalent to setting time derivates of the structure constant , @xmath313 , to zero .",
    "this might be a problem if changes of the moment of inertia of clouds occur primarily by changing the shape of the cloud rather than through overall expansion or contraction .",
    "it might also be a problem if the accretion flow does not in reality differentially mix with the cloud . if the accretion flow is anisotropic or if it can not fall to the central regions of the cloud before it mixes , the cloud may become less centrally condensed and we may overestimate the kinetic energy injection since material can not fall to the bottom of the cloud potential well .    while we can not resolve the dynamical effect of changes in the shape of the cloud , we can resolve changes in the size of the cloud . given the observed larson scaling relations , we expect more massive clouds to be larger , implying that clouds must expand as they accrete mass .",
    "if clouds do form via gravitational instability , they must accrete significant mass .",
    "we do resolve this behavior in our models .",
    "we caution that our virial analysis most readily describes a relaxed system .",
    "we may be doing a poor job of resolving phenomena that occur on a timescale comparable to the crossing time .",
    "one key assumption we made in deriving the global energy equation was that the atomic envelope contributes negligibly to the total magnetic energy associated with the cloud .",
    "that is , we did not include the magnetic field when calculating @xmath314 in equation  ( [ eambdef ] ) .",
    "the motivation for this assumption is based on comparisons of observations of magnetic fields in dense molecular clumps , where it is possible to measure the magnetic field directly via the zeeman effect in lines of oh and cn @xcite , to the magnetic fields in the atomic ism , measured via the zeeman effect in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "these studies consistently find that the magnetic field strength is significantly elevated in the dense molecular gas .",
    "however , most of the volume of a gmc is occupied by diffuse molecular gas with low oh abundance  frustrating efforts to measure magnetic fields via observations of oh in emission .",
    "thus , without direct observations of magnetic fields in the diffuse molecular gas , we can not know whether the magnetic fields in the atomic envelope are weak or strong compared to the magnetic field strength in the bulk of a gmc . while preliminary observations by troland et al .",
    "( 2011 , private communication ) indicate that magnetic fields in the diffuse molecular component are somewhat stronger than in the atomic envelope , this question has yet to be settled .",
    "it is possible that we underestimate the net magnetic energy due to the presence of the cloud .",
    "another possible problem with our treatment of magnetic fields is that we assume the mass - to - flux ratio remains constant throughout the evolution of the cloud .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming a fixed value for @xmath187",
    ". this assumption might be invalid if accreted material flows preferentially along magnetic field lines or if ambipolar diffusion can act act on timescales comparable to the cloud dynamical time . while measurements @xcite and theoretical esimates @xcite of the mass - to - flux ratio of molecular clouds find that clouds should be marginally supercritical , with mass - to - flux ratios of order unity , the time - evolution and cloud - to - cloud variation in mass - to - flux ratios are poorly constrained .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed constancy of gmc surface densities is an artifact ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". since the physical structure we assume for the clouds in our model implicitly assumes that the larson relations are valid , this may imply that our models do not correspond well to real gmcs .",
    "the argument that the larson laws are a product of a selection effect usually proceeds as follows .",
    "if one looks for overdensities of a particular size in a simulation of the turbulent ism , one will find that the selected clouds have a wide distribution of masses , implying a large spread in cloud - to - cloud surface density .",
    "since observers detect clouds using co as a tracer and at low surface density the co abundance is not high enough to be detectable in emission , observers will never find low surface density clouds .",
    "this implies that at a fixed radius , real clouds should have more variation in mass than a naive interpretation of the co observations would suggest .",
    "this argument misses two key aspects of the observed properties of gmcs .",
    "the first is that it can not explain the lack of clouds at _ high _ gas surface densities .",
    "for the same reason that we should not be able to see diffuse clouds , we should very easily be able to see compact , high surface density co clouds .",
    "the fact that these clouds do nt exist implies something important about molecular cloud structure .",
    "the second argument is that the lack of low surface density clouds does not imply that molecular clouds can exist at all surface densities but merely that the molecular clouds dissociate once they become optically thin to the ambient ultraviolet radiation field . while diffuse atomic clouds certainly exist , these clouds do not form stars @xcite .    since high surface density gmcs",
    "are not observed in the local universe and low surface density clouds are not molecular and thus not gmcs by definition , the observed lack of variation in gmc surface densities must be a real property of the clouds . this has been confirmed with very detailed dust extinction measurements of nearby star forming clouds , where an exquisitely tight mass - radius relation is observed @xcite and in extragalactic studies where little variation is seen when comparing the mass - radius relation from galaxy to galaxy @xcite .",
    "taken together , the evidence seems to imply that the larson relations are a property of the structure of gmcs and are not due to a selection effect .",
    "in this paper , we have presented semianalytic dynamical models for the evolution of giant molecular clouds undergoing both mass accretion and star formation . these models are able to capture the evolution of individual gmcs from their growth and the onset of massive star formation , until their dispersal via an energetic h  ii region or through the combined action of accretion and star formation .",
    "we are able for the first time to synthesize galactic populations of gmcs whose properties correspond closely to the observed properties of gmcs in the milky way and nearby external galaxies .",
    "we have shown that clouds in low surface density environments generally disperse within a few crossing times , before they can accrete all of the gas in their reservoir . at the same time , clouds in high surface density environments do accrete all of the gas in their reservoirs and tend to be larger and more massive .",
    "we have also shown that mass accretion can contribute a significant fraction of the total energy available for turbulent driving .",
    "lastly , we generate synthetic cluster observations and compare against the evolutionary classification scheme of @xcite , finding good agreement when we correct for selection effects and systematic biases inherent in the observations .",
    "we conclude that , on average , the evolutionary classification scheme corresponds to an age sequence but is not a good predictor for the evolutionary state of isolated clouds .",
    "we would like to thank leo blitz and adam leroy for making available the milky way data used in figures  [ blitzplot ] and  [ blitzplot_lw ] .",

    "the dimensionless variables @xmath338 are defined explicitly in appendix  [ accretionappendix ] .    the magnetic term @xmath31 retains the form used in paper i and derived by @xcite because we assume any deformation of the magnetic field in the ambient medium caused by the presence of the cloud is negligible at the virial surface , allowing us to approximate that the virial volume is threaded by a constant magnetic field @xmath339 .",

    "for this reason , we reject as unphysical any portion of cloud history with @xmath377 . in practice , we find @xmath378 for the lifetime of all clouds we simulate .",
    "here we derive the global equation of energy conservation for a cloud undergoing accretion and star formation .",
    "we begin by writing the equation of momentum conservation ( equation  [ [ momeq ] ] ) in lagrangian form ,              where @xmath384 is the internal energy per unit mass and @xmath385 and @xmath386 are respectively the rates of energy gain and loss per unit volume . here",
    "we ve assumed that accreted material has the same thermal energy density as cloud material , which will be true if the radiative timescales are short compared to the mechanical timescales , as in molecular cloud conditions .",

    "this is equivalent to the statement that turbulent kinetic energy is converted into heat at viscous scales whereupon the energy is quickly radiated away . while there may be other heating mechanisms , including cosmic rays and protostellar radiation , we neglect these sources by noting that any local heating should be offset in a time much shorter than the dynamical time",
    ".            we can integrate equation  ( [ energyevol ] ) over the virial volume and obtain an evolution equation for @xmath75 .",
    "portions of this calculation are performed explicitly in paper i and we do not reproduce those results here .",
    "the new terms stem from our inclusion of accretion as well as the inclusion of @xmath332 , the random component of the stellar forcing term .",
    "the integrals over the new terms are evaluated below .",
    "the random stellar forcing term can be evaluated by noting that @xmath393 and @xmath328 are assumed to be uncorrelated , so @xmath394 .",
    "this integral depends on the degree of correlation between two randomly oriented vectors , @xmath395 and @xmath328 . since , at a fixed time , the direction of expansion of an h  ii region is the same as the direction of momentum injection , these vectors should indeed be highly correlated .",
    "this term then corresponds to the net injection of energy by h  ii regions ,                we are left with one last integral on the right hand side of equation  ( [ accterm ] ) that depends on the correlation between two vector fields , @xmath395 and @xmath84 .",

    "now consider the limit @xmath402 .",
    "we approximate that a parcel of reservoir material mixes with the cloud once it has swept up a mass of cloud material equal to its own mass .",
    "since the interaction between cloud material and reservoir material must be inelastic if they are to mix , the velocity of cloud material must be driven by the act of mixing to @xmath405 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath403 , the reservoir material is driven to a velocity @xmath406 .",
    "we obtain the correct answer in all three limits if we assume @xmath407 this is an upper bound on the value of the integral in the limit of perfect correlation between @xmath395 and @xmath84 .",
