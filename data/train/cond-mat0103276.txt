    "much attention has been paid in recent years to the hard core yukawa ( hcy ) potential as a model for the pair interactions of fluids @xcite .",
    "interest in the potential is motivated on the one hand by its relevance to solvent averaged interactions in polyelectrolytic and colloidal particles and , on the other hand , by its analytical tractability in the context of liquid state theories such as the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) and the self consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) .",
    "recent studies of the hcy fluid can be found in @xcite and references therein .    for simple fluids interacting via dispersion forces",
    ", however , the bare hcy potential fails to provide a realistic representation of the interactions , which are much better modelled by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential . unfortunately owing to its mathematical structure ,",
    "the latter is less amenable to direct study by the msa and scoza than is the hcy potential .",
    "nevertheless , it has long been appreciated that a lj - like simple - fluid potential can be replaced by a potential with a hard core plus a linear combination of _ two _ yukawa tails @xcite with no appreciable loss of agreement between the experimental and model equations of state .",
    "such a potential permits the theoretical study of simple fluids whilst retaining the convenient mathematical properties of the hcy potential .",
    "several different representations of a lj - like fluid in terms of a hard - core plus two yukawa fluid ( hc2yf ) have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the one we use here is very similar to that recently given by kalyuzhnyi and cummings @xcite : @xmath0- \\displaystyle{\\frac{a_{2}\\epsilon}{r}}\\exp[-z_{2}(r-\\sigma ) ] \\hspace*{1 cm } & r > \\sigma \\ , .",

    "( [ eq : cumpot ] ) differs slightly from the original parameterisation by kalyuzhnyi and cummings insomuch as these authors determined the hard - sphere diameter @xmath7 as a function of temperature via the barker - henderson procedure  @xcite in order to represent the soft - core repulsive interaction which results from the weeks - chandler - henderson separation of the lj potential  @xcite .",

    "we extend the work of kalyuzhnyi and cummings @xcite by determining the liquid - gas phase behaviour of the hc2yf using the scoza of hye and stell . unlike those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , this theory is neither mean - field nor mean - spherical like and on the basis of a similar study already performed for the hcy fluid , it can be expected to give a superior account of fluid properties in the near - critical regime .",
    "we compare the predictions of the scoza for the the critical point and the coexistence curve to those obtained by other approaches , including the renormalization - group based hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) of parola and reatto @xcite , and to new high resolution simulation results for the hc2yf .",
    "we find that one version of the scoza considered provides a remarkably accurate critical point and coexistence curve . the critical density and temperature predicted by the theory agree with the simulation results to within 1% .",

    "( [ eq : cumpot ] ) , consist of a singular hard - sphere repulsion with diameter @xmath1 and a longer - ranged tail @xmath9 .",

    "a closed theory is obtained by supplementing the oz equation with an approximate relation involving @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in its simplest form ,",
    "the scoza amounts to setting : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of the system , @xmath14 is the inverse temperature , and the hard - sphere diameter has been set equal to one .",
    "this closure resembles that adopted in the msa , except that the amplitude @xmath15 of the direct correlation function outside the repulsive core is regarded as an unknown state - dependent quantity , to be determined in such a way that consistency between the compressibility and the energy route to thermodynamics is enforced .",
    "this constraint amounts to requiring that the reduced compressibility @xmath16 and the excess internal energy per unit volume @xmath17 satisfy the condition : @xmath18 where it is understood that @xmath16 is obtained by the compressibility sum rule as the structure factor @xmath19 evaluated at @xmath20 , while @xmath17 is obtained by the energy equation as the spatial integral of the tail interaction @xmath9 weighted by the radial distribution function @xmath10 . if the closure  ( [ closure ] ) is used for the correlations , the consistency condition  ( [ consist ] ) yields a closed partial differential equation ( pde ) for the function @xmath21 . in the present case , implementing this scheme is made simpler by taking advantage of the analytical results obtained for the oz equation with the closure  ( [ closure ] ) when the tail potential @xmath9 has a two - yukawa form like that of eq .",

    "<S> we study a model for an argon - like fluid parameterised in terms of a hard - core repulsion and a two - yukawa potential . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid - gas phase behaviour of the model is obtained from the thermodynamically self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) of hye and stell , the solution of which lends itself particularly well to a pair potential of this form . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for the critical point and the coexistence curve are compared to new high resolution simulation data and to other liquid - state theories , including the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) of parola and reatto . </S>",
    "<S> both scoza and hrt deliver results that are considerably more accurate than standard integral - equation approaches . among the versions of scoza </S>",
