    "miras are long period variable stars lying on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of the hr diagram with periods in the range 100 to 700 days .",
    "their masses lie between 0.5@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 , and their k band mean absolute magnitudes lie in the range @xmath1 ( c.f .",
    "wood 1995 ) .",
    "whitelock ( 1995 ) reviews a number of reasons for the astrophysical importance of mira variables , highlighting in particular their suitability as distance indicators  a fact which makes them useful tracers of galactic structure .",
    "the use of miras as distance estimators relies upon the existence of period - luminosity ( pl ) and period - luminosity - colour ( plc ) relations at mean light , which may be calibrated with nearby stars whose distance is otherwise known and then applied to more remote objects to estimate their distance . in e.g. feast et al .",
    "( 1989 , hereafter f89 ) pl and plc relations were derived for a calibrating sample of about 50 oxygen - rich ( o ) and carbon - rich ( c ) miras in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , using time - averaged mean j , h , k and bolometric magnitudes . f89 found that the o miras displayed a well - defined relations in the k band , and also based on j , h and bolometric magnitudes , but with a larger dispersion in these latter three cases . for the c miras",
    "f89 confirmed the existence of a pl relation in the k band .",
    "these derived relations were then applied to determine distance moduli to a number of galactic globular clusters .    in this paper , using the same calibrating sample of lmc miras as in f89 we investigate the evidence for pl and plc relations at maximum light . the primary motivation for",
    "this work comes from kanbur & hendry ( 1996 , hereafter kh ) , who derived v band pl and plc relations at maximum light for a sample of cepheids in the lmc , previously published in martin , warren & feast ( 1979 ) .",
    "kh outlined specific physical reasons why the use of cepheid maximum light relations might be preferable to those at mean light , developing the earlier theoretical work of simon , kanbur & mihalas ( 1993 ) . in a similar manner , in this paper we derive maximum light pl and plc relations for mira variables and discuss a possible physical justification for their existence .",
    "in particular we consider a physical explanation for the smaller observed dispersion of maximum light relations when compared with the corresponding relations at mean light .",
    "for completeness we also consider pl and plc relations at minimum light and compare them with their counterparts and mean and maximum light .    a number of authors ( c.f .",
    "sandage 1958 , madore & freedman 1991 , kh ) have discussed the theoretical justification for the existence of a pl and plc relation for cepheid variables , deriving the so - called _ pulsation equation _",
    ", @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the period , total mass , equilibrium luminosity and effective temperature respectively of the star and @xmath7 is a slowly varying function of stellar parameters .",
    "cepheids occupy an instability strip of finite width in the hr diagram .",
    "if a similar situation holds for miras ( feast 1989 , wood 1990 , shibahashi 1993 ) , then this equation can be used to explain the existence of pl and plc relations for both miras and cepheids since it assumes only the period ",
    "mean density theorem and the stefan  boltzmann law .",
    "mira and cepheid pl relations arise from the collapse of equation ( 1 ) over the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the case of miras , however , the equilibrium luminosity is a strong function of the core mass ( shibahashi 1993 ) . assuming that the equilibrium luminosity is close to the mean luminosity over a pulsational cycle , both the range of core masses and total masses therefore contribute to the scatter in a pl relation at mean light for a mira of a given period .",
    "we discuss the effect of metallicity on the scatter of the pl relation in section 4 below .",
    "if it is the case that @xmath10 that is , the equilibrium photospheric radius of the star is approximately equal to the photospheric radius at _ maximum _ light , then , following essentially the same reasoning as in kh , we can use the period ",
    "mean density theorem and the stefan  boltzmann law to write @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the luminosity and temperature at maximum light . in the case of cepheids , cox ( 1974 )",
    "provides good evidence that equation ( 2 ) is a reasonable assumption .",
    "support for the validity of equation ( 2 ) in the case of mira variables is given in wood ( 1995 ) and references therein .",
    "assuming equation ( 2 ) to be valid for miras , equation ( 3 ) can then be used to justify theoretically the existence of pl and plc relations at _ maximum _ light for these stars , as a result of collapsing equation ( 3 ) over the variables @xmath8 and @xmath14 .    in the cepheid case ,",
    "simon , kanbur & mihalas ( 1993 ) showed that at maximum light the range of photospheric temperatures is significantly smaller than the range of effective temperatures at mean light .",
    "motivated by this work kh suggested that cepheid pl and plc relations at maximum light could have significantly smaller dispersion than at mean light  a result which was investigated in detail in kh . a similar effect may not be present for mira variables , but another advantage of the use of maximum light is nonetheless apparent for miras .",
    "their pulsations , like cepheids , are envelope phenomena  energy modulation and amplitude limitation occurring in the outer envelope .",
    "the maximum luminosity depends on the envelope mass as well as the core mass . in equation",
    "( 2 ) , on the other hand , the equilibrium luminosity is strongly dependent on the core mass ( shibahashi 1993 )",
    ". thus the quantities @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in equation ( 1 ) have dependencies on both the envelope and core mass , whereas @xmath5 is dependent strongly on the core mass .",
    "all the quantities in equation ( 3 ) have dependencies on the core and enevlope mass .",
    "we conjecture that , even if the range of @xmath15 were no different to the range of @xmath16 , this situation could lead to mira pl and plc relations at maximum light to have smaller dispersion than rheir counterparts at mean light .",
    "further work is needed to examine this proposition .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the lmc calibrating data , and the methods used to derive pl and plc relations and evaluate their statistical significance . in sections 3 and 4 we present our results for pl and plc relations respectively , which are then discussed further and compared with those of f89 in section 5 , highlighting some important consequences for the use of miras as probes of galactic structure .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present our conclusions and possibilities for further study .",
    "the data used in this study were taken from glass et al ( 1990 ) , which was also the primary reference for the analysis of f89 . these data consisted of multi - epoch observations at a number of wavelengths of a large sample of o and c miras in the lmc .",
    "o miras are oxygen - rich objects whilst c miras are carbon - rich ; the classification of each star as a c or o mira can be made from spectral type ( if known ) or from colour measurements and we adopt the same classifications as those published in f89 .",
    "in addition we adopt the mira periods as given in glass et al ( 1990 ) ; since the average number of epochs of observation for each star in the glass et al .",
    "study was more than eleven , with good phase coverage , it is unlikely that the published periods are subject to any significant uncertainty .",
    "the data for the o and c miras are summarised in tables 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "these tables list the star name , its period , taken from glass et al ( 1990 ) , and the mean , maximum and minimum magnitudes at j , h , k and bolometric wavebands .",
    "all magnitudes in tables 1 and 2 have been corrected for extinction following f89 , assuming @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we adopted as the maximum and minimum magnitude simply the maximum and minimum _ observed _ value ( or interpolated value in the case of bolometric magnitude ) reported in glass et al ( 1990 ) .",
    "mean magnitudes were calculated as the average of the maximum and minimum observed ( interpolated ) magnitudes , which was also the definition of mean magnitude adopted for the relations derived in f89 .",
    "multi - epoch observations were available in glass et al .",

    "as will be clear from figures 1 to 6 in section 4 , in most cases the existence of a tightly correlated pl relation at mean and maximum light was immediately evident from a scatterplot of apparent magnitude against log period .",
    "notwithstanding this , we considered it instructive  particularly for the more marginal pl relations  to determine quantitatively the statistical significance of including a log period term in each of our regression fits . in order to do this",
    "we applied the same statistical test which was introduced in kh , and which is described in detail in the appendix of that paper , involving the partial multiple correlation coefficient , @xmath26 , of the regression ( c.f .",
    "graybill 1976 ) .",
    "if @xmath26 equals zero then the log period term makes no contribution to a reduction in the dispersion of the fit and is effectively redundant . for each regression we computed the sample value of @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath27 . under the null hypothesis that the true value of @xmath26 is equal to zero",
    "then @xmath28 has an f distribution ( c.f .",
    "we also carried out fits to plc relations of the form @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes dereddened colour , and also to the corresponding equations for @xmath33 colour .",
    "we defined maximum and minimum colour as the colour at the phase at which respectively the maximum and minimum magnitude was observed .",
    "we applied the same statistical test as for the pl relations to determine the significance of adding the colour term in each plc relation .",
    "we compared the fitted relations obtained using mean , maximum and minimum magnitudes as defined above with those derived using magnitudes calculated from a first order fourier fit to the light curve of each mira . in all cases we found no significant difference in the slopes , zero points and dispersions of the fitted relations at either maximum or mean light .",
    "the same conclusion regarding the robustness of mean magnitudes was reached in f89 , where mean values obtained from averaging the maximum and minimum magnitudes were compared with the average of maximum and minimum intensities and also with the results of fourier fits to both magnitudes and intensities .",
    "the robustness of mean and maximum pl relations to the choice of definition for mean and maximum light is in complete accordance with the results of hendry , kanbur & clarke ( 1997 , in prep . ) , in which we investigate the statistical properties of various different estimators of mean and maximum light  including those adopted here and those derived from fitting low order fourier series  as a function of number of sampled phase points , phase coverage , light curve shape and limiting magnitude .",
    "the results of our regression fits to equations 4 , 5 and 6 are presented in tables 3 to 6 and illustrated in figures 1 to 6 .",

    "the principal result of this paper concerns the existence of mira pl relations at maximum light and the fact that in all cases these relations display less scatter than the corresponding mean light relations , a reduction in dispersion which is statistically significant in the j and h bands . this result is apparent not only in the values of the dispersion derived for the mean and maximum light relations , but also is suggested by the behaviour of some of the outliers in the scatterplots of magnitude against log period . in figures 3 and 4 for example , there are a small number of outliers , with log periods of around 2.5 , in the j and h band mean light relations which are in much better agreement with the fitted regression line at maximum light .",
    "we also find that in several cases for the c miras the dispersion of the maximum light plc relation is significantly smaller , by up to 50% , than at mean light .",
    "it is obviously important now to ask what is the most likely source of the reduction in dispersion which we have observed at maximum light . figures 7 and 8 show plots of dereddened @xmath32 colour against log period at mean ( a ) and maximum ( b ) light , for the c and o miras respectively .",
    "( note that ` maximum @xmath41 ' , as indicated on the axes of the plots in figures 7 and 8 , in fact means the dereddened colour at the phase of maximum light in the j band , which need not be the same as the maximum observed value of j - k colour , although the difference is likely to be quite small ) .",
    "similarly figures 9 and 10 show plots of dereddened @xmath33 colour against log period for the c and o miras respectively .",
    "whilst the properties of mira plc relations at maximum light will be the focus of future work , we note from these plots that the scatter in @xmath41 at a given period is very similar at mean and maximum light .",
    "this suggests that the range of effective temperatures at given period will not be greatly different at mean and maximum light , as was also claimed by feast ( 1995 ) . in the light of our discussion in section 1",
    ", we therefore conjecture that the smaller dispersion of maximum light pl relations compared with mean pl relations is primarily due to the fact that both maximum luminosity and period depend on the total mass , whereas equilibrium luminosity  and hence mean luminosity  depends strongly on core mass . if the above explanation is correct then",
    " insofar as a considerably larger reduction in dispersion is found in the j and h bands for the c miras compared with the o miras ",
    "one might suppose this to be due to there being a larger difference between the range of core masses and total masses for c miras compared with that for o miras . it would be interesting to investigate this possibility further , and carry out a more detailed study of the systematic differences between c and o miras",
    ".    in comparing the values of the regression coefficients obtained in the pl fits at mean and maximum light , the general trend which one observes is as follows . for the c miras the zero point , @xmath25 , and slope , @xmath24 , are found to be smaller and more shallow ( i.e. less negative ) respectively for the maximum light relations in all wavebands .",
    "based on the standard errors of the regression coefficients this systematic difference appears to be quite significant , although we have not carried out a specific statistical test of this hypothesis . for the o miras , on the other hand ,",
    "precisely the converse is the case : the zero point and slope of the pl relations at maximum light are found to be respectively larger and steeper ( i.e. more negative ) than at mean light in all wavebands . aside from investigating whether the use of the maximum light relations derived in this study lead to distance estimates significantly different from those determined using mira pl relations at mean light ( c.f .",
    "f89 , whitelock 1995 , feast 1995 ) , it would be interesting to investigate if any systematic difference in the slope and zero point of maximum light relations can be explained in terms of our existing knowledge of the physics of mira variables .",
    "we will address this problem further in a future paper .",
    "in the case of cepheids it was shown in simon , kanbur & mihalas ( 1993 ) that _ both _ maximum and minimum light occur as the star is passing through its equilibrium radius .",
    "if this were also true for miras , then equation ( 3 ) might also be valid at minimum light , but with @xmath12 and @xmath13 replaced by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "as we commented above , the mira pl and plc relations at minimum light were in all cases found to have a larger dispersion than at mean light . in view of our discussion in section 1 ,",
    "perhaps one reason for this result is that minimum luminosity is dependent on the total mass of the star in a different way to maximum luminosity ; in other words it may be the case that equation ( 3 )  in its equivalent form  does indeed hold at minimum light but that when we collapse the equation over the variables @xmath8 and @xmath44 the resultant pl relation has a larger dispersion than at either maximum or mean light .",
    "we intend to investigate further the properties of pl relations at minimum light in future work .",
    "whilst the mean and maximum light pl relations which we have derived here clearly have practical use in terms of in terms of distance estimation , the relations involving bolometric magnitudes are also very interesting for the purpose of better understanding stellar pulsation and evolution .",
    "indeed , the fact that we have established bolometric pl relations for both c and o miras directly supports the validity of equation ( 3 ) .",
    "finally it is important to comment explicitly on the practical application of the results of this paper  the use of maximum light pl relations for miras as distance indicators . aside from the advantage of the small reduction in dispersion which our analysis in this paper has identified , the use of maximum light relations in distance estimation can also be justified on the grounds that one can extend their application to greater distances before the effects of luminosity selection bias become important . in hendry , kanbur & clarke ( 1997 , in prep . )",
    "we examine in detail the robustness of pl relations derived for miras detected close to an apparent magnitude limit , and find that  as one approaches the magnitude limit  the measurement of mean light becomes biased , and is subject to a increasingly large root mean squared error , substantially more quickly than does maximum light .",
    "moreover , for a range of different light curve shapes we find that the identification of maximum light simply with the brightest observed phase point ( as was the definition adopted in this paper ) remains a robust and reliable estimate of maximum light as one approaches the magnitude limit ",
    "provided one has of the order of ten or more sampled phase points  and is certainly considerably more robust than the identification of mean light with the average of the observed magnitudes .",
    "this work suggests that maximum light pl relations can easily be constructed without recourse to exhaustive observing programmes and can therefore prove useful in extending the range and reliability of mira - based distance indicators .",
    "it would seem to us , therefore , that a priority for future work is to establish the existence of mira pl relations at maximum light in different stellar environments , such as the smc and galactic globular clusters , and to test the uniformity of such relations .",
    "wood ( 1990 ) has used equations for the position of agb in the hr diagram together with the period - mean density theorem to obtain a pulsation equation similar to equation ( 1 ) , but also incorporating a metallicity dependence .",
    "this work is discussed in feast ( 1995 ) , which suggests that the available evidence indicates little variation in the mean light mira pl relations at k or bolometric magnitudes in environments with a range of different metallicities .",
    "there is no reason to believe why any metallicity dependence of equation ( 1 ) would act differentially between mean and maximum light , although of course any possible effect should certainly be checked observationally . in any case , such a metallicity gradient with environment  if present ",
    "would have no bearing on our discussion of the relative dispersion of mean and maximum light pl relations in this paper .",
    "some examples of the recent application of distance indicators based on mira pl relations at mean light include the following . in f89 mira distances",
    "were determined to galactic globular clusters , thus providing an absolute calibration of rr lyrae and horizontal branch stars .",
    "on the other hand , whitelock ( 1995 ) and references therein used mira pl relations at mean light to study the dimensions and kinematics of the disk , halo and bulge of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated the existence of pl relations for miras at maximum light in the j , h and ik bands and for bolometric magnitudes .",
    "our results were based on analysis of a sample of oxygen - rich and carbon - rich miras in the lmc , as previously studied in f89 . in the j ,",
    "h and k bands the pl relations at maximum light have a smaller dispersion for the oxygen - rich miras than for the carbon rich miras , while the converse was found to be true for the pl relation based on bolometric magnitudes .",
    "we have shown that for the j and h bands the mira pl relations at maximum light have a significantly smaller dispersion than their counterparts at mean light .",
    "our results also are suggestive that c miras with periods in excess of 250 days have constant mean and maximum absolute magnitude .",
    "based on similar reasoning to that outlined in kh , we present a theoretical justification for the existence of such maximum light relations .",
    "the crucial assumption made in this justification is that the photospheric radius at mean light is roughly equal to the photospheric radius at maximum light , for which there exists some evidence . amongst other factors  including metallicity and temperature  the dispersion at given period in a mean light pl relation is influenced by both the range of core masses and the range of total masses found in miras .",
    "however , at maximum light we suggest that  amongst these same other factors  the dispersion at given period is influenced only by the range of total masses , and that it is this fact which is responsible for the smaller dispersion of maximum light pl relations which we have observed .    in section 5",
    "we have outlined a number of topics for future work , but in summary it seems clear that the main direction of future work should be the study of larger samples of miras , in order to investigate the prevalence , uniformity and reliability of maximum light relations in other environments .",
    "the relative robustness of maximum light relations when the corresponding mean light relations are pushed close to an apparent magnitude limit makes their application in external galaxies an important and exciting possibility  particularly with the installation of j and h band filters in the nicmos camera on the newly refurbished hubble space telescope .",
    "we are confident that mira pl relations at maximum light can become a powerful tool for galactic and extragalactic astronomy .",
