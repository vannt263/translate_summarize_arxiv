    "measurement of sparticle properties may provide clues about physics at energy scales that would be inaccessible to experiments in the foreseeable future .",
    "most early phenomenological analyses have been done within the framework of the msugra model or the msugra - motivated mssm ( where _ ad hoc _ relations between ssb parameters were assumed ) . in the last few years",

    "the good thing is that some of these assumptions will be directly testable if sparticles are discovered and their properties are measured  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems worthwhile to look at other viable alternatives for physics at energy scales much beyond the weak scale , with a view to see if there are direct ramifications for sparticle signals in future experiments .",
    "a serious study of this would entail susy simulation at colliders in a wide variety of models with features different from the msugra paradigm , which is characterized by universality of ssb parameters at a scale @xmath564 .",
    "our study represents a first step in this direction . here",
    ", we have surveyed a number of proposals for high scale physics that lead to non - universality of the ssb parameters in the mssm , which we regard as the effective theory at a sufficently low mass scale . these range from relatively minor modifications of the msugra @xmath0 gut model , where , _",
    "e.g. _ unification of scalar masses and @xmath12-parameters is assumed to occur at @xmath81 ( so that rg evolution induces some non - universality at @xmath48 ) , to major modifications involving conceptually new ideas for high scale physics ( new hypercolour interactions , string physics ) or the mediation of susy breaking to the observable sector ( anomaly mediated susy breaking , gaugino mediated susy breaking ) .",
    "other proposals that fall somewhat between these two extremes include models with larger unifying groups that naturally have additional non - universal contributions to scalar masses , or models where special boundary conditions on ssb parameters lead to unusual rg evolution and non - degeneracy of sparticle masses .",
    "for each of these scenarios , we have outlined the underlying physical ideas , delineated the parameter space in terms of which susy phenomenology might be analyzed , and discussed susy event generation using the simulation program isajet  @xcite .",
    "a variety of improvements to the isajet program have been made to allow event generation in the models discussed in this paper .",
    "these improvements are characterized by isajet keyword inputs , including @xmath38 for non - universal masses , @xmath183 for models with a right - handed neutrino contribution , such as @xmath1 , @xmath40 for user choice as to when the mssm becomes valid , and @xmath364 for anomaly - mediated susy breaking models . where possible , we present sample spectra , and allude to the important phenomenological differences from the reference msugra framework .",
    "a detailed phenomenological analysis of each one of these scenarios is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "our hope though is that this study will facilitate and spur such analyses . except for unusual cases",
    "where extreme degeneracies between sparticle masses result @xcite , we do not expect the reach of various future facilities ( expressed in terms of physical sparticle masses ) to qualitatively differ between the various scenarios .",
    "however , a careful examination of these will help us assess what we can hope to learn about high scale physics if sparticles are discovered and their properties measured . careful examination of physical implications of a variety of viable alternatives for the underlying theory will also help increase our understanding of the sort of analyses that might be needed to discriminate between these . in view of the potential pay - off",
