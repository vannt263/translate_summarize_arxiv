    "despite the null results for direct searches of supersymmetric particles at the lhc  @xcite , models of supersymmetry ( susy ) remain among the most well - motivated and popular extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . besides direct searches , there exist numerous ways to indirectly probe susy models , _",
    "e.g. _ with low energy flavor observables , from dark matter direct detection results , and through higgs properties .",
    "the discovery of a new particle at the lhc with a mass of @xmath0  gev compatible with a sm - like higgs boson  @xcite has far reaching consequences for any model of new physics ( np ) with a non - standard higgs sector .",
    "indeed , the lhc higgs results have motivated numerous studies of their implications in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its variants  @xcite .",
    "a sm - like higgs with a mass of @xmath1  gev can be accommodated in the mssm as long as stops are either very heavy or strongly mixed .",
    "interestingly enough , large stop mixing unavoidably leads to irreducible contributions to low energy flavor observables , in particular in the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays @xmath2 and @xmath3 , even if all soft masses are flavor blind .",
    "correspondingly , rare @xmath4 decays can be used to set non - trivial constraints on mssm parameters .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss the status of the mssm , in view of the recent higgs search results from the lhc  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite , the recent strong limits on mssm higgs bosons in @xmath5 searches  @xcite and @xmath6 searches  @xcite , the latest results in @xmath4 physics , in particular the recent evidence for @xmath7 from lhcb  @xcite , the updated results on @xmath8 from belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite as well as on @xmath3 from babar  @xcite , and also the updated xenon100 bounds on dark matter direct detection  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the flavor structure of the susy particles is determined by the principle of minimal flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite , _ i.e. _ we will assume that the sm yukawa couplings are the only sources of flavor violation .",
    "this is motivated by the absence of any unambiguous deviation from sm expectations in flavor observables .",
    "we emphasize that even in this restrictive framework , flavor observables play an important role in constraining the viable parameter space of the mssm . indeed , flavor bounds can be stronger than bounds from direct searches for susy particles in various regions of parameter space .",
    "this is particularly true for large values of @xmath9 , where loop - induced flavor changing couplings of the heavy higgs bosons of the mssm give enhanced contributions to fcnc processes . in the mssm with large @xmath9",
    ", direct searches of the heavy higgs bosons also become especially sensitive and , moreover , the exchange of heavy higgs bosons can also lead to large dark matter direct detection cross sections , giving additional complementary means to probe this region of parameter space .    in the large @xmath9 regime , loop corrections to higgs ",
    "fermion couplings can be significant and it is mandatory to resum @xmath10enhanced terms to obtain reliable predictions for any observables that depend on these couplings in the mssm .",
    "we provide comprehensive analytical expressions for all the relevant loop - corrected higgs couplings , loop corrections to the sm - like higgs mass , higgs production and decay rates , contributions to flavor observables , and dark matter direct detection cross sections , consistently taking into account the most general structure of the soft susy breaking terms compatible with the mfv ansatz . in particular ,",
    "we include effects from the bottom yukawa coupling as well as the tau yukawa coupling , as they are relevant for large @xmath10 .",
    "this goes beyond the analyses in  @xcite , where bottom yukawa effects in the squark masses were neglected .",
    "we also give a detailed treatment of gaugino loop contributions to fcnc processes that can arise from a mass splitting between the left - handed squarks of the first two and the third generations .",
    "we highlight that in order to discuss the gaugino contributions to fcnc processes in the large @xmath11 regime , both the squark mass splitting and the alignment of this splitting with the quark yukawas must be considered .",
    "putting together all the relevant experimental constraints coming from current higgs , flavor and dark matter sectors on the mssm parameters , we point out regions of the mfv mssm parameter space where these constraints are minimized .",
    "we also discuss the robustness of these bounds and to which extent they can be avoided .",
    "we take a phenomenological approach and treat the mssm parameters as free parameters at the tev scale : however , we augment this discussion with a study of renormalization group equation ( rge ) effects , assuming minimal supergravity ( msugra)like boundary conditions at a high scale and monitoring the generic spectrum of susy particles and their mass splittings induced by the running .    in sec .",

    "i.e. _ the soft masses , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and trilinear couplings , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are possible sources of flavor violation .",
    "generic flavor violating entries in these matrices are strongly constrained by flavor physics data .",
    "a simple approach to address this `` susy flavor problem '' is the principle of minimal flavor violation  @xcite , which states that the sm yukawa couplings are the only sources of flavor violation even in extensions of the sm . in the context of the mssm",
    ", this implies that the soft terms can be expanded in powers of the yukawa couplings . in the super - cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( super - ckm ) basis , where squarks and quarks are simultaneously rotated to obtain diagonal yukawa couplings , the soft masses are  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the diagonal up and down quark yukawa matrices and",
    "@xmath22 is the ckm matrix .",
    "the soft mass @xmath23 enters the left - left block of the down squark mass matrix , while @xmath24 enters the up squark mass matrix .",
    "the generic structure in  ( [ eq : softmfv ] ) is always generated by rge running if flavor blind boundary conditions are assumed at a high scale  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 lead to splittings between the squark masses . to be specific , the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 generate a splitting between the masses of the first two and the third generations of right - handed up and down squarks , respectively , while the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 generate a splitting between the first two and the third generations of left - handed squarks . note that the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath27 only become important for large values of @xmath11 , where the bottom yukawa is @xmath31 . as we are particularly interested in the large @xmath11 regime , in the following we will take all the above masses as independent parameters and use @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the stop and sbottom masses and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for the masses of the first two generations , which are degenerate to an excellent approximation in this setup .",
    "this is analogous to the pmssm framework  @xcite frequently studied in the literature .",
    "we stress , however , that the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 also induce flavor violating entries in the left - handed squark mass matrices .",
    "these entries are proportional to small ckm angles and lead to controlled but non - negligible contributions to fcnc processes .",
    "in fact , due to @xmath35 invariance , the left - left blocks of the up and down squark mass matrices are related by a ckm rotation , and therefore _ any splitting _ in the diagonal entries of the left - handed soft masses @xmath23 unavoidably induces off - diagonal entries in the up or down squark mass matrices . moreover",
    ", distinct flavor phenomenology arises depending on which of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , or @xmath30 parameters is responsible for the splitting .",
    "in particular , a splitting induced by @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is aligned in the up- ( down- ) sector and will only lead to off - diagonal entries in the down ( up ) squark mass matrix .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 induces flavor violation in both the up and down squark masses matrices .",
    "all flavor observables that we will discuss in the following depend on the combination @xmath36 .",
    "we thus introduce one additional parameter @xmath37 which reflects the alignment of the splitting in the left - handed squark masses and hence parametrizes the fraction of the splitting in the masses leading to flavor violation in the down sector .",
    "we assume @xmath38 is real in the following . and @xmath29 have to be real due to hermiticity of the squark masses , @xmath30 can in principle be complex .",
    "indeed , as shown in  @xcite , a tiny phase for @xmath30 is always generated during rge running . ]",
    "we see that formally @xmath39 .",
    "if we consider a splitting in the squark masses that is radiatively induced through rge running , then considering only the top yukawa in the running leads to @xmath40 .",
    "bottom yukawa effects become important for large @xmath11 and can lead to @xmath41 .",
    "typically we expect that @xmath42 is at most as large as @xmath43 , however , which implies @xmath44 .",
    "we note that an expansion analogous to  ( [ eq : softmfv ] ) also exists for the trilinear couplings  @xcite .",
    "in particular , higher order terms in the expansion can lead to flavor violating trilinear terms .",
    "such terms only lead to corrections of the holomorphic higgs couplings , however .",
    "these corrections can induce flavor changing neutral higgs couplings , that are especially interesting beyond mfv , where the corresponding effects can be chirally enhanced  @xcite . in the mfv framework considered here , these effects are less important compared to contributions that are related to the loop - induced non - holomorphic higgs couplings .",
    "the only relevant trilinear couplings for our analysis are those for the third generation squarks , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which we will take to be independent parameters .    for simplicity , we will also assume universal soft masses @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in the slepton sector .",
    "the phenomenology of flavor non - universalities in the lepton sector will be reserved for future study .",
    "the only relevant trilinear term in the slepton sector is the tau trilinear coupling @xmath49 , which , along with @xmath45 and @xmath46 and all other parameters , we will take to be real .",
    "the physical higgs spectrum of the mssm consists of two neutral scalar bosons @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one neutral pseudoscalar @xmath52 , and a pair of charged higgs bosons @xmath53 . at tree level ,",
    "the full spectrum is determined by only two real parameters : the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs , @xmath54 , and the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values , @xmath55 , with @xmath56  gev@xmath57 . in the so - called decoupling limit , @xmath58 ,",
    "the masses of the higgs bosons , @xmath52 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 , are @xmath59 in this limit , the mass of the lightest higgs @xmath50 is given at tree level by @xmath60 as is well known , moderate or large values of @xmath9 and large 1-loop corrections are required to lift @xmath61 up to phenomenologically viable values .",
    "moreover , at large @xmath9 , the sbottom and stau 1-loop corrections can lower @xmath61 by a few gev , which can not be neglected given the current higgs mass precision data .",

    "the stop loop corrections , reported in the first line of  ( [ eq : deltamhiggs ] ) , are maximized for @xmath67 .",
    "the contributions from the sbottom and stau loops , in the second and third lines , always reduce the light higgs mass and can be particularly important for large @xmath11 , large values of the higgsino mass parameter , @xmath68 , and light sbottom or stau masses  @xcite .",

    "they also significantly modify charged higgs couplings to quarks  @xcite and generate flavor changing neutral higgs couplings  @xcite .",
    "all these effects become particularly relevant in the large @xmath11 regime , where the inherent 1-loop suppression can be partly compensated . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the form of the neutral and charged higgs couplings with fermions in the phenomenologically motivated limit , @xmath79 ( see  @xcite for a discussion of the regime @xmath80 ) .",

    "we demonstrated that , in addition to the typical pmssm parameters , an additional parameter , @xmath38 , reflective of the alignment of the mass splitting of the left - handed squarks , is required to discuss the flavor phenomenology of this framework . in the presence of such splitting ,",
    "this parameter controls the size of gaugino - squark loop contributions to fcncs .",
    "possible cancellations between gaugino and higgsino loop contributions have a very strong dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "we showed its impact in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays and presented expectations for its magnitude as dictated by rge running .",
    "we discussed the constraints from direct searches of the heavy mssm higgs bosons .",
    "bounds from @xmath407 searches mainly depend on @xmath54 and @xmath9 and are robust against variations of other susy parameters .",
    "separately , searches in the @xmath143 channel show a stronger dependence on the parameters under consideration , in particular on the sign and magnitude of the higgsino mass parameter , @xmath68 , and therefore provide complementary information .",
    "currently , however , the @xmath144 searches are more strongly constraining for the considered scenarios .    on the flavor side , we considered the tree level decay @xmath8 as well as the loop induced fcnc processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the recent experimental updates on the br@xmath408 show reasonable agreement with the sm prediction . at tree level , charged higgs contributions to @xmath195 interfere destructively with the sm amplitude .",
    "at the loop level , a net constructive interference is in principle possible for very large and negative @xmath176 .",
    "however , we find that the corresponding regions of parameter space are excluded by vacuum meta - stability considerations",
    ". the @xmath195 decay can lead to constraints in the @xmath54@xmath11 plane also for @xmath409 gev where current direct searches for mssm higgs bosons end . for such heavy higgs bosons",
    "however , @xmath229 only probes very large values of @xmath410 .",
    "the @xmath229 constraints depend only moderately on susy parameters other than @xmath54 and @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , they depend only weakly on possible new sources of flavor violation beyond the mfv ansatz .",
    "the constraints from the fcnc decays on the @xmath9@xmath54 plane depend crucially on several parameters , in particular the higgsino mass , @xmath68 , the stop trilinear coupling , @xmath45 , the gluino mass , @xmath106 , the mass splitting of the left - handed squarks , @xmath372 , and its alignment in flavor space , @xmath38 .",
    "the current experimental bounds on the br@xmath411 lead to strong constraints in the large @xmath9 regime of the mssm with mfv .",
    "constraints are particularly strong if the mssm contributions interfere constructively with the sm , which happens for sign@xmath328 = -1 . in that case , even for moderately large @xmath412 , heavy higgs masses of up to 1  tev can be probed .",
    "note that these bounds can have a strong dependance on @xmath372 and @xmath38 . for negative @xmath45 ,",
    "they become less constraining for larger values of @xmath38 and larger @xmath372 .",
    "the main dependence is to a good approximation on the product @xmath413 . in a msugra setup",
    "this product is correlated with the mass splitting of the right - handed up squarks @xmath378 . from our rge analysis of a simple msugra model",
    ", we expect @xmath414 for @xmath415 and @xmath38 even closer to 1 for smaller @xmath11 .",
    "we also find @xmath416 to @xmath363 , which should be approximately generic for susy breaking models with flavor universal soft masses at the gut scale and light gluinos @xmath417 tev .",
    "such values have visible impact on the bounds derived from br@xmath276 . if a lower bound on br@xmath266 above one half of the sm prediction is established in the future , destructively interfering susy contributions will also be highly constrained .",
    "it is important to stress that the mssm contributions to @xmath418 do not necessarily decouple with the susy scale , but can probe masses of susy particles far above the scales that are currently reached by direct searches . on the other hand , the mssm contributions to the @xmath3 decay",
    "do decouple with the susy scale , but even so , the @xmath3 decay can give nontrivial constraints on the mfv mssm parameter space .",
    "if susy particles are heavier than @xmath419 tev , charged higgs contributions to br@xmath420 still lead to a constraint for small @xmath54 which is almost independent of all other parameters if @xmath11 is not large . the corresponding bound in the @xmath54@xmath11 plane",
    "can be stronger than the bounds from direct searches for @xmath421 and rules out @xmath422 gev if squarks are decoupled . for a tev scale susy spectrum",
    ", susy loops can also contribute sizably to @xmath196 .",
    "this is particularly true for a sizable mass splitting @xmath372 and negative values of @xmath45 , where higgsino and gluino loop contributions add up constructively .",
    "again , @xmath38 can impact the implied constraints significantly .",
    "in contrast to @xmath418 , however , the bounds become stronger for larger values of @xmath38 , if @xmath45 is negative .",
    "a main conclusion of our work is that the current bounds from @xmath3 and @xmath2 are minimized if both @xmath68 and @xmath45 are positive . in this region of parameter space , @xmath198 generically prefers a positive sign of @xmath284 .",
    "we remark that the discussed fcnc @xmath4 decays are also sensitive to sources of flavor violation beyond mfv . for the mssm with generic flavor violating structures ,",
    "however , bounds from fcnc processes become significantly more model dependent .",
    "finally , we analyzed the impact of the updated bounds from dark matter direct detection searches .",
    "we found that the parameter space region where @xmath402 is ruled out throughout the whole @xmath54@xmath11 plane .",
    "away from bino  higgsino degeneracy , the current xenon100 bounds still give strong constraints in the @xmath54@xmath11 plane as long as @xmath396 and @xmath68 are below 1  tev and @xmath68 is positive .",
    "the direct detection bounds are minimized for negative @xmath68 , where light and heavy scalar contributions to the neutralino - proton cross section partially cancel .",
    "these direct detection constraints are the least robust among the considered bounds , since they are subject to important nuclear and astrophysical uncertainties and depend crucially on the assumption that the lightest mssm neutralino constitutes the entire dark matter in the universe .    in summary , we presented the viable mssm parameter space using the mfv assumption , incorporating the discovery of a higgs state at 125 gev , the null direct search results for supersymmetric particles and for @xmath144 and @xmath133 , and constraints from @xmath4 and @xmath423 observables as well as dark matter direct detection searches .",
    "we also discussed and imposed electroweak vacuum meta - stability requirements , and we illustrated expectations for @xmath4 flavor bounds arising from a renormalization group running analysis of generic minimal supergravity models . throughout , we have emphasized the connection between flavor observables and direct collider searches in exploring the mssm parameter space .",
    "this complementarity is not only important for understanding the present status of the mssm with mfv , but it is also central to interpreting future experimental discoveries .",

    "<S> we study the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , imposing constraints from flavor physics observables and mssm higgs searches , in light of the recent discovery of a 125 gev higgs boson by atlas and cms . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the electroweak vacuum stability conditions to further restrict the mssm parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a connection to ultraviolet physics is shown via an implementation of renormalization group running , which determines the tev - scale spectrum from a small set of minimal supergravity parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the impact from dark matter direct detection searches . </S>",
    "<S> our work highlights the complementarity of collider , flavor and dark matter probes in exploring the mssm , and shows that even in a mfv framework , flavor observables constrain the mssm parameter space well beyond the current reach of direct susy particle searches . </S>"
