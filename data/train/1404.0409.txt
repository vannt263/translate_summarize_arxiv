    "the enigma of dark matter ( dm ) remains unsolved , a mystery which has been puzzling scientists for more than 80 years .",
    "still one of the most evasive and fascinating mysteries in physics , the problem of the dm in the universe stirs the imagination of most astronomers , cosmologists and particle physicists , that are convinced that at least 90% of the mass of the universe is due to some non - luminous form of matter .    in 1933 , the astronomer fritz zwicky ( zwicky 1933 ) has observed the radial velocities of eight galaxies in the coma cluster , providing the first evidence for dm .",
    "he has found an unexpected large velocity dispersion of these galaxies which would indicate that the visible mass of ( luminous ) matter in the coma cluster was much smaller than its total mass . from these observations , he has found that the mean density of the coma cluster would have to be @xmath7 times greater than the one derived from luminous matter .",
    "zwicky then concluded that dm ( non luminous matter ) would be present and that the large velocity dispersion in coma ( and other groups of galaxies ) represents an unsolved problem .    in 1970 ,",
    "rubin and ford ( rubin & ford 1970 ) obtained the strongest evidence up to that time for the existence of dm which became the most plausible explanation for the anomalous rotation curves in spiral galaxies .",
    "cosmology and astrophysics have provided historically , many convincing evidence for the existence of dm .",
    "the primordial observations which revealed the lack of mass to explain the internal dynamics of clusters of galaxies and the rotation of galaxies , which date back as we have seen the years 30 and 70 , have been followed , more modernly , by observations that have provided substantial and consistent evidence for the existence of mass effects in regions of the universe where no luminous mass is observed .",
    "although the existence of dm is widely accepted , several other explanations of these discrepancies have also been proposed . still , besides these signs of gravitational effects , there are other types of searches for dark matter , as the identification of explicit manifestation of dm particles and indirect searches involving annihilation or decay of dm particles in the flow of cosmic rays ( cirelli 2013 ; bertone 2010 ) .",
    "past all these years after the original suggestion related to its existence , we still do not know the composition of dark matter or its nature .",
    "global fits to gravitational signal effects of dm at the cosmological and extra galactic scale for a large range of data sets ( cosmic background radiation , large - scale structure of the universe , type ia supernovae ) determine with great accuracy the amount of cold dm in the overall content of matter energy in the universe at @xmath8 ( cirelli 2013 ) , where @xmath9 represents the density of cold dm matter and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 is the hubble parameter .",
    "moreover , the observations after nine years release have placed stringent constraints to the abundance of baryons ( b ) and dark energy ( de ) ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ; spergel et al . 2003",
    "; komatsu et al .",
    "2009 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the physical baryon density and @xmath14 is the dark energy density .",
    "modernly , there are many plausible candidates for dark matter , as _ weakly - interacting massive particles _ ( wimps ) , sm neutrinos ( weinheimer 2003 ) , sterile neutrinos ( dodelson & widrow 1994 ) , axions ( rosenberg & bibber 2000 ) , supersymmetric candidates ( neutralinos , sneutrinos , gravitinos , axinos ( falk , olive , & srednicki 1994 ; feng , rajaraman & takayama 2003 ; goto & yamaguchi 1992 ) , light scalar dm ( lee & weinberg 1977 ) , dm from little higgs models ( cheng & low 2003 ) , kaluza - klein particles ( agashe & servant 2004 ) , superheavy dm ( griest & kamionkowski 1990 ) .",
    "an excellent review in theoretical and experimental aspects of dm can be found in bertone , hooper & silk ( 2005 ) .",
    "in general they are present in theories of weak - scale physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and give rise to appropriate relic abundance .",
    "calculations have shown that stable wimps can remain from the earliest moments of the universe in sufficient number to account for a significant fraction of relic dm density .",
    "this raises the hope of detecting relic wimps directly by observing their elastic scattering on targets . in the dm zoo many different types of particles",
    "have been introduced and their properties theoretically studied .",
    "many types of models that explore the physics beyond sm , share in common the presence of new @xmath15 vector bosons .",
    "these new bosons are introduced basically in two ways : ( i ) minimal coupling ; ( ii ) stueckelberg mechanism",
    ". a new vector gauge boson would be massless if a new @xmath15 symmetry should remain unbroken .",
    "this would imply in a long range force if it were to couple to ordinary matter , unless the coupling were incredibly small .",
    "this case would be allowed if the primary coupling were to a hidden sector and connected only by higher - dimensional operators or alternatively by kinetic mixing with the photon . in the case of kinetic mixing , this scenario would induce a small fractional electric charge for hidden sector particles .",
    "usually this class of models the extra gauge boson is called the @xmath16 .",
    "now , the experimental discovery of a @xmath16 would be exciting , but the implications would be much greater than just the existence of a new vector boson . breaking the @xmath17 symmetry would require , for example , an extended higgs , with significant consequences for collider physics and cosmology ( langacker 2009 ) .    following a different approach than the usual models with extra @xmath15 sectors in the sm",
    ", we study the consequences of the introduction of new complex vector bosons @xmath16 and @xmath18 subject to dual symmetry ( dusy ) requirements .",
    "an interesting conjecture is to apply this theory to cp violation .",
    "it is well known that if cp violation in the lepton sector is experimentally determined to be too small to account for matter - antimatter asymmetry , some new physics beyond the standard model would be required to explain additional sources of cp violation .",
    "fortunately , it is generally the case that adding new particles and/or interactions to the standard model introduces new sources of cp violation . in what follows we use the minkowski space - time @xmath19 with signature ( @xmath20 ) , and assume natural units @xmath21 .",
    "since seminal works of dirac on magnetic monopoles ( dirac 1931 , 1948 ) a great deal of theoretical interest has appeared , despite no confirmed experimental evidence of their existence up to the present .",
    "dirac s conclusions about the possibility of the existence of magnetic monopoles were based on a logical conclusion . in a paper published in 1931 ( dirac 1931 )",
    ", dirac showed that if a magnetic particle interacts with an electrically charged particle , according to the laws of quantum mechanics , the electric charge of the particle must necessarily be quantized . from a complementary reciprocal reasoning , as we know that electric charges are quantized dirac concluded that magnetic monopoles must be taken seriously .    in the article published in 1948 ( dirac 1948 )",
    ", dirac sets up a general theory of charged particles and magnetic poles in interaction through the medium of the electromagnetic field .",
    "using the four components coordinates @xmath22 with @xmath23 to fix a point in space and time and the velocity of light to be unit , the starting point of dirac s formulation was the ordinary electromagnetic field , @xmath24 at any point : f_=_a_-_a _ , a = ( v , ) , [ f ] where @xmath25 represents the electromagnetic @xmath26-potential .    in vacuum ,",
    "maxwell s equations @xmath27 exhibit a high degree of symmetry : they are invariant under conformal lorentz transformation and under electromagnetic duality , @xmath28 .",
    "this discrete symmetry is a particular case of a continuous symmetry @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a pseudoscalar .",
    "a consequence of this symmetry is that all fundamental properties of free electromagnetic fields , such as energy , momentum , angular momentum , among others , are symmetric with respect to this transformation .",
    "lorentz invariance can be made manifest by introducing additionally to the electromagnetic field strength @xmath24 , its dual @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath24 is an antisymmetric @xmath33-vector , @xmath34 , it can be shown that the unique way to construct a dual lorentz - invariant four - tensor involving the electromagnetic field that is independent of the original field strength tensor is @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents a tensor equivalent to the levi - civita four - tensor . in minkowski space , @xmath37 .",

    "the third term is proportional to @xmath61 and is not invariant under parity .",
    "the second term corresponds to the dual sector of the original electromagnetic field and is not our first option .",
    "we then write @xmath62 in this equation , the factor @xmath63 is a matter of convention ; any multiplicative factor would have given the same equations of motion .    in order to obtain a more complete lagrangian density one might try the naive choice @xmath64 where the two fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 are considered independent .",
    "but since in reality they actually describe the same electromagnetic field , @xmath67 . the second expression in eq .",

    "another important property is that maxell s equations are invariant under the following dual global transformation f^ & & f^+ ^ + ^&&- f^ + ^ [ max34 ] where @xmath31 is the dual angle .",
    "the inclusion of matter , _",
    "i.e. _ electric ( @xmath68 ) and magnetic ( @xmath69 ) charges , implies that the zeros in ( [ f ] ) are replaced by electric @xmath70 and magnetic @xmath71 current densities that obey the following transformations j^e _ & & j^e_+ j^m _ + j^m_&&-j^e _",

    "the lorentz force written in a covariant notation f^= j^e_f^+j^m _ ^ [ imax36 ] is invariant under the combined transformations ( [ max34 ] ) and ( [ max35 ] ) , so there is no fundamental restrictions on the values of the dual angle @xmath31 , which can be set to any convenient value , as for instance , = ( ) .",
    "[ imax37 ]    due to the duality transformation , one can not decide whether a particle has electric charge , magnetic charge or both just observing and comparing its behavior with the predictions of maxwell s equations .",
    "it is only a convention , not a requirement of maxwell s equations , that electrons have electric charge , but do not have magnetic charge : a @xmath72 transformation of the dual angle may originate exactly the opposite result .",
    "the fundamental empirical fact is that all observed particles always have the same ratio of magnetic charge and electric charge ; transformations of the dual angle can change the ratio to any arbitrary numerical value but can not change the fact that all particles have the same proportion of electric and magnetic charges .",
    "thus , there must be a transformation for which this reason equals to zero , so this particular choice makes the magnetic charge equal to zero .",
    "this particular choice is the conventional adopted definition in electromagnetism . for example , one can choose a dual transformation that sets j_m^&&-j_e^ + j_m^=0 , [ imax38 ] which results in non - symmetrical maxwell s equations @xmath73 with @xmath74 . in summary , applying a dual transformation on symmetrical maxwell equations ( with non - zero @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , one can obtain non - symmetrical equations ( with only one @xmath75 current ) in which the resulting particles carry both electric and magnetic charges . for a particle with explicit magnetic charge to be observable , its ratio @xmath76 must be different than those of other particles",
