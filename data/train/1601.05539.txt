    "memory is a non - volatile storage medium that is both electrically programmable and erasable . it has been widely used because of its reliability , relative low cost , and high storage density . in flash memories ,",
    "a block which contains many cells can maintain a block of charge levels to represent information .",
    "however , the flash memory has its inherent asymmetry between cell programming ( injecting cells with charge ) and cell erasure ( removing charge from cells ) .",
    "that is to say , increasing the charge level of a single cell ( cell programming ) is an easy operation , but decreasing the charge level of a single cell ( cell erasure ) is a very difficult process . in the current flash memories architecture ,",
    "a single - cell erasure operation includes copying a large whole block which contains the single cell to a temporary location , erasing it , and then reprogramming all the cells in the block . in the programming operation , some cells may be injected with extra charge .",
    "this will lead to overshooting of charge . then , overprogramming ( overshooting of charge ) is a severe problem because of some very difficult cell erasure operations .",
    "thus , in order to avoiding overprogramming , injecting a cell with charge by many iterations makes its charge level gradually approach the desirable level in the cell programming operation . due to charge leakage or reading disturbance , these may result in some errors in flash memory cells .",
    "the rank modulation scheme has been recently proposed in @xcite to overcome these outstanding problems . in this scheme ,",
    "one permutation is induced by relative rankings of the charge levels on a group of cells instead of using absolute values of charge levels . moreover ,",
    "this permutation is used to represent information .",
    "specifically , assume that @xmath2 represent the charge levels of @xmath3 cells respectively , then the charge levels of these cells induce one permutation @xmath4\\in s_n$ ] such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the set of all the permutations over @xmath7 . in order to avoid the overprogramming ,",
    "the cell programming uses only `` push - to - the - top '' operations @xcite .",
    "that is , a cell is programmed by raising the charge level of this cell above those of all others in the block .",
    "therefore , in the manner , the overprogramming is no longer a problem .",
    "moveover , when injection of some extra charge or leakage may not change their relative rankings , then the permutation induced by their relative rankings will not change .",
    "hence , this will not cause an encoding error .",
    "however , when the relative rankings are changed because of injection of much extra charge or leakage in the cells , the permutation induced by the relative rankings will be different from the desired permutation , i.e. , this leads to an encoding error . to detect and/or correct such errors",
    ", we require an appropriate distance measure in the permutations .",
    "there are several metrics on the permutations such as the @xmath0-metric @xcite , @xcite , the ulam metric @xcite , and the kendall s @xmath8-metric @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider only the @xmath0-metric .    in the rank modulation scheme ,",
    "gray codes are important codes which represent information in flash memories . in @xcite , jiang _",
    "_ proposed the gray codes by using `` push - to - the - top '' operations . for the gray code",
    ", it was first presented in @xcite , where it is a sequence of distinct binary vectors of fixed length and every adjacent pair differs in a single coordinate . in practice , they are widely used in many applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , a good survey on the gray codes is given in @xcite .",
    "recently , gray codes for rank modulation have been studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a snake - in - the - box code is a gray code in which the distance of any two distinct codewords in the code is at least @xmath9 .",
    "thus , this code can detect a single error in one codeword .",
    "in particular , the snake - in - the - box codes are usually studied in the context of binary codes in the hamming scheme , e.g.@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will only focus on the snake - in - the - box codes under the @xmath0-metric .    in @xcite , yehezkeally and schwartz",
    "constructed directly a snake - in - the - box code of length @xmath10 in @xmath11 under the @xmath0-metric . in this paper , we will improve on this result .",
    "on the one hand , we will construct a snake of length @xmath12 in @xmath11 . on the other hand",
    ", we will also construct the longer @xmath0-snakes by using @xmath1-snakes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we will give some basic definitions for the rank modulation scheme and notations required in this paper . in section [ sec3 ] , we give directly two constructions of @xmath0-snakes in @xmath6 . in section [ sec4 ] , we present some examples of these two constructions . in section [ sec5 ] , we compare our results with the previous ones .",
    "section [ sec6 ] concludes this paper .",
    "in this section , we will use some definitions and notations mentioned in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the gray code is called _ complete _ if @xmath34 , and _ cyclic _ if there exists @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
