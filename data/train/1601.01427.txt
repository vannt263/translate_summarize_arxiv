    "deployment of heterogeneous cellular networks ( hcns ) is a promising approach to providing seamless wireless coverage and high network throughput in 5 g mobile communication .",
    "a hcn deploys a variety of infrastructure , such as macro , pico , and femto base stations ( bss ) , as well as fixed relay stations in different tiers @xcite .",
    "bss in different tiers have different transmit powers and coverages .",
    "for example , a macrocell uses the highest power to provide large coverage , while a femtocell is usually a low - power home bs intended for short - range communications .",
    "due to the co - channel spectrum sharing between different tiers , network interference in the hcn is much more severe than that in a conventional single - tier cellular network , thus posing a challenge to the successful co - existence of tiers @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the major challenges in deploying hcns is to efficiently manage network interference .",
    "femtocell access control , using either closed or open access , is an important mechanism for interference management @xcite . in closed access ,",
    "femtocell access points provide service only to the specified subscribers , whereas arbitrary nearby users can use the femtocell in open access .",
    "@xcite point out that open access is preferred by network operators , since it not only efficiently reduces cross - tier interference , but also provides an inexpensive way to expand network capacity .    however , due to the open system architecture of a hcn and the broadcast nature of wireless communications , information transmissions intended for authorized user equipments ( ues ) are more vulnerable to eavesdroppers ( also named unauthorized users ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hcn ] , eavesdroppers ( eves ) find it easy to overhear legitimate communications . therefore , secure transmission is a significant concern when designing hcns .",
    "unfortunately , the existing literature on hcns has mainly focused on network throughput and energy efficiency ; little of it has involved security issues .        physical layer security ( pls ) , or , information - theoretic security , has drawn ever - increasing attention since wyner s seminal research @xcite , where he introduced the degraded wiretap channel model and defined the concept of _ secrecy capacity_. during the past decades , the wiretap channel model has been generalized to multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) channels @xcite-@xcite , cooperative relay channels @xcite-@xcite , and two - way channels @xcite-@xcite , etc .",
    "a large number of secrecy transmission techniques and schemes have been proposed for wireless communications ( refer to @xcite and its references ) .",
    "early research on pls has focused on point - to - point links or single - cell scenarios . in some works ,",
    "eve s channel state information ( csi ) is assumed to be perfectly known at the transmitter , which is clearly not practical in real wiretap scenarios , since eves are usually passive . without eve s csi , goel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a multi - antenna transmission strategy with artificial noise embedded into information signals to confuse eve .",
    "this method has become a popular approach to enhance the pls , and has attracted a stream of research , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the idea of artificial noise has also been extended to relay systems with jammers , in which cooperative jamming techniques @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have been proposed to improve pls .",
    "however , due to dynamic and large - scale wireless network topologies , the spatial positions of network nodes and propagation path losses become very critical factors influencing secrecy performance , which unfortunately has been considered by none of the above endeavors .    recently",
    ", stochastic geometry theory has provided a powerful tool to study the average behavior of a network by modeling the positions of network nodes according to a spatial distribution such as a poisson point process ( ppp ) @xcite . under a stochastic geometry framework",
    ", authors in @xcite-@xcite studied the secure multi - antenna transmission against ppp distributed eves .",
    "more specifically , zhou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite evaluated the secure connectivity of two multi - antenna transmission techniques : a directional antenna scheme and an eigen - beamforming scheme .",
    "@xcite investigated the average secrecy outage probability in a multi - input single - output ( miso ) wiretap channel for both non - colluding and colluding eves .",
    "@xcite derived the probability of a positive secrecy rate achieved by the artificial - noise method in mimo channels .",
    "@xcite , @xcite proposed both dynamic and static parameter design schemes for the artificial - noise - aided transmission to maximize secrecy throughput subject to a secrecy outage probability constraint",
    ".    research on pls has been further extended to ad hoc networks @xcite , @xcite and cellular networks @xcite , @xcite , where the placement of transmitters and receivers are both modeled as ppps .",
    "@xcite , @xcite considered single- and multi - antenna transmissions in an ad hoc network , and provided a tradeoff analysis between connectivity and secrecy , and further measured the secrecy transmission capacity . wang _",
    "@xcite evaluated the secrecy performance of cellular networks considering the cell association and information exchange between bss , and provided tractable results for the achievable secrecy rate under different assumptions on the information of eves locations .",
    "however , they only considered a single - antenna case , ignoring both small - scale fading and inter - cell interference .",
    "this work has been extended by @xcite , where geraci _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the average secrecy rate utilizing the regularized channel inversion transmit precoding from a perspective of massive mimo systems .    due to the multi - tier hierarchical architecture , hcns",
    "bring new challenges to the investigation of pls compared with the conventional single - tier topology @xcite .",
    "in addition to cross - cell interference , hcns introduce severe cross - tier interference . both reliability and secrecy of data transmissions should be taken into account , which makes analyzing the impact of interference on both ues and eves much more complicated , especially when system parameters differ between different tiers . besides , mobile terminals can access an arbitrary tier , e.g. , open access , which calls for specific mobile association policies that consider both quality of service ( qos ) and secrecy .    a very recent contribution @xcite considered pls in a two - tier heterogeneous network with one eve wiretapping macrocell users .",
    "we point out that , the authors in @xcite focused on the design / optimization of secrecy beamforming , but not from the perspective of network analysis and deployment .",
    "their conclusions are based on the idealized assumption that the csi of the eve is perfectly available .",
    "moreover , they considered neither the multi - eve wiretap scenarios , nor the random spatial positions of network nodes and the large - scale path loss . to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has accounted for pls when designing hcns , and a fundamental analysis framework to evaluate the secrecy performance in hcns is lacking , which has motivated our work .      in this paper , we extend pls to a @xmath0-tier hcn where the positions of bss , ues and eves are all modeled as independent homogeneous ppps .",
    "we provide a comprehensive performance analysis of artificial - noise - aided multi - antenna secure transmission under a stochastic geometry framework .",
    "our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * i * ) we propose a secrecy mobile association policy based on the _ truncated average received signal power _ ( arsp ) .",
    "specifically , a typical ue is only permitted to associate with the bs providing the highest arsp ; if the highest arsp is below a pre - set access threshold , the ue remains inactive .",
    "we derive closed - form expressions for the tier association probability for this policy ( the probability that a tier is associated with the typical ue ) and the bs activation probability ( the probability that a bs associates at least one ue ) , which are essential to analyze the key performance metrics .",
    "* ii * ) we analyze the connection probability of a randomly located ue , which is defined as the probability that the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of the ue lies above a target sinr .",
    "we derive a new accurate integral representation of the connection probability and an analytically tractable expression under the interference - limited case .",
    "an asymptotic analysis of the connection probability reveals that setting a larger access threshold is beneficial for improving link quality .",
    "* iii * ) we analyze the user secrecy probability , which is defined as the probability that the sinr of an arbitrary eve lies below a sinr threshold .",
    "we derive analytical upper and lower bounds for the secrecy probability , which are close to the exact values in the high secrecy probability region .",
    "we find that the access threshold , bs density and power allocation ratio respectively displays a tradeoff between the connection and secrecy probabilities , and that these parameters should be carefully designed to balance link quality and secrecy .",
    "* iv * ) we investigate network - wide secrecy throughput subject to connection and secrecy probability constraints .",
    "we derive closed - form expressions for the rate of redundant information in small - antenna and large - antenna cases , respectively .",
    "we further evaluate the minimum per user secrecy throughput .",
    "we show that , compared with non - threshold mobile access , our threshold - based policy can significantly increase secrecy throughout when the access threshold is properly chosen .    leveraging the obtained analytical expressions , we provide various tractable predictions of network performance and guidelines for future network designs .",
    "for instance , setting a larger access threshold helps to improve link quality .",
