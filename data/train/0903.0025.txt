    "the fact that higgs has not been discovered yet brings a question on the naturalness of weak scale supersymmetry . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) predicts the light higgs to be lighter than the z boson at tree level and to increase it above the current experimental bound 114 gev @xcite requires a large one loop correction implying that the top squark ( stop ) is very heavy @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one way out was to introduce a new quartic coupling in addition to one in the mssm which goes beyond the mssm . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss many possibilities based on the extension of the mssm .",
    "instead we ask what is the best way to reduce fine tuning in the mssm .",
    "it has been pointed out that large soft trilinear coupling of higgs and stops can provide a correction which can raise the light higgs mass above the lep ii bound @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "there are recent reviews on the topic in @xcite @xcite .",
    "heavy stop can increase higgs mass by its log correction at the expense of severe fine tuning .",
    "sizable correction to the higgs mass is also possible by finite threshold correction from large trilinear coupling @xmath3 ( maximal stop mixing ) even for moderate value of stop mass . in reality",
    "it is hard to obtain such a large stop mixing from high energy theory , e.g. , starting from the gut scale boundary condition .",
    "however , it is possible if stop mass squared is negative at high energy and universal relations in sfermions and/or gauginos are given up @xcite .",
    "the least fine tuned parameter space indicates that we might live in a meta - stable vacuum .",
    "this model independent observation has been explicitly realized in the gauge messenger models @xcite .",
    "if x and y gauge bosons and gauginos can serve as a messenger of supersymmetry breaking , the threshold correction at the gut scale provides negative squark mass squared and nonuniversal gaugino masses such that viable phenomenological spectrum can be obtained at the weak scale and at the same time the fine tuning for the electroweak symmetry breaking can be reduced .",
    "the characteristic feature of the large stop mixing scenario @xcite is the presence of the transition scale @xmath4 at which the stop mass squared changes sign . in order to have a longevity of our universe",
    ", the scale @xmath4 should be higher than 10 tev @xcite .",
    "the prediction on the stop mass squared at the gut scale is based on the assumption that big desert exists between the gut scale and the weak scale such that renormalization group running is obtained only with the mssm particles .",
    "the trajectory can be modified at high energy with the presence of new degrees of freedom .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that the effect of the hidden sector running can affect the overall size of the soft parameters and maximal stop mixing can be obtained by this effect @xcite , @xcite . especially when the hidden sector couples strongly , the effect of the hidden sector running can suppress soft scalar mass squared and can be a solution of notorious @xmath2 and @xmath5 problem in gauge mediation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the effect of scalar sequestering also explains the electroweak symmetry breaking in a rather natural way even in the presence of large @xmath2 as long as @xmath2 is generated from generalized giudice - masiero mechanism ( from kahler potential ) @xcite . in the simplest version of @xmath2 generation",
    ", a direct coupling of higgs with messengers can naturally provide @xmath2 of the order of the other supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "it is the presence of @xmath5 which is too large .",
    "there are technical solutions with new singlets in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these singlets are heavy ( or much heavier ) compared to the weak scale and the weak scale physics would be exactly that of the mssm .    though there is no explicit setup in which the anomalous dimensions with the desired properties are computed , it would be worth exploring the implication of this possibility with the hope that it can be realized eventually .",
    "the immediate outcome of the setup is the presence of the scale @xmath4 at which the scalar mass squared are largely suppressed .",
    "it is the scale at which the strong hidden sector cft ceases to contribute to the running and @xmath4 sets the effective scale at which all the boundary conditions are given .",
    "note the similarity of @xmath4 in two different scenarios .",
    "in one scenario , the usual extrapolation of the rg running drives the stop mass squared to be negative above @xmath4 . in scalar sequestering , above @xmath4 , the scalar mass squared are effectively zero as it is exponentially suppressed by large anomalous dimension of the hidden cft .",
    "the second observation is in the higgs sector .",
    "even when @xmath2 is large ( a few tev ) , @xmath6 can be one loop suppressed compared to @xmath7 such that the electroweak scale can be lower than @xmath2 without having a serious fine tuning .",
    "this provides heavy gauginos and higgsinos ( a few tev ) and light squarks , sleptons and all the higgs fields ( @xmath8 ) at a few hundreds gev .",
    "below tev , the mssm spectrum would consist of sfermions and higgs fields only .",
    "indeed this pattern of sparticle spectrum provides the least fine tuned electroweak symmetry breaking as @xmath9 can be naturally light compared to gauginos and higgsinos . to tev . ] these patterns of sparticle spectrum have not been considered so far .",
    "it would be interesting to see what would be the phenomenological signatures of this scenario .",
    "we address this question by looking at the threshold correction to the higgs mass when @xmath2 is large .",
    "large @xmath2 and also large @xmath3 can provide effective operators @xmath10 and alters the higgs phenomenology drastically .",
    "the correction appears in the off - diagonal entry of the higss mass matrix ( @xmath11 ) and also in the diagonal entry ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these two corrections can increase the light higgs mass .",
    "we emphasize the correction coming from off - diagonal element in this paper .",
    "the branching ratio of the higgs decay can also be seriously modified as the correction in the presence of large @xmath2 can easily cancel the original off - diagonal entry and no mixing between two scalar higgs fields is realized even for @xmath13 .",
    "no higgs mixing has been considered previously in the context of large @xmath1 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the original off - diagonal entry is very small if @xmath1 is large as it is suppressed by @xmath1 .",
    "thus even small corrections can alter the mixing angle in a drastic way and changes the higgs phenomenology .",
    "the difference here is that there is also an impact on the light higgs mass when @xmath1 is moderate , 5 to 10 as the correction itself is large enough .",
    "the tree level off - diagonal element is too small for large @xmath1 and the net effect of off - diagonal cancellation to the higgs mass is negligibly small there .",
    "the higgs mass is increased as a result of cancelling the off - diagonal element by the threshold correction . for moderate @xmath1 , this effect on the higgs mass",
    "can be sizable .",
    "in the special limit of zero mixing angle between two cp even higgs bosons , the light cp even higgs is just @xmath15 and the heavy cp even higgs is @xmath16 .",
    "then the cp even higgs does not couple to bottom quark and tau lepton at tree level of yukawa couplings and can affect the higgs branching ratio dramatically . in the mssm at tree level ,",
    "the mixing between two cp even higgs bosons are suppressed as @xmath1 increases . however , at the same time , the yukawa coupling of down type quarks and leptons are enhanced by @xmath1 and as a consequence the coupling of the light cp even higgs to bottom quark and tau lepton is not suppressed .",
    "we use dred scheme for the computation of one loop correction to the higgs mass and also use the same scheme in feynhiggs @xcite for the plots presented here .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are chosen to be real in this paper .",
    "in general it is very difficult to obtain small scalar mass compared to the fermion ( gaugino ) mass as there is no symmetry which can forbid the scalar mass while allowing the gaugino mass .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that strong hidden sector running can suppress the soft scalar mass compared to the gaugino mass through the running from the messenger scale to the scale at which the hidden sector is integrated out .",
    "the dimension of the operator @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be given by & = & d_o + , + & = & 2d_o + , where @xmath19 is the classical dimension of the operator @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators . if @xmath22 , the hidden sector running provides a different suppression effect on @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as a result",
    "we can obtain a small soft scalar mass from the running .",
    "let @xmath23 be the scale of messengers at which the operators involving the visible sector and the supersymmetry breaking field are generated .",
    "@xmath4 is the scale at which the strongly interacting hidden sector deviates from the conformal regime . in between @xmath23 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the operators generating soft scalar mass and the gaugino mass are affected by the hidden sector running .    as an illustrated example , let us take the minimal gauge mediation with the supersymmetry breaking field @xmath24 . at the messenger scale @xmath23 , m_1/2 & = & , + m^2 & = & c ( ) ^2 | |^2 .",
    "at the scale @xmath4 , m_1/2 & = & ( ) ^m_1/2 ( m_mess ) , + m^2 & = & ( ) ^m^2 ( m_mess ) .",
    "note that the soft scalar mass @xmath25 can be suppressed by ( ) ^-2 , compared to @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath28 suppression is easy to obtain with @xmath29 , @xmath30 as long as @xmath4 is much lower than @xmath23 .",
    "this can provide an effective boundary condition at @xmath4 which resembles the low scale gaugino mediation .    if @xmath4 is low enough ( close to the weak scale ) , we get an effective boundary condition in which all dimension two parameters are much smaller than the square of the dimension one parameters . as a result @xmath31 and @xmath2 can be larger by a ( square root of ) loop factor compared to @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath2 is generated from giudice - masiero mechanism ( from kahler potential with the supersymmetry breaking field ) , @xmath9 and @xmath33 appearing in the higgs mass squared are also suppressed and large @xmath2 is not directly linked to the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the effect of the running below @xmath4 which is mostly given by large @xmath3 term and is nothing to do with large @xmath2 . for @xmath4 close to the weak scale @xmath0 ,",
    "no large log appears and the electroweak scale is naturally smaller than the scale of @xmath3 as it appears from the rg running .",
    "the simplest version of the cft has @xmath34 as @xmath4 is the only scale existing in the cft . in this case",
    "the lowest possible @xmath4 is about 1000 tev when @xmath23 is about @xmath35 tev to keep @xmath36 at around 1 tev . for large @xmath23",
    ", @xmath4 becomes even larger .",
    "however , in principle we can consider @xmath4 close to tev by allowing a deviation from @xmath34 in explicit realization of this scenario . though it is possible to suppress soft scalar mass enough such that it is much smaller than the gaugino mass",
    ", there is a visible sector loop correction which appears in any case . without knowing the detailed knowledge of the strongly coupled hidden sector",
    ", we can not compute this effect .",
    "nevertheless , one loop correction from the visible sector is unavoidable and the small scalar mass squared is understood up to this one loop threshold correction which is not calculable .",
    "note that for a certain amount of sequestering the original boundary condition of soft scalar mass is washed out and is replaced by one loop threshold correction ( which is not calculable ) .    as a result",
    "the boundary condition is summarized as follows .",
    "we have large @xmath36 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 while m & & m_1/2 , at @xmath4 . more explicitly , m_q^2 m_u^c^2 m_d^c^2 m_l^2 m_e^c^2 m_1/2 ^ 2 , + ^2 + m_h_u^2 ^2 + m_h_d^2 m_1/2 ^ 2 , where @xmath37 should be understood as one loop suppression including unknown one loop threshold correction as above .",
    "from now on we do not rely on specific mediation mechanism and will explore the parameter space which keeps the qualitative features of scalar sequestering ( heavy gauginos , heavy higgsinos and possibly large @xmath3 term ) .",
    "the characteristic features of scalar sequestering is following .",
    "1 .   sfermions ( scalars ) are lighter than gauginos ( fermions ) .",
    "large @xmath2 does not cause fine tuning in the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "higgs fields ( scalars ) are lighter than higgsinos ( fermions ) .    before discussing higgs phenomenology ,",
    "we just make a short comment on the collider signatures of scalar sequestering .",
    "below @xmath36 ( symbolically denoting gauginos and higgsinos at the same time ) , one can write down the effective theory in terms of squarks , sleptons and higgs in addition to the sm fields after integrating out gauginos . dimension five operators for the sfermions @xmath38 and the fermions @xmath39 are obtained as following . &",
    "= & _ i^ * _ j^ * _ i _ j. the squarks are produced and have three body decays with a jet , lepton and slepton .",
    "the slepton decays into lepton and goldstino eventually .",
    "the on - shell two body cascade decays do not appear and sharp edge in the invariant mass distribution will not appear as a consequence .",
    "to increase the cp even light higgs mass , people have concentrated on increasing the quartic of up type higgs ( for @xmath40 ) .",
    "this increases the diagonal term and helps raise the light higgs mass . however , there is the other way of increasing higgs mass which is to reduce the off - diagonal terms in the higgs mass matrix .    in the mssm ,",
    "the tree level mass matrix for the cp even higgs fields is given by ^2 & = & (    cc m_a^2 ^2 + m_z^2 ^2 & - ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) + - ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) & m_z^2 ^2 + m_a^2 ^2    ) , for @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath40 , it is convenient to write down the expression in terms of @xmath42 and expand it up to @xmath43 .",
    "the expression is then ^2 & = & (    cc m_a^2 + ( m_z^2 -m_a^2 ) ^2 & - ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) + - ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) & m_z^2 + ( m_a^2 -m_z^2 ) ^2    ) .",

    "for @xmath47 and @xmath48 gev ]    note that an interesting result is obtained if the off - diagonal elements vanishes . _ 12 = ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) .",

    "compared to the case when the correction to the off - diagonal element is negligible , @xmath49 , the lightest eigenvalue is increased by @xmath50 which would be important unless @xmath51 is too small .",
    "no higgs mixing alters dominant decay channel of higgs . for the light higgs with mass at around 110 gev to 130 gev ( the mssm range ) ,",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath52 .",

    "however , at the same time , you get a constraint on the largest possible size of @xmath105 . if @xmath112 , the largest possible correction to the light higgs mass is bounded by 16 v^2 & & 4 ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) ^2 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the correction is very small unless @xmath45 is large enough .",
    "the inequality limits the possible correction to the light higgs mass . for @xmath114 gev and @xmath115 , the largest possible",
    "@xmath105 which keeps the validity of the expression is when @xmath116 and it increases the higgs mass just by 5 gev ( from 90 gev to 95 gev ) .",
    "* no mixing regime , @xmath117    no mixing regime is very interesting as it changes the branching fraction of higgs entirely . with a cancellation of the off - diagonal element ,",
    "the decay to @xmath57 is suppressed and the couplings of the higgs to down type quarks and charged leptons are highly reduced .",
    "hence , other decay modes can have a sizable branching fraction , e.g. , @xmath118 .",
    "( the partial decay width @xmath119 is hardly changed . ) for the higgs mass , the prediction is very easy .",
    "for given @xmath120 and @xmath1 , we can fix the @xmath105 correction from the no mixing relation . 4 v^2 & = & ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) .",

    ", we can increase @xmath122 gev to @xmath123 gev .    *",
    "large correction regime , @xmath124    the maximum of the light higgs mass occurs roughly when the off - diagonal elements flip the sign by @xmath105 correction though the exact condition for the maximum depends on whole matrix elements ( @xmath45 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "4v^2 & ~ & 2 ( m_a^2+m_z^2 ) .",

    "of course it is important to consider the higher order correction like @xmath126 and other higher dimensional operators .",
    "it is important that the higgs mixing angle @xmath44 between @xmath127 and @xmath128 has the opposite sign compared to the usual mssm .",
    "the change of the sign affects the branching ratio from the interference terms .",
    "even for the small mixing angle @xmath129 , the partial decay width @xmath130 can change from -33 % to 50 % .",
    "no discovery of supersymmetric particles puts a strong constraint on the weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "most of all the mssm is seriously threatened by the higgs mass bound . to understand why the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking is so low compared to other sparticle masses",
    "would be the main issue concerning the weak scale supersymmetry ( especially the mssm ) . in this paper",
    "we use this constraint to understand the sparticle spectrum of the mssm . rather than relying on the usual logarithmic correction from the top loop which causes a serious fine tuning problem , we focus on finite threshold corrections arising when stops are integrated out .",
    "maximal stop mixing scenario is one of the most attractive possibilities from this point of view .",
    "in addition , the idea of scalar sequestering using the strongly coupled hidden sector brings an entirely new patterns of sparticle spectrum .",
    "sfermions and higgs fields are light while gauginos are higgsinos are heavy",
    ". if ` generalized ' giudice - masiero mechanism is responsible for the generation of the @xmath2 term , the electroweak scale can be smaller by ( the square root of ) the loop factor compared to @xmath2 ( the higgsino mass ) .",
    "naturally large @xmath2 opens new possibility of increasing the higgs mass by cancelling the off - diagonal elements using the threshold correction easily by 10 to 20 gev .",
    "this correction at the same time alters the higgs mixing angle entirely and the higgs decay branching fraction is drastically modified as a consequence .",
    "the same phenomenology happens even for small @xmath2 if @xmath1 is large enough as the off - diagonal element is negligible from the beginning . in this case",
    ", however , the correction to the higgs mass is very small and the correction just alters the higgs mixing angle .    for large @xmath2 and moderate @xmath1",
    "as discussed in this paper , the same correction not only changes the higgs mixing angle but also increases the light higgs mass significantly . as a result",
    "the lep bound on the light higgs mass can be explained without heavy stop mass and leaves a room for a natural understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the mssm . the suppression of @xmath131 branching ratio and the enhancement of @xmath132 branching ratio as a result might allow unexpected early discovery of the light higgs using the trilepton signature at the lhc .",
    "the heavy higgs also has an enhanced production cross section as the coupling to the gauge boson is enhanced compared to the case of no sizable @xmath46 correction .",
    "we leave a detailed study of discovery potential of the higgs at the lhc with this scenario as a future work .",
