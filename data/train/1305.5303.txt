    "the general study of reaction systems with mass - action kinetics goes back at least to the pioneering work of feinberg , horn , and jackson in the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "the class of systems under consideration in this paper includes such mass - action systems , as well as power - law systems and s - systems from biochemical systems theory  @xcite .    quite apart from the context of biochemistry , such systems appear to be objects of intrinsic interest for engineers and mathematicians .",
    "for instance , essentially identical models have been investigated in genetic algorithms  @xcite and population dynamics  @xcite .",
    "models with similar mathematical structure have been studied in distributed systems  @xcite and algebraic statistics  @xcite .",
    "connections between these systems and binomial algebra and toric geometry have been stressed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the global attractor conjecture ( gac ) is the focus of this paper .",
    "given a reaction system , conservation laws induce a foliation of the concentration space ( which is a positive orthant ) by polyhedra that are forward - invariant with respect to the dynamics .",
    "it is well - known that when the dynamics of a reaction system admit a `` pseudo - helmholtz free energy function '' as a strict lyapunov function , then each forward - invariant polyhedron contains a special equilibrium point , sometimes called the `` birch point '' due to a connection to birch s theorem @xcite .",
    "the gac , which has resisted attempts at proof for four decades  @xcite , asserts that every trajectory asymptotically approaches the unique birch point in its forward - invariant polyhedron .",
    "a survey of literature relevant to the gac appears in section  [ s : conjs ] .",
    "the gac is usually stated for complex - balanced systems , which are generalizations of the more well - known detailed - balanced systems .",
    "complex - balanced systems are known to admit pseudo - helmholtz free energy functions as lyapunov functions .",
    "specializing the gac to the case of networks in which every reaction has the form @xmath0 ( that is , every complex is a species ) yields the well - known ergodic theorem for continuous - time , discrete - space , autonomous markov chains  @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", the gac may be viewed as an ergodicity conjecture for chemical reaction networks evolving under mass - action kinetics . indeed",
    ", reaction systems theory may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of the theory of continuous - time discrete - space autonomous markov chains .",
    "a key idea in our work is that the combinatorial geometry of a reaction network in the space of ( chemical ) complexes  the reactants and products of the reactions  informs the dynamics in concentration space .",
    "this connection was anticipated to a certain extent by the `` extended permanence conjecture '' ( conjecture  [ conj : ext_permanence ] ) of craciun , nazarov , and pantea , which implies the gac  @xcite .",
    "their conjecture captures the intuitively appealing idea that if a reaction network `` points inwards '' , in the sense of being endotactic ( see definition  [ d : endotactic ] ) , then the corresponding dynamics in concentration space must also roughly `` point inwards '' , in the sense of being permanent ( see definition  [ d : persistent_permanent ] ) .",
    "we develop the correspondence between geometry of a network in the space of complexes and dynamics in concentration space by analyzing the contributions of each reaction to the dynamics along `` toric jets '' ( definition  [ d : jet].[d : toricjet ] ) . in doing so",
    ", we positively resolve the extended permanence conjecture for a subclass of endotactic networks called `` strongly endotactic '' networks ( definition  [ d : endotactic ] ) , our first main result .",
    "[ thm : main ] every strongly endotactic reaction network is permanent .",
    "as stated above , the extended permanence conjecture implies the gac .",
    "[ thm : main2 ] the gac holds for strongly endotactic complex - balanced reaction systems .    the fact that weakly reversible networks with one linkage class ( i.e. , with strongly connected reaction graph ) are strongly endotactic ( corollary  [ cor : one_l_class ] ) yields an easy consequence .",
    "[ thm : onelclass ] every weakly reversible reaction network with exactly one linkage class is permanent .",
    "theorem  [ thm : onelclass ] strengthens a result in which anderson proved persistence of weakly reversible systems with exactly one linkage class under the assumption that all trajectories are bounded  @xcite .",
    "our approach was significantly influenced by distillation of ideas from anderson s result , combined with insights gained from  @xcite .",
    "the class of dynamical systems considered here includes those known as generalized mass - action systems , or power - law systems , studied in biochemical systems theory  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we prove our results here in the more general setting of mass - action differential inclusions , which we introduced in earlier work  @xcite . the crucial result from @xcite applied here ( in section  [ s : results ] ) concerns families of differential inclusions that are closed under certain projections , allowing us to analyze a system in terms of systems of lower dimension .    in the course of this work ( section  [ s : extbirch ] ) , we prove two extensions of birch s theorem , a well - known result in reaction network theory  @xcite and algebraic statistics  @xcite concerning intersections of certain affine spaces and manifolds parametrized by monomials ( theorems  [ t : birch ] and  [ t : birchrestated ] ) .",
    "we show that birch s theorem remains true under slight perturbation ( theorem  [ thm : extbirch ] ) , and at infinity in suitable compactifications ( theorem  [ t : birchext1 ] ) .    to connect the combinatorial ( polyhedral ) geometry of a reaction diagram to the asymptotics of its dynamics ( section  [ s : jet ] ) , we develop jets and toric jets ( definition  [ d : jet ] ) , in parallel with the notion of `` jet frame '' from work by miller and pak @xcite on unfolding convex polyhedra .",
    "jets capture motion the bulk of which proceeds in a fixed main direction , but is perturbed to first order in an orthogonal direction , to second order in a third direction , and so on .",
    "jets coherently tease apart the contributions of various reactions to the gradient of pseudo - helmholtz free energy along infinite trajectories  ( proposition  [ p : domination ] ) .",
    "birch s theorem and jets come together ( in section  [ s : prelya ] ) to show that for strongly endotactic networks , within each stoichiometric compatibility class there exists a compact set outside of which the pseudo - helmholtz free energy function @xmath1 decreases along trajectories ( theorem  [ thm : lyfncworks_cpc ] ) . our main results on persistence and permanence , described earlier in this introduction , follow in section  [ s : results ]",
    ".    examples in section  [ s : ex ] illustrate our results and explain the limitations of our approach .",
    "a further extended example in section  [ s : ped_intro ] serves to introduce the main ideas , after which we give precise , general definitions concerning reaction networks and their accompanying mass - action differential inclusions ( section  [ s : crnt ] ) .",
    "various conjectures related to the gac , along with known partial results , are collected in section  [ s : conjs ] .",

    "the function @xmath18 decreases along the trajectory indicated in blue , but this trajectory is not even persistent  that is , at least one coordinate ( in this case , the @xmath19-coordinate ) approaches zero .    nevertheless , claim  [ claim : ex ] is enough to establish that the origin @xmath20 is repelling ( definition  [ d : persistent_permanent].2 ) and that all trajectories of   are bounded . these two properties , along with good behavior under projection , suffice to obtain our desired permanence result .",

    ", the blue trajectory depicted here can not be a trajectory  of  .",
    "our explanation of claim  [ claim : ex ] involves a `` proof by picture '' .",
    "_ concentration space _ refers to the space in which the trajectories of the dynamical system   evolve , excluding points where @xmath2 or  @xmath3 has concentration zero ; thus concentration space is @xmath11 .",
    "_ energy space _ has coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so energy space is ( another ) @xmath23 .",
    "concentration space and energy space are diffeomorphic via the lie group isomorphism @xmath24 .",
    "this map sends the identity @xmath25 to the origin @xmath20 , and the curve parametrized by @xmath26 in concentration space to the ray from the origin in direction @xmath27 in energy space : @xmath28 such curves in concentration space , obtained by exponentiating rays in energy space , are central to our analysis .",
    "the curve parametrized by @xmath29 is the _ toric ray _ in direction  @xmath27 .",
    "[ r : exponentiation ] in lie theory or differential geometry , the inverse map from energy space to concentration space is the usual exponential map from the tangent space at the identity @xmath25 to the group .",
    "thus toric rays are the positive parts of 1-parameter subgroups of concentration space , and they can also be thought of as geodesics .    for every point @xmath30 , the gradient of @xmath18 at @xmath31 is parallel to the direction of the toric ray that passes through that point .",
    "this is because @xmath32 , so that @xmath33    combinatorial information about a reaction network is represented in the _ space of complexes _ by the reaction diagram , which is a geometric representation of the reaction network .",
    "the reaction diagram for network   is depicted here : @xmath34 the reaction @xmath35 , for example , is represented by the arrow from the complex @xmath36 to the complex @xmath37 .",
    "( other authors have sometimes used the term `` space of complexes '' to refer to a real vector space of dimension equal to the number of vertices of the reaction graph .",

    "the right - hand side of the differential equations   consists of a sum in which the summand arising from a reaction of the form @xmath35 is : @xmath38 the relation between concentration space and the space of complexes depicted in figure  [ figrlv ] is central to our analysis .",
    "specifically , along a toric ray parametrized by @xmath39 , the monomial contribution @xmath40 of the reaction @xmath41 equals @xmath42 .",
    "the exponent @xmath43 has a geometric interpretation in the space of complexes as the value of the linear functional @xmath44 at the point @xmath36 .",
    "we now ask : as @xmath45 , which reactions are dominant , that is , which reactions yield the largest - magnitude contribution  ?",
    "the answer is that the dominant reactions are the ones with maximal inner product @xmath43 , because their monomial contributions grow the fastest as @xmath46 and thus overwhelm the lesser monomial contributions .",
    "the directions in which these reactions `` pull '' ( that is , the vector contributions to the differential equations  ) remain unchanged along the toric ray and are given by their _ reaction vectors _ @xmath47 as in  .",

    ", we can analyze separately the contribution to the derivative   of each reaction @xmath35 .",
    "the contribution of such a reaction , from equations   and  , is @xmath55    so far , everything stated above holds for any reaction network with two species , and can be appropriately generalized for more species .",
    "now we appeal to the fact that the reactions in the reaction diagram under consideration `` point inward '' ( i.e. , the network is _ strongly endotactic _ ; see definition  [ d : endotactic].[d : strong_endotactic ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath56 in the contribution   is common to every reaction , so it is not significant to the analysis of the sign of the derivative @xmath50 . on the other hand , the reaction rate constants @xmath57 are significant .",
    "however , it turns out that we can ignore the rate constants , and instead simply analyze @xmath58 which we call the _ pull _ ( see definition  [ d : pull ] ) of the reaction along the toric ray in direction @xmath27 .",
    "details appear in sections  [ s : prelya ] and  [ s : results ] , particularly in the proof of theorem  [ thm : lyfncworks_cpc ] .",
    "suppose we could verify by inspection of the reaction diagram that for every direction @xmath27 , the inner products in the pulls of all dominant reactions along toric rays in direction @xmath27 satisfy the inequality @xmath59 . by compactness of the unit circle , whose points",
    "are thought of as directions , we could choose a uniform cutoff @xmath60 large enough so that along every toric ray , past this cutoff the monomial contributions of dominant reactions overwhelm the contributions of all other reactions .",
    "indeed , we could ensure this even after including the effects of reaction rate constants .",
    "hence , outside the compact set @xmath61 \\big\\ }    \\subseteq { { \\mathbb{r}}_{>0}}^2\\ ] ] in concentration space , the time derivative of  @xmath18 would be negative .",

    ", this fails in precisely three directions , namely , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , consider the direction @xmath64 .",
    "there exist two dominant reactions : one `` sustaining '' reaction @xmath65 with @xmath66 , and another reaction @xmath67 with @xmath68 . the reaction @xmath67 makes no contribution to the derivative of @xmath18 in direction @xmath63",
    ". however , consider a nearby direction @xmath69 for some small @xmath70 . in this direction",
    ", the reaction @xmath67 is now `` draining '' : its pull is strictly greater than @xmath71 .",
    "it is true that if @xmath70 is fixed , then along the toric ray in direction @xmath69 , this reaction is eventually dominated by the sustaining reaction , because its monomial term is now smaller .",
    "however , as @xmath72 gets smaller , the value of the cutoff @xmath60 after which this domination of monomials occurs must become arbitrarily large .",
    "this is problematic , because the compact set @xmath73 requires a single value of  @xmath60 to work as a cutoff for every direction @xmath27 . to accomplish this",
    ", we turn to a second observation : for sufficiently small @xmath70 , the inner product of the reaction vector of with the direction @xmath69 of the toric ray is , although positive , near zero .",
    "a more detailed analysis along these lines , using information from both the monomial and the inner product , accomplishes claim  [ claim : ex ] .",
    "this approach is developed in section  [ s : jet ] via the technology of jets and jet frames .",
    "these allow us to reduce the analysis of the sign of the time derivative of  @xmath18 to a combinatorial calculation on the reaction diagram .",
    "returning to the example , the family of directions @xmath74 as @xmath75 corresponds to the jet frame @xmath76 .",
    "two reactions dominate along the toric ray in direction @xmath63 , namely @xmath77 and @xmath78 . as for the second direction @xmath62 of the jet frame , only the sustaining reaction @xmath78 is dominant in that direction .",
    "the pull of the draining reaction @xmath77 is dominated by the pull of the sustaining reaction @xmath78 in a uniform manner in all directions @xmath74 for small @xmath70 , and that produces the required uniform  cutoff  @xmath60 .    in general , for strongly endotactic reaction networks , along every jet frame",
    "the pull of each draining reaction is dominated by the pull of some sustaining reaction  ( proposition  [ p : domination ] ) .",

    "[ conj : ext_permanence ] every endotactic reaction network is permanent .",

    "the remaining cases for conjecture  [ conj : gac ] are systems of dimension 4 and higher in which steady states lie on faces of dimension at least  1 and codimension at least  2 .",
    "there have been several other recent approaches to persistence - type results .",

    "second , angeli , de leenheer , and sontag gave persistence criteria that allow for differential inclusions and time - varying rate constants ( i.e. , with temperings )  @xcite .",
    "for instance they proved that @xmath198-limit points arising from reaction systems must lie in the relative interior of faces of the positive orthant defined by `` critical siphons '' ; therefore , networks without critical siphons are persistent .",
    "( a  siphon is a subset of the species whose absence is forward - invariant with respect to the dynamics ; see  @xcite for a precise definition of ( critical ) siphon . )",
    "another approach makes use of the theory of monotone systems ; for instance , see the recent works of angeli , de leenheer , and sontag  @xcite , banaji and mierczynski  @xcite , and donnell and banaji  @xcite .",
    "related work has also used the theory of petri nets  @xcite .",
    "additionally , gopalkrishnan proved that every network that violates conjecture  [ conj : persistence ] must exhibit a certain catalytic property  @xcite .",
    "finally , we refer the reader to work by gnacadja @xcite that considered a stronger version of persistence , called `` vacuous persistence '' , which allows for trajectories with initial condition on the boundary of an invariant polyhedron as well as in the relative interior ; he showed that certain enzymatic networks are persistent in this stronger sense .    for mass - action ode systems in which persistence",
    "is difficult to prove directly , it is possible that the system is dynamically equivalent to  that is , gives rise to the same ode system as ",

    "the results in the current work are complementary to those described above : in section  [ s : results ] we resolve conjectures  [ conj : gac][conj : boundedness ] for strongly endotactic networks in the general setting of mass - action differential inclusions .",
    "the class of complex - balanced systems can be extended in a straightforward way to include some power - law systems , by relaxing the requirement of a complex - balanced system that its complexes be nonnegative integer vectors . in this larger setting , our results concerning the gac remain valid .",
