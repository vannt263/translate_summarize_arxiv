    "ngc 6946 is a relatively nearby grand - design spiral galaxy .",
    "it has been classified as having strong nuclear starburst activity @xcite , and the six historical supernova remnants recorded during the past century attest to a high rate of star formation in its spiral arms @xcite .",
    "its face - on aspect provides the opportunity to observe the total x - ray source population of a spiral galaxy and to compare its characteristics with those of other nearby spiral galaxies .    the distance to ngc 6946",
    "is estimated between 5.1 mpc @xcite and 5.9 mpc @xcite .",
    "we adopt 5.9 mpc ( see @xcite ) , so that our luminosity estimates would be reduced by one - quarter for a distance of 5.1 mpc .",
    "the low galactic inclination of ngc 6946 indicates that the preponderance of photoelectric absorption in its direction arises from gas in the milky way . from the extinction maps of @xcite ,",
    "the average hydrogen column density in the direction of ngc 6946 should be n@xmath0 = 3 - 5@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "several recent studies of ngc 6946 have been devoted to its x - ray source , radio source and supernova remnant populations . @xcite and @xcite detected a total of fourteen x - ray sources with _",
    "einstein _ , _ rosat _ and _ asca _ ,",
    "four of which were coincident with entries in the 118-member radio source catalog of @xcite(hereafter ldg ) .",
    "@xcite invoked the simple requirement of a nonthermal radio spectrum to identify 35 members of the ldg catalog that can be considered `` middle - aged '' ( i.e. , @xmath410@xmath5 years ) supernova remnants .",
    "of these , there is only one match with the 27-member optically selected snr catalog of @xcite ; this single coincidence ( hereafter mf16 ) was further identified with the strongest x - ray source in ngc 6946 detected by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use x - ray imaging and spectral data from the _ chandra _ observatory to study the x - ray source population of this face - on spiral galaxy in terms of its logn - logs distribution , spatial distribution , and spectral distribution .",
    "we compare these properties to those of other spiral galaxies with varying star formation rates .",
    "ngc 6946 was observed by the acis instrument aboard the _ chandra observatory _ for approximately 60 ks on september 7 , 2001 .",
    "the 8@xmath6 x 8@xmath6 field - of - view of a single ccd chip allows almost all of the galaxy to be imaged on the back - side - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "the raw data , with photons of pulse - height equivalent to energies below 0.3 kev or above 5 kev removed , are exhibited in figure  [ raw_fig ] .",
    "source identification was done primarily with standard tools in the ciao ( _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ) toolbox .",
    "celldetect is a simple boxcar filter algorithm in the ciao software package that utilizes a variable detection cell size ( i.e. , increasing with angular distance from the telescope aim point to match the telescope point spread function , psf ) that would include at least 80% of the counts from a point source .",
    "we applied the celldetect algorithm to the 0.3 - 5 kev data of figure  [ raw_fig ] , for which the algorithm detected 46 sources at a significance of @xmath73@xmath8 .",
    "we separately applied the same algorithm to the data in several energy bands in order to perform some straightforward comparative diagnostics .",
    "there is a natural break in the x - ray response at 2 kev , which lends itself to defining the 2 - 5 kev band as hard ( h ) .",
    "we have divided the softer x - rays into 0.3 - 0.5 ( vs ) , 0.5 - 1 kev ( s ) and 1 - 2 kev ( m ) .",
    "sources that are detected in the vs band should be foreground sources since the x - ray optical depth through the milky way at 0.5 kev is @xmath43 .",
    "we also utilized the vtpdetect ( voronoi tesselation and percolation ) algorithm , which considers asymmetric pixelation and can be more sensitive than celldetect for point sources at the detection limit in uncrowded fields .",
    "since 1@xmath9 corresponds to 30 pc at a distance of 5.9 mpc , for this study we are more interested in the sensitivity of vtpdetect than in the imaginative way that it might identify extended sources that would be tens or hundreds of pc in size .",
    "vtpdetect identifies 86 sources at @xmath73@xmath8 when applied to the 0.3 - 5 kev fits file of figure  [ raw_fig ] .",
    "visual inspection of the image results in 72 relatively firm identifications ( at least 10 source counts ) .",
    "the typical background expectation in the southwestern portion of the image is less than 1 count , but in the northeast ( where the point spread function is wider and there may be some diffuse emission ) there may be as many as 3 background counts expected . in a separate study , @xcite are considering the extent to which this background might be diffuse emission in the galaxy associated with the hot phase of its interstellar medium .",
    "other sources identified visually at slightly lower statistical confidence have not been included in table  [ detsrcs ] if they were not first objectively identified by celldetect or vtpdetect .",
    "as an imaging spectrometer , the acis detector offers the opportunity to investigate the spatial , spectral and luminosity characteristics of the galactic source population .    although we have not performed a quantitative correlation analysis , visual inspection of the location of the x - ray sources projected on the optical image of ngc 6946 indicates a clear qualitative correlation with the spiral arms ( figure  [ opt_fig ] ) .",
    "a similar association was noted by @xcite for those radio sources that they designated to be `` middle - aged snr '' ( sources selected on the basis of their radio properties to be likely candidates for snr with ages of @xmath410@xmath5 years that are in the adiabatic phases of their expansion ) ; 6 of the 35 sources in their sample are coincident ( within 2@xmath9 ) with one of the 72 x - ray sources catalogued here . it should be noted that since the radio survey selected sources with nonthermal spectra ( thermal radio snrs are indistinguishable from h  ii regions ) , pulsar wind nebula snrs with thermal radio spectra would not have been included in that survey .",
    "interestingly , 8 of the 83 radio sources that do not meet the middle - aged snr criteria were also coincident with x - ray sources .",
    "in particular , source 82 in the ldg radio catalog is coincident with the young remnant of sn1968d and is also identified with an x - ray source of 0.5 - 5 kev luminosity @xmath43@xmath110@xmath10 ( d@xmath11)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to the distribution of the middle - aged radio snr , the 27 optically - selected snr of @xcite were not particularly well - correlated with the young stellar population of the spiral arms ; here mf16 is the only member of the sample that has an x - ray counterpart .",
    "the results of fits to the spectra of all those sources for which we have @xmath7300 counts are displayed in table 2 .",
    "all of these have inferred luminosities comparable to , or in excess , of the eddington limit for a 1.4 m@xmath14 neutron star ( l@xmath15 = 4@xmath16cgm@xmath17m/@xmath8@xmath18= 1.3@xmath110@xmath19 m / m@xmath14 erg s@xmath13 ) .",
    "since the number of background counts accumulated in each spectrum is typically @xmath2010 , we have not subtracted background in determining these fits .",
    "none of the spectra have the obvious bright k - lines that are associated with the ejecta of young ( 100 - 1000 year old ) supernova remnants in the milky way , although some of the spectra can be described with optically thin thermal models that include less prominent line emission .    of the 32 sources with @xmath740 counts ( @xmath72.8@xmath110@xmath10 ( d@xmath21)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 ) , the general population appears to exhibit featureless `` crab - like '' spectra . comparing the s - m - h counts from each source with those expected from various power law trial spectra , half ( 16 )",
    "are best characterized by 1.5@xmath222.5 , with the other half evenly distributed between softer ( 7 with @xmath232.5 ) and harder ( 9 with @xmath241.5 ) spectra .",
    "the very brightest spectra seem , on average , to be slightly softer ( see table 2 ) .",
    "for source spectra that are not very steep ( i.e. , photon power law index @xmath25 @xmath262 or energy power law index @xmath27 @xmath261 , or models that have characteristic temperatures @xmath28 few tenths of a kev ) , column densities in the range n@xmath29 = 3 - 5@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 typically reduce the source flux in the 0.5 - 5 kev band by about a factor of 2 relative to that which would be detected with n@xmath29 = 0 . using this prescription for typical source spectra ,",
    "the minimum 0.5 - 5 kev source luminosity at 5.9 mpc ( corresponding to 10 counts ) is approximately 7@xmath110@xmath30 ( d@xmath11)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , and the survey should be complete down to approximately 10@xmath10 ( d@xmath11)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "more than a dozen sources have 0.5 - 5 kev luminosities comparable with , or in excess of , the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 m@xmath14 neutron star . using the nearer distance to ngc 6946 would not substantially change this observation .",
    "figure  [ lum_dist ] displays the traditional logn - logs distribution of the integral number of sources n(@xmath7s ) with apparent luminosity greater than s. the unbinned distribution of the 72 sources detected with luminosities @xmath77@xmath110@xmath30 ( d@xmath11)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 is well - fit with a power law index of 0.64@xmath310.02 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "if we confine the fit to luminosities @xmath710@xmath10 ( d@xmath11)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , where we expect that the survey is complete , the fit steepens slightly to 0.68@xmath310.03 .",
    "the logn - logs distribution of the 20 sources with luminosities @xmath77@xmath110@xmath30 ( d@xmath11)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 that are located within 2@xmath6 of the galactic center exhibit a somewhat flatter distribution , with an index 0.51@xmath310.05 .",
    "none of the sources in table  [ detsrcs ] appear to have either very soft ( stellar - like ) spectra or column densities much less than n@xmath29 = 3@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 , so that all can either be associated with ngc 6946 or are background galaxies or agn . using the 0.7 - 2 kev logn - logs relationship of @xcite , which nicely overlaps the region of sensitivity for the sources that we detect in ngc 6946",
    ", we expect that the source list of table  [ detsrcs ] should be contaminated with approximately 2 background sources .",
    "these contaminating galaxies would typically have the relatively hard spectra characteristic of agn , but young pulsar - driven supernova remnants or x - ray binaries in ngc 6946 could have similarly hard spectra .",
    "the x - ray source coincident with mf16 is the brightest x - ray source that we observe in ngc 6946 , with 0.5 - 5 kev luminosity that we estimate to be approximately 8@xmath110@xmath32 ( d@xmath33)@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , based upon the two - component bremsstrahlung fit that is consistent with the average column density in the direction of ngc 6946 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the luminosity estimated by @xcite from data taken with _",
    "rosat _ , but less than that estimated by @xcite from data taken with _ asca _",
    "( where the higher luminosity estimate might have arisen from over - correcting for the broad _ asca _ point spread function ) . without clear evidence for a secular decrease in the mf16 luminosity , we shall assume that all three results are consistent with a constant source luminosity over ten years .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the morphology of mf16 region revealed by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite could imply that the x - ray emission arises from the collision of shock fronts associated with multiple supernovae .",
    "the feature upon which this supposition rests is approximately 1@xmath9 in angular extent , which implies a blast wave cavity tens of pc in size . to traverse this distance , a blast wave of velocity 10@xmath5",
    "km s@xmath13 would require @xmath710@xmath5 years , an age at which snr blast waves are generally well past their free - expansion phases , and well past the times at which they would have exhibited their maximum luminosities .",
    "the 0.5 - 5 kev luminosity of mf16 is almost three orders of magnitude more than that of the brightest young blast wave remnants like cas a.    it might be possible to explain the high luminosity in terms of a transient phase in the cooling , where the sn shock wave is depositing its kinetic energy into a dense ambient medium , since the emission measure is proportional to the square of the density .",
    "such a scenario for this source has been suggested by @xcite , who argue that the characteristics of the source can be explained by supernova ejecta expanding into a dense nitrogen - rich circumstellar nebula created by the high - mass progenitor .",
    "however , as noted by the same authors , this can not be the complete picture , since the spectrum measured by the _",
    "proportional counter requires a non - thermal contribution , perhaps from a pulsar or a pulsar wind nebula ( or a superposition of more than one pwn ) .",
    "moreover , the optically inferred blast wave velocity is less than 1000 km / s . with the current _ chandra _ data ,",
    "we see that the spectrum of mf16 is indisputably deficient in the line emission expected from an interaction with a dense csm , although such a component could make a minor contribution to the overall spectrum .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of mf16 has excellent statistics , containing several thousand counts .",
    "the lack of pronounced spectral features ( such as the dominant k - lines that are characteristic of young blast - wave remnants ) do not demand a unique model , and the spectrum can be fit equally well with a variety of models that sum two or more continuum components .",
    "one example is shown in figure  [ mf16_spec ] .",
    "this composite of a power law and thermal plasma ( mekal in the jargon of the xspec fitting routine that was used here ) might be consistent with a pulsar wind nebula and the interaction of the blast wave with a dense circumstellar shell , but both components are associated with unusually high luminosities that are not easily explained . moreover , it is not the only model that gives an acceptable fit , and the two - component bremsstrahlung model has a higher column density that might better represent the unabsorbed continuum .",
    "the problem with the bremsstrahlung model is that it requires a very low ionization age to suppress the line emission , which is not expected for a remnant that has been interacting with a dense circumstellar medium for at least the 10 years over which observations of this source have been made .",
    "we find no evidence for the companion source that was reported by @xcite at a level of 7% that of mf16 and at an angular distance 30@xmath9 from it . with no indication of a source at this position ,",
    "its current level of emission must be at least an order of magnitude weaker than when detected by schlegel , blair , and fesen , indicating that the missing source is likely to be a variable x - ray binary .",
    "in the region of the galactic center , there are no sources coincident with the j2000 nuclear position ra=308.7201 , dec=60.1538 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite place the dynamical center some 5@xmath9 west of the cotton , condon , and arbizzani position , coincident with the k@xmath6 peak reported by @xcite .",
    "two strong x - ray sources in the galactic center region are detected by the algorithms described in section 2 , with the stronger source located @xmath42@xmath9 south of the weaker .",
    "a third , much weaker source 11@xmath9 to the east is not detected by the algorithms ( and not included in table  [ detsrcs ] ) , although a fourth , yet weaker source to its south is detected , being far enough from the bright central region to be unaffected by the response of the telescope to other sources .",
    "the bright source lies @xmath42.7@xmath9 ne ( position angle @xmath460 degrees e from n ) from the dynamical center of carignan et al . and @xmath48.3@xmath9 w from the cotton et al . center .",
    "both strong sources have spectra that are well - fit with power laws of energy index @xmath25 @xmath41.4 with the same column density .",
    "this suggests the possibility that there may remain some contamination of our spectrum of the smaller by the larger , in spite of the fact that the two sources appear to be almost resolved ; it could also indicate that the two sources have similar origins in the star - forming nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the combination of the two sources appears very much like the morphology observed in both the co image of @xcite and the h alpha image of @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ nuc_fig_exp ] ) .",
    "the co `` molecular bar '' is a roughly rectangular structure of dimensions approximately 60@xmath9 by 12@xmath9 including the central k@xmath6 ( and h alpha ) peak of fig .",
    "[ nuc_fig_exp ] at a position angle of @xmath4135@xmath34 e of n.    a similar central double source is found in a j@xmath35k image of the galactic center of ngc 6946 @xcite , but the sources are not coincident with the two strong central x - ray sources ( see figure  [ nuc_fig ] or  [ nuc_fig_exp ] ) .",
    "in fact , there is no correlation between the 14 j@xmath35k hot spots and the x - ray sources that we detect in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the positions of the j - k hot spots , presumably associated with h  ii regions , are shown overlaid as circles on the chandra image in figure  [ nuc_fig ] .",
    "the positions of the h  ii regions are inferred from the nuclear position given in the caption to figure 11 of @xcite , and are plotted twice : with squares using the cotton et al .",
    "center , and with circles using the carignan et al . center .",
    "although not easily discernible in figure  [ nuc_fig ] , but more easily visible in the contours of figure  [ nuc_fig_exp ] , extended emission is present to the north and to the south ; we are certain that this emission does not originate from the wings of the point spread function because it does not exhibit the psf symmetry . using the carignan et al .",
    "position , the contours surround the nuclear h ii region and the extended emission falls along the curve connecting the northern arm in the j@xmath35k image to the southern j@xmath35k extension . using the cotton et al .",
    "position , the contours lie w of the j@xmath35k center region and do not correspond to any structure in the j@xmath35k image .",
    "luminous ( @xmath710@xmath30 erg s@xmath13 ) x - ray sources are most commonly degenerate stars accreting mass from non - degenerate companions in binary systems",
    ". the degenerate component of these binaries is typically a neutron star , since white dwarfs have insufficient surface gravity to provide luminous x - ray emission from accretion and stellar black holes in binaries appear to be relatively scarce .",
    "the masses of the non - degenerate binary components are used to classify x - ray binaries as high mass ( hmxbs ) or low mass ( lmxbs ) , with the boundary in the relatively sparsely populated mass region of a few solar masses .",
    "the x - ray lmxb and hmxb populations have now been characterized in several spiral galaxies , including the milky way .",
    "lmxbs have a dynamical lifetime ( during which the system is not always x - ray - luminous ) of order 10@xmath36 years , while the lifetime of hmxbs can not exceed the nuclear timescale of the high mass components of the binary systems , or about 10@xmath37 years .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the hmxb luminosity of spiral galaxies exceeds the luminosity arising from lmxbs when the star formation rates ( sfrs ) exceed about 0.005 m@xmath14 per year .",
    "x - ray luminous supernova remnants primarily arise from the same population of progenitors as hmxbs , but typically account for no more than a few percent of the hmxb luminosity @xcite .",
    "the timescales suggest that hmxbs and snrs should be associated with star - forming regions in spiral arms and starburst nuclei , while lmxbs should be more uniformly distributed throughout the galactic bulges and haloes .",
    "@xcite have confirmed that the distribution of x - ray binaries in the milky way conform to this general conventional wisdom , i.e. , that the hmxbs are largely confined to the spiral arms , and that the lmxbs dominate the bulge ( and total source ) population , while having a larger scale height in the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite have also characterized the logn - logs distributions to be expected from lmxbs and hmxbs .",
    "the logn - logs distribution of hmxbs in both the milky way and in other galaxies of all types seems to have a `` universal '' index of 0.6 ( for the integral distribution ) , with no evidence of a cutoff .",
    "the lmxb slope for the milky way is flatter ( index 0.26 ) at low luminosities , but with a high luminosity cutoff that will steepen the apparent logn - logs precipitously if the low luminosity portion of the population is beyond the sensitivity of the survey .",
    "@xcite have suggested that an unbroken logn - logs index for starburst galaxies simply reflects the recent birth rate of hmxbs , while an aging population of lmxbs should exhibit a unit index break to accommodate the removal of sources at a characteristic age from an older population .",
    "recent results show that galaxies with star - forming rates similar to that of the milky way seem to exhibit similar characteristics .",
    "@xcite report a steepening of the logn - logs distribution for the bulge of m81 for l@xmath384@xmath110@xmath10 ergs s@xmath13 from a lower luminosity index of 0.5 .",
    "a similar 0.5 index seems to characterize the disk population , but without a corresponding high luminosity steepening .",
    "it thus appears that the situation is much like that in the milky way , with lmxbs dominating the bulge and with hmxbs playing a larger role in the star - forming regions of the disk .",
    "the average source spectrum is consistent with a power law with @xmath25=1.6 .",
    "m31 seems to demonstrate at least some aspects of the same general behavior as m81 @xcite .",
    "the central region of the galaxy exhibits the high luminosity steepening characteristic of domination by lmxbs , while the outer regions of the galaxy exhibit an index of 1.2 .",
    "while this is considerably steeper than 0.6 , @xcite assign an origin in faint hmxbs to this population since the low luminosity index for lmxbs is even less compatible with the low luminosity index of lmxbs .",
    "@xcite report an average source spectrum consistent with a power law with @xmath25=1.7 .",
    "in contrast , the results reported here for ncg 6946 , i.e. , for the entire galaxy ( index 0.64 ) and for the central 2@xmath6 containing the starburst nucleus ( 0.51 ) , are in good agreement with the expected 0.6 for hmxbs . the slightly flatter slope for the @xmath72@xmath6 distribution may reflect a slightly higher contamination by bright lmxbs .",
    "the global sfr of ngc 6946 is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the milky way , at approximately 4 m@xmath14 yr@xmath13 for stars in the mass range 2 - 60 m@xmath14 @xcite ; most of this is in the outer spiral arms rather than the starburst nucleus .",
    "m83 is a more intense starburst galaxy with a hotter and more compact photodissociation region than ngc 6946 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have reported that the central region surrounding the starburst nucleus has an x - ray logn - logs index of 0.8 ( assumed by those authors to arise from continuous star formation ) , while the outer region is somewhat flatter ( index 0.6 ) at low luminosities ( @xmath206@xmath110@xmath10 ergs s@xmath13)and steeper ( index 1.3 ) at higher luminosities , so that most of the high luminosity population of the galaxy is in the central region .",
    "this might suggest that in m83 the hmxbs dominate the source population only in the central starburst region , rather than in the entire galaxy .",
    "m101 is another face - on spiral galaxy which , like the others discussed above , has a typical h column density through the milky way that is as much as an order of magnitude lower than for ngc 6946 .",
    "the global star formation rate for m101 is very similar to ngc 6946 , at 4.8 m@xmath14 yr@xmath13 , a level about twenty times that of the milky way .",
    "the log n - log s distribution reported by @xcite is relatively flat ( index of 0.8 ) , and the x - ray sources are clearly associated with young population stars through their correlation with the spiral arms .",
    "the distribution of spectral indices for the sources is broad ( per figure 6 of @xcite ) , with an average value similar to that of m81 or m31 .",
    "supersoft sources make up approximately 10% of the m101 sample , but this potential similarity with ngc 6946 can not be tested , because the higher column density in the direction of ngc 6946 prevents their detection .",
    "the global results reported here for ngc 6946 are consistent with the trends discussed above . with an sfr comparable to that of m101 and its characterization as a starburst galaxy",
    ", it should not be surprising that the distribution of x - ray sources in ngc 6946 matches that expected from a population dominated by hmxbs .",
    "the lack of obvious blast - wave snrs may also be expected , in spite of the number of recent sns , for at least two reasons . from the ratio of their x - ray - emitting lifetimes",
    ", the ratio of x - ray luminous snrs to hmxbs originating in the same progenitor sample should be not much more than about 1% . further , and most important in this study",
    ", a detection threshold at the level comparable to the luminosity of the crab nebula will be incapable of detecting any but the very brightest members of the snr population of ngc6946 .",
    "the galactic center region has two luminous x - ray sources close to the dynamical center .",
    "since the luminosity of the southern member of the center pair is an order of magnitude in excess of that for an eddington - limited neutron star , there is the suspicion that it might be associated with a central black hole .",
    "although these two sources seem to fall on the central co and h alpha images of ngc 6946 , the other x - ray sources near galactic center do not cluster in the co molecular bar or correlate in detail with h  ii regions identified by elmegreen et al . in the central star - forming region of the galaxy .",
    "the other ngc 6946 sources that exceed nominal neutron star eddington luminosity can have their explanations in a variety of ways , such as magnetospheric effects around neutron stars , or black holes in place of neutron stars ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have noted that the presence of multiple super - eddington x - ray sources seems to be characteristic of starburst galaxies , in marked contrast to non - starburst spirals .",
    "it is also interesting to note that stellar - mass black holes in the milky way have been identified with hmxbs that exhibit episodic x - ray increases ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , so that we have local empirical evidence for the existence of black holes in hmxbs .",
    "a characteristic of such black hole sources is their spectral variability with luminosity phase ; this latter variation may be the most efficient way to determine the nature of these sources in subsequent x - ray exposures to ngc 6946 .",
    "if they are stellar black holes in hmxbs , the bright sources detected here are likely to be in the `` high '' states that usually exhibit spectra steeper than that of the crab nebula ; in this survey of ncg 6946 the most luminous sources appear to systematically exhibit spectra steeper than that of the crab nebula , at least in the energy range 0.5 - 5 kev .",
    "subsequent exposures to ngc 6946 that provide correlated spectral and intensity variations for these sources could provide the evidence that they are , indeed , black hole hmxbs .    the previous identification of the ultra - luminous source with the supernova remnant mf16 resulted in a plausible explanation for its high luminosity by @xcite in terms of the cooling of a pre - sn circumstellar wind that has been recently heated by the sn blast wave ( although it did not appear that it would be fully adequate and these authors suggested a possible additional pulsar component ) . a similar scenario had been invoked by @xcite to explain the detection of x - ray emission from sn1988z 6.5 years after outburst with the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( which has no energy resolution ) at an inferred x - ray luminosity of @xmath410@xmath39 ergs s@xmath13 .",
    "the lack of prominent line emission in the current data is difficult to reconcile with this model , however .",
    "it is possible to contrive scenarios with pre - ionized circumstellar material to suppress line emission , but high luminosity arising from bremsstrahlung emission at high density will result in rapid cooling to temperatures at which x - ray line emission will be prominent .",
    "the apparent constancy of the luminosity for at least a decade and the lack of line emission argue against this being a complete explanation .",
    "it may well be that the ultra - luminous source in ngc6946 has its ultimate explanation in a very unusual , if not a unique , set of circumstances .",
    "one possibility that might appear to have a relatively simple set of contrivances is a short - period pulsar with a high surface magnetic field .",
    "the 0.5 - 5 kev luminosity of the crab nebula , with a central pulsar having a rotation period of 33 ms and an inferred surface magnetic field of the order of 10@xmath40 gauss , is approximately three orders of magnitude lower than that of mf16 . since the loss of pulsar rotational kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the surface field and the inverse fourth power of the period , a factor of three in both of these parameters relative to those of the crab pulsar could provide a factor of 10@xmath41 in luminosity .",
    "there are some obvious difficulties with this simple picture , however .",
    "there are no reported high - field pulsars with short periods or short - period spin - down pulsars with high fields ( the fastest period for a pulsar in a remnant is 16 ms in n157b , with an inferred magnetic field of order 10@xmath42 gauss , @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of a crab - like gamma - ray source at the position of ngc 6946 @xcite is not particularly troublesome , since the distance to ngc 6946 would reduce the simple scaling of a source with gamma - ray luminosity 10@xmath41 that of the crab nebula to an apprarent luminosity of only 10@xmath43 .",
    "a more serious difficulty with this explanation is that it demands a very young pulsar ; we can not sustain a very short pulsar period with a high luminosity that is the direct consequence of pulsar rotational energy loss .",
    "the implied characterisitic age for such a pulsar would be about 150 years , which is inconsistent with optical loop sizes of tens of pc and optical shock velocities of 600 km / s .",
    "we might reinvoke multiple sn to explain the optical characteristics of the region into which this anomalously bright pulsar was recently introduced , but the same coincidence could just have easily provided the setting for a hmxb with a massive stellar black hole .",
    "future observations of the secular variation of the source intensity and/or spectrum should provide additional clues to the nature of this source .",
    "we have utilized the _ chandra _ acis imaging spectrometer to investigate the source population of the face - on galaxy ngc 6946 .",
    "the gross aspects of the spatial and luminosity distributions of the source population suggest that hmxbs may play a significantly more important role here ( relative to lmxbs ) than in the milky way , consistent with the much higher sfr in ngc 6946 .",
    "although there are strong nuclear sources , including one that may be coincident with the center of the galaxy , there is no clustering of this sample in the co molecular bar or correlation of the central x - ray sources with near ir `` hot spots . ''",
    "the ten brightest sources in the galaxy appear to exceed the eddington luminosity for a neutron star , and the very brightest , previously identified with a supernova remnant ( mf16 ) , exceeds it by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the most straightforward conjecture for the nature of all of these strong sources is that they are hmxbs with black hole degenerate members . in the case of mf16",
    ", the lack of strong x - ray emission lines in its x - ray spectrum suggests that the major fraction of its luminosity can not be reconciled with traditional collisional models for the x - ray emission from supernova remnants .",
    "thanks to olin undergraduate students polina segalova , jessica anderson , anne marie rynning and nicholas zola for help with data extraction and analysis during the early phases of this study . the research of ems was supported by contract number nas8 - 38073 to sao for the chandra x - ray center .",
