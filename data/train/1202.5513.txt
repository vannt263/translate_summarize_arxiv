    "the field @xmath0 is therefore the maximum magnetic field at which a type - ii superconductor can remain in a true non - dissipative state not altered by dissipative motion of vortices .",
    "in addition to the fundamental interest in what limits @xmath0 in superconductors , there is a strong interest in the physics of @xmath0 promoted by recent advances in superconducting nb cavities for particle accelerators in which the quality factors @xmath15 at 2k and 2ghz were observed up to the surface rf fields close to the thermodynamic critical field @xmath16 mt of nb .",
    "@xcite here the rf frequency is well below the gap frequency @xmath17 ghz for nb where @xmath11 is the superconducting gap , so the current pairbreaking in the cavities at low temperatures may occur under quasi - static conditions .",
