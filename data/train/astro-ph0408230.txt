    "the supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) observation and the cosmic microwave background power spectrum measurement show the existence of dark energy and the flatness of the universe @xcite . in order to understand the nature of dark energy ,",
    "many dynamical models have been proposed , such as , quintessence , tachyon , k - essence , etc .",
    "@xcite . a cosmological",
    "constant is the simplest model of dark energy , but no natural explanation for the origin of it can be given .",
    "the sne ia observations provide the currently most direct way to probe the dark energy through the luminosity - distance relation @xcite .    in order to probe the evolution of dark energy , an appropriate and simple parametrization of them",
    "can take the advantage of being practical @xcite . despite the broad interest in proposing dynamical model of dark energy , their physical properties",
    "are still poorly understood at a fundamental level .",
    "as well known , almost all models of dark energy can fit to the observation data , but few models fitting well to the evolution of the universe in a very long history have been found . from a phenomenological point of view",
    "all known models of dark energy should be equivalent .",
    "we still have a long way from being able to give a complete explanation for the nature of dark energy .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to try to seek an appropriate form of solution to friedmann equation independent of the concrete dark energy model .",
    "recently , we propose a power - law expansion universe model @xcite , @xmath6 with @xmath7 , which for a spatially flat , isotropic and homogeneous universe leads to the consistent results with those given in some current researches such as @xcite . here , the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be determined by fitting the evolution of the universe from the sne data .",
    "the three cases are discussed , among which the best one has the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the model with the three best parameters predicts @xmath14 , favors the phantom dark energy for the current universe , and show the total energy density of the universe is decreasing .",
    "in order to describe the the universe transition from deceleration to acceleration expansion we propose such a universe model described by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scale factor for @xmath17 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 are three nonnegative parameters @xcite . from ( [ scale ] ) , there is @xmath18 , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a dot stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath19 . giving the observed quantities , the current hubble parameter @xmath0 , the current deceleration parameter @xmath20 and the age of the universe @xmath1 ,",
    "then we have @xmath21 in order to determine @xmath9 and @xmath10 , one needs to know @xmath22 , and choose the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath8 .",
    "fixing @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using the different values of @xmath20 and @xmath8 , then one can obtain the diffeent @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which yield different transition redshift @xmath24 . by adopting @xmath25 , then we can determine the values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "the improvement to our previous method is that we will not only require the model can describe the universe transition but hope that it may track the histoty of the universe evolution . from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , one can have @xmath26 .",

    "[ f1 ] shows @xmath27 curves with the same minimum for the three special cases with different values of @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "[ f2 ] gives the comparison between @xmath28 curves given from the sne ia data @xcite and fig .",
    "we find that among the three cases the third one ( c ) , i.e. , the curve with @xmath3 and @xmath12 can best fit to the evolution curve from the sne ia data .",
    "this implies that the model predicts the deceleration parameter of the universe @xmath4 .",
    "this value is bigger than some known results , such as , @xmath29 given in @xcite , but may be consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "now , we determine the universe transition redshift . putting @xmath3 and @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) yields @xmath13 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . using equation ( 8) in @xcite and letting @xmath33",
    ", then we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the transition time .",
    "equation ( [ eq - q ] ) yields @xmath37 , and from the relation @xmath38 we have the transition redshift @xmath39 which may be consistent with some known results , such as those given in @xcite .    in this section , by fitting to the sne data we determine the parameters in the power - law expanding universe model with ( @xmath11 , @xmath30 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "next , using the scale factor ( [ scale ] ) with known parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 we will catch a glimpse of the evolution of dark energy and the universe .",
    "for the spatially flat , isotropic and homogeneous universe described by the scale factor ( [ scale ] ) , the total energy density is determined by @xmath40 with @xmath41 the reduced planck mass .",
    "assuming that the matter component is the perfect fluid , i.e. , @xmath42 , then the dark energy density is given by @xmath43 .",

    "3 shows the phantom property of dark energy at the current epoch and fig .",
    "4 shows the minimum of hubble parameter @xmath54 @xmath55 at @xmath56 @xmath49 , which yields the minimum of universe energy density @xmath57 .    from the conserved equation for dark energy @xmath58 where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to time ,",
    "one can obtain the equation of state @xmath59 assuming that the dark energy is slowly changing , then around the current epoch we can approximately have @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath63 @xmath64 , there are the energy density ratio @xmath65 , which lead to @xmath66 for @xmath46 , respectively",
    ".    from the friedmann equations @xmath67 one can have @xmath68 with @xmath69t^{m-2}-n_0t^{-2}$ ] and @xmath70 .",
    "5 illustrates the future evolution of dark energy , which will evolve to its minimum in the time interval @xmath71 @xmath49 , such as , @xmath72 at @xmath73 @xmath49 for @xmath74 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 may be neglected and for @xmath11 equation ( [ eqde ] ) reduces to @xmath77 which implies that @xmath52 decreases rapidly to @xmath78 for late time .",
    "for the constant equation of state @xmath79 , the universe will encounter the sudden future singularity @xcite , i.e. , big rip or big smash , but it may evade a big rip if the the equation of state falls off quickly @xcite .",
    "clearly , the power - law expansion universe model considered currently describe such a phantom universe without the future singularity .",
    "we study the power - law model with time - dependent power proposed in @xcite by using the sne data . for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", the model can well track the evolution of the supernova to a very high redshift , and the predicted transition reashift @xmath24 and deceleration parameter @xmath20 may be consistent with some known results @xcite .",
    "the model may be expected to be able to describe the future evolution of the universe in the near future since it can well track the past evolution history of the universe .",
    "considering the matter as the perfect fluid , then the model predicts that the equation of state parameter for dark energy is decreasing and will go to its minimum value after about @xmath80 @xmath49 for @xmath81 .",
    "another interesting result given by the model is that the total energy density of universe is dropping and will soon approach its minimum value smaller slightly than the current one .",
    "obtaining a overall scale factor from a dark energy model should be what everyone yearns , who is working in this research realm .",
    "however , it is a pity that there are few models which can track a very long evolution history of the universe by fitting the observation data at one point .",
    "so , studying the scale factor in a direct way does nt interpret the nature of dark energy but should be very helpful for understanding the behavior of dark energy .",
