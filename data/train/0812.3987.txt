    "<S> see e.g.  @xcite . although the list of possible dark matter candidates is long , it is fair to say that the most popular dark matter particle is the lsp in supersymmetric models with r - parity conservation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superpartners that have the right properties for playing the role of cold dark matter in the universe are the axino , the gravitino and the lightest neutralino . by far the most discussed case in the literature </S>",
    "<S> is the case of the neutralino ( see the classical review  @xcite ) , probably because of the prospects of possible detection .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , primordial big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is one of the cornerstones of modern cosmology . in the old days , </S>",
    "<S> bbn together with hubble s law and cmb supported and strengthened the hot big - bang idea . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , bbn can be used to test and constrain possible new physics beyond the standard model . although the general agreement between the theoretical predictions and the observed light nuclei abundances is quite impressive , it is true that that there is a discrepancy between the standard theory and lithium isotopes observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was proposed that the so called catalyzed bbn can reconcile the aforementioned discrepancy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider a heavy unstable negatively charged particle @xmath0 which can form coulomb bound states together with helium 4 . </S>",
    "<S> then the following reaction @xmath1 can affect the primordial light element abundances substantially . </S>",
    "<S> the lithium 6 observations can constrain the properties of @xmath0 , and in particular its lifetime  @xcite .    in cmssm the lightest neutralino or </S>",
    "<S> the lightest stau is typically the lightest superpartner . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in scenarios in which gravitino is assumed to be the lsp , then the neutralino or the stau is the nslp and therefore unstable with a lifetime which is typically larger than bbn time @xmath2  sec . </S>",
    "<S> energetic particles produced by the nlsp decay may dissociate the background nuclei and significantly affect the primordial abundances of the light elements . </S>",
    "<S> if such processes occur with sizable rates , the predictions of the standard bbn scenario are altered and the success of the primordial nucleosynthesis is spoiled . </S>",
    "<S> bbn constraints on cosmological scenarios with exotic long - lived particles predicted by physics beyond the standard model have been studied  @xcite , and the neutralino nlsp scenario is already disfavored  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the stau nlsp is still a viable scenario , and in this case the stau can play the role of the heavy unstable negatively charged particle @xmath0 .    in the present article we work in the msugra model and </S>",
    "<S> assume that the gravitino is the lsp while the stau is the nlsp . </S>",
    "<S> gravitino plays the role of cold dark matter in the universe while the stau plays the role of @xmath0 to catalyze bbn . in the cmssm , </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the mssm , there is a small controllable number of parameters , namely four parameters and a sign . these are    * universal gaugino masses @xmath3 * universal scalar masses @xmath4 * universal trilinear couplings @xmath5 * @xmath6 + where @xmath7 are the vevs of the higgs doublets and @xmath8 is the grand unification scale .    plus </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the @xmath9 parameter from the higgs sector . in msugra </S>",
    "<S> there is the additional condition for the gravitino mass , @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the neutralino and stau masses depend on the universal scalar and gaugino mass as follows  @xcite @xmath11 from the above formulas we can easily see the two limits in which either neutralino or stau is the lightest of the usual superpartners . in the limit in which @xmath12 , the stau mass @xmath13 and in this case the neutralino is lighter than stau . in the limit in which @xmath14 , the stau mass @xmath15 and in this case the stau is lighter than the neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> the natural range for values of @xmath16 is from @xmath17  gev up to a few tev , and following  @xcite we shall consider for @xmath16 the range @xmath18 for the gravitino abundance we take all possible production mechanisms into account and impose the cold dark matter constraint  @xcite @xmath19 at this point it is convenient to define the gravitino yield , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gravitino number density , @xmath22 is the entropy density for a relativistic thermal bath , and @xmath23 counts the relativistic degrees of freedom . the gravitino abundance @xmath24 in terms of the gravitino yield is given by @xmath25 where we have used the values @xmath26 the total gravitino yield has three contributions , namely one from the thermal bath , one from the nlsp decay , and one more from heavy moduli decay . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 the contribution from the thermal production has been computed in  @xcite . in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the gravitino production was computed in leading order in the gauge coupling @xmath28 , in  @xcite the thermal rate was computed in leading order in all standard model gauge couplings @xmath29 , and in  @xcite new effects were taken into account , namely : a ) gravitino production via gluon @xmath30 gluino @xmath31 gravitino and other decays , apart from the previously considered @xmath32 gauge scatterings , b ) the effect of the top yukawa coupling , and c ) a proper treatment of the reheating process . here we shall use the result of  @xcite since the corrections of  @xcite do not alter our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the thermal gravitino production is given by @xmath33 the second contribution to the gravitino abundance comes from the decay of the nlsp @xmath34 with @xmath35 the gravitino mass , @xmath36 the mass of the nlsp ( here the stau ) and @xmath37 the nlsp abundance had it did not decay into the gravitino , which for the stau is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath38 the decay width of stau to tau and gravitino is given by  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the reduced planck mass . in the limit in which @xmath41 the stau lifetime is simplified as follows @xmath42 according to the results of  @xcite , the catalyzed bbn imposes on the stau lifetime the upper bound @xmath43 using that @xmath10 , @xmath44 , and the expression for the stau lifetime we obtain @xmath45 on the other hand , the catalyzed bbn only works if the lifetime of the @xmath0 particle is larger than a certain value @xmath46 or @xmath47 for example , if @xmath48 , then @xmath16 takes values within the interval @xmath49 the last contribution to the gravitino abundance comes from a heavy modulus decay . </S>",
    "<S> moduli are four - dimensional scalar fields with a potential , and they appear from higher dimensional supergravity / superstring theories upon compactification down to four dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> moduli parameterize the shape and size of the manifold used for compactificationand , and typically their vaccum expectation value is of the order of the planck mass @xmath50 . finally , generically and without fine - tuning their mass is close to the gravitino mass . </S>",
    "<S> for example in the kklt model  @xcite one finds that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the total volume modulus . </S>",
    "<S> however , with fine tuning it is possible to have a heavy modulus and an arbitrarily light gravitino  @xcite . the gravitino yield from modulus decay </S>",
    "<S> is given by  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the reheating temperature at the modulus decay , @xmath55 is the modulus mass , @xmath56 is the total decay rate of the modulus , and @xmath57 is the modulus decay rate to a pair of gravitinos . using the supergravity lagrangian </S>",
    "<S> one can compute both @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the modulus dominantly decays into gauge bosons and gauginos with a total decay width  @xcite @xmath58 while the decay width into a pair of gravitinos is given by  @xcite @xmath59 in the limit in which @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the branching ratio for the decay channel into a gravitino pair is given by @xmath61 we assume that the modulus dominates the energy density when it decays and thus it reheats the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the reheating temperature at the modulus decay is determined as usual by the condition @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the hubble parameter as a function of the temperature during the radiation era . </S>",
    "<S> thus one finds @xmath64 or @xmath65 notice that @xmath54 is determined entirely by the modulus mass . from bbn </S>",
    "<S> there is a lower bound on the reheating temperature , coming from the requirement that at bbn time all three neutrino species are thermalized  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this limit reads @xmath66 which in turn induces a lower bound on modulus mass @xmath67 for given values of gravitino mass and stau mass , the total gravitino abundance is a function of the modulus mass . in figure  1 </S>",
    "<S> we show the gravitino abundance as a function of modulus mass for @xmath68  gev and @xmath69  tev , while in figure  2 we show the gravitino abundance versus the modulus mass for @xmath68  gev and @xmath70  tev . in both figures </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal strip shows the allowed range for cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the figures show that gravitino can explain the cold dark matter in the universe provided that the modulus mass is of the order of @xmath71 , which is obviously in contradiction to the limit @xmath72  gev . apart from that , </S>",
    "<S> since the modulus field decays into two gravitinos , kinematics requires that @xmath73  gev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for these two reasons we conclude that the scenario under investigation must be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> finally , if we consider larger values of @xmath35 we find that the situation becomes even worse . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the nlsp decay increases and therefore the modulus mass must be lower than before </S>",
    "<S> .    we remark in passing that if the gravitino mass is treated as one extra parameter and can be low enough , then it possible to satisfy both the cold dark matter constraint and the lower bound on the modulus mass . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in figure  3 we show the gravitino abundance versus the modulus mass for a light gravitino , @xmath74  gev , and @xmath75  gev . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the gravitino abundance is within the allowed observational range provided that the modulus mass is @xmath76  gev , which satisfies the limit @xmath72  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that if the scenario under investigation is to be realized in nature , then the gravitino must be light or , put it differently , the correct supersymmetry breaking pattern might be the gauge mediated one  @xcite .    in summary , in the present work we have studied supersymmetric dark matter in msugra assuming that the gravitino is the lsp and that the stau is the nlsp . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitino plays the role of cold dark matter in the universe , while the stau catalyzes the standard bbn reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and observations on cosmic lithium isotopes observations . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken into account all three gravitino production mechanisms and have imposed the cold dark matter constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the production mechanisms for the gravitino are i ) a heavy modulus decay , ii ) the nlsp ( stau ) decay , and iii ) scattering processes from the thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the modulus dominates the energy density when it decays and reheats the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the reheating temperature is determined entirely by the modulus mass . </S>",
    "<S> constraints from bbn impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature and in turn a lower bound on the modulus mass , @xmath72  gev . on the other hand , if we compute the total gravitino abundance and impose the cold dark matter constraint we find that the modulus mass should be much lower than the above lower limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the scenario under investigation must be excluded . </S>"
