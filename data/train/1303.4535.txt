    "since the first discovery of a transiting planet around hd  209458 @xcite , 235 transiting extrasolar systems have already been confirmed up to december 4th , 2012 . whilst transiting exoplanets offer unique scientific possibilities , their study involves several complications . in general , it is impossible to measure the mass and radius of a planet based on a dataset obtained with one observational technique .",
    "transit light curves allow us to determine just the relative size of a star and planet , the orbital inclination and the stellar limb - darkening coefficients . by combining this with radial - velocity measurements ,",
    "the observations offer the opportunity to measure the precise stellar and planetary parameters . in order to obtain such parameters ,",
    "some constraints are needed , and are usually provided by forcing the properties of the host stars to match theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "significant uncertainties remain in the stellar mass and radius determinations of many systems . in some cases , this is due to poorly determined photospheric properties ( i.e. effective temperature and metallicity ) , and in other cases due to a lack of an accurate luminosity estimate @xcite .",
    "in addition , the different methods used for these determinations as well as different approaches toward systematic errors are leading to rather inhomogeneous set of planet properties .",
    "because of such inhomogenities , recently a few papers were published where authors re - analyzed a large subset of known transiting planets , and applied a uniform methodology to all systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper we focus on the transiting system tres-3 .",
    "the system consists of a nearby g - type dwarf and a massive hot jupiter with an orbital period of 1.3 days .",
    "it was discovered by @xcite and also detected by the superwasp survey @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite presented new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the host star . a detailed abundance analysis based on high - resolution spectra yields [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.19 @xmath3 0.08 , @xmath4  =  5650 @xmath3 75  k and log  @xmath5  =  4.0  @xmath3  0.1 .",
    "the spectroscopic orbital solution was improved with new radial velocity measurements obtained by @xcite . moreover , these authors redetermined the stellar parameters ( i.e. @xmath6 = 0.928@xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 = 0.829@xmath10 @xmath11 ) and finally , the new values of the planetary mass and radius were determined ( see tab [ tab03 ] ) .",
    "they also studied the transit timing variations ( ttvs ) of tres-3 and noted significant outliers from a constant period . in the same year",
    ", @xcite presented the follow - up transit photometry .",
    "it consisted of nine transits of tres-3 , taken as part of transit timing program using the rise instrument on the liverpool telescope .",
    "these transits , together with eight transit times published before @xcite , were used to place upper mass limit as a function of the period ratio of a potential perturbing planet and transiting planet .",
    "it was shown that timing residuals are sufficiently sensitive to probe sub - earth mass planet in both interior and exterior 2:1 resonances , assuming that the additional planet is in an initially circular orbit . @xcite",
    "has observed tres-3 as a part of the nasa _ epoxi _ mission of opportunity .",
    "they detected a long - term variability in the tres-3 light curve , which may be due to star spots .",
    "they also confirmed that the planetary atmosphere does not have a temperature inversion .",
    "later , @xcite observed nine primary transits of the hot jupiter tres-3b in several optical and near - uv photometric bands from june 2009 to april 2012 in an attempt to detect its magnetic field .",
    "authors determined an upper limit of tres-3b s magnetic field strength between 0.013 and 1.3 g using a timing difference of 138 s derived from the nyquist ",
    "shannon sampling theorem .",
    "they also presented a refinement of the physical parameters of tres-3b , an updated ephemeris and its first published near - uv light curve .",
    "the near - uv planetary radius of @xmath12 = 1.386@xmath13 @xmath14 was also determined .",
    "this value is consistent with the planet s optical radius .",
    "recently , @xcite observed eleven transits of tres-3b over a two year period in order to constrain system parameters and look for transit timing and depth variations .",
    "they also estimated the system parameters for tres-3b and found consistency with previous estimates .",
    "their analysis of the transit timing data show no evidence for transit timing variations and timing measurements are able to rule out super - earth and gas giant companions in low order mean motion resonance with tres-3b .",
    "the main aims of this study can be summarized in the following items : ( i ) determination of the system parameters for tres-3b ( two independent codes will be used ) and comparison with previous studies ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) based on the obtained transits , we will determine the mid - transit times ( @xmath0 ) and with following analysis of transit time variation ( ttv ) we will discuss possible presence of a hypothetical additional planet ( perturber ) .",
    "we will try to estimate its upper - mass limit as a function of orbital periods ratio of transiting planet and the hypothetical perturber .",
    "( iii ) finally , using the long - term integration and applying the method of maximum eccentricity we will search for stability of regions inside the tres-3b planet in context of additional planet(s ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the section  2 ,",
    "we describe observations and data reduction pipelines used to produce the light curves .",
    "section  3 presents the methods for analysis of transit light curves as well as discussion and comparison of the parameters of tres-3 system .",
    "section  4 and 5 are devoted to ttv and long - term stability of the system , respectively .",
    "finally , in section  6 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we obtained our data using several telescopes with different instruments .",
    "this allowed us to obtain many light curves since this strategy can effectively cope with the weather problems . on the other hand",
    ", this approach results in rather heterogeneous data .",
    "we used most of the data in average quality for the ttv analysis which is not very demanding on homogeneity of the data .",
    "only the best quality light curve was used for the planet parameter determination .",
    "observations used in this paper were carried out at the several observatories in slovakia ( star lesn observatory ; 4909 10``n , 2017 28''e ) , poland ( piwnice observatory ; 5305 43``n , 1813 46''e ) , germany ( grossschwabhausen observatory ; 5055 44``n , 1129 03''e ; volkssternwarte kirchheim observatory , 505544``n , 1129 03''e and michael adrian observatory , 495527``n , 0824 33''e ) and spain ( calar alto observatory ; 371325``n , 0232 46''e ) .",
    "we collected 14 transit light curves obtained between may 2009 and september 2011 .",
    "the transits on may 12 , 2009 and august 20 , 2010 were observed simultaneously at two different observatories .",
    "the telescope diameters of 0.5 to 2.2 m allowed us to obtain photometry with 1.2  7.8 mmag precision , depending on observing conditions .",
    "observations generally started @xmath15 1 hour before the expected beginning of a transit and ended @xmath15 1 hour after the event .",
    "unfortunately , weather conditions and schedule constraints meant that we were not able to fit this scheme in all cases .",
    "all instruments are equipped with ccd cameras with the johnson - cousins ( @xmath16 ) standard filter system . the information from individual observatories and instruments as well as the summary of observing runs",
    "are given in table [ tab01 ] and table [ tab02 ] .",
    "the standard correction procedure ( bias , dark and flat field correction ) and subsequently aperture photometry was performed by iraf and task _ chphot _",

    "various aperture radii were used .",

    "our photometric observations of the tres-3 system consist of data from different instruments and are of different photometric quality . for the purpose of radius determination",

    "we first refined the light - curve system parameters and subsequently determined the individual times of transit as described below in order to improve ephemeris .",
    "for the calculation of synthetic light curves we used two independent approaches : the first one is based on the routines from @xcite and the monte carlo simulations ( described in section [ sol1 ] ) , the second one uses jktebop code @xcite ( see section [ jktebop ] ) .",
    "first we used the downhill simplex minimization procedure ( implemented in routine amoeba , @xcite ) to determine @xmath26 system parameters @xmath27 ( planet to star radius ratio ) , @xmath28 ( inclination ) , @xmath0 ( mid - transit time ) and @xmath29 ( star radius to semi - major axis ratio ) .",

    "the parameters and the corresponding light curve for which we found the minimum value of @xmath43 function , are in table 3 and figure 2 , respectively ( _ solution 1 _ ) .    to estimate the uncertainties of the calculated transit parameters , we employed the monte carlo simulation method @xcite .",

    "these findings allow us to conclude that a strictly periodic ttv signal with the amplitude greater than @xmath151 minute over a 4-year time span seems to be unlikely .    following @xcite , we put upper constraints on a mass of a potential perturbing planet in the system with refined assumptions .",
    "we adopted a value of 1 min for the maximal amplitude of the possible ttv signal .",
    "we also increased the sampling resolution to probe resonances other than inner and outer 1:2 commensurabilities studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "we simplified the three - body problem by assuming that the planetary system is coplanar and initial orbits of both planets are circular .",
    "the masses of both the star and the transiting planet , as well as its semi - major axis were taken from @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of the hypothetical perturber was varied in a range between 0.2 and 5 orbital periods of tres-3  b. we produced 2800 synthetic o ",
    "c diagrams based on calculations done with the mercury code @xcite .",
    "we applied the bulirsch ",
    "stoer algorithm to integrate the equations of motion .    , and the hypothetical perturber , @xmath112 .",
    "orbits located in a grey area were found to be unstable due to close encounters of both planets.,width=321 ]    the most important feature of the bulirsch - stoer algorithm for n - body simulations is that it is capable of keeping an upper limit on the local errors introduced due to taking finite time - steps by adaptively reducing the step size when interactions between the particles increase in strength .",
    "calculations covered 1500 days , i.e. a total time span of available transit observations . the results of simulations are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] .",
    "our analysis allows us to exclude an additional earth - mass planet close to inner 1:3 , 1:2 , and 3:5 and outer 5:3 , 2:1 , and 3:1 mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) .",
    "in this section , we investigated the long - term gravitational influence of tres-3b planet on a potential second planet in the system .",
    "thus , we performed numerical simulation for studying the stability of orbits and checking their chaotic behavior using the method of maximum eccentricity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we used long - term integration of small - mass ( earth - mass ) planet orbits for inspecting the stability regions in the tres-3b system .",
    "the time span of the integration was around 140000 revolutions of the planet around the star .",
    "for the integration of this system we again applied an efficient variable - time - step algorithm ( bulirsch - stoer integration method ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath113 which controls the accuracy of the integration was set to @xmath114 , in this case .",
    "we have generated @xmath110 mass - less particles for representing small planets in this system .",
    "we assumed that semi - major axis ranges from 0.00625@xmath1au to 0.1@xmath1au .",
    "the inner border of the generated system of small planets is around 1.5 times star radius .",
    "this value of inner border is approximately at the location of roche limit for a earth - like planet and includes also the region in the vicinity of 3:1 mmr ( 0.01au for this case ) in our analysis .",
    "the step - size in semi - major axis was @xmath115 = 0.00025@xmath1au , in eccentricity @xmath116 = 0.02 and @xmath117 = 5@xmath118 in inclination .",
    "the upper limit of the grid in eccentricity was 0.5 and 50@xmath118 in inclination .",
    "we integrated the orbits of the small planets for the time - span of 500 years ( about 140 000 revolutions of tres-3b around the parent star ) .",
    "we obtained orbital evolution of each small planet in the system and also were able to study the stability regions at the end of the integration using the method of maximum eccentricity , mentioned above . the maximum eccentricity that the potential perturber of tres-3b reached over the time of the integration",
    "is plotted on the @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) stability map in the fig.[fig_ae ] ( fig.[fig_ai ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig_ae ] shows the stability maps in @xmath119 plane for selected values of inclinations : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( from top left to bottom right ) .",
    "also the mmrs with tres-3b planet are marked in these plots .",
    "we can see a stable region inside the 2:1 mmr for each value of inclination . outside the 2:1",
    "mmr the gravitational influence of the tres-3b planet is very strong and leads to depletion of these regions .",
    "only the mmrs 2:1 , 3:2 and 1:1 are moderately populated but the population decreases with the increase of the inclination . for completeness , we note that 5:3 ( @xmath125 0.016au ) and 3:5 ( @xmath125 0.032au ) mmrs are depleted and thus not stable for additional earth - mass planet in their vicinity . in fig.[fig_ai ] we present the stability maps in @xmath120 plane for several values of eccentricities : @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "one can see the stable region inside the 2:1 mmr with tres-3b planet , which we found stable also in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "considering the region beyond the 1:3 mmr , the depletion of the planet population is not so strong than in the region between 2:1 and 1:3 mmr .",
    "this feature is in a good agreement with the weaker gravitational influence of the tres-3b planet .",
    "based on our results , we showed that the region inside the tres-3b planet orbit ( especially inside the 2:1 up to 3:1 mmr ) can be stable on longer timescales ( hundreds of years or hundred thousands of revolutions of tres-3b around the star ) from the dynamical point of view .",
    "the region from 0.015@xmath1au ( near 2:1 mmr ) to 0.05@xmath1au ( near 1:3 mmr ) was found unstable apart from moderately populated mmrs located in this area ( see figures fig.[fig_ae ] and fig.[fig_ai ] ) .",
    "the relatively small increase of population in the mentioned mmrs depends on the initial values of semi - major axis , eccentricity and inclination .",
    "the region beyond the 0.05@xmath1au was found to have a chaotic behavior and the depletion of the planet population increases with increasing values of initial eccentricity as well as inclination .",
    "based on the transit light curves obtained at several observatories between may 2009 and september 2011 we redetermined orbital parameters and the radius of the transiting planet tres-3b .",
    "the best light curve ( obtained at calar alto , sep 2010 ) was used for light curve analysis , and the data from the other observatories were used for @xmath0 determination and ttv investigation .",
    "we used two independent solutions for parameters determination and finally , we concluded that our values are consistent with previous results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of this present paper was also to discuss possible presence of a second planet in the extrasolar system tres-3 .",
    "for this purpose we used our new 14 mid - transit times and the individual determinations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath94 diagram showed no significant deviation of data points from the linear ephemeris .",
    "in addition , we tried to search for a periodicity that could be caused by an additional body in the system .",
    "we can conclude that a strictly periodic ttv signal with the amplitude greater than 1 minute over a 4-year time span seems to be unlikely .",
    "this result , together with refined assumptions of @xcite allow us to put upper constraints on the mass of a potential perturbing planet .",
    "the additional earth - mass planet close to inner 3:1 , 2:1 , and 5:3 and outer 3:5 , 1:2 , and 1:3 mmrs can be excluded .",
    "finally , we used the long - term integration of the theoretical set of massless particles generated in tres-3 system for studying the dynamical stability of potential second planet in the system ( influenced by tres-3b gravitation ) . from our analysis",
    "we found that the region inside the tres-3b planet orbit ( especially inside the 2:1 mmr ) up to 3:1 mmr can be stable on longer timescales ( hundreds of years or hundred thousands of revolutions of tres-3b around the star ) from the dynamical point of view .",
    "the region from 0.015@xmath1au ( near 2:1 mmr ) to 0.05@xmath1au ( near 1:3 mmr ) was found to be unstable apart from moderately populated mmrs located in this area .",
    "the relatively small increase of population in these mmrs depends on the initial values of semi - major axis , eccentricity and inclination .",
    "the region beyond 0.05@xmath1au was found to have a chaotic behavior and depletion of the planet population increases with increasing values of initial eccentricity as well as inclination .",
