    "superconductivity in the copper - oxygen compounds ( cuprates ) @xcite occurs at transition temperatures @xmath1 above 100  k with the origin still controversial . on a basic level",
    "the problem can be cast into the question as to whether the condensed state at low - temperature is an instability of the normal metal as in conventional systems or a new ground state . if superconductivity results from interactions between the electrons via an intermediary boson the theoretical approach proposed by eliashberg @xcite should provide an at least qualitative description of the condensation of electrons into cooper pairs .",
    "signatures of the coupling boson should also determine the properties above @xmath1 .",
    "traditionally , one looks at renormalization effects in the single - particle or transport responses as a function of temperature , specifically around @xmath1 where abrupt changes are to be expected @xcite . if the spectral shape of the coupling function can be retrieved @xcite one may be in a position to derive the relevant interaction(s ) .",
    "however , the results in the cuprates are far from converging into a unified picture .",
    "the unsuccessful search for clear signatures of a dominating retarded interaction was one reason why new ground states were and are being studied intensively @xcite .",
    "there were early proposals that the superconductivity in the cuprates could be a property of the electrons alone .",
    "a prominent example is the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state with antiferromagnetic coupling of nearest neighbor spins @xcite which emerges from the nel state upon doping @xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    "this proposal is much harder to pin down than superconductivity as an instability or a small perturbation of the normal state .",
    "there is indeed an arsenal of methods to analyze data in terms of an eliashberg - type strong coupling approach @xcite while ideas for experiments unveiling new ground states are scarce .",
    "our raman experiments aim at disentangling strong coupling effects evolving mainly as a function of temperature @xcite from phase transitions and cross - over phenomena occurring as a function of doping ( see also ref .",
    "we develop an analysis using a phenomenological description of the response @xcite . starting from single - particle properties observed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )",
    "we calculate the electronic raman response ( ers ) in both the normal and the superconducting states . while arpes measures occupied single - electron states ers yields - similarly as , e.g. , optical transport ( ir ) - a weighted convolution of occupied and empty states .",
    "therefore the two - particle spectra contain additional information originating from the interaction between the hole and the electron created in the scattering process .",
    "in the raman process an electron is scattered through an intermediate high - energy state into an unoccupied level ( for a more detailed discussion see refs .",
    "the energy transferred to the electron corresponds to the difference between the incoming and the outgoing photon , @xmath2 . as a result of the coulomb interaction only charge fluctuations inside the unit cell can be observed .",
    "the resulting selection rules lead to form factors @xmath3 weighing out symmetry - specific regions of the brillouin zone . for crossed photon polarizations aligned along the principle axes ( of the cuo@xmath4 plane ) the @xmath5 symmetry",

    "we follow the phenomenology of inosov _ et al .",
    "we have measured electronic raman spectra of bi-2212 and lsco above and below the `` critical '' doping @xmath72 at which the @xmath7 response changes qualitatively . in bi-2212",
    "we have evidence that the transition is quite abrupt @xcite .",
    "neither in @xmath73 ( tl-2201 ) nor in lsco the doping levels are sufficiently dense to allow this conclusion . however , the crossover in the range of 21% is clearly seen and seems to be one of the generic features of the raman response in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "we now try to answer the question in which way this feature can be related to other properties of the cuprates as observed for example in arpes or transport experiments .",
    "we start with non - superconducting lsco ( @xmath74 ) and parameterize the self - energy as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 to obtain the proper filling and satisfactory agreement with the arpes spectra @xcite . in addition , the temperature dependence of the resistivity is well reproduced . with these parameters ,",

    "( [ eq : chi ] ) we arrive at the raman spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsco - t ] .",
    "the agreement is remarkable since only a single intensity is set at 150  k. symmetry and temperature dependence follow then within the model .",
    "it has been shown before that the longitudinal and the hall resistivity can be reproduced in a boltzmann approach with similar assumptions @xcite . here , we use full * k * sums to calculate the spectra at finite energies .",
    "the limitation to the fermi surface would suppress essential structures of the spectra originating from the anisotropy of @xmath81 and the proximity of the van hove singularity to @xmath82 .",
    "the agreement reaches beyond the energy range shown here and leaves only little spectral weight unexplained up to 1  ev .",
    "the agreement between various single- and two - particle probes at high doping demonstrates that the self energy alone captures the essential many - body physics and that the lowest order approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) is sufficient for the calculation of response functions .",

    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) are based on fluctuations .",
    "they lead to `` marginal '' behavior with strongly reduced quasiparticle weight , @xmath84 , at the fermi surface , in certain doping and temperature ranges . the marginal fermi - liquid model ( mfl )",
    "@xcite was the first proposal which predicted expressions similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) . later , circulating orbital currents were proposed to be the microscopic origin of this phenomenology @xcite which may leave an imprint on the bragg peaks in neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of an incipient charge density wave ( cdw ) @xcite or a fermi surface deformation @xcite are also candidates .",
    "they lead to fermi liquid like variations of @xmath83 at low temperature , actually well below @xmath1 , and predict a strong momentum dependence of the self energy close to the quantum critical point where the transition temperature to the ordered or partially ordered state approaches or extrapolates to zero .",
    "in fact , indications of cdw fluctuations , nematic or even long - ranged ordering have been observed in various experiments @xcite .    at high doping ,",
    "@xmath85 , an anisotropy of the self energy is not observed . upon decreasing",
    "the doping level the arpes spectra show only little variation and even around optimal doping there are well defined quasiparticle peaks on the entire fermi surface .",
    "all changes appear to be continuous @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath7 raman spectra change abruptly close to @xmath86 @xcite . since there is no discontinuity in the arpes spectra around @xmath87 we can use the same model for @xmath83 and @xmath81 on either side of the crossover .",
    "the comparison between the prediction on the basis of the arpes results and the observed @xmath7 raman spectra for samples above and below @xmath87 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bi - lsco ] . in @xmath5 symmetry ,",
    "the spectra are well described at both doping levels and , beyond that , down to the lowest carrier concentration inside the superconducting dome @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 spectra , however , drop considerably below the simulation in the range below 1000  @xmath88 .",
    "while the spectral shapes are similar in bi-2212 and lsco the overall intensity in lsco is subject to variations of the cross section due to resonance effects .",
    "the main result here is twofold .",
    "( i ) a strong interaction sets in below approximately 21% doping which ( ii ) manifests itself predominantly in the two particle properties .",
    "indications of this interaction have been seen a long time ago by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite which measures a similar response function [ see eq .  ( [ eq : chi ] ) ] . with raman scattering",
    "we can additionally pin down the momentum dependence @xcite . in ir experiments anomalies",
    "are mainly observed in the @xmath89-axis conductivity of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 - 123 with @xmath92y , nd , la ) compounds @xcite while the transport in the @xmath93 plane is essentially captured by a fermi liquid or mfl phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this is not unexpected and compatible with the raman results when the bz projections of the respective methods are taken into account .",
    "then , due to the band structure of the cuprates @xcite in - plane ir and @xmath5 raman project predominantly the nodes while out - of - plane transport and @xmath7 raman are more sensitive at the anti - node @xcite",
    ".    it has been suggested that an increasing contribution from anisotropic elastic scattering of electrons leads to the dichotomy between nodal ( @xmath94 ) and anti - nodal ( @xmath95 ) particles @xcite .",
    "we check this proposal here by adding an energy and temperature independent anisotropic scattering rate varying as @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 properly selected the variation of the scattering rate on the fermi surface as used for tl-2201 @xcite ( but not any more for lsco @xcite ) is reproduced to within a few percent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : imp ] we compare the resulting raman spectra with the experimental data of lsco at optimal doping . for our choice of parameters",
    "the phenomenological curves fit the shape and the temperature dependence of the @xmath7 data reasonably well but deviate now significantly from those in @xmath5 symmetry . in lsco a fit to the @xmath7 results is still possible since the temperature dependence of the spectra remains metallic .",
    "in contrast , the spectra in bi-2212 exhibit even a slightly insulating variation with temperature around optimal doping @xcite and agreement between the calculated and the experimental @xmath7 spectra can not be obtained any further .",
    "we conclude that an elastic term is insufficient to reconcile single- and two - particle properties at optimal doping in the same approximation as at high doping and that dynamic interactions are at the origin of the observed effects .",
    "in addition , it is not completely surprising that higher order corrections may become necessary when entering the low doping range .",
    "the reason why the transport data can be reproduced reasonably well in terms of an isotropic boltzmann approximation @xcite is not immediately obvious .",
    "the linear dispersion , @xmath99 , around the fermi momentum @xmath100 and the specific variation of the current vertices used in that approach may be part of the explanation . in earlier studies of the superconducting response we actually found substantial differences between fermi surface and * k * integration .",
    "after all , the transport is mainly due to nodal quasiparticles which survive down to at least @xmath101 and may be mostly blind for the effects we find around @xmath0 .",
    "the most remarkable results here are the continuous versus abrupt changes in arpes and transport studies and , respectively , in the raman spectra across the critical doping level of @xmath102 .",
    "apparently , we encounter a transition from an essentially conventional metallic state to one of strongly interacting electrons .",
    "the origin of the dichotomy between single- vs two - particle properties has to remain open at the moment . from the raman scattering point of view",
    "a doping - dependent elastic term can be excluded as an explanation .    below @xmath1",
    "an additional complication arises . while the @xmath5 response [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ]  ( a ) ] is universal , the @xmath7 spectra clearly reflect sample specific behavior and the superconductivity - induced features exhibit a statistically significant sample dependence at a given doping level as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ]  ( b ) .",
    "more quantitatively , the @xmath5 response [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ]  ( a ) ] scales with the individual @xmath1 , and is satisfactorily described already by the weak - coupling prediction .",
    "there are only small differences in the intensity close to the peak maximum which can be traced back to variations in the impurity concentration @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath7 spectra [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ]  ( b ) ] clearly reflect sample specific behavior and , beyond that , do not scale with @xmath1 but rather as @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "moreover , on the basis of results obtained with applied pressure @xcite we conclude that internal strain induced by quenched disorder @xcite leads to the variation of the @xmath7 spectra below @xmath1 .",
    "this experimental fact escaped attention so far but may shed light on the origin of the @xmath7 spectra .",
    "it is indeed hard to understand their origin in terms of a pure pair - breaking effect .",
    "this qualitative reasoning is fully corroborated by the simulations derived from the arpes spectra . here , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) must be formulated for superconductivity , and the diagonal ( normal ) and the off - diagonal ( anomalous ) parts of the green function @xcite are needed .",
    "the self energies have to be derived in the spirit of a strong coupling approach @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the @xmath5 spectra is comparable to that of the weak - coupling prediction ( fig .",

    "the @xmath7 raman spectra in both the normal state and the superconductivity - induced features are progressively suppressed in a frequency range of at least 1500@xmath88 . as opposed to transport measurements @xcite , a momentum dependent constant relaxation term alone which",

    "we rather conclude , that the origin of the discrepancies is due to dynamic processes .",
    "the abrupt onset of renormalization effects in the @xmath7 spectra suggests a crossover controlled by a quantum critical point close to the center of the superconducting dome @xcite .",
    "a new type of interaction appears which is not fully described by the single - particle self energy .",
    "it is an interesting question as to whether or not the suppression of spectral weight has its origin in the the same interactions as those which favor a new ground state and induce superconductivity .",
    "similarly as in the normal state , the @xmath5 responses below @xmath1 look rather conventional and scale with the individual transition temperatures in the entire doping range studied @xcite .",
