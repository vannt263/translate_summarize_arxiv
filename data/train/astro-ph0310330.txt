    "the warm ionized medium ( wim ) is now recognized as a significant component of the interstellar medium .",
    "several studies over the past few decades have revealed the presence of diffuse ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) , warm ( @xmath4 ) ionized gas spread throughout the galaxy .",
    "historically , this phase of the ism was thought to be confined primarily to classical h@xmath1iiregions and planetary nebulae .",
    "however , the spectral characteristics of the galactic synchotron emission ( hoyle & ellis 1963 ) , the discovery of pulsars and their dispersion measures ( guelin 1974 ) , and the detection of faint optical emission lines ( reynolds et al 1974 ) all lead to the notion that a widespread , diffuse layer of h@xmath1ii  permeates the galaxy . this gas is now known to occupy a significant fraction of the galaxy ( a volume filling fraction @xmath5 20% ) and account for most ( 90% ) of the photoionized gas in the solar neighborhood ( d @xmath6  kpc ) ( reynolds 1991 ; taylor & cordes 1993 ; mitra , this conference ) . with a scale height of @xmath51 kpc ( haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1999 ) , and a column density perpendicular to the plane of @xmath7 ( reynolds 1989 ) , this material plays a crucial role in our understanding of the physical conditions and dynamics of the ism in general .",
    "the presence of diffuse ionized gas in external galaxies is also now firmly established ( dettmar , this conference ) .    despite the fact that it is a significant component of the interstellar medium , the origin and physical conditions within the wim remain poorly understood .",
    "questions such as how the wim is ionized , what is its source of heating , and how its structures are formed have yet to be fully answered .",
    "the lyman continuum radiation from ob stars is the only known source with sufficient power to ionize the wim ( see beckman , this conference ) ; however , it is not understood how this radiation , originating from widely separated , discrete regions near the midplane , is able to penetrate the ubiquitous neutral hydrogen to produce this widely spread h@xmath8 within the disk and halo . the energy from a variety of sources such as supernovae , hot white dwarf stars , turbulent mixing layers , and magnetic reconnection may also contribute , but they appear incapable of producing most of the ionization ( reynolds 1990 ; slavin , this conference ) .    even though the primary source of ionization is believed to be o stars , the temperature and ionization conditions within the diffuse ionized gas appear to differ significantly from conditions within classical o star h@xmath1ii  regions .",
    "for example , anomalously strong [ s@xmath1ii]@xmath9/h@xmath0  and [ n@xmath1ii]@xmath10/h@xmath0 , and weak [ o@xmath1iii]@xmath11/h@xmath0  emission line ratios ( compared to the bright , classical h@xmath1ii  regions ) indicate a low state of excitation with few ions present that require ionization energies greater than 23 ev ( haffner et al 1999 ; rand 1997 ; wood , this conference ) .",
    "this is consistent with the low ionization fraction of helium , at least for the helium near the midplane , implying that the spectrum of the diffuse interstellar radiation field that ionizes the hydrogen is significantly softer than that from the average galactic o star population ( reynolds & tufte 1995 , heiles et al 1996 ) .",
    "photoionization models also fail to account fully for observations of line ratios among some of the other emission lines .",
    "for example , the models do not explain the very large increases in [ s@xmath1ii]/h@xmath0  and [ n@xmath1ii]/h@xmath0   ( accompanied by an increase in [ o@xmath1iii ] ) with distance from the midplane or the observed constancy of [ s@xmath1ii]/[n@xmath1ii ] ( see reynolds et al 1999 , haffner et al 1999 , collins & rand 2001 ) .",
    "there is also growing evidence that the wim requires an additional heating source other than photoionization , as revealed by observations of [ s@xmath1ii ] , [ n@xmath1ii ] , and [ nii]@xmath125755  ( reynolds et al 2001 , reynolds , haffner , & tufte 1999 ) .",
    "photoelectric heating by grains , dissipation of turbulence , damping of mhd waves , and cosmic ray interactions have all been proposed as supplemental heating sources .",
    "the warm ionized medium clearly has an important bearing on our understanding of the composition and structure of the interstellar medium and the processes of ionization and heating in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "the wisconsin h@xmath0  mapper has mapped the entire northern sky ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) in the brightest optical emission line of the wim , balmer h@xmath0  ( haffner et al 2003 ) . with its dual - etalon fabry - perot design , one degree diameter field of view , 12 kms@xmath15  spectral resolution within a 200 kms@xmath15  spectral window , and unprecedented sensitivity of 0.1 rayleigh",
    ", wham has produced maps of the h@xmath1ii  comparable to the 21 cm surveys of the h@xmath1i .",
    "these maps reveal for the first time the detailed structure of the wim , including long filaments , loops , `` worms '' , and `` point sources '' superposed on a diffuse background ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "whereas other h@xmath0  surveys ( eg . gaustad et al 2001 , parker & phillipps 1998 , dennison et al 1998 ) are limited in sensitivity , spatial coverage , or velocity resolution , the wham northern sky survey ( wham - nss ) , although having lower angular resolution , has provided a complete view of both the distribution and kinematics of the wim over the entire northern sky .",
    "wham is now poised to play an equally significant role characterizing the physical conditions within the gas , exploring the relationship of this warm ionized phase to the other principal phases of the medium , and investigating sources of ionization and heating within the galactic disk and halo .",
    "the spectacular structure revealed by the new detailed view of the wim from the wham - nss naturally leads to a number of interesting questions .",
    "for example , how do hii regions differ from structures in the wim and the diffuse wim ? how can the variations in the line ratios be explained ?",
    "why is the h@xmath1ii  so widespread in the disk and halo ? is the diffuse wim a superposition of filaments , loops , etc ? to help answer these questions ,",
    "we have begun examining several interesting h@xmath0  features through observations in other optical emission lines .",
    "the maps in figures 2 and 3 show regions of the wim that sample classical h@xmath1ii  regions and shells , large - scale filaments with no associated ionizing sources , and the more truly diffuse wim . by analyzing the relative strengths , line ratios , and line widths of h@xmath0 , he@xmath1i , [ n@xmath1ii ] , [ s@xmath1ii ] , and [ o@xmath1iii ] of these features , the temperature and ionization conditions of the gas can be inferred ( haffner et al 1999 , reynolds et al 1999 ) . for example , diagnostic plots of",
    "[ n@xmath1ii]/h@xmath0  vs. [ s@xmath1ii]/h@xmath0 , can be used to compare the derived electron temperature of the gas and ionization state of sulfur among the different wim environments ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "populating plots like these with observations toward a large number of directions may help to classify these structures and understand their origin .",
    "observations of lines from other ions such as [ o@xmath1iii ] will further constrain the ionization conditions and lead to some insight as to how these features might be related to one another ( madsen et al 2003 , in prep ) .",
    "emission structures from the wham - nss with a diagnostic line ratio plot .",
    "the maps show the variety of the h@xmath0  emitting features in the wim , with only some having known sources of ionization .",
    "observations of the relative line strengths of [ s@xmath1ii ] , [ n@xmath1ii ] , and h@xmath0  toward structures like these can be used to constrain their physical conditions . using [ n@xmath1ii]/h@xmath0  as a measure of temperature , and [ n@xmath1ii]/[s@xmath1ii ] as a measure of s@xmath8/s",
    ", the plot on the right can be used to classify these features and may lead to an understanding of their origin . ]",
    "one of the more surprising results from the wham - nss is the visibility of significant amounts of h@xmath0  emission at velocities exceeding + 100  kms@xmath15  ( lsr ) toward the inner galaxy ( @xmath16 ) , implying the detection of ionized gas at large distances from the sun .",
    "the velocity coverage of these observations have been extended out to + 150 kms@xmath15 , beyond the tangent point velocities ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these new observations have confirmed the survey s detection of faint emission at high velocities from this very distant gas ( madsen et al 2003 , in prep ) . in a 5@xmath14  by 5@xmath14  area",
    ", we detect diffuse optical emission a few degrees off the galactic plane at velocities that place the gas near the tangent point at kinematic distances of 7 - 8 kpc , assuming the gas participates in galactic rotation .",
    "h@xmath17  observations of this same region show a monotonic increase of the h@xmath0/h@xmath17  ratio with increasing velocity ( or distance ) .",
    "this suggests that 1 ) interstellar dust is affecting this emission , and 2 ) that the emission at higher velocities is traversing a longer path containing dust , confirming that the higher velocity emission originates at larger heliocentric distances and is probing the inner parts of the galaxy . with a higher star - formation rate , larger gravitational pressure , and stronger uv flux ,",
    "the temperature and ionization conditions of diffuse ionized gas in the inner galaxy are likely to vary significantly from what is found nearby .",
    "however , studies of the wim close to the midplane where the ionizing stars are located , were thought to be prohibitive due to optical extinction .",
    "this optical window provides a unique opportunity to explore , for the first time , the properties of diffuse ionized gas in the central regions of the galaxy using the same optical emission line diagnostic techniques to examine the wim in the solar neighborhood .    map and spectra from the wham - nss toward the inner galaxy .",
    "the large dark feature in the middle of the map is the aquila rift , a nearby dust cloud ( @xmath18 pc ) that is obscuring the h@xmath0  emission behind it with @xmath19 > 25 kms@xmath15 .",
    "the three diagrams below the map show the h@xmath0  spectra toward the indicated directions , revealing the change in the obscuration of emission from the local neighborhood ( 0 kms@xmath15 ) , the sagittarius arm ( + 50  kms@xmath15 ) , and the scutum arm ( + 80 kms@xmath15 ) .",
    "the black box is the low extinction window with emission out to the tangent point velocity .",
    "the plot on the right shows an h@xmath0 , h@xmath17 , h@xmath1i , and co spectrum toward this window out to the tangent point velocity , denoted by a vertical dashed line .",
    "the inferred attenuation ( @xmath20 ) as a function of velocity ( distance ) , derived from h@xmath0/h@xmath17 , is shown at the bottom . ]",
    "and h@xmath1i  maps with multi - wavelength spectra .",
    "the upper h@xmath0  maps are from the wham - nss with the lower h@xmath1i  maps from the lds , and they span two different velocity intervals sampling the local ism and the perseus spiral arm . note the lack of correspondence between h@xmath0  and h@xmath1i  features from nearby gas on the maps on the left , whereas a correspondence between some filaments and clouds begin to emerge from the distant gas in the maps on the right .",
    "the spectra on the far right are of different emission lines toward the direction indicated by the plus sign .",
    "four distinct velocity components in the ionized gas are identified , with significant variations in the line ratios from one component to another . ]",
    "the relationship between neutral atomic hydrogen and warm ionized hydrogen , the two principal states of interstellar gas above the galactic plane ( @xmath21  5@xmath14 ) , is not well known , and there are a number of possibilities .",
    "the h@xmath1ii  may be confined to the outer envelopes of h@xmath1i  clouds embedded in a low - density , hot ionized medium ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1ii  may be the fully ionized component of a widespread warm neutral medium ( miller & cox 1993 )",
    ". the h@xmath1ii  may be well mixed with h@xmath1i  in partially ionized clouds ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ) .",
    "several detailed studies of relatively high - density regions of the ism near the galactic midplane ( e.g. individual h@xmath1ii  regions and supernova remnants ) have established relationships between these phases on a small scale .",
    "however , the relationship , if any , between h@xmath1ii  and h@xmath1i  in the large - scale diffuse ism has yet to be established observationally . with an h@xmath0  spectral map of the whole northern sky now complete , as well as comparable all - sky h@xmath1i  surveys such as the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds , hartmann & burton 1997 ) and the h@xmath1i  parkes all sky survey ( barnes et al 2001 )",
    ", it is now possible to address this question to determine how h@xmath1ii  and h@xmath1i  are related as a whole in the diffuse ism .",
    "preliminary studies of this relationship highlight the complexities of such an effort . when integrated over all velocities , the total intensity maps of h@xmath0  from the wham - nss , and h@xmath1i  from the lds , bear little or no morphological resemblance to one another ( see fig .",
    "however , the total intensity maps are dominated by emission from cold h@xmath1i  ( narrow line - width ) clouds at velocities near the local standard of rest .",
    "these cold clouds may be residing inside warm h@xmath1i  envelopes , and hence have little associated ionized hydrogen . by moving out to intermediate velocities , isolating emission from warm gas above spiral arms ,",
    "a morphological correspondence begins to emerge , suggesting that at least some of the h@xmath1ii  is somehow related to the h@xmath1i  clouds away from the galactic plane . examining the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1i  spectra and the morphology toward a large region of the perseus arm ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that there is 1 ) a good spatial correlation between individual h@xmath1ii  and h@xmath1i  filaments and 2 ) a good correlation of h@xmath1ii  with _ warm _",
    "h@xmath1i  emission components .",
    "there is little or no correlation between the h@xmath0  emission and the cold h@xmath1i  emission components , as expected .",
    "in addition , there is little or no correlation between the _ strength _ of the h@xmath1ii  and warm h@xmath1i  emission , as expected since the hydrogen in the wim is likely photoionized .",
    "these observations do not establish if the h@xmath1ii  and warm h@xmath1i  are well mixed , or separated by an h@xmath1i ",
    "h@xmath1ii  cloud boundary .",
    "an ideal program would be to identify a population of well - defined , intermediate - velocity , isolated warm h@xmath1i  clouds and look for limb - brightened associated h@xmath0  emission on the edge of the h@xmath1i  clouds .",
    "however , the relatively low densities ( @xmath22 @xmath3 ) and incident ionizing flux ( @xmath23photons  @xmath24  s@xmath15 ) of these clouds dilute this limb brightening effect , resulting in relatively large ionized layers ( @xmath25pc ) with low contrast ( madsen et al 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , constraints on the ionization fraction of hydrogen of the clouds can be made through observations of [ o@xmath1i ]  @xmath266300/h@xmath0   ( reynolds et al 2001 ) .",
    "a future observational program searching for changes in the ionization fraction across the faces of h@xmath1i  clouds through [ o@xmath1i ]  spectra will help to assess the relationship between h@xmath1i  and h@xmath1ii .",
    "wham continues to explore diffuse ionized gas through the generous support of the national science foundation , through grant ast 02 - 04973 .",
