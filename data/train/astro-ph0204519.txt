    "measurements of the depletion of heavy elements , relative to the solar abundances , along the line of sight to the stars show that about @xmath4 of the metals in the galaxy is bound up in dust grains ( whittet 1992 ) .",
    "this raises the questions : is this fraction the same for every galaxy ?",
    "what are the processes that so efficiently lock metals into dust grains ?",
    "although the presence of dust manifests itself in a multitude of ways - extinction , reddening , the polarisation of starlight , to name but three - the best way , in principle , to estimate the mass of dust in a galaxy is from the submm flux density .",
    "the advantages of this are that ( a ) the emission from dust is optically thin and ( b ) the emission depends mainly on the mass of dust and is only weakly dependent on the temperature of the dust . the practical obstacle to making the full use of this technique has been the difficulty of estimating the constant of proportionality between the emission and the mass of dust , the mass - extinction or the mass - absorption coefficient .",
    "there are two methods that have been used to estimate this constant .",
    "the most commonly used technique to calibrate this constant is by observations of galactic reflection nebulae ( hildebrand 1983 ; casey et al .",
    "1991 ) . by making optical and far - infrared / submillimetre observations",
    ", one can estimate @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath7 in a reasonably straightforward way . if one assumes a value of _",
    "@xmath8 _ and a gas - to - dust ratio , one can estimate the mass - absorption coefficient , @xmath0 . for observations at long wavelengths such as with the scuba submillimetre camera ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) , which operates mostly at 850@xmath9 m , there is also the practical problem that this technique has only been applied at relatively short ( @xmath10 @xmath11 400@xmath9 m ) submillimetre wavelengths , which means that the coefficient has to be extrapolated to longer wavelengths . since the dust emissivity index , @xmath12",
    ", @xmath13 is uncertain by a factor of two , there is an immediate uncertainty of a factor of two in the long - wavelength value of @xmath0 on top of all the other uncertainties .",
    "this problem , of course , could be solved by scuba observations of reflection nebulae , but there are additional problems with this technique .",
    "first , there is evidence that the properties of dust vary with environment ( e.g. cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) , and so the dust in a reflection nebula may not be representative of a galaxy as a whole .",
    "second , the technique relies on the assumption of spherical symmetry for the reflection nebulae and on the values for properties that are not themselves simple to measure , such as the dust - to - gas ratio and _ @xmath8 _ ( although there are variations in this technique that do not require these , there are other assumptions that have to be made , such as the typical sizes and densities of dust grains ) .",
    "hughes et al .",
    "( 1993 ) estimate that the factor of uncertainty in @xmath14 at @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "alton ( 2000 ) employed hildebrand s ( 1983 ) technique using scuba observations of an external galaxy to derive @xmath17 , essentially using a galaxy rather than a reflection nebula to calibrate @xmath0 .",
    "this method obviously avoids the problems of extrapolation to longer wavelengths and the fact that nebular dust may not be the same as dust in the rest of the interstellar medium but still requires assumptions to be made about the physical properties of the dust .",
    "the other technique that has been used to estimate @xmath0 is more loosely linked to submillimetre observations . in this technique one",
    "constructs a model for dust ( its chemical composition , distribution of grain sizes etc . ) that agrees with all the available data , for example the shape of the optical extinction curve , and then uses the model to estimate the value of the submillimetre mass - absorption coefficient ( draine & lee 1984 ; hughes et al . 1993 ) .    in this paper",
    "we suggest an alternative way of estimating the mass - absorption coefficient based on the global properties of galaxies rather than on individual properties within the galaxy .",
    "this technique is based on the assumption that the fraction of metals within the interstellar medium of a galaxy that is bound up in dust is a constant .",
    "there is some evidence for this from the correlation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity in nearby galaxies ( issa , maclaren & wolfendale 1990 ) .",
    "the high depletion of many elements within our own ism ( whittet 1992 ) also suggests that the mechanism forming dust is efficient - that is , if there are metals present , they are efficiently incorporated into dust grains .",
    "finally , there is evidence in the galaxy that although the dust extinction curve is quite variable from place to place , the gas phase carbon and oxygen abundances are remarkably constant over a wide range of ism density ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ; meyer et al .",
    "1998 ) , implying ( as these elements are the most important constituents of dust ) that the fraction of metals in dust is a constant .",
    "in contrast to this evidence , lisenfeld & ferrara ( 1998 ) found a non - linear relationship between metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio for 28 dwarf irregular galaxies , which suggests that @xmath2 , the fraction of metals locked up in dust , is not the same for all types of galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we will present new data that shows that lisenfeld & ferrara s technique missed cool dust , and when this is taken into account @xmath2 does appear to be remarkably constant from galaxy to galaxy .    to apply the technique",
    "we need a galaxy which has submillimetre and far - infrared flux measurements , a measure of its total gass mass , and a measure of its metallicity .",
    "the dust mass of the galaxy is then given by two equations :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the mass of gas in the galaxy , @xmath20 is the metallicity relative to solar , @xmath2 is the ratio of the mass of metals in the dust to the total mass of metals and @xmath21 is the ratio of the mass of metals to the mass of gas for gas with solar metallicity , we estimate @xmath22 , and ; @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is the flux density at 850@xmath9 m , @xmath25 is the distance of the galaxy , @xmath26 is the value of the planck function at 850@xmath9 m , t is the dust temperature and @xmath27 is the mass - absorption coefficient at 850@xmath9 m .",
    "we then set these two equations equal to one another , and as long as we know @xmath2 , we can estimate @xmath0 .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the results of a search through the archive of the james clerk maxwell telescope for submm data for galaxies with known metal abundances . in section 3",
    "we derive a value for @xmath2 based on observations of the local interstellar medium .",
    "in section 4 we apply the technique to estimate @xmath0 and investigate whether @xmath2 is a universal constant .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath28 .",
    "we looked through the jcmt archive for all the objects for which there are both abundance measurements and observations with the scuba camera ( holland 1999 ) .",
    "table 1 is a list of galaxies in the archive for which there are published metallicity measurements but no published submm results .",
    "the data for these five objects was reduced in the usual way using the surf ( jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) software package .",
    "images were first flat - fielded to remove inhomogeneity in bolometer sensitivity .",
    "corrections were then made for atmospheric absorption using the opacities ( @xmath29 ) derived from skydip measurements .",
    "noisy bolometers were masked and large spikes in the bolometer time - stream removed by applying a 4-@xmath30 clip .",
    "residual sky noise was removed with the surf task remsky . following removal of the sky noise ,",
    "the bolometer time - stream was clipped again at the 3-@xmath30 level .",
    "all the datasets in the archive which were taken with the same chop throw were then made into a map using the surf program rebin .",
    "the maps were calibrated using jiggle maps of both primary and secondary calibrators reduced in the same way .",
    "figure 1 shows contour plots of the maps of these objects overlaid on images from the digitised sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "the lowest level contour is @xmath31 and increasing in @xmath31 steps to @xmath32 .",
    "although it appears that the submm emission is concentrated in the centre of ngc5253 , the dynamical range of the optical data is much greater than the submm data , thereby making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions as to whether the optical emission is indeed more extended than the dust emission .",
    "the flux was measured by using the dss image as a guide to chose an aperture which contained as much of the galaxy and as little of the sky as possible .",
    "the flux errors were estimated using the procedure in dunne et al .",
    "the fluxes and the apertures used are given in table 1 .",
    "since the first draft of this paper another submm map of ngc1569 has been published ( lisenfeld et al .",
    "the new data was taken in much better conditions than the data we retrieved from the scuba archive and the flux measured is significantly higher than ours .",
    "we repeated our reduction of this object but the flux determined remained @xmath33 lower than the flux measured by lisenfeld et al .",
    "the discrepancy may arise from the galaxy being larger than the scuba array , for which lisenfeld et al ( 2001 ) have tried to correct .",

    "the fraction of metals incorporated in dust in the interstellar medium can be estimated from @xmath37 spectroscopic observations of nearby stars , which show that a significant fraction of the metals that one would expect , from cosmic abundances , to be in the ism are not there - they have been bound up in dust . if @xmath38 is the number of atoms of a given chemical element relative to the number of hydrogen atoms , @xmath39 is the atomic weight of the element , and @xmath40 is the proportion of that element bound up in dust , then @xmath41 recent @xmath37 observations of nearby stars with the hubble space telescope have made it possible to calculate @xmath2 more accurately because they have provided accurate depletion measurements for two of the most important elements , oxygen and carbon , strong evidence that the depletion is the same along different sight lines , and evidence that the cosmic metal abundance is about two thirds the solar metal abundance ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ; meyer et al .",
    "1998 ) . to calculate @xmath2",
    ", we have assumed the solar metal abundance given in pagel ( 1997 ) and then multiplied this by two thirds to obtain the cosmic metal abundances .",
    "it should be noted that the recent re - determination of the solar oxygen abundance by allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , suggests that the solar metallicity is considerably closer to the ism value than has been conventionally assumed .",
    "we have assumed the depletions given by whittet ( 1992 ) , except that we have preferred the recent measurements for carbon and oxygen obtained from the hubble space telescope observations ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ; meyer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we obtain a value for @xmath2 of 0.456 .",
    "table 2 lists the submm results for all the galaxies that we are aware of which have metallicity measurements and submillimetre measurements .",
    "many of the objects in the table are taken from the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) of dunne et al .",
    "distances for objects with radial velocities @xmath42 were taken from the nearby galaxies catalogue ( tully 1988 ) .",
    "table 3 gives the metallicity measurements for the sample and also measurements of the masses of the atomic and molecular gas .",
    "metallicities for some slugs objects were estimated using strong line ratios and the calibration method of edmunds & pagel ( 1984 ) , relating @xmath43 and @xmath44/h_{\\alpha}$ ] and oxygen abundances in hii regions .",
    "line ratios were taken fron keel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and veilleux et al .",
    "although more recent work has shown that the edmunds & pagel calibrator may over - estimate metallicities above solar , it is probably a reasonable estimator in the abundance range of these galaxies .",
    "there are two complications to applying the simple method we have outlined in the introduction : ( a ) the requirement of equation ( 2 ) for a temperature model ; ( b ) the fact that estimates of gas mass depend to some extent on assumptions about metallicity .",
    "we will now discuss these in turn .",
    "dunne @xmath45 eales ( 2001 ) , in their investigation of the fir / submm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies in the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) , found that the 450/850@xmath9 m flux ratio is remarkably constant for galaxies with a wide range of luminosities .",
    "they conclude that the dust emissivity index @xmath12 must be @xmath462 .",
    "they then showed that with this emissivity index , there must be at least two dust components with different temperatures in galaxies , even in ultraluminous iras galaxies like arp220 .",
    "we fitted the dunne & eales two - component model to the five objects for which we have new scuba data .",
    "since we only have three fluxes for each galaxy ( 60 , 100 and @xmath1 m ) , we fixed the temperature of the cold component to be 20k , the average of the values found by dunne & eales ( 2001 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the fits for the five galaxies and table 2 gives the temperature of the warm component and the ratio of the cold - to - hot dust ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we have also given the results of the two component fits for the slugs galaxies by dunne & eales ( 2001 ) and values for a few other galaxies for which we either made two - component fits or for which we took two - component fits from the literature .",
    "from the results of these fits we have estimated dust masses using equation ( 4 ) : @xmath48\\ ] ] in which @xmath24 is the flux density at 850@xmath9 m , @xmath26 is the value of the planck function at 850@xmath9 m , @xmath27 is the mass - absorption coefficient at 850@xmath9 m and d is the distance found for @xmath49 .",
    "we have initially adopted the value for @xmath50 m ) of @xmath51 used by dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , although of course one of the goals of the present paper is to measure a new value for this .",
    "these initial estimates of the dust masses are given in table 2 .",
    "the mass of hi can be unambiguosly calculated from the intensity of the 21-cm line .",
    "following lisenfeld & ferrara ( 1998 ) , we have calculated the dust mass within the optical disk , since the metallicity ( and thus the dust content ) outside the optical disk is likely to be low .",
    "cold @xmath52 is detected indirectly by means of a tracer such as co. the @xmath53 conversion factor is however highly variable depending on temperature , density and metallicity .",
    "it is usual to determine the @xmath52 mass in a galaxy by applying a standard conversion factor , @xmath54 , where i(co ) is the velocity - integrated co intensity and @xmath55 is the molecular hydrogen column density .",
    "a complication here is that the conversion factor almost certainly depends on metallicity .",
    "we investigated the dependence of our method on this uncertainty by trying a number of suggested relationships between x and metallicity .",
    "molecular hydrogen ( @xmath52 ) masses for the five objects from the scuba archive were calculated from the co fluxes taken from the literature using @xmath56 ( see tinney et al .",

    "these are listed in table 3 . as an additional test of the sensitivity of the method to the x - factor",
    "we have also used a `` standard '' conversion factor , @xmath67 $ ] , from bloemen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) derived from observations of the galaxy .",
    "table 3 also gives the dust masses calculated using equation 1 .",
    "in figure 3 we have plotted the dust masses calculated by the two different methods against each other .",
    "we first performed a simple least - squares fit on the data points .",
    "all of the least squares solutions were consistent with a slope of unity .",
    "this suggests that the properties of dust , in particular @xmath0 and @xmath2 , are similar for dwarf galaxies and large galaxies like our own . on the assumption that this is true",
    ", the value of @xmath0 can be determined in the following way . if the value of @xmath0 we have initially assumed for plotting fig .",
    "3 is correct , the points should lie on a line of slope unity passing through the origin . by measuring the actual offset of the points from the line",

    "the method clearly does not depend critically on the metallicity - dependence of the co - to-@xmath52 x - factor , presumably because either the overall contribution of @xmath52 to the gas - mass is in all cases relatively small , or , where the molecular content is high , the x - factors do not vary greatly at these metallicities .",
    "the main uncertainty in the method is the basic assumption that the fraction of metals in dust ( @xmath2 ) is a universal constant .",
    "if this is not correct , our estimate of this constant , from observations of the interstellar medium in our own galaxy will not be applicable to other galaxies . however , figure 3 is itself evidence that this is not too bad an assumption .",
    "the scatter around the best fit lines is only a factor of 2 in the ordinate .",
    "this scatter includes all observational errors , as well as galaxy - to - galaxy variations in @xmath0 and @xmath2 . on the extreme assumption that all the scatter is caused by variation in @xmath2",
    ", we estimate that the galaxy - to - galaxy variation in @xmath2 can only be a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "if this extreme assumption is correct , then our estimate of @xmath71 , would have an error of a factor of @xmath72 for an individual galaxy .",
    "our conclusion that the fraction of metals incorporated in dust is the same for giant and dwarf galaxies is in contradiction with the conclusions of lisenfeld & ferrara ( 1998 ) , who found that metals are less effectively incorporated in dust in dwarfs than in giant galaxies .",
    "figure 4 shows metallicity plotted against dust - to - gas mass ratio for our sample and that of lisenfeld & ferrara .",
    "the lisenfeld & ferrara points suggest a non - linear relationship between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity .",
    "however we have re - observed some of the objects from their sample with scuba and find that their dust - to - gas mass ratios are increased when estimated from submm rather than far - infrared flux .",
    "this is expected since in their study , lisenfeld et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the _ iras _",
    "@xmath73 m flux ratio to determine a dust temperature and hence may have underestimated the dust mass by missing cold dust at longer wavelengths .",
    "the re - observed points are consistent with a slope of unity .",
    "very recently lisenfeld et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have suggested that a low dust mass is appropriate for ngc1569 , whether such a model is applicable to all dwarf galaxies , or is unique to ngc1569 is not yet clear . we have also plotted two of the galaxy dust evolution models of edmunds ( 2001 ) in figure 4 .",
    "the solid line shows a model in which supernovae play an important role in dust production and the dashed line a model in which dust is produced in some kinds of evolved low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "our current dataset is unable to make a distinction between these two models but further submm observations at low metallicities @xmath74 should help demonstrate whether or not condensation of dust grain cores in supernova ejecta is an important dust source .",
    "such observations will be quite challenging as the number of objects suitable for observation at @xmath1 m which have very low metallicities is small .    in figure 5",

    "<S> using a new technique we have determined a value for the constant of proportionality between submillimetre ( submm ) emission and dust mass , the dust mass absorption coefficient ( @xmath0 ) at @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> our method has an advantage over previous methods in that we avoid assumptions about the properties of dust in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> our only assumption is that the fraction of metals incorporated in the dust ( @xmath2 ) in galaxies is a universal constant . to implement our method we require objects that have submillimetre and far - infrared ( fir ) flux measurements as well as gas mass and metallicity estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we present data for all the galaxies with suitable measurements , including new submm maps for five galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also been able to use our sample to investigate our assumption that @xmath2 is a universal constant . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence that @xmath2 is different for dwarf and giant galaxies and show that the scatter in @xmath2 from galaxy to galaxy is apparently quite small .    </S>",
