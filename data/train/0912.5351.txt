    "numerical simulations of seidel and suen@xcite have revealed that spatially localized , extremely long living , oscillating configurations evolve from quite general initial data in the spherically symmetric sector of einstein s gravity coupled to a a free , massive real klein - gordon field .",
    "for example , they observed that initially gaussian pulses evolve quickly into configurations which appear to be time - periodic .",
    "it has been already noted in ref.@xcite , that the resulting objects may not be strictly time - periodic , rather they may evolve on a secular time scale many orders of magnitude longer than the observed oscillation period .",
    "these interesting objects were first baptized `` oscillating soliton stars '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , but somewhat later the same objects have been referred to as `` _ oscillatons _ '' by the same authors @xcite .",
    "this latter name has been by now widely adopted , and we shall also stick to its usage throughout this paper .",
    "it has been observed in the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite that oscillatons are _ stable _ during the time evolution",
    ". moreover it has been argued in ref.@xcite that oscillatons do form in physical processes through a dissipationless gravitational cooling mechanism , making them of great physical importance .",
    "for example oscillatons would be good candidates for dark matter in our universe .",
    "on the other hand , stimulated by the seminal work of dashen , hasslacher and neveu in the one - dimensional @xmath1-theory @xcite , numerical simulations have revealed that in an impressive number of scalar field theories spatially localized structures _oscillons_ form _ from generic initial data _ which become very closely time periodic , and live for very long times @xcite .",
    "these objects oscillate nearly periodically in time , resembling `` true '' ( i.e.  time - periodic ) breathers .",
    "an oscillon possesses a `` radiative '' tail outside of its core region where its energy is leaking continuously in form of ( scalar ) radiation .",
    "therefore a simple approximate physical picture of a sufficiently small - amplitude oscillon is the that of a `` true '' breather whose frequency is increasing on a secular time scale since the amplitude of the outgoing radiation is much smaller than that of the core .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , that slowly radiating oscillons can be well described by a special class of exactly time - periodic `` quasibreathers '' ( qb ) .",
    "being time periodic , qbs are easier to describe mathematically by ordinary fourier analysis than the long time asymptotics of oscillons .",
    "a qb possesses a localized core in space ( just like true breathers ) which approximates that of the corresponding oscillon very well , but in addition it has a standing wave tail whose amplitude is _",
    "minimized_. this is a physically motivated condition , which heuristically singles out `` the '' solution approximating a true breather as well as possible , for which this amplitude would be identically zero . the amplitude of the standing wave tail of a qb is closely related to that of the oscillon radiation , therefore its computation is of prime interest .",
    "roughly speaking `` half '' of the standing wave tail corresponds to incoming radiation from spatial infinity .",
    "it is the incoming radiation that maintains the time periodicity of the qbs by compensating the energy loss through the outgoing waves . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite a method has been developed to compute the leading part of the exponentially suppressed tail amplitude of qbs , in a large class of scalar theories in various dimensions , in the limit when the qb core amplitude is small .",
    "although oscillons continuously loose energy through radiation , many of them are remarkably stable .",
    "the longevity and the ubiquity of oscillons make them of potentially great physical interest @xcite .",
    "quite importantly oscillons also appear in the course of time evolution when other fields , e.g. vector fields are present @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that oscillons and oscillatons are closely related objects .",
    "the basic physical mechanism for the anti - intuitively slow radiation of oscillons is that the lowest frequency mode of the scalar field is trapped below the mass threshold and only the higher frequency modes are coupled to the continuum .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the method of refs.@xcite to compute the mass loss of spherically symmetric oscillations induced by scalar radiation in the limit of small oscillaton amplitudes , @xmath2 , in @xmath0 dimensional spacetimes .",
    "these methods have been succesfully applied to @xmath3-dimensional scalar field theories coupled to a dilaton field @xcite .",
    "numerous similarities exist between coupling a theory to a dilaton field and to gravitation : the field configurations are of @xmath4 order and the lowest order equations determining the profiles are the schrdinger - newton equations .",
    "the stability pattern is also analogous . despite these similarities between the dilaton and the gravitational theory",
    "there are some technical and even some conceptual differences .",
    "since there is no timelike killing vector neither for oscillatons nor for the corresponding qbs , already the very definition of mass and mass loss is less obvious than in flat spacetime .",
    "another conceptual issue is that the spacetime of a time - periodic qb is not asymptotically flat , which is related to the fact that the  total mass \" of a qb is infinite . in the case of spherical symmetry considered in this paper a suitable local mass function",
    "is the misner - sharp energy and the mass loss can be defined with aid of the kodama vector .",
    "the issue of the precise asymptotics of spacetimes can be sidestepped in the limit @xmath5 by considering only a restricted , approximatively flat spacetime region containing the core of the qb ( having a size of order @xmath6 ) and part of its oscillating tail .",
    "we find that to leading order in the @xmath2 expansion the oscillaton core is determined by the @xmath3-dimensional analogues of the schrdinger - newton equations @xcite independently of the self - interaction potential .",
    "it turns out that exponentially localized oscillatons exist for @xmath7 .",
    "these findings show a striking similarity to dilaton - scalar theories as found in ref .  @xcite . in the case of",
    "spherically symmetric oscillatons no gravitational radiation is expected due to birkhoff s theorem .",
    "the mass loss of spherically symmetric oscillatons is entirely due to scalar radiation .",
    "the following simple formula gives the mass loss of a small - amplitude oscillaton in @xmath3 spatial dimensions : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the mass of the scalar field , @xmath10 is a @xmath3-dependent constant , while @xmath11 depends on both @xmath3 and the self - interaction scalar potential .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath12 in the einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) theory for spatial dimensions @xmath13 are given in table [ ctable ] .",
    "we also compute and tabulate the most important physical properties of oscillatons in the ekg theory ( their mass as a function of time , their radii ) .",
    "we would like to stress , that the method is applicable for oscillatons in scalar theories with any self - interaction potential developable into power series .    in the seminal work of don n.  page @xcite",
    "both the classical and quantum decay rate of oscillatons has been considered for the case of free massive scalars in the ekg theory ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "we agree with the overall qualitative picture of the oscillaton s mass loss found in ref.@xcite , however , there are also some differences in the quantitative results . for example , the amplitude of the outgoing wave ( related to @xmath15 ) found by our method differs significantly from that of ref.@xcite .",
    "the main source of this discrepancy is due to the fact that this amplitude is given by an infinite series in the @xmath2 expansion , where all terms contribute by the same order , whereas in the estimate of ref.@xcite only the lowest order term in this series has been used .",
    "our methods which are based on the work of segur - kruskal @xcite avoid this difficulty altogether , moreover for the class of self - interaction potentials containing only even powers of the scalar field , @xmath16 , the radiation amplitude can be computed analytically using borel summation .",
    "we now give a lightning review on previous results scattered in the literature on oscillatons in 3 + 1 dimensions . for a given scalar field mass , @xmath9",
    ", there is a one - parameter family of oscillatons , parametrized , for example , by the central amplitude of the field , @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath17 increases from small values , the mass of the oscillaton , @xmath18 , is getting larger , while the radius of the configuration decreases . for a critical value of the central amplitude , @xmath19 ,",
    "a maximal mass configuration is reached .",
    "oscillatons with central amplitudes @xmath20 are unstable @xcite .",
    "this behavior is both qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to that of boson stars @xcite , and also to the behavior of white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite . for reviews of the vast literature on boson stars",
    "see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite a one - parameter family of oscillaton - type solutions in an einstein - scalar theory with two massive , real scalar fields has been presented , which are essentially transitional states between boson stars and oscillatons .",
    "the interaction of weak gravity axion field oscillatons with white dwarfs and neutron stars have been discussed in @xcite , proposing a possible mechanism for gamma ray bursts @xcite . since for very low mass scalar fields oscillatons",
    "may be extremely heavy , it has been suggested that they may be the central object of galaxies @xcite , or form the dark matter galactic halos @xcite .",
    "qualitatively good results for various properties of oscillatons has been obtained by urea - lpez @xcite , truncating the fourier mode decomposition of the field equations at as low order as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fundamental frequency .",
    "then the space and time dependence of the scalar field separates as @xmath23 .",
    "oscillatons with nontrivial self - interaction potentials have also been studied in @xcite , indicating that similarly to boson stars , the maximal mass can be significantly larger than in the klein - gordon case .",

    "the obtained value of the maximal mass by this higher order truncation is @xmath25 in planck units . for small - amplitude nearly minkowskian configurations spatial derivatives",
    "are also small , and in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and independently in @xcite ) it has been demonstrated that such nearly flat oscillatons can be described by a pair of coupled differential equations , the so called time independent the schrdinger - newton equations @xcite .",
    "these equations also describe the weak gravity limit of boson stars . for quantum mechanical motivations leading to the schrdinger - newton equations see @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of perturbed oscillatons has been investigated in detail by @xcite . for each mass smaller than the maximal oscillaton mass",
    "there are two oscillaton configurations .",
    "the one with the larger radius is a stable s - branch oscillaton , and the other is an unstable u - branch oscillaton . moderately perturbed s - branch oscillatons vibrate with a low frequency corresponding to a quasinormal mode .",
    "perturbed u - branch oscillatons collapse to black holes if the perturbation increases their mass , otherwise they migrate to an s - branch oscillaton .",
    "actually , u - branch oscillatons turn out to be the critical solutions for type i critical collapse of massive scalar fields @xcite .",
    "corresponding apparently periodic objects also form in the critical collapse of massive vector fields @xcite .",
    "there are also excited state oscillatons , indexed by the nodes of the scalar field .",
    "the instability and the decay of excited state oscillatons into black holes or s - branch oscillatons is described in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of oscillatons on a full 3d grid has been also performed in @xcite , calculating the emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "since @xmath26 gravity theories are equivalent to ordinary general relativity coupled to a real scalar field , oscillatons naturally form in these theories as well @xcite .",
