    "three mode parametric instability in large scale , high optical power gravitational wave detectors was predicted by braginsky _",
    "et al . _ in 2001 @xcite .",
    "all subsequent analyses @xcite relied on the model prediction where amplitudes of certain acoustic modes of the interferometer mirrors would grow exponentially once an instability threshold of input laser power is reached .",
    "it was generally considered that the exponential growth would eventually render the whole setup unstable and cause an interferometer to lose lock .",
    "this prognosis , however , relied on a linearised approximation of the 3-mode optomechanical interaction which is valid only for small amplitudes of acoustic and stokes modes . for larger values , it is intuitively obvious that non - linearity should ultimately modify this growth . if the optical configuration can be maintained one would expect that the acoustic and higher - order optical oscillations should saturate .",
    "knowing the amplitudes of such saturation effects as well as their timescale is of crucial importance for the operation of the real detectors now being implemented .",
    "it is hard to overestimate the significance of rigorous analysis of this phenomenon in large - scale gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "second generation detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite are at the the latest stages of construction and testing .",
    "these instruments are planned to have up to @xmath0  kw of circulating laser power in the arms .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the chance of 3-mode parametric instability at such high level of power is very high .",
    "similarly , other advanced detectors , advanced virgo @xcite , kagra @xcite and geo - hf@xcite , might be susceptible to this effect , though with different probability ( see review @xcite for details )",
    ".    therefore , knowledge of the temporal dynamics and the values of final amplitudes the three participating modes reach at the saturation stage allows to design a feedback control system to suppress this instability before it develops .",
    "several methods of mitigation this phenomenon were developed that can benefit from this information : ( i ) varying of the mirrors radii of curvature by heating @xcite ; ( ii ) decreasing acoustic modes q - factor @xcite ; ( iii ) introducing additional damping to acoustic modes via electrostatic feedback @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a full non - linear treatment of this problem for the large - scale gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "a similar approach has been used by polyakov and vyatchanin in @xcite to study the precursors of pi in the regime of input powers close to pi threshold . in this paper , we expand and generalise their treatment to arbitrary input power levels and investigate the time evolution of the amplitudes of stokes and pump optical modes as well as of acoustic mode .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that the set of dynamical equations in this work is similar to those in @xcite , yet we prove that the requirement on smallness of the mechanical mode amplitude ( allegedly , it has to be smaller than the optical modes linewidth ) stated therein is not necessary , and this model is valid for arbitrarily large acoustic amplitudes .    besides",
    ", similar effect has been observed and analysed in small - scale whispering - gallery - mode optical resonators used to create stable radio - frequency optomechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "recently , the saturation of unstable oscillations has been observed at uwa and in lkb in tabletop optomechanical experiment using a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity with a silicon nitride membrane acting as the acoustic resonator test mass @xcite . in that paper , we derived a similar model to back the experimental results . in this paper , we focus on a different physical system that comprises massive freely suspended fabry - prot cavities which interact with high - power optical field circulating inside .",
    "we also analyse the 3-mode parametric instability phenomenon in more detail and with greater generality .",
    "the physics of three mode parametric instability is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_dynamics ] .",
    "we consider a fabry - perot interferometer pumped at a laser frequency @xmath1 close to the resonance frequency , @xmath2 , of one of the fundamental modes @xcite .",
    "ultrasonic vibrations of the mirrors with frequency @xmath3 cause intracavity light to scatter into two motional sidebands , stokes , with frequency @xmath4 , and anti - stokes one , with frequency @xmath5 .",
    "as the fundamental mode linewidth @xmath6 is normally much smaller than @xmath3 , the amplitude of motional sidebands is normally not enhanced by the cavity .",
    "not so , however , if the sideband frequency coincides with one of the higher order optical mode ( hom ) frequencies .",
    "such modes exist in any fabry - perot cavity and populate densely the free spectral range between the fundamental modes ( see sec .",
    "3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the transverse spatial profile of such hom matches the profile of an acoustic vibration , the photons scattered into this mode from the fundamental mode build up , thereby channeling part of the optical power circulating in the fundamental mode to the hom .",
    "the beat note of the fundamental mode and the hom , creates a near - resonant radiation pressure force on the mirror at the frequency of acoustic mode , @xmath3 .",
    "now , there are two possibilities to consider .",
    "if hom frequency coincides ( approximately ) with anti - stokes sideband frequency , @xmath7 , the radiation pressure force will be applied out of phase with the acoustic vibrations , thereby damping them @xcite .",
    "this effect is analogous to radiation pressure cooling @xcite , where the scattered stokes photon energy is a sum of the fundamental mode energy and the acoustic mode phonon energy , _ i.e. _ @xmath8 .",
    "the instability we are studying in this paper , on the contrary , occurs when the hom frequency matches the stokes sideband frequency @xmath9 : @xmath10 . to distinguish this hom from others",
    "we will call it hereinafter a stokes mode . in this case ,",
    "radiation pressure force of the beat note is in phase with the acoustic oscillations , leading to amplification .",
    "this , in turn , makes amplitude of the stokes sideband larger , thereby increasing the amplitude of the radiation pressure force .",
    "so , the loop closes and the instability breaks out . an illuminating description of this process in terms of feedback control theory can be found in the work of evans _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the picture above gives no account for natural decay of the stokes mode and acoustic oscillations due to loss , characterised by stokes mode linewidth @xmath11 stokes and acoustic mode decay rate @xmath12 .",
    "these loss mechanisms counterbalance the instability , and for circulating power below the certain threshold ( see below ) , there is no instability .",
    "however , as soon as the power circulating in the fundamental mode , reaches this threshold value , the 3-mode instability sets on .",
    "very similar process happens in optical parametric oscillators , where above certain threshold pump power , in the presence of strong kerr non - linearity of the medium , pump photons scatter into pairs of _ idler _ and _ signal _ photons @xcite .",
    "this process resembles a relief valve operation , when above certain pressure the valve opens and redirects the excess fluid flow into a reserve pipe , keeping the main pipe pressure constant .",
    "similarly , above the instability threshold , all the excess optical power is redirected from the fundamental mode to the stokes mode and the acoustic mode oscillations .",
    "new steady state amplitudes of all three participating modes are reached when the balance of power is restored in the system , meaning that the amount of power pumped into the system matches the sum power leaving it through the three decay channels , characterised by the decay rates of the two optical modes , @xmath6 and @xmath11 , and a mechanical decay rate , @xmath12 .    in this paper , we present a non - linear theory of the 3-mode parametric instability in large scale gravitational wave interferometers with free suspended mirrors .",
    "we derive and solve equations of motion for 3 participating modes amplitudes and obtain their temporal dynamics . to characterise the behaviour of unstable modes , we calculate values of new steady - state amplitudes and give an estimate of instability development timescale .",

    "as shown in @xcite , the above consideration of 3-mode parametric instability in fabry - prot applies to each of these modes with the following substitutions of parameters : @xmath145\\,,\\\\ \\kappa_s & \\to\\kappa_{s\\pm } = \\kappa_s\\re\\left[\\dfrac{1-\\rho_{p , s}e^{2i\\phi^s_{p , s}}}{1+\\rho^s_{p , s}e^{2i\\phi_{p , s}}}\\right]\\,,\\\\ \\delta_m & \\to\\delta_m + \\delta_\\pm = \\delta_m + \\kappa_0\\im\\left[\\dfrac{1-\\rho_{p , s}e^{2i\\phi_{p , s}}}{1+\\rho_{p , s}e^{2i\\phi_{p , s}}}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 are ( amplitude ) reflectivities of power and signal recycling mirrors , respectively , ( with @xmath147 being more habitual power transmissivities thereof ) , and @xmath148 are propagation phase shifts light of frequency @xmath149 acquires propagating the distance @xmath150 from arm cavities input test masses ( itms ) to the prm and srm , respectively .",
    "here `` + '' sign stands for values that refer to symmetric mode , and `` @xmath151 '' sign indicates those of anti - symmetric one .",
    "one can notice that the new linewidths ratio @xmath152 may be different from the one for the simple fabry - prot , as phase shifts @xmath153 deviate from @xmath154 , _",
    "i.e. _ the fact that fundamental mode is resonant in pr / sr cavity does not mean that the same is true for the stokes mode .",
    "the difference is @xmath155 which might be significant for @xmath156 metres long pr / sr cavities planned for advanced ligo .",
    "asymmetry in interferometer arms does not change the general conclusion of this section , for the dual recycled interferometer can still be represented as two independent fabry - prot interferometers , as shown in @xcite . in this case , however , normal modes of the asymmetric system are not pure _ symmetric _ and _ anti - symmetric _ combinations of fields in the arm cavities , but a general linear combination thereof ( cf . section 2.6 of @xcite )",
    "in this work , we analysed , using full non - linear treatment , the dynamics of 3-mode optomechanical instability in large - scale gravitational wave interferometers with freely suspended optics .",
    "it turns out that intrinsic non - linearity of the 3-mode interaction does not allow excited unstable optical and acoustic mode amplitudes to grow unbounded , rather it makes them saturate to the new steady state values .",
    "these values are governed by 3 dimensionless parameters : parametric gain , @xmath76 , normalised frequency mismatch ( detuning ) , @xmath157 , and the ratio of optical linewidths @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , our theory can be equally applied to simple fabry - prot interferometers and to complex dual recycled interferometers of the second generation gravitational wave detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , kagra @xcite and geo - hf@xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the process of instability development is quite slow for large scale detectors , lasting for many relaxation times of the acoustic modes , which , due to very high q factors of these modes , amounts to hundreds to thousands of seconds .",
    "such a long onset time allows for efficient control and mitigation of this type of instability .",
    "moreover , for reasonable values of pi gain , @xmath159 , consistent with recent parametric instability modelling for advanced ligo interferometers @xcite , acoustic mode amplitudes should not exceed nanometre level .",
    "basing on this point as well as on the fact that the small - scale membrane - in - the - middle interferometer in uwa where pi was observed experimentally in the non - linear regime @xcite did not loose lock , one can presume that the same would be the case for a large - scale gw detector .",
    "however , there remains a high level of uncertainty pertaining to a greater complexity of an electronic control of a large interferometer .",
    "the response of the electronic control system to a slump of circulating power in the arms when pi starts to develop deserves a separate study .",
    "it should be also noted that our theory assumes fixed , time - independent values of mode frequencies and optomechanical coupling . in real interferometers with suspended optics mirrors",
    "tend to move around slowly and a laser beam spot does not rest at a fixed position on a mirror surface .",
    "this results in slow compared to acoustic frequencies modulation of the frequencies of the stokes modes and thereby of the mismatch parameter , @xmath160 , and of the pi gain @xmath161 and of modes overlap factor @xmath162 , leading to reduced chance of instability .",
    "the effect of such modulation will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
