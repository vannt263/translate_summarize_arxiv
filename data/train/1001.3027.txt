    "thus charge and rotation contribute relatively less to the total energy for these `` many sphaleron '' configurations ( e.g.  only 8% for @xmath96 as compared to 30% for @xmath34 ) .",
    "consequently , the rotating multisphaleron configurations turn into bound states beyond some critical value of the angular momentum .",

    "such a spreading of the energy density with increasing charge is also seen in dyons , for instance , and we attribute this effect to the presence of charge and the associated repulsion .",
    "indeed , this spreading becomes quite pronounced for large values of the charge .",
    "the expected effect of the presence of angular momentum , on the other hand , is a centrifugal shift of the energy density .",
    "indeed , we observe , that with increasing angular momentum the torus - like region of large energy density moves further outward to larger values of @xmath101 .    the modulus of the higgs field of the multisphaleron solutions has a single node at the origin , from where it starts to increase linearly in the direction of the symmetry axis , to reach its vacuum expectation value at infinity . in the equatorial plane , in constrast ,",
    "the modulus of the higgs field starts to inrease from the origin much slower ( i.e. , only with power @xmath102 ) .",

    "we note , that the precise evolution of the isolated nodes on the symmetry axis and the vortex rings in the bulk with increasing @xmath1 is sensitive to the value of the higgs mass @xcite .    in the following we demonstrate the effect of charge and rotation on these sphaleron - antisphaleron systems by focussing on the configurations with @xmath99 and @xmath104 .",
    "the static solutions have been constructed before @xcite .",
    "for the chosen parameters , the modulus of the higgs field of the static @xmath36 configuration vanishes only on a ring in the equatorial plane .",

    "the static @xmath107 configuration has only two symmetrical vortex rings . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the two symmetrical vortex rings are supplemented by a node at the origin , and for @xmath109 two symmetrical vortex rings and two inner nodes on the symmetry axis are present .",
    "again we first discuss the global properties of these solutions , following the above scheme .",
    "since only the integer @xmath1 ( but not @xmath5 ) enters the relation between the charge and the angular momentum , we continue to show all quantities versus the scaled relative angular momentum @xmath86 .",

    "we therefore consider the relative energy @xmath111 , i.e. , the energy per constituent .",

    "the tori of the angular momentum density are spatially related to the tori of the energy density . in particular ,",
    "the location of the positive tori is associated with the location of the tori of the energy density , with the negative tori inbetween .",
    "finally , we would like to address the question of the equilibrium of such composite configurations as sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs and more general sphaleron - antisphaleron systems .",
    "as discussed previously @xcite , a necessary condition for the equilibrium of such axially symmetric configurations is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the respective component of the stress energy tensor and @xmath115 is the equatorial plane .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , the net force between the constituents in the upper and in the lower hemisphere vanishes , thus yielding equilibrium .",
    "if @xmath114 vanishes everywhere in the equatorial plane , this condition is met trivially , if on the other hand @xmath114 does not identically vanish , the various contributions to the surface integral ( [ tzz ] ) must precisely cancel each other . to understand how the equilibrium condition is satisfied in these sphaleron - antisphaleron systems , we have extracted the @xmath114 component of the stress energy tensor .",
    "we illustrate @xmath114 for two rather different configurations in fig .",
    "[ f-5 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f-5]a we display @xmath114 for the static sphaleron - antisphaleron pair in the upper hemisphere . in the equatorial plane @xmath114",

    "[ f-5]c . here",
    "@xmath114 is small , but finite ( except when it changes sign ) . to gain further insight into how the equilibrium results from the various forces present in the system , we consider the contributions from the respective parts of the lagrangian separately .",
    "we exhibit these also in fig .",
    "we note , that the positive contribution from the @xmath14 gauge field part almost cancels the negative contributions from the @xmath15 and higgs parts , yielding in total a @xmath114 which is almost but not quite vanishing in the equatorial plane . in the inner region",
    "the total @xmath114 is slightly positive , while in the outer region it is slightly negative , yielding together a vanishing surface integral ( [ tzz ] ) , within the numerical accuracy .",
    "the situation is similar for the sphaleron - antisphaleron chain , consisting of four constituents ( @xmath107 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "also , the inclusion of rotation does not change this overall behaviour of these types of solutions . for most other systems , however , @xmath114 does not nearly vanish in the equatorial plane .",

    "the features of @xmath114 seen here , are very typical , and hardly change with rotation , since the effect of rotation is basically a slight shift in magnitude .",
