    "elliptical galaxies represent a fascinating combination of complexity and regularity .",
    "a leading theory for the origin of early - type galaxies is based on mergers of disk galaxies @xcite and likely involves gas dissipation , star formation , and supermassive black hole feedback @xcite in addition to stellar dynamics . despite their complex origins ,",
    "early - type galaxies obey a regular set of scaling relations that connect their photometric and kinematic properties , most notably the relation between effective radius @xmath9 , central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 , and average central surface brightness @xmath11 known as the fundamental plane ( fp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath12    the virial theorem can be used to calculate this relation for homologous systems , which gives @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* hereafter the ",
    "virial scaling  ) .    while the observational determination of the fp was originally motivated as a precise distance indicator to improve upon the previously known luminosity ( @xmath15 )  velocity dispersion ( @xmath10 ) relation @xcite , the importance of the fp scalings and its correspondingly small scatter for theories of elliptical galaxy formation was also realized .",
    "the first observationally determined fp scalings ( @xmath16,@xmath17 , at optical wavelengths ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) differed from the virial scaling , indicating a `` tilt '' relative to the expectation for homologous systems .",
    "the fp tilt implied that the mass  to  light ratio @xmath18 likely varies as a function of galaxy mass or luminosity as @xmath19 within the range @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite noted that deviations from the fp can be induced by @xmath21 variance owing to e.g. metallicity or age trends in stellar populations , dynamical or structural properties , and the relative distribution of dark and baryonic matter . in principle , each of these effects may also introduce a systematic tilt into the observed fp if they vary as a function of elliptical galaxy mass .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to gauge the importance of various contributions to the tilt in the observed fp in the context of the scenario where elliptical galaxies form from mergers . using hundreds of simulated galaxy mergers that include the physics of gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , and black hole accretion and feedback , we determine that gas dissipation may significantly contribute to the tilt of the observed fp , in addition to tilt induced by @xmath21 trends from stellar populations .",
    "we propose that elliptical galaxies initially form in gas - rich mergers from disk galaxy progenitors whose gas fractions exceed @xmath22 , and show that these remnants display substantial fp tilt .",
    "we connect the origin of this tilt to the central stellar phase - space density of the remnants .",
    "in small mass systems where dissipation is most important , the stellar phase - space density of remnants increases substantially in high - gas fraction mergers .",
    "the central stellar phase - space density in massive ellipticals remains similar in mergers with varying gas fractions , with their stars on average obtaining lower phase - space densities than reached in smaller systems .",
    "this mass - dependent phase - space density trend translates into a mass - dependent trend in the ratio of total mass to stellar mass @xmath8 in the central regions of ellipticals and a corresponding tilt in the fp .",
    "we then explain this mass - dependent importance of dissipation in terms of the inefficient cooling of collisionally heated gas in massive ellipticals and the dynamically varying gas consumption timescale of smaller systems .",
    "it is interesting , and possibly significant , that the gas fraction required to reproduce the observed tilt in the fp is , as discussed by @xcite similar to that needed for mergers of disks to yield the high central phase space densities of ellipticals .    in accord with other work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that subsequent dissipationless merging between spheroidal galaxies roughly maintains the fp tilt .",
    "moreover , we find that a single generation of dissipationless re - merging of remnants will induce scatter in the @xmath23 relation but will not destroy the correlation , as spheroidal galaxy mergers also do not dramatically alter the @xmath24 relation when viewed as a mass - sequence .",
    "possible dry merging between spheroidal galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 as indicated by recent observations @xcite is thus not expected to destroy tight fp or @xmath23 relations generated during spheroid formation through gas - rich mergers at higher redshifts .",

    "scaling laws describing the regularity of the properties of elliptical galaxies have been known since at least @xcite , who reported a relation between their potential energy @xmath32 and mass @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "even earlier , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dv ) had demonstrated that ellipticals generally have a surface brightness profile @xmath35 , at least over some range in radius @xmath36 , and implications of the dv profile for the mass - dependent properties of ellipticals were recognized before the @xcite paper ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found a color  magnitude relation for virgo and coma cluster ellipticals ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite showed that the surface brightnesses and effective radii of ellipticals correlate with galaxy luminosity and with one another ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "important early indications that a second parameter ( in addition to mass ) governs the properties of ellipticals came with the @xcite and @xcite work that implied a correlation of @xmath38 and absorption - line strength luminosity relation ( @xmath39 ) residuals . while these findings were later contradicted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that elliptical galaxies were not a one - parameter family remained an important possibility .",
    "the discovery of the fp @xcite definitively revealed that elliptical galaxy properties are set by at least two parameters .",
    "specifically , ellipticals were found to obey a relation between @xmath9 , @xmath37 , and @xmath11 as given by equation ( [ eqn : fp ] ) , with less than half the scatter of the @xcite @xmath38 relation .",
    "the small scatter of the fp was immediately noticed , implying that the process of elliptical galaxy formation must result in a very regular mass - sequence .",
    "@xcite noted that mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath18 ) variations can influence observations of the fp by inducing tilt relative to the plane defined by the virial relation .",
    "much of the subsequent work on the fp has centered around possible causes of @xmath18 variation or other origins for tilting the fp relative to the virial plane .",
    "numerous subsequent observations verified and improved the fp relation for ellipticals @xcite and extended the fp determinations to higher redshifts @xcite . while the specific details may vary , these works generally conclude that    * a tight fundamental plane between the elliptical galaxy properties @xmath9 , @xmath37 , @xmath11 exists , and extends in some form to at least redshift @xmath40 . * ellipticals are old , with formation redshifts @xmath41 , and their color evolution , which controls the fp normalization , is roughly consistent with passive evolution of their stellar populations . * some of the fp tilt must originate from the change in stellar population @xmath18 with galaxy mass , but the extent to which stellar populations contribute to @xmath18-induced fp tilt is debated .    of specific interest to modelers",
    "are the observations that made definite statements about the influence of structural or kinematic nonhomology on @xmath18 and the fp tilt , especially those that conclude directly that these nonhomologies are either unimportant or of minor significance @xcite , significant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or of possible but as yet not fully determined importance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* for a description of early results ) .",

    "analytical models of elliptical galaxies have also been formulated @xcite , aiding the interpretation of both the observational and simulation results . in what follows ,",
    "we combine features of many of these previous theoretical endeavors by simulating mergers between dissipational and dissipationless disk galaxies , spheroidal systems , and merger remnants to determine their fundamental scaling relations .",
    "galaxy merging combines much complex physics , including e.g. the collisionless dynamics of dark matter and stars , gas dissipation , star formation , and feedback from supernovae and black hole growth . while each of these processes may in principle be essential for determining merger remnant properties , their relative importance has not been fully established . by comparing the structure of merger remnants in simulations which systematically include or exclude various processes , we attempt to both test the merger hypothesis and identify the most important physical mechanisms .    to this end",
