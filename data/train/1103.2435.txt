    "thus , in general there is a difference between @xmath25 and @xmath32 , and they both differ , in the sense of the sum rule , from the mixed - state geometric phase in ref .  @xcite .",
    "uhlmann s quantum holonomy along density operators is a concept that allows for studies of geometric phases of general quantum states undergoing arbitrary quantum evolutions .",
    "its relevance to various aspects of physics have been demonstrated in the past , such as for open system evolution @xcite , interferometry @xcite , many - body quantum systems @xcite , as well as for yang - mills theory @xcite and thomas precession in special relativity @xcite .",
    "these works have been triggered in part by the need to test the conjectured resilience of holonomic quantum gates for quantum computation to various kinds of errors , such as noise and decoherence .",
    "recently , a first experimental test of the related uhlmann geometric phase , utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance techniques , has been carried out @xcite .    here ,",
    "we have analyzed uhlmann s quantum holonomy by considering a physical model system in which the uhlmann holonomies for @xmath0-coupled hydrogen - like atoms in a slowly rotating magnetic field have been computed .",
    "we have shown that the holonomy of the total angular momentum has abelian structure .",
    "furthermore , its corresponding phase is exactly the associated standard geometric phase@xcite for open or closed paths on the parameter sphere of magnetic field directions . for the holonomies of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 subsystems , we have shown that , in analogy with the lvay geometric phase defined for two - qubit systems @xcite , depending on whether the energy eigenstate of the whole system is a product state or an entangled state , the corresponding holonomies are abelian or non - abelian , respectively . in the case of entangled states",
    ", there is an explicit dependence of the gauge field vector potential on the concurrence @xcite , which interpolates the standard abelian ( berry ) and non - abelian ( wilczek - zee ) cases . in other words",
    ", our analysis demonstrates that the rich geometrical nature of the uhlmann holonomy incorporates as a limiting case the wilczek - zee holonomy , which is characterized by maximum quantum entanglement between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 subsystems .    in the analysis of the phase of the wilson loop variable associated with the uhlmann holonomy , we have pointed out that this phase , unlike the mixed - state geometric phase @xcite , possesses a non - abelian structure and",
    "may therefore be non - zero even for loops on the parameter sphere that enclose no net area .",
    "we have also elucidated that the phases of the wilson loop variables of the corresponding uhlmann holonomies for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 subsystems add up to that of the whole system for specific paths ; for other paths the sum may differ by @xmath3 from the berry phase of the whole system .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work analyzing the relation between the uhlmann holonomy and the mixed - state geometric phase all employ a notion of uhlmann phase [ see eq .",
    "( [ uhlmannphase0 ] ) ] which differs both conceptually and numerically from the phase of the wilson loop variable associated with the uhlmann holonomy , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ uhlmannphase ] ) .",
    "this alternative concept is the phase of the hilbert - schmidt overlap between the initial and the parallel transported final uhlmann amplitude . in ref .  @xcite it was also pointed out that other definitions of mixed - state geometric phases , which differ both from the geometric phase considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and the ( hilbert - schmidt ) uhlmann phase are in principle possible and experimentally relevant .",
    "it is important that these different definitions of mixed - state geometric phases be thoroughly investigated and compared with the phases associated to the uhlmann holonomy in model systems , where exact or computationally feasible solutions exist .",
    "our paper is a contribution in this direction .    the results for the phase of the wilson loop variable suggest it would be of interest to test the relation between this phase and various mixed - state geometric phases experimentally .",
    "this would further improve our understanding of the relation between the uhlmann holonomy @xcite and the mixed - state geometric phase @xcite .",
    "it would also help shed light on which of these phases is the most robust and , at the same time , the most accessible experimentally and the most amenable to external manipulation .",
