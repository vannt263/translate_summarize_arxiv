    "in this article , we will discuss photoproduction of high transverse momentum pions from polarized initial states .",
    "there are three motivations for doing so .",
    "one is the opportunity to learn the polarization distribution of quarks and gluons in nucleons .",
    "we will show that pion photoproduction with polarized initial states has , over a wide kinematic region of moderate transverse momentum pions , a large sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution functions of the target . within this wide kinematic region",
    "there are broad circumstances where the known polarized quark distributions all give similar pion photoproduction contributions , so that differences among the results are due mainly to the polarized gluon distributions .",
    "hence data where rather ordinary mesons are produced can select among the various models for this quantity .",
    "another motivation , which we have written something about earlier  @xcite , comes from the kinematic region of very high transverse momentum pions where the gluon contributions are small but the differences among the various models for the polarized quark distributions are significant . hence examining different kinematic regions of pion photoproduction yields information about both polarized quark and polarized gluon distributions .",
    "a third motivation , also dependent upon the highest transverse momentum pions , is the possibility of learning something about the pion distribution amplitude . in this region ,",
    "ratios of cross sections determine the target s quark distributions , but the magnitude of the cross section depends upon the same integral involving the pion distribution amplitude that enters the pion electromagnetic form factor of the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "hence if one looks at the unpolarized case , where the target distributions are fairly well known , one has another measure of this integral .",
    "( pion photoproduction in the unpolarized case has been well and successfully studied theoretically and experimentally  @xcite , but not at the highest transverse momenta where the pions will be dominantly produced in a short distance process rather than via fragmentation  @xcite . )    presently , information on polarized quark distributions comes from deep inelastic electron or muon scattering with polarized beams and targets  @xcite .",
    "single arm measurements of @xmath0 give information about a charge - squared weighted combination of polarized quark distributions .",
    "obtaining polarized distributions of individual flavors is not possible from this data alone , but requires extra theoretical input in the analysis .",
    "coincidence measurements of @xmath2 give more information and have been reported  @xcite .",
    "this data , for a proton or deuteron target , gives different linear combinations of up and down quark polarized distributions , allowing a flavor decomposition without further theoretical input  @xcite .",
    "polarized gluon distributions are not well determined at present . something is learned from  @xcite the measurements of @xmath0 , but gluons contribute to @xmath0 only in higher order or through their effects upon the evolution of the polarized quark distributions .",
    "the analyses of @xmath0 can be abetted by perturbative qcd considerations at high @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "overall , however , the present constraints upon the polarized gluon distributions are not great and there is a large variance among @xmath4 models , as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ polglue7 ] .",
    "the process we discuss , @xmath5 ( where the photon is real and targets other than protons are possible ) , gives a complementary way to find the polarized quark distributions and is sensitive to the gluon distributions in leading order .",
    "the perturbative qcd that we use in the analysis is justified on the basis of high meson transverse momentum , rather than by high virtuality of an exchanged photon , and the experiment is a single arm experiment rather than a coincidence one .",
    "good data can in fact come as a by - product of a @xmath0 experiment since the detectors that measure the final electron or muon can also pick up charged hadrons ; recall that if the final lepton is not measured , the form of the cross section ensures that the virtuality of the exchanged photon will in general be rather low .",
    "-0.1 in 2.7 in 0.05 in    there are several processes that produce pions . at the highest transverse momenta ,",
    "mesons are produced by short range processes illustrated in fig .",
    "[ direct ] .",
    "we call these direct processes because the photon interacts directly with the target partons and also the pion is produced immediately .",
    "( the word `` direct '' was used with a similar meaning in a @xmath6 context by brodsky and berger long ago  @xcite . )",
    "direct processes are amenable to perturbative qcd calculation  @xcite and produce mesons that are kinematically isolated in the direction they emerge .",
    "these processes possess several nice features .",
    "one is that if the pion three - momentum is measured , no integrals are needed to calculate the differential cross section .",
    "in particular , the momentum fraction @xmath3 of the struck quark is fixed by measurable quantities .",
    "formulas for @xmath3 were given in  @xcite and will be repeated below , this time including mass corrections .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of deep inelastic lepton scattering , where experimentally measurable quantities , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , determine the quark momentum fraction by @xmath9 .",
    "another nice feature is that the asymmetry for the meson production subprocess is easy to calculate and is large .",
    "finally , mesons of a given flavor come mainly from quarks of a given flavor . hence in the region where the direct process dominates",
    ", we can choose which flavor quark we study the polarization distribution of .",
    "note that the high transverse momentum region involves only the high @xmath3 quarks and that the various models for the quark distributions separate from each other at high @xmath3 .    at moderate pion transverse momentum ,",
    "the main process is one we call the fragmentation process .",
    "the photon does interact directly with the partons of the target , but the meson is produced by fragmentation of one of the final state quarks or gluons .",
    "this time , an integration is needed to calculate the cross section , but any given model makes a definite prediction that can be compared to data . unlike the case for @xmath0 , interactions involving the gluons in the target",
    "contribute to the cross section in lowest order .",
    "one of the important subprocesses is photon - gluon fusion , @xmath10 .",
    "the polarization asymmetry of this process is very large . indeed , neglecting masses , it is @xmath11% : the process only goes if the photon and gluon have opposite helicity .",
    "hence this process is even more significant for the polarization asymmetry than it is overall .",
    "there are situations where the results excluding the gluon polarization are close to the same for all the modern parton distribution function models or parameterizations .",
    "then the differences among the results from different models are due to the polarized gluon distributions , and the differences over the spectrum of available models are large . hence , the data will adjudicate among the different suggest polarized gluons distributions .",
    "there is also the resolved photon process , where the photon turns into hadronic material before interacting with the target .",
    "we will discuss it in some detail below .",
    "however , for the kinematic situations we highlight , the resolved photon contributions are below both the fragmentation and direct contributions .",
    "calculational details are outlined in the following section .",
    "some results and tests of the calculations are outlined in the next following section .",
    "then , in section  [ polarized ] , we show results involving polarized initial states , in particular showing how sensitive the results are the the different models for the polarized parton distributions and how well they could be extracted from the data .",
    "some conclusions will be given in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "there are three categories of processes that contribute to pion photoproduction and we call them fragmentation processes , direct processes , and resolved photon processes .    fragmentation processes have quarks and gluons produced in short range reactions followed by fragmentation at long distances of either a quark or a gluon to produce the observed pion .",
    "the short distance part of the process is perturbatively calculated and the long distance part is parameterized as a fragmentation function for partons into pions . direct processes , in our nomenclature ,",
    "occur when the pion is produced in a short range reaction via a radiated gluon giving a quark - antiquark pair , one of which joins the initial quark to produce the pion .",
    "this process is perturbatively calculable , given the distribution of initial quarks , and produces isolated pions rather than pions as part of a jet .",
    "the direct process can dominate the fragmentation process for very high transverse momentum pions .",
    "resolved photon processes are photons fluctuating into hadrons , most simply a quark - antiquark pair , which then interact with the partons of the target .",
    "the resolved photon processes can be important for high initial energy , especially for pions produced backward in the center of mass .",
    "fragmentation processes , of which one example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fragmentation ] , are important over a wide range of kinematics for the present paper , and we start by recording the relevant formulas  @xcite . in general ,",
    "if the photon interacts directly with a constituent of target @xmath12 but the pion is produced as part of a jet ,    0.5 in 1.2 in    @xmath13    here , @xmath3 is the ( light - cone ) momentum fraction of the target carried by the struck parton @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the fraction of the parton @xmath16 s momentum that goes into the pion , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the mandelstam variables for the subprocess @xmath20 .",

    "the asymmetry for the quark target is positive and the asymmetry for the gluon target is @xmath11% .",
    "-0.1 in 0.9 in 1.1 in    for the direct process , the subprocess is shown in fig .",

    "finally , in this case @xmath57 and @xmath18 is the same as @xmath25 .",
    "the direct process is higher twist , nominally suppressed by a factor of scale @xmath58 .",
    "however , for very high transverse momentum pions it is the dominant production process . when it is the dominant process , one can take advantage of the nice feature that the momentum fraction @xmath3 of the struck quark is completely determined by experimentally measurable quantities . with @xmath59 and estimating mass corrections with a proportional mass approximation",

    "the proportional mass approximation just described has the virtues of being simple and of giving the same kinematic limits from thresholds and energy conservation for the subprocess as for the overall process .",

    "average fractions of the photon momentum carried by its partons are @xmath104=0.69 for the lowest pion momentum in fig.5 , 0.8 for momentum 15 gev and 0.9 for momentum 24 gev . because of these large values of @xmath104 , we neglected a possible gluon fusion process ( @xmath105 ) .",

    "0.1 in 2.24 in    0.05 in    one sees that the cross section falls quickly with increasing pion momentum .",
    "the fragmentation process is the main one at lower pion momenta , and the direct process takes over above about 26 gev for this particular angle and incoming energy .",

    "the reason for its fast increase involves the lower average @xmath107 possible at higher energies , as well as the reduced kinematic constraint upon a three step ( three integrals in the calculation ) process as the energy increases .    the @xmath108 ratio off proton and neutron targets is shown in fig .  [ pionrat50 ] , again for 50 gev incoming electrons .",

    "[ n - pi_50gev_g ] , where we use only one quark distribution , but six different gluon distributions to show the differences in their effect upon this asymmetry .",
    "two of the new polarized gluon distributions are from ball , forte , and ridolfi ( bfr )  @xcite , and we use versions ar and os .",
    "( neither bbs nor bfr give quark distributions for each individual flavor quark and antiquark , so we can show results from their gluon distributions only in combination with other authors s models for the quarks . )",
    "the other new polarized gluon distribution is gs version c. one can see that the available polarized gluon distributions , all inferred from @xmath0 data , sometimes abetted by pqcd considerations at high x  @xcite , give distinct results in the present case .",
    "incidentally , the minimum @xmath3 that enters the calculation of the fragmentation process is the same as the unique @xmath3 that enters the direct process , eqn .",

    "hence for the situation of figs .",
    "[ n - pi_50gev ] or  [ n - pi_50gev_g ] , the minimum @xmath3 for pion momentum @xmath146 gev is @xmath147 and for @xmath148 gev , @xmath149 .",
    "this gives some idea of the @xmath3 range that is probed by these experiments .",

    "the electron energy is still @xmath150 gev and @xmath136 .",
    "the @xmath114 curves , which are the lower ones in this figure , bunch very well at low @xmath30 for the three curves with @xmath132 set to zero , and the curves using the @xmath132 pertinent to each model are quite distinct .",
    "the @xmath102 curves are less distinct from each other , but it is still true that for the models chosen the curves with @xmath145 all lie , at low @xmath30 , above the curves with gluon polarization included .",
    "3.4 in    0.1 in    the next three figures show the analogs of the preceding three figures but for an incoming electron energy of 27.5 gev ; the lab angle is still @xmath136 .",
    "[ n - pi_27gev ] shows the asymmetry @xmath128 for @xmath52 production off a neutron target for the three models we have chosen , with and without @xmath132 .",
    "[ p - pi_27gev ] does the same for a proton target .",
    "the figure with one quark distribution model but six polarized gluon distribution models is fig  [ p - pi_27gev_g ] .",
    "it is the analog of fig .",
    "[ n - pi_50gev_g ] , but for variation we have given this figure with a proton instead of a neutron target .",
    "we feel we have demonstrated that with polarized initial states , pion photoproduction at low ( but still with @xmath142 above about 1 gev ) and moderate pion momenta can be a useful and successful way to learn about the polarized gluon distribution . in this region ,",
    "the various models for the polarized quark distributions all give rather similar results when the effects of the polarized gluon distributions are removed .",
    "the effects of the polarized gluon distributions are distinct for the different models , and particularly for the bbs  @xcite and bfr  @xcite models are quite large . for the kinematics we have looked at , the resolved photon contributions are always small . in the low to moderate @xmath30 region ,",
    "the fragmentation contribution is dominant .    at the highest allowed pion momentum",
    "the asymmetry does become sensitive to the differences among the various quark models , and so can empirically distinguish among them .",
    "what we call the direct process , i.e. , pion production at short distance rather than via fragmentation , dominates in this region . in particular , the high @xmath3 quarks of the target",
    "give the dominant contributions and the models for the polarized quark distributions do not agree at high @xmath3 .",
    "3.4 in    0.1 in    questions may be asked about the use of perturbative qcd , upon which our analyses depend .",
    "we are , of course , mainly considering ratios of cross sections so that many potential problems cancel out .",
    "also , studies of the polarized gluon distribution depend mainly upon the fragmentation process .",
    "this is a leading twist process , so using perturbation theory to calculate it should be accurate and has not generally been questioned .    within the context of perturbation theory",
    ", one may ask how large the higher order in @xmath90 corrections are . for the unpolarized case , the answer is that the next to leading corrections double the result  @xcite .",
    "we should state that we have simply doubled our lowest order calculations to obtain our results : remember we are taking ratios .",
    "we are not aware of nlo calculations of @xmath151 or @xmath152 .",
    "however , nlo calculations of @xmath153 and @xmath154 and related @xmath155 processes have been done  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath156-factors [ ratio of lo + nlo to lo cross sections ] for the polarized cross section @xmath157 always exceed unity , so that the effect of the nlo corrections upon the ratio @xmath128 for direct photon production is not great .    3.4 in    0.1 in    much of our further discussion concerns the direct process , which is a higher twist contribution and using perturbative qcd has been questioned is some such cases .",
    "we can for completeness summarize some earlier arguments  @xcite .",
    "our analysis requires that the `` @xmath158 '' in @xmath159 is out of the resonance region . for the energies we have considered , this is easy to satisfy except at the highest @xmath30 .",
    "another question regards further higher twist corrections , for example , corrections due to the quarks in the pion having finite momentum transverse to the pion s overall momentum .",
    "this has been much studied in the context of the pion electromagnetic form factor  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the virtual gluon in the direct process is much farther off shell  @xcite than for the pion form factor at presently accessible kinematics .",
    "hence higher twist effects will be less significant for measurable photoproduction of high transverse momentum mesons than for meson form factors at any currently measured momentum transfers .",
    "similarly , we have not considered transverse momentum smearing of the incoming quarks .",
    "it has been considered in the context of pion production in @xmath160 and @xmath161 collsions , and does have some effect there on the extraction of the polarized gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "perturbative corrections that are higher order in @xmath90 have not been calculated .",
    "they may be calculated along the lines of  @xcite for the @xmath162 and of  @xcite for the @xmath52 electromagnetic form factors .",
    "for both of these , using the asymptotic distribution amplitude and a suitable choice of renormalization scale , the magnitude of the correction was about 20% , decreasing the @xmath162 and increasing the @xmath52 form factors .",
    "our calculations can also be applied to production of kaons and to neutral pions . for neutral pions ,",
    "the fragmentation process cross section is the average of the @xmath102 and @xmath114 cross sections .",
    "however , the direct production of neutral pions is less than the direct production of either charged pion .",
    "useful studies are also possible using single polarization asymmetries .",
    "we hope to return to these subjects in the near future .",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "* of the three processes that contribute to high @xmath142 pion production , or to its single arm electron equivalent @xmath163 , the resolved photon process is unimportant for incoming energies of a few 10 s of gev and small angles .",
    "the fragmentation process dominates at low or moderate momenta , the direct process dominates at high pion momenta . *",
    "the @xmath108 ratio predictions are different for fragmentation and direct processes . for isoscalar or near isoscalar targets , with pions at high momenta",
    ", fragmentation would give about a 4:1 ratio [ coming from @xmath118 ] but the direct process gives about 1:1 .",
    "verification that short distance production takes over from fragmentation production lies in seeing a fall in the @xmath108 ratio ( still for @xmath165 targets ) as the takeover occurs . * where the direct process dominates , and without polarization , the rate is proportional to things that are known and the @xmath50 , the same integral over the pion distribution amplitude that fixes @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "currently data for the last two processes taken at face value gives discordant values of @xmath50 . * with initial state polarization , one can form the double helicity asymmetry @xmath129 or @xmath128 .",
    "where the direct process dominates , at high pion momentum , the asymmetry is proportional to the polarized quark distributions @xmath168 for the @xmath102 and @xmath169 for the @xmath114 , times things that are known or easily calculable .",
    "hence , one can measure the @xmath170 individually .",
    "* when the fragmentation process dominates , experiments with initial state polarization are sensitive to @xmath132 .",
    "the polarization asymmetry is 100% in magnitude for the production off a gluon target , and the current spectrum of models for @xmath132 leads to a wide diversity of @xmath129 or @xmath128 predictions for pion photoproduction in the fragmentation region .",
