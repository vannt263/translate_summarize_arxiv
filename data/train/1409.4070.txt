    "at sufficiently high intensities , matter no longer reacts linearly to light , and may re - emit at integer multiples ( _ harmonics _ ) of the frequency of the incoming source  @xcite . according to perturbation theory , the intensity of the harmonics decreases exponentially with their order .",
    "however , the spectrum of atoms and molecules exposed to very intense , typically infrared , laser pulses was found to present unexpectedly high harmonics  @xcite , and its shape was observed to have a plateau extending non - perturbatively over many orders of magnitude  a process known as _ high harmonic generation _ ( hhg )  @xcite .",
    "the light emitted in this manner is coherent and may reach the extreme ultraviolet and soft x - ray frequency regime opening the path towards the coherent manipulation and control of matter at its natural time scale .",
    "these properties can be of paramount importance for many technological and scientific purposes in ultrafast science ",
    "most notably , the generation of attosecond pulse trains or single isolated attosecond pulses , or the external seeding of free - electron lasers  @xcite .",
    "these advances allow to follow the electron dynamics  @xcite .",
    "unsurprisingly , a big effort has been devoted to first understanding the underlying physics , and then to controlling and fine - tuning the efficiency and spectral characteristics of the harmonic radiation .",
    "the latter can be done by modifying the non - linear medium , or by post - processing the signal with filters , gratings , etc .",
    "however , one advantageous alternative is to modify the characteristics of the parent pulse , which obviously will modify the spectral outcome . the most obvious manner of doing this is by systematically varying the defining parameters of this parent pulse  @xcite .",
    "however , the current availability of advanced pulse shaping tools  @xcite , together with the development of closed - loop quantum control techniques  @xcite , provides a superior optimization alternative  @xcite . in this manner",
    ", the successful selective enhancement of harmonic orders could be achieved when using a hollow fiber container for the generating medium  @xcite .",
    "gas jet ( _ free focusing _ ) geometries were also employed  @xcite , but although some degree of control could be achieved ( for example , the extension of the cut - off frequency ) , the very selective order enhancement or depletion obtained with the hollow fibers was not observed .",
    "this fact seems to imply that this type of selective enhancement can not be explained from the single - atom response only ; instead , the propagation effects present in the capillary set - up apparently play a fundamental role . in this context .",
    "quasiphase matching ( qpm ) approach is commonly used to achieve independent phase control between multiple high - harmonics  @xcite .",
    "however , a full interpretation of the optimisation mechanisms can only be achieved with theoretical input , for which purpose one may utilise quantum simulations in combination with the theoretical branch of quantum optimal control  @xcite ( qoct ) .",
    "recently , schaefer and kosloff  @xcite have addressed this task , showing the possibility of enhancing the emission at desired frequencies for simple few level systems and one - dimensional one.electron system . here",
    "we address , by first principles simulations based on time - dependent density functional theory , the role of many electron interactions in the high harmonic generation , and provide compelling evidence that a single - atom hhg emission can be enhanced by few orders of magnitude in a controlled manner , with standard laser shaping techniques available in many experimental labs .",
    "the _ three - step _ model successfully describes the key features of hhg  @xcite , at least qualitatively .",
    "it combines a quantum description of the ionisation and recombination of the electrons , with a classical description of the intermediate electronic propagation .",
    "@xcite developed an approximate , mostly analytical , quantum description based on the _ strong field approximation _",
    "( sfa ) : it neglects the contribution of excited bound states , the depletion of the ground state , and considers the continuum electrons to be free of the influence of the parent ion .",
    "a more precise approach consists of propagating schrdinger s equation  @xcite , an expensive method that quickly becomes prohibitive as we increase the number of electrons .",
    "for one - electron problems the approach is perfectly feasible , and this fact has encouraged the use of the _ single active electron _ approximation ( sae ) , which assumes that only one electron is significantly disturbed by the field , and its evolution may be computed on the combination of the laser field and the potential originating by the parent ion .",
    "this single electron picture is commonly used to describe recollision processes and hhg in atoms and relies on the fact that under hhg conditions there is one electron being ionised .",
    "however this does nt imply the other electrons do not play a role .",
    "there is indeed no formal justification for the use of the sae and in fact , many - body effects have been shown recently to play an important role in hhg providing an explanation of why heavier atoms emit stronger hhg than lighter ones  @xcite and the giant enhancement of he hhg at 100  ev  @xcite . however , the sae has been successful in explaining a few features of the hhg spectra such as the spectral cutoff , the phase structure of the spectrum and the prediction of the generation of attosecond pulses .    in spite of all those experimental and theoretical efforts ,",
    "it is clear that the topic of selective hhg generation deserves further microscopical analysis , and in this work , we explore the optimisation possibilities of one and two electron systems ( the hydrogen and the helium atoms ) , isolating the single atom response , so that we can learn how much selectivity in the hhg spectrum can be obtained from isolated atoms that can nicely complement qpm schemes in enhancing further the hhg selective emission . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ a global optimisation scheme that acts on the envelope of the generating pulse , maintaining the fundamental frequency and minimising undesired ionisation ( and for molecules also dissociation ) processes . for the case of helium , we report results obtained both with the single active electron approximation , and with time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft )  @xcite , in order to assess the influence of the electron - electron interaction in the optimisation process . as",
    "many - electron effects may be relevant , tddft appears as the ideal framework to capture them in the hhg spectra ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) as it combines a very good compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency .",
    "the present optimisation scheme has been implemented in the first - principles code octopus  @xcite , that allows the treatment of more complex molecular and extended systems .",
    "however for the purposes of the present work , it is better to stay at the simplest level of one and two electron systems . larger electronic systems would offer a wider range of possibilities for hhg enhancement .",
    "within the dipole approximation and in the length gauge , the experimentally measured harmonic spectrum can be theoretically approximated by the following formula : @xmath0 i.e. the power spectrum of the second derivative of the expectaction value of the dipole moment @xmath1 ( although see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on the pertinence of using , alternatively , the first derivative or the dipole moment itself ) .",
    "this object is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ( static ) ionic potential , @xmath4 is the number of electrons , @xmath5 is the laser pulse electric field , and @xmath6 is the polarization vector ( see the methods appendix below for some extra details about the theory ) .",
    "note that this expression can be read as both the acceleration of the electronic system , and as the corresponding back - reaction of the nucleus ( or nuclear center of mass , if we are dealing with a molecule ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the electromagnetic emission must be related with a charge acceleration .",
    "the expression corresponds , except for the mass factor , with the classical _ force _ acting on the nucleus , considered as a point particle .",
    "we will therefore rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : hhgfunction ] ) as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fourier transform of : @xmath9    from a tddft perspective , the use of this force functional is convenient since it can be explicitly written as a density functional : @xmath10    usually , the electric field @xmath5 is factorised into a sinusoidal function determining the fundamental frequency @xmath11 , and an _ envelope _",
    "function @xmath12 that determines the overall laser - pulse shape : @xmath13 this factorisation  and the concept of a _ fundamental frequency _  is meaningful for long and quasi - monochromatic pulses , but as the technology has reached the optical period limit , it has started to lose its relevance .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a fundamental frequency is implicit when speaking of harmonics , which are defined as radiation at integer multiples of precisely that frequency .",
    "these will only be well defined if the envelope function is _ smooth _ compared to the sinusoidal term , i.e. its frequencies are much lower than @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in this work , we investigate the possibility of manipulating the envelope function @xmath12 , leaving the sinusoidal factor @xmath14 unchanged , in order to influence the shape of the hhg spectrum .",
    "this manipulation can not be unconstrained , as the envelope must be composed of frequencies much lower than @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we have searched for solutions that preserve the fluence or total integrated energy of the pulse : @xmath15    this type of requirement of a specific structure for the solution field ( in terms of frequencies , fluence , etc . )",
    "can be respected following essentially two routes : by imposing penalties on undesired features of the pulses in the definition of the optimising function , or by constraining from the beginning the search space .",
    "this latter option can be achieved by establishing a parametrisation of the control field ( in this case , the envelope ) that enforces the required condition , and is the route that we have chosen for this work .",
    "the search for the optimum is in this manner performed in the space of parameters that determine the control field ; the remaining necessary ingredient is the definition of a _ merit _ function that encodes the physical requirements .",
    "moreover , the assumption of low frequencies for @xmath12 implies that the spectrum of @xmath16 is concentrated around @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17 term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d2dmudt2 ] ) , ( [ eq : ft ] ) , and ( [ eq : d2dmu ] ) does not contribute to the hhg spectrum in the region we are interested in and in the following we will safely ignore it .    we have shown how the hhg spectrum may be explicitly computed solely in terms of the system electronic density @xmath18 . for systems with more than one electron , this fact is convenient since it allows to use time - dependent density - functional theory  @xcite ( tddft ) ( see methods ) .",
    "one can substitute the propagation of the real interacting system by the propagation of a system of fictitious non - interacting electrons whose density is however identical to that of the real one , despite the fact that its wave function is a single slater determinant .",
    "hereafter , we will restrict the discussion to one and two - electron systems , the extension to systems with larger number of electrons is straightforward in the tddft framework .",
    "the one - electron case obviously does not need a tddft treatment , although it may be treated as such by considering one single occupied orbital .",
    "for such one - orbital problem , the exchange and correlation potential must cancel the hartree term : @xmath19(\\vec{r},t ) = - v_{\\rm h}[n](\\vec{r},t)\\,,\\ ] ] so that the resulting equation reduces to the initial schrdinger equation . for two - electron systems ,",
    "we use the exact - exchange approximation ( exx ) to the xc term , which for this two - electron case amounts to setting : @xmath19(\\vec{r},t ) = - \\frac{1}{2}v_{\\rm h}[n](\\vec{r},t)\\,,\\ ] ] note that in this form tddft is identical to time - dependent hartree - fock that provides a food description of the non - linear properties of two - electron systems except for the description of charge - transfer excitations ( see for example ref .",

    "this definition ensures that the substitution of the real by the kohn - sham system in the optimization entails no further approximation .",
    "the theory must however be developed in terms of a functional of the kohn - sham orbitals , which can be easily defined as : @xmath28 = \\tilde{f}[\\mu\\varphi^*\\varphi]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the occupation of the orbital , i.e. one or two for one- or two - electron calculations , respectively .",
    "we must now choose a form for @xmath30 in such a way that its maximization leads to the desired hhg optimization , namely the selective increase of one harmonic peak  that should leave the neighboring ones as low as possible .",

    "however , this choice proved to be problematic , since the modulation of the source signal with the envelope function leads to displacements , sometimes substantial , of the harmonic peaks with respect to the precise integer multiples @xmath32 .",
    "a general definition that solves this problem ( and that includes the previous one as a particular case ) , is : @xmath33 =   \\int\\!\\!{\\rm d}\\omega \\alpha(\\omega)h[\\varphi](\\omega )   = \\int\\!\\!{\\rm d}\\omega \\alpha(\\omega ) \\vert \\vec{f}[\\varphi](\\omega)\\vert^2\\,,\\ ] ] where we have made explicit the fact that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hhgfunction ] ) and ( [ eq : ft ] ) are functionals of the time - dependent evolution for the system .",
    "the function @xmath36 permits to establish some finite window around each harmonic peak @xmath32 , that will be positive for the harmonic orders that we want to enhance , and negative for the ones that we want to reduce .",
    "finally , a third option is to seek for the maximum of the spectrum in these frequency windows around the harmonic orders , i.e. : @xmath37   = \\sum_{k } \\alpha_k \\max_{\\omega \\in [ k\\omega_0 - \\beta , k\\omega_0      + \\beta ] } \\lbrace \\log_{10 } h[\\varphi](\\omega)\\rbrace \\,,\\ ] ] where the real number @xmath38 determines the size of the window .",
    "once the function @xmath25 has been defined ( through the definition of the target functional @xmath30 ) , it remains to use some optimization algorithm to find the optimal @xmath22 set .",
    "there are numerous options , and we may divide them on two groups , depending on whether or not they require the computation of the gradient of @xmath25  in addition of the computation of the function itself .",

    "in fact , for the optimizations attempted in this work , we observed numerically that the target of eq .",

    "( [ eq : hhgtarget1 ] ) .    therefore , it remains to specify the set of parameters @xmath22 that determine the envelope of the electric fields .",
    "the requirements are : ( i ) the envelope should have a given cut - off frequency ; ( ii ) the field should smoothly approach zero at the end points of the propagation time interval ; ( iii ) the total integral of the field should be zero , and ( iv ) the _ fluence _ or total integrated intensity of the pulse should have a constant pre - defined value .",
    "this last condition is merely a choice , and not a physical constraint that experimentalists face .",
    "the first step to parametrize the applied time - dependent electroc field @xmath5 in order to enforce all these constraints is to expand the envelope in a fourier series : @xmath49 where @xmath50 this series fixes the maximum possible ( _ cut - off _ ) frequency to @xmath51 .",

    "we have shown that few orders of magnitude hhg enhancement factor can be reached at the single - atom level .",
    "thus , if this fact is combined with the phase matching method used for hhg generation we would be able to reach much higher global harmonic enhancement in atomic and molecular gases .",
    "moreover , our results illustrate the role of electron - electron interactions in this optimisation and control of hhg .",
    "this can be qualitatively rationalised in terms of the larger hilbert space spanned by the interacting system as compare to the simplest single - active electron scheme ( or any other non - interacting electron approach ) .",

    "the time - dependent density of the system may be retrieved from the ks orbitals with the simple formula : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the occupation of each orbital , which is equal to two if we consider a spin - compensated system of @xmath4 electrons , doubly occupying a set of @xmath80 spatial orbitals @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "the time - dependent external potential for these one - electron equations is given by @xmath88 , in terms of objects already defined .",
    "we have studied the two simplest atoms , hydrogen and helium . for the helium atom ,",
    "we have used tddft with the exact - exchange functional . in order to assess the possible relevance of the electron - electron interaction , we have repeated the helium atom calculations employing the single active electron ( sae ) approximation , which in this case amounts to freezing the hartree , exchange and correlation functional to its ground - state value during the propagations . in this manner",
    ", we are effectively ignoring the electron - electron interaction during the propagation , and may gauge the relevance that it may have on the possibility of changing hhg spectra via smooth variations of the envelope function .",
    "for the purpose of studying the hhg of atoms in linearly polarized pulses , one - dimensional ( 1d ) models have been routinely employed in the past , and we have adhered to this practice , since it provides a good qualitative picture , while substantially reduces the computational cost . the nucleus - electron interaction has the soft - coulomb form : @xmath89 for an electron placed at @xmath90 and a nucleus of charge @xmath91 placed at @xmath92 . the constant @xmath93 may be tuned to reproduce some atomic property ( e.g. ionization potential ) , although in this case we have simply fixed it to one for both hydrogen and helium .",
