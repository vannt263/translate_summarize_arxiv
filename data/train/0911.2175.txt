    "the inclusive radiative decays of the @xmath1 meson play a central role in the search for new physics . while the total rate of @xmath5  is sensitive to new physics in flavor - changing transitions ,",
    "its photon spectrum is almost completely determined by standard model physics and can be employed to extract information on the @xmath1 meson structure and on the @xmath6 quark mass , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the latter are useful in a number of @xmath1 physics applications , like the determination of @xmath7 and of @xmath8 , which are both important inputs for the determination of the ckm unitarity triangle and the study of cp violation in the standard model .    after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom at the electroweak scale and evolving the resulting weak hamiltonian to the @xmath6 quark mass scale ,",
    "inclusive radiative and semileptonic @xmath1 decays are well described by an operator product expansion ( ope ) in inverse powers of the @xmath6 quark mass . in this way one can factorize the long distance dynamics into the matrix elements of a few local operators @xcite . since the wilson coefficients of these operators are perturbative , and the matrix elements of the local operators parameterize the non - perturbative physics , the radiative and semileptonic rates and the moments of their distributions are double series in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the qcd scale .",
    "the lowest order of this expansion corresponds to the decay of a free @xmath6 quark and linear @xmath12 corrections are absent .",
    "the relevant parameters are therefore the heavy quark mass @xmath3 ( and possibly @xmath13 for the charmed decays ) , @xmath9 , and the matrix elements of the local operators : @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 at @xmath19 . in the case of @xmath20 transitions , the first and second central moments of the photon spectrum , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "are proportional to the @xmath6 quark mass and to @xmath14 , respectively , up to subleading corrections in the @xmath23 expansion , and contribute in an important way to the global fits for the extraction of @xmath8 , @xmath3 and the other ope parameters ( see @xcite for recent results ) .",
    "the precision of @xmath5  calculations in this framework is known to be limited in two ways : @xmath24 the dominant contribution to the radiative @xmath6 decay is associated to the electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath25 , with additional operators appearing at @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that a local ope can be written down for the @xmath26 contribution only , while the other operators are expected to induce unknown @xmath27 contributions , see e.g.  @xcite ; @xmath28 even for the dominant @xmath26 component , the experimental cuts employed to isolate the signal introduce a sensitivity to the fermi motion of the @xmath6 quark inside the @xmath1 meson and tend to disrupt the ope .",
    "one can still resum the higher order terms into a non - local distribution function @xcite and since the lowest integer moments of this function are known , one can parameterize it assuming different functional forms @xcite , although alternative approaches are also possible @xcite .",
    "the perturbative corrections to the leading @xmath26 contribution are presently known to complete next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , i.e.  @xmath29 , while the nnlo contributions involving other operators , quite important for the rate , are not yet complete @xcite , see @xcite for recent updates . as for the non - perturbative corrections to the @xmath26 contribution ,",
    "they are known through @xmath19 @xcite . among the non - perturbative corrections associated to operators other than @xmath26 ,",
    "only one class is known : they are of @xmath30 and @xmath31 and numerically small @xcite .",
    "overall , the known power corrections modify the total @xmath5  rate by just @xmath32 , but they are essential in the calculation of the moments .",
    "in this paper we present the first calculation of the @xmath0 corrections to the @xmath33 terms in @xmath5  .",
    "the @xmath0 perturbative corrections to the @xmath14 coefficient in the total rate are fixed by lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "their contribution to the photon moments has been computed in the context of a multiscale ope @xcite which applies however to the end - point region only .",
    "we have computed the relevant wilson coefficients at @xmath0 by expanding off - shell amputated green functions around the @xmath6 quark mass shell , and by matching them onto local operators in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "our results allow for an improved analysis of the radiative moments .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of the @xmath0 perturbative corrections to the variance of the spectrum , permits the extraction of @xmath14 at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recalculate the wilson coefficients of the matrix elements of dimension five operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , at leading order in @xmath34 and introduce our notation .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the calculation of these wilson coefficients at @xmath35 .",
    "it also contains our final results and a first numerical estimate of their importance . in section 4",
    "we summarize and conclude .",
    "at low energy the @xmath36 transition is governed by the effective lagrangian @xmath37 which includes , apart from the qed and qcd interactions of the light quarks @xmath38 and @xmath6 , the renormalization scale dependent effective wilson coefficient @xmath39 and the corresponding electromagnetic operator @xmath26 .",
    "the latter mediates the @xmath36 transition and is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the running @xmath6 quark mass in the @xmath42-scheme , @xmath43/2 $ ] and @xmath44 .",
    "the ellipses in equation ( [ eq::lagrangian ] ) denote contributions from operators that are not relevant for our calculation .    using this effective lagrangian",
    "we can derive that part of the differential decay rate that is induced by the self - interference of the electromagnetic dipole operator , @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the mass of the @xmath1 meson , @xmath47 the momentum of the photon , @xmath48 the hadronic tensor , @xmath49    & \\qquad\\times\\,\\langle\\bar b(p_b)|\\bar b(0)\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}p_ls(0)|x_s(p_x)\\rangle    \\langle x_s(p_x)|\\bar s(0)\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}p_rb(0)|\\bar b(p_b)\\rangle\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath50 the photon tensor , @xmath51    & = q^\\alpha q^\\nu g^{\\mu\\beta}-q^\\alpha q^\\mu g^{\\nu\\beta } +    q^\\mu q^\\beta g^{\\nu\\alpha}-q^\\beta q^\\nu g^{\\mu\\alpha}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hadronic tensor @xmath48 itself can be rewritten as @xmath52 which is useful because the time - ordered product can be expanded into a series of local operators that are suppressed by powers of the @xmath6 quark mass . hence we can write @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an operator of dimension @xmath55 that contains @xmath56 derivatives , and @xmath57 is the corresponding wilson coefficient that can be determined in perturbation theory . in the reminder of this section we will review the calculation of @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
