    "_ entangled states _ have been known almost from the very beginning of quantum mechanics and their somewhat unusual features have been investigated for many years .",
    "however , the recent developments of the theory of quantum information and quantum computing caused a rapid increase of the interest in studying their properties and possible applications . to illustrate this trend",
    "let us quote some data from the los alamos quantum physics archives .",
    "in 1994 only one paper posted in these archives contained the key word entangled ( or entanglement ) in the title , while two such papers were posted in 1995 .",
    "since then the number of such papers has increased dramatically , and was equal to @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in the consecutive years 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , respectively .",
    "we do not dare to fit some fast growing curves to these data nor to speculate , when such an increase will eventually saturate . on the other hand , since so many authors have dealt with entangled states , it is legitimate to ask , whether such states are typical in quantum theory , or if they are rather rare and unusual . vaguely speaking",
    ", we shall be interested in the relative likelihood of encountering an entangled state @xcite .",
    "one may also ask a complementary question concerning the set of the _ separable _ states , which can be represented as a sum of product states .    consider a quantum system described by the density matrix @xmath7 which represents a mixture of the pure states of the @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space . let us assume that the system consists of two subsystems , of dimension @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 . to formulate the basic question _",
    "what is the probability of finding an entangled state of size @xmath1? _ , one needs to :    \\(i ) define the probability measure @xmath11 , according to which the random density matrices @xmath7 are drawn ,    \\(ii ) find an efficient technique , which would allow one to judge , whether a given mixed state @xmath7 is entangled .",
    "representing any density matrix in the diagonal form @xmath12 we proposed @xcite to use a product measure @xmath13 , where @xmath14 describes the uniform measure on the simplex @xmath15 and @xmath16 stands for the haar measure in the space of unitary matrices @xmath17 .",
    "based on the partial transposition criterion @xcite we found that under this measure the volume of the set of separable states is positive and decreases with the system size @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "some more general analytical bounds were also provided by vidal and tarrach @xcite .",
    "recently slater suggested estimating the same quantity using some other measures in the space of the density matrices @xcite .",
    "one may thus expect that the volume of the separable states depends on the measure chosen .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case . in this work",
    "we investigate which statistical properties describing the set of the entangled states may be universal , e.g. do not depend on the measure used . in particular we demonstrate that the relation between the purity of mixed states and the probability of entanglement is not very sensitive to the measure assumed . basing on numerical results",
    "we conjecture that the volume of the separable states decreases exponentially with the system size @xmath1 .    for @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "a density matrix is separable if and only if its partial transpose is positive @xcite . for @xmath20 , however , there exist states , which are not separable and do satisfy this criterion @xcite .",
    "these states can not be distilled to the singlet form and are called _ bound entangled _ @xcite . since there are no explicit conditions allowing one to distinguish between separable and bound entangled states , in ref . @xcite",
    "only the upper bound for the volume of separable states was considered for @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we present an efficient numerical method of computing the _ entanglement of formation _",
    "@xcite for any density matrix .",
    "this method allows us to estimate the volume of bound entangled states , by taking a reasonably small cut - off entanglement @xmath22 and counting these states satisfying the partial transposition criterion for which @xmath23 .",
    "our numerical results are to large extent independent on the exact value of @xmath22 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the necessary definitions and study how the upper bound of the volume of the separable states depends on the system size and the measure used .",
    "the next section is devoted to analysis of the simplest case @xmath18 , for which the bound entangled states do not exist . in this case the analytical formula for the entanglement of formation is known @xcite and we study how this quantity changes with the purity of the mixed states . in section iv we study the case @xmath3 and estimate the volume of the free entangled states , bound entangled states and separable states .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v containing a list of open questions . in appendix",
    "a we prove the rotational invariance of the two distinguished measures @xmath24 and @xmath25 , defined on the @xmath26 dimensional simplex and demonstrate the link with the ensembles of random matrices .",
    "the algorithm of computing the entanglement of formation for a given density matrix is presented in appendix b.",
    "to discuss the probability , that a mixed quantum state possesses a given property , one needs to define a probability measure @xmath27 in the space of density matrices ( @xmath28 positive hermitian matrices with trace equal to unity ) .",
    "each density matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary rotation .",
    "let @xmath29 be a diagonal unitary matrix . since @xmath30 therefore the rotation matrix @xmath31 is determined up to @xmath1 arbitrary phases entering @xmath29 .",
    "the total number of independent variables used to parametrize in this way any density matrix @xmath7 is equal to @xmath32 .",
    "since the literature seemed not to distinguish any natural measure in this space , we approached the problem by defining a product measure @xcite @xmath33 the measure @xmath16 is defined in the space of unitary matrices @xmath17 , while @xmath34 is defined in the @xmath35-dimensional simplex determined by the trace condition @xmath36 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we took for @xmath37 the haar measure on @xmath17 , while the uniform measure @xmath14 was used on the simplex .",
    "our choice was motivated by the fact that the both component measures are rotationally invariant . for @xmath38",
    "this follows directly from the definition of the haar measure , while in appendix a we prove that the uniform measure @xmath39 corresponds to taking for the vector @xmath40 the squared moduli of complex elements of a column or a row ( say , the first column ) of an auxiliary random unitary matrix @xmath41 drawn with respect to @xmath38 @xmath42 in the sequel we will thus refer to the measure defined by ( [ muu ] ) as the unitary product measure @xmath43 .    as correctly pointed out by slater @xcite , our choice of the measure is by far not the only one possible .",
    "he discussed several possible measures , and proposed to pick the measure on the @xmath35d simplex from a certain family of the dirichlet distributions @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a free parameter and @xmath46 stands for a normalization constant .",
    "the last component is determined by the trace condition @xmath47 .",
    "the uniform measure @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "slater distinguishes also the case @xmath49 , which is related to the fisher information metric @xcite , the mahalonobis distance @xcite and jeffreys prior @xcite , and was used for many years in different contexts @xcite .",
    "since this measure is induced by squared elements of a column ( a row ) of a random _ orthogonal _ matrix ( see appendix a ) , we shall refer to @xmath50 as to the orthogonal product measure in the space of the mixed quantum states .",
    "therefore both measures may be directly linked to the well known gaussian unitary ( orthogonal ) ensembles of random matrices @xcite , referred to as gue and goe .",
    "the measure @xmath51 is determined by squared components of an eigenvector of a gue matrix , while the measure @xmath52 may defined by components of an eigenvector of goe matrices @xcite .",
    "some properties of the orthogonal measure @xmath52 have been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "let us stress that the name of the product measure ( orthogonal or unitary ) is related to the distribution @xmath53 on the simplex @xmath54 , while the random rotations @xmath31 are always assumed to be distributed according to the haar measure @xmath55 in @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to consider the limiting cases of the distribution ( [ dirichlet ] ) . for @xmath56",
    "one obtains a singular distribution concentrated on the pure states only @xcite , while in the opposite limit @xmath57 , the distribution is peaked on the maximally mixed state @xmath58 described by the vector @xmath59 . changing the continuous parameter @xmath60",
    "one can thus control the average purity of the generated mixed states .",
    "consider a composite quantum system described by the density matrix @xmath61 in the @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space @xmath62 .",
    "dimension of the system @xmath1 is equal to the product @xmath63 of the dimensions of the both subsystems .",
    "if the state @xmath64 can be expressed as @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , it is called _ product _ state ( or factorizable state ) .",
    "this occurs if and only if @xmath68 , where tr@xmath69 and tr@xmath70 denote the operations of partial tracing . in other words , for such states the description of the composite state is equivalent to the description in the both subsystems .",
    "a given quantum state @xmath7 is called _ separable _ , if it can be represented by a sum of product states @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the states on @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the smallest number @xmath76 of the product states used in the above decomposition is called the _",
    "cardinality _ of the separable state @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in general no explicit necessary and sufficient conditions are known for a mixed state to be separable .",
    "however , peres found a necessary condition showing that each separable state has the positive partial transpose @xcite .",
    "later horodeccy demonstrated that for @xmath18 and @xmath19 this is also a sufficient condition @xcite . to represent any state @xmath7 it is convenient to use an arbitrary orthonormal product basis @xmath77 , @xmath78 @xmath79 and to define the matrix @xmath80 .",
    "the operation of _ partial transposition _ is then defined @xcite @xmath81 even though the matrix @xmath82 depends on the particular based used , its eigenvalues @xmath83 do not .",
    "the matrix @xmath82 is positive iff all eigenvalues @xmath84 are not negative .",
    "the practical application of the partial transpose criterion is thus straightforward : for a given state @xmath7 one computes @xmath85 , diagonalizes it , and checks the signs of all eigenvalues . to characterize quantitatively the violation of positivity we introduced @xcite the negativity @xmath86 which is equal to zero for all the states with positive partial transpose .      in @xcite",
    "we presented several analytical lower and upper bounds for the volume of separable states .",
    "they were obtained assuming the unitary product measure , but the same reasoning can be repeated for other measures . the key result : an analytical proof that the volume of separable states is positive and less than one , is obviously valid for any nonsingular measure .    to analyze the influence of the measure chosen for the volume of the separable states @xmath87 we picked several random density matrices (",
    "circa @xmath88 ) distributed according to the orthogonal and unitary product measures , and verified , whether their partial transpose ( [ transpose ] ) are positive .",
    "the results are displayed in fig.1 as a function of the system size @xmath1 .",
    "note that for @xmath20 we obtained in this way the volume @xmath89 of the states with positive partial transposition , which gives an upper bound for the volume of separable states .",
    "in fact @xmath90 , where the volume @xmath91 of the entangled states with positive partial transpose is studied in the section iv .",
    "the symbols are labeled by the size of the first subsystem @xmath8 . for both measures",
    "the symbols seem to lay on one curve , which would imply that @xmath92 . however , this relation is only approximate , since @xmath93 as pointed out by smolin @xcite .",
    "numerical results for @xmath89 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 are collected in table 1 .",
    "the difference between @xmath96 and @xmath97 is not large , and was smaller than the statistical error of the results reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to neglect for a while these subtle effects , depending on the way the @xmath1 dimensional system is composed , and to ask , how , in a first approximation , @xmath89 changes with @xmath1 .",

    "this is the main result of this section : the different results obtained for the probability @xmath122 using various product measures @xmath123 are due to the different weights attributed to the mixed states . since the average mixture @xmath124 grows monotonically with the parameter @xmath60 ( from @xmath125 for @xmath126 to @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) also the probability @xmath122 increases with this parameter from zero to unity .",
