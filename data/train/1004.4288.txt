    "the elimination of degrees of freedom of a symmetric mechanical system , the basic goal of reduction theory , is an old subject that dates back to the mid - nineteen century .",
    "the work of routh in the context of abelian symmetries of classical mechanical systems was extended by many others in an effort to explore different aspects of the reduction process .",
    "currently , there are well developed theories of reduction in the hamiltonian setting , where the emphasis is in the reduction of the symplectic and poisson structures , and the lagrangian setting , mostly focused on the reduction of variational principles .",
    "the literature in this area is vast ; modern references are , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "discrete time mechanical systems have been considered in the literature since the 1960s , mostly as a way to approximate and model the behavior of ( continuous ) mechanical systems ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the dynamics of nonholonomic discrete mechanical systems has been introduced by j. corts and s. martinez in  @xcite .",
    "many characteristics of mechanical systems have a discrete analogue .",
    "one important feature whose discrete analogue has been exposed only partially in the literature is the reduction of symmetries .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to describe a reduction and reconstruction process for discrete time mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints , in the lagrangian setting .",
    "there are many reasons for being interested in the reduction of a symmetric system , be it continuous or discrete . on the one hand , the reduced system has less degrees of freedom , which may be an advantage when trying to solve the equations of motion . on the other , in many cases , the reduced system encodes the core dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "a good example of the advantage of working on the reduced system in the discrete case is presented by s. jalnapurkar et al . in  @xcite where they show how the reduced system is free from geometric phases effects allowing them to observe interesting dynamical structures , which were hard to separate in the unreduced system .",
    "there are already several results on the reduction and reconstruction of symmetric nonholonomic discrete mechanical systems available in the literature .",
    "the case where the configuration space of the system @xmath3 is a lie group has been studied by y. fedorov and d. zenkov in  @xcite and by r. mclachlan and m. perlmutter in  @xcite .",
    "they obtain reduced equations of motion on the lie algebra of the lie group of symmetries which coincide , in the unconstrained case , with those obtained by a. bobenko and y. suris in  @xcite .",
    "the case of chaplygin systems , that is , when the symmetry group acts in such a way that no symmetry direction is compatible with the given constraints is analyzed by j. corts in  @xcite and , in context of groupoids , by d. iglesias et al . in  @xcite . also , the unconstrained case has been treated by s. jalnapurkar et al . in  @xcite and , using discrete connections , by m. leok et al . in  @xcite . a different approach using groupoids",
    "is given in  @xcite ; in this case , the abstract reduction theory of groupoids produces a general reduced system on a groupoid ; our approach differs from theirs , ours being more elementary we stay in the `` pair groupoid '' case and , at the same time , more explicit because we incorporate additional information ( connections ) to our models .",
    "the reduction results that we present here are modeled on the results of h. cendra et al . in  @xcite for continuous systems .",
    "they consider the action of a lie group @xmath4 on a configuration manifold @xmath3 so that the quotient map @xmath5 is a principal bundle and the other data is @xmath4-invariant .",
    "they relate the variational principle that determines the dynamics of the original system with a reduced variational principle , that determines the dynamics of the reduced system .",
    "eventually , equations of motion are derived from both variational principles .",
    "the introduction of a connection on the principal bundle @xmath6 serves them to , first , construct an isomorphic model for the natural reduced space @xmath7 and , also , to split the reduced variational principle and equations of motion into horizontal and vertical parts .",
    "appropriate choice of a connection can lead to a simplified analysis of a specific mechanical system .    at a philosophical level , a common approach to discrete mechanics",
    "consists of replacing the tangent bundle @xmath8 by @xmath9 , with the idea that infinitesimal displacement velocities are replaced by finite displacement pairs of points . even though this is a powerful idea , there are some very important differences between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , that make it difficult to transfer techniques developed for continuous systems to discrete systems , as we will see later .",
    "the construction of the reduced space in  @xcite relies on an isomorphism defined using a connection on the principal bundle @xmath10 , which is seen as a @xmath4-invariant splitting of @xmath8 , that descends to a splitting of @xmath7 . in the discrete case , we follow the same path , but using what we call an affine discrete connection , a minor generalization of the discrete connections introduced by m. leok et al . in  @xcite which allows us to split @xmath11 .",
    "using , in addition , a connection , we are able to derive a reduced variational principle as well as reduced equations of motion that split in horizontal and vertical parts .    the vertical part of the variational principle and equations turn out to be equivalent to what is known as the discrete nonholonomic momentum evolution equation  @xcite that determines how the discrete nonholonomic momentum mapping , defined in terms of the symmetry directions that are compatible with the constraints , evolves for discrete mechanical system .",
    "the so called horizontal symmetries have the property of preserving the discrete nonholonomic momentum .",
    "we specialize the general reduction process in two different settings : the chaplygin and horizontal systems , where we can go further to obtain reduced systems that can be described easily .",
    "the first case is already present in the literature and we derive the known results from our approach .",
    "the other hasnt been considered before in the discrete setting to our knowledge ; horizontal systems have been considered in the continuous setting by corts in  @xcite .",
    "our approach can also be used in the case where the configuration space is a lie group to re derive the results of  @xcite mentioned above .",
    "constraints in a mechanical system on a configuration space @xmath3 are usually given by two distributions : @xmath12 that describes the allowed variations and @xmath13 that limits the allowed trajectories .",
    "the dalembert principle used to determine the dynamics of such systems requires that @xmath14 .",
    "more general situations , called generalized nonholonomic systems , where no connection is made between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "discrete mechanical systems as introduced in  @xcite should be called generalized in the same sense as above , since the setup for constrained discrete mechanical systems consists of @xmath12 , with the same meaning as in the continuous case , and a submanifold @xmath15 which restricts the allowable discrete trajectories , and no relation between the two is assumed .",
    "0.3 cm    the layout of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : reduction_of_continuous_systems ] , we sketch very roughly the lagrangian reduction of classical mechanical systems , which serves the dual purpose of introducing the results in the continuous case as well as the variational approach that serves as motivation for our work in the discrete case .",
    "section  [ sec : discrete_mechanical_systems_and_symmetries ] introduces discrete mechanical systems and their symmetries . in section  [ sec : discrete_tools ] we introduce some tools , including the affine discrete connections , that will be useful in the analysis of the reduction process to be carried out in section  [ sec : variations_and_reduced_variations ] and condensed as theorem  [ th:4_points - general ] .",
    "the statement of this result is written in terms that are not obviously defined on the reduced system ; the purpose of section  [ sec : intrinsic_version_of_the_reduced_equations_of_motion ] is to give an intrinsic version of that result , which we achieve with corollary  [ cor:4_points_general - intrinsic ] .",
    "the reconstruction of the original dynamics starting from that of the reduced system is explored in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : nonholonomic_discrete_momentum ] we study the discrete nonholonomic momentum mapping , showing that the vertical part of the reduced variational principle is equivalent to the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation .",
    "the rest of the paper deals with the specialization of the general theory developed so far to particular situations . in section  [ sec : reduced_equations_of_motion_for_trivial_bundles ] we obtain the equations of motion for systems where @xmath16 is a trivial principal bundle . in sections  [ sec : reduced_equations_of_motion - chaplygin ] and  [ sec : reduced_equations_of_motion - horizontal ] we study systems with chaplygin and horizontal symmetries respectively ; in the chaplygin case we obtain intrinsic versions that specialize to the results of  @xcite , while in the horizontal case we find the discrete version of a type of symmetry whose continuous counterpart had been studied in  @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm last , we wish to thank hernn cendra for his interest and valuable comments on this work .",
