    "the same is generally true for simulations with cooling and feedback .",

    "therefore , in total we have compiled a sample of 21 sets of mass profiles from 19 different clusters ( i.e. , the samples have two clusters in common ) .    both v06 and pap computed the gas and total mass profiles of their clusters in a similar manner , by fitting parametric forms of the gas density and ( 3d ) temperature profiles of the icm ( see eqns .  3 and 6 of v06 and appendix a of pratt et al .",

    "however , there is considerable scatter in the gas fraction at fixed overdensity that is worth exploring .",
    "first , it is evident that the gas mass fractions measured by pap are systematically larger than those measured by v06 .",
    "given that the gas density profiles from the two samples are quite similar ( see mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) , the implication is that the temperature profiles measured by pap and v06 differ systematically from each other .",
    "indeed , v06 generally find temperature profiles that decline relatively rapidly with radius , dropping by roughly a factor of 2 from the peak ( at @xmath16 ) to @xmath17 ( see also vikhlinin et al .",
    "2005 ) , while pap find a much more gradual decline , with some clusters showing approximate isothermality . through the equation of hse",
    ", a flatter temperature gradient translates into a reduced normalisation of the total mass profile and hence an increased gas mass fraction . while it would be useful to sort out the exact nature of the temperature discrepancy , we point out that the typical level of difference between the two is relatively small ( compared to the offset of both from the _ wmap _ result , see  3 ) .",
    "the one exception to this appears to be a1413 , which was observed by both v06 and pap . within @xmath5 ,",
    "v06 find a total mass that is roughly 50% larger than that found by pap . increasing the total mass of a1413 by this factor",
    "would bring it more in line with the other systems studied by pap .",

    "1 also shows that the gas fraction depends on system temperature , which presumably reflects total system mass .",
    "in particular , systems with mean temperatures below 4.5 kev ( red lines ) have systematically lower values for @xmath1 within virtually all overdensities compared with hotter systems ( black lines ) . this trend has been noticed previously ( e.g. , mohr et al .  1999 ;",
    "roussel et al .  2000 ; neumann & arnaud 2001 ) and would seem to indicate that non - gravitational heat sources are relatively more important in mediating the properties of the icm in low mass than in high mass clusters . in figure 2 , we plot the gas mass fraction within an overdensity of 1500 ( typically corresponding to a physical radius of @xmath18 kpc ) versus mean system temperature . we have chosen this radius so that all the clusters in the sample ( including the coolest systems ) have reliable data . note that if non - gravitational heating is unimportant at @xmath19 it will be even less significant at @xmath5 .",
    "a trend with temperature is clearly visible at low temperatures .",
    "however , above @xmath20 kev both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data show no evidence for a further increase , and the gas fraction appears to have converged , suggesting that non - gravitational physics is largely unimportant for the most massive systems ( at least out at large radii ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with previous results based on _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data ( roussel et al . 2000 ; lin et al .",
    "2003 ) , as well as newer _ xmm - newton _ data ( sadat et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is also consistent with the findings of mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , that above @xmath21 kev the gas density and entropy profiles of `` cool core '' systems follow the scaling expected for self - similar gravitational heating at large radius .",
    "we have elected to focus on the data of v06 and pap since their measurements extend out to @xmath13 . as noted earlier",
    ", cosmological simulations can now reliably predict the baryon fraction within this radius .",
    "however , measuring the properties of the icm at such large radii is not easy .",
    "the rapidly declining surface brightnesses of the clusters at large radii means that an extremely careful treatment of the background is crucial .",
    "for this reason , a number of groups have limited their analyses to smaller radii ( higher surface brightnesses ) in an attempt to mitigate any potential systematic effects associated with the background modelling .",
    "while we are encouraged by the similarity of the results of v06 and pap at large radii ( note also that _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have different background characteristics ) , it is useful to check these results against other ( mainly small - radii ) data from the recent literature .    with the above in mind , we include some other recent x - ray gas mass fraction determinations ( within various fixed overdensities ) of hot clusters from the literature ( data points ) in figure 1 . in particular :",

    "the one exception is the data of ettori et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which are systematically lower than the others .",
    "since this is the data ettori ( 2003 ) used to show there was only a very small discrepancy between cluster baryon fractions and the first - year _ wmap _ results , we discuss the studies of ettori et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and ettori ( 2003 ) in a bit more detail in  3 .",
    "x - ray observations are not the only way one can constrain the gas mass fractions of clusters .",
    "increasingly , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect is also being used for this purpose .",
    "for example , laroque et al .  ( 2006 ) found very similar results for @xmath29 when fitting to both _",
    "chandra _ x - ray data and _ bima / ovro _ sz effect data simultaneously ( yellow pentagon in fig .  1 ) or when fitting to the sz effect data alone . more recently , afshordi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have stacked the sz effect signals of 193 clusters in the _ wmap _ 3-year data to constrain the thermal energy of the icm . with the aid of hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", they converted this thermal energy into an estimate of the gas fraction of clusters within @xmath30 .",
    "their result , represented by the open ( cyan ) square in fig .",
    "1 , is in excellent accordance with the x - ray - derived results .",
    "this is very encouraging since the systematics involved in the derivation of this result are obviously very different from those associated with x - ray measurements .",
    "in cosmological simulations the baryon fraction within @xmath5 has converged to @xmath31% of the universal value in the case of non - radiative simulations ( e.g. , frenk et al .  1999 ; kay et al .",
    "2004 ; crain et al .",
    "2006 ) and slightly higher than this when radiative cooling and star formation is included ( e.g. , kravtsov et al .  2005 ; ettori et al .",
    "it is only possible to drive a substantial fraction of the baryons beyond @xmath5 if the energy input from non - gravitational heating ( such as agn powered jets and bubbles ; e.g. , churazov et al .",
    "2002 ) is comparable to the binding energy of the cluster gas ( we quantify the energy requirement in  3.2 ) . in the absence of such high levels",
    "non - gravitational heating , the baryon fractions derived at @xmath5 should be nearly representative of the universal value",
    ".    independent measurements of the universal baryon fraction @xmath0 can be derived from the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies . in figs .  1 and 2 we show the value of @xmath0 constrained by the _",
    "3-year data ( spergel et al .  2007 ) . from fig .  1 it is immediately apparent that , with the exception of pap s estimate of @xmath1 for a1413 , the observational gas mass estimates do not achieve consistency with the _ wmap _ measurements of the baryon fraction within any ( observable ) overdensity .",
    "this is true despite the fact that the _ xmm - newton _ data of pap extend out to nearly @xmath5 ( note that , typically , @xmath32 mpc ) and slightly beyond for the _ chandra _ data of v06 . at the lowest observable overdensity ( largest radii ) ,",
    "the data indicate a gas mass fraction that is roughly 40% lower than @xmath0 inferred from _ wmap _ 3-year data .",
    "2 demonstrates that the observed gas mass fractions at @xmath33 have converged for systems above @xmath34 kev , and still lie well below the _ wmap _ 3-year constraints .",
    "we now examine the possible origins of this sizeable discrepancy . for ease of discussion , we break up the possible solutions into three broad categories .",
    "x - ray data by itself constrains only the fraction of a cluster s mass in the form of hot ( @xmath35 k ) gas . a proper comparison to the universal _ wmap _ baryon fraction therefore requires that we take into account the fraction of cluster s baryons locked up in cool gas ( that does nt emit x - rays ) , stars and baryonic dark matter .",
    "if clusters manage to significantly cool @xmath36 of their baryons this would potentially resolve the discrepancy described above .",
    "indeed , cosmological simulations that take into account the effects of radiative cooling and star formation demonstrate that clusters can potentially cool out such large quantities of their baryons ( e.g. , dav et al .",
    "2002 ; kravtsov et al .",
    "but such simulations are at odds with near - infrared ( k - band ) observations of clusters , which typically indicate that the total ( resolved ) stellar mass is at most 5 - 14% of the icm gas mass in hot ( @xmath37 kev ) clusters and only slightly higher than this in cooler systems ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "2001 ; lin et al .",
    "recent deep optical observations limit the contribution of diffuse intracluster light to between @xmath38 of the total stellar luminosity ( e.g. , gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 ; zibetti et al .",
    "low mass stars and brown dwarfs ( or `` rocks '' ) are also likely to be a significant , undetected component of the mass budget , but there is no strong evidence that they are more abundant than expected from standard initial mass functions used to extrapolate the observed stellar mass functions ( fuchs , jahreiss & flynn 1998 ; gizis et al .  2000 ; lucas et al .",
    "2005 ; levine et al .",
    "radio , infrared , and ultraviolet surveys for atomic , molecular , and ionised gas ( respectively ) limit the contribution of cool ( @xmath39 k ) diffuse baryons to less than a percent or so of the hot x - ray - emitting icm ( e.g. , odea et al .",
    "1998 ; donahue et al .",
    "2000 ; edge 2001 ; edge & frayer 2003 ; bregman et al.2006 ) .",
    "finally , ettori ( 2003 ) have suggested that a significant fraction of cluster baryons could lie at temperatures between @xmath40 k and they cite possible evidence for this in the form the observed `` soft x - ray excess '' .",
    "however , it now appears that this excess was the result of inadequate modelling of the galactic foreground ( bregman & lloyd - davies 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear physically how such large quantities of gas in this temperature range could resist cooling down to @xmath41 k or being mixed or heated to the ambient icm temperature .",
    "furthermore , one can place limits on any hidden cold baryonic component by considering its gravitational effects on the properties of the icm . in particular ,",
    "if the hidden material is centrally concentrated , as one would expect if its origin is linked to cooling , this will deepen the potential well which , in turn , will heat the icm through simple gravitational compression .",
    "the observed temperature profiles can therefore be used to place constraints on the amount of hidden cold material in clusters .",
    "we have tested this as follows .",
    "in particular , we assume the dark matter follows a nfw distribution with a typical concentration parameter @xmath42 .",
    "we further assume the gas density profile follows a distribution typical of observed `` cool core '' clusters ( see v06 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "finally , we try different hidden cold mass distributions .",
    "the predicted icm temperature distributions are computed by placing the gas in hse . in the case where there is no hidden component , we find the resulting temperature profiles quantitatively match the observed ones .",
    "this is not unexpected , given the results of mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( see  3.1 of that study ) .",
    "however , the predicted temperature profiles are quite sensitive to the addition of a centrally - concentrated cold component .",
    "in particular , if we require that the predicted temperature profiles are within the observational uncertainties ( typically , binned temperature profiles have a 10% measurement uncertainty ) , we can rule out a cold component weighing @xmath43 within the central 50 kpc or @xmath44 within the central 100 kpc .",
    "( note that our results at a fixed radius are not sensitive to the distribution of the cold component , only to the total enclosed mass within that radius . )",
    "this is small compared to the @xmath45 required to resolve the cluster vs. cmb discrepancy for a massive @xmath46 cluster . the only way to reconcile the cluster vs. cmb discrepancy and",
    "maintain consistency with the observed temperature profiles is if the hidden component is very spatially - extended .",
    "however , such a configuration seems physically contrived .",
    "it therefore appears that the stellar / cool baryon contribution to the total cluster baryon budget too small to account for the cluster vs. cmb discrepancy . in particular , the resolved stellar / cold baryon component is a approximately factor of 3 smaller than required .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated that any hidden component can not be very massive , otherwise this would violate the observed temperature profiles of relaxed clusters .      as discussed above , the small fraction of cooled baryons observed , relative to the predictions of cooling - only simulations , implies that some form of non - gravitational heating ( `` feedback '' ) is at work in the icm . without significant feedback to prevent this overcooling , theoretical models are unable to account for the observed cut - off of the galaxy luminosity function at the bright end or the fact that bcgs are , by and large , `` red and dead '' ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2003 ; bower et al .  2006 ) , nor would it be possible to explain the lack of x - ray emission from intracluster gas with temperatures below about 1 kev ( e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "non - gravitational heating also appears to be necessary to account for the x - ray scaling properties of clusters ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; babul et al .",
    "2002 ; voit et al .",
    "2002 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "injecting thermal energy into the icm will cause it to expand ( while leaving the dark matter in - tact ) and therefore will reduce the gas mass fraction within a given radius .",
    "can this heating explain the discrepancy between cluster and cmb measurements ?    to test this ,",
    "we have computed the bulk energy required to transform clusters with the universal baryon fraction ( all in hot gas ) into the observed systems . for our _ baseline model clusters _ , we assume the gas traces the total matter at all radii and , therefore , within any radius the integrated gas mass fraction is always the best - fit _ wmap _ 3-year value @xmath47 . the total mass profiles ( which are dominated by dark matter ) are assumed to be the same as those measured by v06 and pap , thus we construct a baseline model cluster for each of the observed systems .",
    "the temperature profiles are determined by placing the gas in hse .",
    "calculating the total energy of the gas in these systems ( i.e. , the summation of the total internal and potential energies ) is then straightforward .",
    "for the _ observed _ systems , we extrapolate the gas and total density profiles beyond the maximum radius to which they can be observed , until the integrated gas mass fraction is the universal ratio .",
    "( note that we also extrapolate the baseline models to this radius to ensure that both the baseline and observed systems have the same integrated gas and total masses . ) .",
    "we assume the total density profiles continue to follow the nfw form fit by v06 and pap .",
    "we try various different powerlaw extrapolations for the gas density profiles with plausible indices ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "we find that the minimum energy required to convert the baseline models into the observed systems occurs when the gas density is constant with radius outside the maximum observable radius .",
    "this configuration is perhaps unlikely , but it does provide a useful _ lower limit _ to the amount of heating required . like the baseline models , we place the gas in the observed systems in hse .",
    "reassuringly , we verify that the resulting temperature profiles are in good agreement with the observed profiles . the total ( minimum ) energy required to heat",
    "the icm is just the difference of the total energy of the observed and baseline model systems .    for hot ( @xmath50 kev ) clusters , we find that a substantial amount of energy is required , ranging between @xmath51 ergs with a mean of @xmath52 ergs ( assuming @xmath53 is constant outside the maximum observable radius - i.e. , the minimum required energy ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this minimum energy estimate with the energy that can potentially be deposited by agn , the most powerful source of non - gravitational heating we know of in clusters of galaxies .",
    "( we note that the energy available from agn far exceeds that available from stellar feedback . )",
    "we estimate the amount of agn energy available to be tapped as follows .",
    "first , we convert lin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) s observed relationship between stellar mass fraction and total mass within @xmath5 ( see equation 10 of that study ) into a stellar  total mass relation [ i.e. , @xmath54 assuming a gas mass fraction of 0.12 within @xmath5 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this relation can be converted into a relationship between the total mass in black holes within @xmath5 by ( optimistically ) assuming that the entire stellar mass is contained in bulges and adopting the black hole ",
    "bulge mass ( @xmath55 ) relation of hring & rix ( 2004 ) .",
    "this leads to the following @xmath56 relation : @xmath57 = 1.12 \\log_{10 } \\biggl[\\frac{f_{\\rm gas}(r_{500})}{0.12 } \\biggr ] \\\\ \\ \\ \\   + \\ \\ 0.84 \\log_{10 } \\biggl[\\frac{m_{500}}{5\\times10^{14 }   m_\\odot }   \\biggr ] + 10.229 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    , defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the efficiency factor .",
    "the thick dashed line shows the amount of energy deposited into the icm by the agn in hercules a , which is the most energetic agn outburst known ( nulsen et al .",
    "the thin dashed line corresponds to the case where a given cluster experiences 10 such hercules - like outbursts over its lifetime .",
    ", width=317 ]    finally , this is converted into an estimate of amount of agn energy available via @xmath60 .    in figure 3 , we present a comparison of the minimum _ specific _ energy required to resolve the cluster vs. cmb discrepancy with the energy available to be tapped in black holes .",
    "( to facilitate comparison with the observations , we calculate the specific energy by dividing the total required energy by the typical _ observed _ mass of gas within r500 . in particular , we assume @xmath61 ; see fig .  1 . ) . in order to explain the most massive systems",
    ", we calculate that a minimum energy of @xmath62 kev per particle is required .",
    "if one adopts an efficiency of @xmath63 , which is approximately the efficiency predicted by standard radiatively efficient accretion disk models ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , there is potentially just enough energy available in black holes distributed throughout @xmath5 to account for the observed gas mass fractions .",
    "( we use the term ` potentially ' since we remind the reader that we have calculated the _ minimum _ energy required and furthermore have made optimistic assumptions about the mass of black holes available to heat the icm . )",
    "this result agrees quite well with the more detailed calculations of bode et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( that include , e.g. , the effects of asphericity and substructure ) , when one normalises their estimated required total energy to the same total mass of gas assumed above .",
    "however , modelling of agn - blown x - ray cavities suggests the typical cluster black hole efficiency is actually much lower than @xmath64 .",
    "the most energetic agn outbursts known , in hercules a ( nulsen et al .  2005 ) and ms0735.6 + 7421 ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ) , have mean powers of @xmath65 ergs s@xmath66 . the typical age of such outbursts is @xmath67 100 myr , corresponding to a total energy of few times @xmath68 ergs or a specific energy of a few tenths of a kev per particle ( see the thick dashed line in fig .  3 ) .",
    "this falls nearly two orders of magnitude short of the required minimum to reduce a massive cluster s baryon fraction from the universal _ wmap _ value to the observed fraction .",
    "therefore , even if a typical cluster experiences 10 such powerful outbursts over its lifetime ( say , once per gyr over 10 gyr ) the energy injected into the icm still falls short of the minimum required energy by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "we therefore conclude that agn heating is a highly implausible , but perhaps not impossible , solution to the cluster vs. cmb discrepancy .",
    "in addition to the exceptionally large energy requirements , we point out that the heating must be distributed in just such a way as to explain the convergence trend in fig .  2 and the fact that the icm properties at large radii in massive clusters follow the _ gravitational _ self - similar scalings ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the observed gas fractions are proportional to @xmath70 , while the _ wmap _ constraint is independent of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , adopting a lower value of @xmath71 would bring these two results into agreement .",
    "indeed , this is why similar analyses by roussel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sadat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who adopt @xmath72 , find higher gas fractions than we have shown here .",
    "however , the large body of independent evidence in favour of @xmath73 ( e.g. york et al . 2005 ; jones et al . 2005 ; riess et al .",
    "2005 ; ngeow & kanbur 2006 ) makes this solution seem unlikely .",
    "we can use the observed baryon content of clusters to reverse - engineer the universal total matter density , @xmath6 , via :    @xmath74}\\ ] ]    where @xmath75 is the baryon depletion factor within @xmath5 and @xmath76 is the observational bias introduced by assuming strict hse ( i.e. , ignores pressure support due to turbulent motions ) , both of which can be estimated using gasdynamic cosmological simulations .    adopting the _ wmap _ baryon density of @xmath77 ( which is in good agreement with the latest qso constraints ; see omeara et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath78 ( kravtsov et al . 2005 ; ettori et al .  2006",
    "; crain et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath79 ( nagai et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath80 ( see  3.1 ) , and @xmath81 ( see fig .  1 - note that this spans both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ results at @xmath5 ) , we find :    @xmath82    this is larger than the best - fit _ wmap _ 3-year value of @xmath83 , but is in good agreement with several previous x - ray analyses ( e.g. , allen et al .  2002 ; lin et al .  2003 ; hicks et al .  2006 ) .    however , our findings differ somewhat from those of ettori ( 2003 ) .",
    "he found evidence for only a marginal discrepancy between his cluster baryon fraction estimates ( inferred from _",
    "x - ray data ) and the first - year _ wmap _ results ( spergel et al .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since ettori ( 2003 ) used the data of ettori et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who actually find _ lower _ gas mass fractions than we have assumed above .",
    "a likely explanation for this discrepancy is that : ( 1 ) he assumed a slightly higher stellar mass fraction ; ( 2 ) he invoked a large fraction of the cluster baryons being hidden at `` warm '' temperatures of @xmath84 k ; and ( 3 ) he extrapolated his results well beyond the maximum observable radius ( @xmath85 ) to the virial radius assuming a king total mass profile for several of his systems .",
    "the first two are inconsistent with recent , more reliable data ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "finally , extrapolation of the data out to the virial radius is highly uncertain .",
    "since simulations and observations now reliably extend out to @xmath5 , such large extrapolations are no longer required .",
    "in addition to the agreement with several previous x - ray studies , our results on @xmath6 also agree with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) measurements of the lyman alpha forest power spectrum ( viel & haehnelt 2005 ) , the baryon acoustic peak of luminous red galaxies ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the power spectrum of galaxies ( tegmark et al .",
    "we also note that combining _ wmap _",
    "3-year joint constraints on @xmath86 and @xmath9 ( which are degenerate , see below ) with weak lensing cosmic shear measurements ( hoekstra et al .",
    "2006 ) results in an increased best - fit value for @xmath6 that is in good agreement with our results ( see fig .  7 or spergel et al .",
    "finally , li et al .  (",
    "2006 ) have also recently reported that the `` low '' value of @xmath6 reported by spergel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is in discord with the number of observed strong lensing giant arcs , however a fiducial flat model with @xmath87 and @xmath88 is able to match the lensing data .    on the other hand ,",
    "several other cosmological tests tend to support the `` low '' value of @xmath6 advocated by spergel et al .",
    "these include measurements of the motions within the local supercluster ( mohayaee & tully 2005 ) , the power spectrum of galaxies in the 2dfgrs ( cole et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the mass function of galaxy clusters in the hiflugcs x - ray flux - limited sample ( reiprich 2006 ) .",
    "clearly , the relatively large scatter in the reported best fit values of @xmath6 warrants further detailed investigation .",
    "while our own estimate of @xmath7 is marginally inconsistent with the _ wmap _ 3-year constraints ( and some of the other tests that support the _ wmap _ result ) , we have argued that this discrepancy is a small price to pay for obtaining agreement with the observed cluster gas mass fractions .",
    "finally , we point out that the discussion carries implications beyond the precise value of @xmath6 . since @xmath6 and @xmath9",
    "are strongly degenerate in the cmb data , our results suggest that @xmath9 is larger than the best - fit value of @xmath89 derived from _",
    "wmap _ data alone .",
    "it is interesting to note that a model with @xmath90 and @xmath91 is within @xmath92sigma of both the cluster gas mass fraction data and the _ wmap _ joint constraints on these parameters .",
    "recent , good quality observations of massive clusters with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ put strong observational constraints on the gas mass fraction in massive clusters at large radius . in many cases",
    "the new data allow the fraction to be constrained out to @xmath5 ( the radius at which the cluster density contrast is 500 ) .",
    "simulations of clusters suggest that the cluster gas fraction at this radius should closely reflect the average baryon mass fraction in the universe as a whole .",
    "we find @xmath93 , where the uncertainty reflects the systematic variations between clusters .",
    "this is lower than the best fit to the _ wmap _ 3-year result of @xmath94 .",
    "we consider whether the discrepancy could be due to a large fraction of the cluster gas cooling to form stars and cold gas clouds , or whether it could be due to strong non - gravitational heating transporting @xmath95% of the cluster gas outside @xmath5 .",
    "observational limits on the stellar and cold gas content of clusters appear to rule out the first possibility . in order to investigate the second",
    ", we compute the energy budget required to rearrange the cluster gas .",
    "the energy required significantly exceeds the plausible energy input from black holes , unless their mass accretion history is always associated with efficient jet production .",
    "the most likely explanation is that @xmath6 lies in the range @xmath96 .",
    "such a relatively high @xmath6 lies slightly above the 68 per cent confidence limits from _",
    "wmap _ , but is consistent with the current data at the @xmath8 level .",
    "since the measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath9 are highly correlated in the _ wmap _ analysis , this means that @xmath9 is also likely to be higher than the formal best - fit value of @xmath97 .",
    "this has important implications for the abundance of collapsed objects prior to re - ionisation ( reed et al .",
