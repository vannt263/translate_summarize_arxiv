    "<S> the response of the resonator rises rapidly to a maximum at the gap edge of the superconductor . from there on the response drops to half the maximum response at twice the pair - breaking energy . at higher frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> the response rises again due to trapping of pair - breaking phonons in the superconductor . in practice </S>",
    "<S> this is the first measurement of the frequency dependence of the quasiparticle creation efficiency due to pair - breaking in a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency , calculated from the different non - equilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions at each frequency , is in agreement with the measurements .    in a superconductor at low temperature , </S>",
    "<S> most of the electrons are bound in cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these pairs can be broken into quasiparticles by absorbing photons with an energy larger than the binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is frequently used to detect submillimetre and terahertz radiation using conventional superconductors such as aluminium . </S>",
    "<S> pair - breaking detectors are usually assumed to measure the number of quasiparticles created by the absorbed radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the observable that measures the number of quasiparticles varies from the complex conductivity for microwave kinetic inductance detectors @xcite ( mkids ) , the current through a tunnel junction @xcite to the capacitance of a small superconducting island @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observables are mainly sensitive to quasiparticles with an energy close to the gap energy of the superconductor , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the working principle of these detectors is usually explained in terms of an effective number of quasiparticles which is maintained by a balance between the radiation power and electron - phonon interaction ( recombination ) @xcite . to convert the power ( @xmath1 ) into a number of quasiparticles ( @xmath2 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle creation efficiency @xmath3 is introduced , which compares the actual @xmath2 with the maximum possible @xmath2 when all created quasiparticles would have an energy @xmath0 . since cooper pairs </S>",
    "<S> have a binding energy of @xmath4 , a photon with an energy in between @xmath4 and @xmath5 can still only create two quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the energy is lost through electron - phonon scattering , hence @xmath6 . for higher energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 depends on the phonon trapping factor , which determines whether high energy phonons are directly lost or can break an additional pair . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is therefore not an efficiency in the sense that photons are lost , but it reduces the detector responsivity . </S>",
    "<S> mkids are superconducting microwave resonators which sense the number of quasiparticles through the complex conductivity of the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the phase response ( @xmath7 ) of such a resonator can be approximated by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the imaginary part of the complex conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> for the last proportionality we assume to be in the linear regime where the quasiparticle recombination lifetime does not change significantly upon a change in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is dominated by background power and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , and hence the detector response , is dependent on the frequency of the absorbed photons , even at constant absorbed power .    on a microscopic level </S>",
    "<S> , the pair - breaking radiation leads to injection of quasiparticles at very specific energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with electron - phonon interaction ( scattering and recombination ) @xcite a non - equilibrium , non - thermal quasiparticle energy distribution @xmath11 is formed , which determines the response to pair - breaking radiation as recently shown in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> for microwave resonators this is reflected in the explicit dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12g_2(e)de , \\label{eq : sigmatwo}\\\\ g_2(e ) & = & \\frac{e^2+\\delta^2+\\hbar\\omega e}{(\\delta^2-e^2)^{1/2}[(e+\\hbar\\omega)^2-\\delta^2]^{1/2 } } ,   \\label{eq : g1g2f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the normal state conductivity , @xmath14 planck s constant and @xmath15 the microwave frequency . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is thus an attempt to capture all information contained in @xmath11 in a single number , to allow for an effective quasiparticle number approach as given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : responsenqp ] .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first measurement of @xmath3 over a broad range in frequencies close to the superconducting gap ( 350 - 1100 ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> a ta mkid is used as the detector in a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) to measure the frequency dependence of the response . </S>",
    "<S> the measured response curve of the detector can be well explained by a frequency dependent @xmath3 , caused by a different non - equilibrium @xmath11 calculated for different pair - breaking frequencies .    from an applied point of view mkids @xcite </S>",
    "<S> are considered promising detectors for large arrays due to the intrinsic ease of multiplexing their readout . </S>",
    "<S> mkids are photon noise limited for various frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the level of experimental detail that has now been achieved @xcite calls for a more detailed understanding of the absorption of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> an important gap in this understanding is a measurement of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 determines key parameters : the responsivity of the detector , the recombination noise level in the photon - noise limited regime @xcite and the sensitivity in the generation - recombination noise dominated limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the common number used for @xmath3 is 0.57 for all signal frequencies , which was derived for the temporal relaxation of very high energy excitations which first create a photo - electron @xcite , an approach which is not applicable for frequencies close to the gap .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) schematic of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the detector chip is fabricated on a sin membrane and glued to an elliptical lens , leaving a small vacuum gap between the antenna and the lens - dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the design of the detector chip . the antenna slot , coupled to a microwave resonator , is fabricated on a sin membrane ( light grey square ) . the resonator is capacitively coupled to a microwave readout line . ]    previous studies of the absorption of radiation in superconductors have either measured @xmath11 directly with tunnel - junctions @xcite , but only with a single - frequency optical laser , or measured the absorption over a broad band with a bolometer @xcite , which is insensitive to the non - equilibrium effects that determine @xmath3 . to measure @xmath3 over a broad frequency band , a known and relatively constant radiation power over a broad frequency band is required . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we need the absorption of all of that power at all frequencies within the volume of the detector to exclude the effect of frequency dependent absorption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore use a particularly wideband lens - antenna system , which is based on the leaky - wave antenna @xcite and shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : leaky ] . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a 30 @xmath16 m wide , 4 mm long slot , etched in a 200 nm thick ta film with a resistivity of @xmath17 @xmath18 cm , which is sputter deposited onto a 3 @xmath16 m thick sin membrane using a 6 nm nb seed layer . a spacer chip , placed in between the ta and the si lens ensures a 35 @xmath16 m vacuum gap between the metal layer and the si lens , which is crucial to get a high directivity of the antenna over a broad frequency band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this lens - antenna was demonstrated to have very clean beampatterns over the frequency range 300 - 900 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the antenna launches the signal as a travelling wave into a coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) with a central strip of 3.5 @xmath16 m and slots of 3 @xmath16 m wide , which length is designed to make a quarter wavelength resonator at 4.6571 ghz ( the mkid detector ) . </S>",

    "<S> the cryostat has optical access through a window , goretex infrared blockers at 77 k and 4 k , a 1.1 thz lowpass filter at 4 k. the michelson fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) consists of a globar source at 2000 , a fixed and a movable mirror and a mylar beamsplitter . to eliminate absorption lines due to water , the fts </S>",
    "<S> is placed in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the mkid itself is the detector in this setup . </S>",
    "<S> the phase response of the detector was measured as a function of the mirror distance . </S>",
    "<S> the phase response is linear in power , which is verified using the response to a full rotation of a polariser in a separate measurement ( i.e. the last proportionality in eq . </S>",

    "<S> fig : measuredfts ] as black dots , which is the central result of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> the beamsplitter response contains a cross - polarisation contribution of 28@xmath215 % , which is derived by integrating the measured beampatterns of the antenna @xcite over the opening angle of the source ( supplementary note 1 ) . the other contribution to the error bars on the data </S>",
    "<S> is given by the uncertainty in the exact beamsplitter thickness @xmath22 @xmath16 m .    </S>",
    "<S> the power as a function of frequency that arrives at the detector waveguide input can be calculated using @xmath23 with @xmath24 the speed of light , @xmath25 the solid angle , @xmath26 the transmission of optical elements ( filters , beamsplitter ) , @xmath27 the brightness of the source given by planck s law , @xmath28 the antenna efficiency and @xmath29 the antenna gain pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath30 reflects a single mode throughput . for the purpose of the present experiment </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to know the relative power at each frequency . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> the beam patterns are measured in three frequency windows : 290 - 350 ghz , 640 - 710 ghz and 790 - 910 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the directivity for these bands is compensated by the difference in the part of the source that they capture . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness of the blackbody at the measured frequencies can be well described in the rayleigh - jeans limit , where @xmath31 , which exactly compensates the frequency dependence due to the throughput @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the antenna efficiency is the only element from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : power ] that introduces a frequency dependence , as shown in supplementary figure 2 . using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : power ] we estimate the absorbed pair - breaking power from the fts to be 15 nw . the transmission of the optical elements @xmath26 is taken into account in the correction of the measured response as explained above .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : measuredfts ] , starting from 200 ghz , we observe no response until 320 ghz where the absorption rises drastically because photons have enough energy to break cooper pairs ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this steep rise in response is partially the well - known absorption edge of the superconductor @xcite : the frequency dependent absorption of a plain superconducting film through the complex sheet impedance . </S>",
    "<S> however in this experiment the antenna collects the radiation and launches it as a travelling wave into the mkid cpw . for frequencies well above the gap , it takes only 1 mm to absorb 90% of the power , thus all power is absorbed in the detector volume . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the non - monotonous sheet resistance for frequencies above the gap does not affect the measured response in this experiment , which is crucial to make the non - equilibrium response of the superconductor visible . </S>",
    "<S> the percentage of the power absorbed in the cpw line is calculated using the attenuation constant of a cpw @xcite based on the frequency dependent complex conductivity of the ta film following mattis and bardeen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the absorption length to be 10.4 mm , twice the length of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> radiation that is not absorbed ( only for @xmath32 ) will be reemitted by the antenna . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature of the superconductor is assumed to be 1.2 k , to be consistent with a linear response to 15 nw of fts signal ( @xmath2 is dominated by the effective temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting frequency dependent absorption is shown as the green line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : measuredfts ] . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum around 550 ghz is due to the simulated efficiency of the antenna , which is also taken into account ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) .    for frequencies higher than 400 ghz , </S>",
    "<S> the power received by the antenna is fully absorbed in the detector waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> however , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : measuredfts]a we observe a drop in the response close to 650 ghz ( @xmath5 ) by about a factor of two , after which the response increases again . having taken into account all frequency dependent power contributions , the only parameter left is the frequency dependence of the non - equilibrium response of the superconductor , represented by @xmath3 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : responsenqp ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles is calculated using a quasiparticle creation term that describes the probability of creating a quasiparticle at a certain energy by breaking a cooper pair following eliashberg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in steady state , the injection of quasiparticles at that energy is balanced by electron - phonon interaction ( scattering and recombination ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic equations for the non - equilibrium quasiparticle- and phonon energy distributions are solved following the approach by chang and scalapino @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical procedure is explained in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> in the modelling we used an effective bath temperature of 1.2 k to account for the broadband power absorbed by the detector . </S>",
    "<S> it was not necessary for this temperature to be exact as @xmath3 is not strongly dependent on the bath temperature at low reduced temperatures ( here @xmath33 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting distribution functions @xmath11 _ for constant absorbed power _ are shown for various frequencies in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : distributionfunctions]a . for higher excitation frequencies </S>",
    "<S> there are more quasiparticles with a higher energy , and therefore less weight close to the gap , where the resonator is sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect the maximum resonator signal at @xmath34 and a minimum at @xmath35 . the pair breaking efficiency , @xmath3 , calculated from these distribution functions is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> it was shown by guruswamy et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the behaviour of @xmath11 for frequencies higher than @xmath35 crucially depends on the phonon trapping factor . </S>",

    "<S> ta on si we obtain @xmath41 ns @xcite , which gives a trapping factor of 87 , which makes ta a favourable choice ( over e.g. al ) to experimentally address the effect of phonon trapping . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to estimate the precise trapping factor because the substrate is a relatively thin membrane and because of the nb seed layer , but it is certainly large . in practice </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : measuredfts ] qualitatively distinguishes the non - equilibrium response from other frequency dependent phenomena .    when cooper pairs are broken , the created high energy quasiparticles relax back to energies close to the gap on a timescale of 0.1 - 10 ns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the response can well be described by an effective number of quasiparticles @xmath2 @xcite using @xmath3 as in eq . </S>",

    "<S> the ( almost ) linear relationship between those properties ( eq . [ eq : responsenqp ] ) is demonstrated in figures . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : distributionfunctions]b and c. we emphasise that although these figures and eq . </S>",

    "<S> an effective @xmath2 or effective temperature model @xcite which may well describe a measurement at one specific frequency , even of the full @xmath11 @xcite , would give constant @xmath2 for constant absorbed power , regardless of the excitation frequency . </S>",

    "<S> the absorbed power was kept constant , and the resulting variation is thus only an effect of the frequency of the absorbed photons . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : measuredfts ] is very good , especially the peak around @xmath4 and the characteristic @xmath5 point are well represented . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation that occurs at higher frequencies is most likely due to an incomplete understanding of the combination of the fts system with the lens - antenna . except for the mentioned uncertainties , </S>",
    "<S> the antenna efficiency and absorption length are not independently measured and the removal of the residual ripple in the response is not exact . to get a deviation smaller than the </S>",

    "<S> we note that the characteristic impedance of the waveguide ( @xmath47 ) is also frequency dependent , but it changes the power transmitted from antenna to waveguide by only 0.1% . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion length of quasiparticles in ta is 2 @xmath16 m based on a recombination time of 50 ns ( for an effective temperature of 1.2 k ) and a diffusion constant of 0.8 @xmath48s@xmath49 ( refs . and the measured resistivity ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of diffusion of quasiparticles from the central strip at the antenna feed is therefore negligible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we checked that for this geometry radiation losses are a factor 10 lower than absorption in the superconductor @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured energy gap in the fts response occurs at 324 ghz , corresponding to a @xmath50 of 4.4 k , assuming @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> we presume that the nb seed layer is thicker than anticipated giving a thin layer with a somewhat higher @xmath50 dominating the dc transport , whereas the radiation absorption is dominated by the lower gap in the thick ta top layer .    </S>",
    "<S> the microwave readout power can strongly affect the response of a microwave resonator @xcite . in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> we can neglect effects due to the absorbed readout power ( 1.8 nw ) , which is much smaller than the absorbed pair - breaking signal ( 15 nw ) . </S>",
    "<S> readout power effects are only expected in the opposite limit @xcite , which is nevertheless important to investigate in the future . </S>",
    "<S> the observed agreement of the measurements with the model is encouraging . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time it underlines the importance of understanding and controlling these parameters to optimise superconducting detectors .    </S>",
