    "in the asymptotic - free gauge theories such as yang  mills theory and qcd , observables are obtained in the physical unit once the coupling constants of the theory are fixed at a chosen energy scale . in lattice gauge theory , this procedure",
    "is conveniently accomplished by identifying the energy scale with the inverse lattice spacing ( @xmath7 ) . in actual applications ,",
    "accurate determination of the relation between the lattice spacing and the gauge coupling is crucial not only for obtaining the observables in the physical unit but also for the continuum extrapolation of the numerical results .    to derive such a relation , the reference scales , e.g.  the string tension  @xcite and the sommer scale  @xcite ,",
    "have been widely used in the literature . in the determination of these quantities in the lattice unit ,",
    "the heavy - quark potential  @xmath8 for a certain range of the distance",
    "@xmath9 needs to be fitted , which inevitably introduces some systematic errors .",
    "recently , a novel concept , the yang - mills gradient flow , was proposed in  ref .",
    "@xcite , and attracts wide attention both analytically and numerically . it provides us with conceptual and numerical advantages in lattice simulations  @xcite . in particular , the gradient flow can be used to define proper energy - momentum tensor on the lattice  @xcite , which opens a new possibility to study the thermodynamics in lattice field theories  @xcite . to determine the reference scale with the gradient flow , a dimensionless observable such as @xmath10 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) for the definition ) is measured as a function of the flow time  @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath2 at which the observable takes a specific value is used for the reference scale .",
    "this method does not require the fitting procedure unlike the previous ones .",
    "moreover , the statistical errors turned out to be substantially small compared to those of  @xmath8  @xcite . a variant of this method was also proposed in  ref .",
    "@xcite , where high - precision scale setting in lattice qcd is attempted .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to determine the relation between the lattice spacing ( @xmath0 ) and the bare coupling ( @xmath11 ) in the su(3 ) yang  mills theory with the wilson gauge action over a wide range of  @xmath1 with high accuracy using the yang  mills gradient flow .",
    "such a determination is useful for studying , e.g.  the precision thermodynamics of the su(3 ) yang  mills theory  @xcite . in the previous studies with the wilson gauge action",
    "@xcite , the range of  @xmath1 covered was @xmath12 . on the other hand , in the present study , by exploiting the benefit of the gradient flow together with the recent advance in computational power , we go into a weaker coupling region , @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "moreover , to suppress the finite volume effect for the two finest lattices ( @xmath15 and @xmath14 ) , the lattice volume  @xmath16 is taken for those cases .    following the procedures proposed in  refs .",
    "@xcite , we consider the dimensionless observables @xmath17 and  @xmath18 and fix their values to be  @xmath19 to determine the reference scale .",
    "we vary @xmath19 in order to suppress both the lattice spacing and finite volume effects below the magnitude of the statistical error .",
    "this enables us to derive accurate relation between @xmath0 and  @xmath1 for the wide range of lattice spacing with an accuracy of less than  @xmath20 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gf ] , we introduce the gradient flow and define our reference scales .",
    "we then present our numerical results of the dimensionless observables in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] . after describing our numerical setup , detailed analyses on the discretization and finite volume effects are performed .",
    "the parametrization of the lattice spacing in terms of  @xmath1 and comparisons with previous studies without the gradient flow are also presented in this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we give a brief summary .",
    "the gradient flow is a continuous transformation of fields ; for gauge fields , it is defined by the differential equation  @xcite , @xmath21 with the yang  mills action @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 .",
    "color indices are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath24 is identified with the standard gauge field defined in four dimensional space - time .",
    "the flow time  @xmath2 , having a dimension of inverse mass - squared , controls the flow into the extra dimension .",
    "the gauge field is transformed along the steepest descent direction of  @xmath22 as @xmath2 increases . in the tree level , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) is rewritten as @xmath25 which is essentially a diffusion equation . for positive  @xmath2 , therefore , the gradient flow acts as the cooling of the gauge field with the smearing radius  @xmath26 . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , it is rigorously proved that all composite operators composed of  @xmath23 take finite values for  @xmath27 .",
    "this property ensures that observables at  @xmath27 are automatically renormalized .",
    "one of the composite operators whose @xmath2 dependence is extensively studied is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the `` field strength '' composed of  @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the vacuum expectation value of  eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) for small  @xmath2 is obtained perturbatively up to next - to - leading order as  @xcite @xmath30 , \\label{eq : t2epert}\\ ] ] with  @xmath31 in the @xmath32 scheme and @xmath33 being the number of color .",
    "the running coupling  @xmath34 is defined at the scale of the smearing radius , @xmath35 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : t2epert ] ) implies that the dimensionless quantity @xmath10 is an increasing function of  @xmath2 for small flow time corresponding to the perturbative regime . as shown numerically in  ref .",
    "@xcite on the lattice , @xmath10 is also a monotonically increasing function for large @xmath2 corresponding to the non - perturbative regime .",
    "therefore , the value of  @xmath2 at which @xmath10 takes a specific value  @xmath19 , i.e. , the solution of the equation @xmath36 is expected to be a unique dimensionful quantity , which can be used as a reference scale to introduce physical unit in lattice gauge theory . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath37 ( sometimes called  @xmath38 ) is used as the reference scale . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , a quantity  @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 is proposed as an alternative reference scale . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , a reference scale  @xmath41 ( sometimes called  @xmath42 ) is employed to set the scale and it was found that the discretization error of  @xmath43 is suppressed more than that of  @xmath44 in full qcd  @xcite .    in the present study we consider more general reference scales , @xmath45 and  @xmath39 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and  @xmath48 .",
    "larger @xmath19 is preferable to suppress the lattice discretization error  @xcite , while the smearing radius  @xmath26 would eventually hit the lattice boundary for too large  @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the numerical cost increases as @xmath19 increases , since more time - steps are required for solving the differential equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath49 and  @xmath50 for the reference scales and introduce a new parametrization of the lattice spacing  @xmath0 in terms of the bare coupling  @xmath11 by a hybrid use of these reference scales .",
    "we perform numerical analyses of the su(3 ) yang  mills theory with the wilson plaquette action in the present study .",
    "gauge configurations are generated by a combination of one heatbath and five overrelaxation updates ; we refer this set for updates as one monte carlo update .",
    "we perform @xmath51 monte carlo updates for the thermalization from the cold start , and analyze configurations separated by @xmath52 updates after the thermalization .",
    "we take the periodic boundary condition with the lattice size  @xmath53 .",
    "the values of  @xmath11 , @xmath54 and the number of configurations @xmath55 are summarized in  table  [ table : param ] . for @xmath56 , @xmath57 and  @xmath58",
    ", we take two different values of  @xmath54 to investigate the finite volume effect . in our main analysis",
    ", we use the data with  @xmath5 for  @xmath13@xmath59 , @xmath60 for  @xmath56@xmath57 and @xmath61 for  @xmath15@xmath14 .",
    "these data sets are indicated by  @xmath62 in the last column of the table . as we will show in  sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] , the finite volume effect is well suppressed for these choices .",
    "autocorrelation between different configurations is analyzed by the dependence of the jackknife statistical errors against the bin - size , @xmath63 , together with the autocorrelation function . for  @xmath5 , we found no @xmath63 dependence , so that different configurations are uncorrelated .",
    "for @xmath60 and  @xmath6 , the statistical error increases up to about  @xmath64 as @xmath63 increases in  @xmath65 .",
    "then , we make the jackknife error estimate with  @xmath66 in these cases .",
    "the autocorrelation function shows that the autocorrelation is not visible within statistics already with one separation of @xmath52 updates , which is consistent with the analysis of the bin - size dependence .",
    "the autocorrelation of the topological charge is known to become longer as the lattice spacing becomes finer due to the critical slowing down @xcite .",
    "our analyses with separations of @xmath52 updates may suffer from this problem and therefore should be understood with reservation .",

    "( [ eq : gf ] ) and that of the observable  @xmath67 are not unique  @xcite .",

    ", we use the clover - type representation of  @xmath69 unless otherwise stated .",
    "other choices of  @xmath68 and  @xmath67 may reduce the discretization effect further  @xcite . to solve the differential equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) numerically , we use the second - order runge  kutta ( rk ) method . to estimate the numerical error of the rk method",
    ", we have solved the rk with two different integration step sizes , one of which is twice coarser than the other , for several configurations . by comparing these results",
    "we have checked that the numerical error of the rk method is within two orders of magnitude smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "( this procedure may be improved by the method suggested and tested in refs .",
    "@xcite . )    to illustrate the behaviors of  @xmath10 and  @xmath3 , we show these quantities with statistical errors as a function of  @xmath70 in  fig .  [",

    "to check the discretization effect on the operator , we compare @xmath10 and @xmath3 defined from the clover - type representation with those defined from  @xmath72 using the average plaquette  @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that the difference between the two definitions is suppressed for large  @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the difference is more suppressed in  @xmath3 than that in  @xmath10 , i.e. , the discretization effect in the former is smaller than the latter .",
    "the figure also shows that both quantities increase monotonically as  @xmath70 increases except for the small  @xmath70 region where the lattice distortion effect is sizable .",
    "furthermore , they show approximately linear behavior within the range @xmath74 .",
