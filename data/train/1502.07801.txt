    "magnetic flux rope ( mfr ) is a current channel with magnetic field lines wrapping around its central axis by more than one turn .",
    "such a coherently helical structure frequently erupts from the sun , forming a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) in the lower corona @xcite , and then propagating into the interplanetary space taking a form of magnetic cloud as indicated by features including the magnetic field rotation , the drop of density and proton temperature , and the low plasma beta in the in - situ data @xcite .",
    "previous observations have shown that mfrs probably exist in the corona prior to their eruption .",
    "based on the different origins , mfrs can be divided into two categories .",
    "one type originates from long decayed active regions and appears as dark cavities in visible or extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) passbands when viewed at the solar limb @xcite .",
    "the spinning motions @xcite , bright ring @xcite , and ",
    "lagomorphic \" structure of linear polarization in the cavities @xcite have been disclosed and considered to be strong evidence of helical structures .",
    "this type of mfrs also displays as filament channels when seen at the solar disk , the counterpart of the cavities , in which the emission is much weaker than the background in euv passbands but the magnetic field is well organized and probably includes dips @xcite . distinguishing from cavities , the other group of mfrs stems from mature active regions , manifesting themselves as forward or reversed sigmoids in soft x - ray ( sxr ) and euv passbands @xcite .",
    "a number of independent case studies have shown that the strongly twisted field lines and the sigmoidal emission pattern can be successfully reproduced in extrapolated non - linear force free structures @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite discovered another piece of observational evidence for the existence of mfrs in mature active regions , i.e. , an elongated euv channel - like structure in the high temperature passbands of the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hot channel initially appears as a twisted sigmoidal structure and then evolves to a semicircular one in the early rise phase .",
    "quickly , it drives the formation and acceleration of a cme with the aid of the flare reconnection @xcite .",
    "further studies including the continuous evolution of the mfr from the inner to outer corona as a coherent structure @xcite , the relationship between the hot channel and associated prominence @xcite , and the finding of reduced temperature but enhanced emission measure at the lower part of filament - associated hot channel @xcite further support that the hot channel is actually the helical mfr itself .",
    "although much evidence has revealed the existence of mfrs , when and where they are built up are still unknown .",
    "theoretically , one possibility could be that the mfr is generated in the convection zone and partly emerges into the corona by buoyancy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other possibility is that the mfr is created directly in the corona either through flux cancellation in the photosphere prior to the eruption @xcite or by tether - cutting @xcite , breakout @xcite , and flare reconnection @xcite in the corona during the eruption . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the formation and initiation of two mfrs and in particular , present for the first time the spectral features related to this process .",

    "in this paper , we investigate the formation and initiation of two mfrs through imaging and spectral observations by aia and _ iris_. the euv observations show that the magnetic field involved in the formation of the mfrs is primarily within in the core field of the active regions and is organized as two groups of sheared arcades .",
    "their appearance only in the 131  and 94  passbands but not in other cooler passbands indicates that the arcades have a temperature of @xmath77 mk . through examining a sequence of line - of - sight magnetograms of the hmi ( figure [ fmag ] and attached movies )",

    ", we suggest that the reconnection driven by the photospheric flows most likely take place and play a vital role in the formation of mfrs . on one hand",
    ", the reconnection may connect the head and end of two sheared arcades to form a continuous sigmoidal loop and accumulate the poloidal field of the mfr . on the other hand",
    ", it simultaneously heats the plasma in the mfr to make it only visible in the high temperature passbands of the aia .    _ iris",

    "moreover , the finding of the cospatiality of the cool filamentary materials , which are visible in the aia 304  and 171  passbands , with the brightened sigmoidal field also supports the hypothesis that the formation of the mfr2 may extend to the chromosphere .    the different formation altitudes between the mfr1 and mfr2 emphasizes the diversity of the reconnection locations , which can range from the photosphere to the corona .",
    "the results are consistent with the recent conclusions by @xcite , in which they studied the long - term evolution of a sigmoidal active region and found that the twist in the core field gradually increases with reconnection continuously converting the sheared arcades to the sigmoidal field both at the bald - patch in the photosphere and in the hyperbolic flux tube in the corona .    _ iris _",
    "spectral data further disclose some new features of the formation and initiation of the mfrs .",
    "for the mfr1 , the si iv , c ii , and mg ii lines present a redshift and slightly large non - thermal velocity at the footpoints during the initiation phase . we interpret this as being caused by reconnect - induced outflow , which propagates along the legs of the mfr1 and finally reaches the lower atmosphere at the footpoints .",
    "note that in flare ribbons , one can observe stronger redshift ( or blueshift ) and broadening of various lines that are mostly caused by chromospheric evaporation and/or condensation driven by the non - thermal electrons generated during the fast reconnection @xcite . in the case of the initiation of the mfr1 , however , the redshift and broadening at the footpoints may instead be related to the outflow driven by the reconnection surrounding or inside the mfr1 that seems more gentle .",
    "recent detection of a pre - flare enhancement of the non - thermal velocity at the footpoints of a cme @xcite also supports such an interpretation .    for the mfr2 ,",
    "the _ iris _ slit is positioned at its formation site . generally , the si iv , c ii , and mg ii lines show an extremely strong blueshift and non - thermal broadening at the most brightened pixels in the formation site .",
    "if it is still explained in terms of the reconnection scenario , then it requires that the reconnection has to occur in a place low enough so that either upward moving energetic electrons or reconnection outflow can heat the plasma above , and thus result in the blueshift and broadening of the mg ii , c ii , and si iv lines .",
    "nevertheless , at some weakly brightened pixels at the formation site , the three lines display complicated patterns that seem puzzling .",
    "the mg ii line is blueshifted without ambiguity .",
    "however , the si iv and c ii lines exhibit a stronger red wing . checking the line profiles , we are more inclined to the interpretation of an absorption at the blue wing , which can also be related to an upward moving plasma with a temperature not high enough to make it emissive relative to the si iv and c ii background emission ( also see ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reconnection scenario also expects the appearance of a downflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for the mfr2 , we only detect the upflow .",
    "a possible reason is that the downflow is kinetically less obvious than the upflow and could be smeared out in the spectra owing to the radiative transfer effect along the line of sight .    as a conclusion , based on the aia and _ iris _ joint observations ,",

    ", we suppose that the reconnection site is in the middle chromosphere , where the non - thermal particles accelerated during the reconnection can move upwards and lead to the large blueshift and strong broadening of the si iv , c ii , and even mg ii lines .",

    "<S> helical magnetic flux rope ( mfr ) is a fundamental structure of corona mass ejections ( cmes ) and has been discovered recently to exist as a sigmoidal channel structure prior to its eruption in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) high temperature passbands of the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when and where the mfr is built up are still elusive . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate two mfrs ( mfr1 and mfr2 ) in detail , whose eruptions produced two energetic solar flares and cmes on 2014 april 18 and 2014 september 10 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the aia euv images reveal that for a long time prior to their eruption , both mfr1 and mfr2 are under formation , which is probably through magnetic reconnection between two groups of sheared arcades driven by the shearing and converging flows in the photosphere near the polarity inversion line . at the footpoints of the mfr1 , the _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ </S>",
    "<S> si iv , c ii , and mg ii lines exhibit weak to moderate redshifts and a non - thermal broadening in the pre - flare phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , a relatively large blueshift and an extremely strong non - thermal broadening are found at the formation site of the mfr2 . </S>",
    "<S> these spectral features consolidate the proposition that the reconnection plays an important role in the formation of mfrs . for the mfr1 , </S>",
    "<S> the reconnection outflow may propagate along its legs , penetrating into the transition region and the chromosphere at the footpoints . for the mfr2 </S>",
    "<S> , the reconnection probably takes place in the lower atmosphere and results in the strong blueshift and non - thermal broadening for the mg ii , c ii , and si iv lines .    online - only material : animations , color figures </S>"
