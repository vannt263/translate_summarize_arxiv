    "_ universal joints _ with full rotational freedom . additionally , the bars and joints are symmetric with respect to the action of a point group @xmath0 .",
    "the allowed motions preserve the _ length _ and _ connectivity _ of the bars and _ symmetry _ with respect to the same group @xmath0 .",
    "this model is very similar in spirit to that of the _ periodic frameworks _ , introduced in @xcite , that have recently received a lot of attention , motivated mainly by applications to zeolites @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion of the history .",
    "when all the allowed motions are euclidean isometries , a framework is _ rigid _ and otherwise it is _ flexible_. in this paper , we give a _ combinatorial _",

    ", we call these _ cone frameworks _ and _ reflection frameworks _ respectively . since these @xmath0 are isomorphic to some @xmath4 for an integer @xmath5 , we also make this identification from now on .",
    "formally , a @xmath0-framework is given by a triple @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a finite graph , @xmath8 is a @xmath0-action on @xmath7 that is free on the vertices and edges , and @xmath9 is a vector of positive _ edge lengths _ assigned to the edges of @xmath7 .",
    "a _ realization _",
    "@xmath10 is an assignment of points @xmath11 such that : @xmath12 the set of all realizations is defined to be the _ realization space _ @xmath13 . since we require symmetry with respect to a fixed subgroup @xmath14 and not all rigid motions of the points preserve the symmetry , the correct notion of configuration space is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the centralizer of @xmath0 in @xmath17 .",
    "a realization is _ rigid _ if it is isolated in the configuration space and otherwise _",
    "flexible_. a realization is _ minimally rigid _",
    "if it is rigid but ceases to be so after removing any @xmath0-orbit of edges from @xmath7 .",
    "this definition of rigidity corresponds to the intuitive one given above , since a result of milnor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) implies that if a point is not isolated in the configuration space , there is a smooth path through it .",
    "an equivalent formulation of rigidity is that the only continuous length - preserving , symmetry - preserving motions are `` trivial '' . in this case , the trivial motions are precisely @xmath16 which is one - dimensional for both rotational and reflective symmetry .    as the combinatorial model for cone and reflection frameworks",
    "it will be more convenient to use colored graphs . similarly to @xcite , we define a _ _ colored graph _ _ @xmath18 to be a finite , directed graph @xmath19 , with an assignment @xmath20 of an element of a group @xmath0 to each edge . a straightforward specialization of covering space theory ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * section 9 ) ) associates @xmath21 with a colored graph @xmath18 : @xmath19 is the quotient of @xmath7 by @xmath0 , and the colors encode the covering map @xmath22 via a natural map @xmath23 . in this",
    "setting , the choice of base vertex does not matter , and indeed , we may define @xmath24 and obtain the same theory . see section [ sec : rho ] for the definition of @xmath25 via the colors .",
    "[ [ remark ] ] remark + + + + + +    for our main theorems , we require that the symmetry group act freely on vertices and edges . removing this restriction , one can realize , in the case of rotational symmetry , a framework where the group acts with a fixed vertex and with inverted edges .",
    "it is easy to reduce problems of rigidity for nonfree actions to free actions , and we do so in section [ sec : rotnonfree ] . in the case of reflection symmetry",
    ", we can similarly extend our rigidity results to actions with inverted edges ( but not fixed vertices or edges ) by reducing to free actions .",

    "genericity has its standard meaning from algebraic geometry : the set of non - generic realizations @xmath26 is a proper algebraic subset of the potential choices for @xmath27 .",
    "whether a graph is cone - laman and reflection - laman can be checked by efficient , combinatorial algorithms @xcite , making theorems [ theo : cone - laman ] and [ theo : reflection - laman ] good characterizations as well as entirely analogous to the maxwell - laman theorem @xcite , which gives the combinatorial characterization for generic bar - joint frameworks in the plane .",
    "[ [ remark-1 ] ] remark + + + + + +    the approach to genericity is the one from @xcite .",
    "we choose it because it is more computationally effective than ones based on algebraic independence , and also less technical . since genericity is a zariski - open condition ,",
    "standard results imply that : the non - generic set of @xmath27 has measure zero ; for a generic @xmath27 , there is an open neighborhood @xmath28 that contains only generic points ; every generic @xmath27 is a regular point of the rigidity map that sends @xmath27 to the edge lengths in @xmath26 ( or , indeed , any other polynomial map ) ; the rank of the linear system for infinitesimal motions ( described below ) is maximal over all choices of @xmath27 .",
    "some of these are sometimes taken to be defining properties of the generic set in the literature .",
    "the relevant algebraic geometry facts are collected in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) .",
    "as in all known proofs of `` maxwell - laman - type '' theorems such as theorems [ theo : cone - laman ] and [ theo : reflection - laman ] , we give a combinatorial characterization of a linearization of the problem known as _ generic infinitesimal rigidity_. given a realization @xmath10 , a set of vectors",
    "@xmath29 is an",
    "_ infinitesimal motion _ of @xmath10 if it satisfies @xmath30 the system ( [ eq : infmot-1])([eq : infmot-2 ] ) arises by computing the formal differential of ( [ eq : lengths-1])([eq : lengths-2 ] ) .",
    "geometrically , infinitesimal motions preserve the edge lengths to first order and preserve the symmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "a cone or reflection framework is _ infinitesimally rigid _ if the space of infinitesimal motions is precisely that induced by the trivial motions , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , the framework is infinitesimally rigid if and only if the space of infinitesimal motions is @xmath31-dimensional .",
    "as discussed above , the rank of the system ( [ eq : infmot-1])([eq : infmot-2 ] ) , which defines a rigidity matrix , is maximal at any generic point , so infinitesimal rigidity and rigidity coincide generically . in section [ sec : genericity2 ] we give a description of the non - generic set for cone frameworks ; the case of reflection frameworks is analogous .    to characterize infinitesimal rigidity , we use a _ direction network _ method ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a _ @xmath0-direction network _",
    "@xmath32 is a graph @xmath7 equipped with a free action @xmath33 and a symmetric assignment of directions with one direction @xmath34 per edge .",
    "the _ realization space _ of a direction network is the set of solutions @xmath10 to the system of equations : @xmath35 where , as above , @xmath0 is a finite group of rotations about the origin or the @xmath1-element group generated by a reflection .",
    "we call such a direction network a _ cone direction network _ in the former case and a _ reflection direction network _ in the latter case . by ( [ eq : dn - realization2 ] ) , a @xmath0-direction network is determined by assigning a direction to each edge of the colored quotient graph @xmath18 of @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "* lemma 17.2 ) ) .",
    "a realization of a @xmath0-direction network is _ faithful _ if none of the edges of its graph have coincident endpoints and _ collapsed _ if all the endpoints coincide .",
    "a basic fact in the theory of finite planar frameworks @xcite is that , if a direction network has faithful realizations , the dimension of the realization space is equal to that of the space of infinitesimal motions of a generic framework with the same underlying graph .",
    "this is also true for @xmath0-frameworks , if the symmetry group contains only orientation - preserving elements , as in @xcite , or the finite order rotations considered here .",
    "thus , a characterization of generic cone direction networks with a @xmath31-dimensional space of faithful realizations implies a characterization of generic minimal rigidity by a straightforward sequence of steps .",
    "we will show :    [ theo : cone - direction - network ] a generic cone direction network has a faithful realization that is unique up to scaling if and only if its associated colored graph is cone - laman .    from this , theorem [ theo : cone - laman ] follows using a slight modification of the arguments in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 17 - 18 ) , which we present quickly in section [ sec : cone - laman - proof ] where we will highlight where the proof breaks down for the reflection case .",
    "the main novelty in the proof of theorem [ theo : cone - direction - network ] is that we make a direct geometric argument for the key proposition [ prop : cone - collapse ] , since standard results on linear representations of matroid unions do nt apply to the system ( [ eq : dn - realization1])([eq : dn - realization2 ] ) .",
    "the situation for reflection direction networks is more complicated .",
    "the reasoning used to transition from direction networks to infinitesimal rigidity in the orientation - preserving case does _ not _ apply verbatim in the presence of reflections .",
    "thus , we will need to rely on a more technical analogue of theorem [ theo : cone - direction - network ] , which we state after giving an important definition .",
    "let @xmath32 be a direction network and define @xmath36 to be the direction network with @xmath37 .",
    "these two direction networks form a _ special pair _ if :    * @xmath32 has a , unique up to scale and ( vertical ) translation , faithful realization . * @xmath38 has only collapsed realizations .",
    "[ theo : reflection - direction - network ] let @xmath18 be a colored graph with @xmath39 vertices , @xmath40 edges , and lift @xmath21 .",
    "then there are directions @xmath41 such that the direction networks @xmath32 and @xmath38 are a special pair if and only if @xmath18 is reflection - laman .    briefly , we will use theorem [ theo : reflection - direction - network ] as follows : the faithful realization of @xmath32 gives a symmetric immersion of the graph @xmath7 that can be interpreted as a framework , and the fact that @xmath38 has only collapsed realizations will imply that the only symmetric infinitesimal motions of this framework correspond to translation parallel to the reflection axis .      this paper is part of a sequence extending our results about periodic frameworks @xcite , and the results ( and proofs ) reported here have been previously circulated in other preprints : theorems [ theo : cone - laman ] and [ theo : cone - direction - network ] in @xcite .",

    "this paper deals with the setting of `` forced symmetry '' , in which all the motions considered preserve the @xmath0-symmetry of the framework .",

    "tanigawa @xcite proves results for scene analysis and body - bar frameworks symmetric with respect to a large number of groups using a more matroidal method .",
    "much of the interest in forced symmetry arises from the study of periodic frameworks , which are symmetric with respect to a translation lattice .",
    "these appear in @xcite , though recent interest should be traced to the more general setup in @xcite .",
    "a maxwell - laman - type theorem for periodic frameworks in dimension @xmath1 appears in our paper @xcite .",
    "periodic frameworks admit a number of natural variants ; in dimension @xmath1 there are combinatorial rigidity characterizations for the fixed - lattice @xcite partially - fixed lattice with @xmath31-degree of freedom @xcite and fixed - area unit cell @xcite .",
    "this paper emerged from a project to extend the rigidity characterizations from @xcite to more symmetry groups ; the sequel @xcite has results for the orientation - preserving plane groups .    in dimensions",
    "@xmath43 , combinatorial rigidity characterizations for even finite bar - joint frameworks are not known .",
    "the forced - symmetric case does not appear to be much easier .",
    "however , maxwell - type counting heuristics have been determined for a large number of space and point groups by ross , schulze and whiteley @xcite .",
    "all the combinatorial work mentioned so far approaches forced - symmetric frameworks in a similar formalism .",
    "another approach , used in @xcite is to study what , in our terminology , is the underlying graph of the colored graph .",
    "this leads to a theory of a somewhat different flavor .",
    "another direction in the study of symmetric frameworks is to not force the symmetry constraint .",
