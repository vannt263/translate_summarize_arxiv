    "ground - state hadron spectroscopy has been at the forefront of the studies performed by the lattice qcd community .",
    "the exponential decay behavior of the mass eigenstate contributions to euclidean - time correlators makes extraction of the lightest state straightforward : at large time separations , the ground - state mass naturally dominates the correlator , which then displays a single exponential in time .",
    "excited states , however , appear as subleading exponentials , which in practice are rather difficult to separate , not only from the ground - state contribution , but also from those due to other excited states .",
    "a few methods are currently in use to deal with this problem . a straightforward fit to a finite sum of exponentials is sometimes possible , usually when high statistics are available",
    ". constrained fitting @xcite and the maximum entropy method @xcite are also options , but these , like the first method , can encounter problems when faced with states which lie close in mass , or when unphysical contributions appear due to quenching ( ghosts ) .",
    "we employ a different method , one based upon the variational method devised by michael @xcite , and later elaborated by lscher and wolff @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic of our approach is the use of several hadron interpolators which contain quark wavefunctions covariantly smeared to approximate gaussians of different widths @xcite . using such a basis of source and sink operators , it is our plan to improve overlap with physical states which may involve a radial excitation . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", it has been demonstrated that this method also clearly separates ghost contributions .    in the present work ,",
    "we describe the method in detail and report results for the meson sector .",
    "another paper will contain our latest results for baryons .",
    "our calculation is based upon the variational method @xcite .",
    "the central idea is to use several different interpolators @xmath0 with the quantum numbers of the desired state and to compute all cross correlations @xmath1 in hilbert space these correlators have the decomposition @xmath2 using the factorization of the amplitudes one can show @xcite that the eigenvalues @xmath3 of the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath4 behave as @xmath5 \\ ; ,   \\label{eigenvaluedecay}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the mass of the @xmath7-th state and @xmath8 is the difference to the mass closest to @xmath6 @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ generalized ] ) the eigenvalue problem is normalized with respect to a timeslice @xmath9",
    ".    equation ( [ eigenvaluedecay ] ) shows that the eigenvalues each decay with their own mass : the largest eigenvalue decays with the mass of the ground state , the second largest eigenvalue with the mass of the first excited state , etc .",
    "thus , the variational method allows one to decompose the signal into those for ground and excited states , as well as ghost contributions @xcite , and therefore , simple , stable two - parameter fits become possible .",
    "we remark that also for the regular eigenvalue problem , @xmath10 a behavior of the type ( [ eigenvaluedecay ] ) can be shown @xcite .",
    "we find that in a practical implementation with our sources the results and the quality of the data are essentially unchanged whether we use the regular or the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the key to a successful application of the variational method is the choice of the basis interpolators",
    ". they should be linearly independent , and as orthogonal as possible , while at the same time , able to represent the physical state as well as possible .",
    "furthermore , they should be numerically cheap to implement .",
    "for meson spectroscopy it is well known that different dirac structures can be used to construct interpolators with the quantum numbers one is interested in . in this paper",
    "we consider interpolators of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 are flavor labels .",
    "we use matrix / vector notation for dirac and color indices and @xmath13 is an element of the clifford algebra .",
    "depending on what combination of gamma - matrices one uses for @xmath13 , the interpolator @xmath14 will have different quantum numbers .",
    "we list these in table  [ gammatable ] .    .",
    "quantum numbers of the interpolators ( ) for different choices of @xmath13 .",
    "we remark that the classification with respect to @xmath15 is for flavor degenerate interpolators only . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 were adjusted such that the narrow source approximates a gaussian with a half width ( i.e. , standard deviation ) of 0.27 fm and the wide source a gaussian with a half width of 0.41 fm .",
    "the corresponding smearing parameters are listed in table [ parametertable ] .",
    "the values of the smearing parameters are chosen such that simple linear combinations of our two sources allows one to approximate the ground- and first - excited state wavefunctions of the 3-d harmonic oscillator ( with a half width of @xmath18 fm for the ground state ) .",
    "we stress that we do not impose such linear combinations , but rather use the simple @xmath19 , @xmath20 sources for the basis interpolators in the variational method and leave it to the simulation to determine the physical superpositions .",
    "the interpolators which we actually consider in our correlation matrix are flavor triplet operators of the form , @xmath21 this avoids the need to calculate disconnected pieces . for a given clifford element @xmath13 both @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "sources can be wide or narrow which gives the 4 possibilities ( the subscripts @xmath24 denote the type of smearing used ) @xmath25 in addition , we have two choices for @xmath13 in the vector and pseudoscalar sectors such that for these cases we have a basis of 8 interpolators . for scalars and pseudovectors",
    "we restrict ourselves to 4 interpolators .    in the case of degenerate quark",
    "masses , @xmath26 and @xmath27 give rise to identical correlators .",
    "this fact reduces the correlation matrices to @xmath28 for vector and pseudoscalar states and to @xmath29 for scalar and pseudovector states . for the strange mesons , obtained by replacing the down quark in ( [ tripcorr ] ) by a strange quark ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted and we are free to work with the full @xmath30 and @xmath31 correlation matrices .    our quenched study is done with the lscher - weisz gauge action @xcite at two different values of the inverse gauge coupling @xmath32 . the lattice spacing @xmath33 was determined in @xcite using the sommer parameter .",
    "we use lattices of two different sizes , such that the spatial extent in physical units is kept constant at 2.4 fm .",
    "this allows us to compare the results at two different values of the cutoff , @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 mev . for the fermions we use the chirally",
    "improved dirac operator @xcite .",
    "it is an approximation of a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation @xcite , with good chiral behavior @xcite .",
    "the parameters of our calculation are collected in table  [ parametertable ] .",
    "we determine the strange quark mass via interpolations in the heavy - quark mass which match the ( light - quark mass extrapolated ) pseudoscalar k meson mass to the physical value .",
    "( these configurations have also been used in another study @xcite to determine low energy constants . )",
    "we remark that the ci operator has one term which is next - to - nearest neighbor .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when selecting fit ranges for masses . exactly what is to be considered a safe minimum time separation before fitting",
    "is not , however , a simple matter . in the present case ,",
    "we limit ourselves to values larger than @xmath36 .",
    "since this is a report on lattice spectroscopy , we begin the discussion of our results in the standard manner : with effective masses . having performed the necessary diagonalizations of the correlator matrices , we determine the effective masses from ratios of eigenvalues on adjacent timeslices : @xmath37 errors for such quantities are determined via a single - elimination jackknife procedure .",
    "we note that the quality of the plateaus which we obtain here can depend upon the basis chosen .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the various interpolators have different overlap with the states which contribute to the higher - order corrections in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvaluedecay ] ) ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "an appropriate choice of operator combination ( including the possibility of further limiting the basis ) can therefore minimize such corrections , improving the plateaus in effective mass ( and correspondingly , in the eigenvector components ) .    in fig .",

    ", the effective masses from the largest two eigenvalues ( largest three for the vectors on the fine lattice ) are displayed .",

    "there are already significant problems for the ground states . at small quark masses ,",
    "it becomes obvious that the pseudovectors suffer large quenching and/or finite - volume effects , causing an apparent enhancement of the mass .",
    "the upward curvature seen in the ground - state vectors ( at least on the coarse lattices ) and pseudovectors may be partly explained by quenching effects .",
    "quenched chiral perturbation theory for vector mesons @xcite predicts a negative @xmath60 term , which could certainly cause the observed enhancement at low quark masses .    for the scalar meson plot similar curvature is seen , and this despite the fact that our method removes the dominant influences of ghosts @xcite .",
    "the entire scalar plot also appears to be shifted vertically , making one wonder whether the ground - state @xmath61 scalar meson even corresponds to the @xmath62 .",
    "other lattice studies @xcite find that , in fact , it does not .    our interpolators may be a poor choice of operators for the pseudovector and scalar states .",
    "one might achieve better results by altering the @xmath63-wave nature of our smeared quark wavefunctions . in a future study ,",
    "we plan to apply covariant derivatives to our smeared sources , providing interpolators which better mimic @xmath64-wave orbital excitations and , hopefully , improving overlap with the pseudovector and scalar mesons .    in fig .",

    "the general picture here is similar to that seen for the degenerate - quark - mass pseudoscalar and vector mesons : again , perhaps partly due to somewhat large statistical errors for the excited states , the results for the pseudoscalar mesons appear consistent with the experimental values .",
    "the same also applies to the vector mesons on the fine lattices , while the coarse - lattice excited vector results appear systematically high .",

    "one can see that previously chosen fit ranges ( for the @xmath69 lattices ) may have been started at too small a value of @xmath70 , apparently enhancing the resulting masses when compared to our current results . since the physical spatial volume has been increased from 1.8 to 2.4 fm",
    "( the latter perhaps still being too small for excited - state spectroscopy ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one may be tempted to simply put this down as a finite - volume effect .",
    "however , since the later effective masses on the smaller lattices are consistent with the plateau found on the bigger ones , it is not easy to say whether this state is displaying effects due to the finite volume .",
    "the enhancement may also be due to higher state corrections , which still contribute since the minimum timeslice considered in the fit is too small . with better statistics on the @xmath69 lattices ( to make up for the smaller number of spatial sites )",
    ", we may end up finding a similar plateau to that seen on the @xmath71 lattices .",
    "similar effects are seen for the vector mesons .",
    "we suspect that this poorer level of statistics for the @xmath69 lattices , and the subsequent choice of fit ranges , may account for most of the relative enhancement of our earlier results for the excited meson masses .",
    "although we lack a third lattice spacing which would allow us to try to work in the continuum , we nevertheless attempt chiral extrapolations using the results from just our fine lattices ( see fig .",
    "[ ch_ex_mass ] ) . for the most part ,",
    "we use simple linear extrapolations ( interpolations for @xmath72 ) in @xmath54 and , when doing so , avoid the low quark mass region ( @xmath73 ) for the pseudovectors since these suffer obviously large systematics there .",
    "assuming quenched chiral effects similar to those experienced by vector mesons @xcite , we also allow for a @xmath74 term ( obviously negative ) in the fits for the pseudovector extrapolations and include all points .",

    "results for the vectors on the coarser lattices suggest either that we have `` missed '' the first excitation ( slightly lighter effective mass plateaus were seen in another eigenvalue , but without corresponding plateaus for the eigenvector ) or that this state experiences significant discretization effects .",
