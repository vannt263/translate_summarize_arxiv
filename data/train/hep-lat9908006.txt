    "<S> experiments with imaginary chemical potential and glasgow method carried out in two interrelated models  four dimensional qcd in the infinite coupling limit , and one dimensional qcd  support the point of view expressed by the title .    </S>",
    "<S> -1 cm    the profound differences of dense , cold matter , and hot , moderately dense , hadron gas might be reflected by different performances of numerical approaches to finite density qcd . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the enhancement of the fluctuations near @xmath0 should give better chances either to the glasgow method @xcite , by ameliorating the overlap problem , and to the imaginary chemical potential@xcite , which does not systematically bias the ensemble and thus needs large response to infinitesimal @xmath1 changes near @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of baryons are measured by the baryon number susceptibility @xmath3 lattice results @xcite indicate the range where @xmath4 is significantly different from zero : this is the candidate region for performing finite density calculations below @xmath0  a narrow , but not minuscule interval .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath5 ( we shall explicit only the @xmath1 dependence ) is an even function of @xmath1 , we have : @xmath6 where @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> consider @xmath9 a fourth order polynomial describes the data where @xmath10 and @xmath11 do not depend on @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling limit of qcd displays confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , and , besides having produced interesting , semiqualitative results on the phase diagram , offers a nice test bed for numerical methods .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the effective potential @xmath12 ( related to @xmath13 as @xmath14 ) in the @xmath15 limit of qcd @xcite : @xmath16 /sinh(n_t </S>",
    "<S> \\lambda ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variational parameter @xmath17 ( essentially , @xmath18 ) is to be determined by a minimum condition , @xmath19 is the number of points in time direction , @xmath20 the number of colors ( which we fix : @xmath21 ) , r the asymmetry factor @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the inverse temperature . </S>",
    "<S> note that formally @xmath24 is an one dimensional partition function which `` remembers '' its four dimensional origin via @xmath17 .    for a purely imaginary chemical potential , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we see the expected periodicity @xmath26 , and we note that the chemical potential term can be ignored for large @xmath19 ( zero temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have verified that in this limit any dependence on the chemical potential is lost @xcite , fig.1 : at @xmath27 @xmath18 as a function of ( complex ) @xmath1 is a constant in the half plane @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the ( real ) critical chemical potential . by increasing the temperature , the effective potential changes with imaginary @xmath1 , and the chiral condensate _ increases _ with imaginary chemical potential , as it should . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , where we plot the chiral condensate as a function of a real , and a purely imaginary @xmath1 rather close to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the fourth order polynomial behaviour anticipated above holds in a rather large range of chemical potential , and that a simple second order polinomial works fine as well .    in the same hot region </S>",
    "<S> reweighting too might prove useful . to check that </S>",
    "<S> , we have tested the glasgow method in one dimensional qcd@xcite , a solvable model without ssb , but with baryons , whose partition function is formally identical to the effective potential above . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial difference comes from the meaning of the parameter @xmath17 which here is simply @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the bare mass @xmath31 plays the rle of an explicit breaking term , and @xmath32 when @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> fixing @xmath21 , the relevant parameter is @xmath34 , which is the analogous of an inverse temperature .    at large `` temperature '' ( small @xmath34 ) </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that the glasgow method reproduces the exact results @xcite , thus supporting the idea that reweighting methods can be successfully used in that regime . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that this is a non trivial results since at large temperature quenched and exact results are distinct @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the low temperature regime of the same model , where the quenched approximation is apparently exact , and the success of the glasgow method is then guaranteed a priori ( as the glasgow method reproduces the quenched results for small statistics ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the zeros of the determinant , which control the singularities of the quenched model , and those of the partition function , the lee yang zeros controlling the singularities of the full model , in the complex plane @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath36 zeros can be easily calculated using the results of @xcite and are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the glasgow method ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) reproduces them correctly , as expected given that @xmath13 itself approaches the correct value as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the smoothening of the transition in the full model noted in @xcite can be clearly read off figs . 3 , 4 : the zeros of @xmath13 move away from the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed , however , that in this case there is no pathological onset ( no goldstone particle here ! ) : the glasgow method only needs rearranging zeros on circular patterns . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to hope that the same happens in high temperature , four dimensional qcd . from fig </S>",
    "<S> 3 we also understand why the quenched approximation is apparently working on long lattices @xcite : the zeros will become dense on the same circle where the zeros of the determinant are randomly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> an important difference between the full and quenched transition however remains : only the zeros of the partition functions are fixed by symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> hence , only the nearest zero of z ( and not that of the determinant ) has a calculable distance from the real axes @xmath37 , fulfilling a lee - yang  like scaling towards the @xmath38 singularity .    </S>",
    "<S> we have given examples of clear signals obtained by use of an imaginary chemical potential , and successful calculations with the glasgow method in toy models related with qcd . we have suggested a possible simple line of analysis which combines and cross checks results from both approaches . </S>"
