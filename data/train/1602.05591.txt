    "tridiagonal matrices naturally emerge in various fields of mathematics , physics and other sciences .",
    "we shall prove a theorem relating the spectra of tridiagonal matrices with opposite elements on their diagonals .",
    "motivation for this study comes from quantum mechanics .",
    "stationary problems of quantum mechanics , typically , fall into one of the two large categories : the problems are either exactly solvable ( so the spectrum and the wave functions can be found analytically ) or are unsolvable by analytical means .",
    "however , in the late 1980-s an intermediate class of problems was discovered    the quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) problems  @xcite .",
    "these settings permit analytic derivation of a finite part of the ( generally , infinite ) spectrum , by partial reducing of the hamiltonian to a block - diagonal form .    in  @xcite ,",
    "two dual qes periodic potentials were considered , whose spectra interchange under the switch @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy . in the self - dual case ,",
    "when the two potentials are equal to each other , the spectrum transforms into itself under the said switch .    in  @xcite , it was noticed that @xmath2_the algebraic ( i.e. , analytically derivable ) part_@xmath2 of the spectrum of a sextic qes potential transforms into itself under the switch @xmath3 . in this ,",
    "restricted sense , such a potential can be regarded self - dual .",
    "accordingly , it is natural to hypothesise that there also exist dual sextic potentials whose algebraic parts of spectra interchange under @xmath0 .",
    "here we discuss such potentials and demonstrate the symmetry of their spectra , using a theorem proven in section  [ section_1 ] .",
    "in addition to this , we present an independent , quantum - mechanical proof of the mentioned symmetry of the spectra .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be tridiagonal matrices : @xmath6    then their determinants , in the case of an odd and even @xmath7 , are related , correspondingly , as : @xmath8    ( by induction ) for @xmath9 , the two above formulae are straightforward : @xmath10 now assume the fulfilment of the formulae ( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath11 .",
    "then , for @xmath12 , one has : @xmath13 and , similarly : @xmath14    aside from the rigorous proof , we can guess the above result via qualitative reasoning .",
    "the determinant of the matrix is , generally , a sum of @xmath15 terms , each of which contains , at most , one multiplier @xmath16 for each @xmath17 .",
    "if the overall power of @xmath16 s in each term is odd ( even ) , the determinant will ( not ) change the sign as we flip the signs of all @xmath16 s .",
    "this is exactly the case of tridiagonal matrices of an odd ( even ) size .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be the characteristic polynomials of the tridiagonal matrices introduced in  : @xmath20 then : @xmath21    the proof ensues immediately from the previous lemma , if one substitutes : @xmath22    one can formulate our result in a slightly different way :    if two tridiagonal matrices differ only by signs of their diagonal elements , then the sets of their eigenvalues can be obtained from one another by sign inversion .    indeed , the previous theorem states that the eigenvalues of @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be found from the characteristic equations @xmath25    the following circumstance is worth noting .",
    "suppose one has managed to derive the closed - form expressions for the roots of the @xmath26 : @xmath27 generally , the individual roots will not simply change their signs under the change of the signs of @xmath16 : @xmath28 however , the roots will change the sign as a set : @xmath29",
    "this section explains the motivation for the above result , and presents an instructive example of employment of the theorem to some problems of quantum mechanics .",
    "a wide range of classical systems with one degree of freedom can be described in the language of the hamilton formalism .",
    "the equations of motion for such systems are :    @xmath30    @xmath31    with the hamiltonian taking the form of @xmath32 as ever in the case of time - independent hamiltonians , the value @xmath33 of this hamiltonian is conserved ( and is termed the energy ) . from the latter equation",
    ", the canonical momentum can be written down as ( below we shall use @xmath34 ) : @xmath35    the process of quantisation of a classical system can be thought of as replacing the classical position and momentum by operators obeying the canonical commutation relations : @xmath36 = { { i\\mkern1mu}}\\,\\hbar \\quad,\\ ] ] and acting on the wave vectors ascribed to the states of a quantum system .",
    "oftentimes , the so - called position representation is used : @xmath37 with the wave vectors implemented as functions of @xmath38 .",
    "after the quantisation , the hamiltonian becomes an operator , and the latter equality turns into a differential equation named after erwin schrdinger : @xmath39 \\ , \\psi \\,(x ) = e \\ , \\psi \\,(x ) \\quad.\\label{sch}\\ ] ] to know the permissible energies , we need to find the spectrum of the differential operator @xmath40 . for bound states ,",
    "the spectrum turns out to be discrete .",
    "these quantum states correspond to periodic motion in the classical system .",
    "this is the only type of motion available for a potentials that become infinite at @xmath41 . for such motion ,",
    "the process of solving the schrdinger equation gets reduced to diagonalisation of a matrix of a countable but ( generally ) infinite size .",
    "there are few well - known _ exactly solvable _ problems , for which the entire matrix can be diagonalised . in general",
    ", this kind of problem can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , there exist so - called _ quasi - exactly solvable _ ( qes ) problems , ones permitting partial algebraisation.@xmath2 in these problems , the matrix of the hamiltonian permits to single out a block of a finite size    which reduces the search of a limited number of energy levels to diagonalisation of a finite - sized matrix .",
    "the most well - known examples of qes problems are the even and odd sixth - order polynomial potentials :     @xmath42\\,x^2 - \\mu\\left(j+\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right ) \\quad,\\vspace{2 mm }      \\label{even}\\\\      v_{\\text{odd}}\\,(\\nu,\\,\\mu,\\,j,\\,x ) = \\dfrac{\\nu^2}{8}\\,x^6 + \\dfrac{\\mu\\,\\nu}{4 } \\ , x^4 + \\left [   \\dfrac{\\mu^2}{8 } - 2 \\ , \\nu\\ , \\left ( j + \\dfrac{5}{8 } \\right)\\right]\\,x^2   - \\mu\\left(j+\\dfrac{3}{4}\\right)\\quad,\\vspace{4 mm }      \\label{odd}\\\\      \\nonumber      \\nu \\in \\mathbb{r}^+,\\quad,\\qquad \\mu \\in \\mathbb{r } \\quad,\\qquad      j = 1/2,\\ , 1,\\ , 3/2,\\ , 2,\\,\\ldots\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    [ v ]    these potentials are even and odd in the following sense . for them , the first @xmath43 lowest even ( odd ) energy levels can be obtained through diagonalisation of the following tridiagonal matrices :    @xmath44    this is owing to the fact that , after an eigenvalues - preserving quasi - gauge transformation,@xmath2[multiblock footnote omitted ] the hamiltonians corresponding to potentials   can be written as :    @xmath45    [ ht ]    where the operators @xmath46 obey the commutation relation : @xmath47 = 2t^0\\quad,\\qquad [ t^+,t^0 ] = -t^+\\quad,\\qquad[t^-,t^0 ] = t^-\\quad\\ ] ] and therefore can be interpreted as the generators of a representation of the @xmath48 group , with @xmath49 being the spin and @xmath50 the representation dimension . that the energies obtained through these means are the lowest ones of a given parity of the potential    that is warranted by the oscillation theorem  @xcite and by the fact that eigenfunctions of the operators   are polynomials in @xmath51 of powers from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "( for an odd potential , an additional multiplier of @xmath54 comes from the quasi - gauge transformation , see  @xcite@xmath2 ) .    for brevity",
    ", we introduce the notation    @xmath55    the potentials with opposite values of the parameter @xmath56 possess the duality property :    @xmath57    if one sets  @xmath58 , this becomes the self - duality :    @xmath59    effectively , it means that the motion in the potential @xmath60 can be considered as motion in @xmath61 along the imaginary direction .",
    "for this reason , we will treat @xmath38 as a complex variable .    in  @xcite",
    ", it was noticed that the algebraic parts of the spectra of potentials @xmath62 and @xmath63 are symmetric under the switch @xmath3 . with the use of the theorem proven in section  [ section_1 ] , it becomes straightforward from the equation   that this symmetry can be generalised to non - zero values of @xmath56 . in other words ,",
    "the energies in the algebraic sector of the potentials change their signs under @xmath64 :    @xmath65    [ symmy ]    here @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the highest energy levels in the algebraic sectors of the potentials :    @xmath68      in this section , we provide an independent proof of the energy spectrum reflection symmetry  .",
    "this proof will be purely quantum - mechanical , and will not rely on the algebraisation property   of the potentials .",
    "the section is largely based on the ideas proposed in  @xcite .    to solve the schrdinger equation  , it is often convenient to change variables : @xmath69",
    "then the function @xmath70 satisfies the ricatti equation : @xmath71 in the limit @xmath72 , the function @xmath73 becomes the classical momentum  .",
    "so we shall name it the quantum momentum function ( qmf ) , and shall introduce the notation @xmath74 in terms whereof the equation   will become @xmath75    the quantisation condition determining the @xmath7-th energy level is normally obtained from the requirement of single - valuedness of the function @xmath76 . however , in  @xcite a more interesting option was proposed .",
    "it was based on the fact that the wave function corresponding to the @xmath7-th energy level has @xmath7 zeros on the real axis , between the classical turning points ( these points being the zeros of the classical momentum )  @xcite .    in these zeroes ,",
    "the qmf has poles .",
    "indeed , it trivially follows from ( [ ch ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) that @xmath77 for analytic potentials , the pole of the function @xmath78 is of the first order , and the residue at this pole is @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the integral of the qmf along the contour @xmath80 enclosing classical turning points is : @xmath81 where the contour @xmath80 should be close enough to the real axis , in order to avoid containing the poles and branch cuts of @xmath78 , that are off the real axis .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath82 .    in the classical limit ( @xmath72 ) , the series of poles inside @xmath80 coalesces into a branch cut of the classical momentum .",
    "the classical momentum is set positive along the bottom of the branch cut , in order for the classical action to stay positive when the direction of the contour in   is chosen to be counter - clockwise .",
    "the subsequent discussion being applicable to both potentials presented in the equation ( [ v ] ) , we shall concentrate on the even potential , equation ( [ even ] ) . assume for the time being that the potential @xmath61 is of a double - well shape ( which is true for a wide range of the parameters ) , and that the equation @xmath83 has four solutions .",
    "in this case , the equation   reads as : @xmath84    .,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    where the contours are defined as in figure [ roots6 ] .    from the equation",
    ", it follows that the duality property for the qmf has form : @xmath85 it allows us to calculate the lhs of the   for the positive energy levels of the potential @xmath60 as an integral of @xmath86 along the imaginary axis : @xmath87 the sum of the integrals of @xmath88 over the contours @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is equal to an integral over the large contour @xmath92 enclosing _",
    "_ all _ _ has no poles other than those inside the contours @xmath89 , @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , as was demonstrated in  @xcite , the poles of the qmf emerge only on the branch lines of the classical momentum , which in our case are the segments of the real and imaginary axes , enclosed by @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "] the poles of @xmath88 .",
    "the latter integral can be evaluated with aid of the residue of @xmath93 at infinity : @xmath94 here we assume the point @xmath95 to be an isolated singularity , which is indeed the case for the considered qes potential , as was demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the equality ( [ 36 ] ) establishes a relation between the quantisation condition for a system described by the potential @xmath61 , with the energy set negative , and the quantisation condition for a system described by @xmath60 , with the energy set positive . in other words , starting from  , we can _ derive _ the quantisation condition in the form   for @xmath60 .    to calculate the residue at infinity",
    ", we introduce the variable @xmath96 :    @xmath97    in terms whereof the ricatti equation   assumes the shape : @xmath98 the laurent expansion for @xmath99 reads as @xmath100 the lowest power of @xmath96 is determined by the highest power of @xmath38 in @xmath101 in  . substituting the above expansion into the integral ( [ 36 ] )",
    "gives : @xmath102 where the contour @xmath103 encloses the origin in the complex @xmath96-plane .",
    "to find @xmath104 , we insert the laurent series   in the ricatti equation   and match the coefficients of the five lowest powers of @xmath96 : @xmath105 the two sets of solutions are : @xmath106 following  @xcite , we employ the condition of square integrability of the wave function @xmath107\\quad.\\ ] ] for large @xmath38 ( and small @xmath96 ) one gets : @xmath108 \\quad,\\ ] ] and one has to choose the second set of solution with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this yields : @xmath111 or , equivalently : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the number of the highest energy level in the algebraic sector . moving the first integral , with an opposite sign , from the lhs to the rhs , and then using the equality  , one arrives at @xmath114 from looking at the formulae   and  , one may misconclude that the @xmath115-th energy level of the potential @xmath61 is symmetric to the @xmath116-th energy level of @xmath60 .",
    "this , however , would be a mistake .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between the energies above the relative maximum of the potential , which we for now assume to be at @xmath117 , and those below . in the former case",
    ", the equation   has a single solution for the energy , while in the latter    two solutions : @xmath118    we intend to comply with a standard convention wherein ( a ) the notation @xmath119 stands for the @xmath7-th energy level from the bottom , and ( b ) the bottom level corresponds to @xmath120 . to that end ,",
    "the energy levels below @xmath121 should be enumerated as : strictly speaking , does not cover all the possibilities .",
    "a situation may emerge , wherein the highest level below @xmath121 is @xmath122 , and it lacks a counterpart @xmath123 .",
    "nonetheless , in this case the proper numbering is @xmath124 , as is  . ]",
    "@xmath125 now we see that @xmath126 in the equation   is the number of the even energy level , @xmath127 . in other words , for an even @xmath7 , the @xmath7-th energy level is symmetric to the @xmath128-th energy level : @xmath129    it is worth noting that the energies @xmath130 and @xmath131 share a perturbative part and differ only due to the non - perturbative splitting called into being by the tunneling effects .",
    "these effects get smaller near the bottom of the wells , and become strong closer to the maximum . at the perturbative level ( in neglect of the splitting ) , one can say that the level @xmath132 is symmetric to two levels : @xmath119 and @xmath133 .",
    "for the odd potential  , integrating @xmath134 over the contour @xmath135 furnishes : @xmath136 where the number of the highest energy level in the algebraic sector is now given by : @xmath137 then , starting again with  , we arrive at : @xmath138 be mindful that in the case of the odd potential , one chooses @xmath139 when solving  .",
    "therefrom , the energy spectrum reflection reads : @xmath140    0.45        0.45     as was already mentioned , the potentials @xmath61 and @xmath141 do not necessarily have a double - well form . depending on the values of the parameters , they may have one , two or three minima . however , it turns out that for the energies in the algebraic sector the integration contours always look as in figures [ roots6 ] and [ roots62 ] .",
    "the more surprising is that our result obtained by heavy - duty tools of quantum mechanics could have been proven in one line by using the theorem from section [ section_1 ] , as we have explained in the end of section [ section21 ] .",
    "this example from quantum mechanics serves as a strong motivation to study the analytic properties of the potentials and the generalised wkb quantisation condition . for example",
    ", it turns out that the symmetry of the quantum energy levels has classical origins  @xcite .",
