    "there has been some debate over the origins of the so - called  compact ellipticals \" .",
    "these belong to an apparently rare morphological type , exemplified by m32 , which has a very small effective radius ( @xmath2 few hundred parsecs ) and high central surface brightness @xcite .",
    "there are only a handful of classical ces , those which have been known for some decades .",
    "in addition to m32 - a very close satellite of m31 - the other  classical \" ces , ngc 4486b and ngc 5846a , also occur close to massive galaxies in groups or clusters .",
    "they are , therefore , generally suspected to be the result of tidal stripping and truncation driven by interactions with their giant neighbours @xcite .",
    "however , an alternative view suggests that they are the low - luminosity end of the family of normal elliptical galaxies , in which the high surface brightness is the result of earlier star formation caused by dissipative ( wet ) mergers @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen the discovery of a number of ces , including two in the massive galaxy cluster abell 1689 @xcite , another in the halo of the cd galaxy of abell 496 @xcite , a sister to the classical ce in the ngc 5846 group @xcite and earlier noted in @xcite , two in the antlia cluster @xcite , and three ces in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the evidence for stripping as a mechanism to form ces is compelling but frequently indirect .",
    "for example , they are often found to have metallicities and velocity dispersions appropriate to more massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite found evidence that ngc 4486b possesses a central massive black hole .",
    "it has a mass well above the relation between the black hole mass and bulge luminosity found for other galaxies , consistent with a more massive progenitor .",
    "other evidence indicates the probable hubble type of any progenitor .",
    "for example , surface brightness profiles obtained from high quality imaging ( such as that available with hst ) are best fit by a two component model , indicating that we are seeing the remnant of a disk @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggests that m32 itself still retains a disk component .",
    "furthermore , the gas from which the stars in m32 formed is similar to that of the galactic disk , and unlike the rapid enrichment found in classical elliptical galaxies , consistent with the threshed spiral scenario @xcite",
    ".    direct evidence of stripping occurring is less forthcoming .",
    "suggestions of tidal features have been reported in m32 @xcite , but they are difficult to identify as m32 lies close to the line of sight to m31 , and the disk of m31 makes accurate photometry difficult . more recently ,",
    "both @xcite and @xcite report a ce exhibiting a possible tidal feature , but these features are faint and rather uncertain , again due to the high surface brightness of their immediate environments .    a number of dwarf galaxies exhibiting strong tidal features have been found , but these lie at the low luminosity end of typical early - type galaxies ( having effective radii of @xmath21 kpc ) rather than being compact ellipticals .",
    "for example , @xcite describe the serendipitous discovery of a dwarf ( m@xmath3= -16.0 mags , @xmath4 = 930 pc ) being stripped by a more massive neighbour .",
    "another has been found in subaru data @xcite which also has an effective radius of @xmath21 kpc , but is somewhat more luminous , with an m@xmath3 of -17.7 mags .",
    "tidal debris has also been seen near massive galaxies , but with no clear evidence of any progenitor , as presumably it has been totally disrupted @xcite .",
    "the lack of any clear examples of ces being formed by stripping is not totally unexpected , due to the very short timescale @xcite expected from the stripping scenario ( less than a few gyr ) .",
    "however , identifying a number of ces which exhibit ongoing tidal stripping would not only show that a formation channel via tidal stripping does occur , but also allow us to study the process in more detail .",
    "equally , examples of very isolated ces , in which stripping is not a likely formation channel would be significant , as it would suggest that ces can form by other means , and their location close to massive galaxies may not be a direct cause of their morphology .",
    "hence we have undertaken a search for further ce candidates from the full sdss dr7 spectroscopic sample , which embraces galaxy cluster , group and field regions , with the aim of finding examples that might address these issues .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : spectral ]    @xmath5{spheroidals_mu_b_re_kpc_new.ps } & \\includegraphics[angle=90,width=87mm]{spheroidals_m_b_sigma_new.ps } \\end{array}$ ]        the host of ce1(cgcg 241 - 068 ) was best fit by galfit using three components , all of which had a srsic n of @xmath24 , and a range of effective radii .",
    "it was this fit that was used to subtract the host for the galfit fit to the ce .",
    "however , a single component with an n of 5.47 gave a good fit , consistent with the host being a classical elliptical galaxy .",
    "ce1 is in the @xcite catalogue of compact groups ( group number 127 ) . in this catalogue , which only lists four members in the group ,",
    "the host is the only absorption line galaxy the others also having emission features .",
    "it is also in the group u349 from @xcite , which contains an additional two members .",
    "the majority of the galaxies in the @xcite group remain late types , with the ce host being the only clear massive elliptical galaxy .",
    "it is notable that @xmath22 arcmin ( about 55 kpc in projected distance ) north of ce1 there is a more massive galaxy ( pgc 033427 ) , whose image is also showing strong signs of being stripped by cgcg 241 - 068 ( the host of ce1 ) .",
    "that is , this ce host is not only currently stripping two other galaxies , but has most likely had some previous history of merging activity to obtain its current early - type morphology .",
    "in the standard hierarchical model of galaxy formation massive ellipticals are the result of mergers .",
    "although megacam imaging is used to study the dwarf galaxy , the r and i - band images are so deep that the host galaxy ( ii zw 097 ) is saturated in its central regions .",
    "therefore we employ the sdss data to study it .",
    "the galfit fit to the sdss r - band image gives a minimal residual with a two srsic and central psf fit to a nuclear component .",
    "the inner srsic component has an effective radius of @xmath21 kpc . ,",
    "and the b / t ratio is @xmath20.5 .",
    "the outer component has a low srsic n of 0.45 and a effective radius of 5.5 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with a s0/a type galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is hard to say much about the environment of ce2 as it lies only 1 @xmath6 ( @xmath230 kpc ) from the edge of the sdss dr7 survey area .",
    "the sdss image does not go further south than the ce , but to the north of its position the sdss database gives a further four galaxies at this redshift range , all of which are late type .",
    "it also gives a galaxy , visible in the megacam imaging ( but not the sdss images ) as a disk galaxy , at the same redshift as ce2 , and at a projected distance of @xmath2300 kpc .",
    "all of these for which spectra are available show evidence of strong emission .",
    "ce2 is also near a @xcite group ( u834 ) both on the sky and in redshift .",
    "this group has only three listed members , the closest of which is @xmath238 arcmin from iii zw 097 , or 1.1 mpc .",
    "this is sufficiently far that the ce2 system is described as isolated in @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic data further shows that the early type galaxies nearby on the sky are members of a background galaxy cluster at a redshift of @xmath20.1 , and so not associated with the group .",
    "the large spiral fraction of these groups is not unexpected , as they are relatively small possessing only a handful of galaxies .",
    "however , it is notable that the two ces each are close to an early - type host galaxy .",
    "one notable feature of both ce galaxies is the environments in which they are found  relatively small groups . at first sight",
    "this is surprising , as stripping was expected to be found in galaxy clusters for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , previous searches in small group environments , such as the leo group @xcite , had proved unsuccessful , with candidates being shown not to be ces . and secondly , many had argued that the dense environments of galaxy clusters were the best location to find ces ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence many recent searches have focussed on galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the new ces presented here , however , show that ces can form in small groups .",
    "however , this should not be surprising as the prototype ce , m32 , is in our own local group , which only comprises a few luminous late - type galaxies ( mw , m31 and m33 ) .",
    "an outstanding question is whether ce1 and ce2 are more representative of ces than those that have been found previously in galaxy clusters , or whether they are unusual ( in being located in small groups and exhibiting tidal features ) but simply easier to detect .",
    "we may only be seeing a result of a number of effects .",
    "firstly , there are considerably more galaxies in groups than in clusters @xcite , so one would expect to see instances in groups given a search of a wide - field survey such as sdss dr7 .",
    "secondly , the crowded nature of galaxy clusters may reduce the time that a stream is visible as associated with its satellite galaxy .",
    "simulations @xcite show that early in a galaxy cluster s life , when the majority of the galaxies are found in smaller groups that have yet to merge into the final single cluster , stream production dominates the formation of the intracluster light ( icl ) .",
    "later , the heating of the stellar material in galaxies in the cluster , and the complex tidal field , mean that streams are rapidly dissolved .",
    "finally there may be much background light from the cluster members and its icl , making the identification of streams , if present , more difficult .",
    "the less harsh smaller group environments are thus ideal to detect stripping and also to study the details of the stripping process .",
    "however , the presence of the two new ces in groups could be a real effect , and there may be a preference for ces to form in group rather than cluster environments . although the overall tidal field may be less in a group than a cluster , the lower relative velocities of the galaxies within a group allow time for stripping to have an effect .",
    "this scenario would be consistent with the notion of  pre - processing \" , in which much more of the transformation of galaxies , than hitherto expected , occurs when they are in groups and not in any subsequent cluster environment .",
    "preprocessing has been proposed to explain a number of recent observations .",
    "for example , @xcite conclude that group or subgroup environments are the main sites of s0 formation , and that minor mergers , harassment and tidal interactions are the most likely mechanisms .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that a simple threshing model for ucds @xcite within a galaxy cluster potential failed , in that it produced insufficient ucds at large cluster - centric radii , compared to the data from the fornax cluster .",
    "but they suggest that this may be due to the ucds having been formed in sub - groups that later fell into , and became , fornax .",
    "@xcite find that the four individual groups being assembled into the galaxy cluster sg 1120 - 1202 have early - type galaxy ( etg ) fractions consistent with pre - processing occurring .",
    "indeed they argue that it plays a dominant role in establishing the etg fraction of galaxy clusters .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by @xcite from a study of a large sample of galaxies from sdss .",
    "it was noted above that the groups containing our ces have a large spiral fraction , indicating that the environment is unevolved , even when compared to other galaxy groups .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the youth of the group allows one to see the initial stages of ce formation , signatures which will be erased in a couple of gyr or so , and hence not visible in older , more evolved , groups .",
    "many ces have now been found @xcite , but none of these exhibit strong tidal features such as seen above , although there are hints of halos and or other more diffuse features .",
    "it may be that these compact galaxies formed in groups before they assembled into a massive galaxy cluster .",
    "this might explain the old ages of the ces found in galaxy clusters @xcite , which may have been transformed into ces many gyr ago , prior to assembly in the cluster .",
    "the progenitors for the two ces were almost certainly disk galaxies , as computer simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that discs are required to get tidal tails .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that the teardrop morphology , similar to that seen in ce2 , is best explained by a rotating disk in the dwarf galaxy , and occurs , in their model , at @xmath2 1gyr after initial impact of the dwarf on the host galaxy .",
    "indeed , the arm and loops are only formed from the disk components , and these also have longer lifetimes ( @xmath21 gyr , up to 3 gyr for the less strong features ) than the much weaker features ( typically broad fans ) from elliptical - elliptical interactions . other n - body simulations @xcite further show that the stripping of a disc galaxy can specifically lead to ce galaxies . with ce1 and ce2",
    ", we have direct evidence of this process occurring .    in essence , the ces are the bulges of the progenitor disc galaxies .",
    "they can be understood as essentially naked bulges , sharing most of the properties of the bulges of their progenitors , although some changes are expected from the interaction .",
    "a focus on a bulge origin for the bulk of these galaxies is important , allowing us to interpret the location of ces with respect to the kormendy relation and the faber - jackson relation ( see figure [ fi : plots ] ) . in these plots ,",
    "they sit in the regions occupied by bulges , and no longer appear to be so unusual .",
    "both ce1 and ce2 possess ssp equivalent ages that are relatively young compared to the majority of elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is notable that the presence of a younger stellar population makes the new ces somewhat more akin to the the template ce ( m32 ) than others reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite give a spectroscopic age for m32 of between 2.0 and 3.5 gyr , compared to ssp ages of @xmath25.4 gyr for ce1 and ce2 , whereas @xcite find that none of their ces exhibits a young stellar population , and the majority are old ( @xmath79 gyr ) .",
    "ce1 and ce2 are , however , not unlike the @xcite galaxy noted earlier .",
    "it has broad - band colours of b - v=0.34 , and ( v - i ) = 0.5 , and these blue colours suggested to them that a population of young stars is present .",
    "stellar population models gave a mean [ fe / h ] of -0.7 , and a luminosity - weighted age of 2 @xmath8 1 gyr .    in the case of m32",
    ", @xcite analysed high s / n spectra and found both an ancient and an intermediate - age population , with the latter being more concentrated in the nuclear region .",
    "this is consistent with the stripping model in which the starburst is caused by gas inflow to the centre of the smaller galaxy . for @xcite",
    "found that , in their simulation of the formation of m32 by stripping , rapid gas inflow towards the central regions of the dwarf occurs , giving rise to efficient star formation .",
    "one might expect star formation to be triggered by the gravitational interaction .",
    "@xcite investigated minor galaxy interaction in sdss dr5 .",
    "they find that the minor partner in the interaction frequently suffers triggered star formation , and that , as expected , the gas - rich galaxies experience this more",
    ". however , it is also consistent with the view of @xcite in which a starburst results from a recent merger that formed m32 .",
    "it is the clear visual evidence of tidal streams that shows the stripping model to the be correct one for our ces .",
    "we have presented two newly discovered compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxies , which show clear evidence for ongoing tidal stripping , and are being transformed from progenitor disk galaxies .",
    "these galaxies show that tidal stripping is one channel for the formation of compact ellipticals  although it does not exclude the possibility of other channels being available .",
    "both the new ces have a younger stellar population than most etgs , likely triggered by the tidal interactions .",
    "we previously have found circumstantial evidence of stripping from the metallicity and velocity dispersions of recently discovered compact galaxies in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "for the first time we see , in the galaxies presented here , direct evidence for this process and do not need to rely on the indirect evidence of galaxy properties lying off the scaling relations for spheroidal stellar systems    both are also in relatively sparse environments , in small groups .",
    "it is also notable that the hosts of the ces are the only early - type galaxy in their local environments , although no immediate explanation for this presents itself .",
    "the two new ces are much like the prototype ce , m32 .",
    "they share many of its properties , including a young stellar population , and being located in a low density group . in the case of ce2 ,",
    "its small size and environment make it more akin to m32 than the other ces in the literature .",
    "it is valuable to have such examples of the process of tidal stripping of discs .",
    "not only do they allow detailed study of the process of ce formation , but also stripping is believed to be an important channel for the formation of other types of galaxy in addition to ces , such as ucds @xcite , and des @xcite .",
    "follow - up studies of these new ces will allow a better understanding of some of the details of the process , and the environments in which it occurs .",
    "aph would like to acknowledge the generosity of the leverhulme trust , during the course of whose grant this work was undertaken .",
