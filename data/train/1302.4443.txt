    "over the last few years , many stars with exoplanets have been found to have high obliquities , i.e. , large angles between the stellar equator and the planet s orbital plane ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , for practical reasons almost all of the measurements have been made for stars with hot jupiters .",
    "systems with smaller planets , longer - period planets , and multiple planets remain relatively unexplored .    for the hot jupiters , @xcite and @xcite found evidence that the obliquities of many systems have been affected by tidal evolution : the systems for which one would expect planet - star tidal interactions to be strongest",
    "are preferentially found to have low obliquities .",
    "systems with weaker tides have a more random obliquity distribution .",
    "this suggests that at the time of hot jupiter formation , before tides had any opportunity to act , the orbital planes were only loosely correlated with the equatorial planes of their host stars .",
    "this in turn provides evidence that whatever `` migration '' process produces hot jupiters also causes their orbits to be tilted away from the initial plane of formation , favoring scenarios such as planet - planet scattering or the kozai effect over the once dominant paradigm of gradual inspiral within the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the interpretation of the hot - jupiter results is not settled , though , because the possibility remains that high obliquities are a generic feature of planetary systems , not specific to hot jupiter migration .",
    "there are several proposed mechanisms for tilting a star relative to its protoplanetary disk : chaotic star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic star - disk interactions @xcite , torques due to internal gravity waves @xcite , and torques due to neighboring stars @xcite . in these scenarios , we should observe high obliquities not only in hot - jupiter systems but also in a broader class of planetary systems .",
    "one may test this idea by measuring stellar obliquities in systems with multiple transiting planets . in such systems",
    "the planets orbits are likely to be coplanar , and presumably mark the plane of the protoplanetary disk out of which the planets originally formed .",
    "if these systems have low stellar obliquities as a rule , then the high obliquities in hot - jupiter systems are probably due to planet migration .",
    "if instead the obliquity distribution of multiple - transiting systems is similar to that of hot - jupiter systems , then the obliquities are clues to more general processes in star and planet formation , and not specific to hot jupiters .",
    "the first multiple - transiting system for which the projected obliquity was measured was kepler-30 @xcite .",
    "the authors took advantage of _ kepler _ photometry and the occurrence of star - spots to measure the projected obliquity .",
    "more recently @xcite measured the projected obliquity in koi-94 making use of the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , and @xcite constrained the obliquities of kepler-50 and kepler-65 using asteroseismology .",

    "we allowed ( @xmath42 ) to be adjusted , with prior constraint centered on the tabulated value of @xmath43 and with a gaussian width of @xmath44 .",
    "the difference between the two parameters ( @xmath45 ) was held fixed at the tabulated value of @xmath46 since the difference is only weakly constrained by the data and in turn has little effect on the other parameters .",

    "this spectroscopic modeling code is described by @xcite .",
    "our confidence interval for this prior was enlarged to @xmath47  kms@xmath7 , because the value measured from the broadening of stellar absorption lines might not be fully representative for the projected rotation speed of the stellar surface area covered during transit .",
    "for example depending on the impact parameter , differential rotation might lead to such a mismatch .",

    "this is because sme uses its own estimate of the @xmath48 when extracting from the line width .",
    "we tested if using the different priors makes a material difference , which is not the case . ]    to isolate the rm signal one must subtract ( or model simultaneously ) the orbital rv variation .",
    "one possibility is to subtract a model of the orbital rv variation based on the rv semiamplitude ( @xmath50 ) obtained by @xcite , which was based on rvs obtained sporadically over several months .",
    "we did not choose this approach out of concern that apparent rv variation due to starspots or other astrophysical noise can depend strongly on timescale .",
    "starspot - induced signals , for example , can introduce slow drifts in the measured rv signal on a particular night .",
    "such a signal would be averaged out in a data set obtained over many stellar rotation periods .",
    "see @xcite for examples of this effect and how it can influence measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently we did not apply a prior constraint on @xmath50 or on the systemic velocity @xmath51 in our analysis .    for the estimation of the uncertainty intervals",

    "[ fig : koi244_show ] ) .",
    "because of this and because there is a hint of a prograde signal in the rvs ( figure  [ fig : koi244_rv_results ] ) the low projected obliquity is favored .    in more detail",
    ": we know from the _ kepler _ photometry that planet c has a high impact parameter , i.e. , it travels near the stellar limb throughout the transit .",
    "we also know _ a priori _ that the star has a substantial projected rotation speed from the sme analysis .",
    "combining these two pieces of information we know there is no way to make the rm effect vanish . figure  [ fig : koi244_rv_results ] illustrates that we did not make a high - s / n detection of the rm effect .",
    "we might therefore ask which values of @xmath0 would lead to the smallest rm amplitude , or an rm signal which would be easiest to hide by adjusting other parameters in our model .",
    "we have just noted that the maximum amplitude of the rm effect is larger for @xmath133 near @xmath134 than for @xmath0 near @xmath131 or @xmath132 ( figure  [ fig : koi244_show ] ) .",
    "this is because limb darkening attenuates the signal by a factor of @xmath135 for a star like kepler-25 .",
    "the rm signal has maxima when the planet crosses the stellar limb where limb darkening is strongest , and the signal is zero near mid - transit where limb darkening is weakest .",
    "for @xmath133 near @xmath136 degrees the maximum rm signal occurs nearer to the center of the stellar disk .",
    "in addition , the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath50 ( the out - of - transit slope ) are most strongly covariant with @xmath0 when @xmath0 is near @xmath131 or @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "this is because of the time - antisymmetry of the rm signal in such cases .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath0 near @xmath137 the rm signal is time - symmetric .",
    "finally , differential rotation would also weaken the rm signal for @xmath138 or @xmath132 compared to the @xmath139 signal , though this is a comparatively minor effect ( @xmath140% ) .",
    "together these factors make it easier to hide an rm signal with @xmath141 ( or @xmath142 ) than @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to infer that @xmath0 must be near @xmath131 or @xmath132 with a sufficiently constraining upper limit on the amplitude of the rm effect . here",
    "the data prefer @xmath131 over @xmath132 as there is a hint of a prograde rm signal in the data .",
    "as mentioned above there is only one parameter that is not at least partly constrained by photometry or prior knowledge , which is the projected obliquity .",
    "this is the qualitative explanation for the mcmc result of @xmath144 degrees .",
    "note that the _ a priori _ knowledge on is crucial in this situation ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "we illustrate this point by runing a chain without using the prior knowledge on , where the uncertainty interval is enlarged to @xmath145 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : koi244_no_vsini_prior ] .",
    "however it is not completely satisfactory to argue for a low obliquity based on the absence of a clear signal .",
    "therefore we sought an independent method to detect the rm effect .",
    "the next section describes our analysis of a wavelength region in which no iodine lines are present , and which therefore was not used in the determination of the rvs .",
    "we used this spectral range to make a second independent measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "* kepler-25 results without using prior knowledge on .",
    "* the same as the left panels from figure  [ fig : koi244_rv_results ] but this time without using the prior .",
    "constequently the uncertainties for @xmath0 and increased to @xmath145 and @xmath146 . ]      in this method of analysis we did not use rvs as proxies for the distortions in the stellar absorption lines .",
    "instead we analyzed the line shapes directly to infer @xmath0 .",
    "the transiting planet selectively distorts the line profile , blocking a certain range of velocity components that ordinarily contribute to the overall line broadening , a phenomenon referred to as the `` doppler shadow '' by @xcite . to model this phenomenon we used a code developed for double - lined eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for binary star systems , the difficulty lays in the additional set of stellar absorption lines originating from the eclipsing foreground star . in the case of planetary transits ,",
    "this particular difficulty is eliminated , as the planet s emitted light is negligible ; rather , the challenge stems from the small amplitude of the rm signal . in the case of a jupiter - sized",
    "planet such as hat - p-2b , about 1% of the light is blocked from view . in the case of the transit of planet",
    "c in front of kepler-25 only @xmath147  % of the light is blocked .",
    "for this reason we will present the application of our code to the jupiter - sized planet in the bright ( @xmath148 ) hat - p-2 system , as a test case .",
    "we then proceed to the more challenging kepler-25 system .",
    "we used a two - step process to measure @xmath0 from stellar spectra . in the first step we combined the signals from many stellar absorption lines into one high - s / n absorption line , which we will call the `` kernel . ''",
    "the spectrum is modeled as the convolution of the kernel and a series of @xmath149-functions at the central wavelengths of the absorption lines .",
    "this was done for each individual spectrum . in the second step",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent changes in radial velocity of the telluric lines are measurement artifacts , caused by changes in the psf , which also apply to stellar lines .",
    "we suspect that on top of the rv shifts higher order changes occur , which our algorithm can not correct with sufficiently accuracy to allow for the detection of the small distortion induced by the planetary transit . during the observations of our test system hat - p-2 the air - mass also changed significantly , from 1.2 to 2 , and the observed rvs of telluric lines changed by @xmath233  kms@xmath7 .",

    "our results disfavor theories which aim to explain large obliquities due to a change in the angle between protoplanetary disk and the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or changes in the internal structure of the star @xcite .",
    "of course it must be acknowledged that a sample of 5 systems is not sufficient for a firm conclusion .",
    "the systems studied here only cover a small parameter space , for example a limited range in stellar mass .",
    "in other systems , mechanisms for tilting stars may be more important .",
    "one clue that this is indeed the case is the finding that both stars in the diherculis system are strongly inclined with respect to their mutual orbit @xcite . here however , we have found that the evidence to date supports the conclusion that the high obliquities of hot - jupiter systems are due to evolution of the planets orbits .",

    "one type of process changes the obliquity while the other does not .",
    "we could identify disk migration with the latter , and dynamical interactions with the former .",
    "we note , though , that it is not necessarily true that the compact multiplanet systems have experienced inward migration ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed for changing the orbital inclination of a planet .",

    "another way to test theories of hot jupiters involving tidal circularization from a highly eccentric orbit is to search for their putative high - eccentricity progenitors .",
    "@xcite predicted that there should be a stream of gas giant on very eccentric orbits ( eccentricity @xmath247 ) if hot jupiters were transported directly inwards from beyond the snow line .",
    "@xcite searched the _ kepler _ database for such objects , did not find any , and placed an upper bound on such a population .",
    "this indicates that if kctf is an important migration path , then likely the starting point for kctf is closer than the snow line .",
    "this suggests that gas giants migrate via a combination of processes .",
    "for example initial scattering or disk migration followed by kozai cycles and finally tidal circularization .",
    "in the multiple - planet systems koi-94 and kepler-25 we measured good alignment between the stellar rotation axes and the orbital plane of the transiting planets . for both systems we used the radial velocity anomaly ( rossiter - mclaughlin effect ) during planetary transits to determine the degree of alignment . for koi-94 our result is consistent with an independent study by @xcite . as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in the kepler-25 system has only a small amplitude , we further measured the distortion of the stellar absorption lines directly in another part of the obtained stellar spectra .",
    "we found consistent results with both methods .",
    "combining our results with measurements in three other multiple planet systems ( kepler-30 , kepler-50 , kepler-65 ) we can now compare the obliquity distributions of multiple planet systems to the obliquities measured in hot - jupiter systems .",
    "we find that there is only a @xmath72% chance that multiple planet systems have a isotropic obliquity distribution .",
    "this is in contrast to the apparent isotropic obliquity distribution in hot - jupiter systems when taking tidal realignment into account ( i.e. , omitting systems with relatively strong tidal interactions ) .",
    "our results support the idea that the inward migration of close in gas - giants is fundamentally different from the migration occurring in compact multiple planet systems .",
    "it suggests that the planets we see in the multiple planet systems might have migrated via disk - planet interactions while hot - jupiters must have taken a different route .",
