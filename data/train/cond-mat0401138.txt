    "the influence of a magnetic field on the coulomb drag are investigated in different geometries .",
    "the coulomb drag between two two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum wells in a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the planes of the wells and in the presence of disorder has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in magnetic field",
    "perpendicular to the planes the hall voltage can be induced in the drag quantum well in the direction perpendicular to both direction of the magnetic field and of the current in the drive well  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "these two geometries can be called transverse .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the influence of an in - well magnetic field @xmath2 on the coulomb drag current in the course of ballistic ( collisionless ) electron transport in a quantum well due to a ballistic drive current in a parallel quantum well .",
    "in other words , we consider the longitudinal geometry , i.e. the case where the magnetic field is parallel to the applied electric field @xmath3 and to the plane of the well itself .",
    "we will concern ourselves with the case of a strong magnetic field that makes the motion of the carriers along the field one dimensional and alters the density of electron states .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves with the quantum limit when only the ground landau oscillator states are occupied by electrons in the two quantum wells , so that @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the cyclotron frequency while @xmath6 is the chemical potential .",
    "a theory of electronic transport through three - dimensional ballistic microwires in longitudinal magnetic fields at low temperatures has been developed in ref .",
    "our geometry is similar to that considered in ref .",
    ". however , in the present paper we consider much simpler situation of a very strong magnetic field satisfying eq .",
    "( [ 1z ] ) . later on we hope to return to a more general case of a weaker magnetic field where several landau levels may be involved .    the magnetic field making the motion of the electrons in the transverse direction one dimensional maps the problem under consideration onto the coulomb drag problem in two one - dimensional wires already considered by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite in the fermi liquid approach .",
    "therefore , our final formulae for the coulomb drag current appear to be similar to those obtained in  @xcite .",
    "physically the magnetic field may play the following important role .",
    "it will suppress the tunneling of electrons between the quantum wells that , if present , would impede observation of the coulomb drag .    the magnetic field may change the electron quasimomentum relaxation time .",
    "scattering of electrons by ionized impurities in sufficiently strong magnetic fields may be even weaker than for @xmath7 .",
    "as for the relaxation due to the phonon scattering , a strong magnetic field can alter the density of electron states and in the quantum limit the relaxation rate may be bigger than for @xmath7 .",
    "we , however , will assume the temperature to be so low that the transport remains ballistic even in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "we consider the case where the magnetic length @xmath8 is much smaller than the distance @xmath9 between the quantum wells of the width @xmath10 each @xmath11    this inequality establishes lower bound for the values of the magnetic field for a given distance between the quantum wells .",
    "for instance , for @xmath12 nm the inequality requires magnetic fields of the order of @xmath13 t , or bigger .",
    "it is convenient to break our calculations into several parts . in the first part we will give the principal equations of our theory based on the boltzmann treatment of the transport .",
    "we will consider a linear response in sec .",
    "next we will discuss a non - ohmic case in sec .",
    "comparison of our results with the 1d coulomb drag results in the longitudinal geometry and 2d coulomb drag results for @xmath7 will be given in summary .",
    "we consider two parallel quantum wells perpendicular to @xmath14 axis .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a one electron problem in a magnetic field along the @xmath15 axis in the @xmath16th quantum well is [ we use the gauge @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the effective electron mass , @xmath21 $ ] is the wave function of a harmonic oscillator in the ground state oscillating about the point @xmath22 . the wave function @xmath23 describes a state for which the electron probability distribution is large only within the slab of the width @xmath24 symmetrically situated about the plane @xmath25 and falls off exponentially outside the slab . as we consider the case @xmath26 we will assume the wave function to be equal @xmath23 if @xmath27 is within the quantum well and zero otherwise . in what follows we will need the matrix elements of the functions @xmath28 between two stationary states .",
