    "in recent years , development of minimally invasive measurement techniques for determining the biomechanical properties of biological and artificial replacement tissues has become a problem of paramount importance in medicine .",
    "the mechanical properties of biomaterials can be evaluated by means of simple indentation techniques @xcite , which have been proved useful for both identification of mechanical properties of a soft biological tissue , like articular cartilage @xcite , and assessing its viability during arthroscopy @xcite .",
    "indentation tests are performed with various indenter geometries , and among the most frequently used types of indenters are axisymmetric ( in particular , cylindrical , spherical , and conical ) indenters .",
    "development of an indentation test for the articular cartilage layer requires solving the corresponding contact problem for an elastic layer ( see fig .",
    "[ figarbitray]a ) . the widely used mathematical model for indentation tests of articular cartilage developed by hayes _",
    "@xcite is based on the analytical solution @xcite of the frictionless contact problem for an elastic layer bonded to a rigid base .",
    "the hayes _",
    "_ model allows to take into account the thickness effect , but , at the same time , it neglects the substrate effect . in order to take into account the influence of the substrate deformation",
    ", we consider the frictionless contact problem for an elastic layer bonded to an elastic half - space ( see fig .",
    "[ figarbitray]b ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the quasistatic unilateral contact problem for a rigid axisymmetric indenter pressed into a homogeneous , linearly elastic and transversely isotropic elastic layer bonded to a homogeneous , linearly elastic and transversely isotropic half - space .",
    "we focus on deriving asymptotic approximations for the force - displacement relation ( that is the relation between the contact force @xmath0 and the indenter displacement @xmath1 ) , which constitutes the basis for developing depth - sensing indentation tests . in the isotropic case , the substrate effect in the flat - ended and spherical indentation",
    "was studied recently in @xcite based on the asymptotic solutions obtained in @xcite .",
    "the main novelty of the present paper consists in considering the case of an arbitrary axisymmetric indenter . as a special case , we study the indentation problem for a blunt punch of power - law profile .",
    "the main difficulty for an analytical analysis of the axisymmetric unilateral contact problem is associated with the fact that the radius @xmath2 of the circular contact area @xmath3 is not known in advance and must be determined as a part of the solution .",
    "apparently the first asymptotic analysis of the axisymmetric contact problem for an arbitrary axisymmetric indenter dates back to england , whose work @xcite was published in 1962 . as a special case , england @xcite considered the indentation problem for a hemispherically ended punch and obtained asymptotic expansions in terms of powers of a small parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the curvature radius of the hemispherical end",
    ", @xmath6 is the thickness of the elastic layer .",
    "our asymptotic analysis is based on a small parameter @xmath7 defined as the ratio of the contact radius to the layer thickness .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to the method originally developed by england @xcite , we construct asymptotic expansions in terms of an unknown quantity in the same way as in the asymptotic method of large @xmath8 developed by vorovich _",
    "however , our approach differs from previous studies @xcite in two ways .",
    "first , we do not construct an asymptotic expansion for the contact pressure , but for the aim of deriving the force - displacement relation , following @xcite , we derive exact equations for the contact force and the contact radius and operate with integral characteristics of the contact pressure .",
    "second , we perform asymptotic analysis of the resulting non - linear algebraic problem obtaining the approximate force - displacement relation in explicit form , which is most suited for development of indentation tests .",
    "we consider the unilateral frictionless contact problem for an elastic layer bonded to an elastic half - space , which is made of a different material .",
    "let the composite elastic medium occupying the half - space @xmath9 be indented by an arbitrary frictionless axisymmetric indenter .",
    "assuming that the @xmath10-axis coincides with the axis of symmetry of the indenter , we will describe its surface by the equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shape function whose dependence on the cartesian coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 comes through a polar radius @xmath15 . without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath16 .    under the assumption that the indenter shape function @xmath12 is convex and the indenter is loaded with a normal force , @xmath0 , which is directed along the positive @xmath10-axis , contact between the indenter and the surface of the elastic medium will be established over a circular region , @xmath3 , say , of radius @xmath2 . for a blunt indenter , the contact area @xmath3 is variable and depends on the contact force @xmath0 .",
    "further , let @xmath17 be the surface influence function for the elastic medium that gives the vertical surface displacement of the elastic layer under a unit point force applied at the origin of coordinates and directed along @xmath10-axis . then , the unilateral contact problem under consideration , which involves an a priori unknown contact area @xmath3 , reduces to that of solving the following integral equation : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the contact pressure , @xmath1 is the indenter displacement",
    ".    it should be emphasized that eq .",
    "( [ a1z(1.2 ) ] ) implicitly contains an a priori unknown radius @xmath2 of the contact area @xmath3 , which is to be determined as a part of solution from the following conditions : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is a polar radius .    by the equilibrium equation , the external contact force @xmath0",
    "is related to the contact pressure density @xmath19 as follows : @xmath22    due to the axisymmetry of the elastic medium , the surface influence function can be represented as @xmath23 where @xmath6 is the layer thickness , @xmath24 is an elastic constant related to the first layer , @xmath25 is a dimensionless function .",

    "in the present paper , we employ an asymptotic approach to derive approximate analytical formulas for @xmath31 in the small - contact limit , that is under the assumption that the contact radius @xmath2 is small compared with the layer thickness @xmath6 .",
    "in the axisymmetric case , eq .  ( [ a1z(1.2 ) ] ) can be reduced to a simpler form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath34 is a dimensionless function given by @xmath35j_0(\\sigma u)j_0(\\tau u)\\,du . \\label{a1z(2.2)}\\ ] ]    in the neighborhood of the origin , the function @xmath34 has the following absolutely convergent expansion @xcite : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 are given by ( [ a1z(1.8 ) ] ) .",
