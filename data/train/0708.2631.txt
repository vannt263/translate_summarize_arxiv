    "ever since hubble ( 1926 ) investigated the apparent flattenings of early - type galaxies , numerous studies have attempted to pin down their intrinsic shapes .",
    "such efforts mainly focused on the apparent axis ratio not only because it is easy to measure but also its distribution can be used to extract the kinematics and may even constrain the general formation history of galaxies .",
    "early studies using apparent axis ratio distribution ( ard ) were made on the assumption that early - type galaxies are composed of one type .",
    "assuming oblateness alone , sandage , freeman , & stokes ( 1970 ) suggested the possibility of gaussian or skewed binomial distribution of intrinsic ard using reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc1 , de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1964 ) .",
    "binney ( 1978 ) s approach assuming prolateness also successfully reproduced the apparent ard from rc1 .",
    "the existence of triaxial galaxies ( bertola & capaccioli 1975 ; illingworth 1977 ) opened up a better chance to reproduce the observed ard . binggeli ( 1980 ) and benacchio & bertola ( 1980 ) showed that the apparent ards for 160 ellipticals from revised - shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tammann 1979 ) and 348 ellipticals from strom & strom ( 1978a , b , c ) were well represented as a group of triaxial galaxies assuming a fixed case of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ratio between the second longest to the longest axis and @xmath8 is the shortest to the longest axis .",
    "in particular , binney & de vaucouleurs ( 1981 ) aimed to reconstruct the apparent ard for rc2 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1976 ) using lucy s inversion technique ( lucy 1974 , see also noerdinger 1979 ) .",
    "they considered oblate , prolate and triaxial ( o , p , t ) separately and still found acceptable fits to the observed ard .",
    "the limitation of this technique , however , is that it is difficult to constrain the ratios between o , p , t galaxies .",
    "more recently , fasano & vio ( 1991 ) concluded that a purely - biaxial model can not reproduce the small number of apparently - round galaxies .",
    "this paucity however looks significantly different when samples are drawn from different catalogs ( e.g. , rc1 , rc2 , or revised - shapley - ames catalog of galaxies ) .",
    "this obviously results in disparate intrinsic distributions .",
    "furthermore , lambas et al . ( 1992 ) found a reasonable fit to the sample of 2,135 galaxies from the apm bright galaxy survey ( maddox 1990 ) assuming all ellipticals are triaxial whose intrinsic distributions are two dimensional gaussian .",
    "the similar work done by ryden ( 1992 ) presents consistent results .",
    "these results support the assertion that the paucity of round galaxies can be reproduced by a dominantly - triaxial galaxy population . considering its usefulness ,",
    "it is important to accurately sample the observed ard .",
    "fortunately , sloan digital sky survey data ( adelman - mccarthy et al . 2005 ) allows us to study the apparent flattenings for a large number of galaxies . our effort to make a complete volume - limited sample is one of the main factors distinguishing our work from previous studies .",
    "we also note the interesting result of davies et al .",
    "( 1983 ) that bright ellipticals may be more slowly rotating than faint ones .",
    "tremblay & merritt ( 1996 ) found that the apparent ard is markedly different for two luminosity classes ; the ellipticals brighter than @xmath9 are rounder than less luminous ones .",
    "in particular , recent observations show that the division clearly occurs at @xmath10 ( rest & van den bosch 2001 ) and also support previous works suggesting that bright galaxies show a core profile and boxy isophotes while faint galaxies have a power - law profile and disky isophotes ( bender 1988 , kormendy & bender 1996 , faber et al 1997 ) .",
    "therefore we investigate on the effect of the galaxy luminosity on the ard .",
    "another factor we should note for intrinsic shape of early - type galaxies is an environmental dependence .",
    "dressler ( 1980 ) pointed out a density - morphology relation which reflects the importance on the formation process .",
    "we thus search for the connection between intrinsic shape and environment for early types .    in this paper",
    ", we propose two simplifying assumptions ; ( i ) early - type galaxies are geometrically perfect ellipsoid , ( ii ) they are randomly oriented .",
    "we assume that early types consist of oblate , prolate and triaxial .",
    "we believe this assumption makes our approach more realistic than the previous models composed of only one or limited types . on this basis",
    "we investigate the projection effect on the apparent ard .",
    "we simply describe the model distribution for oblate , prolate and triaxial in  2 .",
    "we introduce our sample selection with completeness tests in  3 . in  4 , we investigate the intrinsic ard for volume - limited samples . in  5 , we analyze the intrinsic shape of two different luminosity samples .",
    "dependence of environment on ard is investigated in  6 . in  7",
    ", we discuss the limitations of our approach .",
    "finally , we discuss results and their implication in  8 .",
    "we use an analytical description to calculate the probability distribution ( franx et al . 1991 ; binney & merrifield , 1998 ) .",
    "the probability of finding the apparent ellipticity ( @xmath11 ) in the interval ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate three axes of an ellipsoid , respectively .",
    "for galaxies with @xmath20 ( oblate - triaxial ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which depend on the galaxy shape , are @xmath23 where @xmath24 . for galaxies with @xmath25 ( prolate - triaxial ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be written as @xmath26 in order to illustrate the type ( opt)-dependence of the apparent ard , we adopt the classification scheme of franx et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . to classify the early - type systems , we use triaxiality ( t ) , @xmath27 and each type can be expressed as @xmath28    in this study , we assume that there is no early - type galaxy with axis ratios smaller than 0.2 because such systems are rarely observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we display the classification scheme .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the simplest special case of the apparent ard , that is based on ( _ uniformly - distributed _ intrinsic axis ratios .",
    "we mean _ no preferred values of the intrinsic ratios _ by `` uniformly- distributed '' .",
    "the numbers of the samples of three ( opt ) types simulated are normalised to be the same , hence unbiased by the area difference between the types in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "if an observed ard has a large number of round galaxies near 1 , we can deduce that oblate is the main component , for example .",

    "the sdss provides a large homogeneous database .",
    "there are approximately 28,000 galaxies within @xmath0 , an excellent sample for studying ard statistically . in this section ,",
    "we describe our data selection scheme and completeness tests .",
    "a well - defined criterion for morphological classification is necessary to study the ard of early - type galaxies .",
    "because visual inspection of all galaxies is extremely time - consuming and still subjective , we adopted the sdss pipeline parameter @xmath29 , which indicates the fraction of the brightness profile that can be explained by the de vaucouleurs profile ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates de vaucouleurs fluxes .",
    "we assume that a conservative sample of early - type galaxies have @xmath32 in all 3 bands , @xmath33 , following the practice of yi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . using this @xmath29 parameter",
    ", we compile 4,994 galaxies within @xmath0 .",
    "a complete volume - limited sample is crucial for this study because it has a direct effect on the intrinsic shapes of galaxies .",
    "but sdss provides spectroscopic information only for the galaxies of @xmath34 ; hence , our sample can not be free from luminosity bias . to investigate this",
    ", we need to know how the ard varies with the size of major axis .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the trend that the luminosity gradually increases with increasing minor axis for a fixed major axis size .",
    "this effect is clearer for the larger galaxies ( red and blue dots ) but less clear for smaller galaxies ( black dots ) probably because of the magnitude limit .",
    "we also denote the general trends of the three different luminosity classes with three lines .",
    "it is clear that small faint flat early types are more easily missed , and so the luminosity limit biases the apparent ard .",
    "we have decided to exclude galaxies with major axis radius @xmath35 smaller than 16.2  .",
    "this however has a tendency of removing distant faint galaxies from the sample . in order to alleviate this problem",
    ", we construct a volume - limited sample by selecting close galaxies within @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , no redshift dependence is considered important here .",
    "note that odewahn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) already reported that there is no significant difference in the apparent ard between distant and nearby samples . constraining the absolute magnitude range , statistical kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks )",
    "test confirms that distant ( @xmath37 ) and close ( @xmath0 ) galaxies share the same parent ard with a 99%-level confidence .",
    "therefore , the results from the analysis on our close ( @xmath0 ) sample likely holds for a larger redshift range .    .",
    "galaxies of different apparent isophotal major - axis sizes are grouped into 3 bins : orange dots denote the largest galaxies .",
    "three dashed lines show the trend that rounder galaxies are brighter for a fixed apparent axis ratio .",
    "faint flat small galaxies ( @xmath38 ) , near black dotted line , are missed in this kind of survey ( see text).,width=302 ]      it is also of interest whether our main selection criterion _ fracdev _ @xmath39 influences the ard .",
    "s. joo ( priv . comm . ) performed an independent classification of early types using _ fracdev _ and visual inspection , for two different _ fracdev _ limits , _",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41_fracdev _ @xmath42 .",
    "he pointed out to us that the higher _ fracdev _ criterion misses some early types , mainly flatter galaxies .",
    "for example , if one uses lower _ fracdev _ limit , the fraction of relatively flatter ( b / a @xmath43 0.6 ) galaxies with @xmath44 would be 5.9% , while the fraction for higher _ fracdev _ limit is 3.9% . in this regard , our sample does not represent the entire early - type galaxy population but is slightly biased towards rounder galaxies .",
    "we decided , however , not to worry about this , first because the exact _ fracdev _ criterion for early types is unclear , and second because we are for the moment more interested in the methodology .",
    "our final sample of 3,922 galaxies is chosen with redshift criterion ( @xmath0 ) and major axis criterion ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we remove a small number of relatively faint outliers of @xmath46 to ensure reasonable image quality . but",
    "this has no impact on our results at all .",
    "we also exclude 1,072 galaxies from the 4,994 galaxy sample because they appear to be spiral contaminants or severely - distorted in the visual inspection .",
    "the ard for final sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we also plot the apparent ard from apmbgs data ( loveday 1996 ) .",

    "it was demonstrated in fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "that the apparent ard is not uniform even though the intrinsic distribution is uniform . to extract the intrinsic shapes of our galaxies",

    "we compare the observation with model distributions using two strategies .",

    "weight directly reflects the frequency of each type .",
    "the best solution that makes a minimum @xmath51 is @xmath58 but for a very poor statistic ( @xmath59 ) .",

    "yoon s measurements are improved over schawinski et al.s primarily by including more candidate member galaxies assuming that early - type galaxies obey optical color - magnitude relations .",

    "the apparent ards are found to share the same parent distribution via a k - s test .",
    "it should be noted that ryden ( 1993 ) reported a similar result , finding no significant difference in the ard in her sample of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that semi - analytic models also show consistent results .",
    "khochfar & silk ( 2006 ) assert that the stellar properties of merging remnants of massive galaxies above the characteristic mass ( @xmath102 ; kauffmann et al .",

    "considering the brightness of our sample galaxies @xmath103 through @xmath104 , and assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio 5 , most of our galaxies would exceed the characteristic mass .",

    "for example , a gaussian distribution of oblate galaxies parameterized with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( in the @xmath8 direction ) would inevitably have galaxies lying outside the oblate territory by the classification scheme ( figure 1 ) : mostly into triaxial .",
    "this is particularly so when @xmath62 is large and for triaxial ellipticals due to the type definition .",
    "nevertheless , our exercise showed that the preferred axis ratios and type weights are robustly derived by assuming gaussian distribution .    in table 2 , we present the preferred axis ratios ( @xmath61 ) corresponding to the most probable case showing reliable convergence and the gaussian width ( @xmath62 ) for three different classification schemes .",
    "the results on @xmath61 and @xmath62 appear to be reasonably consistent between m1 and m2 , but m3 shows a larger difference .",
    "the slight difference in the opt fractions derived is easy to understand .",
    "for example , the fractions of oblate and prolate in the m3 case are greater than those in m1 ; this is natural because there are more possible oblate or prolate configurations in m3 than in m1 . in fig .",

    "we have investigated on the intrinsic shape distribution of early - type galaxies .",
    "we show that the de - projection results can be affected by the details of the selection criteria of the observed data .",

    "the prolate show a peak at @xmath112 with a comparable fraction to that of oblate ( 26% ) .",
    "recent numerical n - body simulations suggest that the shapes of dark matter halos favor triaxial or prolate over oblate ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 , barnes 1992 , jing & suto 2002 , bailin & steinmetz 2005 , novak et al .",
    "this is consistent with our result at least in the sense that triaxial is favored , while a small discrepancy is found in the values of the preferred intrinsic axis ratios .",
    "dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) proposed that dark matter halos are triaxial with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively , which is somewhat more flattened than we derived . in order to reproduce the observed ard using these preferences for triaxial type , specifically - designed distributions for oblate and prolate types",

    "novak et al . ( 2006 ) also pointed out the disparity in the halo shape between the stellar and dark matter components .",

    "hence , we should investigate all possible parameter space in order to make a realistic comparison with observation .",
    "in addition , because elliptical - elliptical mergers , as well as spiral - spiral mergers , can lead to form an elliptical galaxy , the parameter space is large . furthermore , there appear to be two distinct classes of early - type galaxies separated by their luminosity ( bender 1988 , kormendy & bender 1996 ) .",
    "these studies indicate that luminous galaxies are typically supported by anisotropic velocity and have boxy isophotes while faint early - types show disky isophotes . on this basis , we search for a clue on their formation history using the opt parameters we derived .",
    "our results indicate that the `` luminous '' sample ( @xmath117 ) are mostly triaxial ( @xmath118 ) while the `` less luminous '' sample have a large number of oblate types ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "interestingly , no clear difference in the preferred axis ratios of opt types between the two samples .",
    "khochfar & burkert ( 2003 ; 2005 ) suggest that the origin of the two classes could come from the different types of progenitor being merged ( c.f . ,",
    "valluri & merritt , 1998 ) .",
    "their semi - analytic models suggest that bright early types tend to form from elliptical - elliptical mergers .",
    "naab et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also pointed out that spiral - spiral mergers can not reproduce the observed fraction of anisotropic early - types , and that boxy , anisotropic system can form by binary mergers of early - type galaxies . if early - type mergers are the main channels to form bright anisotropic galaxies , and if our triaxial galaxies correspond to anisotropic early - types while oblate types are rotationally - supported systems , our results show reasonable agreement with naab et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in terms of the ratio of anisotropic to the total number of early - type galaxies . the fraction of the anisotropic galaxies in the `` luminous '' and the `` less luminous '' samples are around 0.8 and 0.4 , respectively ( naab et al .",
    "2006 ) , which are arguably similar to our results @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    since",
    "different merging events are proposed to result in different configurations for early - type galaxies , it is also of interest to investigate whether there is connection between environment and galaxy shape .",
    "we do not find a clear dependence on the local galaxy density . considering that the galaxy number density parameter generally represents the dark matter halo potential for the galaxy cluster , this",
    "may imply that such a cluster - scale environment might have little effect to the intrinsic shapes of individual galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the results from the semi - analytic study of khochfar & silk ( 2006 ) .",
    "our analysis has caveats .",
    "the quantitative aspects of our simulation results depend on the opt classification scheme .",
    "besides , when the fraction of a type ( oblate , prolate , or triaxial ) is small , our method fails to constrain the preferred values of mean axis ratios and gaussian widths . with the improvement on these caveats and detailed study of n - body simulations",
    ", we hope our work can provide a simple framework to investigate the formation history of early - type galaxies .",
    "we are very grateful to seok - joo joo who kindly provided advice on the galaxy morphology , and chang h. ree for many useful comments on the data selection .",
    "this work could not have been the same without their help .",
    "we thank sadegh khochfar , tim de zeeuw and james binney for constructive comments in the early stage .",
