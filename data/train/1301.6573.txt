    "charged particles are accelerated to relativistic energies in many astrophysical objects . in addition",
    ", turbulence is also expected .",
    "in fact , strong turbulence is observed in recent two and three dimensional simulations for supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) @xcite , astrophysical jets @xcite , etc .",
    "there are mainly two acceleration mechanisms by turbulence .",
    "one is due to wave - particle interactions , where the particle mean free path is comparable to the wavelength of electromagnetic fluctuations ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other is due to large - scale fluctuations of plasma flows , where the particle mean free path is smaller than turbulent scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "turbulence is generally divided by compressible and incompressible modes .",
    "particle acceleration by large - scale compressible turbulence has been discussed in many paper ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , particle acceleration by large - scale incompressible turbulence ( turbulent shear acceleration ) has not been investigated in detail , while @xcite has briefly discussed the turbulent shear acceleration .",
    "particle acceleration by a simple incompressible flow ( shear flow ) has already investigated in many paper ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , shear flows are potentially unstable to the kelvin - helmholtz instability and produce turbulence .",
    "therefore , the turbulent shear acceleration is expected to be important . in this letter , we investigate the turbulent shear acceleration by considering ensemble average of an extended transport equation which includes particle acceleration by shear flows .",
    "we first derive an ensemble - averaged transport equation in section 2 , and provide its analytical solutions for simple cases in section 3 . we then perform monte carlo simulations in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion .",
    "in this section , we derive the ensemble - averaged transport equation of energetic particles . propagation and acceleration of energetic charged particles in a plasma flow",
    "are described by a transport equation .",
    "@xcite derived the transport equation which includes spatial diffusion , convection , and adiabatic acceleration .",
    "after that his work was extended by several authors . for isotropic diffusion and a nonrelativistic plasma flow , the extended transport equation is given by ( equation ( 4.5 ) of @xcite and equation ( 9 ) of @xcite ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is defined by @xmath2 @xmath3 are the distribution function , position , plasma velocity , and spatial diffusion coefficient , respectively . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the particle velocity and four momentum in the fluid rest frame , respectively .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath6 , is represented by @xmath7 for isotropic diffusion , where @xmath8 is the mean scattering time and @xmath9 is the particle mean free path .",
    "the first four terms of equation ( [ eq : transporteq ] ) are the same as the parker equation and the others are additional terms .",
    "the fifth term describes the shear acceleration and the sixth term becomes important for @xmath10 .    in order to understand essential features of the turbulent shear acceleration",
    ", we consider incompressible turbulence ( @xmath11 ) and do not take into account the spatial transport , that is , we consider the spatially averaged distribution function , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the system volume that we consider . by integrating equation ( [ eq : transporteq ] ) ,",
    "the extended transport equation can be reduced to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the particle flux passing through the surface of the integrated volume . as long as we consider a timescale smaller than @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", we can neglect the particle flux , @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , we can neglect escape of particles from the system when we consider a sufficiently large system size .    in this letter",
    ", we assume that the plasma velocity field , @xmath18 , is static , random , statistically homogenous and isotropic incompressible turbulence , that is , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes ensemble average .",
    "the correlation function of the plasma velocity field is given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the wavenumber and spectrum of incompressible turbulence , respectively .",
    "as long as we consider only particle acceleration , we can assume the velocity field to be static when the scattering timescale , @xmath26 , is smaller than the variable timescale of fluid , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a phase velocity .",
    "in this letter , we consider @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 .",
    "hence , we can assume a static velocity field in this letter .",
    "the distribution function of particles can also be divided by an ensemble - averaged component and a fluctuated one , that is , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the spatial average in equation ( [ eq : req ] )",
    "can be interpreted as ensemble average because we consider a system size larger than the turbulent scale .",
    "then , from equation ( [ eq : req ] ) , the ensemble - averaged transport equation is represented by @xmath34 where we have assumed that distributions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are symmetric about the mean values , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , so that third moments are zero . from equations ( [ eq : coreelation ] ) , ( [ eq : vspectrum ] ) , and ( [ eq : aat ] ) , the ensemble - averaged transport equation can be represented by @xmath39 where the momentum diffusion coefficient , @xmath40 , is given by @xmath41 we here consider turbulence with a large lengthscale compared with the particle mean free path , @xmath9 , so that the upper limit of @xmath24-integral should be limited by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the maximum wavenumber of turbulence and @xmath44 .",
    "the momentum diffusion coefficient , @xmath45 , is dominated by small scale turbulence when @xmath46 is an increasing function of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the turbulent shear acceleration becomes important in the small scale for a kolmogorov - like spectrum ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "in this section , we present specific expressions of the momentum diffusion coefficient and analytical solutions of the ensemble - averaged transport equation for simple velocity spectra .",
    "we especially focus on the turbulent shear acceleration of relativistic particles ( @xmath48 ) in nonrelativistic turbulence ( @xmath49 ) , so that we neglect the term of @xmath50 in equation  ( [ eq : ds ] ) .",
    "we here assume a functional form of the mean scattering time , @xmath8 , to be @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the initial four momentum and the mean scattering time of particles with @xmath52 , respectively . to make the expression simple , hereafter the four momentum , time , and momentum diffusion coefficient are normalized by @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "normalized quantities are denoted with a tilde .    for a static monochromatic spectrum of incompressible turbulence ,",
    "@xmath25 is given by @xmath56 from equations ( [ eq : ds ] ) and ( [ eq : sm ] ) , the momentum diffusion coefficient is represented by @xmath57 for a static kolmogorov - like spectrum of incompressible turbulence , we assume that @xmath25 is given by @xmath58 then , from equations ( [ eq : ds ] ) and ( [ eq : sk ] ) , the momentum diffusion coefficient is represented by @xmath59 where we have assumed @xmath60 .",
    "the factor , @xmath61 , is expected to be large .",
    "therefore , the kolmogorov - like turbulent cascade enhances the turbulent shear acceleration . for @xmath62 , @xmath63",
    "is represented by @xmath64 therefore , the momentum diffusion coefficient can be represented by @xmath65 for above simple cases , where @xmath66 for the monochromatic spectrum and the kolmogorov spectrum of the case @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for the kolmogorov spectrum of the case @xmath62 .",
    "we next discuss analytical solutions of the ensemble - averaged transport equation .",
    "we assume that particles are uniformly distributed in the three dimensional space and injected at time , @xmath69 , with the four momentum , @xmath70 .",
    "then , the ensemble - averaged transport equation is represented by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of injected particles .",
    "if the momentum diffusion coefficient is represented by @xmath65 , for @xmath73 , the solution is given by @xcite @xmath74~~ , \\label{eq : analytical}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the solution approches @xmath76 for @xmath77 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the solution is given by @xcite @xmath79 and the evolution of the mean momentum , @xmath80 , is given by @xmath81 note that solutions of equations ( [ eq : analytical ] ) and ( [ eq : analytical0 ] ) are not valid for @xmath82 and @xmath83 because of causality .",
    "in order to confirm analytical solutions presented in the previous section , we perform test particle monte carlo simulations .",
    "we here focus on static , statistically homogenous and isotropic incompressible turbulence , that is , the velocity field , @xmath84 , is divergence free .",
    "such a vector field is numerically constructed by a summation of many transverse waves @xcite .",
    "simulation particles are isotropically and elastically scattered in the local fluid frame and move in a straight line between each scattering .",
    "the mean scattering time is given by @xmath85 .",
    "we use @xmath86 simulation particles with the initial four momentum @xmath87 and @xmath88 transverse waves in order to construct velocity fields , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the particle mass and the speed of light .",
    "the mean amplitude of velocity fluctuations is taken to be @xmath91 .",
    "we set the maximum wavenumber to be @xmath92 for the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we first discuss results of monte carlo simulations for the momentum - independent scattering , that is , @xmath93 .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the mean four momentum for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "particles are accelerated , and simulation results are in good agreement with analytical solutions of equations ( [ eq : dm ] ) , ( [ eq : dturbsu ] ) and ( [ eq : mean ] ) . by comparing the growth rate of the mean momentum of simulation particles with equation ( [ eq : mean ] ) , we can obtain the momentum diffusion coefficient of monte carlo simulations .",
    "figure 2 shows the wavenumber dependence of the momentum diffusion coefficient , @xmath96 for @xmath94 .",
    "simulation results are in good agreement with equations ( [ eq : dm ] ) and ( [ eq : dturbsu ] ) as long as @xmath97 , but simulation results for the monochromatic spectrum deviate from equation ( [ eq : dm ] ) at @xmath98 . as already mentioned in section 2 , this is because our treatment is not valid when the particle mean free path is larger than the turbulent scale .",
    "furthermore , we have confirmed that the kolmogorov - like turbulent cascade ( blue ) enhances the turbulent shear acceleration .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution function , @xmath99 , at @xmath100 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "simulation results ( histograms ) are in excellent agreement with analytical solutions of equation ( [ eq : analytical0 ] ) ( solid lines ) for the monochromatic ( red ) and kolmogorov ( blue ) spectra .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution function at @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the monochromatic spectrum with @xmath103 and the bohm - like diffusion , that is , @xmath104 .",
    "simulation results ( histograms ) are in excellent agreement with analytical solutions of equation ( [ eq : analytical ] ) ( solid lines ) except for above @xmath105 .",
    "as mentioned above , the disagreement is due to @xmath106 at @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , we have confirmed that the ensemble - averaged transport equation for incompressible turbulence describes the turbulent shear acceleration and , that is valid as long as the turbulent scale , @xmath108 , is larger than the particle mean free path , @xmath9 .",
    "we first discuss another important effect of turbulence on the particle transport .",
    "@xcite shows that turbulence enhances spatial diffusion . for strong turbulence",
    ", @xmath109 becomes of the order of @xmath110 @xcite , where @xmath111 is the injection lengthscale of turbulence , so that spatial diffusion of particles with a small mean free path is dominated by turbulent diffusion and an energy - independent diffusion is realized .",
    "the ratio of the turbulent diffusion and the bohm diffusion , @xmath112 , is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the proton mass and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "therefore , turbulent diffusion of energetic particles could be important in snrs , pwne , astrophysical jets , etc .    from equation ( [ eq : dturbs ] )",
    ", the acceleration timescale , @xmath116 , of the turbulent shear acceleration for the kolmogorov spectrum of the case @xmath117 is represented by @xmath118 where we have assumed @xmath119 and the bohm diffusion , @xmath120 , in the last equation .",
    "therefore , particles can be accelerated to relativistic energies by large - scale turbulence in many astrophysical objects .",
    "in addition , if particles are initially accelerated at the shock , large - scale turbulence can change energy spectra of the accelerated particles in the shock downstream region .",
    "next , we compare the turbulent shear acceleration and particles acceleration by small - scale incompressible turbulence , that is , the second order acceleration by alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "the momentum diffusion coefficient of the second order acceleration by alfvn waves is given by @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "the ratio of the turbulent shear acceleration and the second order acceleration by alfvn waves is given by @xmath123 where we have adopted equation ( [ eq : dturbs ] ) as @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the turbulent shear acceleration could be more efficient than the second order acceleration by alfvn waves for super - alfvnic turbulence ( @xmath124 ) . in other words ,",
    "the turbulent shear acceleration becomes important when there are strong magnetic field fluctuations ( @xmath125 ) because the plasma velocity fluctuation by alfvn waves , @xmath126 , is represented by @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the fluctuated and mean magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "such a situation is expected to be realized in the downstream region of a high alfvn mach number shock @xcite .",
    "we have considered only isotropic diffusion and nonrelativistic turbulence in this letter .",
    "spatial diffusion is generally anisotropic because of the magnetic field .",
    "isotropic diffusion is realized when magnetic field fluctuations with lengthscale comparable to the particle mean free path are large ( @xmath130 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , as discussed above , the turbulent shear acceleration is important when isotropic diffusion is realized .",
    "simple extensions to anisotropic diffusion and relativistic turbulence are straightforward because extensions of equation ( [ eq : transporteq ] ) have already been provided by @xcite .",
    "this calculation will be addressed in the future work .",
    "in this letter , we have derived a particle transport equation averaged over random plasma flows in order to understand particle acceleration in incompressible turbulence with a larger lengthscale than the particle mean free path .",
    "we have considered ensemble average of the extended transport equation provided by @xcite .",
    "this is a simple extension of previous work that considered ensemble average of the transport equation provided by @xcite .",
    "we have found that the turbulent shear acceleration by incompressible turbulence becomes important in small scale for kolmogorov - like turbulence .",
    "moreover , we have performed monte carlo simulations and confirmed the turbulent shear acceleration .",
    "recent simulations show that turbulence is produced in many astrophysical objects , so that turbulent diffusion and turbulent acceleration are expected to be important .",
