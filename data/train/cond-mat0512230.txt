    "<S> the harmonic signal applied to any or both barriers causes the stationary current . the direction and value of the current depend on the frequency , distance between barriers , value of stationary and oscillating parts of barrier potential and the phase shift between alternating voltages .    the quantum pump or a device which generate a stationary current under action of alternating voltage was a subject of numerous recent publications ( for example , @xcite-@xcite ) . </S>",
