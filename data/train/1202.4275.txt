    "the amount of baryonic matter present in the universe is nowadays measured with high accuracy in the framework of the standard cosmological @xmath1-cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) scenario . according to the most recent cmb observations @xcite the percentage of baryonic density with respect to the critical one is @xmath2 , a figure which is in excellent agreement with the estimates coming from the primordial nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements @xcite and with the baryon budget at high redshift estimated from ly@xmath3 absorption systems @xcite , thus representing one of the most important result of modern cosmology . even if they constitute a minor component in the matter - energy budget , baryons are indeed crucial because , since they interact with the electromagnetic field , they are responsible for all the radiative phenomena , thus providing us the only probe to unveil also the dark components .    on the other side baryons associated to ly@xmath3 absorbers at the present epoch account for only @xmath4 per cent of the cosmic mean @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the cosmic structures form , the baryon census becomes much more challenging and it requires observations at different wavelengths . despite the great improvements in our observational capabilities in the last decade , when accounting for all the matter observed from the optical band ( stars ) to the x - rays ( clusters ) at @xmath5 the amount of observed gas in the universe is much lower than expected .",
    "more precisely , about 3040 per cent of the gas is still out of reach from current observational instruments ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) : this issue is currently referred to as the `` missing baryons '' problem .",
    "the first attempts to address this matter from the theoretical point view come from hydrodynamical simulations @xcite that showed that when galaxy clusters form , a significant amount of the whole intergalactic medium ( igm ) remains out of the virialised halos creating a network of filaments , the so - called cosmic web @xcite , that provide a continuous flow of accreting material to the clusters themselves , located at the knots of the structure .",
    "the gas in these filaments remains at moderate overdensities ( @xmath6 ) and is shock - heated up to temperatures of the order of @xmath0 k , and is usually addressed as the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "given its thermodynamical conditions the hydrogen and helium are fully ionized and emit via free - free interaction with the electrons .",
    "this process together with the line - emission from partly ionized metals is expected to contribute to the x - ray background ( xrb ) in the form of a soft diffuse component .",
    "analysing the current observational constraints , the unresolved emission in the _ chandra _  deep fields ( cdfs ) observed by @xcite in the 0.51 kev band is consistent with the expectations of the diffuse gas obtained from numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , @xcite detected the signature of a possible whim emission in the correlation function of the diffuse emission signal in the 0.40.6 kev band obtained from several _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "on the other side , there have also been claims of detection of whim emission associated to local overdensities of the lss . @xcite",
    "observed at 5@xmath7 a continuum emission from a filament extending between the abell 222 and abell 225 clusters .",
    "similarly , _ rosat _",
    "observations allowed the discovery of a soft diffuse emission consistent with @xmath8 k gas associated with a galaxy group at @xmath9 @xcite and with the sculptor supercluster @xcite .    probably the most important point in whim observation strategies is the fact that this medium is believed to contain metals whose emission and absorption lines provide an effective way to disentangle its signal from background and foreground objects . to this purpose ,",
    "the best targets are c , o , ne and possibly also n , mg and fe . the brightest features are expected from k and l - shell transitions of h - like , he - like and li - like oxygen ions , namely the oviii  @xmath10 doublet ( @xmath11654 ev ) , the ovii  @xmath10 resonance line ( 574 ev ) and the ovi  doublet ( 12 ev ) , respectively .",
    "this method already provided several claimed detections , all regarding absorption lines .",
    "@xcite detected 83 ovi  absorption systems in the uv spectra of 43 agns .",
    "however , since these absorbers are associated to ly@xmath3 counterparts it is not clear how much of this gas can be attributed to the missing part @xcite . at x - ray energies @xcite detected several ovii  absorption features in the spectra of the mrk 421 blazar , but the statistical significance of their measurements",
    "has been questioned @xcite .",
    "several other detections with both _ chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton _  @xcite have been claimed but their statistical significance is low and they mainly correspond to the densest part of the igm ( galaxy clusters or groups ) , indicating that these measurements are at the limit of current observational capabilities .    up to now the detection of emission lines",
    "has proven to be even more difficult . however , detecting the whim in emission can be much more rewarding since it has the potential to map large structures and does not depend on the presence of background sources , thus potentially providing a global picture of whim thermo- and chemo - dynamics , which is by now far from being reached .    in this scenario",
    "a big effort has been put into the modelisation of the whim which becomes crucial in the perspective of future x - ray missions in particular for what concerns the treatment of radiative cooling , stellar and galactic feedback , reionization and , most importantly , chemical enrichment . @xcite and @xcite included for the first time the enrichment from type ii supernovae ( sn - ii ) of different metal species in their eulerian cosmological simulations .",
    "their work showed how the effect of different galactic wind models can change both the thermodynamics and the abundance outside clusters .",
    "more recently @xcite used a similar approach with a set of several large - scale simulations performed with the gadget-3  code , including also type ia supernovae ( sn - ia ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars to study specifically the properties of metal line emission .    in this work",
    "we use the set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite to study and characterize the emission of the whim , with particular emphasis on the of impact different enrichment schemes . starting from the outputs of these simulations ,",
    "we adopt a light - cone reconstruction approach in order to provide a more direct comparison with current and future observational constraints .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will describe the simulation set of @xcite which constitutes the basis of our study . in section  [ sec :",
    "lcones ] we will explain our method to create the mock light - cones and spectra from the outputs of the hydrodynamical simulations . section  [ sec : emission ] is devoted to the analysis of the global properties of the igm and whim emission , while section  [ sec : oxygen ] focuses on our predictions for the oxygen line statistics .",
    "we summarize our results and draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] . unless stated otherwise , when referring to solar metal abundances and relative element yields we will assume the results reported in @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the simulation set of @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to their original work for further details .",
    "the set consists of 8 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed with the treepm - smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2  @xcite in a version that includes the implementation of the chemical enrichment of @xcite .",
    "a summary of the main characteristics of the different runs is shown in table [ tab : sims ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when looking at the results for our reference model , the surface brightness per unit energy of the uxrb associated to the igm is well represented by a power - law ( sb@xmath12 ) with spectral index @xmath130.9 ( 1.5 , for the whim ) in the 0.30.8 kev band , with a clear steepening at higher energies , up to @xmath132.5 ( 3.8 ) in the 0.82 kev band .",
    "these values do not change significantly when other models are considered .    through",
    "all the energy range our igm predictions fall below the upper limits of the uxrb . at energies",
    "@xmath14 kev the expected emission of the whole igm is more than an order of magnitude below the observed uxrb .",
    "this indicates that at soft energies other sources are the main contributors , likely the emission associated to local components ( galaxy and solar system ) . for these reasons the search for lss emission in the uxrb at these energies requires a subtraction of these foreground components with more than 10 per cent accuracy .",
    "a possible observational technique consists in relying on their different angular correlation of the two components , as we will discuss in section  [ sub : acf ] .    on the contrary",
    ", we predict that at energies @xmath15 kev a significant fraction ( from 50 per cent to all ) of the uxrb is due to the emission of the igm .",
    "the high value of the cosmic variance ( reported as error in table  [ tab : sb_mask ] ) together with the low angular surface of the cdfs does not allow us to provide more precise estimates .",
    "when comparing our models with the different feedback and imfs assumptions , the same considerations apply with respect to the discussion on table  [ tab : sb ] : galactic winds increase consistently the expected igm signal .",
    "it is important to point out that in all cases the surface brightness associated to a diffuse whim component is less than half of the total igm one , ranging from @xmath1620 per cent to @xmath1640 per cent from high to low energies , with the only exception of the 50 per cent of the way model in the 0.651 kev band .",
    "this suggests that a consistent part of this signal is not associated with truly diffuse ( @xmath17 ) gas . in particular",
    "this becomes important at @xmath15 kev where the majority of the uxrb due to the lss is clearly associated to cluster outskirts and faint galaxy groups .",
    "however we must consider that lss filaments also contain dense clumps that are excluded by our whim definition so , as a bottom line , we can consider our two estimates , igm and whim , as bracketing the emission associated to the missing baryons component .",
    "given the relatively low surface brightness of the whim , one of the possible techniques to disentangle its signal from the other brighter components ( e.g. galactic emission ) consists in performing a correlation function analysis .",
    "to this purpose we compute the angular ( auto)correlation function ( _ acf _ ) @xmath18 of the surface brightness in the 0.30.8 kev band .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , for a given map we compute its surface brightness contrast @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the surface brightness at the position @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the average of the map .",
    "then we compute the angular correlation function as @xmath23 with this definition a value of @xmath24 corresponds to a random uncorrelated field .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : acf ] our results for the igm and the whim and for our 4 different feedback schemes .    ) while the shaded regions enclose the first and third quartile.,scaledwidth=31.0% ]    as expected ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the igm correlates significantly up to angular scales of 23 arcmin , which correspond to the typical size of galaxy clusters and groups . at larger scales it drops rapidly to values consistent with zero ( @xmath25 arcmin ) .",
    "again , the cosmic variance produces significant deviations ( grey - shaded area ) from map to map .",
    "galactic winds enhance the correlation signal of the igm due to the higher relative clusters emission .",
    "the bh model produces a high correlation only at very low angular scales ( @xmath26 arcmin ) , consistently with what appears from fig .",
    "[ fig : maps_tot ] . on the other side , at @xmath27 2 - 3 arcmin",
    "the _ acf _  is shallower due to the presence of a diffuse emission associated to gas ejected from galactic haloes at early epochs .",
    "when neglecting galactic winds ( nw ) high correlations at @xmath27 2 - 3 arcmin are found as well .",
    "this is associated to the presence of small bright clumps that enhance the halo - halo correlation , and that show fainter peaks when winds are included ( see the maps of fig .  [",
    "fig : maps_tot ] ) . the whim _ acf _  is lower by almost one order of magnitude at low angular scales but has a shallower slope making it comparable to the igm one for @xmath28 arcmin . in this case , the different wind implementations ( w , nw , cw ) produce small variations in the _ acf _ , of the order of 10 per cent",
    ".    we can compare our results with @xcite who detected a putative whim emission by analysing the _ acf _  of 6 different _ xmm - newton _  fields in the 0.40.6 kev band .",
    "in this comparison one must take into account the different normalization adopted with respect to our work : in fact , since they do not know _ a priori _ how much emission is associated to a diffuse component , they normalize @xmath18 to the total uxrb flux , including also the foreground contribution .",
    "we can obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate of the impact of this difference by using our results on the average 0.40.6 kev surface brightness associated to unresolved igm emission ( see section  [ sub : xrb ] ) and compare it to their total uxrb from @xcite : the ratio between the latter and the former is @xmath29 , which translates into a difference in the normalization of the order of @xmath30 . if we apply this correction to the data of @xcite , we obtain a value of @xmath31 for @xmath32=12 arcmin , that falls within a factor of @xmath33 from our igm results .",
    "given the high values of relative errors and cosmic variance associated to these measurements , we can not obtain a more precise estimate , but we can conclude that our results appear in broad agreement with those by @xcite at small angular scales . on the other side ,",
    "we obtain a steeper slope of the _ acf _  at large angular scales , suggesting the possible presence of a contribution from other components in their data .",
    "in this section we focus on the properties of oxygen emission . in particular , we study the expected surface brightness due to ovii  and oviii  that represent the ions with the most significant contribution at x - ray energies .    to this purpose",
    "we take advantage of our method for computing the spectra associated to the sph particles described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spec ] ) that allows us to separate the emission from the different elements .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sub : coneset ] , we use the last two light - cones set listed in table  [ tab : cones ] , which were computed with an energy resolution of 1  ev necessary for the analysis of single line emission . the energy range considered here ( 0.31 kev )",
    "allows us to enclose all of the most important ovii  and oviii  lines up to @xmath34 , with no significant contribution from ovi . in order to save memory , these o emission spectra",
    "have been computed with a poorer angular resolution of @xmath161 arcmin , but this does not introduce any systematics since the expected correlation of the igm and whim signal does not rise significantly at lower angular scales ( see section  [ sub : acf ] ) .",
    "moreover the expected angular resolution of the next - generation spectrographs ( e.g. , the _",
    "ixo / athena _ proposal ) is higher than this limit .",
    "an example of a whim spectrum computed with our method for both oxygen - line and continuum emission is shown in fig .  [ fig : speco ] .",
    "we compute the statistics of the expected number of o lines ( ovii  and oviii  added together ) above a given surface brightness along the line of sight .",
    "we proceed in the following way . for a given pixel of our maps , that corresponds to a line - of - sight of 0.88 arcmin@xmath35 and extending in the range @xmath36",
    ", we consider its spectrum in the energy interval 0.31 kev and identify the 1  ev bins corresponding to a surface brightness higher than a threshold fixed to sb@xmath37 ph s@xmath38 @xmath39 deg@xmath40  ( safely below the detection limits of future instruments ) .",
    "then , since an emission line can extend to more than 1  ev , we assign to a single line all the contiguous bins that fall above this threshold and sum their values to obtain the total surface brightness of the line itself .",
    "we repeat the same procedure for all the pixels and all the 20 different light - cones for both the igm and the whim .",
    "we checked that the final results do not change significantly when degrading our angular resolution to @xmath162  arcmin or when changing the value of sb@xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : olines ] shows the expected number counts of oxygen lines for our reference run compared with the other ones .",
    "when considering the different simulation parameters ( top panel ) we see that increasing the mass resolution of the simulation by a factor of @xmath164 enhances the expected line counts for the igm by @xmath1620 per cent .",
    "this is due to improved capability of resolving the high density regions that host the star - forming metal - rich gas and are therefore bright line - emitters .",
    "the effect is also present when considering the whim oxygen lines in the faint ( sb @xmath42 ph s@xmath38 @xmath39 deg@xmath40 ) end .",
    "this suggests that a high resolution is mandatory in this kind of analysis and is more desirable than a large simulation volume .",
    "the different imfs ( central panel ) produce changes in the amount of sn - ii and , consequently , on the total amount of oxygen released by stars . with the top - heavy @xcite imf ( way model )",
    "the increased amount of sn - ii produces significantly more oxygen .",
    "if we take as a reference a surface brightness detection threshold of 3@xmath43 ph s@xmath38 @xmath39 deg@xmath40  ( a possible goal of next - generation instruments ) , this translates into @xmath1620 per cent more detected lines for both igm and whim .",
    "the opposite effect happens when adopting the @xcite imf ( ws ) .",
    "the changes introduced by different feedback schemes ( bottom panel ) are also relevant .",
    "when suppressing galactic winds ( nw ) metals remain more concentrated in the cold star - forming regions where they are not able to emit significantly : this results in a factor of 2 less expected lines for the igm .",
    "the cw model shows trend for the igm similar to the w model , with a small increase for fainter lines .",
    "when looking at the whim curves , the effect of metal transport due to galactic winds can be seen with the higher amount of lines expected with respect to the nw model , that reaches an order of magnitude for brighter ( sb@xmath44 ph s@xmath38 @xmath39 deg@xmath40 ) lines .",
    "coupled winds are not able to diffuse efficiently metals in the low density regions , resulting in a number of lines closer to the nw run than to the w one .",
    "considering the bh feedback , the expected line counts are significantly smaller for both igm and whim .",
    "again , this is the result of the early energy feedback that suppresses the gas collapse resulting in the igm having less dense structures .",
    "this effect is even more remarkable in the whim .",
    "apart from the differences introduced by the various feedback mechanisms , we can compare the results of our reference run with the expected oxygen line counts estimated by @xcite and @xcite . on the whole ,",
    "the number of oxygen lines that we estimate is significantly lower with respect to their results .",
    "if we consider the b1 model of @xcite and a reference surface brightness of 0.1 ph s@xmath38 @xmath39 sr@xmath38 , they obtain a value of @xmath45 for the sum of ovii  and oviii  lines in the igm case and @xmath46 for the whim .",
    "since their redshift interval is @xmath47 here we consider that the contribution from lines associated to higher redshift emitters is negligible .",
    "] , while our reference model predicts 0.5 and 0.25 respectively , a factor 34 lower . as a consequence , with our results the amount of whim emission lines detectable by future x - ray instruments",
    "is significantly reduced .",
    "if we consider a resolution element of 2.6 arcmin , our w model predicts @xmath16100 detections per square degree of either ovii  or oviii  lines from the whim .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy has to be searched in the different recipe adopted to describe the metal enrichment of the gas . @xcite",
    "adopt a post - processing method assigning a metallicity to the sph particles as a function of overdensity : in particular , they use the results of @xcite who estimated a relation of the form @xmath48 .",
    "if we compare it to what was shown in @xcite we can see that this results in a factor of @xmath49 less metals at overdensities @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to that , if we take into account also the differences in the relative element abundance , our model presents a o / fe mass ratio of @xmath51 while @xcite adopt solar yields from @xcite which correspond to a mass ratio of 5.2 .",
    "this adds another difference by a factor of 2 in the abundance of oxygen . at a first approximation ,",
    "given the linear dependence of line emissivity on the element abundance , this translates into a factor of @xmath164 in line surface brightness that is sufficient to explain the differences with their work . in order to verify this hypothesis",
    "we run a test light - cone implementing their @xmath52 relation and , as expected , we obtained results similar to @xcite",
    ".    we can also compare our results with @xcite who computed the expected oxygen lines by using a hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "even if they provide only the value of @xmath53 at @xmath54 , we can estimate that our numbers are smaller , coherently to what said about @xcite .",
    "again , part of the difference is due to the different element yields : @xcite artificially augment the oxygen abundance of their model ( see the discussion in their section 2 ) to reach a value of o / fe close to 2 times solar .",
    "such a high value is ruled out by current estimates from observed galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , their simulation is able to spread more efficiently the metals outside the hot and dense regions , resulting in more oxygen in the thermodynamical conditions that correspond to bright ovii  and oviii  emission .",
    "this issue is connected to the current uncertainties in the hydrodynamical codes and particularly in the feedback implementation .",
    "more in detail , it has been shown that introducing a coupled winds scheme on simulations at galactic scales can impact galactic properties as well as the amount of ejected material @xcite .",
    "moreover also the implementation of momentum - driven winds in hydrodynamical simulations can modify the star - formation history and increase the amount of metals ejected at earlier epochs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , given the complex interplay between wind efficiency and star formation regulation , it is difficult to determine whether these models might reduce the discrepancy between our results and the ones of @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "an interesting comparison can be provided by estimates from ovi  absorption systems that are , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations presented in @xcite that include a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment of the igm .",
    "the aim is to provide a description of the expected x - ray emission of the whim , with focus on the influence of different feedback mechanisms , namely initial mass functions , galactic winds and black hole feedback .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* galactic winds have a strong impact on the expected signal of the whim and the igm in general : with our assumptions ( @xmath55 km / s , @xmath56 ) the surface brightness is enhanced by a factor of 2 through all the energy range of interest ( 0.310 kev ) .",
    "this is due to the ability of winds to push gas and metals in cluster outskirts and outside , making lower density regions brighter .",
    "* on the other side bhs , acting at earlier epochs , can prevent the igm to collapse in dense structures suppressing significantly the expected emission of clusters and whim . *",
    "all of our models predict that the expected contribution from non - resolved lss structures ( galaxy groups , whim ) is below the upper limits of the uxrb @xcite . at energies",
    "@xmath14 kev they account for only @xmath16 10 per cent of the uxrb , indicating that galactic components dominate , while at @xmath15 kev , they account from half to all of the signal , with significant field - to - field differences expected due to cosmic variance .",
    "* the whim shows an angular correlation function @xmath57 up to scales of 2 - 3 arcmin , with very low variations due to feedback effects or cosmic variance . at low angular scales ( @xmath58 arcmin ) ,",
    "our results are in broad agreement with the observations of @xcite , while for larger angles we obtain lower values . * the expected oxygen ( ovii  and oviii ) line counts depend significantly on the choice of the feedback models . in particular , the number of detectable line counts is increased by a factor of 3 by gws and by 20 per cent when assuming a top - heavy imf @xcite .",
    "we obtain also a significant enhancement by increasing the mass resolution of the simulation . * with our simulations",
    "we predict a number of detectable oxygen emission lines lower by a factor of 3 - 4 with respect to the predictions of other works @xcite due to differences in the implementation of chemical enrichment in the hydrodynamical codes .",
    "this has to be subject of further investigations and has to be considered a part of current uncertainties in the modelisation of the whim properties .",
    "however , if our results were confirmed , observing o lines from the whim might be a difficult task even for the upcoming x - ray observatories .    as a conclusion ,",
    "our work confirms the importance of the use of hydrodynamical simulations in the modelisation of the lss properties , together with the comparison with observations .",
    "in particular , we highlighted how the new generation of x - ray telescopes could provide constraints on both the missing baryon component and the mechanisms of star - formation and feedback that affect the whim . in this framework",
    ", it will be interesting to extend the results of our work also to the absorption properties in the x - ray and uv frequency range .",
