    "the decision regions @xmath6 are the subsets of the signal space @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of codewords .",
    "the decision boundaries are all the points for which exists @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "the decision boundaries divide the signal space into @xmath9 disjoint decision regions , each of which consists of all the point in @xmath7 closest in euclidian distance to the received signal @xmath12 .",
    "an ml decoder finds which decision region @xmath13 contains @xmath12 , and outputs the corresponding codeword @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of pseudocodewords in bp and lp decoders divides the signal space into more decision regions than those created solely by codewords .",
    "clearly , these pseudocodewords reduce the decision regions of the codewords , hence deteriorate the decoder optimality .",
    "the first step towards mapping the decision regions is to decide of the two spanning vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "these two vectors must be orthogonal in order to have a clear 2-dimensional picture , rather than a folded one .",
    "the sum of these two vectors is the noise vector that is added to the transmitted signal .",
    "the noisy samples are then decoded , and the output of the decoder is recorded along with the received signal .",
    "all the received signals which share the same output designate a decision region . in the following the lp decoder uses a @xmath18 polytope @xcite under a binary - input memoryless symmetric channel , thus one may assume without loss of generality that the all - zero codeword was transmitted . for bp and ml decoders , the conditional decoding error probability is independent of the codeword that was sent .",
    "therefore , our analysis will assume that the all - zero codeword was transmitted over an awgn channel using a bpsk modulation .",
