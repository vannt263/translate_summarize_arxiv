    "first , the incoming photon excites the electronic state of pigments in the antenna complex of the photosystem .",
    "then the excited state energy will be transported to the reaction center of the photosystem .",
    "when enough excitation energy has been collected , a charge separation will be triggered by one or a pair of bacteriochlorophylls ( bchls ) at the reaction center ; this will further induce an electron transfer via an electron transport chain and generate a proton gradient across the membrane .",

    "the most well - studied systems are the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex of green sulfur bacteria and the lh2 complex of purple bacteria .",
    "the fmo complex transfers the exciton energy from the light harvesting complex to the reaction center ( rc ) , thus plays the role of an intermediate candidate which passes the exciton energy with an efficiency of almost 100% @xcite .",

    "the beating time of the population oscillation lasts roughly 150 fs .",
    "the populations of s2 , s5 and s10 evolves to their first maximum value at 13 , 35 and 66 fs respectively .",
    "compared with the previous , non - dissipative case , these maxima are achieved simultaneously , which indicates the population oscillation of lh2 is due to the system itself rather than the environment .",
    "the environment plays a role in destroying the population beating , which is analogous to that in the fmo complex @xcite .",
    "however , the population amplitude of each site and beating time are both smaller when compared to the fmo complex .",
    "this is reasonable since lh2 is much larger than the fmo complex .",
    "in contrast with the non - dissipative situation , the populations of all sites evolve to their equilibrium state during the time evolution . furthermore , the difference for the peak arrival time also becomes larger as the evolution continues .",
    "it shows that the environment not only affects the population distribution but also facilitates the propagation speed of these exciton waves .",
    "the system arrives at the thermal equilibrium at 400 fs when @xmath78 . due to the symmetry of the system , all odd - number sites will finally equilibrate to the same population and similarly with even sites .",
    "when two wave packets first reach s10 , the local maximal population is about 1.6 times that of the first local maximum of the s5 and s15 populations , and the time variance of this peak increases as well . although the system is highly symmetric , the coupling between sites is non - trivial and makes the oscillation pattern complex , which is quite different than in the fmo system .",
    "using another initial condition ( s2 fully excited ) , we found that in the non - dissipative case ( fig .",

    "[ fig:300k_population_s2](b ) ) , the amplitude of the first population maximum of adjacent sites corresponds to the strength of coupling .",
    "since the coupling between bchls in the same dimer is stronger than that between 2 bchls of different dimers , larger population can be found in the bchl in the same dimer .",

    "( b ) @xmath93 fs , when s10 has its maximum population .",
    "( c ) @xmath94 fs , when both exciton wave packets traverse through about the whole ring .",
    "( d ) @xmath88 fs , the system is in a nearly equilibrated state . ]",
    "in summary , we employed the scaled hierarchical equation of motion ( heom ) , which has been proved to be computationally more efficient @xcite , in studying the population and the coherence evolution of the lh2 b850 for both cryogenic ( @xmath95 ) and physiological ( @xmath78 ) temperatures .",
    "moreover , the short - time dynamics and the thermal equilibration of excitation energy transfer within the ring are systematically investigated by visualizing the reduced density operator .",
    "similar to the situation for the fmo complex , there are both population and coherence oscillations during the time evolution in the lh2 system . in addition",
    ", the oscillation time for population and coherence is almost the same for the same system .",
    "high temperatures shorten the coherence time and suppress both oscillation amplitude of coherence and population .",
    "however , the beating time for lh2 can last 150 fs and 300 fs at physiological and cryogenic temperatures , respectively .",
    "this is much shorter compared with the fmo complex ( coherence oscillation can last 400 and 650 fs at the same temperature ) . besides this , the exciton packet transfer both clockwise and counterclockwise during the evolution for lh2 system .",
    "the period for exciton transferred is 128 , 127 and 124 fs for the non - dissipative , cryogenic and physiological temperature situations ; this indicates that the high temperature increases the propagation speed of the exciton wave packet .",
    "moreover , although the coherence oscillation vanishes rapidly , the coherence between adjacent bchls revives and remains in the system for a long time , which is consistent with the result of 2d electronic spectroscopy from other experimental studies .",
    "this phenomenon may give us some clues about coherence could be maintained in such a noisy environment and may shed a light on designing a quantum system which can preserve coherence at room temperature .",
    "recently , the optimized heom coupled with the drude spectral density has been proposed @xcite , which improves the efficiency in numerical calculations .",
    "it will be our future task to apply this approach to the current model for simulating larger systems , such as the lh2 b800-b850 .",
