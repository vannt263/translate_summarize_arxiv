    "polymers and charge - transfer salts are examples for almost ideal one - dimensional materials ( farges 1994 ) . besides their potential technological applications these systems play an important test ground for our theoretical understanding of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in low dimensions .",
    "the theoretical study of the corresponding one - dimensional models instead of their three - dimensional counterparts has the further advantage that much larger systems can be handled numerically , and some of the conceptually simplest can even be solved analytically .    if one wants to show that a model is indeed appropriate for a real material one has to calculate experimentally accessible quantities .",
    "analytical calculations often require the introduction of further ( uncontrolled ) approximations while the analysis of data from numerical approaches is hampered by finite size effects .",
    "this makes the assessment of the model quality a difficult task .",
    "even if a model can be solved without resorting to uncontrolled approximations the interpretation and relevance of the results for real materials remains a matter of debate .",
    "theoretical investigations concentrate on ideal systems , e.g. , infinitely extended and perfectly homogeneous , that can not be made in practice .",
    "thus it should be kept in mind that experimental results may dominantly show effects of disorder and interactions with the chain environment which are usually neglected in theoretical approaches .    despite these conceptual problems",
    "the analysis of basic models remains the first task to be accomplished in theory . in principle",
    ", models will differ in their experimental predictions which will allow to discriminate between them .",
    "in addition , model parameters are usually fitted by comparison with experiment .",
    "it is widely believed that polyacetylene and other polymers are basically described by independent electrons coupled to a linear chain of atoms ( heeger , kievelson , schrieffer and su 1988 ) ; ( baeriswyl , campbell and mazumdar 1992 ) ; ( schott and nechtschein 1994 ) . for a fixed lattice distortion",
    "the generic model is the dimerized tight - binding ( or hckel ) model .",
    "the optical absorption for this independent free electron model was already addressed in the past ( baeriswyl , harbeke , kiess , meier , and meyer 1983 ) ; ( abe 1993 ) . in this work",
    "we comprehensively derive analytical expressions for the dipole matrix elements and the optical absorption in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "in contrast to previous works we take special care of the derivation of the current and the dipole operator .",
    "some charge - transfer salts are understood as strongly correlated one - dimensional electron systems for half - filled bands ( mott - hubbard insulators ) ( alccer , brau , and farges 1994 ) . the extended hubbard model for interacting electrons on a distorted chain at half - filling",
    "is considered appropriate for these materials ( mazumdar and dixit 1986 ) ; ( fritsch and ducasse 1991 ) ; ( mila 1995 ) . the theoretical study of these model systems is subject to two forthcoming articles ( gebhard , bott , scheidler , thomas , and koch 1996 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ hamiltpei ]",
    "we set up the hamiltonian and diagonalize it . in section  [ currentop ]",
    "we determine the current operator for tight - binding electrons on a peierls - distorted chain .",
    "we show that the distortion gives rise to correction terms that have been neglected in the literature . in section  [ appeleccurr ]",
    "we derive the standard formulae for the optical conductivity . in section  [ peierlssec ]",
    "we present explicit expressions for the optical absorption of free , independent tight - binding electrons moving on a peierls - dimerized chain at half band - filling . in section  [ appdipole ]",
    "we show how to derive the results via perturbation theory using the regular part of the electrical dipole operator .",
    "this approach is often preferred in semiconductor optics for the perturbational treatment of the external field .",
    "a summary closes our presentation .",
    "free , non - interacting spin-1/2 electrons in a _ single _ band do not show optical absorption at finite frequencies because excitations with vanishing momentum necessarily have vanishing energy .",
    "all the optical conductivity is thus concentrated in the drude weight at zero frequency .",
    "hence , interactions must be included to obtain absorption at finite frequencies .    in highly anisotropic ,",
    "quasi one - dimensional systems the lattice is unstable against a static ( peierls-)distortion at low temperatures since the gain in electron kinetic energy due to the distortion overcomes the lattice deformation energy .",
    "we assume that an electron transfer can take place between neighboring atoms only ( tight - binding approximation ) .",
    "furthermore , the wave vector of the lattice distortion ,  @xmath4 , is taken commensurate with the electron filling , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6  is the lattice spacing of the undimerized chain .",
    "this implies that we address the half - filled case where the number of lattice sites  @xmath7 equals the number of electrons , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    under these assumptions",
    "the electrons are described by a dimerized tight - binding model , @xmath10 here , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for an electron of spin  @xmath13 in a wannier orbital centered at site  @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 describes the effect of the bond - length alternation on the electron transfer amplitudes .",
    "it implies  @xmath16 , and @xmath17 if one denotes the hopping amplitudes for the long ( short ) bond by  @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . usually , one supposes an exponential dependence of the electron transfer amplitudes on the distance  @xmath20 between sites , @xmath21 . for @xmath22 ,",

    "note that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are always opposite in sign .",
    "as usual the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in momentum space .",

    "only a frequency dependent field will be considered in the following . in general , a one - dimensional system shall be described by a time - independent hamilton operator .",
    "optical excitations are created by the time - dependent perturbation ( maldague 1977 ) ; ( mahan 1990 ) @xmath60 which couples the external vector potential @xmath61 to the current operator  @xmath62 of the system ( @xmath63  is the speed of light ) .",
    "it is not trivial to derive the current operator for a dimerized system .",
    "we choose the coulomb gauge and set the scalar potential to zero .",

    "the electrical field can be taken constant over lattice distances since we are interested in optical excitations in the regime of electron volts .",
    "these energies are small compared to atomic energies , and the corresponding wave vectors are small compared to typical electron momenta .",

    ". now that the vector field is along the chain we can write @xmath75 this is the well - known peierls substitution .",
    "note that we tacitly _ assumed _ that the wannier wave functions remain undistorted albeit the atoms come closer to or farther away from each other due to the distortion .",
    "this implies @xmath76 as a requirement for the validity of the tight - binding approximation",
    ". otherwise the atomic wave functions will be deformed which will ultimately result in a bi - atomic , molecular structure . in a dimerized system the distances between neighboring sites",

    "formally , we may allow @xmath78 to check our results . on physical grounds we have to require @xmath79 to be consistent with the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the small value @xmath80 in polyacetylen ( baeriswyl , campbell , and mazumdar 1992 ) ; ( schott and nechtschein 1994 ) indicates that in real materials the corrections due to the @xmath2-terms will dominate those due to wannier function deformations .",
    "the latter corrections should be exponentially small for small @xmath81-values since the wave functions themselves decay exponentially as function of distance from the lattice site .",
    "the hamiltonian depends on the external field via the field dependent hopping amplitudes .",

    "<S> in this first of three articles on the optical absorption of electrons in half - filled peierls - distorted chains we present analytical results for non - interacting tight - binding electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully derive explicit expressions for the current operator , the dipole transition matrix elements , and the optical absorption for electrons with a cosine dispersion relation of band width  @xmath0 and dimerization parameter  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> new correction ( `` @xmath2''-)terms to the current operator are identified . </S>",
    "<S> a broad band - to - band transition is found in the frequency range @xmath3 whose shape is determined by the joint density of states for the upper and lower peierls subbands and the strong momentum dependence of the transition matrix elements .    </S>",
