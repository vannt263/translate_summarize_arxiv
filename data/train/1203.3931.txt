    "spin dynamics in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) has been intensively investigated in recent years due to the fast development of semiconductor spintronics.@xcite in iii - v zinc - blende qw systems , spin relaxation is mainly determined by the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism,@xcite which results from the momentum scattering together with the momentum - dependent effective magnetic field induced by the dresselhaus@xcite and/or rashba@xcite spin - orbit couplings ( socs ) .",
    "so far , most studies focus on the @xmath1@xcite and @xmath2 qws.@xcite in these works , many efforts have been devoted to obtain a long spin relaxation time ( srt).@xcite in @xmath1 qws , when the strengths of the dresselhaus and rashba terms are comparable , electron spin relaxation along the @xmath3 $ ] or @xmath4 $ ] direction can be strongly suppressed.@xcite for @xmath2 symmetric qws , the effective magnetic field due to the dresselhaus term is oriented along the growth direction , which leads to an absent dp relaxation for electron spins along this direction.@xcite    recently , some attention has been devoted to @xmath5 qws where electron spin relaxation also shows rich properties.@xcite cartoix _",
    "et al._@xcite pointed out that to the first order in the momentum , the effective magnetic field from both the dresselhaus and rashba terms @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] ) , can be suppressed to zero by setting the rashba coefficient @xmath10 to cancel with the dresselhaus coefficient @xmath11 and hence the dp spin relaxation becomes absent for all three spin components .",
    "however , this strict cancellation can not occur due to the existence of the cubic dresselhaus term @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "et al._@xcite showed that with this cubic term included , the cancellation occurs only for the in - plane effective magnetic field on a special momentum circle , which may lead to a peak in the density or temperature dependence of the srt .",

    "@xcite measured the gate - voltage dependence of the srt and a two - order of magnitude increase of the srt can be observed , reaching values larger than @xmath13ns by applying an external electric field of @xmath14kv / cm along the growth direction of the qw .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are still no reports on hole spin relaxation in ( 111 ) zinc - blende qws .    in the present work",

    "this cancellation leads to a strong suppression of the in - plane inhomogeneous broadening@xcite and hence an extremely long srt for spins along the growth direction .",
    "it is further noted that although the out - of - plane component of the effective magnetic field of the lowest hh subband can also be suppressed to zero , the cancellation gate voltage @xmath27 ( about @xmath28kv / cm ) is too large to realize .",

    "we calculate the hole spin relaxation by the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite with all the relevant scatterings explicitly included .",
