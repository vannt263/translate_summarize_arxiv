    "our conclusion that @xmath122 galaxies can account for the planck @xmath2 relies on extrapolating lfs below observed limits and a higher escape fraction than at lower redshift . if galaxies are less efficient ionizers , more @xmath14 star formation would be permitted .",
    "however , @xcite already demonstrated such an ionizing efficiency is required to maintain a highly ionized igm at @xmath123 ( figure [ fig : qhi ] ) .",

    "this provides the first empirical limit on models that increase the ionizing efficiency during this epoch e.g. with massive population iii stars and star formation in mini - halos ( see @xcite for an overview of such models ) .",
    "our results suggest such models can not dramatically change the star formation efficiency at the earliest times .",
    "reionization proceeds relatively quickly as the ionized fraction evolves from @xmath128 to @xmath129 in only @xmath130 of cosmic history over @xmath131 .",
