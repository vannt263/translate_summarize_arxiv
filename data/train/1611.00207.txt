    "distributed time delays arise in models for a variety of applications including population dynamics @xcite , blood cell dynamics @xcite , neuronal models @xcite , and coupled oscillators @xcite . although many of these models include only a single time delay , this often results from some simplification in the model set up . as an example",

    ", we will investigate the stability of the trivial solution of by adopting direct analysis of the associated characteristic equation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ delay - independent - stability ] , we formulate some necessary distribution - independent conditions for stability of the trivial solution . in section  [ generation - mechanism ] , we describe some distribution - specific mechanisms by which bifurcation curves evolve in an appropriate parameter space , and how this has an effect on the region of stability . section  [ number - of - roots - with - real - part ] discusses how stability changes as bifurcation curves are traversed in the parameter space characterised by @xmath16 and the mean delay of @xmath17 .",
