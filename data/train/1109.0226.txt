    "phases of matters in condensed matter systems can almost always be characterized by the landau - ginzburg symmetry breaking theory@xcite .",
    "experimental discovery of integer and fractional quantum hall states in 2-d electron gas under a strong external magnetic field@xcite has provided striking counter examples of this paradigm .",
    "the fractional quantum hall liquids are particularly fascinating in the sense that their low energy excitations are quasi - particles carrying fractional electric charge@xcite and obeying anyonic statistics@xcite .",
    "although these liquid phases do not break physical symmetries , they are still different quantum phases .",
    "one measurable difference is their edge states : despite the fact that these liquids are all insulators in the bulk , they all possess certain edge metallic modes@xcite . in general different bulk phases host different edge states which can be detected by various experimental probes such as electric transport@xcite .",
    "a few years after the experimental discovery of integer quantum hall effect(iqhe ) , haldane showed that the essence of it is _ not _ the external magnetic field@xcite , by explicitly writing down a lattice model hamiltonian of iqhe with zero net magnetic field .",
    "however , it takes more than two decades for people to show that similar statement is true even for fqhe .",
    "recently results from a series of model studies@xcite , including convincing evidences from exact diagonalizations@xcite , indicate that fractional quantum hall states exist in the ground states of interacting lattice models , in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "it is found that the ground state is likely to respect the full lattice symmetry .",
    "here we call these fractional ground states spin - polarized `` fractional chern insulators '' ( fci ) to distinguish from the traditional fractional quantum hall states in an external magnetic field .",
    "these proposed lattice models share a common feature : a partially filled nearly flat two - dimensional band with non - trivial band topology .",
    "the concept of band topology originates from the well - known tknn index ( or chern number ) of an iqh insulator@xcite . in the past few years",
    ", this concept has been generalized to time - reversal symmetric systems , and triggers the theoretical and experimental discoveries of topological insulators in spin - orbital coupled compounds in both two and three spatial dimensions@xcite . in two dimension ( 2d ) ,",
    "a time - reversal symmetric band insulator is characterized by a @xmath7 topological index .",
    "experimentally , hgte quantum heterostructure has been shown to be a 2d topological insulator@xcite . in the simplest limit",
    ", 2d topological insulator can be viewed as a direct product of the up - spin and down - spin wavefunctions hosting opposite tknn index .",
    "it is then quite natural to ask whether similar time - reversal - invariant ( tri ) versions of two - dimensional fractional topological insulators ( fti ) exist or not , and there has been a lot of interest in this issue@xcite . in the simplest limit",
    "when spin along the @xmath8-direction is conserved , it can be understood as the direct product of wavefunctions of the up spin and the down spin with opposite fqhe .",
    "clearly this direct product is a fully gapped stable phase .",
    "in addition it must have non - trivial ground state degeneracy on a torus even in the presence of a small @xmath9 conservation breaking perturbation , because the ground state degeneracy can not be lifted by an arbitrary local perturbation .",
    "so there is no question that in principle this fractionalized phase could exist .",
    "one important issue is whether this phase hosts stable gapless edge excitations .",
    "this problem has been studied in by levin and stern@xcite .",
    "another important open question is that whether tri fti can exist in a reasonable hamiltonian .    in order to realize the fci or fti phases in experiments",
    ", one should find a compound with a nearly flat topological non - trivial band so that correlation effect is strong . naively this is unnatural because usually a flat band is realized by spatially localized orbitals which do not support topological non - trivial hopping terms .",
    "however , a very recent theoretical investigation@xcite on transition metal oxide heterostructures indicates that a nearly flat topological non - trivial band can be naturally realized in the @xmath10 orbital double - layer perovskite grown along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "exact diagonalization in the same work shows that fractional quantum hall state can be realized in principle when the nearly flat band is partially filled .",
    "because the temperature scale of the fci / fti physics in this system is controlled by short - range coulomb interaction , it can be a high - temperature effect .",
    "fractional quantum hall states , especially the non - abelian ones , have been shown to be very useful building blocks of quantum computers .",
    "if high temperature fci / fti physics can be realized experimentally , it will certainly have deep impact in condensed matter physics , including the efforts on topological quantum computation@xcite .",
    "motivated by the recent progresses on fci / fti physics , in this paper we try to address several important issues : _ what are the many - particle wavefunctions of 2-d fcis / ftis ?",
    "can there be more than one fci / fti phases with the same filling fraction ?",
    "if the answer is positive , can we classify these quantum phases ( or ground state wavefunctions ) ?",
    "_    historically , laughlin s wavefunctions of fqh states in a magnetic field@xcite have been shown to be one of the most important theoretical progresses in many - particle physics .",
    "it allows people to understand a lot of properties of fqh liquids in a compact fashion , including the fractionalized quasi - particle excitations@xcite , topological ground state degeneracies@xcite , as well as constructing the low energy effective theories@xcite . here in the case of fci / fti systems ,",
    "analytical understanding of the ground state wavefunctions will help us extract various measurable information in a similar way .",
    "recently there was an interesting work to construct fci wavefunctions by proposing a one - to - one mapping between the lattice problem and the magnetic field problem@xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the wavefunction problem for fci is related to that for the magnetic field case , yet they are very different from each other .",
    "this is because the lattice symmetry of fci is fundamentally different from the continuum case of the 2-d electron gas .",
    "in fact , the recently discovered fci states preserve all the lattice point group symmetry as well as translational symmetry . here in this paper , we point out that as a consequence of the lattice symmetry , there exist many different quantum fci phases , all respecting the full lattice symmetry , even at the same filling fraction with the same quantum hall conductance .",
    "these different fci phases are distinct in the bulk in a more subtle way .",
    "one hand - waving statement is that the bulk quasi - particle excitations of these phases carry different lattice quantum numbers .",
    "these distinct fci phases can not be adiabatically connected with each other without a phase transition while the lattice symmetry is respected .",
    "similar phenomena of distinct topologically ordered phases protected by symmetry is known in the context of quantum spin liquids@xcite and other low dimensional topological phases@xcite .",
    "now we outline the content of this paper .",
    "we start with the spin - polarized fci at filling @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is an odd number ) . in section [ parton ]",
    "the @xmath3 parton construction of the fractional quantum hall states ( or spin - polarized fci states ) is introduced on a lattice , which is a natural generalization of the continuum case@xcite .",
    "we argue that a general fci wavefunction could break the @xmath3 gauge group down to @xmath4 , and consequently the low - energy dynamics is described by chern - simons - higgs theories .",
    "we explicitly write down the form of the electronic fci wavefunctions which will be useful for future variational monte carlo study .",
    "we construct quasiparticle excitations of such fci states . to demonstrate how lattice symmetry restricts the structure of the wavefunctions , we introduce the concept of projective symmetry group ( psg)@xcite which serves as the mathematical language to classify different symmetry protected fci phases .    with these theoretical preparations , in section [ example ]",
    "we discuss one particular example , _",
    "i.e.  _ the checkerboard lattice model@xcite and write down two @xmath3 fci wavefunctions and two @xmath4 fci wavefunctions in distinct universality classes for @xmath13 .",
    "these wavefunctions support the same @xmath14 quantized hall conductance and similar topological properties .",
    "they are characterized by different psgs in the bulk .",
    "these states can all serve as candidate states for the fci state found in numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "which state is realized in the simulated model@xcite would be determined by energetics . because our proposed wavefunctions has the form of a slater determinant and",
    "can be effectively implemented by variational monte carlo approach , the energetics of the proposed states can be studied by future numerical investigation . in appendix",
    "[ app : example : honeycomb ] we present another four examples of distinct fci phases in the honeycomb lattice model@xcite : two are @xmath3 states and the other two are @xmath4 states .",
    "we also propose spin - polarized fci states with non - abelian quasiparticles , which might be realized in nearly flat bands with chern number @xmath15 .",
    "such non - abelian fcis might be used to build a universal quantum computer@xcite .    in section [ eft",
    "] we demonstrate that our parton construction can be used to compute the topological ground state degeneracy .",
    "this is particularly important for the @xmath4 states , which belong to a new class of fqh wavefunctions .    in section [ fti ]",
    "we generalize our efforts to construct ground state wavefunctions of tri ftis .",
    "when the mixing between the up and down spins is weak in the electronic hamiltonian , it is natural to generalize our spin polarized results to this case . for filling fraction @xmath16 ( on average @xmath11 for each spin ) ,",
    "we present classes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 wavefunctions and discuss their properties including quasi - particle statistics and ground state degeneracies .",
    "we also propose a new parton construction formalism which allows one to write down generic electron wavefunctions for tri fti states in the absence of spin conservation .",
    "we can deform such a generic tri fti wavefunction in the absence of spin conservation into a @xmath19-conserved tri fti wavefunction ( where spin-@xmath20 and spin-@xmath21 decouple ) by continuously tuning a parameter .",
    "stability of such a state against perturbations are briefly discussed .",
    "soon after the experimental discovery of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effects@xcite , laughlin proposed a series of variational wavefunctions@xcite which were shown@xcite numerically to be a very good description of fqh states at odd - denominator filling fraction @xmath22 .",
    "later this idea of constructing trial wavefunctions was generalized to other filling fractions@xcite .",
    "an important lesson we can learn from laughlin s wavefunction is as follows . with a fixed filling fraction ( or a fixed number of flux quanta through the sample ) , the many - body wavefunction tends to vanish as fast as possible when two electrons approach each other so that the repulsive coulomb energy between electrons could be minimized . as an example , laughlin s state at @xmath13 is nothing but the cube of the wavefunction for a filled lowest landau level .",
    "we can construct this wavefunction by splitting an electron into three fermionic _ partons _ :",
    "@xmath23 naturally from ( [ electron:1/3 ] ) we can see each parton carries @xmath24 electric charge @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the electron charge .",
    "the electron wavefunction is obtained through the following projection @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the parton vacuum and @xmath29 can be any mean - field state of the three partons @xmath30 .",
    "when each of the three partons occupy the lowest landau level ( lll ) one immediately obtains the laughlin s state @xmath31 ^ 3=\\prod_{i < j}(z_i - z_j)^3\\exp[-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|z_i|^2/(4l_b^2)]$ ] .",
    "we have chosen the disc geometry and the symmetric gauge .",
    "@xmath32 are complex coordinates , @xmath33 is the electron magnetic length and @xmath34 is the parton magnetic length .",
    "since each kind of parton occupies a lll , the electro - magnetic response of the fqh state @xmath31 ^ 3 $ ] is characterized by hall conductivity @xmath35 .",
    "this reproduces the correct filling fraction and the many - body chern number .",
    "note that electron operator @xmath36 in ( [ electron:1/3 ] ) is invariant under any _ local _ @xmath37 transformation on the three partons @xmath38 . the mean - field hamiltonian density describing the laughlin state is@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective mass of each parton .",
    "this mean - field hamiltonian preserves the @xmath37 gauge symmetry and partons will also couple to a @xmath37 internal gauge field .",
    "its effective theory is the @xmath41 chern - simons gauge theory , which explains the 3-fold topological ground state degeneracy on a torus@xcite .",
    "these @xmath42 partons are nothing but charge @xmath43 quasiparticle excitations@xcite of laughlin state .",
    "indeed after projection ( [ projection:1/3 ] ) the three species of partons @xmath30 becomes indistinguishable thanks to the internal @xmath37 symmetry : each @xmath44 parton creates a charge @xmath45 quasihole upon acting on the ground state @xmath29 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the following wavefunction @xmath46 reproduces the laughlin wavefunction with three quasiholes at @xmath47 up to a constant factor .",
    "hence these partons are indeed charge @xmath43 anyons obeying fractional statistics with statistical angle @xmath48 .",
    "since the three seemingly - different partons @xmath30 are essentially the same quasihole excitations with the same quantum numbers , physically it is attempting to include the tunneling terms @xmath49 in the mean - field hamiltonian . by mixing different partons",
    ", these terms will break the internal @xmath37 gauge symmetry down to a a subgroup of @xmath37 , which is @xmath50 , the center of the @xmath37 group , in the most generic case where @xmath51 terms are present .",
    "in general the projected @xmath50 wavefunction ( [ projection:1/3 ] ) is different from its parent projected @xmath37 wavefunction . for a 2-d electron gas in a magnetic field , however , people usually focus on the lll within which the many - body wavefunction is an analytic function ( _ e.g .  _ in the symmetric gauge on a disc )",
    ". it is straightforward to show that as long as the mixing terms act inside the hilbert space of lll , the corresponding electron wavefunction ( [ projection:1/3 ] ) for a @xmath50 state remains the same as that of its parent @xmath37 state .",
    "this is because the parton wavefunction describes a state with lll fully filled .",
    "mixing between different partons within the lll hilbert space only gives a unitary transformation of basis and does not modify the parton wavefunction . for a lattice model ,",
    "it is natural to consider mixing terms acting between all bands ( rather than within the filled bands ) , and the corresponding electron wavefunction of a @xmath50 state will be a different wavefunction from that of its parent @xmath37 state . for a filling fraction @xmath22 , our discussion straightforwardly generalizes to the corresponding @xmath4 ( the center of the @xmath3 group ) state and its parent @xmath3 state .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the @xmath4 parton states of fqhe have not been proposed before .",
    "for this new class of wavefunctions , several natural questions need to be answered .",
    "what are the quasi - particles in the @xmath4 state ? what is the low - energy effective theory of the @xmath4 state ? will it preserves the topological properties , such as ground state degeneracy ?",
    "we answer these questions in this paper and find the topological properties of the @xmath4 states are identical to the @xmath3 states .",
    "their difference lies in the projective symmetry group , which is protected by lattice symmetry . in general , @xmath4 states and @xmath3 states both serve as candidate ground states for the fci states of a @xmath22 filled band with chern number one .    to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the quasiparticle excitations in a @xmath4 state .",
    "the physical quasiparticle excitations in a @xmath4 state are constructed by inserting fluxes in the mean - field ansatz of @xmath52 terms and simultaneously creating vortices ( or defects ) in the higgs condensates @xmath53 . in 2-d , because @xmath54 , these defects are the point - like vortices carrying @xmath4 gauge fluxes . because the @xmath4 flux can be considered to be localized in a single plaquette , one can effectively interpret it as a overall @xmath24 gauge flux of all the @xmath44-partons .",
    "namely when a @xmath44-parton winds around a fundamental vortex , it experiences a @xmath55 flux . due to the chern numbers of the filled parton bands",
    ", this vortex also binds with a single @xmath44-parton gauge charge and thus carries electric charge @xmath56 . because this object carries both flux and gauge charge , the fractional statistical angle @xmath57 results .",
    "these are exactly the same electric charge and statistics that a quasiparticle carries in the @xmath3 state .",
    "we conclude that the topological properties of quasiparticles are the same in both the @xmath4 and its @xmath3 parent state .",
    "state on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the dashed line denotes the string of @xmath58 phase shift connecting the two plaquettes where quasiparticle @xmath59 and its antiparticle @xmath60 are located . on top of the ground state mean - field ansatz , any mean - field bond crossing the string should pick up a phase shift @xmath58 .",
    "here we only demonstrate the phase shift of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) mean - field amplitudes by triple arrows in the figure.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    following the above discussions , we can write down the wavefunctions with low - energy anyonic excitations in a @xmath4 state . at filling fraction @xmath22 , in order to create one quasiparticle @xmath59 at @xmath61 and its antiparticle @xmath60 at @xmath62 , we need to insert @xmath63 flux in a plaquette @xmath64 at position @xmath61 and @xmath65 flux in a plaquette @xmath66 at position @xmath62 with @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath59 carries @xmath63 flux and @xmath68 charge while @xmath60 carries @xmath65 flux and @xmath69 charge .",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath60 have statistical angle @xmath70 and their mutual statistical angle is @xmath71 .",
    "they are realized by creating @xmath58 phase shift for all mean - field amplitudes on the string connecting two plaquettes @xmath64 and @xmath66 , on top of the mean - field ansatz for the ground state .",
    "an example of such a pair of quasiparticle and its antiparticle in a @xmath4 state on honeycomb lattice is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp ] .",
    "the corresponding electron wavefunction is obtained by the projection of this new mean - field ansatz to the electronic degrees of freedom . when @xmath72 , this projection is given by eq.([projection:1/3 ] ) .",
    "the ground state degeneracy of a @xmath4 fci state at @xmath22 on a torus can also be understood once we know its quasiparticle statistics@xcite .",
    "consider the following tunneling process @xmath73 : a pair of quasiparticle ( with flux @xmath74 and charge @xmath56 ) and its antiparticle ( with flux @xmath75 and charge @xmath76 ) are created and the quasiparticle is dragged around the non - contractible loop @xmath77 along @xmath78 direction on the torus before it is finally annihilated with it anti - particle .",
    "this tunneling process will leave a string of @xmath79 phase shift ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qp ] ) along this loop @xmath77 , therefore has the same physical effects as adiabatically inserting a @xmath74 flux in the non - contractible loop @xmath80 along @xmath81 direction on the torus . note that when the quasiparticle - anti - quasiparticle pair carries flux @xmath82 and charge @xmath83 the corresponding tunneling process is realized by @xmath84 .",
    "similarly we can define a tunneling process @xmath85 by dragging the fundamental quasiparticle around non - contractible loop @xmath80 once , which is physically equivalent to inserting @xmath74 flux in non - contractible loop @xmath77 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the hilbert space of degenerate ground states should be expanded by these tunneling processes@xcite .",
    "the two tunneling operators satisfy the following  magnetic algebra \" : @xmath86 this is straightforward to understand from the point of view of aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "another way to understand it is because the tunneling process @xmath87 can de continuously deformed into two linked loops@xcite and corresponds to a phase of @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the statistical angle of the fundamental quasiparticle .",
    "all degenerate ground states can be labeled by _",
    "e.g.  _ eigenvalues of unitary operators @xmath73 and @xmath90 ( since they commute with each other ) . in this basis @xmath85 acts like a ladder operator and changes the eigenvalue of @xmath73 by a phase @xmath79 . in this way one can see the ground state degeneracy of a @xmath4 state on torus is @xmath12-fold .",
    "we can easily generalize this discussion to a genius-@xmath91 riemann surface with @xmath91 pairs of non - contractible loops and the corresponding ground state degeneracy is @xmath92-fold .",
    "this is consistent with the ground state degeneracy calculated from the low - energy effective theory as will be shown in section [ eft ] in a formal way .    because the discussion on low - energy effective theory of the @xmath4 state involves more technical details , we postpone it to section [ eft ] , where we compute its ground state degeneracy .",
    "we ll show that the ground state degeneracy of a @xmath4 state is the same as that of a @xmath3 state : @xmath92-fold on a genus-@xmath91 riemann surface .      in the numerical simulations of fci phases@xcite , only the @xmath12-fold topological degeneracy of @xmath22 fci",
    "is observed on torus .",
    "this indicates that the fci wavefunctions respect the full lattice symmetry , since otherwise there should be extra degeneracies due to lattice symmetry breaking .",
    "this motivates us to write down the fully symmetric fci wavefunctions .    in the following we outline the general strategy to construct fully symmetric fci states on a lattice in the parton approach .",
    "here we focus on spin - polarized fci states with filling fraction @xmath22 through the @xmath3 parton construction .",
    "the electron operator is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the coordinate of a lattice site .",
    "for simplicity we assume there is only one orbital per lattice site .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this parton construction has a local @xmath3 symmetry since the electron operator @xmath36 is invariant under any local transformation @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "a generic parton mean - field ansatz is written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a @xmath99 matrix assuming there are one electron orbital per site . under a local @xmath3 gauge transformation",
    "@xmath100 it transforms as @xmath101 .",
    "again once we obtain a mean - field state @xmath29 with the right filling number from ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) , the corresponding electron wavefunction is obtained through @xmath102 whose explicit form is a slater determinant as given later in ( [ wavefunction : zm ] ) .",
    "not all parton mean - field ansatzs correspond to @xmath22 fci states .",
    "let s start from a @xmath3 mean - field state with @xmath103 : @xmath104 where each flavor of the parton has the same filling number as the electron .",
    "for @xmath22 fci states in topological flat bands , the filling fraction is such that on average there is one electron ( hence one parton with each flavor ) per @xmath12 unit cells .",
    "if the mean - field ansatz ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) has explicit lattice translation symmetry , however , the corresponding state with @xmath22 filling would most likely be a gapless metallic state down to @xmath4 , one can construct a gapped state with filling @xmath22 by just filling the lowest parton band , since there is on average one parton ( including all flavors ) in each unit cell .",
    "however , the hall conductance of such a state is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the chern number of lowest parton band .",
    "unless this lowest parton band has chern number @xmath107 ( which is unlikely ) , this gapped state at filling @xmath22 will have a hall conductance different from @xmath108 and is not a good candidate for the fci states realized in recent numerical studies . ] since only a fraction ( @xmath109 ) of the lowest band is filled . how to construct a gapped mean - field ansatz of fci with filling fraction @xmath109 ?",
    "the answer lies in the @xmath3 gauge structure of the parton construction ( [ electron:1/m ] ) .",
    "this gauge structure allows the physical ( lattice ) symmetry to be realized projectively in the parton mean - field ansatz , which gives rise to a symmetric electron wavefunction after projection . briefly speaking",
    ", the mean - field state itself can explicitly break lattice symmetries ( such as lattice translations ) while the electron wavefunction after projection ( [ projection:1/m ] ) remains fully symmetric .",
    "by inserting _",
    "e.g.  _ @xmath74 flux in each original unit cell , one can enlarge the unit cell by @xmath12 times .",
    "therefore the corresponding mean - field state with filling @xmath22 is a state filling the lowest @xmath12 bands of mean - field ansatz ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) . if each of the @xmath12 lowest bands have a chern number @xmath110 , the mean - field state filling these @xmath12 bands would have total chern number @xmath111 , and the corresponding hall conductivity is @xmath112 because each parton carries @xmath24 electric charge @xmath56 .",
    "this gives the correct electromagnetic response of a @xmath22 spin - polarized fci state .",
    "here the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) explicitly breaks lattice translation symmetry due to the unit cell enlargement , but as long as the translated mean - field ansatz can be transformed to the original ansatz by a local @xmath3 gauge rotation , the corresponding electron wavefunction ( [ projection:1/m ] ) still respect the translation symmetry .",
    "this is because any two mean - field ansatzs differ by a local @xmath3 gauge rotation give exactly the same electron wavefunction after projection .",
    "similarly , even the mean - field hamiltonian breaks other lattice symmetries such as the point group symmetry , the electron wavefunction after projection still can be fully symmetric .",
    "the mean - field ansatz simply forms a projective representation of the symmetry group .",
    "the mathematical framework of constructing fully symmetric electron wavefunctions based on parton mean - field ansatzs is the projective symmetry group ( psg ) , which will be introduced shortly .",
    "the technique of enlarging the unit cell by @xmath12 times without physically breaking any lattice symmetry will be generalized to the case of time - reversal - invariant fti states with filling fraction @xmath113 in section [ fti ] .    following this strategy",
    ", we always require that the parton mean - field ansatz of @xmath22 fci state breaks lattice translation symmetry explicitly and enlarges the unit cell by @xmath12 times , so that the resultant mean - field state is an insulator .",
    "the partons will fill the lowest @xmath12 bands of the mean - field spectrum and the corresponding electron state after projection would still be gapped .",
    "now that the number of momentum points of each band in the ( reduced ) 1st brillouin zone equals the electron number @xmath114 , we can see the electron wavefunction ( [ projection:1/m ] ) is nothing but a slater determinant @xmath115 where @xmath116 represents the eigenvector of mean - field hamiltonian ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) . to be specific",
    ", @xmath116 corresponds to the @xmath117 parton component in momentum-@xmath118 single - particle eigenvector of the bottom - up @xmath119-th band . here",
    "@xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath114 is the total electron number at filling fraction @xmath22 .",
    "note that for a @xmath3 mean - field ansatz ( [ mfh : su(m ) ] ) in the absence of mixing terms , the lowest @xmath12 bands are all degenerate and we have @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding electron wavefunction ( [ wavefunction : zm ] ) reduces to the product of @xmath12 copies of a slater determinant : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the momentum-@xmath118 single - particle eigenvector of parton mean - field hamiltonian @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "this is a lattice version of laughlin s state in free space@xcite .",
    "however once we add lattice - symmetry - preserving parton mixing terms which breaks gauge symmetry from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , the electron wavefunction ( [ wavefunction : zm ] ) of a @xmath4 fci state , as well as its projective symmetry group which will be introduced shortly , will immediately become different from its parent @xmath3 state ( [ wavefunction : su(m ) ] ) .",
    "we emphasize again that only when the unit cell is enlarged by @xmath12 times , we will have the same number of momentum points @xmath118 as the electron number @xmath114 .",
    "the mean - field amplitudes can be determined by variational monte carlo study of the energetics of electronic wavefunctions ( [ wavefunction : zm ] ) .",
    "considering flux insertion in order to enlarge the unit cell in the mean - field ansatz ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) , another question arises : can there be more than one way of inserting fluxes into plaquettes without breaking physical lattice symmetries ? if yes , how to classify different mean - field ansatzs ( [ mfh:1/m ] ) ? the answer of the 1st question is positive and to answer the 2nd question , we need to introduce a mathematical structure : projective symmetry group ( psg)@xcite in order to characterize different  universality classes \" of symmetric fci states .",
    "psg classifies different mean - field ansatz which forms a projective representation of the physical symmetry group . in the following we give a brief introduction of psg .",

    "this operation exactly corresponds to the tunneling process @xmath295 mentioned in section [ parton ] and will cost zero energy in the thermodynamic limit",

    "apparently ( [ mfh : fti:1/m ] ) is invariant under time - reversal transformation while preserving all the lattice symmetries .    again",
    "the @xmath114-electron wavefunction ( with @xmath304 electrons for each spin here in the @xmath19-conserved case ) is obtained by projection on mean - field state @xmath305 @xmath306 which is simply a product of two slater determinants ( [ wavefunction : zm ] ) for spin up and down partons . following our discussion in section [ eft ] , the ground state degeneracy of this @xmath297 ( @xmath299 ) fti is @xmath307 on a torus and there are quasiparticle excitations ( with both spin ) with electric charge @xmath308 .    the @xmath297 ( or @xmath299 )",

    "of course it is possible that this true ground state is in the same universality class as those spin - conserved fti states , because they are gapped stable topological phases .",
    "nevertheless it is still interesting to explicitly write down a fti state without spin - conservation .",
    "there is a natural question that needs to be answered in the current formalism : when spin mixing terms @xmath309 are present in the parton mean - field hamiltonian eq.[mfh : fti:1/m ] while preserving the time - reversal symmetry , is the corresponding electronic state eq.[eq : fti_electron ] a tri fti wavefunction without spin conservation ?",

    "we therefore do not discuss this state in this paper . ] : @xmath314    in this paper , we define the fti phase as the phase of matter which is in the same universality class as the direct product of two fci states of opposite spins while preserving the time - reversal symmetry . following this definition ,",
    "the @xmath4 state defined in eq.[eq : zm ] with spin mixings is _ not _ a fti state .",
    "one clear difference between the @xmath4 state eq.[eq : zm ] and the @xmath299 fti state is their quasiparticle statistics . in a @xmath299 fti state ,",
    "the @xmath311 fluxes and the @xmath312 fluxes bind with parton charges due to the chern numbers of the parton bands , and are anyons with statistical angles @xmath315 . but in a @xmath4 state eq.[eq : zm ] , the @xmath4 fluxes do not bind with parton charges , and are bosons . this indicates that the @xmath4 state eq.[eq : zm ] , which is described by a regular @xmath4 lattice gauge dynamics with bosonic flux excitations , must separate from the @xmath299 fti state by a phase transition .",
    "another observation that we have is that , in the @xmath297 parton construction , the @xmath4 state eq.[eq : zm ] can not preserves both time - reversal symmetry and lattice translation symmetry simultaneously .",
    "essentially the technique of enlarging unit cell @xmath12 times by inserting fluxes fails to generate a translation symmetric wavefunction when partons with opposite spins are mixed . in a tri @xmath299 fti state ,",

    "after the partons with opposite spins are mixed , the gauge flux pattern of the partons no longer enjoys well - defined @xmath316 value per plaquette . as a result physical translation symmetry",
    "is broken .",
    "this simple argument dictates that , _ using @xmath297 parton construction , when partons with opposite spins are mixed , either time reversal symmetry or lattice translation symmetry must be broken to form a gapped state with filling fraction @xmath317 ( @xmath22 for each spin on average)_. in appendix [ app : psg : fti : checkerboard ] we prove this statement by a careful psg analysis .",
    "the analysis in this subsection seems to suggest that it is difficult to explicitly construct a fti wavefunctions breaking the @xmath9 conservation .",
    "in fact , this difficulty is due to the formalism of @xmath297 parton construction . in the next subsection",
