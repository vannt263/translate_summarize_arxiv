    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods have been widely employed in quantum chemistry calculations @xcite . nowadays , qmc methods have achieved accuracies comparable with ci calculations , mainly for small atoms and molecules .",
    "qmc is specially well suited to obtain the ground - state energy , providing an accurate treatment of electronic correlations in atomic and molecular systems .",
    "apart from some technical and/or algorithmic differences , all the qmc methods pursue a common objective which is to solve the schrdinger equation by relating the green s function of the system to a random walk . in the present work",
    ", we will focus on the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method , based on a short time approximation to the green s function .",
    "the required antisymmetry of the atomic and molecular ground - state wave functions leads to the well - known sign problem .",
    "the present analysis is restricted to the standard fixed - node ( fn ) approximation @xcite . according to the fn method ,",
    "a prefixed nodal surface is defined in the configuration space of the system . that model nodal surface , which does not change along the calculation , introduces a boundary condition that forbids any crossing through a node .",
    "it has been proved that the resulting fn energy is an upper bound to the exact ground - state energy @xcite , the quality of the upper bound being related to the overlap between the model and the exact nodal surfaces .",
    "the dmc method is simpler than domain green s function monte carlo @xcite but , contrary to this , dmc presents a time - step @xmath0 dependence that requires additional analysis . in general , the use of a finite @xmath0 to approximate the imaginary - time green s function introduces a bias in the calculation .",
    "that problem is addressed by using several small time steps and then extrapolating the results for the energy to the @xmath1 limit .",
    "the simplest implementation of dmc uses a short - time green s function which is accurate to order @xmath2 ( eq . [ dmc.eq8l ] ) . in this case , one obtains energies that behave linearly with sufficiently small @xmath0 and then an extrapolation to zero time - step is unavoidable . in order to reduce that large time - step dependence , and",
    "hence accelerate the rate of convergence of the calculation , several algorithms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced an accept / reject step after the gaussian and drift movements in order to exactly sample @xmath3 for all time steps if the exact wave function @xmath4 were used for importance sampling .",
    "since in a true calculation the trial wave function is close to the exact one , the time - step dependence is significantly decreased with respect to the linear case . on the other hand",
    ", the rejection method introduces the problematic issue of persistent configurations @xcite , giving rise to a somehow unpredictable behaviour of the final @xmath0 dependence of the energy .    a second alternative to reduce the time - step bias",
    "is to work out second - order algorithms by considering short - time green s function accurate to order @xmath5 ( eq . [ dmc.eq8 ] ) .",
    "some time ago , chin @xcite developed second - order propagators and proved the quadratic efficiency of them in several model problems .",
    "that approach , here referred to as quadratic dmc ( qdmc ) method , has been profusely used in the microscopic study of quantum fluids , mainly @xmath6he @xcite and @xmath7he @xcite . in all these applications ,",
    "qdmc has proved to be a real second - order algorithm and therefore the time - step bias is much more under control than in linear dmc algorithms .",
    "it is worth noticing that liquid @xmath7he is a fermion system , and the presence of a fixed nodal surface ( fn approximation ) has not broken down the expected second - order accuracy @xcite .",
    "this feature contradicts some preliminary conclusions @xcite that questioned a @xmath2 behavior when using nodal trial functions .",
    "recently , forbert and chin @xcite have improved the time - step accuracy by developing a fourth - order algorithm that has manifested a fourth - order power law in a exigent calculation like the binding energy of liquid @xmath6he .",
    "the use of importance sampling ( @xmath8 ) in the dmc solution of the schrdinger equation makes walkers to be distributed according to the mixed probability distribution @xmath9 , and not @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , mixed estimators , which are the natural output in dmc , are only unbiased when the operators in question coincide with the hamiltonian @xmath10 or commute with it . in a first and very common approximation the bias of mixed estimators of , for instance , radial operators are dealt with an extrapolation method @xcite . within this procedure , a less biased estimation is obtained from a proper linear combination of variational and mixed estimators .",
    "the efficiency of that linear extrapolation is strongly related to the variational quality of @xmath8 , and the results so obtained are still biased in a quantity difficult to assess @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , to eliminate the uncertainties present in the extrapolation method using really pure estimators .",
    "the objective of obtaining pure estimators has been accomplished by using different techniques mainly bilinear sampling @xcite , path integral formalism @xcite and forward walking @xcite . among them , several implementations of forward walking have been the most explored algorithms to achieve unbiased estimations of radial operators . following liu _",
    "@xcite , the necessary ingredient to correct the mixed estimator , i.e. , the quotient @xmath11 , can be obtained from the asymptotic offspring of the @xmath12 walker . in some implementations of that",
    "forward walking procedure , tagging algorithms @xcite have been devised in order to estimate the asymptotic number of descendants .",
    "the complexity of an efficient tagging algorithm , together with the large fluctuations observed in the asymptotic offspring , have impeded its widespread use among the dmc community .",
    "however , there is a simpler algorithm to sample pure estimators which does not require any tagging algorithmic structure and that can be very easily incorporated in any dmc code @xcite .",
    "this method has been checked in model problems and has proved its accuracy in many calculations of quantum liquids properties .    in this work ,",
    "we address the two above discussed aspects of the dmc method : the problem of the time - step dependence and the sampling of the exact distribution to extract pure estimators .",
    "we propose the use of a second - order dmc algorithm , that presents small time - step errors , and unbiased estimators to calculate exact values for non differential properties .",
    "as it is commented in the next section , the implementation of that algorithm can be done rather straightforwardly in any dmc code .",
    "the reliability of the method has been analyzed by studying the ground state of atomic lithium .",
    "this simple but not trivial system has been chosen since , on one hand , presents all the ingredients to test the performance of the method , and on the other , there are very accurate calculations @xcite with which we can compare our results .",

    "is presented in ref .",
    "it is worth noticing that a second - order algorithm , like the one presented here , does not introduce any new terms with respect to a linear approximation .",
    "therefore , it is quite simple to move from a linear code to a second - order one from the programmer s point of view .    as mentioned earlier , instead of using higher - order evolution operators",
    "some authors have been using a linear dmc method which incorporates an accept / reject step ( metropolis dmc -mdmc- ) @xcite . after a proposed gaussian plus drift movement for an individual electron ,",

    "in order to sample the pure estimator of @xmath31 , we introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath76 , associated to each walker , and that evolves with it ( its final average value will provide the pure expectation value of @xmath31 ) .",

    "a pseudo code for the pure estimation is available in ref .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the algorithm can be easily generalized to dmc programs that work with branching weights .",
    "the pure estimation depends on the size @xmath83 of the block . @xmath83",

    "@xcite , one can introduce a pure estimator for a set of increasing values of @xmath83 in a single calculation .",
    "looking at the results obtained , as a function of the block size , one observes a characteristic value @xmath85 from which on the pure estimator is the same ( considering the respective statistical errors ) .",
    "the efficiency and accuracy of both the qdmc method and the pure estimator described in the previous section are analyzed in a calculation of ground - state properties of atomic li .",
    "this is a well - known system , with nearly exact results , and serves well to our purpose since it contains the ingredients that can hinder the pursued second - order behavior : a nodal surface and cusp conditions .",
    "the present calculation works in the fixed - node approximation and therefore the energy obtained is an upper - bound to the ground - state energy of the atom .",
    "the trial wave function used for the importance sampling is the usual jastrow - slater form @xmath86 with @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) the slater determinant of spin up ( spin down ) electrons .",

    "@xcite , @xmath93 they introduce an additional exponential , with respect to hydrogenic - like orbitals , to better fit the electron - nuclear correlations .",
    "the fulfilment of the electron - nuclear cusp condition introduces two constraints that reduce the number of parameters to be variationally optimized to four : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "we have taken for them the values reported by langfelder _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the vmc energy obtained with @xmath8 is in agreement with the one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath98 .",
    "that supposes a 90% of the correlation energy , which is significantly high taking into account the relatively simple trial wave function used .",
    "that result coincides with the more sophisticated wave function @xmath99 proposed by schmidt and moskowitz @xcite , and is slightly worse than the energy obtained using @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) from the same authors . in a dmc calculation ,",
    "like the one intended here , the proposal of langfelder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is more appropriate since it satisfies both the electron - electron and electron - nuclear cusp conditions .",
    "these requirements are essential in order to eliminate divergences of the drift force that break down the expected time - step accuracy .",
    "in fact , we have verified that if @xmath99 is used instead of @xmath8 a second - order behavior is not achieved .",
    "one of the main concerns of the present work is the time - step dependence of the different dmc algorithms discussed in sec .",

    "non relativistic ground state energy is -7.478 060 323 10(31 ) , calculated variationally by using a multiple basis set in hylleraas coordinates @xcite .",
    "the last row in table i contains the extrapolation to @xmath102 based on a polynomial fit to the data .",
    "the qdmc results follow the expected second - order behavior @xmath103 with good accuracy ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the extrapolated energy @xmath105 , which reproduces the exact value , is statistically indistinguishable from the energy obtained with @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , one may move in a range @xmath107 without significant changes in the energy .",
    "this is a very useful feature which derives from the second - order green s function used in the qdmc method , and that has been also observed in quantum liquids calculations @xcite .",
    "the extrapolations corresponding to the dmc and mdmc calculations have been carried out with a second - degree polynomial that , differently from the qdmc case ( [ anal2 ] ) , includes a linear term .",
    "the variance of the dmc result is larger than the qdmc one and the energy obtained is slightly above the qdmc and exact energies . the different dependence on @xmath0 of the dmc and qdmc algorithms is illustrated in fig .",
    "1a : dmc energies are essentially linear while qdmc ones are quadratic .",
    "the introduction of an accept / reject step in the imaginary - time evolution modifies completely the time - step dependence of the dmc method .",
    "as is clear from table i and fig .",
    "1b the mdmc method allows for a significant reduction of the time - step bias , mainly for large @xmath0 . for values @xmath108 , the mdmc energies are closer to the exact result than the qdmc ones",
    "however , when @xmath0 is reduced the behavior of the energy shows a quite erratic behavior ( see fig .",
    "1c ) that makes difficult the extrapolation to zero time - step .",
    "the extrapolated value reported in table i comes from a second - order polynomial fit .",
    "the value obtained , -7.47810(14 ) is in agreement with the qdmc result but its variance is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "the pure estimator described in sec .",
    "ii , in conjunction with the qdmc method , has been used to calculate expectation values of several radial operators . in particular , we have considered the first radial moments of both the one - body density and the two - body intracule and extracule densities @xcite , defined as @xmath109 in eqs .",
    "( [ defmom ] ) , @xmath110 is the position vector of the @xmath111-electron , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the center of mass vector of electrons @xmath111 and @xmath114 .",
    "those observables play an important role in the description of the structure and dynamics of atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "they have been calculated within different theoretical frameworks @xcite to determine electronic properties , to interpret the hund rules , to elucidate electron correlation effects , or to study elastic and inelastic form factors .    in fig [ fig2 ]",
    ", we show the dependence of the pure expectation values of @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 upon the number of time steps @xmath83 of a block . in these calculations , more cpu time has been invested for the largest values of the block length @xmath83 in order to reduce the statistical noise .",
    "nevertheless , the pure estimators reach very soon the asymptotic regime , for @xmath83 values as low as @xmath118 .",
    "the statistical error of the pure estimators , evaluated in the asymptotic regime , is typically less than twice the statistical error of the mixed estimators for a fixed cpu time .",
    "the asymptotic results , i.e. , the _ real _ pure estimators , reproduce accurately the exact values . as a matter of comparison , the mixed estimations and the variational ones are also shown . with the mixed and variational estimators , one easily obtains the extrapolated values ( [ dmc.extrap ] ) that are also plotted in fig .",
    "2 . in all cases , the extrapolated estimator does not match the exact values , manifesting a bias that depends on the particular operator .",
    "the above features are also applicable to the second - degree radial operators @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 which appear reported in fig .",
    "3 .    our best pure estimates for the @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 moments",
    "are contained in tables ii , iii , and iv , respectively . within the statistical errors ,",
    "all the pure results are in agreement with the values considered as exact . with nearly the same variance than the extrapolated values , pure estimators eliminate the bias which comes from the trial wave function .",
    "on the other hand , extrapolated values retain some bias from @xmath8 which is certainly difficult to assert a priori .",
    "it is worthwhile determining the accuracy of pure estimators using different propagators like dmc or mdmc . for that purpose",
    ", we have also implemented the pure estimator algorithm to the mdmc program .",
    "the results obtained are reported in tables ii - iv .",
    "the pure mdmc results improve the extrapolated values but do not share the excellent quality obtained with the qdmc algorithm .",
    "somehow , the reason for that is the use of effective time - steps in the branching factor , the accuracy of which is a crucial point to ensure the success of the method .",
    "in the present work , the time - step dependence of the diffusion monte carlo method and the implementation of pure estimators , both in atomic systems , have been addressed .",
    "the study has been carried out for li since it already contains the necessary ingredients to test the method and , additionally , a lot of nearly exact data are available . using a short - time green s function accurate to @xmath125 , we have proved that it is possible in atomic systems to have a quadratic behavior in the simulated energy as was reported in quantum - liquid calculations . to the best of our knowledge",
    "it is the first stringent test of qdmc on atomic systems with nodal surface .",
    "the accuracy obtained had been occasionally questioned due to the presence of the divergences that appear in the drift force near the nodes .",
    "the present results show that the presence of nodes is not a real handicap , a conclusion that coincides with the one achieved in a recent qdmc calculation of homogeneous ( fermion ) liquid @xmath7he @xcite .",
    "the most crucial point to guarantee a success of the qdmc method is the correct fulfilment of the electron - electron and electron - nuclear cusps conditions .",
    "the energies obtained with the relatively simple model for @xmath8 , proposed by langfelder _",
    "@xcite , follow accurately the expected second - order behavior .",
    "additional checks performed using better trial wave functions , from the variational view , but not satisfying the electron - nuclear cusp show a more erratic behavior of the function @xmath126 .",
    "the second aim of the work has been the consideration of a rather simple pure estimator , based on the forward walking methodology .",
    "pure results for different radial moments are in agreement with exact values and are manifestly superior to the extrapolated estimations .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we think that the combination of a qdmc method and the pure estimation here presented constitutes an appropriate tool for studying atoms and small molecules .",
