    "stochastic resonance ( sr ) is a phenomenon exhibited by non - linear systems in which the system shows an enhanced response to an external periodic forcing in the presence of an optimal amount of noise @xcite .",
    "initially thought of as an explanation for the recurring ice ages on earth @xcite , presently sr finds lots of applications in diverse biological @xcite and physical systems @xcite .",
    "extensive theoritical and experimental work has been done on sr @xcite .",
    "initially considered to be a phenomenon exhibited only by bistable systems @xcite , recently there has been some studies of non - conventional sr in monostable and multistable systems @xcite . in particular sr in periodic potential systems",
    "has been of interest to researchers both in the overdamped @xcite and underdamped limit @xcite .",
    "earlier studies have established the phenomenon of sr in periodic washboard potentials @xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenon of sr in periodic potentials without any bias has been of recent interest @xcite .",
    "though there was some controversy as to whether sr occurs in an underdamped periodic potential @xcite , recent studies have conclusively proved the occurrence of sr in such systems @xcite .",
    "underdamped particle motion in periodic potentials has practical relevance in understanding diverse physical phenomenon @xcite such as electrical conductivity of superionic conductors @xcite , adatom motion on crystal surfaces @xcite , resistively coupled shunted junction ( rcsj ) model of josephson junctions @xcite etc .    in an experimental work @xcite , the sr phenomenon in an underdamped periodic potential system",
    "was studied by taking a dissipative optical lattice as the spatially periodic system .",
    "they used laser fields to create the periodic potential and produce the stochastic process of optical pumping .",
    "the friction experienced by the atoms was kept low so that they exhibited underdamped motion . using this model , schiavoni et .",
    "al . observed the phenomenon of sr on the brillouin propagation modes of the dissipative optical lattice .",
    "they also gave a theoretical account of their experimental findings .",
    "zhang et.al @xcite studied the mobility and diffusion of underdamped brownian particle in a two - dimensional periodic potential .",
    "they observed that the effect of two dimensions leads to the observance of sr in the system .",
    "the output quantities like signal amplification and diffusion rate shows a peaking behaviour with temperature which otherwise is absent in the one dimensional potential .    in an earlier work , using the average input energy per period of drive and hysteresis loop area as quantifiers of sr , it was shown that the phenomenon of sr occurs in a periodically driven underdamped periodic potential in the high - frequency regime of the external forcing @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of sr was observed with a periodic potential system which was symmetric and also when an asymmetry was introduced into the system in the form of a space dependent friction coefficient .",
    "such a spatially inhomogeneous periodic potentials system have been studied earlier to obtain particle current in the overdamped @xcite as well as in the underdamped @xcite regime . in this work",
    ", it is shown that the particles in the system can be in two distinct dynamical states of trajectories with distinct amplitude and phase relationship with the external drive . at low temperatures ,",
    "the two dynamical states are stable with fixed energies .",
    "however with the rise of temperature , transition occurs between these two states .",
    "the phenomenon of sr was attributed to the noise assisted transitions that the particles make between these two states , synchronised with the external drive . in a subsequent work @xcite ,",
    "the role of the driving amplitude on the occurrence of sr was studied .",
    "it was shown that there is a particular range of driving amplitude for which the system exhibits the phenomenon of sr .",
    "this is because the relative stability of the two dynamical states of the particle depends on the amplitude of the external drive .",
    "similar sr phenomenon was also observed in a bistable periodic potential and washboard potential @xcite .",
    "all the above works on sr @xcite were with gaussian white noise .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , the effect of colored noise on the phenomenon of sr in the underdamped motion of a particle in a periodic potential was addressed .",
    "colored noise was shown to affect the transitions between the two dynamical states and thus sr .",
    "also it was observed that , as the correlation time increases , the sr peak shifts and the sharpness of the peak decreases .    in this work we study the role of damping on sr in a periodically driven underdamped periodic potential with gaussian white noise , using the same model as in ref .",
    "we use input energy per period of external drive @xmath0 as a quantifier of sr . the input energy per period of external drive or the work done on the system per period of drive",
    "is calculated using the stochastic energetics formulation of sekimoto @xcite .",
    "this quantity has been found to be a good quantifier for sr in earlier studies for bistable systems @xcite as well as periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "we show that in a driven underdamped periodic system , the amount of damping present in the medium plays a crucial role on the occurrence of sr .",
    "in such a system the particle trajectory , @xmath1 , can exist in two definite dynamical states , with a distinct phase difference @xmath2 with the external drive @xmath0 ; the low amplitude @xmath3 state , with @xmath4 which is almost in phase with the external drive , and the higher amplitude , @xmath5 state , with @xmath6 , having higher phase difference with the external drive .",
    "the @xmath3 state has lower energy associated with it and the @xmath5 state has higher energy .",
    "the occurrence of sr is due to the noise assisted transitions that the particles make between these two states @xcite . to explain the observed dependence of sr on damping we study the stability of the two dynamical states of trajectories with respect to the different parameters like temperature , amplitude of drive and the friction coefficient .",
    "we study the input energy distributions at different temperatures across the sr peak for various values of the friction coefficient , to chararcterise sr as has been done in earlier studies @xcite . from the average response of the particle to the external drive @xmath7 ,",
    "we calculate the average phase difference @xmath8 from the @xmath9 hysteresis loops .",
    "we study the variation @xmath8 with different values of damping .",
    "the role of the average phase difference @xmath8 of the response amplitude @xmath10 and the external forcing @xmath0 on sr has been explored earlier @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the model used .",
    "section iii contains the detailed discussion of our results while in section iv we conclude our results .",
    "in this work , we consider the underdamped motion of a particle in a periodic potential @xmath11 which is symmetric in space and having a period of @xmath12 .",
    "the system is driven periodically by an external forcing @xmath0=@xmath13 .",
    "the constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the amplitudes of the potential and the driving force respectively .",
    "the dynamics of a particle of mass @xmath16 moving in a periodic potential @xmath17 in a medium with friction coefficient @xmath18 driven by an extenal periodic forcing @xmath0 , in the presence of random fluctuations is described by the langevin equation ,    @xmath19    in the above equation , the temperature @xmath20 is in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 represents the random fluctuations in the system satisfying the statistics : @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the above equation can be written in dimensionless units by setting @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . using the same symbols for the reduced variables ,",
    "the dimensionless form of the langevin equation becomes    @xmath28    in the above equation too , @xmath29 obeys the same statistics as before . for studying the particle dynamics in the deterministic regime ,",
    "@xmath20 is set equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the underdamped langevin s equation ( eq .",
    "2 ) is solved numerically using @xmath31 order heun s method @xcite , by treating it as an initial value problem .",
    "we take an integration - time step @xmath32 . in the deterministic regime @xcite and also in the low temperature , low amplitude regime @xcite , the dynamics of the particle is sensitively dependent on the initial conditions , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "so for physically relevant results , ensemble averaging is done over an ensemble of 100 particles starting with different initial positions , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , taken from a uniformly spaced grid between the two consecutive peaks of the periodic potential and initial velocity @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the input energy , or work done on the system per period of the external drive , @xmath38 , is calculated using the stochastic energetics formulation of sekimoto @xcite as @xmath39 where , @xmath40 is the period of the external drive , the potential @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 . for our calculations",
    "we consider @xmath44 and @xmath45 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is in the high frequency regime close to the natural frequency at the bottom of the potential wells .    to find the average input energy per period of external drive @xmath46 ,",
    "averaging is first done over all the periods of one trajectory as    @xmath47    the number of periods , @xmath48 , taken in a trajectory ranges between @xmath49 to @xmath50 , as required .",
    "@xmath51 is the initial number of transients which are removed .",
    "@xmath52 is then calculated by averaging @xmath53 over all the trajectories .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are presented in the following sections .",
    ". shows the main result of our work .",
    "the input energy per period or the work done per period over external drive @xmath46 is plotted versus the temperature @xmath20 for different values of the friction coefficient @xmath54 in the medium .",
    "it is observed that for lower values of @xmath54 , the @xmath46 versus @xmath20 curve shows a peaking behaviour which is a signature of sr @xcite .",
    "however as @xmath54 increases , the phenomenon of sr becomes negligible and is almost absent for @xmath55 .",
    "also the sharpness of resonance decreases with the increase in the value of @xmath54 .",
    "there is a significant change in the nature of the @xmath52 versus @xmath20 curves at lower temperatures as @xmath54 changes . for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as temperature increases , @xmath52 attains a minimum and then increases to attain a peak at an intermediate @xmath20 .",
    "however for @xmath58 and @xmath59 the minima observed at lower @xmath20 is missing .      to explain this observed behaviour",
    ", we study the particle dynamics in the deterministic regime . fig .",
    "2 shows the plot of average input energy per period in a trajectory , @xmath53 versus the initial position @xmath60 for different values of @xmath54 . for lesser damping , in the deterministic limit ( and also for lower temperatures @xcite )",
    ", the particles can exist in two distinct dynamical states of trajectories depending on the initial positions @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "these dynamical states are distinctly characterised by the phase difference @xmath2 between the particle trajectory @xmath1 and the external periodic drive @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath3 has lower amplitude and hence lesser energy and while the @xmath5 state has higher amplitude and hence higher energy .",
    "3a shows the in - phase state of trajectory with @xmath62 and the high amplitude out - of - phase trajectory with @xmath63 in the deterministic limit ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the presence of the high energy state leads to higher average input energy at @xmath64 or at low @xmath20 . as @xmath20 increases ,",
    "all the particles come down to the low energy state @xcite . thereafter , with the rise of temperature the particles make transitions between the two states .",
    "the average input energy peaks at a value of @xmath20 , where optimum transitions occur , synchronised with the external drive . for higher damping ,",
    "all the particles for a particular @xmath54 value , are in the same energy state at @xmath64 ( and also at lower @xmath20 ) , irrespective of the initial conditions ( fig .",
    "@xmath53 comparatively lower than the high energy states of the low damping regime .",
    "a look into the particle trajectories reveals that when damping is high , the particles looses sensitivity to the initial conditions and all the particles after sometime goes to the same state of motion with lesser amplitude and hence energy ( main fig .",
    "this leads to low @xmath46 at @xmath64 or low @xmath20 .",
    "though at low @xmath20 , the two dynamical states are not there for higher damping , as @xmath20 increases , the particle makes transitions between a low amplitude and high amplitude motion ( inset of fig .",
    "the peaking of @xmath52 at an optimum @xmath20 is therefore apparently due to the synchronised transitions between the two types of particle motion .    the value of temperature @xmath65 at which the average input energy @xmath66 peaks , increases as the damping increases ( fig .",
    "4 ) . significantly , the value of average input energy at the peak of the sr curve , is maximum for an optimum value of damping ( inset of fig .",
    "4 ) .    the observed shift in the sr peak to higher @xmath20 for higher @xmath54 is due to the fact that when damping is high , the optimum synchronisation of transistion between the two dynamical states of the particle occurs at higher values of @xmath20 .    at still higher values of @xmath54 ,",
    "the particle motion reaches the overdamped regime , leading to the absence of the peaking behaviour .",
    "5 shows the bifurcation diagram in the deterministic regime for different values of damping .",
    "these are obtained by recording the particle velocity @xmath67 at times @xmath68 equal to the period of the external drive and plotting them as a function of a control parameter , here @xmath15 , the amplitude of the external drive @xcite . for the value of amplitude @xmath69 , considered for fig .",
    "1 , the bifurcation diagram clearly shows the existence of two regular trajectories - one with higher velocity and the other with lesser velocity for @xmath70 .",
    "this shows that the two dynamical states accessible to the particle for lower damping can be associated with the regular trajectories in the deterministic regime .",
    "incidently , for @xmath71 , for the range of @xmath72 , two regular trajectories exists and it corresponds exactly to the range of @xmath15 in which sr behaviour is observed in ref .",
    "the presence ( or absence ) of different number of dynamical states of trajectories in the deterministic limit or for lower temperatures obviously depends on the value of friction coefficent @xmath54 and the amplitude of external drive @xmath15 under consideration .",
    "6 shows the input energy distributions for the different @xmath54 values considered in fig . 1 corresponding to different temperatures .",
    "the nature of the input energy distributions have earlier been succesfully used to understand the nature of the sr behaviour @xcite .",
    "the bimodal nature of the distributions at low temperatures for @xmath73 and @xmath57 clearly shows the existence of the high energy and low energy dynamical states .",
    "as temperature rises the input energy distributions becomes asymmetrical , with highest asymmetry at temperatures corresponding to the sr peak .",
    "for very high temperatures , the input energy distributions again becomes symmetrical about the mean value .",
    "however , for values of @xmath54 for which sr behavior is absent , @xmath74 , the input energy distributions are almost symmetrical for all values of temperature .",
    "in this section we study the variation of the phase difference @xmath8 between the external drive @xmath0 and the average particle response @xmath77 , and @xmath76 with @xmath54 .",
    "it is seen that in the deterministic limit ( fig .",
    "7a ) and also for a finite temperature ( fig .",
    "7b ) , @xmath78 and @xmath76 shows a non monotonic behaviour with the change of @xmath54 . with the increase of @xmath54 from lower value",
    ", @xmath76 shows a peaking behaviour with @xmath54 , while @xmath8 decreases showing an inflection point around the value of @xmath54 where @xmath76 peaks . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath8 was shown to have an inflection point at the peak of sr .",
    "we observe that even with the variation of @xmath54 , @xmath76 , exhibits a peaking with an associated inflection point in the phase lag .    in the deterministic case ( fig .",
    "7a ) , as @xmath54 changes , the average input energy after attaining a peak again goes to a minimum .",
    "the value of @xmath54 at the minima corresponds to the level of damping at which the two dynamical states of trajectories ceases to exist ( as discussed above in the explanation of fig .",
    "an underdamped periodic potential system exhibits sr when driven with a high frequency drive close to the natural frequency at the bottom of the potential wells .",
    "sr with average input energy per period @xmath76 as a quantifier , is found to occur only in the low damping regime .",
    "the transitions between the two definite states of the particle trajectories , characterised by their phase difference with the external drive , offers a possible explanation for the occurrence of sr @xcite .",
    "the existence of these two states are found to be dependent on the choice of the friction coefficient @xmath54 and the amplitude of drive @xmath15 . for @xmath44",
    "considered here , in the low damping regime , @xmath79 , the two dynamical states exists at @xmath64 or at lower temperatures .",
    "however for @xmath80 , though , only a single dynamical state of trajectory exists near about the deterministic limit , sr behaviour is observed .",
    "this is because , with the rise of temperature , the particle trajectories alternates between a high amplitude and low amplitude regime .",
    "synchronised transitions between these two regimes at an optimum temperature gives rise to the peak in @xmath76 .",
    "the percentage of time that the particle spends in the high amplitude and low amplitude regime and its relation to sr needs to be further explored . as with temperature",
    ", the average input energy also shows a peaking behaviour with the friction coefficient @xmath81 .",
    "the phase difference @xmath75 between @xmath0 and @xmath82 has an inflection point exactly at the @xmath54 value corresponding to the peak of @xmath76 vs @xmath54 curve .",
    "so the criteria of the presence of an inflection in @xmath75 is not exclusive only for sr peaks @xcite .",
