    "the be / x - ray binary ls  i+61@xmath1303  ( ) is the optical counterpart of the highly variable radio source , which exhibits radio outbursts every @xmath3 d assumed to be the orbital cycle ( taylor & gregory 1984 ; gregory et al .",
    "the radial velocity measurements of hutchings & crampton ( 1981 ) are consistent with this interpretation and suggest an eccentric orbit ( @xmath4 ) . the same 26.5 d period has been detected in the ubvri photometric observations of mendelson & mazeh ( 1994 ) , in the infrared ( paredes et al .",
    "1994 ) and in the soft x - ray flux ( paredes et al .",
    "the amplitude of the periodic variations is .5ex0.2 magnitudes in the optical and infrared , while the x - ray luminosity of the system often evolves within the range @xmath5 to @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ( bignami et al . 1981 ; paredes et al . 1997 ) .",
    "ls  i+61@xmath1303  is also currently regarded today as a serious counterpart candidate to the @xmath8-ray source ( gregory & taylor 1978 ; kniffen et al .",
    "1997 ; strickman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the ls  i+61@xmath1303  radio emission has been interpreted as synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles .",
    "the dependence of the radio outburst flux density on frequency , the time delay in the outburst peak , and the general shape of the radio light curves can be modeled as continuous injection of relativistic particles into an adiabatically expanding plasma cloud or plasmon ( paredes et al .",
    "it has been proposed that the genesis of such plasmons could be the result of the transition of the neutron star companion from the propeller to the ejector regime ( zamanov 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , a young radio pulsar may also be responsible for the radio emission ( maraschi & treves 1981 ; tavani 1994 ) .",
    "the ejector regime would then apply over the whole orbital period , with the flaring radio emission resulting from the variable position of the shock front between the be star wind and the relativistic wind of the pulsar .",
    "supercritical accretion models during the periastron passage ( e.g. taylor et al . 1992 ) were also widely accepted in the recent past .",
    "however , they appear now very difficult to reconcile with the confirmed sub - eddington x - ray luminosity of ls  i+61@xmath1303 .    on the other hand , a strong modulation in the amplitude of the 26.5 d periodic radio outbursts , on a time scale of @xmath2 yr ,",
    "was noticed independently by paredes ( 1987 ) and gregory et al .",
    "this modulation has been recently confirmed after a bayesian analysis of 20 yr of ls  i+61@xmath1303radio data by gregory ( 1999 ) .",
    "two possible scenarios have been considered in order to account for such a long - term variability : the precession of relativistic jets or , alternatively , the variable accretion rate due to quasi - cyclic be - star envelope variations ( gregory et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of ls  i+61@xmath1303  corresponds to a rapidly rotating b0v star with a stable equatorial disk and mass loss ( hutchings & crampton 1981 ) .",

    "in addition , our extended spectroscopic database interestingly suggests the presence of a 1600 d modulation in the h@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "these new h@xmath0 periods seem to match closely those known at radio wavelengths .",
    "the possible implications of all these findings are pointed out and discussed .",
    "our h@xmath0 spectroscopic observations of ls  i+61@xmath1303  were carried out using different astronomical facilities .",

    "our results imply that the circumstellar disk in ls  i+61@xmath1303  is among the densest disks in the be stars , i.e. , roughly a factor of 2 denser than the average .",
    "dense circumstellar disks , optically thick at infrared wavelengths , have been recently identified in other be / x - ray binaries ( , negueruela et al .",

    "these works suggest that the disks around be stars in x - ray binaries are denser and smaller that those in isolated be stars .",
    "the results of reig et al .",
    "( 1997b ) point towards neutron star preventing the formation of an extended disk in systems with short orbital periods , presumably due to tidal truncation ( okazaki 1998 ) .",
    "we have conducted a period analysis for the different h@xmath0 line parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the period search methods used were both the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) ( stellingwerf 1978 ) and the clean algorithm ( roberts et al .",
    "1987 ) . as a result",
    ", we find clear evidences that the h@xmath0 emission in ls  i+61@xmath1303  also displays variations with the same 26.5 d radio period .",
    "this behavior is better revealed in the line ratios such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath20 .",
    "the periods detected are about @xmath39  d with typical error about @xmath23 d. in fig .",
    "[ pdm26 ] we present the pdm and clean periodograms for the @xmath38 case . in this representative example , the most significant period detected in the range @xmath40  d corresponds to @xmath41 d and @xmath42 d for the pdm and clean methods , respectively .",
    "the first sub - harmonic at 53 d is also clearly noticeable in the pdm panel .",
    "the periodograms for the remaining line parameters , such as radial velocities and equivalent widths alone , may also contain some power at the 26.5 d period .",

    "the equivalent width ratio has one well defined maximum at phases @xmath44 . in the @xmath20 ratio at least one maximum is visible at phase 0.25 , which coincides with the maximums of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a second maximum is visible at phase 0.8 .",
    "it deserves noting that the appearance of this maximum is mainly due to 5 old points , which are very noisy and the presence of this maximum must be confirmed by future observations .",
    "these results proof the previous suggestions by paredes et al .",

    "( 1996 ) that an orbital variability in the line ratios exists .",
    "[ ewjd ] represents the long term evolution of the @xmath18h@xmath19 , which varies over the range 8 - 20  .",
    "these are real variations in the h@xmath0 emitted flux , because the photometric observations of mendelson & mazeh ( 1995 ) have shown that the @xmath45-band flux is stable with maximal deviation of the points from the average @xmath46 magnitudes only .",
    "two maxima in the @xmath18h@xmath19 are visible , at about jd 2448850 and jd 2450300 .",
    "the time interval between these two maxima is @xmath47 d , which is remarkably close to the 1605 day period of the radio modulation as estimated by mart ( 1993 ) and 1584 days by gregory et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we have performed the period search for long term modulation .",
    "although the values obtained are not well constrained they also point towards the four year modulation .    in fig .",
    "[ p1600 ] the h@xmath0 line parameters @xmath18h@xmath19 and @xmath48 are plotted together with the radio parameters - the phase of the radio outburst and the maximum radio flux . the radio data are taken from gregory ( 1999 ) .",
    "all data are folded on the 1584 day period .",
    "although the scatter of the points is considerable , the trend of this plot strongly suggests that the @xmath2 yr modulation in the h@xmath0 line is very likely to be real .",
    "in addition to the @xmath18h@xmath19 , we also tried to find evidence for long term periodicities ( 100 - 2000 days ) in other line parameters .",
    "the presence of @xmath20 and related variability cycles , with periods between 4 months and 3 years , is currently regarded as a common characteristic of be / x - ray binaries ( negueruela et al .",
    "similar variability cycles exist in isolated be stars , with longer periods ranging from 2 years to decades , with an average of 7 years . in those cases ,",
    "the periodic variability is interpreted as due to the propagation of global density waves in the circumstellar disk ( okazaki 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the results of this search turned out to be negative .",
    "thus , the suggestion of a @xmath2 yr h@xmath0 modulation remains present in the @xmath18h@xmath19 and the hump separation measurements .",
    "possible correlations between the @xmath18h@xmath19 and the radio outburst amplitude were investigated as well .",
    "we used for this purpose the nsf - nrao - nasa green bank interferometer data analyzed by gregory ( 1999 ) . for every h@xmath0 data point",
    ", the closest radio maximum was selected and correlations were searched for . again",
    ", none was found in reliable way .",
    "we do not rule out that all these negative results are a consequence of the considerable scatter of the points , not to say our still short time baseline for long term period studies .",
    "it deserves noting that the radio observations are missing just about the time of the @xmath18h@xmath19 maximum at jd2450300 and the h@xmath0 observations are very sparse at the maximum of the radio flux modulation ( see fig .",
    "[ ewjd ] ) .",
    "our spectroscopic results have provided a direct connection between the periodic radio outbursts of ls  i+61@xmath1303  and its be disk environment .",
    "this connection is based on the suggestive evidence that some of the h@xmath0 emission line parameters also vary with the same 26.5 d and possibly @xmath2 yr periods previously found at radio wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the outburst models based on the interaction between the compact object and the star be envelope are clearly supported .    in this context",
    ", it appears likely that the 26.5 d h@xmath0 variations have to be interpreted as the neutron star perturbing the be envelope as it was discussed by zamanov et al .",
    "however , other alternatives can not be completely ruled out .",
    "for instance , the detected 26.5 d period in @xmath20 and other ratios could also be caused by the propagation of a global density wave , as it happens in many be x - ray binaries and isolated be stars .",
    "this scenario would then imply the shortest propagation period of the global oscillation detected so far , and the first system in which the propagation of the density wave is synchronized with the orbital period of the neutron star .",
    "the h@xmath0 observations presented here can be also used to discriminate between the two previously proposed models for the @xmath2 yr modulation in the radio outburst amplitude . in the ls  i+61@xmath1303  case",
    ", it appears that the precessing jet model should be ruled out in favor of those based on quasi - cyclic be - star envelope variations .",
    "indeed , the most likely explanation of the @xmath18h@xmath19 changes , that we observe in a @xmath2 yr time scale , is a variability of the mass loss rate of the be star .    to better assess this issue ,",
    "it is instructive to obtain a estimation of how much the mass loss rate should change to account for the observed variations .",
    "we will use for this purpose the formulae of vgel ( 1993 ) for an optically thin emission line .",
    "of course , the h@xmath0 line is probably not thin , so it must be considered as a rough estimation of the mass loss rate variability .",
    "the flux of a wind line determined by recombination can be represented as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the distance to the star , @xmath51 is the electron density , @xmath52 the density of the ion considered , @xmath53 is the effective recombination coefficient of the line , and @xmath54 the emitting volume . in the circumstellar disk of ls",
    "i+61@xmath1303  the density follows the power law @xmath55 ( waters et al .",
    "1988 ) , so the ls  i+61@xmath1303  flux in h@xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath56\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the mass loss rate of the be star , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the inner and outer radius of the h@xmath0 emitting disk , and the constant @xmath60 includes the average recombination coefficient , the helium abundance and so on ( for more details e.g. vgel , 1993 ; tomov et al .",
    "we adopt that @xmath61 and for keplerian disk @xmath62 ( hanuschik 1988 ) , where @xmath26 and @xmath63 are the same as in section 3.1 .",
    "since @xmath64 , the observed h@xmath0 parameters of ls  i+61@xmath1303  correspond to @xmath65 in this way , the variability in @xmath18h@xmath19 can be explained by suggesting that the mass loss rate varies by a plausible amount of @xmath66 per cent over its average value .",
    "this mechanism will also imply variations of the density over the same range .",
    "the interaction of a neutron star with the be star wind is critical in all suggested models for the radio outbursts of ls  i+61@xmath1303 .",
    "the variability of the mass loss rate of the be star causes a variability of the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star in case of accretion onto the magnetosphere . in the model of young radio pulsar ,",
    "the variability of the be star mass loss changes the position of the shock front . in ejector - propeller model",
    "it affects the moments of switching of the ejector - at lower mass loss rate we expect the ejector to switch on earlier and the radio outburst to peak at an earlier orbital phase than at higher mass loss rate .    in fig .",
    "[ p1600 ] , it appears that the h@xmath0 measurements are not in phase nor in anti phase with the radio data .",
    "this can be due to the bad distribution of the observations as it was noted above or to a real phase shift between the h@xmath0 and radio parameters . at this moment",
    "we are only able to say that the 1600 day modulation detected in the phase variations of the 26.5 day periodic radio outbursts and the outburst peak flux density is visible in the h@xmath0 emission line too .    in any case , it is clear that additional theoretical work and spectroscopic observations will be necessary to find out what is the exact relationship between the radio outbursts and the circumstellar disk .      finally ,",
    "if the @xmath2 yr modulation in radio and h@xmath0 is due to changes in the circumstellar disk density , it can be probably detected as well in other wavelength domains .",
    "for instance , we can expect it to be visible in the infrared bands , where the circumstellar disk contributes with an excess above the stellar continuum .",
    "the x - rays and @xmath8-rays may also be modulated every @xmath2 yr too , since the high energy emission of the neutron star depends on the density of the surrounding matter with which it interacts .",
    "the main results from our h@xmath0 spectroscopic observations of ls  i+61@xmath1303are :    1 .",
    "the circumstellar disk in ls  i+61@xmath1303  is among the densest of be stars .",
    "the 26.5 day period is visible in the h@xmath0 emission line .",
