    "a compact x - ray binary consists of a stellar companion and a compact object , such as black hole or neutron star . among galactic x - ray binaries detected ,",
    "there are about twenty microquasars that present the extended relativistic radio jets .",
    "it is widely considered that during the low / hard spectral state , radio through infrared ( ir ) emissions are from synchrotron processes of relativistic electrons .",
    "however , the origin of both x - ray and @xmath0-ray emissions still remains open ; they may be from the relativistic jet , hot accretion flow , and/or disk - corona region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as far as we know , it seems to be difficult to distinguish them only by fitting emission spectra .",
    "we in this paper study the properties of polarization radiation of microquasars .",
    "the polarized radiation is an intrinsic property of the electromagnetic radiation , which carries important information on astrophysical sources , such as the geometry and orientation of the magnetic field , radiation mechanism .",
    "therefore , polarization study is one of the important methods to probe an x - ray binary , leading to a better understanding of radiative mechanism , of configuration of magnetic fields , and of matter composition as well as energetics of the jet .",
    "the polarization properties of emissions in x - ray binaries have been strongly studied at the radio waveband ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where a relatively low level of polarization is associated with synchrotron process in the jet .",
    "similar to the studies for multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , it is more interesting to study multi - wavelength polarization properties ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent work on the microquasar cygnus x1 ) . recently , @xcite observed strong polarization , 67 @xmath1 30@xmath2 , of the high - energy radiation of cygnus x1 , between 400 kev and 2 mev ( so - called mev tail ) , using the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory imager on board the integral satellite ( integral / ibis ) .",
    "this result , i.e. , the highly polarized emission at mev tail , later was independently confirmed by using the integral / spi instrument , namely , 76 @xmath1 15 @xmath2 at 0.230.85 mev ( @xcite ) . by separating the observations of cygnus x1 into hard , soft , and intermediate / transitional spectral states",
    ", @xcite confirmed that in the hard spectral state , where it is expected to be the presence of the jet , the degree of linear polarization is 75 @xmath1 32@xmath2 between 0.4 mev and 2 mev and the polarization angle is 40@xmath3.0 @xmath1 14@xmath3.3 .",
    "producing such a high polarization at mev tail was claimed as the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons in the jet due to a uniform ( ordered ) , large - scale magnetic field configuration ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that a hot accretion flow , which requires mono - direction motion of relativistic electrons along highly ordered magnetic fields in the inner regions of the accretion flow ( @xcite ) , or a hot , highly magnetized plasma corona around the black hole , where hadron and lepton interacting with matter and magnetic fields are invoked , may produce the highly polarized emission at mev tail ( @xcite ) .    in these works mentioned above",
    ", almost all investigations with regard to a high polarization degree usually are considered as the existence of a uniform , large - scale magnetic field configuration . in this context",
    ", one could intuitively understand the polarization properties by the following methods . in an optically thin region ,",
    "the electric vector of the emitted radiation is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and the linear polarization degree is given by @xmath4 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the spectral index of emitting relativistic electrons .",
    "however , the electric vector of the emitted radiation is parallel , rather than perpendicular , to the magnetic field direction in an optically thick region , where the degree of polarization is written as @xmath6 ( @xcite ) . in this paper , one of our main purposes is to suggest that a highly polarized emission does not necessarily require that the magnetic field in x - ray binary jets have a uniform , large - scale configuration , if the configuration of turbulent magnetic fields has a certain anisotropy .    as is known , magnetic turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysical objects and plays an critical role in key astrophysical processes , such as star formation , acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays , heat transport , magnetic reconnection , amplification of magnetic fields , and accretion processes ( see @xcite , for a brief review in the introduction section ) .",
    "it is necessary for the existence of turbulent magnetic fields to induce a diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "when particles cross successively the shock front , magnetic turbulence would trap these particles and results in the particle energy gain .",
    "moreover , particle - in - cell simulations demonstrate that a weibel instability , which is a crucial ingredient for amplification of magnetic fields and production of collisionless shock waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can generate turbulent magnetic fields in the shock waves , and that a conspicuous anisotropy of the magnetic turbulence appears at the saturation stage of field amplification ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider that random , turbulent magnetic fields appear in the jet of black hole x - ray binaries ( see @xcite for theoretical basics ) . these magnetic fields mixed by large- and small - scale random structures",
    "are confined to a certain plane ( slab ) , i.e. , the limiting case of a three - dimensional geometry of the total compression , which results in the polarized synchrotron and jitter emissions . with this magnetic field configuration",
    ", we explore whether relativistic electrons in random fields can produce an expected highly polarized emission in the jets of x - ray binaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "model descriptions including relativistic electron evolution , model geometry and radiative mechanisms of polarization are presented in section  2 .",
    "numerical results of the model are shown in section  3 .",
    "section  4 is an application of the model to cygnus x1 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in section  5 .",
    "we employ a classical geometry of the microquasar in which dipole jets are launched from the inner regions of an accretion disk , perpendicular to the orbital plane of binary system .",
    "thanks to collision interactions between the ejected matter , shock waves are generated in the bulk motion of the jets .",
    "theoretical works suggested that the ordered , large - scale magnetic fields anchored in an accretion disk or a rotating black hole induce the generation of jets by means of a magneto - centrifugal mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural that when modelling the multi - broadband observations of x - ray binaries , the ordered , large - scale magnetic field configuration is usually assumed in operation in many published works . due to the generation of the shock waves and compression between them , it is easy to envision that the large - scale magnetic fields could be disturbed or disrupted to bring about random , small- and large - scale fields , which are mixed by some random , small - scale turbulent magnetic fields generated behind shock fronts by the turbulence .",
    "the anisotropy of these turbulent fields can be generated by compression of shock waves within the jet or shear at the jet boundary layer of initially chaotic magnetic fields as well as by production of anisotropic turbulence by the shock wave itself . in this work ,",
    "anisotropic structures are confined to a limiting case of the total compression , i.e. , a slab geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which directions of magnetic fields are parallel to the slab plane .    in these highly turbulent environments , when the characteristic scale of turbulence @xmath7 , which is of the order of the plasma skin - depth , is greater than the non - relativistic larmor radius @xmath8 , radiation proceeds in the usual synchrotron regime . here , @xmath9 is the strength of the magnetic field as a function of the height of the jet , and other parameters have a conventional meaning . on the contrary , @xmath10 ,",
    "the emission is referred to as diffusive synchrotron radiation ( @xcite ) , or jitter radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "below , we first study the evolution of relativistic electrons in jets , which has an isotropic distribution along the jets .",
    "subsequently , the configurations of the magnetic slab and the jet and radiative mechanisms of polarization are presented .",

    "we neglect synchrotron self - compton scattering and comptonization of the photons from accretion disk and corona components , on the basis of the studies of @xcite .",

    "the normalization constant of relativistic electrons , @xmath29 , is determined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the power of injection electrons , and @xmath32 is the accretion power of the system via stellar wind outflows of the companion star . here , @xmath33 is the mass accretion rate for a high - mass system .",
    "the power of relativistic electrons , @xmath34 , is a fraction of the jet power of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is set as 0.1 and @xmath37 is an adjustable parameter . @xmath38 and @xmath39(@xmath40 )",
    "are minimum and maximum energies of the relativistic electrons , respectively .      in order to determine the positions of both the slab and the jet on the sky plane , and formulate the subsequent polarization radiative processes , we in figure [ fig : diagram ] provide a schematic illustration for the model geometry .",
    "the definition of the position angles of both the jet and slab is associated with the angles on the sky plane relative to the north celestial pole , and these angles are counted to the east , i.e. , counter - clockwise . as shown , the direction of the line of sight is denoted as the unit vector * _",

    "as shown in each panel of figure [ figs : fittingtail ] , synchrotron emission presents an exponent - like cutoff appearing at lower frequencies than that of figure [ fig : angles ] ; this is because that in our fitting the low break energy @xmath187 is required .",
    "the synchrotron process provides a higher polarization degree than the polarized jitter radiation , but due to low synchrotron emission fluxes it is not promising to detect such a synchrotron polarization signal . as expected , the jitter radiation at mev tail can provide a high polarization degree .",

    ", it needs to consider self - absorption processes of low frequency radio emissions in this case , which would decrease the degree of polarization predicted in this paper , but this is beyond the scope of the paper .",

    "the fitting results of multiband observations of cygnus x1 and the corresponding polarization degree are plotted in figure [ figs : fittinggevjitter ] , in which the fitting parameters used in each panel are listed table [ table : cases ] . as shown in this figure ,",

    "we study here the case of dominant large - scale fields ( @xmath216 ) .",

    "the fitting results show that the radio fluxes are from the synchrotron emission , and _ fermi _ lat fluxes to low frequency bands ( @xmath175 hz ) are a combination of jitter and synchrotron emissions .",
    "_ fermi _ lat fluxes to high frequency bands ( @xmath225 hz ) are due to non - polarized ic processes of the surrounding companion .",
    "we do not include these figures in the paper for a conciseness , but they , generally speaking , are similar to that of figure [ figs : fittinggevjitter ] .",
    "the integrated polarization degrees we obtain are @xmath226 at radio band due to synchrotron polarization , @xmath195 at _",
    "fermi _ energy region from both jitter and synchrotron polarizations , for the case of the angle @xmath182 .",
    "in the same way , we have the degrees of polarization : @xmath210 at radio and @xmath227 at _ fermi _ energies ( @xmath228 hz ) for @xmath157 ; @xmath229 at radio and @xmath226 at _ fermi _ energies for @xmath191 ; as well as @xmath214 at radio and @xmath215 at _ fermi _ energies for @xmath193 .",
    "the fitting procedures used above are similar to those presented in @xcite , in which we have studied the origin of multiband emission in a certain region of the jet . here",
    ", we simply express the motivations for the parameter choice .",
    "based on the studies in @xcite , in which the mev tail emissions are produced inside the binary system and the gev band emissions are from the distance close to the binary system scales , we thus fix @xmath230 ( see figure [ figs : fittingtail ] ) and @xmath231 ( see figure [ figs : fittinggevjitter ] ) for fitting mev tail plus _ fermi _ lat data and for only _ fermi _ lat data , respectively .",
    "then , we adjust magnetic field strength @xmath92 and @xmath232 to calculate radiative fluxes due to jitter , synchrotron and ic scattering processes . noticing competition between jitter , synchrotron and ic radiation losses , we further change @xmath107 , which is directly associated with competition between jitter and synchrotron emissions , and indirectly influences on the ic spectra ( @xmath107 in figure [ figs : fittingtail ]",
    "is adjusted to 12 due to this reason ) .",
    "besides , it should be noticed that the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath38 would impact on emission fluxes in the radio frequency band .    from the above fittings",
    ", we find that sed fittings exist relatively large degeneracy .",
    "for instance , as for the change of the angle @xmath49 , the model can provide a good fitting , but the degree of polarization distinct from seds is very sensitive to the angle values .",
    "it is necessary for the presence of the dominant small - scale turbulent magnetic fields to explain the highly polarized hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray emissions , i.e. , mev tail polarized radiation .",
    "thus , it can be seen that the study of polarization radiation is a robust method to uncover the origin of multiband emissions , the structure of magnetic fields , and the properties of turbulence .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the properties of polarized radiation from x - ray binaries , by assuming the existence of the turbulent magnetic field environment in the jet .",
    "these turbulent fields are composed of large- and small - scale magnetic field structures , which result in a polarized jitter radiation when the correlation length of turbulence is less than the non - relativistic larmor radius , i.e. , @xmath10 , or a polarized synchrotron emission when @xmath233 .",
    "we calculate numerically the seds and the degree of polarization for a general microquasar .",
    "the results show that turbulent magnetic field configurations can indeed provide a high polarization degree .",
    "then , the model is applied to study the properties of polarized radiation of cygnus x1 . under the constraint of the fitting of multiband observations ,",
    "our studies demonstrate that the model can explain the high polarization degree at mev tail and predict the highly polarized properties at high - energy @xmath0-ray bands ( @xmath175 hz ) .",
    "the fittings of cygnus x1 showed that the dominant small - scale turbulent magnetic field plays a key role for explaining the high degree of polarization at mev tail .",
    "moreover , the modelling needs a large index of the turbulence , @xmath145 , corresponding to the turbulence in a shock environment ( @xcite ) , which is in agreement with a usual expectation that relativistic electrons are accelerated by the shocks in the jet .",
    "however , in order to explain the mev tail spectral observation and its high polarization degree , it needs to provide a hard spectral index , @xmath234 , of the injected relativistic electrons .",
    "the acceleration mechanism of particles is an unsolved problem and subjected to the ongoing debate .",
    "generally , it could be shock acceleration , stochastic acceleration or magnetic reconnection ( see * ? ? ? * for a brief review ) , or shock interaction in a magnetic reconnection site @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic diffusive shock acceleration , that is , a first - order _ fermi _ process , is often considered as the most effective acceleration mechanism , which gives the spectral index close to 2 , from a theoretical point of view . in the particle - in - cell simulations",
    ", solid evidence shows that the late - time particle spectrum integrated over the whole reconnection region is a hard power law ( @xmath235 ) for high magnetization environments ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a high magnetization , the formation of a hard power - law close to 1 of the energetic particle spectrum is obtained by three - dimensional pic simulations from a relativistic magnetic reconnection ( @xcite ) .",
    "besides , the analytical studies of shock acceleration in a magnetic reconnection site also gives a hard spectral index 1 ( @xcite ) .    in the case of the dominant large - scale turbulent magnetic field ( including an equipartition case ) , it is hard to explain the mev tail emission by jitter and/or synchrotron radiation . in other words ,",
    "the small - scale turbulent magnetic field and resultant jitter radiation play an important role for explaining the highly polarized hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-rays observed by integral . as far as we know , the jitter radiation has usually been discussed in the context of the magnetic field amplification in grbs ( @xcite , see also @xcite for a recent work ) and the generation of microturbulence ( e.g. , via weibel instability ) in weakly magnetized shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "the production of jitter radiation in the so - called small - scale turbulent magnetic field requires the condition that the coherence length of the field be much smaller than the nonrelativistic larmor radius , @xmath10 . in the case of microquasar jet environment ,",
    "the averaged magnetic field in the emitting region is in the range of about @xmath236 to @xmath237 along the outflow direction , which implies the turbulence scale to be in the range of @xmath238 to @xmath239 via the condition , @xmath240 .",
    "the presence of the large - scale turbulent magnetic fields would produce the synchrotron emission losses , whose degree of the polarization is slightly higher than the polarization degree of the jitter radiation for spectral indices of electron population used in this study .",
    "however , the degree of the polarization of the total synchrotron emission is equal to that of the total jitter radiation ( see equations ( [ totaliisyn ] ) and ( [ totaliijit ] ) ) .",
    "for the same mean magnetic field , an electron energy loss due to synchrotron or jitter emission is the same in the large- and small - scale turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "however , in the realistic microquasar jet environment , the ratio of the jitter radiation intensity to synchrotron emission one ( due to electron population ) can be expressed as @xmath241 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath242 is the power - law spectral index of emitting electrons .",
    "therefore , the presence of the large - scale magnetic fields would increase the total radiation fluxes and the corresponding polarization degree .",
    "similar to a lot of literature published ( @xcite ) , which presented an emission possibility originating from accretion disk or corona region , we give up fitting the mev tail data using the jet model . in the fittings",
    ", we return to more commonly used parameters , such as @xmath222 and @xmath131 .",
    "the results show that the model also predicts a high polarization degree at high - energy @xmath0-ray region ( @xmath175 hz ) .    concerning turbulent magnetic fields , we consider that the variations of the turbulent magnetic field strength are distributed as a function of the height @xmath16 along the jet .",
    "in addition to the spatial correlation of magnetic field , they are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in the plane compressed by shocks , for the sake of simplicity . in the simulation of synthetical data cube of mhd turbulence , it is usually regarded as a gauss type distribution with narrow dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in some case , a power - law form with wide dispersion is also used ( e.g. , @xcite ) . besides , in the environment mixing large- and small - scale turbulent magnetic fields ,",
    "their relative strengths are still needed to further study theoretically .",
    "our study has assumed that the compressed slab of turbulent magnetic fields is in the same direction along the whole dissipation region of the jet . to a large extent ,",
    "the ` slab ' , which is produced by compression of shock waves and shearing at the jet boundary layer of initially chaotic magnetic fields , should be symmetrically oriented around jet axis .",
    "the simplest geometry is that the normal to the slab * _ s _ * is parallel or perpendicular to the jet axis * _ j_*. the former corresponds to @xmath243 , that is , the plane direction of the slab is perpendicular to * _ j _ * , whereas the latter to @xmath244 .",
    "more complicated ( also realistic ) configuration is that the configuration of slabs with the normal vector * _ s _ * is at some fixed angle to * _ j _ * , so that directions of * _ s _ * would create a cone around * _ j _ * , i.e. , conical geometry of turbulent magnetic fields compressed .",
    "the study of these complicated configurations is beyond the scope of the paper , but it is expected that they would result in more significant polarization degree , which in local region may be changing away the jet axis and reach maximum possible value at the edges of the jet , due to more anisotropic turbulent structures . in this case , the resulting directions of linearly polarized radiation on the sky would also change along with the angle between * _ j _ * and * _",
    "s_*.    the results of the model application to cygnus x1 show that the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the slab of magnetic fields is @xmath245 , which implies that the angle between the direction of the jet axis and the normal direction to the slab plane is @xmath246 , using observational polarization angle at mev tail @xmath247 ( @xcite ) and the position angle of the jet @xmath248 ( @xcite ) . otherwise ,",
    "if the position of the normal of the slab @xmath52 is determined a priori , one can reproduce observational polarization angle .",
    "in addition to the presence of the highly polarized @xmath0-ray emission , cygnus  x emits also low polarization radiation in radio , ir , optical , uv and x - ray wavebands .",
    "the purpose of the current work is focused on the highly polarized @xmath0-ray emission under the constraint of radio and ir observations .",
    "this work predicts a high polarization degree , @xmath198 , in radio , ir and optical bands .",
    "it should be noticed that our studies only take into account an intrinsic polarization emission from the microquasar jets . in the realistic scenario , several depolarization processes , such as internal ( external ) faraday dispersion , gradients in rotation measurement across the telescope beam , a reduced polarization due to unpolarized radiation components , and the self - absorption effect at low - frequency bands , could be at work to reduce the intrinsic polarization degrees predicted in the work .",
    "hence , although the model has predicted the degree of polarization of about @xmath249 at high - energy @xmath0-ray region ( see figures [ figs : fittingtail ] and [ figs : fittinggevjitter ] ) , it is unlikely to detect a polarization signal in the @xmath225 hz ranges . from this point of view",
    ", @xmath250 should be a lower limit required for explaining mev tail observations .",
    "the lowly polarized uv and x - ray observations are usually explained by interstellar dust emission component and thermal plasma corona radiation surrounding the central black hole , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; this work does not explore these points .",
    "our work argues that a high polarization degree does not necessarily require the field to be uniform in the jet of x - ray binaries , and claims that it is important for the presence of small - scale turbulent magnetic fields . in the next years",
    ", _ fermi _ lat has the potential to detect high degrees of polarization from some of the bright @xmath0-ray binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization observation at high energy @xmath0-ray region ( @xmath175 hz ) , which can break degeneracies between radiative mechanism in theoretical models , is an excellent way to test our theory model .",
    "even so , many important points , such as turbulence spectral slope , magnetic field structure , distributions of relativistic electrons , and electron acceleration mechanism , have an urgent need for in - depth study .",
