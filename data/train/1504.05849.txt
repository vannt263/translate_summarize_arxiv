    "the jordan - wigner transformation maps a pauli spin 1/2 system onto a ` hard - core ' boson model @xcite .",
    "this leads to a bosonic description of the collective excitons whilst maintaining pauli s exclusion principle , which forbids double excitation of a single site . in our case",
    "each ` spin ' represents one of @xmath0 identical optical emitters / absorbers and the spin s ` up ' / ` down ' projection along the @xmath86-axis denotes the presence / absence of an exciton on the respective site .",
    "we assume a ring - like geometrical arrangement as shown in fig .",
    "1a of the main paper .",
    "considering a ring rather than a spin chain with free ends introduces the additional complexity of an alternating periodic or anti - periodic boundary condition depending on the number of excitations  @xcite .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation is achieved by introducing bosonic creation and annihilation operators , which are defined in terms of the pauli spin raising and lowering operators as follows : @xmath87 here , the @xmath88 factors are traditionally referred to as ` strings ' , and their inclusion is necessary for producing the correct anti - commutation relation for fermions , which also apply to hard - core bosons : @xmath89 performing the transform ( [ eq : jw1 ] , [ eq : jw2 ] ) to the hamiltonian of the main paper given by eq .",

    "the final term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) has been introduced to implement the required alternating boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "note that this elegant and compact form of the hamiltonian double - counts the interaction term for @xmath92 , but this is of no concern here since we are only interested in @xmath93 .",
    "clearly , the operator @xmath94 commutes with the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) , so that the eigenvalues of @xmath94 are good quantum numbers .",
    "the system can thus be partitioned into two parity subspaces of even and odd exciton number @xmath95 , each of which can be solved separately .",
    "we complete the diagonalisation with the help of the fourier transform    @xmath96    where the @xmath97 are phase factors defined by @xmath98    @xmath99{\\includegraphics[width=2in]{figs / excitoncounts.pdf } } &    \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[width=2in]{figs / excitoncountsfd.pdf } } &    \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[width=2in]{figs / excitoncountsnp.pdf } }    \\end{array}$ ]    each of the above @xmath0 distinct @xmath100-values corresponds to a single exciton state of the system .",
    "the eigenstates of the full multi - exciton system are given by combinations of these states .",
    "the eigenstates are thus defined by sets @xmath11 whose elements are the @xmath100 s , and where the number of elements in @xmath11 represents the number of excitons in the state ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle manifests itself by allowing only different single exciton states to form a multiple exciton state .",
    "the eigenvalues are then given by @xcite @xmath102 with corresponding eigenstates @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the ground state .",
    "obviously , eq .  ( [ eq : gen ] ) yields an eigenstate with @xmath95 excitations and each band comprises a total of @xmath105 possible states .",

    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) is then simply given by @xmath106",
    "the optical transition operator @xmath107 connects eigenstates differing by one exciton .",
    "the transition rates are proportional to @xmath108 and can be explicitly evaluated with the help of slater determinants , albeit involving some tedious calculations @xcite , yielding :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is 1 if @xmath111 for integer @xmath112 and zero otherwise .",

    "in fig .  2 of the main text we display the steady - state exciton population in the ratchets model as a function of phonon and photon temperatures , and also the relative population of the ratchets model over the forced dark ( fd ) scenario .",
    "to complete the picture , in fig .",
    "[ fig : steadyex ] we show the absolute values of the steady - state exciton count for all three scenarios . in the no phonons ( np ) case ,",
    "as expected there is no dependence on the phonon temperature . indeed , since there is no dark - state protection in the np case , we find a lower exciton population than in the other two cases ; the difference is more pronounced at lower phonon bath temperature , when dark states are most likely to be populated . naively , one might expect the surface for the fd scenario to plateau at one , however , the ladder of bright states remains available in this case and via it population can access and get trapped in higher lying dark states above the single exciton band .",
    "we expect this to happen for high optical and low but finite phonon temperature , and indeed in this region the surface rises above one .",
    "note that unlike panels ( a ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : steadyex ] , ( b ) starts at a phonon bath temperature of @xmath115  k due to numerical instabilities in our steady - state solver . at much lower phonon temperature , where phonon - assisted relaxation becomes effectively uni - directional , we expect the fd surface to drop towards one , as it gets increasingly unlikely for population to bypass or escape the single excitation subspace . using alternative methods ,",

    "our photocell cycle relies on the extraction of the excitons from the ring to the trap site .",
    "below we give an explicit description of two different mechanisms and models , one of which features in the main text , the other whose results are displayed for comparison in this supplement .    for the incoherent hopping process that we use in the main text",
    "we assume that excitons are extracted incoherently from a single site of the ring to the trap .",
    "we then simply include a dissipator : @xmath116   = \\gamma_{x } { \\cal d}[\\sigma^{-}_1 \\sigma^{+}_{t } , \\rho ] \\,.\\ ] ] for optimal extraction the trap s energy is resonant with the desired extraction level , i.e.  for the ratcheting and fd cases , the lowest state in the first exciton band , @xmath59 ; for the np case , the trap is instead made resonant with the bright state , @xmath117 . for consistency and a fair comparison across the different mechanisms ,",
    "the energy of the trap site is also adjusted in the same way for the extraction mechanism described next .",
    "we use the single site extraction process in the paper since it is relatively straightforward to implement .",
    "however , it is not necessarily the most efficient  so in this supplement we will also consider the possibility of extraction directly from particular eigenstates of the ring .",
    "this can sometimes be achieved by suitable positioning of the trap : e.g.  placing the trap at the ring s centre with equal coupling to all other sites allows extraction from symmetric states  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this does not straightforwardly generalise to the more complex anti - symmetric dark states .",
    "for the special cases of @xmath118 alternating phases on the interaction terms achieves the desired coupling @xcite ; however , scaling up to more sites would require increasingly exotic molecular orbitals .",
    "we therefore implement a collective state extraction method using a set of operationally motivated lindblad operators @xmath119 . in the case of the ratchets and the fd model , the @xmath119 move population from the lowest state of a particular band of @xmath120 into the lowest state in the exciton band below , exciting the trap in the process . in the np case , the @xmath119",
    "go from the highest state of one band to the highest of the band below ( since these are the only states accessed in this model ) .",
    "we incorporate this process into our model through the dissipator @xmath121 =   \\gamma_{x } \\sum_{i } { \\cal d}[\\hat{c}_{i } , \\rho ] \\,,\\ ] ] where , once again , @xmath122 is the effective extraction rate .",

    "each plot is found by varying @xmath68 independently for the different models .",

    "[ fig : collabs ] shows the absolute power for the ratchets and np model for the collective trapping model .",
    "this plot is equivalent to fig .  3 of the main paper which displayed the same quantities for the single site incoherent trapping model .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : collrel ] shows the _ relative _ power enhancement of ratcheting over both artificial models for the collective trapping model  again this is the equivalent plot to fig .  4 in the main paper but here for the collective extraction model .",
    "unsurprisingly , the absolute power extracted in the collective model is larger than the incoherent model .",
    "this is because we are here extracting directly from the ratchet or dark states and thus have access to the ` entire ' exciton rather than just its projection onto a single site of the ring .",
    "the relative advantage of ratcheting over fd has a similar form for both extraction mechanisms , though it is smaller for the collective model .",
    "in figs .  3 and 4 of the main paper we are displaying maximum output power as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath76 . each point in those plots",
    "is a result of generating a power - voltage curve for each choice of parameter , and finding the maximum power .",
    "each such curve is generated by varying the trap decay rate @xmath62 .",
    "we show examples of these power - voltage curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3old ] , considering the usual three scenarios : ratchets , fd and np . on the upper @xmath124-axis",
    "we also show the values of @xmath62 corresponding to each voltage taking the example of the ratchets case ; as shown @xmath62 varies over orders of magnitude for only modest voltage shifts .",
    "these curves make use of the parameters specified in table i of the main text , and a comparison with figs .",
    "3 and 4 of the main paper shows that @xmath125  ev and @xmath126 ev are in fact not optimal for showing the full ratcheting advantage .",
    "further examples of @xmath127 curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottleneck ] , each for different single site incoherent extraction rates , fixing @xmath125  ev .",
    "we can see here the advantage of ratcheting in the intermediate and severe bottleneck regions .",
    "for very fast extraction , any absorbed photon gets immediately transferred to the trap , so that neither dark - state protection nor ratcheting offer any advantage ( the system is already operating as efficiently as possible ) . in this case",
    "np achieves the same current as ratchets and fd , but ends up producing a higher resultant power as its trap transition frequency  and thus effective voltage  is higher , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : ext ] .",

    "to model disorder , we generate random site energies that are normally distributed around the transition frequency @xmath130  ev with standard deviation @xmath131 . the @xmath132 value pairs for each trap decay frequency @xmath62",
    "are averaged over 100 different implementations , and are based on the bloch - redfield dissipator  @xcite for the optical and phonon interactions .",
    "results for different degrees of disorder are shown in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder ] . for small levels of disorder @xmath133",
    ", there is little deviation from the ideal case , and 100 implementations are indeed enough to give fairly smooth curves .",
    "once @xmath131 approaches @xmath4 ( 0.02  ev corresponds to a @xmath131 of around 1.14% ) , however , not only is the achievable power with ratchets visibly reduced but our statistical ensemble is also not large enough to smooth out those larger performance variations , resulting in jagged - looking curves .",
    "interestingly , the performance of the np case improves with increasing disorder .",
    "this may be due to the fact that even in asymmetric circumstances eigenstates with a varied range of interesting optical properties may arise  @xcite in the fully accessible hilbert space , and the absorption dynamics is no longer restricted to only the single lowest ladder transition .",
    "we do not show the fd scenario here , as the presence of disorder makes it impossible to properly distinguish between allowed ` ladder ' and fd ` forbidden ' optical transitions .",
    "however , we note that random sampling for small levels of disorder ( well below relative site energy fluctuations on the order of a percent )  where the symmetries and properties of system eigenstates remain largely unperturbed  indicates that fd always performs worse than the full ratchets model , as expected .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder ] shows the averaging from a single up to 1000 implementations of randomness for @xmath134 .",
    "interestingly , the single run has some datapoints which can even exceed the ideal , fully ordered , ratcheting performance  though the ensemble average power is clearly below that in the fully ordered case .",
    "we suspect these outliers correspond to highly efficient asymmetric configurations : for the case of a dimer and dark - state protection it has recently been established that certain asymmetric arrangements can potentially outperform symmetric ones  @xcite . however , the unravelling of the precise interplay of mechanisms at play will be more complicated in this larger system , but would be an interesting line of investigation for a future study .",
    "note that we keep our extraction and trap model unaltered for our disorder calculations , i.e.  we extract with a trap energy of @xmath135 for the np and ratchets case , respectively .",
    "this simplifying choice may in general entail slightly over- or underestimating the effective voltage of our trap .",
    "however , the relative voltage discrepancy arising from this assumption is expected to be limited by energy shifts due to disorder given by @xmath131 . as seen in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : disorder ] , disorder in the model affects the power output for both ratchets and np much more significantly than that , meaning our results are clearly dominated by other processes as opposed to just being an artefact of our simplified trapping model .",
    "we model non - radiative decay by including a full set of uni - directional lindblad lowering processes acting in the site basis ( as opposed to the collective optical decay events which are present due to the interaction with the shared electromagnetic environment ) .",
    "increasing non - radiative decay rates significantly decreases the achievable current and power output of the photocell as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rad ] .",
    "interestingly , non - radiative decay does not affect all three scenarios equally , and the ratcheting advantage diminishes with larger non - radiative recombination rate .",
    "the ratchets states enjoy no special protection against non - radiative decay acting on individual sites , and when they carry more than one excitation the impact of non - radiative decay is felt more acutely",
    ". however , the combined ratcheting and dark state protection advantage persists as long as non - radiative decay does not become the dominant loss channel .",
    "we now discuss the impact of exciton - exciton annihilation ( eea ) on the ratcheting efficiency enhancement .",
    "eea is the result of a two step dynamical process  @xcite .",
    "first , excitons in adjacent sites on the ring can fuse together , creating an excitation on a single chromophore that has twice the energy of the first excited exciton state so far considered .",
    "the mechanism for this is , like exciton transfer , frster coupling ",
    "i.e. a dynamic dipole - dipole interaction between the adjacent excitations .",
    "the second step is fast non - radiative decay of the double energy state on the excited chromophore back down to the regular single exciton state .",
    "the hamiltonian underlying the first step might be expressed by using an extension of the notation we have employed in the main paper .",
    "we now allow three levels per chromophore : the already - considered ground state @xmath136 and low energy exciton state @xmath137 , as well as the newly introduced double energy excitation @xmath138 .",
    "with these state labels the pauli operator we use in the main text is @xmath139 , and now we define a new spin raising operator @xmath140 .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes : @xmath141 where we have made the simplifying assumption that the two excitation energy transfer has the same strength ( @xmath4 ) as the single excitation one .",
    "this is reasonable , implying a similar transition dipole from @xmath136 to @xmath137 as from @xmath137 to @xmath138 . by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham2 ] ) for an @xmath16 system , in a basis of states @xmath142 on each site , we are able to straightforwardly obtain the new eigenstates of the system . again , since the hamiltonian preserves total excitation number ( assuming that @xmath138 states count as two excitations ) , then the eigenstates fall into a series of bands , each corresponding to a different excitation number .",
    "the zero excitation ground state and the four single excitation eigenstates are obviously unaffected by the @xmath138 states , but the second band now consists of ten , not six , possible states , which are now combinations of both @xmath138 states on single sites and @xmath137 states on two sites .",
    "the lowest energy state in this second band ( let us label it @xmath143 ) would be reached following rapid relaxation following ratchet action from the first band .",
    "we have calculated that @xmath143 contains only a 16% @xmath138 state character ( by probability ) .",
    "considering that population of the @xmath138 state is crucial for eea to occur , we can conclude that eea will be significantly suppressed from @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , we have calculated the electric transition dipole moment between @xmath143 and all states in the first band .",
    "the dipole is zero for transitions into all but one of the first band states , and only 18% of the dipole of a single uncoupled chromophore for the remaining state .",
    "by contrast , if the @xmath138 states are not included , the equivalent transition dipole is 41% of the single chromophore value .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the lowest state of the second band is more protected from optical re - emission if the @xmath138 states are included in the model .",
    "this means that including the possibility of doubly - excited sites surprisingly lends a certain degree of extra ` dark - state protection ' character to the second excitation band , allowing more time for exciton harvesting , and thus improving the efficiency of the device .",
    "there are materials that do not quickly decay through non - radiative transition to the lowest energy state of a given band - these materials then do not obey _",
    "kasha s rule",
    "_  @xcite , which states that optical emission is always from the lowest energy state of a band . for these materials ,",
    "the reasoning above regarding the composition of the lowest second band state is less relevant .",
    "however , in that case , the second step involved in eea - the non - radiative decay of the @xmath138 state - is also inhibited , and this too leads to an inhibition of eea and so to more efficient energy harvesting devices . indeed",
    ", finding materials that violate kasha s rule for novel optoelectronic applications such as this is a very active area of research  @xcite .    as discussed above ,",
    "we expect the @xmath143 to have suppressed eea , but we do not expect it to disappear completely .",
    "we therefore look at its impact by introducing eea it into our model by means of one - way lindblad operators taking population from all doubly or higher excited states to the highest energy ( ladder ) state in the single excitation subspace . in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation ] we show power - voltage characteristics with such eea taken into account .",
    "each plot compares the ratchets , fd and np models , for the value of the annihilation rate indicated above it .",
    "as expected , neither the np case nor the fd scenario are visibly affected . as annihilation increases",
    ", the maximal current achieved by the ratchets case eventually reduces to that of fd  but , importantly , the ratcheting advantage only fully vanishes once the exciton - exciton annihilation rate exceeds the spontaneous emission rate by an order of magnitude or more . on close numerical inspection ,",
    "fd and np also suffer very slightly under eea , because in both those cases the ladder of bright states remains available and there is thus slight chance of multiple excitation .",
    "however , unlike in the case of non - radiative recombination , annihilation never kills the dark - state protection advantage .",
    "in this section we mention some possible systems in which the action of ratchet states might be initially detected .    ideally , we require a system composed of at least four coupled , radiation - absorbing elements , and where the spacing between each element is either much less than the wavelength of light , or else where the elements can be placed such that the radiation with which they interact is in phase with all of them .",
    "this latter condition allows for the possibility of using systems placed an integer number of wavelengths apart , and would include , for example , superconducting qubits interacting with microwave cavity fields .",
    "for example , two such qubits have been used to demonstrate super - radiance  @xcite . including two more would enable ratchets states to be reached , initially by driving the bright excitation and then by altering single qubit phases through local manipulation .",
    "a system closer in spirit to what we have described here would involve coupled optical absorbers . for example",
    ", nv@xmath144 centers in diamond are established as systems on which to test quantum information protocols  @xcite and fundamental features of quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "nvs can be individually addressed optically , and have spin selective coupling to light that allows optical measurement of their spin state .",
    "moreover , they have been produced in patterns with a precision of around @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the wavelength at which they emit  @xcite .",
    "the prospect of collective photon emission ( superrradiance ) with multiple nv centres has recently been studied  @xcite .",
    "nvs have strain dependent splitting so would have some disorder , though as we have seen in section  [ sec : disorder ] above , this does not mean that ratchets states lose all function .",
    "however , it may be that silicon vacancies ( sivs ) in diamond  @xcite , or alternatively ( di)vacancies in sic , make better test systems .",
    "for example , sivs in diamond can be placed with @xmath147 precision and are very stable , with inhomogeneous broadening heavily suppressed by their inversion symmetry .",
    "for all these kinds of emitter , the frster coupling could be enhanced using a waveguide or cavity to promote the interaction of several centers with a common optical mode  @xcite .",
    "transient luminescence and absorption techniques could be used to track the light excitation in time as it moves through the system , and demonstrate behavior consistent with ratcheting .",
    "quantum dots are another system that can exhibit strong optical coupling , and could for example be arranged in sub - wavelength patterns using dna origami  @xcite .",
    "evidence of collective photon emission of lateral quantum dot ensembles has also already been reported @xcite .",
    "of course , the final device likely to be used in a real photocell would be a molecular system .",
    "such systems can be made with high reproducibility , and such that they are very closely spaced with respect to their emission wavelength .",
    "h - aggregates of chromophores have a positive frster coupling that shifts the bright ( absorbing ) state up in energy , as is the case in our model  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , light - harvesting @xmath148-conjugated supramolecular rings can be made with twelve or more repeating units  @xcite , specifically to mimic the ring structures found in biology .",
    "indeed , the symmetry of this structure generates a dark @xmath149 transition in the absence of vibrational distortion  @xcite .",
    "further design optimization of both the individual systems and rigidity of the ring could result in a system ready to meet the requirements for ratcheting ."

    "<S> our choice of @xmath78  ev@xmath79 differs from that in previous works  @xcite : our subtraction of @xmath80 ensures that the highest ( bright state ) level in the first band always remains at 1.8  ev and absorbs at a fixed frequency .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we display the steady - state exciton population of the system without trapping as a function of optical and phonon bath temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the ratchet model to fd , finding that the ratchet enhancement is greatest in the hot photons , cold phonons regime . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected : hot photons quickly promote the system up the excited bands via ratchets , with cold phonons allowing a one - way protection of gained excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> for fd states at low phonon temperature the exciton population plateaus near one , as most population ends up trapped in the state at the bottom of the first band ( see @xcite for the fd data and an extended discussion ) . </S>",

    "<S> the two surfaces cross in the region where the bottleneck is lifted , with ratcheting generating more power for a severe and intermediate bottleneck . the line at which the curves cross is projected onto the bottom ( @xmath82 ) plane of the figure . ]    using the heat engine model , we can now explore the performance of the four site ring as an energy harvester . we will focus on the dependence of the power output on two parameters : the coupling @xmath4 , and extraction rate @xmath76 . for each parameter set , the trap decay rate @xmath62 is varied for maximum power output ; example power traces as a function of @xmath62 can be found the si  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we display the _ absolute _ value of the power generated for the ratchet and np scenarios , whereas in fig .  [ fig4 ] we display the _ relative _ power output of ratchet states over each of the two artificial scenarios . to ensure fair comparison , for np we set the trap energy to be resonant with the bright state at @xmath83 , since the ratchet states at lower energy are inaccessible here . </S>",
    "<S> all three scenarios have lower output power when the trapping ( charge separation ) rates are low , since this creates a bottleneck in the cycle and limits the size of the photocurrent .    however , the ratchet states hold a great advantage over the other scenarios in this bottlenecked region , since this is precisely the situation in which excitations need to be held for some time by the ring before extraction is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the np scenario only performs poorly in this case , since excitations in all likelihood decay before being extracted . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the relative power output of ratcheting over np , shown in the left panel of fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig4 ] , therefore rises to as high as a factor of 35 . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] demonstrates the importance of ratcheting over dark state protection alone , with the ratchet model delivering up to 20  % better performance than fd .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we can see that advantage of ratcheting persists into a region where there is only a moderate bottleneck , i.e. up to @xmath84 . referring to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we see that the ratchet power output in this region is already close to its maximum . </S>",
    "<S> even so , if the extraction rate was arbitrarily tunable , then even a moderate bottleneck could be avoided completely and the main advantage of ratcheting removed . </S>",
    "<S> however , in photosynthesis , creating a fast extraction rate carries with it a clear resource cost : whereas antenna systems can be comparatively ` cheap ' , reaction centres carry a much larger spatial footprint , being typically embedded in membranes and requiring significant surrounding infrastructure ( such as concentration gradients produced by proton pumps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the severity of the bottleneck is likely to be inversely proportional to the number of reaction centres </S>",
    "<S> . a photocell design exploiting ratcheting in the moderate bottleneck regime would be likely then to generate optimal power per unit volume of material  and similar design principles will apply to artificially designed molecular light harvesting systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the choice of interaction strength @xmath4 is also important . </S>",
    "<S> ratcheting achieves optimal results for @xmath85  ev in the bottlenecked region . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence arises because the size of @xmath4 determines the gap between bright and dark or ratchet states . in turn , this controls the effective rate for ` upwards ' phonon - assisted transitions within excitation bands , as those rely on the absorption of a phonon and are proportional to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , larger values of @xmath4 entail more directed dissipation into the lower states of each band , boosting the occupation of ratchet states . however at the same time , increasing @xmath4 leads to a lower ratchet state energy and so a lower trap energy  and hence to a voltage drop . </S>",
    "<S> the trade off between these two competing influences leads to a maximum in ratchet performance .    </S>",
    "<S> as we discuss in detail in the si , ratcheting continues to convey an advantage in the presence of moderate levels of various real - world imperfections , such as site energy disorder , non - radiative recombination , and exciton - exciton annihilation  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> enhancement of power output for ratchet states over np ( left , displayed as a multiplicative factor ) and fd ( right , displayed as a percentage ) , as a function of both hopping strength @xmath4 and extraction rate @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . ]    _ conclusion  _ we have investigated the light harvesting properties of coupled ring structures , inspired by the molecular rings that serve as antennae in photosynthesis . considering a vibrational as well as an electromagnetic environment allows the system to explore the full hilbert space rather than just the restricted subset of dicke ladder states . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the off - ladder states possess interesting and desirable properties , which can be harnessed for enhancing both the current and power of a ring - based photocell device .    </S>",
    "<S> several possible systems  @xcite could be used to observe the effect , from superconducting qubits  @xcite to macrocyclic molecules  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach generalises existing concepts for dark state protection  @xcite to arbitrary numbers of sites and importantly includes multi - exciton states , which introduce the ratcheting effect as a distinct additional mechanism for enhancing the overall light - harvesting performance . </S>",
    "<S> the optical ratchet enhancement is particularly well suited to situations where exciton extraction and conversion represent the bottleneck of a photocell cycle .    in future work </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to explore combining optical ratcheting with enhancements of the primary absorption process , for example by exploiting the phenomena of stimulated absorption  @xcite or superabsorption  @xcite .    </S>",
