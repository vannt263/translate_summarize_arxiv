    "stephan s quintet ( arp  319 ;  sq \" hereafter ) was the first compact group to be discovered in the late 1800 s , and it is probably the best known and most studied dense group at all wavelengths . the original membership identified by @xcite included five , bright , relatively isolated galaxies ( ngc 7317 , 7318a&b , 7319 , and 7320 ) in a tight configuration on the sky .",
    "in addition to their close proximity , three of the spiral members ( ngc 7318a&b , 7319 ) have peculiar or highly distorted optical images that include faint wisps , filaments , and tails . given its high surface brightness ( 22.3 mag arcsec@xmath4 ; * ? ? ? * ) and surface density enhancement ( 593 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is no surprise to find the quintet included among the hickson groups @xcite . while the physical compactness of most hcg s have been challenged ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the optical evidence of recent tidal interactions leaves little doubt that some of the galaxies in the quintet are physically close .",
    "as is typical of hickson groups @xcite , the quintet contains a discordant - redshift member ( ngc 7320 ) . a difference in redshift of nearly 6000 km s@xmath0  between ngc 7320 and the high - redshift members",
    "was first reported by @xcite who concluded that ngc 7320 is either a member of the dense group or a foreground galaxy .",
    "the discovery of the discordant redshift in sq and similar groups such as seyfert s sextet and vv172 @xcite sparked much debate concerning the relationship between the high- and low - redshift galaxies in compact configurations and non - cosmological redshifts .",
    "initially , 21-cm line studies of sq were undertaken mainly with the hope that the radio observations would provide distances independent of redshift , thereby resolving both questions about the group s membership and the existence of non - cosmological redshifts .",
    "@xcite was the first to detect hi emission in the direction of the quintet .",
    "this emission , detected at 800 km s@xmath0 , was associated with ngc 7320 . using the integral properties derived from the hi profile and comparing them with similar properties of field galaxies , @xcite concluded that ngc 7320 is a dwarf galaxy at a distance consistent with its redshift . because allen s study did not resolve the question of group membership , @xcite and @xcite were motivated to search for hi emission from other quintet galaxies that possibly could .",
    "both detected hi emission near 6600 km s@xmath0  which they attributed to ngc 7319 .",
    "after applying the same method used by @xcite , they derived very different distances .",
    "@xcite placed the galaxy at the same distance as ngc 7320 while @xcite found it more likely that ngc 7319 belongs at a distance commensurate with its redshift .",
    "the difference in their distances can be traced to the calibration samples that each adopted .",
    "the main weakness of this method used to derive distances was the underlying assumption that the galaxies in the quintet have normal hi properties for their morphological types and luminosity . using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) ,",
    "@xcite would test this assumption by providing new information on the distribution and kinematics of the hi gas in the quintet .",
    "their observations supported the assumption of normalcy in the location and motion of the low - redshift hi but raised serious doubt about the use of hi profiles as distance indicators when the data showed the gas at 6600 km s@xmath0  in an extended cloud ( 2. @xmath55 @xmath6 4@xmath7 ) not directly associated with any of the members .",
    "the discovery of an isolated cloud in sq was significant because it , alone , changed the focus of subsequent 21-cm line studies .",
    "hi observations more sensitive to extended emission over larger regions of the quintet were undertaken in an effort to understand this anomalous feature in the context of the group s origin and evolution .",
    "sensitive hi searches that used the arecibo telescope found the presence of low level ( 8 mjy ) broadband emission between 5600 and 6600 km s@xmath0",
    "@xcite and two more features extended and offset from the quintet galaxies @xcite . with better angular resolution and sensitivity than the old observations @xcite",
    ", @xcite used the wrst to locate and confirm the three cloud features at 5700 , 6000 and 6600 km s@xmath0  that had been previously detected .",
    "their synthesis observations showed the hi largely outside the optical boundaries of the galaxies in the quintet .",
    "this present study of sq is part of a broader investigation of the distribution and kinematics of hi in the least and most compact associations in the hickson catalog @xcite in order to analyze the type and effect of the interactions that are taking place . if physically dense , hickson groups are natural sites for studying tidal interactions and its effects , galaxy formation and evolution via merging processes , and the dynamical evolution of galaxy groups .",
    "spiral galaxies normally more extended in hi than in starlight are susceptible to tides and direct collisions and ought to be more sensitive to recent interactions .",
    "high resolution imaging of the neutral hydrogen can be used to distinguish between the real and illusory compact groups and may provide a sensitive test of the dynamical evolution of the physically dense groups .",
    "we have analyzed the spatial distributions and kinematics of hi within a subset of 16 groups and proposed an evolutionary scenario where the amount of detected hi would decrease further with evolution , either by continuous tidal stripping and heating or by shocks produced when galaxies penetrate the group s core and interact violently with the interstellar or intergalactic hi in the groups @xcite .",
    "sq , amongst the densest hickson groups , is a vital constituent in this scenario , hence its detailed study would be essential in characterizing the extreme stages in galaxy interactions and group evolution .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that sq is a physical system .",
    "the filaments , tails , and peculiar images of the galaxies are suggestive of interactions .",
    "the distribution of the hi outside the galaxies is consistent with a history of collisional encounters that may have stripped the spiral members of their hi disks @xcite .",
    "why then observe sq with the vla ?",
    "what more had we hoped to learn from hi synthesis observations ?",
    "the wrst @xcite integrated map gives us a clear sense of how the gas between 5700 and 6600 km s@xmath0  is distributed . given the higher angular and velocity resolution of the vla , we saw an opportunity to improve the kinematical description of the hi gas already detected outside of the galaxies . with its higher sensitivity to faint compact emission ,",
    "the vla could detect additional isolated hi clouds within the quintet and possibly resolve any weak hi emission associated with tidal features or still bound to the disks of the individual galaxies .",
    "observations of sq were first made with the vla in its 3 km ( c ) configuration on january 1 , 1991 using all 27 telescopes .",
    "the observational parameters are summarized in table  [ table : obs ] .",
    "additional observations of the hcg  92a ( centered at 782 km s@xmath0 ) and the emission at 5700 km s@xmath0  missed in the original observations were made in the  cs \" configuration , which includes the 3 km baselines and some extra short spacings @xcite . to improve sensitivity to extended , low surface brightness sensitivity ,",
    "additional d - array data were obtained in march 28 , 1999 .",
    "shortest baselines at the shadowing limit of 25 meter are present , and structures as large as 15  in size should be visible in each channel maps .",
    "all of the data are calibrated following the standard vla calibration procedure in aips and imaged using imagr .",
    "absolute uncertainty in the resulting flux scaling is about 15% , and this is the formal uncertainty we quote for all physical parameters derived from the flux density . the synthesized beam is produced using a robust weight of @xmath8 is 19.4@xmath9   @xmath6 18.6@xmath9 .",
    "the resulting spectral - line maps have a velocity resolution of 21.5 km s@xmath0  and an rms noise level of 0.21 mjy ( 0.38 k ) .",
    "the 3@xmath10 hi flux limit in each map is about 0.015 jy km s@xmath0 , corresponding to an hi column density limit of @xmath11 atoms cm@xmath4 . at the adopted distance of the compact group ( 85 mpc ) and at the distance of hcg 92a ( 10 mpc ) , the mass detection limit is @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    ", an unresolved continuum source coincident with the nucleus of ngc 7318a is also clearly detected . a possible detection of a source associated with the nucleus of ngc 7320 is also made ( fig .  [",

    "more importantly , the new continuum image delineates the diffuse emission more clearly than ever before .",
    "the bright radio nucleus of ngc 7319 has a flux density of @xmath18 mjy , in good agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their high - resolution vla data show a short ( 6@xmath9 ) jet - like feature emanating southwestward from the nuclear source in ngc 7319 ( see fig .  3 of * ?",

    "its flux density is @xmath19 mjy .",
    "the radio source coincident with the nucleus of ngc 7318a was only marginally detected ( at the @xmath20 level ) by @xcite .",
    "we confirm their detection of the nuclear radio source in ngc 7318a and find that its flux density is @xmath21 mjy consistent with their measurement . the new continuum image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] ) also shows a 3.6@xmath10 source nearly coincident with the nucleus of ngc 7320 .    the high surface brightness sensitivity achieved by the new observations reveals , for the first time , the faint structure in the extended radio ridge between ngc 7318b and ngc 7319 .",

    "the total flux density associated with the extended radio ridge is @xmath22 mjy , which is at least 60% smaller than that measured by @xcite .",
    "the brightness distribution and the extent of the radio ridge closely follow the extended x - ray emission imaged with rosat @xcite and the extended h@xmath1  emission @xcite . by itself",
    ", the radio continuum emission in the direction of the quintet might be interpreted as a chance superposition of a background core - jet source unrelated to the group ; however , the spatial coincidence of the radio ridge , h@xmath1  emission , and x - ray emission would be unusual , and difficult to explain in radio plumes and rarely detected in radio core - jet sources .",
    "furthermore , the radio continuum emission is less likely to be a random background source since its east - west extension also coincides with h@xmath1  emission at the same mean velocity as the hi gas in the group .",
    "the new vla hi image of ngc  7320 shown in figure  [ fig : h92amomnt]a reveals an unperturbed normal hi disk with a small central depression surrounded by an hi ring or a pair of tightly wound spiral arms . the total extent of the hi disk is 2. @xmath55 @xmath6 1. @xmath55 ( 7.3 kpc@xmath6 4.4 kpc at d = 10 mpc ) comparable in size to the optical image .",

    "although our sensitivity is sufficient to detect clouds with an hi mass of at least @xmath14 , no other hi sources within the 15(45 kpc ) radius region mapped at frequencies near 1417 mhz were detected .",

    "@xcite were the first to provide evidence that ngc 7320 is probably a member of the stable group that includes the supergiant galaxy ngc 7331 .",
    "projected less than 100 kpc away from the center of this galaxy , ngc 7320 is probably a companion to ( if not a satellite of ) this prominent spiral @xcite .",

    "it is mostly contained within five physically distinct components : a large curved feature composed of two arc - like clouds ( arc - s and arc - n ) just east of the quartet and west of ngc 7320c , two kinematically distinct clouds ( nw - lv , nw - hv ) projected along the same direction north of ngc 7318a&b , and one diffuse feature ( sw ) between ngc  7318a&b and ngc 7317 .",

    "when taken together , the unrelated velocity gradients across the low velocity features , i.e. , nw - lv and sw components ( table  [ table : hi ] ) , do not support the @xcite model of a single rotating disk of hi that is gravitationally bound to ngc 7318b .",
    "it is clear from the vla hi data that the lower - velocity gas emanates from two structures that are spatially and kinematically distinct .",
    "the new vla observations improve our understanding of the nature and extent of the atomic gas in sq .",

    "the integrated profiles of nw - lv , nw - hv , sw , arc - s and arc - n , shown in figure [ fig : spec ] , have been reconstructed point by point from the individual channel maps ( figs . [",

    "this asymmetric profile shape is generated by the high - velocity gas in the faint tail behind ngc 7320 where the motions are observed to be very systematic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : arc]b ) .",
    "since the line shape can not be attributed to irregularities in the velocity field , this result suggests that there is more hi in the southeastern end of the tidal tail than toward the northwestern edge where the continuum ridge begins . in region",

    "these motions can be understood if we are observing a sheet - like distribution with its thin axis oriented mostly along the line of sight .",
    "any large - scale motions , if present in this feature , would occur mostly in the plane of the sky and not along the line of sight where random motions are expected to be small given the three - dimensional distribution of tidal features .",

    "the 6000 and 5800 km s@xmath0  velocity components have integrated fluxes that are also lower than their corresponding wsrt or arecibo values , but the difference is much less than that measured for the high velocity gas .",
    "if we are to believe their results , then between 50 and 60% of the flux is missing from the vla observations ; most of which can be attributed to the high - velocity gas .",
    "this large discrepancy can not be accounted for by differences in the sensitivity or in the minimum spatial frequencies sampled by the two arrays .",

    ", sq has been observed with at least five different radio telescopes , three of which are single - dish antennas .",
    "comparisons of the integrated flux measured with smaller single - dish antennas could give some indication of how much flux , if any , was missed with the synthesis array .",
    "figure [ fig : gs ] shows a plot of the integrated flux measurements of the high velocity gas as a function of telescope beam .",
    "we have chosen to compare the high - velocity gas because it was detected in all the published hi observations and given its extended distribution would more likely be affected by the sensitivity limitations and beam attenuation .",
    "the beam areas plotted in figure [ fig : gs ] span roughly 2 orders of magnitude and most of the integrated flux values lie between 3.2 and 6.5 jy km s@xmath0  consistent with the vla measurement given uncertainties in receiver noise , baseline fits to the underlying continuum emission , and flux scale calibrations .",
    "the only measurement in figure [ fig : gs ] commensurate with the higher wsrt value is the one derived from an arecibo composite spectrum ( @xcite ) generated from individual observations made over a grid centered on the group .",
    "their low resolution contour map ( plate 1 ; figure * ? ? ?",

    "none of the emission detected with the vla or with wsrt is observed to be this extended ; however , the arecibo observations are more sensitive , i.e. , @xmath73 mjy arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "if we assume that the arecibo map is representative of the true source brightness , then a velocity width of 280 km s@xmath0  @xcite would give an average brightness of @xmath74 mjy arcsec@xmath4 for the most extended emission .",
    "this is well below the brightness sensitivity of both wsrt and the vla . given similar reported values of the integrated flux , it is difficult to understand how wsrt could have detected the same faint emission present in the arecibo map .    the most sensitive observations with the nrao 91-m telescope ( fig .  [ fig : gs ] )",
    "were made by @xcite ; their hi spectrum has an rms noise per channel of 2.9 mjy which is roughly a factor of 10 higher than the noise in the arecibo spectrum but the nrao 91-m beam is a factor of 10 larger , resulting in a sensitivity @xmath73 arcsec@xmath4 . because the nrao 91-m and the arecibo telescopes have similar sensitivities , the nrao 91-m observations can provide an independent check of the larger arecibo measurement of the integrated flux and a confirmation of the extended emission .",
    "the faint emission present in the arecibo map fills a region that is @xmath75% of the nrao 91-m half - power beam .",
    "@xcite report an integrated flux of 4.8 @xmath34 0.3 jy km s@xmath0  which is consistent with the value measured by @xcite but less than half of the highest reported arecibo measurement .    the faint emission in the arecibo map accounts for 56% of the total integrated flux measured by @xcite .",
    "in order to avoid detection with the nrao 91-m telescope , the faint emission would have to be distributed well outside of the hpbw which is inconsistent with the angular distribution of the high - velocity gas in both the wsrt and arecibo maps .",
    "although sensitive to the faint emission in the arecibo map , the nrao 91-m telescope is unable to confirm this detection and raises doubts about whether the 8 k km s@xmath0  emission present in the arecibo is real or an artifact of beam smearing .",
    "it is worth noting that emission as bright as 16 k km s@xmath0  in the arecibo map matches in angular extent the hi detected with both the vla and wsrt and has an integrated flux of 4.8 jy km s@xmath0   consistent with the measurements made with both the vla and the nrao 91-m telescope .    in summary ,",
    "the observed line widths of the components detected in the direction of the quintet are all very small less than 270 km s@xmath0 .",
    "their angular extent tends to correlate inversely with line width , i.e. , the most compact component , nw - hv , has the largest line width , while the most extended feature ,",
    "arc - n , has the smallest ( table  [ table : hi ] ) .",
    "this correlation may be related to how dynamically evolved each feature is .",
    "nw - hv is coincident with that of known h@xmath1  emission regions or dwarf galaxy candidates @xcite and its larger line width may be an indication of a local density enhancement and a deeper gravitational potential .",
    "the integrated fluxes measured with the vla are all lower than their corresponding wsrt values .",
    "there is more than a factor of two difference between the two measurements of the high - velocity gas near 6600 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this discrepancy can not be explained by differences in sensitivity or in the limitations on the minimum spatial frequencies that can be mapped by each instrument .",
    "in contrast , the vla measurement of the total integrated flux is in good agreement with single - dish measurements made with arecibo , nancay , and the nrao 91-m telescopes .",

    "the new observations at higher angular and velocity resolutions than any published results to date provide far more details about the internal motions of the hi gas in sq and allow direct comparisons between hi emission and other discrete and extended sources within the group over a range of wavelengths , i.e. , x - ray , optical , h@xmath1 , continuum , and infrared .",
    "the higher resolution of the vla has provided us with additional clues about the short - term consequences of collisions and interactions as well as the dynamical history of the high - redshift members in the quintet .",

    "the large velocity difference of ngc  7318b with respect to the rest of the group ( @xmath83 km s@xmath0 ) has been taken as key evidence for its being an intruder passing through the group .",
    "a collision at such a high velocity would result in wide - spread shocked and ionized regions , followed by rapid cooling due to the emission of radiation at uv- and x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the radio continuum ridge found east of ngc  7318b has been suggested to be the interface between the interloper and the group because the shocked , ionized gas is predicted to produce significant amounts of synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron life time for the radiating electrons is estimated to be rather short , a few times @xmath84 years , which is comparable to the crossing time for such a collision .",
    "presence of extended , diffuse x - ray emission associated with the group @xcite also raises the possibility that what is seen in sq is the result of a collision between a galaxy and a hot group medium .",
    "given the @xmath85 dependence on emissivity , such a collision should be much less effective in producing radio continuum emission than in a collision involving two galaxy disks .",
    "a logical place to look for such an example is the centers of nearby clusters such as virgo and the coma cluster , and ngc  4522 may be an example of such a collision between diffuse cluster / group medium and a galactic disk @xcite .",
    "though plausible , such objects are rare in clusters , and the tenuous intra - group medium in sq would weaken the case considerably .",
    "the excellent surface brightness sensitivity achieved by our new observations reveals several new details for the first time , including the faint structure in the extended radio ridge between ngc  7318b and ngc  7319 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : cont ] , the continuum ridge approximately follows the optical tails .",
    "the new continuum image also raises minor issues for the hypothesis that the extended radio continuum ridge , also visible in x - ray and h@xmath1 , is the product of a collision involving ngc  7318b . because ngc  7318b sits in the middle of the ridge its trajectory has to be mainly in the direction perpendicular to the extent of the ridge ; however , the shape of the radio ridge is s - shaped and not the expected symmetric c - shape of a bow - shock .",
    "a careful comparison of radio continuum and h@xmath1   images by @xcite shown in figure  [ fig : ridge ] reveals some important differences .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath1  emission is indeed c - shaped , more in line with the shock hypothesis .",
    "this apparent discrepancy may be resolved at least in part by the difference in the radiation time scales .",
    "the cooling time for the h@xmath1  emitting gas is much shorter than the synchotron lifetime for the radio emitting electrons , and h@xmath1  is tracing only the most active , ongoing shocked regions .",
    "there is also some evidence that more than one source of h@xmath1   emission may be present .",
    "the continuum subtracted line image centered at 6738   ( including both h@xmath1  and [ n ii ] emission ) by @xcite resembles our radio continuum image more closely , and the radio continuum may be tracing mainly the ionized gas at a the higher velocity ( i.e. 6600 km s@xmath0 ) as shown in figure 2 of @xcite .    the striking morphological alignment between h@xmath1  and the hi features near 6600 km s@xmath0 shown on the right panel in figure  [ fig : ridge ] raises an intriguing possibility that ngc  7318b may be colliding with part of the hi tidal tail of arc - s that runs behind ngc  7320 .",
    "implicit in this hypothesis is that this hi tail may be linked with the nw - hv feature , and the missing segment in hi may be fully ionized and visible only in h@xmath1  and in radio continuum .",
    "the recession velocity of the ionized gas in the southern parts of the h@xmath1  filament measured by @xcite is around 6600 km s@xmath0 , consistent with this scenario .",
    "further , the broad linewidth ( @xmath86 km s@xmath0 ) measured by @xcite is also consistent with such a collision scenario .",
    "examples of close correspondence between h@xmath1  emission and hi are found throughout sq ( see   [ sec : hidist ] ) .",
    "the two prominent star - forming complexes identified in mid - ir by @xcite are associated with two bright h@xmath1  complexes , and they both coincide with the two highest hi column density peaks ( arc - n and nw - hv ) . the hi peaks in the nw - hv , nw - lv , and the sw features all have associated h@xmath1  features , and the molecular gas complexes traced in co by @xcite and by @xcite are also associated with h@xmath1  features detected by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "frequent tidal encounters in high density regions are thought to be conducive to star - formation activity , and indeed evidence for induced star - formation activity is ubiquitous everywhere in sq where cold gas is found .",
    "the star - formation activity , however , is not as spectacular as one might expect as in isolated environments such as in interacting pairs .",
    "star formation is known to have a non - linear dependence on gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and few high density regions are currently present in sq and little cold gas is remaining in the individual galaxies .",
    "these trends of low gas content and ubiquitous but suppressed star - formation activity are commonly found in our examination of a large sample of hickson compact groups @xcite .      the improved sensitivity and resolution of the new vla data",
    "have significantly improved our understanding of the nature and distribution of the hi tidal features in sq ( see   [ sec : hidist ] ) . the massive l - shaped hi arc located about @xmath87 ( 75 kpc ) east of sq",
    "is shown to be possibly consisting of two separate tidal features ( arc - n and arc - s in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] ) , in accordance with the two optical tails seen .",
    "most of the gas in arc - n is located near the end of the long sinuous tail emanating from ngc 7319 .",
    "while arc - n appears to originate from ngc  7319 , the origin of the southern tail is uncertain .",
    "both of the nw clouds are located near the tips of 2 crossing optical features north of ngc 7318a&b .",
    "the two nw features are quite distinct in velocity , but they appear spatially coincident exactly within our resolution",
    ". therefore the two may be physicaly related .",
    "the sw feature at 5700 km s@xmath0  is shown to be a distinct feature consisting of 2 - 3 clumps .",
    "if only its velocity field is considered , it might be an independent dynamical entity , such as a dwarf galaxy ( see   [ sec : sw ] ) .",
    "one of the clear conclusions that can be drawn from the new data is that the 5700 km s@xmath0  feature and 6000 km s@xmath0  feature are clearly not the tidally disrupted disk of ngc  7318b as proposed by @xcite .",
    "in fact , none of the hi features are clearly associated with any of the individual galaxies .",
    "it is conceivable that in the past the two features could have been part of a single structure , possibly related to ngc  7318b , and separated into two distinct features forming the components we see today .",
    "such a separation can not be a direct outcome of a tidal disruption because _ everything _ within the tidal radius , including gas and stars , should have responded identically to the tidal shear . to the contrary",
    ", the core of the optical galaxy appears intact .",
    "the suggestion that ngc  7318b may be passing through the group for the first time @xcite is certainly unlikely , especially if the observed x - ray , h@xmath1 , and radio continuum ridge is the evidence for the ongoing collision , because tidal damages due to such a collision , particularly the removal of outer gas and stellar disk and the development of the characteristic tidal tails , should form only after the closest encounter .",
    "physical separation by a direct collision , though naively attractive , is not a likely explanation because one can not simply slice a gas cloud into two pieces .",
    "the face - on collision involving two disk galaxies in the `` taffy '' pair resulted in only a slight re - arrangement and displacement of the hi in both disks @xcite , without producing any dramatic consequences of the type speculated here .",
    "the general proximity and relative orientation of ngc  7320c with respect to the optical and hi tails have been invoked as evidence for its recent passage through sq and possibly as an explanation for the northern optical tail that appears to originate from ngc  7319 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite et al",
    ". even speculated that the two tidal tails might be the products of two consecutive passages by ngc  7320c .",
    "as clearly seen in various numerical studies of galaxy interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , each passage by a companion generally erases all pre - existing features such as spiral arms and tidal tails , and such an explanation for the pair of tidal tails is probably not physical .",
    "another common tendency seen in numerical simulations is that tidal tails generally points back to the responsible culprit because the tidal debris and the passing companion have exchanged momentum , putting them in similar trajectories about the primary .",
    "this means the northern hi tail , at least the bulk of the segment pointing due north , _ can not be primarily driven by ngc  7320c_. the origin for the older ( more diffuse and thicker ) southern tail is also quite uncertain .",
    "the number of faint neighbors with similar radial velocities as the galaxies in sq is evidence that the quartet is not well isolated from the larger field of galaxies ( see   [ sec : neighbors ] ) .",
    "therefore interlopers may pass through and disturb the group with some frequency , including its hi companions such as anon .",
    "4 . resulting dynamical heating may be sustaining the group from collapsing @xcite , contrary to the prediction by @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of such a scenario is that interpreting the observed tidal features is no longer straightforward as in interacting galaxy pairs .",
    "the high galaxy density in core of the group also means that any galaxy passing through the group is subject to multiple scatterings rather than following a simple trajectory , and extrapolating the intuitions derived from the numerical studies of interacting pairs should be exercised with great caution .",
    "an entirely different scenario one might consider , for at least parts of the observed hi features such as the large arc feature , is that these are remnants of the primordial gas clouds where the group has formed out of or tidal debris formed during the initial formation of the group , similar to the leo ring found around the m96 group @xcite .",
    "the leo ring is a nearly complete ring of hi with a diameter of about 200 kpc , thought to be orbiting the galaxies m105 ( e0 ) and ngc  3384 ( sb0 ) with a period of @xmath88 years .",
    "when examined at the same hi column density level of @xmath89 cm@xmath4 shown in figure  [ fig : tot ] , both the leo ring and the hi arc feature are partial rings of hi of @xmath90 kpc in size with linear velocity gradient perpendicular to their lengths .",
    "they both surround a group of galaxies interior to the ring , and their systemic velocities match the galaxy group velocity .",
    "one significant difference is that at least parts of the hi arc in sq have stellar counterparts , which rejects the primordial origin .",
    "the possibility that these rings of hi are remnants of group formation process , older than the group crossing time still seems plausible .",
    "using c , cs , and d arrays of the vla , we imaged five kinematically distinct hi clouds , a diffuse extended continuum ridge , and the disks of ngc 7320 , and 3 faint dwarf galaxies in the direction of sq .",
    "the most massive of the four clouds previously detected and confirmed by us is resolved into two separate systems which accounts for the five clouds we report here .",
    "the two largest hi features east of the continuum ridge are coincident with and concentrated along the two large tidal tails that extend toward the direction of the ngc 7320c .",
    "the two compact hi sources , west of the continuum ridge , have hi emission that peaks along the same line of sight and includes luminous infrared and bright h@xmath1  sources probably indicative of star - formation activity in the densest regions of the gas .",
    "the fifth cloud , south of ngc 7318a&b , consists of two major clumps , one coincides with the tidal features south of ngc 7318a and the other is devoid of any detectable stellar or h@xmath1  sources . as in previous hi studies ,",
    "no emission was detected at the positions of any high - redshift galaxies including ngc 7320c ; any hi still bound to their disks must be quite small , i.e , less than @xmath3 .",
    "we do not confirm the amount of hi previously reported in sq .",
    "the total amount of hi detected by the vla between 5597 and 6755 km s@xmath0  is roughly @xmath91 which is a factor of 2 lower than that reportedly detected by wsrt .",
    "most of this difference can be attributed to the integrated flux of the high velocity cloud features .",
    "the discrepancy can not be explained by significant differences in the instrumental performance of the two arrays and we suspect that it is related to the quality and processing of the wsrt data which probably was compromised by low residual radar interference and unstable levels in the continuum emission .",
    "we are more confident in the vla measurements because the data were free from these effects and the value of the integrated flux of the high velocity gas is consistent with independent single - dish measurements obtained with smaller antennas .",
    "the optical , x - ray , and radio continuum emission leaves little doubt that recent interactions have occurred in sq .",
    "the radio continuum ridge visible in x - ray and h@xmath1  is the strongest evidence of a gaseous collision . but a collision between what two objects or components ?",
    "ngc 7318b has been identified as the prime intruder and collision suspect because it brings enough kinetic energy into the group to shock and ionize the gas .",
    "the continuum ridge in sq , truly impressive in its scale , is about a factor of 4 larger than the radio bridge between the `` taffy '' pair and exceeds the angular size of any of the bright galaxies in sq . given the large scale of the radio ridge , we favor the hypothesis that the hi tidal tail behind ngc 7320 originally filled the region connecting arc - s and nw - hv and that a collision between ngc 7318b and this tidal tail fully ionized the hi intragroup gas now detectable as the h@xmath1 x - ray , and radio continuum ridge .",
    "the intruder theory is attractive for three reasons : 1 ) there is a supply of faint hi - rich galaxies @xmath92 from sq s center ; 2 ) the energy that the intruder deposits via interactions can be transformed into the thermal and nonthermal forms we observed in sq ; and 3 ) this source of energy can support the group against rapid ( a few crossing times ) collapse .    unfortunately , there is no well - defined interaction scenario that can explain the hi tidal features in sq because none of the clouds are clearly linked with any of the bright galaxies .",
    "some of the gas in arc - n is at the end of a tidal tail that appears to emanate from ngc 7319 but the original source of hi in arc - s is uncertain .",
    "the two nw features both strategically located near the tips of two tidal tails have systemic velocities very close to those of ngc 7318 a&b and could be physically associated with their northern tails as @xcite suggest .",
    "the sw feature is the only cloud that has a projected separation that is close to the one bright galaxy sharing a similar systemic velocity and this hi feature is found also at the end of a tidal tail / arm .",
    "numerical simulations of @xcite have shown that large pools of gas can develop at the tip of tidal tails during a single encounter between two galaxies . when taken together ,",
    "the conspicuous sites of the hi clouds in sq are consistent with the predicted location of tidally - liberated gas that has the potential to develop into dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is difficult to trace the culprit(s ) involved in the interactions when the galaxies have undergone multiple scatterings as a result of their high number density .",
    "we must be cautious about inferences based on the results of numerical studies of interacting pairs when there are multiple interactions because these interpretations are probably not completely valid in this case .",
    "intergalactic hi clouds with masses greater than @xmath93 are extremely rare as numerous null searches @xcite in nearby groups of galaxies have revealed and yet , sq contains multiple cloud features clearly distinct from the disk of the luminous galaxies with no detectable levels of hi .",
    "given the rarity of intergalactic hi clouds and the evidence of interactions ( two large optical tidal tails , diffuse light surrounding the group , the radio continuum ridge , hi - deficient galaxies ) , a natural explanation for the hi is that its origin is tidal .",
    "the only other known group with as many cloud features as sq is g11 @xcite or gwa @xcite , the nearby compact group that contains the leo hi cloud complex .",
    "the general morphology of the two cloud complexes is similar in their relative dimensions , clumpiness , and ring - like shape .",
    "but unlike the intergalactic hi ring in leo where there is no hint of diffuse stellar emission , the clouds in sq are projected along the same directions as the blue and red diffuse stellar emission @xcite that surrounds the entire group .",
    "in addition , the high density regions of the hi are decorated with numerous h@xmath1  sources indicative of the current star - forming activity .",
    "there are some clumps of hi devoid of diffuse emission and h@xmath1  sources so that we can not dismiss the possibility that some of the gas in sq is primordial and remnants of the group formation process .",
    "the origin of the hi features in sq still remains unresolved .",
