    "fossil groups are galaxy systems optically dominated by an elliptical galaxy immersed in an extended and luminous x - ray halo ( l@xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ergs@xmath3 ) , in which the magnitude gap between the two brightest galaxies within half of the virial radius is greater than 2 in the @xmath0 band @xcite . the scarcity of l@xmath9 galaxies and the evidence for the existence of a  massive \" structure traced by the hot intragroup gas support the hypothesis of their central galaxies being formed by merging of luminous galaxies , most likely by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "the estimated time scales for dynamical friction and results of numerical simulations are consistent with an old age for fossil groups .",
    "for example , @xmath10-body / hydrodynamical simulations carried out by @xcite suggest a correlation between the magnitude gap between the two brightest galaxies and the formation time of the group . more recently",
    "several studies of simulated fossil groups were made using the millennium simulations @xcite which corroborated the idea that fossil groups / clusters assembled most of their masses much earlier than non - fossil systems .",
    "these studies also predicted a fraction of 3%13% of groups with masses greater than 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 being fossil groups , depending on the exact range of masses considered .    the true nature of fossil groups has promoted a lively debate in the past decade .",
    "the absence of a conclusive explanation for the nature of these objects is mainly due to ( 1 ) the lack of a proper sample for statistical studies , ( 2 ) the lack of x - ray data with sufficient resolution and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for a proper study of the group properties , and ( 3 ) the lack of optical spectroscopy of the group members , for membership confirmation and a study of the kinematic properties of the known groups .",
    "a growing number of fossil group candidates has been claimed in the recent literature .",
    "for example , @xcite identified 34 potential candidate fossil groups in a systematic search carried out using the _ sloan digital sky survey _",

    "if the ring had less than 10 galaxies , then we increased the width of the ring until we reached this minimum value .",
    "this analysis may reveal the degree of anisotropy present in the group .    in both figures we can see an increase in the average velocity and velocity dispersion for radii larger than 16 arcmin ( @xmath2 650 @xmath54kpc ) .",
    "this increment probably is due to the presence of the three major galaxy clusters in the region .",

    "according to the relations for groups and clusters from @xcite and @xcite , we find that for the x - ray luminosity of ngc 6034 group it is expected a velocity dispersion of about 425 kms@xmath3 , in good agreement with our direct measurement of 410 kms@xmath3 ( when we include all galaxies in the group ; or 360 kms@xmath3 when only the non - emission - line galaxies are included ) . on the other hand , a velocity dispersion of @xmath2 450 kms@xmath3",

    "however , the kmm - test @xcite rejects a gaussian velocity distribution at the 99.5% level , and the distribution reveals clearly two structures ",
    "s1 , the ugc 842 group , and s2  with a velocity dispersion of about 230 kms@xmath3 each ( see figure [ fig : veldist_ugc ] and table [ tab : vel ] ) .",
    "the fact that the bolometric x - ray luminosity of ugc 842 fits well in the l@xmath88-t@xmath88 relation , the measured sigma for the group is too low in the l@xmath88@xmath1 and t@xmath88@xmath1 group relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ugc 842 seems to be too luminous and too hot , with a @xmath4 of @xmath21.9 kev @xcite , for its sigma .",
    "the expected x - ray temperature for s1 and s2 from their velocity dispersion is around 0.51 kev , and the superposition of both plasmas in the line of sight does not imply in the detection of a temperature as high as @xmath4@xmath21.9kev .",
    "although not too pronounced , similar behavior has also been observed in other fossil groups @xcite .",
    "in fact , this high value for the temperature of ugc 842 is in line with the suggestion of @xcite that both temperature and x ray luminosity has been boosted for fossil groups compared to the values for `` normal '' groups with similar velocity dispersions , given their early times of formation .",
    "another possibility we envisage is that the galaxies have lower relative velocities in fossil groups given that they have lost energy by dynamical friction in the process of spiraling towards the group center for interacting and finally merging .",
    "the radial velocity difference between the peaks of the velocity distribution of s1 and s2 ( @xmath2 820 kms@xmath3 ; see section [ sct : veldist ] ) suggests that the two groups are simply overlapping in the line of sight .",
    "although the smooth appearance of the x - ray image @xcite agrees with this hypothesis , we think the snr of the x - ray observation can not rule out the presence of x - ray substructures that could indicate a recent interaction of the two sub - groups . better s / n and spatial resolution x - ray data may reveal if there is an interaction between the two groups ( s1 or s2 ) or not .",
    "thus , the measured temperature of @xmath4 @xmath2 1.9 kev for ugc 842 may either represent the intragroup medium of the most massive group , s1 , or it could be the result of an interaction between s1 and s2 . both possibilities make ugc 842 especially interesting in the study of formation and evolution of fossil groups .",

    "<S> we present a new insight on ngc 6034 and ugc 842 , two groups of galaxies previously reported in the literature as being fossil groups . </S>",
    "<S> the study is based on optical photometry and spectroscopy obtained with the ctio blanco telescope and sloan digital sky survey archival data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ngc 6034 is embedded in a large structure , dominated by three rich clusters and other small groups . </S>",
    "<S> its first and next four ranked galaxies have magnitude differences in the @xmath0 band and projected distances which violate the optical criteria to classify it as a fossil group . we confirm that the ugc 842 group is a fossil group , but with about half the velocity dispersion that is reported in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity distribution of its galaxies reveals the existence of two structures in its line of sight , one with @xmath1 @xmath2 223 kms@xmath3 and another with @xmath1 @xmath2 235 kms@xmath3 , with a difference in velocity of @xmath2 820 kms@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the main structure is dominated by passive galaxies , while these represent @xmath2 60% of the second structure . the x - ray temperature for the intragroup medium of a group with such a velocity dispersion is expected to be @xmath4 @xmath2 0.51 kev , against the observed value of @xmath4 @xmath2 1.9 kev reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this result makes ugc 842 a special case among fossil groups because ( 1 ) it represents more likely the interaction between two small groups , which warms the intragroup medium and/or ( 2 ) it could constitute evidence that member galaxies lost energy in the process of spiraling toward the group center , and decreased the velocity dispersion of the system . as far as we know , ugc 842 is the first low - mass fossil group studied in detail . </S>"
