    "the rising envelope of r.m.s .  for bright stars with @xmath21 is due to ccd non - linearity effects for stars approaching saturation ( @xmath22 ) , and so we limit our period search to stars with @xmath23 ( see below ) .",

    "for example , the _ chandra _ orion ultradeep project ( coup ) found the rate of contaminants ( due to foreground / background field stars and extragalactic sources ) to be @xmath2610% @xcite .",

    "we determined the mean offsets between the two astrometric systems for each of our fields , which are listed in table  [ tab : xrayoffsets ] ( where offsets are positionally calculated as damiani@xmath28ours ) , and corrected our astrometry to place all of the stars onto the @xcite system .",

    "the sample stars span a range of inferred masses @xmath32 .",
    "we use the vartools light curve analysis program @xcite to search for periods in our light curves , employing the lomb - scargle ( ls ) period search algorithm @xcite . because the temporal baseline of our light curves is 35 days ,",
    "we restrict the search to periods shorter than 20  d , i.e.  just over 50% of the baseline .",
    "we also limit the search to periods longer than 0.1  d , corresponding to the nyquist limit given our typical sampling frequency of @xmath330.05  d ( see  [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we first clipped the light curve data with iterative 3-sigma outlier rejection and then selected only those periods whose peaks in the resulting ls periodogram satisfied a signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath34__snr__@xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation with our observed light curves to determine the false - alarm probability ( fap ) of the periods we detect . following the procedures described in @xcite , for each star",
    "we generate 10,000 synthetic light curves from which we empirically determine the distribution of peak heights in the ls power spectrum that would arise from noise .",
    "we then compare the height of the peak in the star s observed ls power spectrum to this distribution of peak heights to determine the fap .",
    "each of the 10,000 synthetic light curves consists of two sources of noise .",
    "the first is the point - to - point scatter in the photometry which we simulate by scrambling the star s actual light curve data .",
    "the second is a correlated noise with a timescale of 1  d , whose amplitude we estimate from the standard deviation of nightly means from the star s light curve .",
    "the former preserves the specific noise distribution and the time sampling pattern of the actual data for each star , while the latter gives the synthetic light curves the freedom to vary on timescales that are long compared to our sampling interval , allowing them to mimic any slow variability of stellar origin ( such as accretion activity ) that could produce spurious periodic behavior that would be misinterpreted as a rotation period .",
    "we consider `` definite '' rotation periods to be those with fap  @xmath36  0.001 .",
    "in other words , these stars ls power spectra evince peaks whose strengths occur by chance in 10 or fewer of the 10,000 noise light curves .",
    "as our master sample includes 662 stars , we therefore expect at most @xmath01 false positive period .",
    "in addition , we consider `` possible '' rotation periods to be those with 0.001  @xmath26  fap  @xmath36  0.01 . throughout our analysis",
    "we generally only utilize the definite rotation period stars , but we include the possible rotation period stars here for the benefit of future follow - up studies .    from our master sample of 662 cluster members",
    "we find 256 definite periods and 47 possible periods . finally , for the remainder of our analysis , we include only those stars included in the optical catalog of @xcite , for which we have estimated stellar masses and ages .",
    "this yields a final catalog of 244 cluster members with definite periods and 46 with possible periods .",
    "the sample of 244 definite periods represents the successful detection of periods for one - third of the @xcite x - ray catalog of ngc 6530 cluster members .",
    "the full catalogs of cluster members with definite and possible rotation periods are in tables  [ tab : defparms ] and  [ tab : possparms ] , respectively , along with all of the associated data that we have gleaned from the literature ( see  [ sec : litdata ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc.perdef.01 ] shows the phase - folded light curves of the 244 definite rotators , ordered by increasing period .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc.perposs.01 ] shows the same for the 46 possible rotators .",
    "the definite and possible rotators are also highlighted in the cmd shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "our sample of rotators span the range @xmath37 .",
    "note that many stars with high r.m.s .",
    "are not identified here as rotation period detections because they were not identified as cluster members in the x - ray study of @xcite ; future investigations of cluster membership would enable an even larger sample of rotation period determinations for ngc 6530 from our light curves .",
    "we quantify our period detection sensitivity and any biases as functions of period and stellar brightness .",
    "we use 1000 of the non - variable stars in our full data set , and that are in in the same magnitude range as our rotators , as a control sample . for each star",
    "we inject sinusoids with amplitude in the range @xmath38 , typical for our sample of rotators ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc.perdef.01 ] ) , into the light curves with periods in the range 0.120  d and run the vartools ls period search algorithm using the same criteria as above .",
    "we consider the period successfully recovered if it agrees with the input period to within 10% , which is an acceptable margin of error in the rotation periods for the purposes of our analysis below .",
    "some of the observed light curves for our sample of rotators show modest departures from sinusoidal shapes ( see fig.[fig : lc.perdef.01 ] ) , but we expect any resultant errors in the periods to be within the 10% tolerance that we adopt for this test .    figure  [ fig : detecteff]a shows the fraction of correctly recovered periods as a function of input period , while figure  [ fig : detecteff]b shows the fraction of correctly recovered periods as a function of @xmath18 magnitude .",
    "we find that our period detection efficiency is roughly constant at @xmath3390% for the full range of rotation periods tested .",
    "thus , while this simulation suggests we are missing @xmath010% of the true underlying population of rotators , with variability amplitudes larger than 0.02 mag , we infer no strong biases in the rotation period distribution as a function of period . at the same time",
    ", there is a strong bias against period detection for the bright stars with @xmath39 , clearly the result of the higher r.m.s .  in our light curves for the brightest stars ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) . for fainter stars",
    "the detection efficiency is approximately 100% , and thus the @xmath010% loss of efficiency seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : detecteff]a is entirely a consequence of the brighter stars .",
    "however , again , fig .",
    "[ fig : detecteff]a indicates that this loss of efficiency is largely independent of period , and thus we expect no strong biases in the period distribution of our sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : detecteff]c shows that our detection efficiency is also independent of amplitude over this range .",
    "we also performed a simulation with injected amplitudes as low as 0.002 mag and found that our sensitivity remained high down to @xmath40 mag .",
    "however , given the simple nature of these simulations ( e.g.  we inject perfectly sinusoidal signals ) , we conservatively assume that we are not sensitive to periodic variations below @xmath00.02 mag given the @xmath00.01 mag precision in the photometry .    finally , we note that 21 of the 244 stars in the definite rotator group have been previously identified as candidate spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ; see table  [ tab : defparms ] ) . in these cases",
    "it is possible that the periodicity we observe is related to the binary orbit but not to the rotation of the star(s ) , or that the rotation of the star dominating the light has been affected by the presence of a close faint companion star .",
    "we do not attempt to correct for these possibilities , but note here that these sb2s constitute less than 10% of our sample and are not concentrated at specific rotation periods , so we do not expect these to alter our results .",
    "we do comment on specific interesting cases below .",
    "we note that those sb2s with shorter periods could potentially be non - member field contaminants .",
    "our catalog of members with rotation periods is x - ray - selected , and tidally - locked short - period binaries in the foreground might display enhanced x - ray emission that would mimic that of cluster members .",
    "we employ two standard statistical tests to examine possible differences or trends in the rotation periods as a function of various stellar properties : the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , which determines the probability that two samples were drawn from the same parent distribution , and the student s @xmath41 test , which determines the probability that two samples possess identical means . for a given stellar property ( e.g.  mass )",
    ", we divide the period distribution into two bins ( e.g.  low - mass and high - mass ) and apply these statistical tests on the rotation periods of the two bins . in all of the statistical comparisons below we include only stars with definite rotation periods as defined above ( see  [ sec : persearch ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : perhist ] shows the rotation period distribution of our entire sample of 244 cluster members with definite periods .",
    "the masses and ages for these stars from @xcite using the pms evolutionary tracks of @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : masshist ] .",
    "the typical star in our sample is inferred to have @xmath42 @xmath00.6  m@xmath43 and age @xmath02  myr according to these tracks ( but see  [ sec : disc ] for a detailed discussion of the likely age of the cluster ) .",
    "correlations between the rotation periods and these masses and ages are discussed below .",
    "the distribution is roughly flat for @xmath44 d. a peak is apparent near @xmath45 d , which may suggest that some aliasing effects at the diurnal sampling frequency of the light curves is still present . despite this ,",
    "a one - sided ks test comparing the observed distribution with a uniform distribution for @xmath44 d yields a probability of 18% that the two distributions represent the same parent population .",
    "thus , the null hypothesis  a uniform distribution in this case  is not rejected by the observed period distribution .",
    "we observe two clear cutoffs in the period distribution , despite our good sensitivity to periodic signals for periods both longer and shorter than the observed cutoffs . at the long period end",
    ", the distribution tapers off strongly for @xmath46 d. this is very similar to the observed long - period cutoff in the distributions of other young clusters , such as the onc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we use the reddening - free index of nir excess , @xmath29 @xcite , to segregate our sample according to the likelihood that they possess massive circumstellar disks . those stars that are identified in @xcite as having a high @xmath29 value display significant ir emission relative to their optical color , and we adopt their same classifications to indicate which stars harbor a circumstellar disk . we note that @xmath29 is a fairly crude measure of nir excess , and certainly does not yield information on disk structure . stars without large @xmath29 index values may still possess disks , for example , if the disk has an evacuated inner hole .",

    "figure  [ fig : perhist.qvijk]a offers a visual comparison of this result .",
    "while those stars with no nir excess are concentrated at faster periods , those with nir excess are more uniformly distributed and exhibit a significant long - period component .",

    "the distribution of rotation periods we have measured for ngc  6530 is consistent with a uniform distribution for @xmath1  d ; we do not observe obvious bimodality in the period distribution .",

    "these features of the ngc  6530 period distribution and its dependence on stellar mass differ strongly from the trends discussed above for numerous other clusters with ages @xmath41  myr .",
    "we find that ngc  6530 stars with older isochrone ages rotate more slowly on average than their younger counterparts .",
    "the statistical significance of this trend is not strong , but as with the other rotational properties of ngc 6530 noted above , such a trend is in contrast with that expected from the longer - term evolution observed between other extensively - studied young clusters , which show a tendency for stars to spin up modestly between the age of the onc and that of the pleiades .",
    "these differences in rotational characteristics between ngc 6530 and the other young clusters might be understood if ngc 6530 represents a population of pms stars that is significantly younger than the other clusters , such that in particular the higher mass stars in the cluster are having their period distribution shaped from a unimodal one into a bimodal one , and the lowest mass stars in the cluster are actively spinning up so that they will end up spinning faster than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "that is , the ngc 6530 stars are perhaps currently evolving toward an evolutionary state when their rotational properties would presumably resemble those of the onc . indeed , the age of ngc 6530 has been estimated by @xcite to be similar to , and possibly slightly younger than , the onc .    in an attempt to more firmly place ngc 6530 in an evolutionary context relative to other well studied young clusters , and motivated by the findings of @xcite who suggested patterns with age in the mass  period relationship of young clusters , we show in figure  [ fig : permassclusters ] the rotation periods as a function of stellar mass for ngc 6530 and five other young clusters with extant rotation period measurements .",

    "however , it is not clear that disk - locking models actually predict such a correlation of increased nir excess for slow rotators .",
    "a central prediction of most disk - locking models is that the location of the inner truncation radius of the circumstellar disk relative to the co - rotation radius determines the magnitude and sign of the torque experienced by the star .",
    "thus for slow rotators , whose co - rotation radii are large and for which a braking torque would therefore require an even larger inner truncation radius , one might predict less nir emission for the slow rotators due to the large inner hole in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite performed detailed modeling of the spectral energy distributions of stars in ic  348 with measured rotation periods in order to assess in detail for each star the location of the inner disk edge relative to co - rotation .",
    "those authors found that the slow rotators in ic  348 tended to possess disks with inner truncation radii at or beyond co - rotation , whereas the rapidly rotating stars tended to posses disks with inner truncation radii within co - rotation , implying that if star - disk interaction is important for the stars then it must be operating with a tendency to torque down the slow rotators and torque up the rapid rotators .",
    "in other words , if disks are important for angular momentum evolution in that cluster , then they must be important for stars at all rotation periods , spinning down some stars while spinning up others .",
    "thus , inferring the nature of any star - disk interaction among our sample of rotators in ngc 6530 awaits detailed modeling of the spectral energy distributions of the stars in order to establish whether and how disks may be sculpting the ngc 6530 rotation period distribution .",

    "the distribution of rotation periods in ngc 6530 is approximately uniform over the range @xmath1  d ; we do not observe obvious bimodality in the period distribution , regardless of whether the distribution is considered in its entirety or limited to narrower ranges of stellar mass .",

    "main - sequence contact binary systems .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the stars are roughly flat with rotation period , at approximately the saturation level ( @xmath2 ) . however , the fastest rotators show lower average x - ray luminosities , at a highly statistically significant level , suggestive of so - called  super saturation . \" at the same time , x - ray luminosity correlates most strongly with the stars co - rotation radii , suggesting that centrifugal stripping of the coronae may be the fundmental driver of the super saturation phenomenon .",
    "stars with nir excesses and h@xmath8 emission indicative of warm circumstellar material rotate more slowly on average than stars lacking disk signatures . disked stars",
    "might be presumed to be younger on average , and indeed we find evidence that stars with younger ages as inferred from spatial location within the cluster rotate more slowly on average . however , the statistical significance is low , and indeed we find the opposite association between rotation and age when the ages are inferred from pms isochrones .",
    "the rotation periods are a function of stellar mass : the lower mass stars rotate more slowly on average than the higher mass stars .",
    "this is in the opposite sense of the period - mass relationship observed in the onc and in all other slightly older clusters .",
    "we show that the slope of the mass - period relationship among slow rotators ( defined as the 75%-ile rotation periods ) in the mass range @xmath91 is a good proxy for the age of a young cluster . calibrating this empirical mass - period - age relation to the onc , ngc 2264 , ngc 2362 , ic348 , ngc 2547 , and ngc 2516",
    ", we find that ngc 6530 is the youngest of all , with a maximum age of 1.65  myr on an age scale where the onc is 2  myr .",
    "the evidence points strongly to ngc 6530 being in a very early stage of rotational evolution in which the stars are currently evolving toward a state that will presumably resemble the onc within the next @xmath241  myr .",
    "thus ngc 6530 becomes an important new touchstone for theoretical models of angular momentum evolution in young , low - mass stars .",
    "an important question that remains to be resolved is the role of circumstellar disks in the rotational evolution of these stars .",
    "the observed correlation between nir excess and slow rotation has been taken in previous studies as evidence for rotational braking via star - disk interaction .",
    "however , it is not clear that theories of star - disk interaction in fact predict this correlation .",
    "additionally , recent detailed modeling of the full spectral energy distributions of young stars with rotation periods in ic348 indicate that , if disks do affect the spin rates of the stars , they must act both to spin down some stars and to spin up others @xcite .",
    "a similarly detailed assessment of the disk torques likely being experienced by the stars in ngc 6530 will be important to determine whether and how disks may yet be acting to shape the mass - period relationship in this very young cluster .",
    "finally , it remains an important challenge to empirically connect the rotational properties of pms stars to those of main - sequence stars , and to theoretically connect the dominant mechanisms thought to govern the evolution of angular momentum in the pms to those on the main sequence .",
    "main sequence angular momentum evolution is principally understood through intrinsic structural changes in the stars that , through stellar winds , lead to distinct period - mass relationships that evolve predictably with time and thus permit reliable age - dating of stars ( gyrochronology ) .",
    "in contrast , in the pms phase the dominant angular momentum evolution mechanisms have generally been thought to be extrinsic to the stars ( e.g. , disk - locking ) .",
    "yet it is now clear that low - mass stars already evince clear period - mass relationships in the pms stage .",
    "evidently , as early as the very young age of ngc 6530 , a period - mass relationship that can be projected forward to the main sequence is already taking form , and this relationship already encodes stellar age .",

    "<S> we observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution , but we do find that stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average . </S>",
    "<S> the stars x - ray luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period , at the saturation level ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find a significant positive correlation between @xmath3 and co - rotation radius , suggesting that the observed x - ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal stripping of the stellar coronae . the period  </S>",
    "<S> mass relationship in ngc 6530 is broadly similar to that of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , but the slope of the relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the onc and other young clusters . we show that the slope of the period  mass relationship for the slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster , and we argue that ngc  6530 may be slightly younger than the onc , making it a particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in young , low - mass stars . </S>"
