    "as new data resolve higher order peaks , attention shifts to the physics at angular scales beyond that of the first maximum .",

    "it is found that the peak index approximates a function of @xmath1 .",
    "although our analysis grounds itself in the familiar concepts of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , the results are not widely recognized . while the physical effects responsible for @xmath0 are understood , the interplay that gives the @xmath1 dependence is not intuitive and holds a number of surprises .",
    "we end the investigation by using the functional form of @xmath0 and current angular spectrum data to obtain parameter constraints resembling those of more sophisticated treatments .    throughout this work",
    ", the ( @xmath3,@xmath2 ) plane serves as the parameter space .",
    "other quantities enter , though the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is relatively independent of them .",
    "to be concrete , we take @xmath13 , consistent with nucleosynthesis @xcite .",

    "the sound horizon at decoupling @xmath11 in comoving coordinates is then @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "@xmath12 and @xmath11 give the angular size of the horizon : @xmath39 values for @xmath40 corresponding to the numerical and analytic results for @xmath12 ( see section [ sec : da ] ) are plotted in figure [ fig : dths ] .",

    "the angle subtended by the sound horizon , and so the position of the first peak , approximates a function of @xmath1 . _",
    "a well known corollary to this general statement is that a peak corresponding to @xmath43 should be insensitive to variations in @xmath3 @xcite .    to check whether this simple analysis agrees with the standard model , we compare the above results to those from cmbfast @xcite .",
    "cmbfast calculates the cmb angular spectrum.,recfast , no reion , scalar only , primordial index 1,adiabatic ) . ] then , @xmath0 from the spectrum multiplies @xmath40 from figure [ fig : dths ] to give the constant of proportionality @xmath44 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : cmbfast ] , the numerically derived @xmath45 increases from 110 ( @xmath46 ) to 125 ( @xmath47 ) and has weak if any dependence on curvature .",
    "the near constant graphs of @xmath45 suggests a well - defined agreement between the peak indices from cmbfast and those derived from this work s numerical and analytic calculations ( see middle frame of figure [ fig : cmbfast ] ) .",
    "to gain intuition about @xmath40 , consider the closed comoving universe ( eq . [ [ eqn : frw ] ] ) illustrated in figure [ fig : dths ] , where time and azimuthal angular coordinates have been supressed to produce the familiar two - sphere geometry . in this picture , cmb photons follow great circles , and , assuming a small angle , @xmath40 derives from inspection : @xmath48 which is exactly equation ( [ eqn : dths ] ) .    to better understand the parameter dependence of @xmath11 ,",
    "take the sound speed @xmath34 ( eq . [ [ eqn : snd_spd ] ] ) to be constant at @xmath49 .",
    "( with @xmath13 and radiation density derived from the cobe firas measurement , the sound speed decreases at a near constant rate ( @xmath50 ) from @xmath51 at a=0 to four - fifths that value at decoupling @xcite . )",
    "the sound horizon is then @xmath52 where the final equality follows from the friedmann equation ( [ eqn : friedmann ] ) with @xmath53 .    to obtain a simple formula for @xmath0 ,",
    "expand @xmath12 to first order in @xmath54 : @xmath55 the expansion applies to models with a low curvature - to - matter ratio . coincidentally ,",
    "such models are favored by experiment , so that the resulting formula for @xmath0 is useful . given equations ( [ eqn : rsapprox ] ) and ( [ eqn : daapprox ] ) and a value of @xmath45 from figure [ fig : cmbfast ] , @xmath56 this near - flat approximation is plotted in figure [ fig : cmbfast ] where @xmath57 . for flat models , the distance to last scatter ( eq . [ [ eqn : daapprox ] ] ) scales as @xmath58 .",
    "one may intuit that self - gravitation leads to smaller cosmological separations .",
    "this same `` gravitational '' effect decreases the distance between the big bang and last scatter , and therefore @xmath11 ( eq . [ [ eqn : rsapprox ] ] ) also scales with an overall factor of @xmath58 . in equation ( [ eqn : roughell ] )",
    ", the @xmath58 dependence of @xmath12 cancels that of @xmath11 .",
    "this cancellation helps explain the @xmath3-@xmath9 degeneracy of flat cosmogonies .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 term in equation ( [ eqn : roughell ] ) is proportional to the curvature times the area between light rays in a two - dimensional representation of an @xmath59 universe ( e.g. figure [ fig : dths ] ) .",
    "this suggests that one may think of ( @xmath3,@xmath2 ) dependence of @xmath0 in near - flat spacetimes as resulting from light curving like the geodesics of a two - dimensional space of constant curvature .",
    "finally , the effect of radiation on early universe dynamics and , in particular , on @xmath11 is made explicit by the appearance of @xmath8 in equation ( [ eqn : rsapprox ] ) .",
    "radiation - dominated cosmological growth per expansion scale ( @xmath60 ) is less than that of matter - dominated dynamics . in low @xmath3 universes",
    ", radiation brings last scattering even closer to the big bang and so shortens @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the effect of radiation in the early universe is to spoil the pure @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 as manifest by the curved contours in the plot of equation ( [ eqn : roughell ] ) in figure [ fig : cmbfast ] .",
    "the straightness of the @xmath0 contours is restored in the numerical result shown in figure [ fig : dths ] .",
    "this suggests that explicit inclusion of @xmath9 in the computation of @xmath12 balances the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "the peak index has long been recognized as an indicator of geometry .",
    "it is hoped that the present analysis sheds new light on @xmath0 .",
    "the peak index does not determine the magnitude of curvature , but rather the ratio of curvature to matter .",
    "a measurement of the peak s angular scale gives the precise geometry only if @xmath59 , otherwise @xmath0 is a function of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , in deriving the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 , unexpected cosmological cancellings were discovered .",
    "particularly useful is the balance of overall matter dependencies in @xmath11 and @xmath12 which helps account for the @xmath3-@xmath9 degeneracy in flat models . at the same time , however , it is remarkable that the admittedly simple arguments of this work yield such a decisive cosmological indicator . within the next few years",
    ", nasa s map satellite data should give @xmath0 to cosmic - variance levels .",
    "this measurement will burn a sharp line of possible worlds across the ( @xmath42 ) plane .",
