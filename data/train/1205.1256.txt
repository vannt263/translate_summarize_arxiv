    "this article concerns relationalism .",
    "this word is used very differently by barbour ( and various collaborators ) and i @xcite on the one hand , and by crane @xcite and rovelli @xcite ( with subsequent use in loop quantum gravity ( ` lqg ' ) @xcite ) on the other hand .",
    "this article is mostly about the former ( a successor to / considerable extension of @xcite ) , though it does contrast , and to some extent compose , this with the latter .",
    "moreover , the position developed here most ly lies _ between _ barbour s @xcite and rovelli s @xcite extremes regarding the fine detail of the machian notion of time as being abstracted from change .",
    "as regards other recent reviews , pooley s @xcite is a 3-way comparison of which three barbour s alone features in this review ( i go for the approaches that enter quantum gravity programs , whereas pooley goes for the past 2 decades philosophizing ) .",
    "barbour s article @xcite and gryb s thesis @xcite largely only cover barbour s approach .",
    "in sec 2 , i sketch the history of the absolute versus relational motion debate , which remains an active source of contention between a number of different approaches to the unsolved problem of quantum gravity ( ` qg ' ) today .",
    "in fact , i consider qg to stand for _ quantum gestalt _ , a term that i coin in recognition of gr being not only a relativistic theory of gravitation but also , following einstein , a freeing of physics from absolute / background structure ; the expression ` quantum gravity ' fails to capture the latter .",
    "thus i am taking ` quantum gestalt ' to be shorthand for quantum theory of the relativistic gravity  background independence gestalt .",
    "certainly most lqg practitioners agree that what they are studying is also intended as a quantum theory of background independence ; this is also to be understood of some approaches to m - theory ( but not of perturbative string theory ) .",
    "[ as to other names , ` quantum gr ' will not do in this role since it implies the specific einstein field equations , whereas quantum gestalt remains open - minded as to which relativistic theory of gravitation is involved ; this distinction parallels that between ` quantum gr ' and ` quantum gravity ' .",
    "quantum gestalt is also in contradistinction with ` background independent quantum gravity ' since the latter carries connotations of the background independent and gravitational parts being _ split _ , whereas in the former they are held to be _",
    "joint_. finally , much as one can model quantum gravity without background independence ( at least for some purposes ) , one can likewise model quantum background independence without relativistic gravitation ; from the quantum gestalt perspective , these two ventures are complements , suggesting that one may learn considerably from the latter as well as from the former .",
    "relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) @xcite , once quantized @xcite , is such a theory of quantum background independence without relativistic gravitation . ]",
    "sec 2 also suggests some simple informal interpretations that might be taken to underlay some of the leibniz- and mach - type ideas that are themselves presented in subsequent sections .    in sec 3 ,",
    "i consider configuration space @xmath1 and barbour s ascribing primality to it in his relational program @xcite . whilst leibniz @xcite argued for time not to be primary , mach @xcite argued for time to be an emergent concept , more specifically that ` time is to be abstracted from change ' .",
    "this program s subsequent build - up ( see also @xcite ) of actions that are temporally relational ( leibnizian ) and configurationally relational with respect to some group @xmath2 of transformations that are held to be unphysical , is reviewed and generalized in secs 4 to 8 .",
    "this includes using jacobi ",
    "synge @xcite type actions , dispensing with velocity as a primary notion and recasting the canonical definition of momenta accordingly , as well as using barbour and bertotti s @xcite indirect implementation of configurational relationalism and the jacobi  barbour ",
    "bertotti realization of a machian emergent time .",
    "sec 8 discusses the alternative direct implementation @xcite of configurational relationalism that is occasionally available .",
    "sec 9 provides a number of examples , including 1- and 2-@xmath3 rpm s for which the direct implementation is available @xcite .",
    "it also covers how , whilst gr is usually formulated in a spacetime way that does not directly implement mach s ideas as understood in the relational program , can nevertheless be cast in a manifestly relational form @xcite that is quite akin to geometrodynamics , and even more akin to the baierlein  sharp ",
    "wheeler @xcite and christodoulou chronos principle @xcite formalisms .",
    "moreover , whilst this lmb ( leibniz  mach ",
    "barbour ) program s literature usually uses this more traditional dynamical formulation of gr , i lay out how the ashtekar variables approach is also lmb - relational .",
    "i also provide some comments on relationalism versus supersymmetry ( see @xcite for more ) , string theory and m - theory . as such",
    ", i make contact between lmb relationalism and much of modern theoretical physics .",
    "given these examples , i am in a position to comment further on compatibility restrictions between the @xmath1 s and the @xmath2 s in sec 10 .",
    "i then consider four expansions of barbour s ` @xmath1 is primary ' postulate : to ( perhaps weakened ) phase space in sec 11 , to categorization in sec 12 , to propositioning in sec 13 and to ` perspectivalism ' in sec 14 .",
    "categorizing means considering not only object spaces but also the corresponding morphisms and then functors between such pairs .",
    "perspecting means considering the set of subsystem perspectives ; this is an arena in which the lmb and rc approaches make contact . by propositioning , i mean considering the set of propositions about a physical ( sub)system ; this makes contact with ideas of isham , doering and butterfield @xcite concerning applying topos theory to quantum theory ) .",
    "perspecting makes substantial contact with the other main line of work termed ` relational ' in the quantum gravity literature , i.e. rovelli and crane s works . in sec 15",
    "i consider a substantial generalization of barbour s ` best matching ' indirect implementation of configurational relationalism , that also happens to generalize the mathematically well - known notion of group - averaging .",
    "i next consider the corresponding situation at the quantum level in secs 16 to 21 .",
    "this is entwined with a number of facets of the notorious problem of time and of relevance as regards selection of strategies to attempt to resolve this .",
    "sec 16 covers temporal and configurational relationalism within a quantum scheme along the lines of isham 1984 @xcite .",
    "i include analysis of the problem of time facets and strategies in accord to the extent to which their attitude to time is leibniz  mach .",
    "i illustrate this with examples in sec 17 .",
    "i then consider @xmath1 primality at the quantum level in sec 18 , provide arguments against considering quantization in general as a functor in sec 19 , and discuss qm perspectivalism in sec 20 with rovelli and crane inputs and qm propositioning in sec 21 with contact with isham and doering s work .",
    "my conclusion ( sec 22 ) covers the presently - known principal applications of the current article .",
    "1 ) pointers relating machian time interpretations to the formulations of timeless approaches @xcite , 2 ) other problem of time applications , 3 ) the issue of whether scale should be among the concepts discarded by relationalism ( which argument is tied to the semiclassical approach to quantum cosmology ) .",
    "4 ) this article comments on the foundations of , and relational notions applicable in , ashtekar variables / lqg .",
    "5 ) it also suggests contention between relationalism and supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "6 ) finally , i outline various possibilities for unifying isham  doering propositioning with each of rovelli  crane perspecting and records theory .",
    "this debate has been around since the inception of newtonian mechanics . in outline , newton s @xcite traditional formulation of mechanics defined ` true ' motion to be relative to an absolute space that is all - pervasive , infinite , invisible and",
    "can not be acted upon .",
    "newton also considered motion to occur _ in _ time .",
    "his notion of time was additionally an absolute one .",
    "i.e. , external , continuous , and uniformly flowing as ` needed to transform kinematic geometry into physical dynamics ' @xcite .",
    "( in fact , much of this conception of time was not new to newton , c.f .",
    "barrow @xcite , gassendi @xcite and even ptolemy @xcite . )",
    "the virtue of newton s scheme is working well in practise , nature immediately vindicating its practical consequences in detail .",
    "however , newton s formulation of mechanics has been argued to be bankrupt from a philosophical perspective .",
    "absolute space does not comply with leibniz s famous * identity of indiscernibles * @xcite , by which e.g. our universe and a copy in which all material objects are collectively displaced by a fixed distance surely share all observable properties and thus are one and the same . also , leibniz already considered time not to be a separate external entity with respect to which things change .",
    "bishop berkeley @xcite and mach @xcite ( see also e.g. @xcite for further discussion ) added to these arguments , e.g. mach holding absolute space to be a non - entity on account of its not being actable upon .",
    "the alternative is for mechanics to be * relational * : spatial properties are to be entirely about the relations between material objects , and ` time to be abstracted from change ' ( mach s notion ) .",
    "historically , there was a lack in alternative theories with such features , though the comparatively recent rpm s of barbour  bertotti ( 1982 ) and barbour ( 2003 ) that are the subject of this article do now serve as such .",
    "furthermore , leibniz , bishop berkeley and mach s arguments are philosophically compelling enough that they ought to apply to not just mechanics but to physics as a whole .",
    "as argued in sec 9 , gr is also relational , and indeed relationalism is one foundation from which gr _ can _ be derived , for all that this was not the historical route to gr . for , while einstein was interested in ` machian issues ' , the way in which he viewed these does not coincide with the barbour - relational view @xcite , nor did einstein s historical route to gr @xcite constitute a _ direct _ implementation of machian ideas",
    "( see sec 9 ) .",
    "see e.g. @xcite as regards arguments for ( and against ) the value of barbour and bertotti s 1982 theory toward the absolute or relative motion debate .",
    "relationalism would appear to have a good case for use in whole - universe situations , both from a philosophical perspective and because gr and at least some further gr - like theories do implement it .",
    "( these are good theories for whole - universe situations on a number of further grounds . )      some intuitive if vague underlying relational principles are as follows .",
    "relationalism 0 ) * relational physics is to be solely about the relations between tangible entities *    this is taken to be the universalization of sec 2.1 s statement of relationalism for mechanics to all physics .",
    "i use ` * tangible entities * ' in place of ` material objects ' to make it clear that this is open to fields and ` force mediators ' as well as ` matter building blocks ' , as befits modern physics .",
    "the key properties of tangible entities are , rather , as follows .",
    "relationalism 1 ) [ mach ] these * act testably and are actable upon*.    relationalism 2 ) [ leibniz ] any such which are * indiscernible are held to be identical*.    note 1 ) that which is not testably acting or actable upon is held to be , rather , a non - entity .",
    "[ this is still held to be a type of entity as regards being able to philosophize about it or mathematically represent it , just not a _ physical _ entity ; absolute space is an obvious archetypal example . ]",
    "this is less vague than saying ` things ' , which could be _ merely _ mathematical in nature .",
    "note 2 ) as regards relationalism 2 ) , in physics , relationalism posits that physical indiscernibility _ must _ trump multiplicity of mathematical representation ; this multiplicity still exists mathematically , but the true mathematics corresponding to the physics in question is the equivalence class spanning that multiplicity .",
    "a range of attitudes to the identity of indiscernibles and alternatives to it are considered by butterfield and caulton @xcite one would then only wish to attribute physical significance to computations of tangible entities which succeed in being independent of the choice of representative of the equivalence class ; the archetype of this is gauge theory .",
    "chapter 2 of @xcite also argues that dimension is partly undefined for a universe consisting of a sufficiently small number of particles .",
    "an important lesson from there is that a set of part - tangible and part - non entities is often altogether more straightforward to represent mathematically .",
    "note 3 ) in this article s main sense of relational , one treats instantaneous configurations and time separately as befits the great conceptual heterogeneity between them .    note 4 )",
    "one largely accepts that the mathematics will be in general be most straightforward for mixtures of part - tangible- and part - non - entities .",
    "note 5 ) i do not take this ssec s principles too seriously ; it is the standard use of configuration space , and relationalism 46 ) and 8) , perhaps supplemented by relationalism 3 ) and 7 ) , that are the actually mathematically - implemented starting point of the lmb approach ( and variants ) . as such , relationalism 02 ) for",
    "now being vague or loose relative to relationalism 3 ) to 8) is not a problem for the work actually done in this article , but only for this present ssec , which represents a tentative under_laying _ rather than a rigorous foundational under_lying_.",
    "as regards the instantaneous configuration entities of a given theory , which i denote by @xmath4 , a key further concept is the    _ configuration space _ @xmath1 , i.e. the space of all the possible instantaneous configurations ( each of the points in configuration space represents one state of the instantaneous configuration , i.e. a set of one value per @xmath4 ) .",
    "example 1 ) particle positions are configurations ; see @xcite for a clear exposition of the configuration space notion for these .",

    "example 4 ) the values at each point of continuous extended objects , whether fields or geometrical objects that have values everywhere in space , which include both the 3-metrics ( or the more reduced 3-geometries ) of gr ( see sec 9.4 ) and objects that have their own separate _ notion of space ( nos ) _ of extent such as strings or membranes .",
    "i denote the general nos by @xmath5 for @xmath6 the dimension of space , and i coordinatize it by @xmath7 .",
    "however , in this article all specific examples of this are for @xmath8 ( field theories ) , in which case i drop the @xmath9 subscripts , or for @xmath10 , in which case @xmath11 is just a point corresponding to the particle position , which point ceases to possess any internal coordinatization .",
    "i denote integration over whatever nos is appropriate by @xmath12 .",
    "i take this to collapse to a multiplicative 1 for particle mechanics and other finite theories .",
    "i denote finite theory cases instantaneous configurations by @xmath13 . for field theory cases ,",
    "i denote the instantaneous configurations by @xmath14 .",
    "thus the typeface object @xmath15 is a portmanteau of the upright space - dependent case for field theories and the slanty case for finite theories .",
    "that is the default notation in this article as regards typeface , straight and slanty symbols .",
    "such portmanteaux serve as a shorthand covering both cases at once to encompass both this article s rpm models and the geometrodynamical formulation of gr that they are closely analogous to .",

    "i use braces for actual brackets .",
    "i then use a special font ( large mathfrak ) for such portmanteaux that come integrated over their corresponding notion of space ( the action @xmath19 is a such ) ; these are therefore pure functionals in terms of what they depend on , but differ in the portmanteau way in terms of what features on the computational side of the equation . ]",
    "configuration space is generally not just a set , being , rather , further equipped with topological space , metric space and geometrical structure .",
    "a broad example of the last of these is finsler metric geometry @xmath20 for @xmath21 a topological manifold and @xmath22 the metric function . to denote ` space of ' .",

    "some of the relational program s examples are in fact infinite - dimensional generalizations of such geometries .",
    "( but i still refer to such by the usual finite - dimensional geometries names , i.e. i elevate those names to be finite and field - theoretic portmanteaux of the usual finite notions ) .",

    "this does not necessarily mean that relationalists discard structures , but rather that they are prepared to consider the outcome of doing so .",
    "some relational ideas are a subset of minimalism , e.g. doubting and discarding absolute space and absolute time .",
    "see also secs 10 and 16 as regards whether scale is to be discarded from physics , secs 2 and 9 as regards relationalists questioning of minkowski s view on spacetime and its subsequent primacy over how gr is conceived of .",
    "[ i.e. arguing that the dynamical tradition favours the primality of space , and that this , despite amounting to supposing less structure , nevertheless turns out to serve as an alternative foundation for gr . ]",

    "note 1 ) in making use of actions , we are working with , and drawing upon , the principles of dynamics .",
    "many of the steps below follow from this as natural consequences of having an action , rather than of relationalism per se .",
    "but the particular actions used embody relationalism , and the some of the subsequent principles of dynamics workings assist in enforcing that .",
    "this valuing and making specific use of the principles of dynamics differs from mach s own thinking ; it is due to barbour and concerns positing that relational actions are the most fundamental starting - point for ( classical ) whole - universe physics .",

    "the compound objects readily include nos derivatives",
    "( whenever the nos is nontrivial ) and contracted objects . from what the reader knows about actions",
    ", one might expect velocities to be required too , and these involve an incipient notion of time , so we need to discuss that next before making progress with the construction of actions .",
    "moreover , the manner of that progress may well be unexpected to the reader .",
    "in particular , actions conventionally involve velocities .",
    "relationalism 5 ) [ leibniz ] a physical theory is * temporally relational * if there is * no meaningful primary notion of time for the system as a whole * ( e.g. the universe ) @xcite .",

    "the action is , in complete generality , to be homogeneous linear in the d(configuration variable ) so as to comply with mpi / mri ; in the homogeneous quadratic case this amounts to taking the square root .",

    "it is still a geodesic principle , just for a more complicated notion of geometry .",
    "in fact , the jacobi - type action more commonly arises in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) not from the desire to be relational but rather from the desire to provide the natural mechanics for a given geometry .",

    ", it turns out that the notion of conjugate momentum itself survives , by there being an equivalent manifestly - relational form for the defining formula , @xmath75 then computing this gives @xmath76 which is manifestly within the span of notion ( [ erina ] ) .",
    "next , one inspects to see if there are any inter - relations among these momenta due to the form of the action : _ primary _ _ constraints _ @xcite .",
    "then variation of the action with respect to the base objects provides some evolution equations and perhaps some _ secondary constraints _ @xcite .",
    "one then finds the evolution equations .",
    "finally , one checks whether even more constraints may arise by the requirement that the evolution equations propagate the constraints ; this is best done at the level of poisson brackets ( or dirac brackets if required by the presence of so - called _ second - class _ constraints ) .",
    "the mri implementation of temporal relationalism leads to constraints via the following general argument of dirac @xcite ( as straightforwardly modified by me to concern differentials rather than velocities , and mpi instead of mri actions ) . since mpi actions are homogeneous of degree 1 in the differentials , the @xmath77 momenta arising from these are homogeneous of degree 0 in the differentials .",
    "hence the momenta are functions of at most @xmath78 independent ratios of differentials .",
    "thus the momenta must have at least 1 relation between them ( which is by definition a primary constraint ) .",
    "moreover , for the above jacobi - type action , there is precisely one such constraint ( per relevant nos point ) .",
    "this is due to    \\a ) the square - root form of the action , by which the momenta are much like direction cosines and ` their squaring to 1 ' property by which they are not all independent . here , instead , these square ( using the @xmath79 matrix ) to @xmath80 .",

    "this is modulo a small glitch at the start of such an investigation , which nevertheless turns out to be entirely surmountable .",
    "namely , that the pure gravity case of the ashtekar variables approach is not castable in temporally relational form at the level of the classical lagrangian . from the point of view in which spacetime is presupposed @xcite , in which one sets about elimination of the lapse to form the temporally relational action , this glitch is due to the following .",
    "the lapse - uneliminated action is purely linear in the lapse .",
    "this is because the well - known ` pure-@xmath205 ' character of ashtekar s canonical action for pure gr , in contrast to the more usual ` @xmath206 ' form of the geometrodynamical action .",
    "thus the variation with respect to the lapse produces an equation independent of the lapse .",
    "thus the lapse can not now be eliminated from its own variational equation .",
    "however , it is clear that addition of matter fields breaks this pure linearity in the lapse , so this unusual accident that blocks the elimination of the lapse from its own variational equation ceases to occur and a temporally relational action can be obtained .",
    "thus that the barbour / lmb - relational literature s looks to be fixated with gr in geometrodynamical form as regards which examples it uses is in fact down to a matter of taste / of each paper s applications , rather than being in any way being indicatory of lmb - relationalism only applying to the older geometrodynamics and not the newer ashtekar variables work that underlies lqg .",
    "it is then surely of foundational importance for ashtekar variables programs for them to be revealed to be relational in this additional well - motivated and historically and philosophically well - founded way in addition to the various other meanings that they have hitherto been pinning on the word ` relational ' in the ashtekar variables / lqg program .",
    "pointing this out is one of the main applications of this article .",
    "configurational relationalism for ashtekar variables formulations has @xmath207 diff(3 ) .",

    "the hamiltonian constraint arises as a primary constraint , and the usual form for a jbb time emerges .",
    "an ashtekar variables formulation of a type of gr shape dynamics has recently appeared @xcite .",
    "compared to theories preceding it , supersymmetry is conceptually strange in how the product of two supersymmetry operations produces a _ spatial _ transformation , and possibly also via how the supersymmetry constraint in supergravity is the square root of the hamiltonian constraint @xcite . as such , there is some chance that the supersymmetry transformation is one of not conceptually sound , or conceptually deeper than , other transformations , and the relational perspective could be one that had more to say about this matter .",
    "thus , _ the relational program might be able to provide its own prediction _ as to whether to expect supersymmetry in nature .",

    "these are comparable from a conceptual perspective ; whether each of these is rich , tractable and has anything to say about quantum gravity is another matter .",
    "the latter is moreover more conservative  the relational quantities come from careful thought about the original problem rather than replacing it with a distinct problem as in string theory .",
    "this gives less new structure leading perhaps to less mathematical richness , but it it would appear to be a safer bet as regards the  _ hypotheses non fingo _ \" tradition .",
    "exporting the configurational relationalism / best matching ideas to other parts of physics could conceivably be of interest even if not accompanied by the further demands of no background spatial structures or of temporal relationalism .",
    "e.g. one could consider what form these ideas take for target space theories of which strings on a given background .",
    "finally , one would expect nonperturbative m - theory to have _ both _ of these features ( relationalism _ and _ extended objects ) .",
    "provided that supersymmetry can be accommodated into ( a suitable generalization of ) relationalism , i conjecture that relational notions along the lines of those in this article are necessary for any truly gr - embracing notion of background independence for m - theory since background - independence amounts to a problem of time , it would then be exceedingly likely for m - theory to have one of those too .",

    "a number of these steps already have individual difficulties .    two reasons for the kinquant functor to be ` bad ' ( or , at least , ambiguous ) are 1 ) preferred subalgebra choice ( and the nontriviality thereof by e.g. groenewold  van hove and 2 ) global considerations .",

    "a different line of objection to quantization itself is that it is only desirable in the incipient parts of conceiving a quantum theory ( so it is tied to an understood classical theory , but qm is more fundamental so one needs to pass to first principles quantum theory which one then has the sometimes fatal hope of recovery of a recognized classical limit ) .",
    "[ for some particular examples , the functor does work out , but the above demonstrates that for suitably general theories there is not at all a standard prescription for quantizing , and formatting this as a functor does not in any way help with that . ]",

    "crane then maintains that the whole universe has no hilbert space ( so his version of what i term persp(@xmath1 ) has @xmath305 in place of my @xmath306 ) , though a hilbert space is to be recovered in a semiclassical limit .",
    "i dissect this as follows due to not agreeing will all parts of it .",

    "that is why i use @xmath306 and not @xmath305 ; this difference also accounts for my replacing ` all ' by ` almost ' .",

    "this can accommodate perspectivalism 1 ) to some extent , but can not meaningfully incorporate perspectivalism 2 ) which explicitly requires non - negligibility of observer material properties .",
    "note 4 ) the crane set - up then involves ` the entire set of subquant s ' , with perspectivalism 2 necessitating yet further structure beyond that , as well as nontrivial modelling of observers as quantum systems [ an idea nobody can really calculate with , which also features in the thinking of page @xcite and of hartle @xcite ; the state of the art here is hartle s information gathering and utilizing system ( igus ) model for observers @xcite .",
    "my preceding ssec makes the possible advance that ` the entire set ' requires physical sub@xmath1 s rather than the greater mathematical generality of sub@xmath1 s , and that it is additionally contingent on a definition of localization in space to be obeyed as a further practical consideration in the selection of a set .",
    "i add that these desirable features would not appear to be conducive to the implementing sets being mathematically simple ; the notion of localization in space in particular would introduce a source of ambiguity into the model : _ how _ local and by what criterion .    the concepts embodied by perspectivalism 3 ) and 4 ) carry over straightforwardly to the quantum level .",

    "i argue then that it is better to hold to an intermediate interpretation : a _ sufficient totality of locally relevant change _ , as judged at the level of which relative forces significantly affect the equations of motion , which i term lmb - a time , is new to this article and is further elaborated upon in @xcite ( see sec 22.1 for an outline ) .",
    "this covers further detail of this approach , and how each of these three approaches leads to distinct attitudes to the theory of time - keeping and to distinct timeless approaches to the problem of time in quantum gestalt .",
    "[ [ application-1 - 3-interpretations - of - machs - time - is - to - be - abstracted - from - change - principle ] ] application 1 ) 3 interpretations of mach s ` time is to be abstracted from change ' principle ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    each of these three has a supporting argument .",
    "rovelli s interpretation applies generically ( regardless of physical regime or material composition of the system in question ) . on the other hand ,",
    "lmb s interpretation , by using the totality of the change , produces an _ incontestable _ time , in that there is no more change elsewhere that can run in suspiciously irregular ways that cause of one to doubt one s timestandard .",
    "however , there is plenty of middle ground between these two positions .",
    "note 1 ) this holds without having to go to the whole - universe extreme , which is impractical , and operationally undesirable  we know little of the motions and constitutions of very distant bodies .",
    "also , since leibniz s day , the notion of ` universe ' has gotten a whole lot more complicated with gr  were this taken seriously , does it refer to the hubble radius or to the actual entirely of the universe including unobservable portions ? n.b . that this leibniz ",
    "gr discrepancy in the nature of the universe becomes a red herring in the below discussion .",
    "note 2 ) this also raises a partial objection to the rovelli scheme , in that whilst rovelli does not state he is looking for ` good clocks ' , those are a fair notion to ask about , and yet clash conceptually with rovelli - type notions that any time , or any clock , will do . on the other hand ,",
    "barbour s approach is very conducive toward asking and conceptually answering this question .          in comparison to amr",
    ", it has the extra element of acknowledging some times are locally more useful to consider than others . even in a generic situation",
    ", one can have a local ranking procedure for candidate times , alongside a refining procedure until acceptable accuracy of predictability is obtained .    in comparison with lmb time ,",
    "the practically - used ephemeris - type method for the solar system is entirely adequate without having to consider the net physical effect ( tidal effect ) of distant massive bodies such as andromeda ( thus also rendering irrelevant our increasing lack of precise knowledge of the masses and positions as one considers more and more distant objects ) .",
    "* lmb - a timekeeping * : is like astronomers ephemeris actually was , or atomic clock timekeeping from the perspective including recalibration by comparison with solar system dynamics .",
    "this more faithful representation of the astronomers actual procedure ( such as ephemeris time or atomic time recalibrated in accord with solar - system physics ) is why i take inquiring in detail into what is meant by ` universe ' in the lmb approach to be a red herring .",
    "relationalism 7 m ) is to be implemented by a * generalized local ephemeris procedure*. i.e. , do not just use a change to abstract a time , but also check whether using this time in the equations of motion for other changes suffices to predict these to one s desired accuracy",
    ". further detail of this approach , and of how each of the above three approaches leads to distinct attitudes to the theory of time - keeping and to distinct timeless approaches to the problem of time in qg with distinct notions of emergent time is the subject of @xcite .    n.b .",
    "that the relationalism 7 versus relationalism 7w clash means that one can not just add the rc postulates to the lmb ones ; relationalism 7 m then represents a compromise between these [ and is also the most accurate encapsulation of astronomical ( based ) timestandards ] .",
    "application 2 ) is the wider relational assessment of the problem of time s facets and strategies .",
    "as regards frozen formalism problem resolving strategies , leibniz - time , mach - time and tangibility arguments hold against most tempus ante quantum strategies ( internal time , matter time ... ) . on the other hand , emergent jbb time and the approximately equivalent emergent semiclassical time comply with these criteria .",
    "timeless and histories theory approaches generally do so too .",
    "many other problem of time facets have also been exposited as relational in this article . in particular , i have argued that the thin sandwich problem facet is generalized by , and relationally interpreted as , the best matching problem , with other lmb - relational ties being established to the foliation dependence problem , functional evolution problem , problem of beables and spacetime reconstruction problem .",
    "on the other hand , the global and multiple choice problems of time have been found to have at least some ties to rovelli s approach to relationalism ( which is also an alternative stance on the problem of beables and the most sympathetic of the relational positions considered in this article as regards internal time and matter time approaches ) .",
    "application 1 ) s finer distinctions between the lmb , lmb - a , and amr attitudes to mach s time principle serve as further distinction between various timeless approaches and semiclassical - histories - timeless approach combinations , though this is largely left to a subsequent article @xcite .",
    "application 6 ) below also concerns a way of enhancing timeless records theory / composites of at least histories theory and records theory .",
    "finally , this article s more minimalist option of not considering ( all ) canonical transformations at least partly selects against internal time , histories brackets , ashtekar variables and linking theory based approaches .",
    "application 3 ) concerns the status of scale in physical theories .",
    "barbour argues against it , in good part due to its heterogeneity as regards all the other degrees of freedom ( the shapes ) .",
    "however , i argue that this heterogeneity can be used to obtain an approximate timestandard based on the scale or some closely - related variable . whilst this in itself does not comply with",
    "my or barbour s interpretation of the mach time principle , allowing the shape degrees of freedom to contribute perturbatively to the more accurate form of resulting timestandard does comply thus .",
    "moreover , this looks to be in particular an accurate rendition of classical and quantum cosmology ( due to the good fortune of anisotropies and inhomogeneities being much smaller than scale effects in that setting ) .    application 4 ) concerns further foundations for ashtekar variables / lqg .",
    "ashtekar variables / lqg are often stated to be relational ; more presicsely , that means rovelli - relational . in the present article , however , i laid out how ashtekar variables are also lmb(-a ) relational .",
    "this is of foundational importance in widening the use of ` relational ' to describe , motivate , structure and further develop the ashtekar variables / lqg program .",
    "i pointed out how rpm s and geometrodynamics form a natural sequence of theories of geometrical configurations , whilst regarding the astekar bein variables as a momentum is then somewhat incongruous . on the other hand , electromagnetism , yang",
    "mills theory and ashtekar variables form a _ rival _ natural sequence .",
    "i also pointed out that whilst lqg is a relational approach in all of this article s senses , it does not presently bear a relational name , ( unlike geometrodynamics or shape dynamics , which are named for their configurationally relational contents ) .",
    "i suggested knot quantum gestalt , quantum nododynamics or quantum spin - knot dynamics ( knots being configurationally relational whilst loops include a diff(3 ) s worth of physical redundancy ) .",
    "i emphasize that by the comments i provide in theis article on ashtekar variables / lqg , supersymmetry , string theory and m - theory , i demonstrate contact between lmb relationalism and much of modern theoretical physics .",
    "application 6 ) concerns bringing together i d and timeless approaches ( some of which also involve elements of rc relationalism ) .",
    "all of these areas of study principally concern subsystems . in the case of i d , this is via at least the great majority of qm propositions that can be asked are about subsystems .",
    "i d has the broadest mathematization ( topos theory ) , whilst crane uses categories .",
    "records theory does not conventionally make use of these structures , and yet i d s development supports histories theory ( which contains , and shared many similarities with , records theory ) and sheaves @xcite as a means of locally attaching information may well provide an insightful new formulation for records theory .",
    "there is however a chasm to bridge . in records",
    "theory , records are local in a _ metric space _ sense , whilst topoi and sheaves have a structurally weaker _ topological space _ notion of locality .",
    "thus one would need to extend / specialize ( provide an extra layer of structure ) to i d s work or consider the extent to which one can conceptualize with records using solely a topological notion of locality .",
