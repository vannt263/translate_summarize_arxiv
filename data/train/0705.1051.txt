    "the field of neutrino oscillations has been rapidly developing from the observation of anomalies in cosmic rays  @xcite and solar  @xcite neutrino data to the cross checks of these anomalies  @xcite and most recently to terrestrial confirmations of neutrino oscillation hypothesis ( kamland , k2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite ) .",
    "the next steps in this field would be the precision measurements of observed mass splitting and mixing angles and detailed experimental study of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "new , extremely intense neutrino beamlines are in operation or being planed",
    ". the data from these experiments will greatly increase statistics .",
    "in this situation , statistical uncertainties should be negligible compared to systematic uncertainties ( ultimate precisions ) .",
    "an important source of systematic uncertainties is related to nuclear effects in neutrino interactions . since",
    "nuclear targets are used as neutrino detectors , a reliable interpretation of neutrino data requires a detailed knowledge of energy and nuclear dependence of neutrino - nucleus ( @xmath0 ) cross sections .",
    "apparently the uncertainties in neutrino cross sections and nuclear effects produce systematic uncertainties in the extraction of mixing parameters .",
    "neutrino beams of high intensity cover the energy range from a few hundred mev to several gev . in this energy regime ,",
    "the dominant contribution to neutrino - nucleus cross section comes from quasi - elastic ( qe ) reactions and resonance production processes .",
    "unfortunately , the cross section data in the relevant energy range are rather scarce and were taken on targets that are not used in neutrino oscillation experiments ( i.e. , water , iron , lead or plastic ) .    a variety of monte carlo codes  @xcite developed to simulate neutrino detector response are based on a simple picture , referred to as relativistic fermi gas model , in which the nucleus is described as a system of quasi - free nucleons .",
    "comparison with high - precision electron scattering data has shown that the accuracy of predictions of this model ( inclusive cross sections ) depends significantly on momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "for inclusive nuclear scattering at sufficiently high momentum transfer ( @xmath1 mev / c ) the rfgm describes general behavior of cross sections .",
    "however , the accuracy of a fermi gas model becomes poor as momentum transfer decreases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , this model does not account for the nuclear shell structure , and for this reason it fails when applied to exclusive cross sections .",
    "there are other important effects beyond the rfgm : the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the outgoing nucleon and residual nucleus and the presence of strong short - range nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) correlations , leading to the appearance of high - momentum and high - energy components in the nucleon energy - momentum distribution in the target . in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite within a plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) the nucleon - nucleon correlations were included using description of nuclear dynamics , based on nuclear many - body theory .",
    "it was shown that the fermi gas model overestimates the total @xmath0 cross section by as much as 20% at incoming neutrino energies of about 1  gev .",
    "neutral current and/or charged current ( cc ) neutrino - nucleus cross sections were studied within the relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) in refs .",
    "@xcite using a relativistic shell model approach .",
    "the implementation of the final - state interaction of the ejected nucleon has been done differently .",
    "a description of the fsi mechanisms through the inclusion of relativistic optical potential is presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite important fsi effects arise from the use of relativistic optical potential within a relativistic green s function approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the final state interaction was included with and without the imaginary part of the optical potential ( for inclusive cross section ) .",
    "a reduction of the total cross section of at least 14% was found at neutrino energies of 1  gev . the relativistic optical potential and relativistic multiple - scattering glauber approximation were applied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the treatment of the fsi effects .",
    "apart from relativistic and the fsi effects . apart from relativistic and fsi effects , other effects may be important in neutrino - nucleus reactions .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite include long - range nuclear correlations ( random - phase approximation ) and fsi and coulomb corrections in the calculation of @xmath3 inclusive cross sections near threshold energy .    in this paper , we compute the single - nucleon knockout contribution to the exclusive , inclusive , and total cross sections of the charged - current qe ( anti)neutrino scattering from @xmath4o using different approximations ( pwia and rdwia ) and the fermi gas model .",
    "we employ the lea code  @xcite developed for the calculation of contribution from 1@xmath5- and 1@xmath6-state nucleons to cross sections in rdwia .",
    "the lea program , initially designed for computing of exclusive proton - nucleus and electron - nucleus scattering , was successfully tested against @xmath7 data  @xcite , and we adopt this code for neutrino reactions . in the pwia ,",
    "the nuclear differential cross section are described in terms of a nuclear spectral function  @xcite , which includes contributions from nuclear shells as well as from the @xmath2 correlations . in our approach ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath2 correlations in the oxygen ground state is evaluated in the pwia using model nucleon high - momentum component  @xcite .",
    "we propose a way to estimate the fsi effect on the inclusive cross sections in the presence of short - range @xmath2 correlations in the ground state .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we compute the rdwia cc qe neutrino cross sections .",
    "second , we test the rfgm against electron scattering data .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following .",
    "in sec.ii we present the formalism for the description of the charged - current lepton - nucleus scattering process .",
    "the rdwia model is briefly introduced in sec.iii .",
    "results of the numerical calculations are presented in sec.iv .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec.v . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the general lorentz structure of the hadronic tensor and give expressions for the cross sections of neutrino exclusive scattering used in our analysis .",
    "we consider electron and neutrino charged - current qe exclusive , @xmath8 and inclusive , @xmath9 scattering off nuclei in a one - photon ( w - boson ) exchange approximation . here",

    "note that the missing momentum is @xmath45 .",
    "the lepton tensor can be written as the sum of the symmetric @xmath46 and antisymmetric @xmath47 tensors    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is @xmath50 for positive lepton helicity and @xmath51 for negative lepton helicity , and @xmath52 is the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath53 .",

    "in the inclusive reactions ( [ qe : incl ] ) only the outgoing lepton is detected , and the differential cross sections can be written as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is inclusive hadronic tensor .",
    "a general covariant form of the hadronic tensors and the results of their contractions with the lepton tensors are given in appendix  [ a ] for exclusive lepton scattering ( [ qe : excl ] ) .",

    "apparently , the @xmath2 correlation effect reduces the total cross section . the difference between the results obtained with and without the high - momentum component contribution decreases with neutrino energy from about 20% for @xmath220 mev down to @xmath221% for @xmath213 mev",
    "moreover , in this case the agreement with the result of ref.@xcite is good , and the discrepancy is less then @xmath222% for @xmath223 mev .",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino total cross sections calculated up to neutrino energy 2.5 gev are shown in fig . 11 together with data of refs.@xcite .",
    "also shown are the results obtained in the rfgm and pwia as well as the contribution of the exclusive channels to the total cross sections .",
    "the cross sections are scaled with the neutron / proton number in the target . the ratio between the neutrino cross sections calculated in the rfgm and rdwia rop decreases with neutrino energy from about 1.5 for @xmath212 mev to @xmath224 for @xmath225 gev and down to @xmath226 for @xmath227 gev . for the antineutrino cross sections ,",
    "this ratio is about 2.7 for @xmath212 mev , 1.3 for @xmath225 gev , and 1.1 for @xmath227 gev .",
    "it follows from the comparison of the pwia and rdwia results that the fsi effects reduce the total cross section . for the neutrino interactions , this reduction is about 16% for @xmath212 mev and decreases slowly to 10% for @xmath227 gev .",
    "the reduction of the antineutrino cross section is about 38% for @xmath212 mev and @xmath228% for @xmath227 gev .",
    "we , therefore , observe the weakening of fsi effect in total cross sections with the increase of energy transfer , in accordance with the calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "the contribution of the exclusive channels is about 60% .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "11 show significant nuclear - model dependence for energy less than 1 gev .",
    "in this paper , we study electron and cc quasi - elastic ( anti)neutrino scattering on the oxygen target in different approximations ( pwia , rdwia , rfgm ) placing particular emphasis on the nuclear - model dependence of the results . in rdwia , the lea program , adapted to neutrino interactions , was used to calculate the differential and reduced exclusive cross sections .",
    "this approach was earlier applied to electron - nucleus scattering and successfully tested against data .",
    "we found that the reduced cross sections for ( anti)neutrino scattering are similar to those of electron scattering , and the latter are in a good agreement with electron data . in calculating the inclusive and total cross sections ,",
    "the imaginary part of relativistic optical potential was neglected and the effect of @xmath2 correlations in the target ground state was taken into account .",
    "this approach was tested against electron - oxygen inclusive scattering data ; there was overall agreement with the data , with the differences between calculated and measured cross sections in the peak region less than 10% .",
    "for neutrino interactions the fsi effect reduces the total cross section by about 30% for @xmath200=200 mev compared to pwia and decreases with neutrino energy down to 10% at 1 gev .",
    "the effect of @xmath2 correlations reduces the total cross section by about 15% at @xmath200=200 mev and also decreases with neutrino energy down to about 8% at 1 gev .",
    "we tested the rfgm against electron - oxygen scattering data and found that this model does not reproduce the exclusive cross section data .",
    "the rfgm also leads to an overestimated value of the inclusive @xmath4o@xmath202 cross section at low momentum transfer .",
    "the discrepancy is about 20% and decreases as momentum transfer increases .",
    "the values of the ( anti)neutrino cross sections calculated in this model are also higher than the corresponding values in the rdwia approach .",
    "we conclude that the data favor the rdwia results .",
    "this indicates that the use of rdwia in monte carlo simulations of neutrino detector response would allow one to reduce the systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the authors greatly acknowledge communications with j. j. kelly whose lea code for nucleon knockout by electron scattering was adapted in this work for neutrino interactions .",
    "this work was partially supported by russian foundation for basic research , project nos .",

    "a general structure of the hadronic tensor can be derived from the requirements of lorentz invariance , parity , and time reversal symmetries . for unpolarized nucleon and a nucleus in the final state",
    ", this tensor must be constructed from three linearly independed four - vectors @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 , the scalars that can be constructed from them , the second - rank metric tensor @xmath232 , and completely antisymmetric tensor @xmath233 .",
    "generally , because of the final state interaction effects , the scattered flux at infinity involves complicated asymptotic configurations , and the time reversal symmetry does not constraint the form of the nuclear tensor for the exclusive reactions  @xcite .      for electron scattering ,",
    "the electromagnetic current conservation requires @xmath234 .",
    "taking into account the parity conservation , the nuclear tensor can then be written as a sum of symmetric , @xmath235 , and antisymmetric , @xmath236 , parts @xcite          in target rest frame , the coordinate system is chosen such that the _ z _ axis is parallel to the momentum transfer @xmath239 and the _ y _ axis is parallel to @xmath240 , and the components of the four - vectors are @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , where @xmath245 , @xmath246 are lepton scattering angles and @xmath70 , @xmath175 are the outgoing nucleon angles .                        note that because of hermicity of @xmath251 , each term of @xmath252 must be real , while each term of @xmath253 must be imaginary , and @xmath254 is real . the result of contraction of the lepton and nuclear tensors can be written as        @xmath256 , \\\\",

    ", the time reversal symmetry of operators and states provides an additional constraint on the lorenz form of the antisymmetric part of nuclear tensor ( a6c ) , in particular , the structures like @xmath258 ( with @xmath259 and @xmath260 four - momenta ) vanish .",
    "then we have            note that the response functions @xmath264 and @xmath265 are related to @xmath266 terms which vanish in the plane - wave limit .",
    "it follows from the expressions ( a7 ) and ( a11 ) that the cross sections asymmetry , which is measured at azimuthal angles @xmath267 and @xmath268 , vanishes in the absence of the fsi .",
