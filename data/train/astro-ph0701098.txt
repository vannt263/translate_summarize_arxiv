    "is a novel transient radio source @xcite , whose notable properties have included `` bursts '' with approximately 1  jy peak flux density lasting approximately 10  min .",
    "each and occurring at apparently regular 77  min.intervals .",
    "we first identified from archival  330  mhz ( 90  cm ) observations taken with the very large array ( vla ) on  2002 september  30 .",
    "we then detected a single burst from the source with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) in archival observations from  2003 september  28 at the same frequency .",
    "is located about  1.25  south of the galactic center just outside ( in angular distance ) the shell - type supernova remnant @xcite . the environment of the source is discussed further in @xcite .",
    "the source  is notable because it is one of a small number of _ radio - selected _ transients .",
    "moreover , with only a few exceptions @xcite such as electron cyclotron masers from flare stars and the planets , plasma emission from solar radio flares , pulsar radio emission , and molecular - line masers , most radio transients are incoherent synchrotron emitters . for an incoherent synchrotron emitter ,",
    "the energy density within the source is limited to an effective brightness temperature of roughly @xmath3  k by the inverse compton catastrophe @xcite .",
    "the properties of  suggest strongly that its brightness temperature exceeds @xmath3  k by a large factor and that it is a member of a new class of coherent emitters @xcite .",
    "the two previous detections of  were based on vla and gmrt 330  mhz observations from two different epochs , but from which similar source properties were observed .",
    "this _ letter _",
    "reports on a third 330  mhz archival observation of , made with the gmrt in 2004 , in which a single , much fainter and shorter burst is detected in contrast to the burst properties observed in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "in addition , the burst is found to have a very steep spectrum , as expected for a coherent emitter , providing another important clue to understanding the nature of this enigmatic source .",
    "possible models for  include nearby objects such as a flaring brown dwarf , flare star , or extra - solar planet , although , as discussed in @xcite , the properties of the source do not easily fit these classes .",
    "alternative models proposed for  thus far are a nulling pulsar ( @xcite ) , a double pulsar ( @xcite ) , a transient white dwarf pulsar ( @xcite ) , and a precessing radio pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "as noted in the latter paper , the double pulsar model predicts a @xmath03-yr bursting activity period which is not supported by the redetections in 2003 and 2004 .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite we presented tentative evidence suggesting that the 2003 burst was an isolated one , and not one of several bursts emitted at 77 min .",
    "intervals , as observed in 2002 .",
    "this evidence could be problematic for some or all of these models .",
    "for example , the proposed double pulsar would link the radio emission to a 77 min .",
    "orbital period . in this model ,",
    "coherent radio emission is triggered by the shock formed through the interaction of the wind of the more enigmatic pulsar with the magnetosphere of the companion pulsar .",
    "on the other hand , in analogy to the psr b1259 - 63 system which consists of a pulsar and be star companion , it is also possible that the magnetosphere of the companion is not constant , and therefore that the radio bursts are not always triggered every orbit . indeed ,",
    "the much fainter detection from  reported in this _ letter _ could be evidence of variable conditions in the environment around a companion star .    similarly , the precessing radio pulsar and transient white dwarf pulsar models would also require one or more types of nulling effects to explain the occurrence of isolated bursts in the short term , as well as the low duty cycle in the long term .",
    "a few radio pulsars are known to have a very large nulling fraction .",
    "psr b1931 + 24 remains in an off state for @xmath090% of the time , and it emits bursts quasi - periodically at @xmath040 per day @xcite . such a high nulling fraction may be consistent with the measured duty cycle estimated for .",
    "the new , serendipitous detection reported in this paper is derived from 330 mhz gmrt galactic center observations obtained by two of us ( s. roy and s. bhatnagar ) as part of an unrelated project and not included in @xcite .",
    "one of the observations , from 2004 march 20 - 21 , is pointed 0.5  from  and consists of eleven 10 min .",
    "scans spread over six hours .",
    "the observations were carried out using the default observing mode with a bandwidth of 16 mhz in each of the two available sidebands .",
    "the sources b1822 - 096 and b1714 - 25 were used as secondary calibrators .",
    "the gmrt does not measure the system temperature ( @xmath4 ) , and the increase in @xmath4 from the calibrator field to the target source affects the source visibility amplitudes in the default observing mode ( i.e. , the automatic level control [ alc ] in the system is turned on ) .",
    "we employed the following method to correct for the @xmath4 variation .",
    "as the system gain does not change with the alc off , we observed 3c48 and b1822 - 096 once with the alc off and determined the flux density of b1822 - 096 to be 10.8 jy using the known flux density of 3c48 from @xcite . also with the alc off , we determined the ratio of the total power on the target source to that of b1822 - 096 to be 1.8 .",
    "since this ratio was quite similar ( within 10% ) for almost all the antennas , rather than correcting the antenna - based gains , we multiplied the final map of the source intensity distribution by this value .",
    "we estimate the overall calibration uncertainty to be within @xmath515% .",
    "the initial images were improved by phase and later amplitude and phase self - calibration .",
    "to produce the final image , separately self - calibrated data from both the sidebands were combined to improve the uv - coverage .",
    "we detect a @xmath010@xmath6 burst from  in the middle of the first scan beginning at approximately 21:31:00 ( iat ) on march 20 and lasting for approximately 2 min .",
    "the source is unresolved and has a flux density of 57.9@xmath56.6 mjy . as a check on the calibration",
    ", we find the flux densities of several bright sources in the field - of - view to be consistent with those obtained in the 330 mhz vla survey of the galactic center by @xcite .    over the past several years",
    ", we have conducted a 330 mhz search for radio transients in the galactic center @xcite using archival observations made between 1989 and the present , and monitoring observations beginning in 2002 .",
    "@xcite summarize the vla and gmrt observations and data reduction through 2005 .",
    "most of these observations are pointed towards sgr a * where the large primary beam at 330 mhz ( 2.2and 1.4 ) and high stellar density subtended optimize the likelihood of detecting a transient , including .",
    "our 2006 and 2007 monitoring program includes observations at 330 mhz ( vla ) and simultaneous observations at 235 and 610 mhz ( gmrt ) ; these will be described in a subsequent paper .",
    "the flux density of the detected 2004 burst is much fainter than the @xmath01  jy peak flux density measured for the five bursts detected in 2002 @xcite and for the one burst detected in 2003 @xcite . due to the relatively short and infrequent scans in the 2004 observations , we detect only a single burst , as in the 2003 epoch .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that additional bursts were emitted at the same 77 min .",
    "interval observed in 2002 .",
    "we note , however , that nondetections in additional scans made at multiples of 77 min . after the detected 2003 burst , but in which  is located well beyond the half power point of the primary beam , suggest that the 2003 detected burst is actually an isolated one @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve04 ] shows the light curves for all seven bursts detected to date . while only the @xmath02  min .",
    "decay portion of the 2003 burst was detected due to its coincidence with the beginning of a scan , the 2004 burst is sampled completely within one scan .",
    "it is detected for only @xmath02  min .",
    "compared with the @xmath010  min .",
    "duration observed for the bursts in 2002 .",
    "is unresolved in all three epochs .",
    "the resolution for the 2004 epoch is approximately 20  @xmath1 10 , comparable to the 2003 epoch , and approximately a factor of  2 better than in the 2002 epoch .",
    "a gaussian fit to the 2004 detection yields a position of ( j2000 ) right ascension @xmath7 @xmath8 509 ( @xmath9 ) , declination @xmath10 09  56.4  ( @xmath11 ) , which is consistent with the 2003 and 2002 positions and is approximately 2.5@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 more accurate , respectively .",
    "the source position and uncertainty cited above include a correction for ionospheric refraction which is prevalent in low frequency observations and discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "separate images were made for the upper ( 333 mhz ) and lower ( 317 mhz ) sidebands of the observations and yield flux densities of 42.1@xmath57.2 mjy and 72.5@xmath59.5 mjy , respectively .",
    "no significant differences are found in the shapes of the separate light curves generated for each sideband .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum04 ] shows the spectrum of  obtained by imaging pairs of adjacent frequency channels across the two sidebands .",
    "a power - law fit yields a very steep spectrum of @xmath12 for .",
    "an identical analysis of the data for the nearby strong source g358.638@xmath131.160 yields a spectral index of @xmath14 , consistent with the determination of @xcite who found a spectral index of  @xmath15 between  330 and  1400  mhz .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation was conducted to assess the confidence level of the steep spectrum obtained for the 2004 detection of .",
    "first , a spectrum was generated based on the fitted spectral index of @xmath16 and normalized to the observed flux density at a particular channel .",
    "one thousand spectra were simulated by randomly adding gaussian noise to the flux densities of the normalized spectrum , based on the observed noise level obtained for the individual channel images",
    ". a flat spectrum fit to the  data is ruled out with a confidence level of 99.7% .",
    "unfortunately , however , due to limitations in the analysis of the 2002 and 2003 observations , we were not able to detect reliable evidence of a steep spectrum for those bursts .",
    "no emission is detected from  when imaging the 2004 observation at times when the burst is not occurring . from these 2004 observations",
    ", we are able to improve the ( 5@xmath6 ) upper limit for quiescent 330  mhz emission between bursts to  6  mjy , as compared to earlier limits of  75  mjy and  25  mjy from the 2002 and  2003 observations , respectively .",
    "the upper limit on quiescent emission during periods of no burst activity is 15  mjy at  330  mhz @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find an upper limit of 50% circular polarization for the 2004 burst , while an upper limit of 15% was previously determined for both the 2002 and 2003 bursts .",
    "in @xcite we crudely estimated the activity of the bursting behavior of  by comparing the time during which the source is observed to be active to the total amount of observing time . with the addition of @xmath040  hr of 330 mhz vla observations analyzed in 2006 , with no detection ,",
    "the total observing time is @xmath0120  hr .",
    "the 2002 september  30 - october  1 bursts lasted for at least 6  hr , and since only a single burst was detected on  2003 september  28 and on 2004 march 20 , we assume that the source was active for  @xmath01  hr in each of these epochs . thus ,  has exhibited bursting activity approximately 7% of the time it was observed .",
    "the 2002 and 2003 detections of  occured in late september and the 2004 detection occurred in late march , suggesting a roughly 6-month interval between active periods . although we find no detections in our 1998 , 2002 , 2005 , and 2006 observations in march and september , it is still possible that bursting activity did occur in these months but was either too faint or lasted too short a time to be detected .",
    "similarly , while our database has many observations in 2002 , 2003 , and 2006 , we did not monitor for transients nearly as often in 2004 and 2005 , and useful archival data is very limited in those years .",
    "since we have now detected  in three significantly different observed states ( @xmath01  jy versus @xmath050  mjy burst strengths , @xmath010  min . versus @xmath02  min .",
    "burst durations , and regularly repeating versus isolated bursts ) , future detections may yet exhibit additional properties ( e.g. , emission in other frequency bands and polarized emission ) that will lead to a definitive understanding of the nature of .",
    "given the high variability in flux density already detected , and the very steep spectrum of the 2004 burst , it is even conceivable that bursts much stronger than @xmath01  jy will be detected at 330 mhz and lower frequencies , although it is also possible that the bursts are now continually decreasing in strength at all frequencies .",
    "we note that all three detections suggest strongly that  is a coherent emitter , as first indicated in @xcite , and now even more so by the very steep spectrum reported here .",
    "although the 2004 burst is much weaker than the previous bursts it also appears to have much shorter rise and decay times , @xmath17 , as seen in figure  [ fig : lightcurve04 ] .",
    "if we constrain the emitting region to be less than c@xmath17 , with @xmath17 @xmath01-min , then the brightness temperature of  is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the distance to the source .",
    "if the source is at the galactic center , @xmath08.5  kpc distant , its brightness temperature then still far exceeds the @xmath3k upper limit for an incoherent synchrotron emitter .    in summary ,",
    "the new detection of  consists of a single @xmath050  mjy burst lasting only 2-min and exhibiting a very steep spectrum ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the burst is significantly weaker and shorter than the @xmath01  jy and 10-min .",
    "bursts detected in 2002 and 2003 . like the 2003 detection",
    ", the single burst detected in 2004 appears to be an isolated one , although the sparse sampling of the observation does not rule out the possibility that additional bursts were emitted at the same 77 min .",
    "period observed in 2002 @xcite . given the @xmath0120 hrs of 330 mhz observations searched",
    ", we estimate that the source is in a detectable bursting state @xmath07% of the time .",
    "further , multi - wavelength observations are needed to better constrain the physical nature of .",
