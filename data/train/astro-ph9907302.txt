    "quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are most probably powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "the amount of accreted matter required to explain the the observed energy output of seyfert galaxies and quasars is 0.001 - 10 solar masses per year , while the central mass required to maintain steady accretion for the observed luminosity ( the eddington limit ) is of the order of @xmath0 . comparing these two numbers gives a timescale @xmath1 years , which indicates a timescale for the evolution of the mass and related properties , such as the emergent spectrum .",
    "as the mass grows due to the accreted material , the observed luminosity and spectrum change with time . since the continuum radiation ionizes the line - emitting material and drives the broad agn s , the change in the properties of the radiation from the central source changes also the properties of the emission lines .",
    "in particular the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation would determine the ( the ratio between the energy flux in the line to the continuum energy flux at the line frequency ) of the s.    the accretion disk postulated in agn provides a convenient ( although model - dependent ) framework for which the emergent continuum spectrum may be calculated ( e.g. sakura and sunyaev , 1973 ) , depending on the mass and the . alternatively , an empirical average agn uv spectrum may be related to the characteristic temperature of the .",
    "baldwin ( 1977 ) has shown that the of the civ   decreases with increasing continuum luminosity , a correlation known as the baldwin effect. a similar relation has been found also for other broad s. the origin of this effect is not understood ( for a recent review see shields and osmer , 1998 ) .    in the first paper in this series ( wandel 1999a , hereafter paper i ) we have argued that the is related to the mass .",
    "we have shown that the line decreases with increasing mass , so that the expected correlation between mass and luminosity in luminous agn implies an inverse correlation between and luminosity .    in this work",
    "we suggest that at least part of the can be attributed to evolution .",
    "we estimate the relation between the and the continuum spectrum , and calculating the evolution of the continuum emission from the for changing mass and we show that for plausible evolutionary tracks the is anti - correlated with the continuum luminosity .",
    "section 2 gives an empirical relation between the model parameters ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and the implied evolutionary time scales , as well as the _ observed _ spectrum and luminosity . in section 3",
    "we suggest some plausible evolutionary scenarios for the , and section in 4 we compose all these elements to produce the .",
    "in order to maintain steady spherical accretion the luminosity must be less than the luminosity , @xmath4 or @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the ratio , and @xmath8 .",

    "combining these two expressions gives the mass , accumulated if the accretion rate is maintained during a time @xmath9 : @xmath13    the timescale for evolution ( for example , significant change in the mass ) is given by @xmath14 for @xmath15 this gives @xmath16 yr for a and @xmath17yr for a kerr .",

    "in paper i we have demonstrated that the basic property of the spectrum - thermal emission in the uv spectrum - leads to a peak in the sed , at an energy that is weakly decreasing with increasing mass ; from the approximate shape of the optically thick spectrum @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is a normalization constant and @xmath23 is the cutoff frequency ) it is possible to derive an expression for the peak ( or cutoff ) energy of the uv spectrum :    @xmath24    where @xmath2517ev for an around a and @xmath2620ev for a disk around a maximally rotating kerr , and @xmath27 is related to the maximal temperature in the optically thick part of the disk by @xmath28 for a and @xmath29 for a kerr one ( malkan 1990 ) .",
    "plotting the cutoff frequency versus the luminosity it is possible to infer the mass and the ( or ratio ; fig . 1 in paper i ) .",
    "the @xmath30 ratio found in paper i is 0.01 - 1 for quasars , 0.001 - 0.1 for seyferts , while nls1s are all in the @xmath31 range .    a similar analyses for the has been performed by wandel and petrosian ( 1988 ) , who calculated for each pair of parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 the actual observables , e.g. the uv luminosity and spectral index rather than fitting the blue - bump .",
