    "nonlinear theories have been studied extensively in the context of various physical phenomena . in other words , because of the nonlinear nature of most physical systems , linear theories could not precisely describe the experimental consequences and we must inevitably consider the nonlinear models .",
    "classical electrodynamics , whose field equations originate from the maxwell lagrangian , contains various problems which motivate one to consider nonlinear electrodynamics ( nled ) .",
    "one of the main problematic items of maxwell theory is infinite self - energy of a point - like charge .",
    "the first successful lorentz invariance theory for solving this problem was introduced by born and infeld @xcite .",

    "whose first nonlinear correction is a quadratic function of maxwell invariant , are completely special @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interesting properties of bi - type nled theories @xcite , it may be shown that these theories may arise as a low energy limit of heterotic string theory @xcite , which leads to increased interest .",
    "taking into account the first leading correction term of bi - type theories in which originated from the string theory , one can investigate the effect of nled versus maxwell theory @xcite .    in this paper , we consider gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity as a natural generalization of einstein gravity with a quadratic power of maxwell invariant in addition to the maxwell lagrangian as a source . on the gravity point of view , string theories in their low energy limit give rise to effective models of gravity in higher dimensions which involve higher curvature terms , while from the electrodynamics viewpoint , a quadratic power of maxwell invariant supplements to the maxwell lagrangian with the development of superstring theory . in the weak field limit , gb gravity and the lagrangian of the mentioned nled reduce to einstein gravity and maxwell lagrangian , respectively .    on the other hand",

    "one may ask the motivation for considering the gb - mc gravity . as we know , the maxwell theory has acceptable consequences , to a large extent , in various physical areas .",
    "so , in transition from the maxwell theory to nled , it is allowable to consider the effects of small nonlinearity variations , not strong effects . in other words , in order to obtain physical results with experimental agreements , one should regard the nonlinearity as a correction to the maxwell field .",
    "eventually , we should note that , although various theories of nled have been created with different primitive motivations , only their weak nonlinearities have physical and experimental importance .",

    "as one can confirm , unlike ricci - flat solutions , the gb parameter in the spherical horizon of gb black holes contributes to finite mass , temperature and , consequently , heat capacity . in other words ,",
    "the gb parameter contributions lead to ensemble dependency in spherical horizon black holes .",
