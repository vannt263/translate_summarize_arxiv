    "recent advances in extragalactic astrophysics show the close link of a disk galaxy dynamical evolution and its chemical and photometric behaviour over the hubble timescale . in spite of remarkable succes of the modern theory of galaxy chemical evolution in explaining the properties of evolving galaxies ( @xcite ) its serious shortcomings concern the multiparameter character and practical neglecting of dynamical effects .",
    "the inclusion of simplified dynamic into the chemical network ( @xcite ) and vice versa the inclusion of simplified chemical scheme into the sophisticated 3d hydrodynamical code ( @xcite ) gives very promising results and allows to avoid a formal approach typical to standard theory .    in this paper",
    "the interplay between a disk galaxy dynamical evolution and its chemical behaviour is studied in a frame of a simplified model which provides a realistic description of the process of galaxy formation and evolution over the cosmological timescale .",
    "the evolving galaxy is treated as a system of baryonic fragments embedded into the extended halo composed of dark nonbaryonic and baryonic matter .",
    "the halo is modelled as a static structure with dark ( dh ) and diluted baryonic ( bh ) halo components having plummer  type density profiles ( @xcite ) :    @xmath0    and    @xmath1    where    @xmath2 @xmath3    the dense baryonic matter ( future galaxy disk and bulge ) of total mass of @xmath4 is assumed to be distributed among @xmath5 particles  fragments .",
    "the single particle density profile is also assumed to be a plummer one .",
    "its mass is taken to be @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 kpc .",
    "initially all particles are smoothly placed inside the sphere of radius @xmath8 kpc and are involved into the hubble flow ( @xmath9 km / s / mpc ) and solid  body rotation around @xmath10 axis .",
    "the initial motion of this system is described as :    @xmath11                     + h_{0}\\cdot { \\bf r } + { \\bf dv}(x , y , z),\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is an angular velocity of the rotating sphere , @xmath13 and    @xmath14    the components @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 of the random velocity @xmath18 vector are assumed to be initially randomly distributed within an interval @xmath19 km / s .",
    "the dynamical evolution of baryonic matter fragments which are subjected to gravitational influences of dm  baryonic halo and interfragment interactions is followed by means of effective n ",
    "body integrator with individual time step .",
    "the dynamics of such n  body system is described by following equations :    @xmath20    the acceleration of @xmath21 - th particle @xmath22 is defined as a sum of three components .",
    "@xmath23    where the first term @xmath24 accounts for gravitational interactions between fragments .",
    "the second one @xmath25 is defined as an external gravitational acceleration caused by the dm and baryonic halo .",
    "the last term @xmath26 corresponds to the viscous decceleration of fragment when passing through the baryonic halo .",
    "the gravitational interaction between fragments is defined as the interaction of @xmath27 plummer profile elements :    @xmath28    here @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "accounting for that the halo dm and baryonic components are also plummer spheres the second term becomes :    @xmath31    the form of the last term @xmath26 will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the characteristic time step @xmath32 in the integration procedure for each particle is defined as :    @xmath33 \\label{eq : def_dt}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 .    here",
    "the @xmath36 is a numerical parameter equal to @xmath37 that provides a nice momentum and energy conservation over the integration interval of about @xmath38 gyr .",
    "for example , in the conservative case ( when viscosity of the system is set equal to @xmath39 ) , the final total error in the energy equation is less than @xmath40 .",
    "the viscosity term @xmath26 is artificially introduced into the model so as to match the results of more sophisticated sph approach on dynamical evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "the best fitness of results of this simplified approach with sph modelling data ( see @xcite ) is achived when the momentum exchange between the baryonic halo and moving particles is modelled by the following expression :    @xmath41    here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are numerical parameters set equal to @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 kpc .",
    "the vector @xmath47 is a particle velocity vector .",
    "it is to be noted that single particle is assumed to have a total mass which does nt change with time and is defined as sum @xmath48 .",
    "but masses of its gas and star components @xmath49 and @xmath50 are variable values and are defined by the temporal evolutionary status of the given fragment .",
    "initially @xmath51 .",
    "the results of fitness show that for @xmath10 component of viscosity term @xmath52 . in the galaxy plane where it is necessary to account for baryonic halo and baryonic fragments partial corrotation the dynamical friction is decreased and for @xmath53 component of viscosity term @xmath54 reduced to the value @xmath55 .",
    "in the frame of the multifragmented model the definition of local gas density is introduced in the sph manner , e.g. local gas density depends on the total mass of matter contained in the sphere of radius @xmath56 around the @xmath21  th particle . for each @xmath21  th particle the value of its smoothing radius @xmath57 is chosed ( using the quicksort algorithm ) requiring that the volume of such radius compraises @xmath58 nearest particles ( i.e. @xmath59 1 % of total number of particles @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , the total mass @xmath60 and density of gas @xmath61 inside this sphere are defined as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is defined as    @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66",
    "a forming disk galaxy is modelled as a system of interacting fragments ( named as particles ) embedded into the extended halo .",
    "each particle is composed of gas and stellar components and its total mass is defined as @xmath67 .",
    "initially all particles are purelly gaseous and , therefore , initially @xmath68 . to follow a particle star formation ( sf ) activity a special timemark @xmath69",
    "is introduced which initially is set equal to @xmath70 .",
    "the particles eligible to star formation events are chosen as particles which still have a sufficient amount of the gas component and their densities exceed some critical value @xmath71 during some fixed time interval @xmath72 ( of order of free  fall time ) :    @xmath73    here @xmath74 myr , and @xmath75 @xmath45 ( this last value is not crucial and is only limiting one ) .",

    "is taken a standard value @xmath89 .    following the instantenuous recycling approximation it is assumed that after each sf and sn explosions the heavy element enriched gas is returned to the system and mixed with old ( heavy element deficient ) gas .",
    "after each act of sf and sn explosions the value of heavy element abundances of gas in particle is upgraded according to :    @xmath90    the value @xmath91 is used as an average value for all values of @xmath92 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "initially @xmath93 in all particles .",
    "the proposed simple model provides the self - consistent picture of the process of galaxy formation , its dynamical and chemical evolution is in agreement with the results of more sophisticated approaches ( see @xcite ) .    *",
    "the rapidly rotating protogalaxy finally formed a three - component system resembling a typical spiral galaxies : a thin disk and spheroidal component made of gas and/or stars and a dark matter halo .",

    "fig.3 shows the cylindrical distribution of stellar ( upper curve ) and gaseous ( lower one ) components of the final model disk galaxy as a function of a distance from the galaxy center in the galactic plane .",
    "+ the total star formation rate ( sfr ) is a succesion of short bursts which does nt exceed @xmath94/yr . during first @xmath95 gyr of evolution only about @xmath96 of total galaxy mass is transforms into the stars",
    ". the sfr gradually decreases , during the further evolution , to the value of about @xmath97/yr typical for our own galaxy .",
    "the final total stellar and gas mass of the model galaxy disk are about @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
