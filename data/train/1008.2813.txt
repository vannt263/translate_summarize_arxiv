    "the interferometric systems of the particle - antiparticle oscillations of neutral mesons are particularly sensitive to testing for cp and cpt violation .",
    "cp violation has been observed at small levels in a number of these systems@xcite , and the violation of cp symmetry is a necessary condition for the matter - antimatter asymmetry of our universe@xcite and for our very existence .",
    "however , the observed levels of cp violation in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems are not large enough to account for this asymmetry , implying the need for additional sources of cp violation beyond the standard model ( sm ) . both cp and cpt violation in the neutral @xmath2-meson system are considered below .",
    "in 6.1  fb@xmath7 of @xmath8 collision data , the d  collaboration first measures@xcite the raw dimuon charge asymmetry @xmath9 regardless of muon source . from pure physics processes at the primary interaction ,",
    "one of the very few sources of same - sign dileptons in the same collision event is due to @xmath2 physics .",
    "if there is a nonzero asymmetry after correcting for backgrounds , the assumption is that it is coming from neutral @xmath2-meson mixing , i.e. , the dimuon charge asymmetry of semileptonic @xmath2 decays @xmath10 the great majority of @xmath1 quark production at the tevatron is via @xmath11 , so this can occur , for example , when the @xmath1 quark decays semileptonically directly @xmath12 , but for the @xmath13 quark , there is first a @xmath2-meson oscillation before the semileptonic decay , i.e. , @xmath14 . another way to measure",
    "this asymmetry is via inclusive ` wrong - sign ' decays , i.e. , @xmath15 which is only possible through flavor oscillation of @xmath6 and @xmath4 . a semileptonic charge asymmetry",
    "can then be constructed : @xmath16 and probed by measuring the inclusive raw single muon asymmetry @xmath17 . assuming cpt symmetry holds",
    ", it can be shown@xcite that @xmath18 .",
    "both the raw asymmetries contain contributions from @xmath0 , other processes producing muons , plus detector related backgrounds .",
    "the background contributions to the asymmetries are mostly determined by independent measurements in the data , with minimal input from simulation .",
    "monte carlo simulation is only used to determine the remaining fraction of like - sign dimuons , and fraction of single muons from mixed @xmath1-hadron decays .",
    "the raw asymmetry @xmath19 is dominated by backgrounds , and the different signal and correlated background content of both asymmetries is used to minimize the total uncertainty on @xmath0 .    from @xmath20 muons in the inclusive sample , @xmath21 , and from @xmath22 events in the like - sign dimuon sample , @xmath23 .",
    "the most important detector - related background is having one muon from a semileptonic @xmath1-hadron decay , and the other from a decay in flight of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , subsequent punch - through to the muon detectors ( from showers in the material of the calorimeters ) , and sail - through of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where these hadrons are either from the other @xmath1-hadron decay or from fragmentation .",
    "the polarities of the d  detector toroid and solenoid magnets are switched every two weeks during data running , so that residual muon reconstruction charge asymmetries cancel to first order .",
    "this reduces these background asymmetries from @xmath29 to less than @xmath30 . without this capability , the systematic uncertainty on the final asymmetry would be substantially larger .    from the like - sign dimuon sample , after correcting for backgrounds , @xmath31 the corrected asymmetry from the inclusive single muon sample",
    "is used to constrain the backgrounds in the dimuon sample and a linear combination chosen to minimize the total uncertainty on @xmath0 arriving at : @xmath32 this result is 3.2 standard deviations away from the sm prediction for cpt - preserving t violation , which is@xcite @xmath33 and represents the first evidence for anomalous cp violation in the mixing of neutral @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the asymmetry above has contributions from both @xmath6 and @xmath4 oscillations , and using world - average values of mixing parameters@xcite , @xmath34 if the world - average@xcite value of @xmath35 from the @xmath2 factories running at the @xmath36 is input to the above , the value @xmath37 is obtained , less than three standard deviations from the sm prediction@xcite of @xmath38 due to the uncertainty on the coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ eq : combo ] ) .",
    "however , this still provides an interesting comparison to a d  result@xcite where cp violation is probed by the time - dependent angular analysis of decay products in @xmath3 where there is interference between the diagrams with and without ( @xmath39 ) mixing .",
    "the connection is through the expression@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the width and mass differences between mass eigenstates for the @xmath4 , and @xmath43 is the measured cp - violating phase angle between the complex off - diagonal mixing - matrix elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the comparison shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phis ] shows an intriguing similar trend in difference from the sm prediction of the two analyses .",
    "a cpt - violating effect in @xmath2-meson mixing was predicted some time ago @xcite as potentially arising from spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry in an underlying unified theory @xcite , and the  system is of particular interest for studies of cpt violation because several complete particle - antiparticle oscillations occur within a meson lifetime @xcite .",
    "working within the comprehensive effective field theory describing general lorentz violation at attainable energies known as the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite , each cpt - violating term in the sme lagrange density is the product of a cpt - violating operator and a controlling coefficient , and in this case a combination of the four sme coefficients@xcite @xmath46 .",
    "for these purposes , the asymmetry using single inclusive muons of ref .   and the combined asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : combo ] ) are irrelevant , and only the first asymmetry @xmath0 result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimuona ] ) is considered .",
    "a measure of cpt violation is given by the inclusive ` right - charge ' muon charge asymmetry @xmath47 of semileptonic decays of @xmath1 hadrons , @xmath48 in terms of this cpt asymmetry and the t asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : absl ] ) , @xmath49 assuming the only source of t violation is the sm contribution @xmath50 , combining with the d  dimuon asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimuona ] ) results in @xmath51 to interpret this as a measure of cpt violation in @xmath2-meson mixing , and in particular in the  system , the @xmath52 formalism@xcite is adopted that allows for cpt violation of arbitrary size , governed by a complex parameter @xmath53 of arbitrary size .",
    "the complex parameter @xmath53 can not be a scalar since cpt violation comes with lorentz violation@xcite .",
    "it must depend on the @xmath2-meson four - momentum and is therefore a frame - dependent quantity .",
    "the rotation of the earth relative to the constant vector @xmath54 generates a variation with sidereal time in @xmath53 , but it is possible to average over the sidereal time and the meson four - momentum .",
    "since the particle distributions from @xmath1-hadron decay for the tevatron collider are symmetric in local detector polar coordinates for d , the dependence on the spatial components @xmath55 cancels .",
    "details of the relationship between the asymmetry @xmath47 , the parameter @xmath56 specific for the  system , and the time component sme coefficient @xmath57 can be found in ref .  .",
    "assuming that the only source of cpt violation comes from  mixing , the value @xmath58 is found .",
    "this corresponds to the bound @xmath59 at the 95% confidence level . the value of eq .",
