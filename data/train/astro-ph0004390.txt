    "the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars pulsate in high - overtone non - radial p - modes (; ; , @xcite ; ) . the oscillation spectra of many of these stars reveal frequency multiplets  usually triplets  with equal frequency separations of the components .",
    "the separations are equal to , or very nearly equal to , the rotation frequency ( determined from the variation of spectrum and light as the star rotates ) .",
    "one explanation of the observed triplets is that a set of rotationally perturbed @xmath3-modes is excited , e.g. , @xmath4 dipole modes with @xmath5 , 0 , + 1 .",
    "the observed frequencies can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant that depends on the structure of the star @xcite . for a - star models with",
    "the expected pulsation modes for roap stars , found @xmath80.010 .",
    "however , in the best - observed roap star hr  3831 , were able to show that @xmath9 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude less than the lowest theoretically predicted values , and suggests that the frequency splitting is precisely the rotational frequency .",
    "another explanation for a frequency multiplet is a single pulsation mode ( e.g. , @xmath4 , @xmath10 ) whose amplitude is modulated by rotation .",
    "this naturally produces a frequency splitting that is precisely equal to the rotation frequency . in some roap stars ,",
    "the amplitude of the pulsation has been observed to modulate with rotation _ in phase _ with the magnetic variation . to explain this phenomena ,",
    "the oblique pulsator model was proposed by , and has been extensively developed by ( @xcite ; , @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic and pulsation axes are aligned but are oblique to the rotation axis .",
    "the observed amplitude modulation is then due to the variation in the angle between the pulsation axis and the line of sight as the star rotates .    in an alternative model , the spotted pulsator model @xcite , the pulsation and rotation axes are aligned ( or there are radial @xmath11 modes ) , but the ratio of flux to radius variations varies over the surface because of differences in the flux and temperature caused by spots associated with the magnetic field .",
    "the observed radial - velocity ( rv ) amplitude is then constant , but the photometric amplitude modulates as the star rotates .",
    "therefore , the two models can be distinguished by rv observations . found rv amplitude variation in hr  1217 which favoured the oblique pulsator model , but",
    "this star is multi - periodic , so the observed variation could have been caused by beating among pulsation frequencies .",
    "proposed that the two models could easily be distinguished by rv measurements of hr  3831 .",
    "this roap star has one dominant pulsation mode with a period of 11.7 min , has a large photometric amplitude modulation including a phase reversal ( , @xcite ) and is bright enough for accurate rv measurements ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we obtained time - series spectroscopy of hr  3831  over one week in 1997 march .",
    "preliminary analysis of the h@xmath0  rv measurements was presented by baldry , kurtz & bedding ( @xcite ; hereafter bkb ) and showed that the radial - velocity amplitude is modulated with the rotation of the star .",
    "a frequency analysis showed a frequency triplet with the same spacing and amplitude ratios as contemporaneous photometric observations .",
    "this is expected in the oblique pulsator model , and in clear disagreement with the prediction of the spotted pulsator model .    in this paper",
    "we describe more detailed analysis of our hr  3831  spectra using some of the techniques that were used by ( @xcite , @xcite ; hereafter b98 , b99 ) to study @xmath0  cir .",
    "these include cross - correlations of different wavelength regions , line - shifts of the h@xmath0  bisector and intensity measurements across the h@xmath0  line .",
    "while the oblique pulsator explains most of the observed rotational modulations , aspects of the spotted pulsator model and perturbed @xmath3-modes may also be required to explain our results .",
    "hr  3831  ( i m  vel , hd  83368 , hip  47145 ) has a binary companion with @xmath13 with a separation of 3.29 arcsec .",
    "the visual magnitude of hr  3831  is often quoted as @xmath14 , but this is from the combined flux measurement ( see ) . using the correct value of @xmath12 , the _ hipparcos _ distance of @xmath15pc @xcite , an effective temperature of @xmath16k @xcite and a bolometric correction of @xmath17 @xcite , we obtain @xmath18 and @xmath19 .. this may be due to propagation of a typographical error . ]    the oscillation spectrum of hr  3831  has a well - known frequency septuplet around 1428@xmath20hz , plus frequency multiplets at the harmonics @xcite",
    ". however , there are just four frequencies which have photometric amplitudes above 0.3mmag ( johnson @xmath21 ) and that are detectable in our data .",
    "these include a triplet around the principal mode ( @xmath22@xmath20hz , @xmath23@xmath20hz , @xmath24@xmath20hz ) and the first harmonic ( @xmath25@xmath20hz ) .",
    "the splitting of the triplet ( @xmath26@xmath20hz ) gives the rotation period @xmath27d , assuming the oblique pulsator model is correct . unlike the triplet in @xmath0  cir  @xcite , where the amplitudes of the two side - lobes are about 10 percent of the principal amplitude , the amplitudes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are larger than the amplitude of the central frequency",
    "this means that during the rotation cycle of hr  3831 , the amplitude measured at @xmath30 goes through two maxima with two phase reversals . in terms of the oblique pulsator model",
    ", the star pulsates in an @xmath4 dipole mode which is sufficiently oblique to the rotation axis that we see first one pole and then the other as the star rotates .",
    "kurtz , shibahashi & goode ( @xcite ; ) described a generalised oblique pulsator model in which the effects of both the magnetic field and rotation were taken into account ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "in this model , the perturbation to the star s eigenfrequencies by the magnetic field dominates , leading to the conclusion that the pulsation axis is locked to the magnetic axis .",
    "two parameters related to the amplitude ratios in the frequency triplet were defined : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight , and @xmath33 is the angle between the rotation axis and the pulsation axis ; and @xmath34 where the perturbation to the eigenfrequencies ( by the magnetic field ) depends on @xmath35 such that @xmath36 . from the measured photometric amplitudes for hr  3831  covering 1993 to 1996 @xcite , we derive @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "this rules out the spotted pulsator model . in this model ,",
    "the pulsation velocity amplitude and phase should be constant during the rotation of the star , which is clearly not the case .",
    "the excellent agreement between the h@xmath0  velocity and photometry , in terms of the relative modulation as a function of rotation phase , is reflected in the fact that the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are nearly the same between the two time series ( compare table  [ tab : hr3831-phot ] with band  87 from table  [ tab : hr3831-shifts ] ) . within the oblique pulsator model",
    ", these parameters are expected to be the same for different observables ( see section  [ sec : hr3831-data ] ) .",

    "therefore , this agreement between the h@xmath0  velocity and photometry argues in favour of the oblique pulsator model rather than for different modes .",
    "however , this is a weak argument because the amplitude ratios could be nearly the same even in the case of different modes .",
    "the main arguments against different modes come from the years of photometric analysis of hr  3831  ( e.g. : , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : ( i ) the frequency splitting is exactly or nearly exactly the rotation frequency ( see section  [ sec : hr3831-intro ] ) , and ( ii ) the ratios between the amplitudes of the frequency triplet has remained nearly constant over time . for these reasons ,",
    "it is considered unlikely that the observed frequency triplet in hr  3831  is caused by different modes , in particular rotationally perturbed @xmath3-modes .    in bkb",
    ", a possible rotational phase lag was noted , between the radial - velocity ( rv ) amplitude maximum and the photometric amplitude maximum , of about 0.06 rotation cycles .",
    "however , from the results shown in figure  [ fig : sa87-trip ] , the rv maximum and photometric maximum are within 0.02 rotation cycles of each other .",
    "the change from the earlier results arises from the use of a different telluric reference wavelength region . in bkb , a large region from 6865 to 6931",
    "was used , which included bands  80 , 81 and 82 , in order to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio . in this paper",
    ", we find a significant signal arising from the wavelength region of band  81 ( see table  [ tab : hr3831-shifts ] ) and this is likely to be the cause of the phase lag noted in bkb .",
    "band  80 alone is used as the telluric reference band in this paper because it has the lowest percentage ( about 2% ) of absorption that is attributable to lines from the star ( see discussion in section  5.1 of b98 ) . to summarise ,",
    "the h@xmath0  rv amplitude is better represented by the results in this paper , whereas the results in bkb are slightly contaminated by metal lines around band  81 .      the velocity amplitude and phase in hr  3831  varied significantly between different wavelength bands , as was seen in @xmath0  cir  ( b98 ) .",

    "there are two aspects to the results which we will consider : the modulation of the measured pulsation with rotation and the variation of the amplitude and phase between different wavelength bands .",

    "this is not as expected from the oblique pulsator model . in this model",
    ", for each band , the phase of @xmath28 and @xmath29 should be the same and the amplitudes should be nearly the same ( @xmath50 from table  [ tab : hr3831-phot ] ) . therefore , these results suggest that the two frequencies measured are separate modes , rather than rotational ` side lobes ' of one principal mode .",
    "however , there is strong evidence for the oblique pulsator model as described in section  [ sec : ha - vel - hr3831 ] .",
    "therefore , we need to consider another explanation within the framework of the oblique pulsator model .",
    "we first look at some selected bands , in terms of their modulation of amplitude and phase with rotation .",
    "recall that the oblique pulsator model involves parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( eqns .",
    "[ eqn : p1 ] &  [ eqn : p2 ] ) . all the measured spectroscopic observables in this paper produce values for @xmath46 that are within 3@xmath40 of the photometric value . however , there are large uncertainties in this parameter because it depends critically on the amplitude measured at @xmath30 , which is typically less than two or three times the noise level in our data",
    ".    the parameter @xmath47 can be measured with higher accuracy since it does not depend on the small central amplitude , and we find it does vary significantly between different observables . from the measured velocity amplitudes ,",
    "there are three spectral bands ( 18 , 33 and 58 ) that have values of @xmath47 that are formally 45@xmath40 different from the photometric value ( see table  [ tab : hr3831-shifts ] ) . to test whether this is a significant change or just a product of aliasing",
    ", we looked at the modulation in velocity amplitude and phase as a function of rotation phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : sa18-trip ] shows this modulation for band  18 .",
    "= 7.4 cm    while the amplitude modulation could be fitted reasonably well by scaling from the photometry ( dotted line ) , the discrepancy is obvious with the phase modulation .",
    "there is a noticeable pulsation phase change from rotation phase 0.8 through 1.0 to 0.2 , while the photometric phase is nearly constant .",
    "similar effects are evident from the other bands , 33 and  58 , for which the @xmath47 value is significantly different from the photometric value .",
    "figure  [ fig : p2-ampl ] shows a plot of @xmath47 versus the average amplitude of frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "= 7.0 cm    there is a noticeable tendency for higher amplitude bands to have lower values of @xmath47 .",
    "this could be related to the line - formation depth or position on the surface ( i.e. , spots ) .",
    "alternatively , a systematic effect ( e.g. , blending ) could be increasing the measured amplitude at @xmath28 only causing an increase in average amplitude and a decrease in @xmath47 .    as well as the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which relate the amplitudes of the frequency triplet",
    ", there are also phase differences between the frequencies .",
    "for many bands , there is significant difference between the phases measured at @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in our measurements ,",
    "the equality of phase @xmath51 and @xmath52 means that the amplitude maxima occur at rotation phases 0.0 and 0.5 with phase jumps in between .",
    "therefore , any phase difference , @xmath53 , implies that there is a shift of the amplitude maxima .",
    "for example , there is a small shift in the amplitude maxima of band  42 ( @xmath54 ) and larger shifts , but with lower s / n in the amplitude spectra , of bands  48 ( @xmath55 ) and  82 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sa48-trip ] shows the modulation for band  48 .",
    "note that the pulsation - phase jumps occur out of ( rotation ) phase with the photometric pulsation - phase jumps .",
    "= 7.4 cm    these results are not sufficient evidence to discard the oblique pulsator model , because they could be explained by variations in the ratios between the metal lines in the bands , due to spots , as the star rotates .",
    "alternatively , there is a possibility that there is an actual change in the pulsation phase and amplitude ( as opposed to a pseudo - change caused by a variation in blending ) associated with spots on the star .",
    "so while the spotted pulsator model is ruled out in its original form , spots may be having an influence on the pulsation .      in b98",
    ", it was suggested that the amplitude and phase variations between wavelength bands in @xmath0  cir  could be explained by a radial node in the atmosphere .",
    "we see amplitude and phase variations in hr  3831  that are somewhat similar in the case of @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl - ph-1 ] ) , and with smaller but still significant variations in the case of @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl - ph+1 ] ) .",
    "however , there is no obvious division between two sets of bands that are pulsating in anti - phase with each other , as was seen in @xmath0  cir   ( b98 ) .",
    "if these hr  3831  results represent true velocity amplitudes and phases at various depths in the atmosphere , then an explanation that includes running waves is necessary .",
    "alternative explanations could involve spots on the surface or blending , which causes the measured phase to deviate from the true velocity phase ( for further discussion see section  [ sec : depth - surf ] ) .",
    "in @xmath0  cir  we found intriguing behaviour in the h@xmath0  line that implied the existence of a radial node in the atmosphere ( b99 ) . we now describe a similar analysis for hr  3831 .",
    "the h@xmath0  line in each spectrum was divided into 25 contiguous horizontal sections , between relative intensities 0.35 and 0.9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr3831-sp - ha ] ) .",
    "= 7.0 cm    for each section , a bisector velocity ( average position of the two sides ) and a width were calculated . for the velocity measurements ,",
    "a telluric band ( no .  80 ) was used as a fiducial .",
    "the velocity amplitude and phase of the pulsation as a function of relative intensity in the h@xmath0  line are shown in figure  [ fig : hr3831-bis - vel ] , with measurements at frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the amplitudes and phases are in good agreement between the two frequencies , which means that the shape of the rotational modulation is similar for each velocity measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : bb03-trip ] shows the rotational modulation from the velocity at a height of 0.40 .",
    "= 7.4 cm    it is similar to the modulation from the cross - correlation velocity of h@xmath0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sa87-trip ] ) , but with about twice the amplitude .",
    "this is expected because the cross - correlation velocity is a weighted average of the bisector velocities and the velocity amplitude at 0.40 is higher than average .    the variation in amplitude and phase as a function of relative intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr3831-bis - vel ] ) is similar to that seen in @xmath0  cir , particularly the drop in amplitude between heights 0.4 and 0.6 ( a comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : bis - compare ] ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    however , assuming that the bisector line - shift represents the velocity at different heights in the atmosphere , we expect to see less relative variation in the bisector - velocity amplitude in hr  3831  than @xmath0  cir . this is because the separation between radial nodes in the atmosphere is larger in hr  3831  due to the fact that it pulsates at a lower frequency and that the two stars have similar fundamental properties .",
    "why are the behaviours of @xmath0  cir  and hr  3831  so similar ?",
    "two possible explanations are : ( i )  the h@xmath0  line forming region in hr  3831  is more extended than in @xmath0  cir  and coincidently the h@xmath0  bisector behaves in a similar way ; ( ii )  the assumption that the bisector represents velocities at different heights is incorrect .",
    "the variation in amplitude and phase is less similar to @xmath0  cir  above a height of 0.7 .",
    "for instance , there is a noticeable amplitude peak and phase reversal around 0.73 in the bisector of @xmath0  cir  which is not evident in hr  3831 .",
    "the bisector measurements above a height of 0.7 in @xmath0  cir  are partially affected by blending ( section  3.2 of b99 ) .",
    "therefore , some of the differences in the bisector - velocity results between the two stars are probably due to a difference in blending .",
    "to summarise , there is no significant difference in the rotational modulation of the bisector velocity between various heights . for the measurements below a height of 0.7 ,",
    "the relative variation in amplitude and phase is very similar to that observed in @xmath0  cir , which is puzzling . at each height , the amplitudes at the two frequencies in hr  3831  are about twice the amplitude of the principal frequency in @xmath0  cir .",
    "changes in the width of the h@xmath0  line in hr  3831  at various heights are shown in figure  [ fig : hr3831-bis - wid ] .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the width amplitude and phase represent oscillations about a mean width , with measurements at two frequencies .",
    "these measurements are related to intensity and ew measurements , with the line resolved vertically rather than horizontally .",
    "the advantage of width measurements is that the width is naturally independent of the bisector velocity , i.e. , the width is the difference in position between two sides of a line whereas the velocity is the average position . in order to compare with ew measurements ,",
    "the dashed line shows the simulated width amplitudes for the profile variation described in section  4.2 of b99 ( see also figure  6 of that paper ) with an ew amplitude of 1000ppm .",
    "the most striking feature of figure  [ fig : hr3831-bis - wid ] is the difference in the measurements between the two frequencies .",
    "this means that , unlike for the bisector velocities , the shape of the rotational modulation is varying between different heights .",
    "we show three examples :    1 .   figure  [ fig : bb12-trip ] shows the modulation in width amplitude and phase at a height of 0.36 .",
    "the pulsation width phase increases steadily during the rotation and @xmath47 is large ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "2 .   figure  [ fig : bb16-trip ] shows the modulation at height 0.42 .",
    "there is good agreement with the fit derived from the photometric triplet and @xmath47 is @xmath59 , which is close to the photometric value .",
    "3 .   figure  [ fig : ba31-trip ] shows the modulation at height 0.53 .",
    "the width phase decreases steadily during the rotation and @xmath47 is @xmath60 .",
    "= 7.4 cm    = 7.4 cm    = 7.4 cm    to check the lowest measurement at height 0.36 , which is sensitive to intensity changes in the core of the line , we took an intensity measurement using a filter with a full - width half - maximum of about 1 .",
    "this measurement showed a similar rotational modulation , with the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "something unexpected is certainly happening here .",
    "the h@xmath0  width changes at the two extremes , heights 0.36 and 0.53 , are in phase at rotation phases around 0.5 and 1.0 , but in anti - phase at phases around 0.25 and 0.75 . at both heights , the relative amplitude modulation ( as defined by the dashed line ) is less than for other observables .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig : hr3831-bis - wid ] , the simple explanation is that we are seeing two modes with different h@xmath0  profile variations .",
    "an alternative explanation  if hr  3831  is pulsating in an oblique mode  is that , as the star rotates , the profile variation modulates due to viewing different aspects of the same mode .",
    "observed radial - velocity variations in the roap star @xmath62  equ .",
    "their observations consisted of high - resolution spectra in the range 50006000 , covering 3.5h on 1994 september 13 .",

    "the difference between the results for @xmath62  equ  ( ) and those for the other two roap stars , in terms of the variation in phase between different metal bands , could be due to : ( i ) wavelength region studied , 50006000 vs.  60007000 , ( ii ) spectrograph resolution , 0.2  vs.  1.5 , ( iii ) pulsational characteristics of the stars",
    ". further high - resolution studies of these roap stars will be able to distinguish among these causes .",
    "what are the causes of the velocity amplitude and phase variations , and of the h@xmath0  bisector variations ?",
    "the main hypothesis is that there is a significant change in pulsation amplitude and phase with geometric depth in the atmosphere of an roap star , with a radial node of a standing wave situated in the observable atmosphere .",
    "absorption lines are formed at different depths and therefore sample different parts of the standing wave .",
    "this can explain a complete range of observed amplitudes plus a phase reversal .",
    "an alternative hypothesis for these variations is that the amplitude and phase of a non - radial pulsation mode will vary over the surface of a star , and that each spectroscopic observable is related to an integral over the surface .",
    "therefore , if the integrals are sufficiently different between observables , the measured amplitude and phase may vary significantly .",
    "these variations could be related to limb - darkening and/or spots .",
    "neither hypothesis can fully explain the range of phases seen in @xmath0  cir  and hr  3831 .",
    "blending effects may cause deviations from the true velocity phases that are in addition to any atmospheric depth and surface effects .",
    "the smaller phase variations seen in the high - resolution results of @xmath62  equ  lend some support to this .",
    "blending can be considered as blurring the distinction between velocity and temperature changes in a star .",
    "surface effects would be a good explanation if roap stars were pulsating in modes with @xmath74 because , for these modes , there are several patches on the surface that have alternating phase .",
    "however , the frequency triplets in many roap stars suggest that dipole modes ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) are predominant . for these modes ,",
    "the measured velocity amplitude and phase are not expected to vary significantly between different observables .",
    "for example , for a dipole mode with an axis that is aligned near to our line of sight , the pulsation phase will be the same across most of the viewed surface .",
    "the main arguments for depth effects being the principal cause of the amplitude and phase variations are : ( i )  a radial node is plausibly situated in the observable atmosphere ( gautschy , saio & harzenmoser @xcite ) , and ( ii )  the bisector velocity varies with height in the h@xmath0  line . in section  3.3 of b99 , the possibility of systematic errors causing the bisector - velocity variations was discussed . here",
    ", we make a simple calculation to test the accuracy of these velocities below a relative intensity of 0.7 in the line .    for @xmath0",
    "cir  and hr  3831  ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , we averaged the bisector - velocity amplitudes below a height of 0.7 ( giving half weight to the amplitudes between 0.6 and 0.7 ) in order to compare with the cross - correlation measurements .",
    "this is a plausible estimate for the cross - correlation because the slope of the h@xmath0  profile is steep and nearly constant between 0.4 and 0.6 , and is less steep above 0.6 . for @xmath0  cir",
    ", we obtained an estimate of @xmath75170ms@xmath48  while the actual cross - correlation measurements gave 168182ms@xmath48  ( depending on the band , nos .  8588 ) . for hr  3831",
    ", we obtained estimates of @xmath75340 and @xmath75290ms@xmath48  for the two frequencies while the actual measurements gave 338361 and 296318ms@xmath48  respectively .",
    "the good agreement , between the estimates obtained from the bisector analysis and the velocity amplitudes from the cross - correlation measurements ( using four different bands ) , argues that the bisector velocities are accurate .",
    "however , there is a similarity between the @xmath0  cir  and hr  3831  bisector results ( see figure  [ fig : bis - compare ] ) that is possibly inconsistent with depth effects being the cause of the bisector variations .",
    "this is because the pulsations of these two stars have significantly different periods ( 7 and 12 minutes ) and , therefore , have different vertical wavelengths , assuming that the sound speed is approximately the same between their atmospheres .",
    "if depth effects are causing the bulk of the observed bisector variations , the h@xmath0   line is formed over a larger vertical distance , and/or the sound speed is lower , in the atmosphere of hr  3831 .",
    "again , surface effects could explain the bisector variation in @xmath0  cir   and hr  3831  if they were pulsating in modes with @xmath74 ( see ) .",
    "therefore , we are left with two relatively straightforward explanations for the amplitude and phase variations : ( i )  the stars pulsate in dipole modes and the variations are caused by depth effects , or ( ii )  they pulsate in @xmath76 modes and the variations are caused by surface effects .",
    "a more complicated explanation could involve a combination of standing waves , running waves , surface effects , distorted modes and blending .",
    "there are many examples of rotational modulation shown in this paper .",
    "the large variation in the shape of the modulation between different observables was an unexpected result , for which we see three possible explanations :    1 .",
    "the oblique pulsator model is wrong and the observed frequency triplet is caused by three different modes .",
    "the oblique pulsator model is correct and the variations are caused by systematic errors in the measurements .",
    "the oblique pulsator model is correct but needs to be modified to include effects due to spots or some other mechanism .    in the first case",
    ", the relative amplitude between different modes would be expected to vary for different observables .",
    "this is the natural explanation for the differences between @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the metal - line velocity amplitudes and phases ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ampl - ph-1 ] and  [ fig : ampl - ph+1 ] ) and of the h@xmath0-width amplitudes and phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr3831-bis - wid ] ) .",
    "however , it would require some rotational phase - locking process to account for the frequency separations being equal to the rotation frequency .    in the second case",
    ", no simple systematic error could explain the variation in the shape of the rotational modulation .",
    "any such error would need to be varying with the rotation .",
    "for instance , a variation in blending could possibly account for the rotational modulation of the metal - line amplitudes and phases , but it could not account for the h@xmath0-width variations .    for the third case , we consider the h@xmath0  line because it is the least affected by blending .",
    "first , note that the intensity modulation , using a filter with a fwhm of about 6 , is fitted well by the rotational modulation derived from the photometric triplet .",
    "this means that the _ total intensity _ variations below a height of about 0.62 are in agreement with the oblique pulsator model .",
    "the bisector velocities are also in agreement , so it is only the width variations below 0.62 that are not in agreement with the model .",
    "perhaps this could be explained by hot spots in the upper atmosphere that cause significant amplitude and phase differences between pulsational temperature changes in and around the spots . as the star rotates , the effect on the h@xmath0  profile would vary , leading to a hybrid model combining spots with an oblique pulsator .",
    "it is clear that the high - resolution study ( r@xmath7740000 ) of different metal lines will be necessary to improve the understanding of the pulsation and the structure of the atmosphere in roap stars , because of the problems associated with blending at lower resolution ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "it will then be possible to compare the velocity amplitudes and phases between different atoms and ionization states .",
    "theoretical work needs to be done to calculate formation depths for individual lines , including the effects of diffusion and the magnetic field .",
    "the aim is to build up a coherent picture of the pulsation in the atmosphere .    of the results on @xmath0  cir  and hr  3831 ,",
    "the h@xmath0  profile measurements are least affected by blending and can not easily be improved using high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the profile measurements require a good continuum fit across the h@xmath0  line , which is about 100  wide in these a - stars .",
    "for this reason , a spectrum which is stable across at least 400  is preferable .",
    "this is harder to obtain with high - resolution spectroscopy due to the blaze pattern and the size of ccd detectors .",
    "although improvement could be made on the results using intermediate - resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath7915000 ) , modelling the formation of the h@xmath0  line is more important .",
    "determining depth and surface effects on the h@xmath0  profile will complement high - resolution spectroscopic and theoretical studies of metal lines .",
    "photometric oscillation spectra could be considerably improved from observations of roap stars using small space telescopes .",
    "two such missions plan to include roap stars as part of a project to measure oscillations in nearby stars ( _ mons _ , see ; and _ most _ ) .",
    "if successful , it will result in the detection of new modes and improved asteroseismology of the brightest roap stars .",
    "the spectroscopic study of the pulsations in roap stars has produced more questions than answers , due to the complexity of the observed spectral changes .",
    "for the same reason , the ` amount of information ' obtainable is very large ( e.g. , variations in amplitudes and phases ) compared to other pulsating stars .",
    "therefore , roap stars are prime stellar objects for testing diffusion , magnetic field and pulsation theories .",
