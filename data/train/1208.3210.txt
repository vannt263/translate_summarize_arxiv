    "the dynamic structure factor @xmath4 is a useful function of momentum and energy introduced by leon van hove @xcite , which contains information about density - density correlations and their time evolution .",
    "experimentally , @xmath4 can be accessed most directly by inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) , which has acquired greater importance with the advent of powerful synchrotron sources @xcite . however , since x - rays are strongly absorbed in materials with high density , ixs may be suitable mostly for low-@xmath5 systems . nevertheless , in the case of heavier elements",
    ", recent studies have shown that if the photon incident energy is near an x - ray absorption edge the cross section can be enhanced , and the resulting resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) offers a new window for probing both empty and filled electronic states @xcite .",
    "recent efforts to develop a first - principles formulation of the rixs spectrum explore an interesting hypothesis @xcite that the rixs cross - section is directly related to @xmath4 , complicating effects of the core hole notwithstanding .",
    "however , this claim remains controversial @xcite and must be checked by testing the theory against accurate experimental results @xcite .",
    "cu - k - edge rixs for cuprates @xcite probes the spectrum throughout momentum space encompassing many brillouin zones .",
    "therefore an important theoretical task is to produce realistic calculations of the dynamic structure factor within the framework of either many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) or time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite starting from a lindhard susceptibility representing the response of an unperturbed kohn - sham system . in particular ,",
    "local field effects @xcite are known to modify the spectral weight of both collective and single - particle excitations in the dynamic structure factor of solids .    in this study",
    "we focus on an approximation to efficiently calculate from one particle spectral functions the lindhard susceptibility @xmath0 .",
    "this approximation has successfully described the susceptibility of heavy rare earth elements @xcite and can also reliably describe the x - ray inelastic scattering momentum dependency in higher brillouin zones for an energy transfer @xmath6 where the single - particle excitations dominate . as an example we consider paramagnetic nd@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( ncco ) , which has a relatively simple , nearly two - dimensional metallic cu - o band near the fermi level .",
    "we identify important features throughout energy - momentum space and we delineate the specific manner in which @xmath7 decays as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "these results enable an assessment of the extent to which @xmath4 reproduces the rixs cross - section in a cuprate via direct comparison of the theory with corresponding experiments in extended regions of the momentum space .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the relevant formalism .",
    "the details of the electronic structure methods and the numerical schemes are given in section 3 .",
    "the theoretical results for @xmath7 are presented and discussed in section 4 , and the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in a periodic solid , the susceptibility becomes @xcite a tensor in the reciprocal lattice vector space @xmath9 .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem relates the dynamical structure factor @xmath10 to the susceptibility via @xmath11 } { 1-e^{-\\hbar\\omega / kt } } \\delta(\\textbf{q}-\\textbf{k}-{\\bf g } ) .",
    "\\label{eqs}\\ ] ] thus , ixs experiments do not probe all matrix elements of the response @xmath12 , but only the diagonal elements @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "the dyson orbitals can often be approximated reasonably by bloch orbitals as @xmath23 with the momentum density given by @xmath24 the label @xmath25 is a composite index that codes the bloch wave vector @xmath26 and the energy band index @xmath27 .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath28 of the periodic part of the bloch function are labeled by the reciprocal vectors @xmath29 . in this case , the dynamical structure factor at @xmath30 becomes @xmath31 the dominant part of @xmath32 is given by the partial sum of the real positive terms @xmath33 .",
    "next , following wen@xcite , we neglect the remaining complex terms because the randomness of their phases produces destructive interferences",
    ". a few straightforward algebraic simplifications then yield @xcite @xmath34 thus , our approximation scheme leads to an expression for @xmath7 similar to the free fermion form @xcite but with the spectral function @xmath35 expressed in terms of the bloch wave functions instead of plane waves .",
    "the approximation of eq .",
    "( 9 ) becomes exact when @xmath36 is large ( see e.g. ref .",
    "as already noted above , the asymptotic decay of the imaginary part of lindhard susceptibility as a function of @xmath8 is well described within the present framework .",
    "when @xmath8 is small , the most significant features of the susceptibility are produced by band structure effects , which are fully included in our approach .",
    "notably , the origin of major peaks in the imaginary part of the susceptibility lies in fs nesting.@xcite therefore , we expect our scheme to produce a reasonable approximation to the dynamical structure factor in materials .",
    "the dyson orbitals @xmath17 needed for the calculation of the spectral function @xmath35 , as already noted , can be reasonably replaced by the kohn sham orbitals obtained within the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the dft band structure calculations in ncco were performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) using an all - electron , fully charge self - consistent semi - relativistic ( kkr ) method @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure used for ncco was body centered tetragonal ( space - group i4/mmm ) with lattice parameters given by massidda _",
    "a self - consistent solution was obtained for @xmath37 with a convergence of the crystal potential to about @xmath38 ry . to demonstrate our approach in a relatively simple but interesting case , we restrict the calculation to a single band , namely the copper - oxygen band near the fermi level in ncco . in particular , the possible contribution of the nd f - electrons is neglected by removing the f orbital from the basis set after the nd self - consistent potential has been obtained.@xcite the electronic structure shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) has been produced with the minority spin part of the self - consistent ferromagnetic potential .",
    "the doping effects were treated within a rigid band model by shifting the fermi energy to accommodate the proper number _ x _ of electrons @xcite . in the electron momentum density ( emd ) calculations ( see ref . for details ) , the momentum mesh was given by a momentum step @xmath39 = @xmath40.@xcite the total number of momentum points is @xmath41 @xmath42 within a sphere of radius @xmath43 a.u .",

    "similar emd results for ncco have been obtained within the lmto@xcite .",
    "the resulting momentum density has the same symmetry as the copper - oxygen @xmath49 states in real space which form this energy band since the wave function in momentum space is the fourier transform of the wave function in real space .",
    "[ f1](b ) shows that the low intensity along the @xmath50 diagonal direction in the 2d - emd map is a signature of @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "moreover , since the radial momentum dependence of an atomic state of angular momentum @xmath52 behaves as @xmath53 at small momenta @xcite , the 2d - emd intensity at low momenta is from the o-@xmath54 orbitals , while the cu-@xmath55 orbitals contribute at higher momenta.@xcite this implies that the signal coming from the o-2@xmath56 states is more visible in the first brillouin zone while the cu-3@xmath57 states are better seen in higher brillouin zones .",
    "we can see from fig .",
