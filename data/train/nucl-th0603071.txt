    "this study is a consequence of open questions on the magnitudes of the total prompt energy release in fission , the total prompt energy deposition in fission , the components of these quantities , and their dependencies upon the kinetic energy of the neutron inducing the fission .",

    "[ fig23 ] for the total prompt energy deposition in fission . recommended new experimental measurements coming from this study are given in sec .",
    "it should be noted that the study relies primarily upon existing published experimental measurements and secondarily upon nuclear theory and nuclear models .",
    "therefore , new and higher quality measurements would improve the results presented here and , furthermore , would lead to a more complete understanding of post scission fission physics .",
    "the energy release in fission is obtained from energy conservation .",
    "if one considers the binary fission of an actinide nucleus of mass number @xmath3 induced by a neutron of mass @xmath4 , kinetic energy @xmath5 , and binding energy @xmath6 in the compound nucleus @xmath7 formed when the neutron is absorbed , then energy conservation gives    @xmath8    where the left side specifies the initial conditions prior to fission , the right side specifies the excited compound nucleus that is about to fission , and the second right side specifies the excited fission fragments just after binary fission has occurred .",
    "the notation here is that @xmath9 is a compound nucleus or fragment kinetic energy , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are stable masses , @xmath12 are masses of excited nuclei , all in units of mev ( @xmath13 has been suppressed ) , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to the light and heavy fragments occurring in the binary fission .    the neutron binding energy @xmath6 is obtained from the q - value for neutron capture ,    @xmath16    which , when inserted into eq .",
    "( 1 ) , yields    @xmath17    where we have written an excited fragment mass as the ground - state mass plus the excitation energy , namely , @xmath18 .",
    "this excitation energy will be dissipated by the emission of prompt neutrons and prompt gamma rays .",
    "the _ total energy release @xmath19 in binary fission is defined as the ground - state mass of the compound nucleus undergoing fission minus the ground - state masses of the two binary fission fragments _ , namely ,    @xmath20    where ( again ) the masses are expressed in units of mev @xcite .",
    "this equation also defines the total energy release in each stage of multiple - chance fission except for the average kinetic and binding energies of the neutron(s ) emitted prior to fission in each stage , which must be taken into account . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) yields a second expression for the energy release in fission :    @xmath21    in these equations , conservation of charge ensures that @xmath22 , and conservation of baryon number ensures that @xmath23 .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) the kinetic and binding energy of the neutron inducing fission explicitly appear , with a minus sign , but they also implicitly appear in the fragment excitation energies @xmath24 and @xmath25 . and for spontaneous fission one replaces ( @xmath26 ) with @xmath27 , while for photofission the replacement is @xmath28 .",
    "if we now sum the fragment kinetic energies and fragment excitation energies , eq .",

    "this means that the total energy release @xmath19 , the total fission - fragment kinetic energy @xmath35 , and the total fission - fragment excitation energy @xmath36 , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq4]-[eq8 ] ) , must be replaced by their average values as determined by weighting with the independent fission - fragment yields @xmath37 , where    @xmath38    leading to    @xmath39 [ m_{l}(z_{l},a_{l } ) + m_{h}(z_{h},a_{h})]}}{\\sum{y_{f } } } \\\\ \\label{eq10 } & = & \\langle t_{f}^{tot}\\rangle + \\langle e_{tot}^{*}\\rangle - ( e_{n } + b_{n } ) \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath40 [ t_{l}(z_{l},a_{l } ) + t_{h}(z_{h},a_{h})]}}{\\sum{y_{f } } } \\\\ \\label{eq12 } \\langle e_{tot}^{*}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sum{[y_{f } ] [ e_{l}^{*}(z_{l},a_{l } ) + e_{h}^{*}(z_{h},a_{h})]}}{\\sum{y_{f } } } \\label{eq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the sums are understood to be over either the light \\{@xmath14 } or the heavy \\{@xmath15 } fission - fragment yields .",

    "therefore ,    secondary fission products , @xmath47-decay energy spectra ,    antineutrino energy spectra , and subsequent delayed neutron energy    spectra play no role in the total prompt fission energy release .",
    "now the independent fission - fragment yields @xmath48 required in the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq9]-[eq13 ] ) can only be obtained by construction from the measured independent fission - product yields @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 stands for product ) , the measured average prompt neutron multiplicity as a function of fission - fragment mass @xmath51 ( where @xmath50 stands for prompt ) , and a gaussian or gaussian - like model assumption for the @xmath52 dependence of @xmath37 for fixed @xmath33 .",

    "* for the n + @xmath2pu system : *    @xmath83    for all three of these systems the average total fission - fragment and fission - product kinetic energies decrease with increasing incident neutron energy .",
    "the reason for this is that the fission - fragment yields for symmetric and near - symmetric fission are increasing with increasing incident neutron energy @xcite , but the total kinetic energies are at , or near , a minimum for symmetric and near - symmetric fission , thus decreasing the total kinetic energies with increasing incident neutron energy .",

    "11 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the n(thermal ) + @xmath0u system and fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the n(thermal ) + @xmath2pu system .",
    "a ( speculative ) underlying physics reason for the observed effect may be that the charge centers of the nascent fission fragments are slightly farther apart for symmetric fission than they are for asymmetric fission .    the n + @xmath2pu system , z=94 , has the largest kinetic energies of the three systems under study due to the coulomb force , while those of the two u systems , z = 92 , are comparable to each other and somewhat less .    the fission product kinetic energies , in addition to being the _ largest _ component of the average total prompt energy release in fission , are the most _ localized _ in energy deposition having corresponding ranges , for example , of @xmath84 [ microns ] in uranium .      the average total prompt neutron emission energy is equal to the average fission - fragment excitation energy leading to prompt neutron emission @xmath85 as given by eq .  ( [ excn ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that this quantity is not equal to the average total prompt fission neutron kinetic energy @xmath86 ( to be discussed in sec .",
    "5 ) because ( a ) the portion of the prompt neutron kinetic energy due to the motion of the fission fragments emitting the neutrons has not yet been included and ( b ) the binding energy @xmath87 of the neutron emitted does not contribute to the neutron kinetic energy .",
    "we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ excn ] ) as a function of the incident neutron energy @xmath5 as follows : first , the average prompt neutron multiplicities @xmath88 are taken from the endf evaluations @xcite which are based upon experimental data .",
    "these are shown for the three systems under study in fig .",
    "second , the average fission - fragment neutron separation energy @xmath75 is calculated as one - fourth of the sum of the two two - neutron separation energies for a given binary mass split in a seven - point approximation to the light and heavy mass peaks , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , so as to average over two each of the four possible odd - particle configurations .",
    "we find @xmath75 = 4.998 mev for the n + @xmath0u system , @xmath75 = 4.915 mev for the n + @xmath1u system , and @xmath75 = 5.375 mev for the n + @xmath2pu system .",
    "for the range of incident neutron energies considered here , it is a reasonable approximation that the @xmath75 values are constant , independent of the incident energy .",

    "equation ( [ epscm ] ) has been evaluated as a function of incident neutron energy for the three systems under study and the results are shown in fig .",
    "one sees that the values of @xmath76 generally increase with increasing @xmath5 , but decrease near 6 mev and 13 mev which are the approximate thresholds for 2nd- and 3rd - chance fission where the emission of 1 and 2 neutrons , respectively , prior to fission , reduce the fragment excitation energy available for neutron and gamma emission and , correspondingly , reduce @xmath76 .",

    "this study has relied primarily upon existing ( published ) experimental measurements and secondarily upon nuclear theory and nuclear models .",
    "contrary to basic physical intuition , it has been found that the energy release decreases somewhat with incident neutron energy and the energy deposition changes slightly with incident neutron energy .",
    "the main reason for this behavior is that symmetric fission increases with increasing incident neutron energy , but fission - fragment kinetic energies are at a minimum for symmetric fission .",
    "even more striking is the fact that the q values for fission are , on average , somewhat larger for symmetric fission than they are for asymmetric fission .",
    "the extra available fission - fragment excitation energy at symmetric fission , due to the smaller fragment kinetic energies and larger fission q values , results in a peak in the @xmath51 _ vs. _ @xmath33 curve , that is , the prompt neutron multiplicities are peaked at symmetric fission .",
    "these results would become more physically correct with a number of more complete and more accurate measurements over the incident neutron energy range .",
    "then , instead of the simple linear and quadratic energy dependencies used here , more realistic characterizations of the incident neutron energy dependencies could be performed , for example , near the thresholds for multi - chance fission . in the @xmath133 system",
    "this could already be done for the average total fission product kinetic energy @xmath134 , but is pointless to do so now because there are no measurements at all of the average total prompt fission gamma - ray energy @xmath135 as a function of incident neutron energy for this same system .",
    "the current experimental data for fission product kinetic energies in the @xmath136 and @xmath137 systems allow , at best , linear energy dependencies .",
    "these results would also become more physically correct if the calculations performed using the los alamos model @xcite were replaced by the identical calculations performed using a modern hauser - feshbach approach . here the competition between neutron and gamma emission from fission fragments would be treated exactly and the angular momentum dependencies would be treated for each particle type emission .",
    "however , such an approach does not yet exist because not enough is known to adequately specify the fission fragment initial conditions across the fragment mass and charge distributions .",
    "namely , ( a ) the partition of fissioning compound nucleus excitation energy between the light and heavy fragments , ( b ) the fragment initial angular momenta , and ( c ) the fragment initial parities , must all be specified for approximately 400 fragments .",
    "in addition , the fragment mass and charge yield distributions must be known as a function of incident neutron energy in order to properly weight the approximately 400 hauser - feshbach results for each incident neutron energy .",
    "there does not yet exist a calculation of these yield distributions of sufficient accuracy to perform this task , and measured fission product mass and charge yield distributions allowing construction of the corresponding fragment distributions are sufficiently complete at only two incident neutron energies : thermal and 14 mev .",
    "it is astonishing to find that after some 60 years of fission studies the post - scission fission observables for the three major actinides @xmath0u , @xmath1u , and @xmath2pu have been so incompletely measured and understood . as a consequence of this work the following measurements are recommended for the three systems studied :      ( a ) : :    the average total fission - product kinetic energy should be measured    from 10 kev to 30 mev .",

( a ) : :    the average total prompt fission gamma - ray energy should be measured    from 10 kev to 30 mev . apparently , no measurements exist .",
    "( b ) : :    the prompt fission neutron spectrum ( out to 15 mev emitted neutron    energy ) should be measured for incident neutron energies of 4 , 10 , and    the range 12 to 30 mev .      (",
