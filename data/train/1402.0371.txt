    "multiscale dynamics is present in many phenomena , e.g. , turbulence @xcite , finance @xcite , geosciences @xcite , etc , to quote a few",
    ". it has been found in many multiscale dynamics systems that the self - similarity is broken , in which the concept of multiscaling or multifractal is relevant @xcite .",
    "this is characterized conventionally by using the structure - functions ( sfs ) , i.e. , @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 is an increment with separation scale @xmath2 .",
    "note that for the self - similarity process , e.g. , fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , the measured @xmath0 is linear with @xmath12 . while for the multifractal process , e.g. , turbulent velocity , it is usually convex with @xmath12 .",
    "other methods are available to extract the scaling exponent . for example , wavelet based methodologies , ( e.g. , wavelet leaders , wavelet transform modulus maxima @xcite ) , hilbert - based method @xcite , or the scaling analysis of probability density function of velocity increments @xcite , to name a few .",
    "each method has its owner advantages and shortcomings .",
    "for example , the classical sfs is found to mix information of the large- ( resp . known as infrared effect ) and small - scale ( resp . known as ultraviolet effect )",
    "structures @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scaling exponent @xmath0 is thus biased when a large energetic structure is present @xcite .",
    "previously the influence of the large - scale structure has been considered extensively by several authors @xcite .",
    "for example , praskvosky et al .",
    ", @xcite found strong correlations between the large scales and the velocity sfs at all length scales .",
    "sreenivasan & stolovitzky @xcite observed that the inertial range of the sfs conditioned on the large scale velocity show a strong dependence .",
    "huang et al . , @xcite showed analytically that the influence of the large - scale structure could be as large as two decades down to the small scales .",
    "blum et al .",
    ", @xcite studied experimentally the nonuniversal large - scale structure by considering both conditional eulerian and lagrangian sfs .",
    "they found that both sfs depend on the strength of large - scale structures at all scales . in their study , the large - scale structure velocity is defined as two - point average , i.e. , @xmath13/2 $ ] , in which @xmath14 is the vertical velocity in their experiment apparatus .",
    "note that they conditioned sfs on different intensity of @xmath15 .",
    "later , blum et al .",
    ", @xcite investigated systematically the large - scale structure conditioned sfs for various turbulent flows .",
    "they confirmed that in different turbulent flows the conditioned sfs depends strongly on large - scale structures at all scales .    in this paper ,",
    "a detrended structure - function ( dsf ) method is proposed to extract scaling exponents @xmath0 .",
    "this is accomplished by removing a @xmath1st - order polynomial within a window size @xmath2 before calculating the velocity increment .",
    "this procedure is designated as detrending analysis ( da ) . by doing so , scales larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 , are expected to be removed or constrained .",
    "hence , the da acts as a high - pass filter in physical domain .",
    "meanwhile , the intermittency is still retained .",
    "a velocity increment @xmath16 is then defined within the window size @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath12th - order moment of @xmath16 is introduced as @xmath12th - order dsf .",
    "the dsf is first validated by using a synthesized fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) and a lognormal process with an intermittent parameter @xmath17 respectively for mono - fractal and multifractal processes .",
    "it is found that dsfs provide comparable scaling exponents @xmath0 and singularity spectra @xmath4 with the ones provided by the original sfs .",
    "when applying to a turbulent velocity with a reynolds number @xmath18 , the @xmath19rd - order dsf shows a clear inertial range @xmath7 , which is consistent with the one predicted by the fourier power spectrum @xmath20 , e.g. , @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , a compensated height of the @xmath19rd - order dsf is @xmath21 .",
    "this value is consistent with the famous kolmogorov four - fifth law .",
    "the directly measured scaling exponents @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "singularity spectrum @xmath4 ) agree very well with the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter @xmath9 . due to the large - scale effect , known as infrared effect , the sfs are biased .",
    "note that the scaling exponents are extracted directly without resorting to the extended - self - similarity ( ess ) technique .",
    "the method is general and could be applied to different types of data , in which the multiscale and multifractal concepts are relevant .",
    "we start here with a scaling process @xmath22 , which has a power - law fourier spectrum , i.e. , @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is the scaling exponent of @xmath25 .",
    "the parseval s theorem states the following relation , i.e. , @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is ensemble average , @xmath25 is the fourier power spectrum of @xmath22 @xcite .",

    ", a linear trend is removed within a window size @xmath2 . ideally , scales larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath36 are removed or constrained from the original data @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the da procedure is a high - pass filter in the physical domain .",
    "the kinetic energy of @xmath37 is related directly with its fourier power spectrum , i.e. , @xmath38 in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the fourier power spectrum of @xmath37 .",
    "this illustrates again that the da procedure acts a high - pass filter , in which the lower fourier modes @xmath41 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) are expected to be removed or constrained . for a scaling process , i.e. , @xmath42 , it leads a power - law behavior , i.e. , @xmath43 the physical meaning of @xmath44 is quite clear .",
    "it represents a cumulative energy over the fourier wavenumber band @xmath45 $ ] ( resp . scale range @xmath46 $ ] ) .",
    "we emphasize here again that the da acts as a high - pass filter in physical domain and the intermittency nature of @xmath22 is still retained .",
    "the above mentioned detrending analysis can remove / constrain the large - scale influence , known as infrared effect .",
    "this could be utilized to redefine the sf to remove / constrain the large - scale structure effect as following .",
    "after the da procedure , , the velocity increment can be defined within a window size @xmath2 as , i.e. , @xmath47 in which @xmath30 represents for the @xmath30th segment .",
    "we will show in the next subsection why we define an increment with a half width of the window size .",
    "a @xmath12th - order dsf is then defined as , i.e. , @xmath48 for a scaling process , we expect a power - law behavior , i.e. , @xmath49 in which the scaling exponent @xmath0 is comparable with the one provided by the original sfs .    to access negative orders of @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "the right part of the singularity spectrum @xmath4 , see definition below ) , the dsfs can be redefined as , i.e. , @xmath50 in which @xmath51 is local average for the @xmath30th segment .",

    ", one has the following weight function @xcite , i.e. , @xmath63 for a scaling process , one usually has a fast decaying fourier spectrum , i.e. @xmath42 with @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the contribution from small - scale ( resp .",
    "high wavenumber fourier mode ) is decreasing .",
    "the sfs might be more influenced by the large - scale part for large values of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for the detrended data , the corresponding weight function is ideally to be as the following , i.e. , @xmath65 the dsfs ( resp .",
    "the combination of the da and sf ) have a weight function , i.e. , @xmath66 comparing with the original sfs , the dsfs defined here can remove / constrain the large - scale effect .",

    "the detrended scale @xmath2 is illustrated by a vertical line , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "we note here that with the definition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dvi ] ) , @xmath61 provides a better compatible interpretation with the fourier power spectrum @xmath25 since we have @xmath67 .",

    "the above argument is exactly valid for linear and stationary processes . in reality , the data are always nonlinear and nonstationary for some reasons , see more discussion in ref .",

    "another comment has to be emphasized here for the detrending procedure .",
    "several approaches might be applied to remove the trend @xcite . however , the trend might be linear or nonlinear .",
    "therefore , different detrending approaches might provide different performances . in the present study",
