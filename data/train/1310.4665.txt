    "this paper concerns the application of a cluster expansion technique to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover of a dilute gas of two - component fermi particles with zero - range interaction , as has been realized using ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "here , the zero - range means that the range of the inter - particle potential @xmath0 is much shorter than the inverse fermi wavenumber @xmath1 , the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath3 , and the thermal de broglie length @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of a particle and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "it is widely held that this system possesses a universal property that the equation of state depends only on @xmath3 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , and that the phase diagram is characterized by the temperature @xmath10 and the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fermi temperature .",
    "therefore , this system provides a simple universal model for understanding various degenerate fermi systems such as a quark - gluon plasma @xcite , neutron stars @xcite , excitons @xcite , and high-@xmath13 superconductors @xcite .",
    "there are many theoretical approaches to the phase transition based on unbiased quantum monte carlo techniques @xcite , a functional renormalization group method @xcite , and feynman diagrammatic techniques @xcite .",
    "( 245,110 ) ( 25,-5 ) and the inverse scattering length @xmath11 . in this paper",
    ", we establish the theory , which correctly captures the physics in ( i ) the weak- and ( ii ) strong - coupling limits at and above the transition temperature and ( iii ) in the high - temperature regime for any @xmath14 based on the lee - yang cluster expansion method .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in this paper , we provide a new approach to the phase transition of this system based on cluster expansion in terms of the fugacity @xmath15 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath16 is the chemical potential .",
    "although the cluster - expansion approach is usually applied at high temperatures @xcite , we show that it can be applied to evaluate the transition temperature for the onset of quantum condensation of the bcs - bec crossover  la lee and yang .",
    "the method of lee and yang @xcite allows systematic evaluation of the higher - order cluster integrals in terms of the cluster functions ( ursell functions ) which are in terms of the quantum - mechanical problem with boltzmann statistics .",
    "we show that the proposed theory correctly captures the physics in the weak - coupling , strong - coupling , and high - temperature regimes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bcs - bec_crossover ] ) .",
    "we can evaluate the transition temperature by analyzing an emergence of the singularity of an infinite series of cluster functions .",
    "we identify a certain infinite series of cluster functions , the sum of which has the following three properties : ( i ) in the weak - coupling limit ( so - called bcs limit ) , it gives the thouless criterion @xcite and hence the transition temperature of the bcs theory , and the number equation of the bcs - bec crossover theory of nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) @xcite ; ( ii ) in the strong - coupling limit ( so - called bec limit ) , it reproduces the thermodynamic function of non - interacting tightly bound dimers ; ( iii ) in the high - temperature regime @xmath17 for an arbitrary @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath14 , it reproduces the exact second virial coefficient and thus tan s contact @xcite up to the same order .",
    "all of these suggest that our theory provides a good starting point to describe the entire bcs - bec crossover .",
    "we mention here recent cluster - expansion studies of evaluating the low - order cluster integrals ( or the virial coefficients ) @xcite .",
    "these studies have an advantage over a feynman diagrammatic technique because the fugacity @xmath18 is a controllable small parameter when the system is dilute and at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , the equation of state of a homogeneous fermi gas in the unitary limit ( @xmath19 ) has recently been measured by using a two - component mixture of @xmath20li atoms @xcite .",
    "these experiments demonstrate that the low - order ( third - order ) cluster expansion quantitatively describes the equation of state down to temperatures as low as the fermi temperature ( @xmath17 ) , which corresponds to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "although the low - order cluster expansion well describes the region @xmath21 , a perturbative cluster - expansion calculation can not describe the phase transition , because a thermodynamic function , which is obtained by a low - order - cluster - expansion calculation , is a polynomial of @xmath18 and thus has no singularity corresponding to the phase transition point .",
    "in fact , the fugacity at the superfluid phase transition @xmath22 is greater than @xmath23 @xcite . therefore , to analyze the phase transition",
    ", we should take into account higher - order terms appropriately . in the present study",
    ", we demonstrate that a cluster - expansion method can be used to evaluate the transition temperatures of the bcs - bec crossover , at least in the weak- and strong - coupling limits .",

    "ii , we formulate the cluster - expansion method for the case of ( pseudo ) spin-@xmath24 fermi systems . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our model and apply the cluster - expansion method of lee and yang to this model .",
    "we calculate the second cluster integral for an arbitrary @xmath2-wave scattering length , which reproduce the standard beth - uhlenbeck result @xcite and tan s contact up to the same order @xcite .",
    "our method can thus treat effects of quantum - mechanical scattering and a bound state at least at the level of the second cluster integral . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the lee - yang method to evaluate the transition temperature for the onset of quantum condensation of the bcs - bec crossover . in the weak - coupling limit , we reproduce the thouless criterion and the number equation of the bcs - bec crossover theory by nsr . in the strong - coupling limit",
