    "the evolution of a small perturbation in a black hole background geometry gives rise , under appropriate boundary conditions to a discrete set of complex frequencies called quasinormal frequencies .",
    "actually , the evolution of a perturbation , taking for instance the schwarzschild black hole , can be divided in three stages .",
    "the first stage is a signal highly dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "intermediate times are characterized by a exponential decay , with the frequencies determined by the quasinormal modes , that depends upon the parameters of the black hole .",
    "late times are generally characterized by a power - law tail @xcite .    studying the quasinormal spectrum of black holes we can gain some valuable information about these objects , since quasinormal evolution depends only upon the parameters of black hole itself .",
    "thus these frequencies represents the characteristic resonance spectrum of a black hole response @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can investigate the black holes stability against small perturbations . in this context",
    ", several numerical methods have been developed that allow us to make the necessary calculations with an appropriate precision .",
    "@xcite .",
    "further contexts include astrophysical black holes @xcite @xcite and the ads / cft correspondence , where the inverse of imaginary part of quasinormal frequencies of ads black holes can be interpreted as the dual cft relaxation time @xcite @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem consists in determining what changes appears in the quasinormal mode spectrum of a black hole if we consider such a system surrounded by a quantum field with a semiclassical gravity , leading to a quantum corrected line element for the dressed black hole .",
    "the stress energy tensor of the quantum field surrounding the classical compact object contains all the necessary information to treat the above mentioned problem , as it enters as a source in the semiclassical einstein equations leading to a dressed black hole solution @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the exact determination of the quantum stress energy tensor in the general case is a very difficult task , and consequently there exist in the literature several approaches to obtain this quantity , including numerical ones . due to the fact that the principal interest in further applications is not the quantum stress energy tensor itself , but rather its functional dependence on a wide class of metrics ,",
    "it is obvious that we need , at least partially , to use approximate methods to develop a tractable expression for this quantity . also there",
    "exist another difficulty with semiclassical gravity , and is the fact that the quantum fluctuations of the metric and the associated additional graviton contribution to the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor are ignored .",
    "in fact , the effect of linear gravitons contribute a term to the stress energy tensor of the same order as those coming from ordinary matter and radiation fields , and one should include this contribution . a popular solution to this difficulty is to study the separated effects of different sorts of quantized fields in classical spacetimes @xcite . in this way one develops knowledge of the type and range of physical effects created by quantum fields .",
    "if one has examined a quite wide selection of other quantum fields , then it is justifiable to assume that the graviton contribution will not be extremely different @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonable to ignore the graviton contribution to the stress energy tensor when one is computing the metric backreaction caused by other quantized matter fields alone to first order .",
    "a consequence of this approach is that the backreaction is only meaningful in a perturbative sense , and the effect of the stress energy tensor for the quantum matter fields is regarded as a perturbation of the classical spacetime geometry .",
    "thus , in semiclassical gravity , having a general analytic expression for the quantum stress tensor , we can find a perturbative solution to the backreaction problem and seek for a quantum corrected metric .",
    "there exist some results in the literature , since the pioneering work of york @xcite , who solved the semiclassical einstein equations for a schwarzschild black hole dressed by a massless conformally coupled scalar field , using for the quantum stress energy tensor the results given earlier by page @xcite .    in a previous paper ,",
    "konoplya@xcite studied for the first time the influence of the semiclassical backreaction upon black hole quasinormal modes .",
    "he investigated the particular case of a btz black hole dressed by a massless conformal scalar field , in which the particle creation around the event horizon dominates over the vacuum polarization effect . in this particular case ,",
    "the 2 + 1-dimensional character of the metric ensures that the quantum corrected solution is self - consistent in the sense that the only quantum corrections to the geometry are coming from quantum matter fields , and there are no corrections from graviton loops .    to make a similar study in the four - dimensional case is more complicated , for the difficulty mentioned before regarding the ignorance of graviton contribution to the quantum stress energy tensor .",
    "in addition , for massless fields , the quantum corrected metric components diverge as @xmath0 and to obtain the correct solutions to the backreaction problem we need to impose some sort of boundary to the system under study .",
    "for the study of the corresponding quasinormal modes we have to deal with an effective potential with a step function or a delta function at the location of the boundary shell .",
    "this feature in the effective potential changes the spectrum .",
    "for this reason , we need to develop a model independent approach for the determination of the quasinormal frequencies in those cases , in such a way that the effective potential does not depend on the location of the boundary needed to fix the semiclassical solution @xcite .    however , massive fields are good candidates for investigating the influence of their quantization on quasinormal modes .",
    "vacuum polarization effects for very massive fields are not difficult to compute since there exist an exact analytic approximation for the quantum stress energy tensor , based on the schwinger - dewitt expansion of the quantum effective action @xcite . using the first non divergent term in this expansion as the effective action ( one - loop approximation ) , we can obtain a general analytical expression for the quantum stress energy tensor by functional differentiation with respect to the metric tensor , and solve the backreaction problem in a general analytical way .",
    "with respect to the validity of the schwinger - dewitt approximation , it is well - known that this method can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds , whenever the compton s wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature @xcite .    this paper is devoted to find this vacuum polarization effects upon quasinormal modes of quantum corrected reissner - nordstrm black holes in four dimensions . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt to go beyond the 2 + 1-dimensional case in the calculations of this type , considering the more realistic case of a four dimensional black hole solution .",
    "we performed the calculations considering the case of a quantized massive scalar field as a source to the semiclassical einstein equations . in the first section",
    "we explain how to obtain analytical expressions for the quantum stress tensor for a massive scalar field in the large mass limit , using a schwinger -dewitt approximation to construct the one - loop effective action , and present the results in a particular classical background given by the reissner - nordstrom spacetime .",
    "section 2 is devoted to solve the general backreaction problem for a general spherically symmetric spacetime , in terms of the components of the quantum stress energy tensor , and presents the particular results obtained for an electrically charged semiclassical black hole . in section 3",
    "we consider the evolution of a massless test scalar field coupled to the semiclassical background and solve the klein - gordon equation by separation of variables , determining the form of the effective potential for the test field .",
    "section 4 contains the numerical results for the quasinormal frequencies of the semiclassical black hole considered , and we make a comparison with the bare classical reissner - nordstrm solution . finally in section 5",
    "we give the concluding remarks and comment future related problems to be studied .    in the following we use for the riemann tensor , its contractions , and the covariant derivatives the sign conventions of misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite .",
    "our units are such that @xmath1 .",
    "consider a single quantum scalar field @xmath2 with mass @xmath3 interacting with gravity with non minimal coupling constant @xmath4 in four dimensions . in the large mass limit the one loop effective action for the quantized scalar field @xcite is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the functional supertrace of @xmath7@xcite , and @xmath8 is the coincidence limit fourth hadamard - minakshisundaram - dewitt - seeley coefficient ( hmds ) .",
    "as usual , the first three coefficients of the dewitt - schwinger expansion , @xmath9 contribute to the divergent part of the action and can be absorbed in the classical gravitational action by renormalization of the bare gravitational and cosmological constants . upon inserting the expression for the hmds coefficient in the above formula for the effective action",
    "we obtain a renormalized effective lagrangian @xcite given by @xmath10 where the conformal part of the effective lagrangian is @xmath11\\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the mass dependent contribution takes the form @xmath12 , \\ ] ] where we use @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    by standard functional differentiation of the effective action with respect to the metric , the renormalized stress - energy tensor is obtained being given by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 tensors take cumbersome forms that the reader can find in @xcite .",
    "different but equivalent expressions for the renormalized stress tensor at one - loop level were obtained in references @xcite .    for the present work we deal with the reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "this results can be found in the paper by matyjasek @xcite and is amazingly simple : @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 in the above expressions , we have @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the charge and bare mass of the black hole .",
    "these results were obtained using the expression for the stress energy tensor presented in @xcite and coincides with that previously obtained by matyjasek in @xcite using also the schwinger - dewitt approximation for ricci flat spacetimes and by anderson , hiscock and samuel in reference @xcite using sixth order wkb approximation for the mode functions of the klein - gordon equation in the background spacetime .",
    "moreover , the above stress energy tensor is covariantly conserved , and in the limit of zero black hole electric charge we obtain the results of frolov and zelnikov for the schwarzshild spacetime .",
    "also the quantum stress energy tensor is regular at the event horizon , as is to be expected due to the local nature of the schwinger - dewitt approximation and the regular nature of the horizon .    in our chosen system of units",
    "the general condition for the validity of the schwinger - dewitt approximation can be put as @xmath29 , where @xmath3 and @xmath28 are respectively the scalar field and black hole masses . a more specific condition valid for reissner - nordstrom ( r - n ) spacetimes was given by anderson et.al in reference @xcite , where they show , using detailed numerical results , that for @xmath30 the deviation of the approximate stress energy tensor from the exact one lies within a few percent .",
    "in all the numerical calculations presented in the following sections of this paper , we carefully take into account the fulfillment of this condition .    in the next section we use these results to get the solution of semiclassical einstein equations in the form of a semiclassical electrically charged black hole",
    "in this section we show how to solve the general backreaction problem for spherically symmetric spacetimes applying general results to the particular case of an electrically charged semiclassical black hole , obtaining the quantum correction to the classical reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "there are previous studies on this direction @xcite , but we present here general results that can be applied to any spherically symmetric spacetime , following the lines of reference @xcite .",
    "consider the line element for a general spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath31 we intend to solve the general semiclassical einstein equations with the source @xmath32 including two contributions : the first , denoted by @xmath33 , comes from a classical source , and the second , denoted by @xmath34 , is the quantum field contribution . in the following , we assume that the classical source is an electromagnetic field , so the solution to the backreaction problem gives a quantum corrected reissner - nrstrom black hole .",
    "it is possible to show , using appropiate combinations of the components of the ricci tensor for the line element ( [ ssmetric ] ) , that the general form for the metric components @xmath35 and @xmath36 that solves the backreaction problem are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 in the above equations @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the charge and the bare mass of the black hole , i.e , of the classical reissner - nrdstrm solution . as we can easily see from expression ( [ grrcomponent ] ) the mass of the black hole changes due to quantum effects .",
    "note that the general solutions above are obtained using the same boundary conditions of reference @xcite , which differs from that of berej and matyjasek in reference @xcite that uses a horizon defined mass as the parameter in their final expressions .",
    "usually , the integrals in ( [ grrcomponent ] ) and ( [ gttcomponent2 ] ) are performed introducing some perturbation approximation due to the fact that the quantum stress tensor @xmath40 is linear in the dirac constant @xmath41 ( that in our chosen units is @xmath42 ) . in this sense , we are following the idea mentioned in the introduction , consistent in considering the right hand side of the semiclassical einstein equations as a perturbation , since may be , therefore , the only one way to obtain the approximate physical solution to the backreaction problem .",
    "we use as a perturbation parameter the ratio @xmath43 , where @xmath28 is the mass of the black hole ( in conventional units we have @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the planck s mass ) . now inserting in ( [ grrcomponent ] ) and ( [ gttcomponent2 ] )",
    "the general expressions for the quantum stress tensor evaluated in the classical reissner - nordstrm metric and considering only terms that are linear in the perturbation parameter we can obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 up to @xmath48 .",
    "after some algebra we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51    for the function @xmath52 in ( [ gttcomponent1 ] ) defined by ( [ gttcomponent2 ] ) we obtain @xmath53 with the above analytical results for the semiclassical line element representing a quantum corrected charged black hole , we can determine the changes in some of the properties of the solution , with respect to its classical counterpart .",
    "in particular , we can determine the change in the position of the event horizon due to quantum effects .",
    "let be @xmath54 the position of the event horizon for the classical charged black hole .",
    "the horizon for the quantum corrected solution will be at position @xmath55 defined by @xmath56    solving ( [ horizoneqn ] ) we find that , up to first order in the perturbation parameter , the exact horizon position @xmath55 for the semiclassical charged black hole is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 now using the expressions for the temporal component of the stress - energy tensor of the quantum field , and performing the above integral , we obtain as the final result @xmath59 with @xmath60 @xmath61 it is interesting to note that the effect of the quantum field over the bare black hole spacetime is to reduce the position of the event horizon .",
    "this reduction is a consequence of the typical fact that the weak energy condition for the quantum field is violated on the event horizon .",
    "in this section , we consider the evolution of a test massless scalar field @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , in the background of the semiclassical spherically charged black hole studied above .",
    "the dynamics of for this test field is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath64 with @xmath65 is the metric tensor of semiclassical solution ( [ grrcomponent ] ) to ( [ lambda ] ) , and @xmath66 its determinant .",
    "changing the wave function @xmath67 , and the radial coordinate @xmath68 , and separating the time , radial and angular dependence of the field as @xmath69 , the klein - gordon equation is written as @xmath70z_{l}=0\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the quasinormal frequency and @xmath72 is the effective potential .",

    "the general expression for this magnitude can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82    ( top curve ) and @xmath83(bottom curve ) . @xmath84 and",
    "the mass parameter of the quantum scalar field is chosen to be m=1/10 .",

    "the quasinormal modes are solutions of the wave equation ( [ kg2 ] ) with the specific boundary conditions requiring pure out - going waves at spatial infinity and pure in - coming waves on the event horizon .",
    "thus no waves come from infinity or the event horizon .",
    "the quasinormal frequencies are in general complex numbers , whose real part determines the real oscillation frequency and the imaginary part determines the damping rate of the quasinormal mode . in order to evaluate the quasinormal modes for the test scalar field , we use the well known wkb technique , that can give accurate values of the lowest ( that is longer lived ) quasinormal frequencies .",
    "the first order wkb technique was applied to finding quasinormal modes for the first time by shutz and will @xcite .",
    "latter this approach was extended to the third order beyond the eikonal approximation by iyer and will @xcite and to the sixth order by konoplya @xcite .",
    "we use in our numerical calculation of quasinormal modes this sixth order wkb expansion , for which was shown in @xcite that gives a relative error which is about two order less than the third wkb order .",
    "the sixth order wkb formula can be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the value of the potential at its maximum as a function of the tortoise coordinate , and @xmath87 represents the second derivative of the potential with respect to the tortoise coordinate at its peak .",
    "the correction terms @xmath88 depend on the value of the effective potential and its derivatives ( up to the 2i - th order ) in the maximum ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the above formula was used in several papers for the determination of quasinormal frequencies in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "yet one should remember that strictly speaking the wkb series converge only asymptotically and the consequence decreasing of the relative error in each wkb order is not guaranteed .",
    "fortunately , in the considered case here , wkb series shown convergence in all sixth orders .    in the following",
    "we show the results for the numerical evaluation of the first two fundamental quasinormal frequencies considering a minimal coupling between the quantum field and the bare black hole . as we can see for the above expressions for the effective potential of the semiclassical black hole , the parameters entering in the determination of the quasinormal frequencies are the black hole bare charge @xmath27 and mass @xmath28 , the coupling constant @xmath4 between the quantum scalar and the classical gravitational fields , and the quantum field mass @xmath3 . in table ( 1 ) we list values for the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal frequencies for semiclassical and classical black holes varying the multipolar number @xmath73 and the overtone number @xmath89 .",
    "the numerical results are obtained for minimal coupling between the quantum field and the background gravity field , fixing the bare black hole charge to mass ratio , and allowing to variation in @xmath28 .",

    "such an influence appears essentially as an appreciable shift in the quasinormal frequencies that decreases as the bare black hole mass increases , and that not have a strong dependance upon the quantum field parameters .",
    "this shift shows that the quantum corrected quasinormal modes are less oscillatory with respect to its classical counterpart .",
    "the new features mentioned above regarding the quasinormal frequencies of the semiclassical solution so far reflect the physics of the back reaction of a single specie of a field of spin @xmath106 .",
