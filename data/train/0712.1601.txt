    "circumstellar disks are a common , if not universal , part of the star formation process .",
    "the dust and gas within them provide the building blocks for planetary systems , hence their study is of critical importance for understanding planet formation processes and timescales .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done in the past 20 years to inventory circumstellar disks in star forming regions and young stellar clusters , constraining their properties and lifetimes as a function of stellar age , mass , and environment .",
    "the advent of the spitzer space telescope , with its unprecedented mid - infrared sensitivity , has opened up the field in this regard and is now providing the most complete census of disks to date .    in young clusters the disk fraction is a strong function of age , decreasing from @xmath2 for clusters at 1 myr down to almost no stars with disks for clusters older than 10 myr @xcite .",
    "however , large variations in the disk properties exist at any age",
    ". observations of the infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which traces dust emission from the disk within a few au of the star , show a wide range of excess for single clusters @xcite as well as a decrease in the median excess with age @xcite .",
    "submillimeter observations @xcite and spectra of the 10  silicate feature @xcite also show a large variation in the dusts properties between circumstellar disks .",
    "the exact nature of this evolution , and why some stars lose their disks before others , has not been completely solved .",
    "strong dependences on the steller mass have been found , particularly at ages @xmath32 - 3 myr , where less massive stars tend to hold onto their disks longer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the role of environment is less clear ; while some disks are clearly destroyed more quickly in strong photoionizing environment , there is some evidence that the overall disk frequency changes little @xcite .",
    "much of the recent spitzer studies concerning disk evolution have focused on somewhat older regions with ages @xmath32 myr @xcite . in order to investigate earlier disk evolution , we present here an analysis of the stellar population of a young embedded cluster associated with the ngc 2068 and 2071 reflection nebulae ( hereafter treated as one region ngc 2068/71 ) .",
    "as a site of ongoing star - formation with hundreds of young stellar objects , this region provide a unique environment to study early disk evolution . as part of the much larger orion",
    "b molecular cloud , they are located at a distance of approximately 400 pc @xcite .",
    "the large number of sources with infrared excess indicate it is still a very young cluster .",
    "studies of dense gas @xcite and dust continuum @xcite reveal a large number of dense molecular clumps and cores , consistent with the youthful nature of this region .",
    "we have analyzed optical spectra along with optical , near and mid - infrared photometry to identify members of the ngc 2068/71 cluster and study the stellar and circumstellar properties of these members .",
    "section  [ data ] describes the data we have obtained , section  [ results ] describes our results derived from these data , and section  [ discussion ] includes a discussion of the implications of these results .",
    "low - resolution optical spectra were taken with the hectospec instrument on the mmt .",
    "hectospec is a fiber - fed multi - object spectrograph that uses 300 fibers to cover a 1@xmath4 field of view @xcite .",
    "these spectra have a resolution of r=1200 and cover the wavelength range 3700 - 9150 .",
    "they were obtained on nov 5,2004 and oct 23,2005 with an exposure time of 3x900 sec .",
    "our sample selection methodology will be discussed below .",
    "high - resolution optical spectra were taken with the hectochelle instrument on the mmt .",
    "hectochelle uses 240 of hectospec s 300 fibers to cover a similar field of view at much higher resolution @xcite .",
    "spectra were centered on the h@xmath1  line at 6563@xmath5 covering a wavelength range of 6460 - 6648  with a resolution of r=32,000 .",
    "two fields , each with an exposure time of 3x1200 sec , were observed on dec 3,2004 and nov 14,2005 .",
    "five stars ( # 177 , 326 , 458 , 618 and 1116 ) were included in both high - resolution observing runs in order to examine the variability in the h@xmath1  profile of these objects .",
    "near - infrared @xmath6 photometry was taken from the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "mid - infrared photometry was obtained using the irac and mips cameras aboard the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the irac observations were taken as part of gto program 29 , irac survey of the orion molecular clouds .",
    "irac images were taken in high - dynamic range ( hdr ) mode with exposures of 10.4 and 0.4 seconds @xcite .",
    "individual bcd frames ( pipeline version s9.5.0 ) were mosaicked using a custom idl program creating separate mosaics from the short exposures and the long exposures .",
    "source selection on these mosaics was completed using photvis v1.08 @xcite .",
    "photometry was derived from individual bcd frames using the highest signal to noise data that did not have any saturated pixels ( megeath et al . in prep ) .",
    "the photometry used an aperture of 2.4  , and a sky annulus with inner and outer radii of 2.4  and 7.2  .",
    "magnitude zero points of 21.93 , 21.26 , 19.08 , 19.44 , including the aperture correction , were used for these data .",
    "the mips observations were taken in scan mode using medium scan rate and half - array offsets , with a total areal coverage of about 40x45 common to the three arrays .",
    "the total effective exposure times are 80 , 40 , and 8 seconds at 24 , 70 , and 160 microns .",
    "since only a few class ii sources were detected at 70 microns and none at 160 , we have omitted those data in this study .",
    "the images were reduced using the mips instrument team data analysis tool , which includes basic calibration as well as mosaicking of individual exposures @xcite .",
    "the final mosaic was created with half - pixel subsampling .",
    "we then performed photometry on individual point sources in the 24 micron mosaic using psf fitting with an emipirical psf constructed from bright isolated point sources in the field .",
    "a psf fit radius of 5.6 `` and sky annulus of 15 - 22.5 '' were used .",
    "an aperture correction of 1.73 , as estimated from the stiny tim psf model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was applied to the raw photometry .",
    "fluxes were converted to absolute units using a conversion factor of 150 dn / s / mjy .",
    "optical photometry was taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the orion field was observed as part of an early calibration run through the galactic plane in the fall of 1998 and the fall of 1999 @xcite .",
    "sdss photometry includes measurements at _ ugriz _ , whose effective wavelengths are 3540 , 4760 , 6290 , 7690 , 9250 .",
    "in total we have photometry extending from 0.35 - 24  over a field roughly @xmath7 centered on the ngc 2068 and 2071 nebulae .",
    "the mips field is slightly smaller , which only affects a few of our selected cluster members .",
    "table  [ member_phot ] lists the photometry for the cluster members and figure  [ poss_image ] shows our cluster members overlayed on an optical image of the cluster .",
    "targets for the spectroscopic survey were chosen based on their position on the r vs. r - i color magnitude plot above the expected position of the main sequence at the distance of ngc 2068/71 , as seen in figure  [ sdss_cmd ] .",
    "we restricted ourselves to stars with r magnitude between 13 and 18.5 to exclude stars that would saturate and those that are too faint to be easily observed .",
    "the faint limit corresponds to an unextincted 2 myr old m6 star at 400pc . of these stars many are foreground / background stars unrelated to the cluster .",
    "the cluster members were identified from the presence of lithium ( 6707  ) absorption and h@xmath1  emission in the low - resolution spectra . since h@xmath1  emission can be seen in older stars , such as dme stars , we use strong li absorption as the primary indicator of youth , while h@xmath1  and other emission lines are used as a secondary indicator .",
    "lithium absorption is an accurate indicator of youth in low - mass stars , but is more ambiguous for g type stars and earlier ; with smaller convective envelopes these stars do not burn the li in their atmospheres as quickly and li absorption can be observed in older stars . along with our flux limit , this focuses our survey to low mass stars of spectral type k to mid m. we do not attempt to characterize the high mass or brown dwarf population of young stars within ngc 2068/71 .",
    "our survey is also limited by extinction . since we define our members based on optical spectra , we can not survey the deeply embedded population .",
    "figure  [ nir_cmd ] shows a j vs. j - h color - magnitude diagram , similar to figure  [ sdss_cmd ] , with a reddening vector extending from a 3 myr old m0 star at 400 pc .",
    "our sample is limited to @xmath8 although many sources further along the reddening vector have excess emission at 3.6 - 24  consistent with circumstellar disks and hence are probably embedded cluster members . a j - h vs. h - k color - color diagram for the cluster members",
    "is shown in figure  [ nir_ccd ] .",
    "the cluster members without a near - infrared excess fall within @xmath9 of the main sequence locus due to extinction limit imposed by the use of optical spectra .",
    "table  [ lowres ] lists the stars identified as likely cluster members along with their spectral types and li and h@xmath1  equivalent widths .",
    "of the 453 stars observed spectroscopically , 69 are likely members .",
    "they are a mix of classical and weak t - tauri stars ( ctts , wtts respectively ) and range in spectral type from g6-m6 .",
    "two are continuum stars that do not show any significant features that could be used to derive a spectral type .",
    "they are added as members , but are not included in the rest of our analysis .",
    "ctts and wtts are separated based on their h@xmath1  equivalent width , using the h@xmath1  ew versus spectral type boundary from @xcite .",
    "resolved h@xmath1  profiles are needed to best discriminant between accretors and non - accretors , as will be discussed later .      to construct an hr diagram and estimate an age for ngc 2068/71 , the luminosity and effective temperature are derived for each star .",
    "the effective temperature is derived from the strength of multiple absorption bands and lines within the low - resolution spectra , based on the prescription of @xcite with a few modifications . in the prescription of @xcite the spectra",
    "are split into broad categories of early ( @xmath10k1 ) , medium ( k1-m0 ) and late ( m0-m6 ) spectral types , and separate bands / lines are used within each broad category to derive an effective temperature .",
    "indices were formed for these bands based on the ratio of flux in the feature to flux in the continuum .",
    "we did not use the tio2 ( 4975 ) band for the medium spectral types or the tio1 ( 4775 ) band for late spectral types because they produced @xmath11 that were inconsistent with the other bands .",
    "the spurious temperature from the tio1 band could be caused by low signal to noise in the later spectral types or veiling from accretion shocks , while the spurious temperature from the tio2 band could be caused by h@xmath12 emission in the continuum interval next to the feature .",
    "the tio3 ( 6185 ) and tio4 ( 7140 ) bands are best used for stars with tio1 index @xmath13 and tio2 index @xmath14 indicative of later spectral types , but we used them whenever possible because of their tight correlation between band strength and @xmath11 . when multiple bands were used to determine the @xmath11 of the star",
    "the spread in @xmath11 was used to estimate the uncertainty in spectral type .",
    "spectral types of the members were visually confirmed by comparing to the standard spectra of @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of m stars were also double - checked with the caii and cah spectral bands of @xcite , as well as the vo bands of @xcite .",
    "effective temperatures were transformed to spectral types using the conversion of @xcite .",
    "veiling can sytematically effect our spectral typing since it will reduce the band strengths , resulting in an earlier spectral type .",
    "we can estimate the effect of veiling for those star where measurements of the veiling exist ( see section  [ sec_accrete ] ) . since veiling is roughly constant redward of 5000  @xcite our measurements of the veiling at 6500  should be equal to the veiling at the bands that are used to measure spectral type . for these stars",
    "the effect of veiling is on the order of the spectral type uncertainty .",
    "overall we do not account for veiling when deriving spectral type , but we do not expect it to substantially change our results .",
    "the luminosity of each star was calculated from its optical photometry , transformed from sdss ugriz magnitudes to johnsons - cousins ubvri magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the extinction was derived using the observed r - i color along with the intrinsic r - i color from @xcite and the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "we chose the extinction law of @xcite because it forms the basis for more detailed extinction law studies @xcite .",
    "it also is comparable to recent determinations of the extinction law in the 2mass passbands @xcite allowing us to use it when deriving reddening from r - i colors and from jhk colors ( discussed below ) .",
    "the luminosity was then determined from the dereddened i band using bolometric corrections from @xcite and a distance of 400 pc .",
    "two objects , # 984 and 458 , have no optical photometry and no optical luminosity is calculated .",
    "table  [ member_params ] lists the luminosities , effective temperatures and radii , derived assuming l=@xmath15 .",
    "the typical uncertainty in effective temperature is 5% , while the typical uncertainty in luminosity , which includes uncertainty in @xmath11 and photometric uncertainty , is 10% .",
    "the luminosity can also be derived from the 2mass j band magnitude . to determine the amount of extinction for each star , the observed j - h color was dereddened to the intrinsic j - h color , taken from @xcite , for the wtts while the ctts were dereddened to the ctts locus from @xcite .",
    "bolometric corrections from @xcite were used and a distance of 400 pc was assumed .",
    "there is no systematic difference between the extinction or luminosity derived from the optical colors or the near - infrared colors . for three stars where dereddening based on r - i colors resulted in negative extinction ,",
    "i.e. the observed colors are bluer than the intrinsic colors , the extinction was instead derived from the near - infrared .",
    "two of these stars have late spectral types ( m5-m6 ) for which a different choice of intrinsic colors ( e.g. @xcite ) would result in positive extinction . for these stars",
    "the extinction is close to zero and a change in the intrinsic colors will have a significant effect on the reddening derived .",
    "object 1171 is much brighter in the optical than in the near - infrared , possibily due to variability , and the extinction and luminosity are both derived from the near - infrared . for objects # 984 and 458",
    "the extinction and luminosity were derived from the near - infrared photometry because of the lack of optical photometry .",
    "object 458 appears extended in the 2mass images giving it anamolous colors as seen in figure  [ nir_ccd ] , and its extinction is assumed to be zero even though it is likely to be much higher . since the extinction is most likely non - zero the luminosity we derive is a lower limit . for the rest of the stars we use the optically derived luminosities for our analysis .",
    "figure  [ hr ] shows the hr diagram for ngc 2068/71 along with theoretical isochrones from @xcite .",
    "the members are spread from above the 1 myr isochrone to below the 10 myr isochrone , a spread beyond our errors in luminosity and temperature and typically seen in hr diagrams of similar regions @xcite .",
    "there appears to be no significant age difference between the ctts or wtts .",
    "the median age for the cluster is 2 myr , with the majority of the stars lying between the 1 and 3 myr isochrones .",
    "using optical spectroscopy limits our study to the stars that are not heavily embedded within the molecular cloud .",
    "our measured age of 2 myr may be an overestimate of the true mean age if the substantial population of embedded stars is systematically younger . without any information about their luminosities or @xmath11 we use an age of 2 myr for the rest of our analysis .",
    "when studying the age and masses of the stars in ngc 2068/71 we have chosen to use the theoretical isochrones of @xcite .",
    "other isochrones , such as those by @xcite and @xcite would result in a different estimate for the age of the cluster and the masses of indivual stars .",
    "the dantona & mazzitelli tracks tend to produce younger ages , with most of the ngc 2068/71 members lying above the 1 myr isochrone . the baraffe et al .",
    "models agree more accurately with dynamical mass estimates of binaries , with large scatter , @xcite although the models do not extend to our most massive members .",
    "the siess et al .",
    "tracks measure sytematically low masses , similar to the dantona & mazzitelli tracks , although the tracks do follow the locus of cluster members in the hr diagram .",
    "we do not account for these systematic effects but only note that the age of the cluster and the masses of individual stars is model dependent .",
    "contamination from the nearby older , 4 - 6 myr , ob1b association might affect our estimate of the age of ngc 2068/71 . without proper motion",
    "it is difficult to distinguish members of ngc 2068/71 from members of ob1b that have strayed into our field of view .",
    "we can estimate the contamination by considering the radial distribution of orion ob1b members from @xcite .",
    "based on the size of our ngc 2068/71 field and distance from the center of the ob1b association we expect roughly one star from the ob1b association to fall within our field .",
    "this will not substantially affect our estimate of the age of the cluster , or our study of the disk population .",
    "the mass of each star was derived based on its position in the hr diagram by interpolating along a theoretical isochrone between the nearest model masses using effective temperature .",
    "this was done for the isochrone above and below each member , and the two mass estimates were averaged .",
    "isochrones at 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 10 , and 20 myr were used while stars above the 1 myr isochrone were assumed to lie on the 1 myr isochrone and stars below the 20 myr isochrone were assumed to lie on the 20 myr isochrone .",
    "there is little difference in the mass estimate when using the two isochrones because many of these stars are young enough to still lie on vertical convective tracks . for those higher mass stars that lie on older isochrones",
    "there is more uncertainty in the mass estimate because this position in the hr diagram corresponds to an evolution along constant luminosity rather than constant @xmath11 . for these stars , typically with m@xmath16 , we interpolated along each isochrone using luminosity instead of @xmath11 . since most of our stars are k to mid - m this only applied to the handful of stars with the earliest spectral types",
    "the typical uncertainty in the mass estimates is 10% , based on the uncertainty in effective temperature , ignoring systematic uncertainties in the theoretical models .",
    "masses are listed in table  [ member_params ] .",
    "radial velocities were derived for those stars with high - resolution spectra using the cross - correlation program _",
    "fxcor _ in iraf , along with 3 late g , early k type standard stars .",
    "@xcite describe in detail the methodology used to derive radial and rotational velocities .",
    "our results are given in table  [ highres ] .",
    "two objects ( # 584,373 ) do not have any spectral lines above the noise that can be used to measured an accurate radial velocity , and no radial velocity is recorded .",
    "the distribution of radial velocities for all members is shown in figure  [ vr ] , along with just the ctts , which show a similar distribution .",
    "a gaussian fit to the radial velocities of the members has a center at 27.1 km / sec and a standard deviation of 1.3 km / sec , which is similar to the uncertainties in the radial velocities .",
    "a similar spread is measured in the radial velocities of taurus and onc members @xcite .",
    "the radial motion of the members is consistent with the motion of the surrounding molecular cloud @xcite . given the youth of the members , they have not had much time to travel outside of the cloud in which they were born .",
    "if we assume the velocity spread represents the difference between stellar and cloud velocities , it would take 5 myr to travel 5 pc , roughly the size of the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "rotational velocities were derived from the width of the cross - correlation function determined by the program _ fxcor_. the relationship between the width of the cross - correlation function and the rotational velocity is determined by artificially broadening spectral standards , which all have a rotational velocity below the resolution limit of 8 km / sec .",
    "a quadratic function was fit to the width versus vsini , and the average of these fits for the three spectral standards was used to convert the width of the correlation function for the object spectra to vsini values .",
    "the h@xmath1  line was excluded when measuring the rotational velocity since it is not broadened by rotation alone .",
    "rotational velocities , listed in table  [ highres ] , are plotted as a function of break - up velocity ( @xmath17 ) in figure  [ vsini ] .",
    "most of the members have vsini below the resolution limit of 8 km / sec and almost all have a rotational velocity which is a small fraction of the break - up velocity .",
    "the two stars with the highest fractional rotational velocity have noisy continua , which could lead to a spuriously high rotational velocity .",
    "the rotation rates are consistent with the small vsini seen in other regions of similar ages @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1  line is a sensitive measure of accretion activity . for our sample",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath1  line , measured from the low - resolution spectra and listed in table  [ lowres ] , was used to differentiate between actively accreting stars ( ctts ) and stars that are not actively accreting ( wtts ) .",
    "we have used the ew boundary as a function of spectral type between ctts and wtts defined by @xcite .",
    "self - absorption generally does not affect the ew .",
    "when the absorption is the strongest , the emission is also very strong because the accretion and mass loss that the two components trace are related to each other . with this in mind",
    "resolved h@xmath1  profiles are still the preferred accretion diagnostic .",
    "high - resolution hectochelle spectra , examples of which are shown in figure  [ spec_ex ] , were available for 34/67 of our likely members , as well as our two continuum stars . for these stars the h@xmath1  profile was used to delineate active accretors from non - accretors instead of the h@xmath1  ew . a full width at 10% maximum flux of 250 km / sec was used to separate accretors and non - accretors . measuring the width at 10% maximum flux rather than half",
    "maximum helps to avoid any self - absorption features in the profile while still measuring the profile above the noise of the continuum . @xcite",
    "use a boundary of 270 km / sec , while we choose 250 km / sec to consistently include veiled stars as actively accreting , see below and figure  [ hafw ] .",
    "four exceptions ( # 1262 , 326 , 994 , 998 ) out of the 35 members with high - resolution spectra show signs of accretion although their high - resolution h@xmath1  ew lies below the ctts boundary .",
    "object 1262 ( h@xmath1  ew=8 fw 10% = 340 km / sec ) has a very large absorption dip in the center of the h@xmath1  profile , reducing the flux in the line , and the measured ew , while object 326 ( h@xmath1ew=5.9 , fw 10%=170 km / sec ) has an inverse p cygni profile .",
    "the presence of a strong absorption feature , such as the inverse p cygni profiles in objects 326 and 515 in figure  [ spec_ex ] , can lower the velocity width below our threshold of 250 km / sec . in these cases",
    "the presence of strong absorption features due to accretion flows , as well as an asymmetric profile , indicate that accretion is still ongoing .",
    "object 984 has a very noisy high - resolution spectra , possibly due to its high reddening , @xmath18 , making it difficult to evaluate its accretion status .",
    "object 998 also has a noisy profile and the high - resolution spectra of these two stars was binned to increase the signal to noise .",
    "the width of the h@xmath1  profile is above our threshold for active accretion ; however the accretion status of these stars is still questionable without a higher signal to noise h@xmath1  profile , or another sign of active accretion such as a u band excess .",
    "unfortunately the red leak in the sdss u - band prevents us from accuratly measuring the u - band excess in this filter .",
    "the h@xmath1  ews measured from the high - resolution spectra , listed in table  [ highres ] , are consistent with the h@xmath1  ew measured from the low - resolution spectra .",
    "continuum veiling of the photospheric absorption features provides an additional measure of accretion activity , albeit one that is less sensitive than the h@xmath1  profile .",
    "accretion shocks produce a featureless continuum that adds to the photosphere , reducing the strength of photospheric lines relative to the observed continuum .",
    "the change in these photospheric features can be measured by comparing a veiled spectra with an unveiled spectra of the same spectral type .",
    "the method of @xcite was used to calculate the veiling ( @xmath19 ) over the wavelength range 6490 - 6501 .",
    "this wavelength range was chosen because it contains a number of strong stellar lines while other wavelength ranges in our high - resolution spectra did not consistently have strong lines useful for veiling and were ignored .",
    "we added a constant flux to the unveiled spectra until the strength of the photospheric features relative to the continuum matches that of the veiled spectra .",
    "this constant flux level relative to the continuum is designated r. the uncertainty in the veiling is approximately 0.15 , and was estimated by comparing standards of similar spectral types to each other .",
    "standards of spectral type k1.5,k2.5,k7,m0,m1 were used and veiled spectra were compared to standards within one spectral type . for the veiled stars that have a measurable rotational velocity , the standard was artificially broadened to match the rotational velocity of the veiled star .",
    "we found veiling measures ranging from 0.31 to 3.2 , similar to those found near 6500  by @xcite .",
    "accretion rates were estimated from the veiling measures using the procedure of @xcite .",
    "the conversion starts by using the r band magnitude as a measure of the continuum emission in this wavelength range , then from the definition of @xmath20 we determine the excess flux , converting to an accretion luminosity by assuming the total accretion flux was 11 times larger than the flux observed over the r band and then assuming the accretion infall comes from @xmath21 to convert accretion luminosity to accretion rate . correcting the observed accretion flux for the total accretion flux",
    "depends on the model of the accretion shock chosen .",
    "we use a correction factor of 11 , a logarithmic average of various models , which is consistent with the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath21 is typical for the truncation of the disk by the magnetosphere , where material from the disk flows onto the magnetic field lines @xcite . instead of using theoretical r band magnitudes ,",
    "we used observed r band magnitudes , correcting for the contribution from the veiling and extinction .",
    "this avoids the assumption that all of the stars have exactly the same age , and is not subject to the systematic uncertainties associated with theoretical isochrones . for those stars with no measurable veiling but signs of accretion , such as a wide and/or asymmetric h@xmath1  profile , an upper limit on the accretion rate was calculated assuming a veiling of r=0.15 .",
    "accretion rates are listed in table  [ highres ] and veiling , excess flux from accretion in the r band , accretion luminosity and accretion rate are plotted in figure  [ accrete ] as a function of mass .",
    "the @xmath22 values are typical of the range in young regions such as taurus @xcite .",
    "we do not cover a large enough range in mass to look for any statistically significant trends .",
    "five of our likely members , objects 326 , 177 , 458 , 618 and 1116 have two high - resolution spectra taken a year apart .",
    "object 618 has the largest variation with both a change in the shape and strength of the profile , even though the width of the profile does not significantly change , as seen in figure  [ spec_ex ] .",
    "the other stars do not vary significantly in the shape or strength of the h@xmath1  profile .",
    "the 10% fw vary by less than 40 km / sec for all of these stars , similar to other stars with similar h@xmath1  profiles @xcite .",
    "accretion is often associated with outflows and jets driving material away from the star @xcite .",

    "there appears to be no significant separation , although the substantial number of upper limits makes it difficult to evaluate any difference fully .",
    "it has been suggested that the slow rotation rates for pre - main sequence stars are due to disk - locking , where the star is connected to the disk by its magnetic field lines and angular momentum is transferred from the star to the disk .",
    "@xcite suggest that even if the slow rotation speed was due to disk locking , a significant difference between the rotation velocity of stars with disks and stars without disks would be difficult to measure .",
    "more data are needed to test these hypotheses in detail with the members of this region .",

    "this is especially important when examining the accretion activity of the evolved disks which tend to have low h@xmath1  ew although they are still accreting ( see figure  [ hafw ] ) .",
    "the location of our selected members does not strictly overlap with either the dense gas emission @xcite or the dense dust emission @xcite .",
    "star formation is ongoing in these regions of dense gas and dust , based on observable outflows and class i sources . to compare the distribution of members to the dust cloud we created an extinction map ( figure  [ extmap ] ) by selecting background stars , assuming they have the same intrinsic h - k@xmath56 color , and calculating @xmath57 .",
    "a 30  gaussian kernel was used to smooth the map and the extinction law of @xcite was used to convert from e(h - k@xmath56 ) to @xmath58 .",
    "a more detailed description of this method is given in @xcite .",
    "the extinction map closely matches the cs emission measured by @xcite .",
    "it also agrees with the lower resolution extinction map of @xcite , although their map does show a more extended peak at @xmath59 , @xmath60 which could be due to our small number of background stars in this area .",
    "as seen in figure  [ extmap ] , our selected members follow the general shape of the diffuse dust traced by the extinction map , but are not confined to the peaks of the dust , where the scuba clumps @xcite and class i sources ( muzerolle et al . in prep ) are located",
    ". our sample may be biased toward those areas of lower extinction away from the dense gas and dust because the use of optical spectra for spectral type classification limits our survey to those young stars that are not deeply embedded within the cloud .",
    "another possibility is that the star formation in this region has progressed from west to east .",
    "stellar winds and photoionizing flux from the ob associations to the west of ngc 2068/71 may have been interacting with the cloud , causing stars to form on the western side of the cloud first and on the eastern side of the cloud later .",
    "a third possibility is that the selected members may have had time to disperse from their original birthplace and have spread throughout the cloud . for a typical velocity of 1 - 2 km / sec relative to the cloud",
    ", these members could have traveled 2 - 4 pc in their lifetime of  2 myr , roughly the east - west extent of the members .",
    "binarity may have a significant impact on disk properties , however , our data lack the spatial resolution to address this .",
    "one star ( object # 739 ) was observed to be a binary by @xcite .",
    "this binary has a separation of 0.97  , which corresponds to 390 au at a distance of 400pc .",
    "interestingly this star has a mips - weak disk , which might be explained by tidal truncation of the outer disk .",
    "@xcite estimate a binary fraction of 15% , which would imply that 10 of our sources are binaries .",
    "none of our stars with high - resolution spectra appear to be spectroscopic binaries but more epochs are needed to rule out single - line spectroscopic binaries .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for the seds of strong disks vs. mips - weak / irac - weak disks .",
    "grain growth and settling is one process that may have a measurable effect on the sed of an accretion disk .",
    "models suggest that this can be a very fast process producing noticeable differences in the sed in less than a million years @xcite .",
    "the overall effect is to quickly deplete grains out of the upper layers of the disk , while grains in the inner disk will grow and settle more quickly than in the outer disk .    as the degree of settling increases",
    ", the most direct effect is a decrease in the irradiation surface of the disk , which leads to less emerging flux .",
    "the sed approaches that of a perfectly flat disk , @xmath32 at wavelengths corresponding to the disk radii that are affected by settling @xcite . assuming the amount of grain growth and settling is constant throughout the disk , the change in flux is most noticeable for @xmath61 because these wavelengths trace regions in the disk where flaring becomes prominent and the surface height is most sensitive to grain growth and settling .",
    "the emission at @xmath62 is dominated by the wall at the dust destruction radius , which is less affected by the degree of flaring of the disk . for a substantial amount of grain growth and settling",
    "the height of the wall will decrease by a factor of 2 , while the height of the outer disk can decrease by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "theory predicts grain growth and settling should occur more rapidly in the inner disk than the outer disk since the orbital period is shorter @xcite .",
    "the irac - weak stars may have a substantial amount of grain growth and settling in the inner disk , whereas the mips - weak sources may have advanced settling over a wider range of radii .",
    "the predicted seds for grain growth and settling are not unlike those corresponding to a decrease in the accretion rate",
    ". a lowered accretion rate will affect the disk in three ways : ( 1 ) decrease the surface density , ( 2 ) decrease the viscous heating and ( 3 ) decrease the accretion luminosity emitted by the stellar accretion shock .",
    "a decrease in surface density will lower the flux at all wavelengths , while the smaller viscous heating will lead to a cooler midplane temperature and a change in the scale height of the disk similar to that of grain growth and settling .",
    "the decrease in the accretion luminosity will have an effect on the inner disk edge which dominates the flux at @xmath62 .",
    "accretion luminosity , along with stellar irradiation , illuminates the inner dust edge of the disk .",
    "a decrease in accretion luminosity will cause the dust destruction radius to move closer to the star . while the inner edge will still be at 1500k , its solid angle will decrease and the emission from the inner edge will decrease . for @xmath63@xmath47",
    "the accretion luminosity is comparable to the stellar luminosity and a change in accretion rate leads to a change in the radius of the wall , and a change in the flux in the irac bands . since the accretion luminosity ( @xmath64 ) and the stellar luminosity roughly scale with stellar mass , the dependence on accretion rate dominates the ratio of accretion to stellar luminosity . for @xmath65@xmath47",
    "the change in the radius of the wall with accretion rate is smaller because the stellar luminosity dominates .",
    "a change in the sed slope could be due to grain growth and settling or a decreased accretion rate separately or it could be caused by a combination of the two . as the amount of settling increases the effect of a change in the accretion rate becomes more significant @xcite . for high accretion rates ,",
    "viscous heating dominates over other forms of heating in the surface layers .",
    "since viscous heating has little dependence on the grains in these layers , there is little change in the sed when grains start to grow . for lower accretion rates",
    ", stellar irradiation dominates the heating of the surface layers , and this form of heating is very sensitive to the grain distribution .",
    "the mips - weak and irac - weak sources may be separating themselves from the strong disks because their low accretion rates lead to a more significant difference in the sed .",
    "however , we need more estimates of @xmath22 to directly compare to disk models .",
    "this picture is confused by the @xmath66 silicate feature which overlaps with the @xmath67 band of irac .",
    "a strong silicate emission feature will artificially increase @xmath23  despite a steeper continuum slope .",
    "as the accretion rate decreases the intensity of this feature increases due to the contrast in temperature between the surface ( heated by stellar irradiation ) and the midplane ( heated by viscous dissipation and emission from the upper layers ) @xcite .",
    "the silicate feature is most sensitive to grain growth in the upper layers of the disk and does not trace grain growth in the midplane .",
    "spectroscopy of the @xmath66 silicate feature would help to break the degeneracy between grain growth and settling and a change in accretion rate @xcite , as well as seperate out its contibution to @xmath23 .",
    "another possibility for the observed seds of the mips - weak stars is the truncation of the disk by a close binary .",
    "a close binary will truncate the disk around the primary at 1/2 to 1/3 the semimajor axis of the binary system @xcite .",
    "the majority of the 24  emission comes from within 0.5 - 5 au , depending on the spectral type and degree of settling in the disk @xcite .",
    "a binary companion separated by @xmath01 - 15au would truncate the disk and reduce the 24  emission without affecting the shorter wavelength excess .",
    "the frequency of mips - weak stars in ngc 2068/71 is roughly consistent with the frequency of binaries at separations @xmath01 - 15au @xcite .",
    "the smaller resevoir of material available to accrete onto the central star may lead the accretion rate to decrease earlier than it would for stars with disks that have not been truncated .",
    "the smaller disks imply a smaller viscous timescale for the evolution of the disk , which may lead it to be quickly dissipated unless it is ressuplied by a circumbinary disk .",
    "the binary fraction within a cluster seems to be a function of environment , rather than of age , with low - desnity clusters such as taurus and ophiuchus showing a higher binary fraction than dense clusters such as the trapezium @xcite .",
    "millimeter observations find that disk masses are much lower for binaries separated by 1 - 100 au than single stars or wide binaries , suggesting truncation of the disk @xcite .",
    "if mips - weak disks are due to the presence of a binary then we may expect the mips - weak fraction to be a strong function of environment rather than age .",
    "interestingly one of our mips - weak stars ( # 739 ) is a known binary @xcite , although its separation ( 390au ) is likely to be too large for any truncation of the disk to affect the 24  flux .",
    "the third group of evolved disks are the transition disks , with au - scale optically thin or evacuated holes in the center of the disks .",
    "we have two such objects , # 177 , and 281 , making up 3% of our spectroscopic sample .",
    "one appears to be actively accreting ( # 281 ) while the other is not .",
    "@xcite , who define transition disks as having no excess shortward of 6 , find that half of the transition disks in tr 37 are still actively accreting , based on high - resolution h@xmath1  profiles .",
    "the transition disks around tw hya , gm aur and dm tau are all seen to be accreting @xcite while coku tau/4 is not actively accreting @xcite .",
    "accretion rates of @xmath68@xmath47  have been measured for gm aur , dm tau , and tw hya @xcite , similar to that measured for object # 281 .",
    "a hole could be swept out by a planet , be caused by substantial grain growth in the inner disk or be due to photoevaporation of the disk .",
    "the formation of a planet would cause material outside the planet s orbit to gain orbital angular momentum and be pushed outwards , while material within the planets orbit would lose angular momentum and quickly accrete onto the star @xcite .",
    "the mass of the planet and the disk will affect whether a gap can be created , and how the planet reacts to the material in the outer disk @xcite .",
    "a planet has been invoked to explain the observed inner holes in gm aur @xcite , coku tau/4 @xcite and tw hya @xcite . for object # 281",
    ", the material within the planet s radius may not have completely accreted onto the star , or the planet may be small enough that some gas may be able to stream past it @xcite .",
    "this gas would transport small grains into the gap , creating an optically thin disk , which would not be detectable from photometry alone @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that grains within 10 au have grown to millimeter sizes or larger , while the grains at larger radii have not grown as much .",
    "the growth of grains should proceed on an orbital timescale , which would result in more grain growth in the inner disk than the outer disk @xcite , although this process should not produce a sharp boundary in the dust disk .",
    "any accretion onto the central star may also transport small grains back into this gap .",
    "a third possibility arises from a photoevaporative wind from the disk driven by stellar uv and x - ray photons @xcite .",
    "when the accretion rate is low the wind will counteract the inward flow of material outside of the gravitational radius and will prevent additional gas from being transported into the inner disk . with the inner disk starved for",
    "material any gas will quickly accrete onto the star and disappear producing an inner hole for a short time before the entire disk dissipates .",
    "this process requires very low ( @xmath69@xmath47 ) accretion rates in order for the wind to counteract the inward flow of material due to accretion .",
    "this would rule out the photoevaporative model for object # 281 , but it is still possible for object # 177 .",
    "none of these three groups of evolved disks appear to be systematically older than the rest of the cluster , according to the hr diagram shown in figure  [ hr ] .",
    "although the two transition disks are below the 3 myr isochrone their small number make any statistically significant conclusion impossible .",
    "while the number of sources in each group is small enough that we can not do a detailed study of the ages , we can say that it is unlikely that either the irac - weak , mips - weak or transition disks are systematically older or younger than the other stars in the cluster .",
    "this indicates that the disks around different stars evolve at different rates .",
    "@xcite find that grain growth proceeds much more quickly than the typical age of a t - tauri star and small grains must be replenished in the disk in order to retain a significant ir excess .",
    "if replenishment occurs then the typical grain size in a disk does not reflect the age of the system .",
    "we would then not expect these stars to appear systematically older if the change in sed for the irac - weak and mips - weak disks is due in part to grain growth .",
    "irac - weak disks are observed in cluster regions from taurus at 1 myr @xcite to ngc 2362 at 5 myr @xcite .",
    "the fraction of irac - weak disks depends on the spectral type range under consideration .",
    "@xcite find the fraction of stars with irac - weak disks ranges from 8 - 25% depending on the spectral type .",
    "later spectral types have a larger fraction of irac - weak disks although this trend may be affected by larger photometric uncertainties at later spectral types blurring the boundary between irac - weak and diskless stars @xcite .",
    "we examine the fraction of disked stars that have an irac - weak sed for broad spectral type ranges to look for trends with age . here",
    "we use @xmath23=-1.8 as the boundary for irac - weak stars to be consistent with previous studies .",
    "we consider k0-m1 stars in taurus at 1 myr @xcite , ngc 2068/71 at 2 myr , ic 348 at 2 - 3 myr @xcite , @xmath70 ori at 3 myr @xcite , tr 37 at 4 myr @xcite and ngc 2362 at 5 myr @xcite .",
    "the fractions of disked stars with irac - weak seds are listed in table  [ evolved_fraction ] .",
    "the fractions of cluster members with disks in these clusters decrease from 80%  to @xmath71 with age , but the fractions of disks with irac - weak seds do not show an obvious decrease with age , although the small number statistics for some of these clusters make this trend uncertain .",
    "typical h@xmath1  ew for the irac - weak disks in tr 37 and ic 348 are @xmath72 @xcite , consistent with the irac - weak stars in ngc 2068/71 , and available high - resolution h@xmath1  profiles indicate they are actively accreting .",
    "however @xcite find that the median sed slope for all disks in a given region decreases with age from 1 - 3 myr , which may contribute to the fraction of disks with irac - weak seds if the entire distribution of infrared excess is shifting to a smaller excess .",
    "of the 54 stars with disks detected by mips in tr 37 , 7 have mips - weak disks @xcite , while out of the 38 k0-m4 stars with disks in ic 348 , 3 have mips - weak disks , none of which are earlier than m1 @xcite . in @xmath70 ori , three out of 16 k0-m1 stars with disks detected by mips have mips - weak disks @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity limit at 24  makes any trends with age harder to evaluate although we note that the fraction of disks with mips - weak seds does not significantly decrease with age .",
    "the h@xmath1  ew of the mips - weak stars in tr 37 are between 4 and 47 , with most below 15  @xcite . of the stars with measured accretion rates ,",
    "most are below @xmath73@xmath47  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the properties of mips - weak disks in ngc 2068/71 , although overall accretion rates are lower in tr 37 and the low accretion rates for the mips - weak stars may simply reflect viscous evolution of the disks",
    ".    if disk evolution is not solely dependent on age then it may depend on environment or the initial conditions of the protostar .",
    "material infalling onto the disk from the surrounding cloud could replenish the small grains in the disk as well as maintain the presence of a disk .",
    "the longevity of a disk would then depend on the resevoir of material surrounding the star . during the early stages of star formation material accretes from an envelope onto the disk , and this infall rate",
    "depends on the properties of the envelope .",
    "more material accreting onto the disk will create a more massive disk , which can affect its subsequent evolution @xcite . unfortunately",
    "sub - mm observations are not sensitive to circumstellar disks in ngc 2068/71and can not be used to estimate disk masses for these stars @xcite .",
    "the initial angular momentum of the system may influence the initial size of the disk and how quickly it evolves @xcite as well as affect the possibility of forming a binary , which could enhance the subsequent evolution of the disk .",
    "a nearby o / b star would increase the ionizing flux impinging on the surface of the disk , and possibly increase the speed with which the disk dissipates , although the evolved disks we observe do not appear preferentially close to the b stars in this cluster and with the earliest member being a b2 star the uv flux is not especially strong .",
    "we have studied the young stellar population of ngc 2068/71 and identified 69 members , for 67 of which we have derived spectral type and luminosity .",
    "our cluster members range from g6-m6 with a median age of 2 myr . a large fraction ( 79% ) of these stars have an infrared excess , although this is likely an overestimate of the true disk fraction . of the stars with an infrared excess and a high - resolution h@xmath1  profile , sensitive to low - accretion rates , all but one are actively accreting .",
    "the stellar members are not confined to regions of dense gas and dust , although there is some evidence that the disk fraction is higher in dense ( @xmath74 ) regions .    combining accretion information from the h@xmath1  line with the 3 - 24  infrared sed we find three populations of evolved disks : irac - weak , mips - weak and transition disks .",
    "all of the populations show a change in the shape of the infrared sed as well as a decrease in the accretion activity . for the irac - weak disks this could solely be due to a decrease in the accretion rate ( which affects the structure of the disk ) , substantial grain growth and settling , or a combination of the two .",
    "these two processes could also explain the mips - weak seds , although truncation of the outer disk by a close binary companion is also a viable possibility .",
    "the transition disks could be explained by a giant planet opening a gap in the disk , or a photoevaporative wind evacuating the inner disk .",
    "the latter mechanism requires a very low accretion rate and can be ruled out for the transition disk in our sample that is still accreting .",
    "none of the groups of evolved disks appear systematically older than the rest of the cluster , although the small numbers make any difference harder to evaluate .",
    "initial conditions in the disk and surrounding envelope could influence how quickly disks evolve .",
    "the initial angular momentum or mass of the disk could also have an influence .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with irac , aboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , and is supported by contract # 1255094 for ssc / caltech to the university if arizona . the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ) was made by the california institute of technology with funds from the national science foundation , the national geographic society , the sloan foundation , the samuel oschin foundation , and the eastman kodak corporation .",
