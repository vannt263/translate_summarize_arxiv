    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a crucial ingredient in interpreting extragalactic observations : without constraints , or assumptions , for the imf , observed luminosities can not be converted into estimates of assembled stellar mass . for old galaxies with a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ,",
    "the great majority of output luminosity is contributed by giant - branch and main - sequence stars with mass @xmath51@xmath2 .",
    "however , some 80 per cent of the stellar mass is locked up in cool dwarfs with mass @xmath10.5@xmath2 , which collectively provide less than ten per cent of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the total stellar mass - to - light ratio is hence very sensitive to the form of the imf at low masses .    in the milky way ,",
    "resolved star counts indicate that the imf follows a salpeter - like power law @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 for @xmath9@xmath10@xmath2 , but becomes shallower at lower masses .",
    "this form can be well represented either by a broken power law ( e.g kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) , or by a log - normal distribution ( chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "extensive searches for variation in the imf in different environments within the milky way have not found conclusive evidence for non - universality ( e.g. see the review by bastian , covey & meyer 2010 ) . for extragalactic systems ,",
    "low - mass stars are not directly observable , and the application of a chabrier - like imf to distant galaxies must be regarded with caution until empirically tested .",
    "limits on the contribution of dwarf stars to the mass budget can be inferred from total mass estimates from dynamical modelling ( e.g. bell & de jong 2001 ; cappellari et al .",
    "2012 ) or gravitational lensing ( e.g. treu et al . 2010 ) , but this approach can not unambiguously discriminate dark mass in cool dwarfs ( bottom - heavy imf ) from that in stellar remnants ( top - heavy imf ) or in non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "an alternative method to constrain the mass locked in low - mass stars is to exploit stellar spectral features that depend strongly on surface gravity , and hence distinguish giant from dwarf stars at similar effective temperature . in particular , red - optical and near - infrared spectral features that are strong in m - dwarfs and not present in cool giants ( or vice versa ) can potentially discriminate the low - mass stellar content in unresolved galaxies . the wing ",
    "ford band ( wfb ) of feh at 9915  ( wing & ford 1969 ) and the nai doublet ( 8190 ) were identified as possible giant - to - dwarf star indicators and exploited in early works ( e.g. spinrad & taylor 1971 ; whitford 1977 ; cohen 1978 ; faber & french 1980 ; carter , visvanathan & pickles 1986 ; couture & hardy 1993 ) . some of these papers ( e.g. spinrad & taylor , faber & french , both based on nai ) suggested a substantial fractional contribution of dwarf stars to the integrated light of nearby galaxies , while others ( e.g. whitford , based on the wfb ) inferred a much lower dwarf - to - giant ratio .",
    "similarly , carter et al . reported tension between the two indicators for a sample of 14 galaxies , with nai requiring a larger fraction of dwarf light than the wfb .",
    "the work of the 1970s1990s was hampered by the limitations of spectral synthesis models at that time .",
    "in particular , there were no large empirical infrared stellar libraries covering the full range of spectral types relevant to the problem .",
    "moreover , knowledge of the range of elemental abundance variations in galaxies was not yet well constrained ; nor was the machinery required to account for such variations through synthetic spectral modelling yet developed .",
    "emphasis in the study of the imf from resolved populations shifted somewhat to the caii triplet ( which is strong in giants and weak in dwarfs ) , with cenarro et al .",
    "( 1993 ) concluding that either calcium was underabundant in giant ellipticals or that a dwarf - enriched imf was required .",
    "a new impetus was given to such studies by the publication of the irtf spectral library by rayner , cushing & vacca ( 2009 ) , which finally provided empirical library spectra for cool stars across the red / infrared regime .",
    "building models from these stars to predict the integrated spectra of old populations , and comparing them to observations of eight giant elliptical galaxies , van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) argued that a strongly dwarf - enriched imf was required to account for the strength of the nai and ( to a lesser extend ) the wfb .",
    "their spectra could be fit only by adopting very bottom - heavy imfs , e.g. a power law with exponent @xmath11=3 ( where @xmath6@xmath7@xmath12 ) , in which a majority of the mass is in @xmath130.15@xmath14 stars with @xmath15k .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath16 for the imf favoured by van dokkum & conroy is a factor of 34 times larger than the chabrier - like imf often assumed in extra - galactic contexts .",
    "hence verifying this result , and determining the types of galaxies affected , has wide implications .",
    "conroy & van dokkum ( 2012a , hereafter cvd12a ) have since generalized their spectral synthesis models to make predictions for simple stellar populations ( ssps ) with a range of imfs , ages , metallicities and abundance ratio patterns .",
    "spurred in part by the original van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) result , several groups have recently investigated the behaviour of imf - sensitive indices in larger galaxy samples .",
    "spiniello et al .",
    "( 2012 ) studied the nai doublet in luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with velocity dispersions @xmath0=200335 ) , finding this feature to increase with @xmath0 , requiring an steepening imf or an increase in na / fe enhancement ( or both ) , with increasing galaxy mass .",
    "subsequently , conroy & van dokkum have analysed new high - s / n spectroscopy including the wfb , the nai doublet and the caii triplet , as well as blue / optical features , for a sample of 38 nearby galaxies ( van dokkum & conroy 2012 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012b , the latter cvd12b hereafter ) . in this work , they apply a sophisticated full - spectrum fitting method with many model components to describe abundance variations and possible confounding parameters .",
    "they conclude that dwarf - enrichment increases with velocity dispersion and ( perhaps more strongly ) with [ mg / fe ] , ranging from chabrier - like to heavier - than - salpeter imfs . although all three of the `` classical '' indicators employed in this work seem to support dwarf - enriched imfs in the most massive ellipticals , the details depend on which spectral features are included in the fit . perhaps to compensate for this tension ,",
    "the models require enhancements of na / fe by up to an order of magnitude over the solar ratio .",
    "most recently , ferreras et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used a very large sample of sdss early - type galaxies to confirm the strong increase in nai with velocity dispersion in the @xmath0=100300  range , interpreting the results as a steepening of the imf slope .",
    "( they did not explicitly consider the effects of na / fe variations . )    for all but the most nearby galaxies , the wing ",
    "ford band is redshifted beyond the limits of current `` optical '' ccds , and infrared detectors are required . in this paper",
    "we present new observations of the wing ",
    "ford band for red - sequence galaxies in the coma cluster , using the infrared fibre multi - object spectrograph ( fmos ; kimura et al .",
    "2010 ) at the 8.2 m subaru telescope on mauna kea .",
    "although galaxies at the distance of coma are individually fainter than those studied by conroy & van dokkum ( 2012b ) , we can exploit the dense concentration of galaxies in the cluster , and the multiplex capability of fmos , to observe dozens of galaxies simultaneously . because the coma galaxies have a range of radial velocities due to their motions within the cluster potential , stacking their spectra in the rest - frame",
    "allows rejection of pixels contaminated by oh sky - line residuals and other artefacts fixed in the observed wavelength frame .",
    "our galaxy sample spans a range in velocity dispersion and other properties , derived in previous work from optical spectroscopy ( price et al . 2011 ; smith et al .",
    "2012 ) , so that we can explore possible variations in the imf with galaxy mass and control for element abundance effects .",
    "besides the wfb , our spectral range also includes a cai line which we exploit as an imf indicator for the first time .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "the construction of composite spectra is detailed in section  [ sec : compo ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , starting with the global composite spectrum ( section  [ sec : globalcomp ] ) , the measurement of spectral indices and their comparison to model predictions ( section  [ sec : indices ] ) , and then dividing the sample into four bins in velocity dispersion ( section  [ sec : sigmabin ] ) and mg / fe ratio ( section  [ sec : mgfebin ] ) , to explore the dependence of the imf on mass and star - formation timescale . in section  [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss our results in the context of relevant recent work , and summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "we observed coma cluster galaxies with fmos on the nights 2012 may 67 , using high spectral resolution mode in `` j - short '' configuration .",
    "this setting provides spectral coverage over the range 913011270(corresponding to 892011010  at the average redshift of coma ) , with resolution @xmath17  fwhm , sampled at 1.25  per pixel .",
    "fmos features two separate ( and somewhat different ) spectrographs , irs1 and irs2 , each receiving half of the 400 total fibres . the fibres project to 1.2arcsec in diameter , corresponding to 0.6kpc  at our adopted distance for coma ( 100mpc , i.e. @xmath18mpc@xmath19 ) .",
    "targets were selected from the sample of 362 coma galaxies analysed by smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which spans a range from the most massive ellipticals ( @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 , @xmath23@xmath21@xmath24 , @xmath25 ) down to the dwarf galaxy population ( @xmath20@xmath21@xmath26 , @xmath23@xmath21@xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the smith et al .",
    "sample excludes galaxies with significant ongoing star formation using a cut on h@xmath4 equivalent width .",
    "fmos deploys fibres within a 30-arcmin diameter field of view ; however each fibre can patrol only a small part of the field , so that the ability to pack fibres closely is quite limited . to maximise",
    "the number of galaxies observed , we used four fibre configurations with pointings offset by a few arcminutes and different field rotations ( constrained by the availability of guide stars ) .",
    "most galaxies in the sample were observed in more than one configuration , through different fibres , and in many cases with both spectrographs . in total , 121 galaxies were observed at least once .",
    "however , the faintest galaxies contribute little signal even if stacked . for the analysis in this paper",
    ", we restrict our attention to 92 target galaxies having @xmath0@xmath2950 .",
    "the observations were made in cross - beam - switching mode , in which two fibres are allocated to each target and the telescope nodded ( usually every 900seconds ) to move the galaxies from one fibre to the other between integrations .",
    "this allows the sky background for each target to be determined using the same fibre and detector pixels as for the galaxy light , while also keeping each target within a fibre for all of the integrations ( equivalent to nodding along the slit in single - object spectroscopy ) .",
    "the fibres in each pair are separated by 90 arcsec which is sufficiently large to avoid contamination of the sky by the outer part of the target galaxy for all objects in our sample .",
    "the combined integration times for the four fibre configurations were 2.33 , 1.50 , 2.00 and 2.00 hours , for a total of 7.83 hours total integration .",
    "observing conditions were fairly good , with seeing 0.61.1arcsec and occasional passing cirrus on the second night .",
    "initial data reduction was performed using the standard fmos fibre - pac pipeline ( iwamuro et al .",
    "2012 ) , yielding extracted , calibrated one - dimensional spectra for each fibre . at the redshift of coma ,",
    "the wfb is observable in a region of very clean atmospheric transmission .",
    "typical telluric absorption features in this window are less than 1per cent in amplitude .",
    "the fibre - pac pipeline attempts to correct for atmospheric absorption using stars observed simultaneously with the science targets , but this requires correcting for the intrinsic spectral signatures of those stars , in particular the pa@xmath30 line , lying @xmath5150  short - wards of the redshifted wfb . despite taking particular care to improve the removal of this feature by manually tuning the spectral type assumed for the star",
    ", we were not able to remove these artefacts to our satisfaction .",
    "in practice we opted instead to mask the affected region when stacking the spectra .",
    "the results of this paper are based upon analysis of composite spectra created by stacking the spectra of many galaxies , after masking `` bad '' intervals in observed wavelength and shifting to the rest frame .",
    "because the sample spans a significant range in redshift due to the large virial motions within the cluster ( equivalent to fwhm@xmath580 ) , this process fills the `` gaps '' imposed by residual sky contamination and other artefacts which are fixed in the observed wavelength frame .",
    "fmos features an oh suppression mask to suppress the wavelength regions affected by strong airglow lines .",
    "however , these regions must still be masked in software , since they otherwise appear as low - flux notches within the extracted spectra .",
    "the masks in the two spectrographs are different , with irs1 masking many more weak lines than irs2 . moreover , during reduction of our data , we discovered that the mask in irs2 was misaligned causing masking to occur at wavelengths @xmath560  shortwards from the target sky lines .",
    "we impose software masking at the locations of the oh - suppression notches ( in the case of irs2 , at their actual location , not at the position of the sky lines they were intended to mask , which are adequately subtracted in the reduced spectra ) .",
    "additionally we mask a 20  region centred on ( un - redshifted ) pa@xmath30 , to remove any residuals arising from poor atmospheric absorption corrections . after masking , we correct to the rest frame and re - bin to a common wavelength scale of 960010500 , sampled at 1.25  intervals ( the native sampling of the original spectra ) .",
    "these spectra , of which there are up to four per galaxy , form the input to the compositing procedure .",
    "to combine the spectra , we first apply a simple median over the inputs to obtain an initial estimate for the spectral shape .",
    "each spectrum is then matched to this median using a 4th - order polynomial correction to remove residual throughput variations .",
    "after this we identify and reject outlying pixels ( beyond @xmath315@xmath0 from the average over all input spectra ) , and finally combine surviving pixels using a mean , weighted by the inverse of the variance spectrum .",
    "( for the latter , we use the background noise spectrum estimate from fibre - pac together with a component representing poisson noise in the object spectra . )    errors in the composite spectra were estimated both by using the formal error on the weighted mean , and by computing the composite using 100 bootstrap - resampled realisations of the set of input spectra . the two error",
    "estimates agree to within 5per cent in the region of the wfb and within 20per cent across the whole wavelength range .",
    "however , the rebinning of the spectra onto a common rest - frame wavelength scale inevitably introduces correlations in the errors between adjacent pixels . in our analysis",
    "we will generally make use of the bootstrap realisations of the composite spectrum to propagate the uncertainties appropriately .                in construting the stacked the spectra , we combine galaxies with a range of different velocity dispersions .",
    "broadening all the spectra to the largest velocity width is not appropriate for these data , because it would spread systematic errors ( e.g. from sky - subtraction residuals ) and missing data into most of the pixels in each spectrum . in our subsequent analysis",
    ", we account for the effects of velocity broadening by convolving model spectra to match the weighted mean velocity dispersion of galaxies in the stacks .",
    "we begin by examining qualitatively the spectrum created by stacking the 59 galaxies with @xmath0@xmath29100 . within this sample , the mean velocity dispersion , weighted according to the contribution of each galaxy to the stack , is 180 .",
    "the velocity dispersion range @xmath0=125250  contributes 90 per cent of the total weight . using line - strength indices in the optical range ( 40005500 ) , smith et el .",
    "( 2012 ) derived metallicities and abundance estimates through comparison with the ssp models of schiavon ( 2007 ) .",
    "the average optically - derived parameters , again weighted by contribution to the stacked fmos spectrum are : [ fe / h]=@xmath32 , [ mg / fe]=@xmath33 and ssp - equivalent age 10gyr .",
    "figure  [ fig : compo_fullwav ] shows the composite spectrum over the full spectral range observed .",
    "the total signal - to - noise ratio of this spectrum is @xmath5170 per angstrom .",
    "a visual comparison with the ssp models of cvd12a shows that the observed features correspond closely to the expected absorption signatures of old stellar populations .",
    "we restrict all further analysis to the 960010500  spectral range which includes the imf - sensitive wfb and cai line .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sgcompare ] we divide the same set of input data into two , computing composite spectra for each of the fmos spectrographs separately .",
    "comparison between the irs1 and irs2 composites shows that despite their different characteristics ( in particular the much heavier oh suppression mask in irs1 ) , there is excellent agreement between the average spectra obtained from the two spectrographs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : compo_biggx_imf ] , we compare the observed composite spectrum against ssp models from cvd12a , with old ages ( 13.5gyr ) , solar fe / h and mildly - enhanced @xmath4/fe ratio .",
    "the publicly - available cvd12a models cover either enhanced @xmath4/fe ratio at 13.5gyr or younger ages at solar abundance ratios .",
    "we choose in this figure to match the enhanced @xmath4/fe ratio rather than the slightly younger ages which may be relevant to our sample .",
    "( note that for realistic , non - ssp star - formation histories , the ages derived from optical spectra will be more affected by recent episodes of star formation , while the infrared spectra analysed here will be dominated by the oldest populations . )",
    "each model has been broadened the weighted mean velocity dispersion for the stack , and matched to the overall shape of the observed spectrum using a fourth - order polynomial correction .",
    "the smoothing scale has been verified by a direct @xmath34-fitting of the models to the observed spectrum ; in practice , we prefer to fix this to the average velocity dispersion which is securely measured from optical data .",
    "qualitatively , there is very good agreement between observed and model spectra in regions that are not sensitive to the imf , with all the main spectral features well reproduced .",
    "a systematic discrepancy is seen in the feature at @xmath510050 , which includes the pa@xmath30 line as well as tio absorption , with stronger absorption observed than in the models , causing residuals at the @xmath51 per cent level over a @xmath550  interval .",
    "( a very similar discrepancy is also evident in figure  1 of conroy & van dokkum 2012b . )",
    "more localised 1 per cent discrepancies are also seen at @xmath597009800 .    in the wfb region ,",
    "the bottom of the absorption feature lies close to the models with chabrier or salpeter imf .",
    "however , it should be noted that the spectral region immediately red - wards of the wfb is poorly matched by all models .",
    "hence , inferring the imf through this comparison is somewhat degenerate with the treatment of the continuum matching or , in the case of spectral indices , with the placement of the pseudo - continuum band - passes .",
    "furthermore , the detailed shape of the absorption band itself does not agree well with any of the cvd12a models : the observed spectrum shows a bump at 9920 , while the models at this resolution show a flat - bottomed absorption .",
    "this discrepancy does not seem to arise from a resolution mismatch ; reducing the assumed velocity dispersion to introduce more structure in the wfb results in an unacceptable fit elsewhere in the spectrum , and would be incompatible with the optically - measured @xmath0 .    at 10345",
    "there is another absorption feature which is sensitive to the imf , according to the models .",
    "this feature is marked , as cai , among other possible imf indicators , in figure 10 of cvd12a , but was not pursued further in that paper nor ( to our knowledge ) in any other previous work .",
    "the cai line is in the red wing of a blend , with lines of fei and srii contributing to the blue wing ( identified from the arcturus atlas of hinkle , wallace & livingston 1995 ) . the observed spectrum shows weak absorption at cai , apparently compatible with the chabrier / salpeter imf , and inconsistent with the dwarf - enriched models .",
    "the immediate environment of this feature is well fit by the models .    according to the cvd12a models , the 1@xmath35 m spectra depend only weakly on age and element abundances , as we show in figures  [ fig : compo_biggx_age][fig : compo_biggx_afe ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : compo_biggx_age ] compares the same observed composite spectrum against cvd12a models of varying age , all having the chabrier imf and solar @xmath4/fe .",
    "relative to the oldest model , younger ages reduce the systematic discrepancies , but the improvement is substantial only in the @xmath510050  region ( i.e. near pa@xmath30 ) , and ages as low as 35gyr would be required to match the strong absorption here . since the mean optical ssp - equivalent age is @xmath510gyr , and the equivalent age in the infrared should be older than in the optical , this does not seem to be a tenable solution , and may point to some incompleteness in the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : compo_biggx_afe ] similarly compares the observed composite spectrum against models with varying @xmath4/fe abundance ratio .",
    "increasing @xmath4/fe has strengthens the absorption at 9830 , improving the agreement immediately blue - wards of the wfb , but to leads to weaker the absorption at @xmath59700 , increasing the discrepancy with the data here .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to quantify our results , we compute `` lick - style '' line - strength indices for the wfb and cai features . for the wfb , we adopt the index defined as feh0.99 in cvd12a : feature band at 99059935  and pseudo - continua at 98559880  and 99409970 . to measure cai , we define a new index ( cai1.03 ) with feature band at 1033710360  and pseudo - continua at 1030010320  and 1036510390 .",
    "the feature band is carefully placed to isolate the imf - sensitive cai line , rather than the blended neighbouring absorption , and to minimise dependence on age and @xmath4/fe ratio , through examination of figures  [ fig : compo_biggx_imf][fig : compo_biggx_afe ] . when measuring the indices on the cvd12a models , we first match these models to the observed spectrum as before , using the weighted mean velocity dispersion of the galaxy stack , and allowing a fourth - order continuum correction to be fit independently for each model .",
    "the results are insensitive to the order of the correction polynomial applied , within reasonable limits .",
    "the index measurements made on the global composite spectrum are summarized in table  [ tab : sigsplit ] , and are compared to the model predictions in figure  [ fig : biggx_indices ] .",
    "the index errors are obtained by performing the index measurement on the bootstrap realisations of the composite spectrum .",
    "the measured feh0.99 is consistent with the chabrier or salpeter imf for models with solar abundance mixtures . for higher",
    "assumed @xmath4/fe ratios , more dwarf - enriched models are brought into closer agreement with the data .",
    "for the mildly @xmath4-enhanced model favoured by the optical data , the measured feh0.99 is consistent with a salpeter imf , marginally inconsistent with chabrier ( at the 2.2@xmath0 level ) and incompatible with the @xmath11=3 model ( at @xmath293@xmath0 ) . only by adopting [ @xmath4/fe]=+0.4 (",
    "which is inconsistent with [ mg / fe ] measured from optical spectroscopy ) can the @xmath11=3 model be brought within 2@xmath0 of the observed index .",
    "not unexpectedly , the predicted feh0.99 is sensitive to the iron abundance , but this is measured to be close to solar from the fit to the optical indices .",
    "the index also depends on the sodium abundance , which is not constrained from our optical spectra . for the substantial sodium enhancements ( up to + 1.0dex )",
    "suggested by the results of cvd12b , the predicted feh0.99 could be reduced by 0.2dex , which would yield agreement with the @xmath11=3 model .",
    "as noted above , casual examination of figure  [ fig : compo_biggx_imf ] might suggest a better match for chabrier models than for salpeter , in apparent disagreement with the index measurements .",
    "in fact , the index measurements implicitly force a more local continuum matching than the low - order polynomial correction we applied for the spectral comparison .",
    "because the models lie lower than the observed spectrum in the red pseudo - continuum band of feh0.99 , the predicted index is reduced relative to the observed value . figure  [ fig : indexspec ] ( left ) demonstrates this by plotting the wfb region after imposing a linear correction to normalise the pseudo - continua to unity in models and data alike . with this normalisation",
    "it becomes clearer how salpeter ( or slightly more dwarf - enriched ) models yield the closest agreement in the index value .",
    "however , this figure also highlights the failure of all models to match the detailed shape of the observed spectrum through the wfb region .",
    "the measured cai1.03 index for the observed composite spectrum is consistent with the chabrier imf , for either the solar abundance ratio or the @xmath4-enhanced models , and marginally inconsistent ( 2@xmath0 with the salpeter models .",
    "the dwarf - enriched @xmath11=3 models are excluded at the @xmath295@xmath0 level ( see also figure  [ fig : indexspec_cai ] , left ) . however , the cvd12a @xmath4-enhanced models assume that calcium , being an @xmath4-element , is enhanced in lock - step with magnesium and titanium etc .",
    "optical spectroscopic indices ( primarily ca4227 ) imply instead that the ca / fe ratio is lower than mg / fe on average ( e.g. vazdekis et al . 1997 ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ; smith et al .",
    "2009 ) , in which case the predicted cai1.03 will be too high .",
    "for the @xmath0@xmath29100  galaxies in our global composite , the contribution - weighted average [ ca / fe ] is + 0.07 , compared to [ mg / fe]=+0.25 .",
    "we estimate the effect of this by noting that for a chabrier imf ( for which cvd12a provide a variety of models with variation in individual element abundances ) , an increase by 0.15dex change in ca / h increases the cai1.03 index by 0.03 . applying this as a linear correction to the indices predicted by the [ @xmath4/fe]=+0.2 model , the chabrier and salpeter models are both at consistent with the data at the @xmath51@xmath0 level .",
    "the @xmath11=3 models would remain excluded ( @xmath294@xmath0 ) .",
    "we conclude that for coma red - sequence galaxies with @xmath0@xmath29100 , the strengths of the wing  ford band and the imf sensitive cai line at 10345  each support an imf with dwarf - star content similar to the salpeter case , once the known abundance information is taken into account .",
    "the concordance between the two indicators suggests that the average na / fe ratio , which influences the wfb , can not be too large : [ na / fe]@xmath36 + 1.0 would violate the consistency between feh0.99 and cai1.03 , for _ any _ imf , at the @xmath292.5@xmath0 level .",
    "most properties of red - sequence galaxies correlate with proxies for their mass , and in particular with internal velocity dispersion , @xmath0 .",
    "in general , galaxies with larger @xmath0 have older ssp - equivalent ages and higher abundances of @xmath4-elements ( including magnesium , calcium , titanium ) , and of carbon and nitrogen , although the iron abundance is flat or even declining with @xmath0 ( e.g. nelan et al . 2005 ; graves et al .",
    "2007 ; smith et al . 2009 ; johansson et al .",
    "recent work ( cvd12b ; spiniello et al .",
    "2012 ; ferreras et al . 2012 ) suggest that the imf may also depend on galaxy mass .",
    "for example , cvd12b find chabrier - like imfs favoured on average at @xmath0@xmath21150 , salpeter - like at @xmath0@xmath21250 , and steeper still for the most massive galaxies . in this section",
    "we divide the fmos sample according to velocity dispersion to examine the mass - dependence of the indices and derived imf for our sample .    in figure",
    "[ fig : compo_sigsplits ] , we show composite infrared spectra computed for galaxies in four ranges of velocity dispersion .",
    "the bin boundaries were defined to yield a similar signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath590@xmath19 in each stack . for these smaller samples ,",
    "the stacked spectra show occasional noise spikes which are probably due to incomplete rejection of sky - subtraction residuals .",
    "it is clear that four is as many bins as can be justified by the quality of the present data .",

    "qualitatively , we find only weak variations in the spectra as a function of @xmath0 , with all the main features of the spectra reproduced in all four composites .",
    "there is a hint for slightly stronger wfb in the most massive bin , but lower in the second - most massive bin , and hence no clear trend is apparent .",
    "the low-@xmath0 galaxies appear to show stronger cai .",
    "figure  [ fig : indices_sigsplits ] shows the feh0.99 and cai1.03 indices measured from the @xmath0-binned stacks , with comparison to the global composite and to the cvd12a model predictions .",
    "direct comparisons of observed and model spectra for the highest-@xmath0 bin are shown in figures  [ fig : indexspec ] ( right ) and [ fig : indexspec_cai ] ( right ) for feh0.99 and cai1.03 respectively .",
    "the predicted indices are derived after broadening the models to the contribution - weighted velocity dispersion of each stack , i.e. the doppler broadening correction is applied to the models , rather than to the data . for the predicted indices , we track the variation in @xmath4/fe ratio as a function of @xmath0 by interpolating between the cvd12a models , with [ @xmath4/fe]=0.0,+0.2,+0.3 and + 0.4 , to match the weighted - mean observed mg / fe . for feh0.99",
    ", the models are adjusted to track the average measured fe / h in each bin , and the predictions for cai1.03 account for the average measured ca / fe .",
    "the behaviour of the measured feh0.99 index in figure  [ fig : indices_sigsplits ] is not monotonic , with an apparently significant dip in the @xmath0@xmath21190  bin , as expected from the spectra .",
    "comparison to the constant - imf model predictions shows that this behaviour is expected , once allowance is made for the variation in fe / h ( by chance , this bin has lower average iron abundance than any other ) . with this correction ,",
    "all bins with velocity dispersion @xmath1210   are within 1@xmath0 from the predictions consistent with a common salpeter imf .",
    "the highest velocity dispersion bin has slightly higher feh0.99 ( 1.5@xmath0 from the salpeter prediction ) , but is still marginally inconsistent ( 2@xmath0 ) with the @xmath11=3 model .",
    "the cai1.03 index is consistent with salpeter models across the whole range in @xmath0 , once corrected for the measured ca / fe .",
    "( if instead we were to assume ca / fe = mg / fe , the results favour a chabrier imf . )",
    "there is no evidence in this index for increased dwarf content at high velocity dispersion : the @xmath37  bin is consistent with salpeter or chabrier imf , and inconsistent with the @xmath11=3 model at the 3.6@xmath0 level .    as discussed above , the conclusions for the wfb are somewhat sensitive to the sodium abundance which is not well constrained from other data . if we had assumed that na / fe increases with velocity dispersion , then we would have recovered a trend of increasing dwarf - enrichment with @xmath0 from feh0.99 , though cai1.03 would be unaffected .",
    "cvd12b find that the apparent increase in dwarf content in massive ellipticals may be better correlated with the mg / fe ratio , rather than with velocity dispersion ( their figure 5 ) .",
    "such a correlation would be very interesting , as mg / fe is generally interpreted as an indicator for the timescale of star - formation ( thomas et al .",
    "2005 ) , and thus reflects the physical conditions in galaxies during their major formation epoch .",
    "we test this result by binning our spectra according to ( optically - determined ) mg / fe ( figures  [ fig : compo_mgfesplits]-[fig : indices_mgfesplits ] and table  [ tab : sigsplit ] ) . for the wfb we measure an increase in the feh0.99 index strength with increasing mg / fe , for the bins with [ mg / fe]@xmath10.3 .",
    "the models show that for constant imf we would instead expect the index to fall with increased mg / fe ( reduced fe / h and increased velocity dispersion , as well as the direct effect of @xmath4/fe ) .",
    "the inferred imf drifts from chabrier ( or lighter ) at [ mg / fe]=+0.12 to salpeter at [ mg / fe]=+0.19 and close to @xmath11=3 at [ mg / fe]=+0.27 . for the [ mg / fe]@xmath290.3 bin , a lower index value is measured , but the recovered imf would still be marginally heavier than salpeter for the fe / h - corrected models .",
    "the cai1.03 index shows similar behaviour : the index value is fairly constant with mg / fe , within the errors , but fixed - imf models predict a declining trend ( mainly due to increased velocity broadening as the high - mg / fe bins have higher @xmath0 on average ) .",
    "hence the inferred imf becomes more dwarf - enriched with increasing mg / fe , ranging from chabrier to slightly heavier than salpeter .",
    "the observed trends with mg / fe are clearly only marginally significant in either index individually .",
    "taken in combination , however , the similar pattern derived from the two indices lends tentative support to the claim that @xmath4-enhanced populations formed in rapid bursts harbour more low - mass stars than galaxies with extended star - formation histories .",
    "in this section we focus on comparing our results to those presented ( during completion of this paper ) by conroy & van dokkum ( cvd12b ) .",
    "their study is directly comparable to ours in probing a similar range in galaxy properties ( although they have only two or three galaxies in the range covered by our lowest @xmath0 bin of 50130 ) , and in using optical spectra to constrain additional parameters ( age , element abundances ) so that possible imf variations can be investigated .",
    "our analysis differs from that of cvd12b first in combining the data from many galaxies into composite spectra .",
    "this has the advantage of rejecting ( or at least smoothing over ) sky - subtraction residuals and other artefacts , but obviously limits the degree to which we can test imf variations within the sample .",
    "second , our analysis method is different from that of cvd12b : whereas they perform a full - spectrum fit ( with a total of 22 free parameters ) , over their optical and far - red spectra simultaneously , we instead adopt most parameters from the best - fitting ssp model in the optical , and focus on the infrared indices to isolate the possible imf variations .",
    "a novel aspect of our work is that we introduce and exploit a new imf - sensitive index measuring the cai line at 10345 .",
    "in contrast to _ all _ of the `` classical '' imf - sensitive features ( wfb , nai doublet , caii triplet ) , this index is nearly independent of the sodium abundance , and hence provides an independent test which complements results obtained from other features .",
    "we quantify this statement using the cvd12a models : using the 13.5gyr , solar - abundance , chabrier - imf case as a fiducial point , we find that increasing na / fe by 0.3dex increases the nai0.82 index by 0.14 .",
    "if instead the na / fe is held fixed , but the imf is changed from chabrier to salpeter , this index increases by 0.12 .",
    "the ratio of sodium sensitivity to imf sensitivity for nai0.82 is thus 0.14/0.12=+1.17 . for the caii0.86 index ( measuring the caii triplet ) ,",
    "the equivalent ratio is + 0.44 , while for feh0.99 ( measuring the wfb ) , the ratio is 0.56 .",
    "( as emphasized by cvd12a , sodium indirectly affects the strength of many spectral features , since it is one of the dominant electron donors in cool stellar atmospheres , and hence changes the ionisation balance of other species . )",
    "by contrast , increasing na / fe by 0.3dex reduces the cai1.03 index by 0.002 , while changing to a salpeter imf increases this index by 0.036  and hence the sensitivity ratio is 0.06 , an order of magnitude smaller than the classical indices .",
    "our first - order result is that the wfb and cai measurements favour a salpeter - like imf on average in red - sequence / early - type galaxies , rather than the bottom - light chabrier / kroupa form found in the milky way .",
    "this is an important result , since it implies a @xmath550per cent correction to the k - band mass - to - light ratios for early - types relative to spirals .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the average result from cvd12b in the relevant mass range , and also agrees with recent lensing and dynamical analyses ( spiniello et al . 2011 ; cappellari et al . 2012 ) .    we do not recover a clear signal of _ increasing _ dwarf - enrichment with increasing mass ( traced by velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the evidence for such a trend in cvd12b is driven mainly by ( a ) their original stacked spectra of four virgo galaxies with @xmath0@xmath21300  from van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) , which require an imf significantly heavier salpeter , and ( b ) their @xmath510 galaxies at @xmath0@xmath13180  which favour a chabrier - like imf on average .",
    "we have few galaxies in the 300  regime , and our highest-@xmath0 bin is dominated by galaxies with @xmath0@xmath21240 .",
    "hence , our results do not exclude a steeper imf at the high - mass extreme . at lower @xmath0 , however , where our results are based on a much larger galaxy sample , our data clearly favour a salpeter imf , in apparent conflict with the chabrier - like solutions recovered by cvd12b .",
    "our analysis supports the trend found by cvd12b for an increase in the dwarf content of red - sequence galaxies as a function of their @xmath4-abundance ratio .",
    "notably , the only galaxies for which we infer a chabrier - like imf , similar to that of the milky way , are those which have abundance patterns closest to that of the milky way ( [ mg / fe]@xmath210.1 ) . for galaxies with high @xmath4-enhancements ratios ( [ mg / fe]@xmath100.3 )",
    ", thought to arise from formation in very rapid and intense star - bursts , the indices require imfs that are heavier than salpeter , though not so extreme as an @xmath11=3 power - law0.5@xmath2 ) . although a top - heavy imf in bursts has been proposed as an explanation for the sub - millimeter galaxy counts ( baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) , this needs only to affect the imf at much higher masses , 520@xmath2 ( see lacey et al .",
    "hence it is possible to construct an imf satisfying both constraints , although we reserve judgement as to whether it is physically plausible . ] .",
    "we emphasize that results obtained from the two measured indices are consistent with each other .",
    "cvd12b note that their results depend somewhat on which combinations of imf - sensitive features they include in their fits ( although their overall conclusions are robust ) .",
    "for example if the nai region is removed from the fit , they recover lower dwarf - enrichments , whereas if both nai and the caii triplet are removed , so that only the wfb is constraining the imf , then even heavier solutions are recovered .",
    "their best - fitting models require large enhancements in na / fe , of up to an order of magnitude higher than the solar ratio in some cases . since all three classical imf indicators are affected ( directly or indirectly ) by the sodium abundance , it is important for future work to determine whether this high sodium enrichment is real , and not an artefact of inconsistencies between the various fitted features0.1dex ) enhancements were found by bensby et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for bulge dwarfs and subgiants . ] .",
    "in the meantime , it is encouraging that our sodium - independent cai1.03 index yields results which are concordant with those from the wfb .",
    "we finish by briefly comparing our results to two recent spectroscopic works based on the nai doublet .",
    "spiniello et al .",
    "( 2012 ) analysed galaxies with velocity dispersions generally larger than average for our sample , but overlapping our two highest-@xmath0 bins .",
    "they find a trend of increasing imf slope from salpeter - like at @xmath0@xmath21200  ( in agreement with our results at the same velocity dispersion ) to @xmath11@xmath213 at @xmath0@xmath21335  ( a regime not probed by our sample ) .",
    "ferreras et al .",
    "( 2012 ) report consistency with a salpeter - like imf at @xmath0@xmath21200and @xmath11@xmath213 at 300 . at lower mass",
    ", they infer a constant kroupa - like imf at @xmath0@xmath13150 , which may be marginally discrepant with the salpeter imf favoured by our results in this mass range .",
    "this comparison should be viewed with caution however , since ferreras et al .",
    "have not yet taken into account the possible effect of na / fe variations as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that our sample differs from both spiniello et al . and ferreras et al . in studying only rich galaxy cluster members .",
    "it is not yet known whether apparent imf variations are correlated in any way with galaxy environment .",
    "we have presented new infrared spectroscopy for red - sequence galaxies in coma , and measured gravity - sensitive absorption features to probe their low - mass stellar content .",
    "compared to other recent work in this field , our study differs in targetting cluster galaxies , and in sampling `` typical '' red - sequence galaxies , rather than only the most massive objects . by comparing line - strength indices against state - of - the - art spectral synthesis models , tuned to match element abundances estimated from optical data , we derive constraints on the average imf and its variation with velocity dispersion and @xmath4-abundance ratio .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * the average rest - frame 1@xmath35 m spectra for sizable samples of galaxies at the distance of coma can be recovered with subaru / fmos , thanks to its wide - field multiplex capability which is currently unique in the infrared . * the observed spectral features are generally in good qualitative agreement with the latest stellar libraries and synthesis models , although some localised discrepancies are seen . *",
    "the cai line at 10345  is promising as a new gravity - sensitive feature , which unlike the `` classical '' imf indicators is independent of the sodium abundance . *",
    "the strength of the wing ",
    "ford band and cai 10345   line indicate that red - sequence galaxies in coma have ( on average ) a dwarf - star content similar to that in a salpeter imf .",
    "* there is no clear trend in the derived imf as a function of velocity dispersion , with salpeter models an adequate fit from @xmath0@xmath21100  to @xmath0@xmath21250 . *",
    "a more dwarf - dominated imf can not be ruled out at the highest velocity dispersions ( @xmath0@xmath10300 ) , which are not well sampled by our observations . *",
    "the derived imf is correlated with mg / fe ratio suggesting that galaxies which underwent intense rapid starbursts formed a larger number of low - mass stars per solar - mass star .",
    "our work adds to a developing consensus that massive red - sequence galaxies have heavier imfs , with a greater contribution from low - mass stars , than found in the milky way .",
    "a salpeter - like imf is favoured by recent spectroscopic ( cvd12b ; spiniello et al .",
    "2012 ; ferreras et al . 2012 ; this work ) , dynamical ( thomas et al . 2011 ; cappellari et al . 2012 ) and lensing analyses ( spiniello et al . 2011 ; sonnenfeld et al .",
    "2012 ) . for spiral galaxies , in contrast ,",
    "recent lensing results are consistent with chabrier - like imfs similar to the milky way ( brewer et al . 2012 ) , consistent with earlier dynamical results ( bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "together with the apparent correlation of dwarf - star content with mg / fe ratio found here and in cvd12c , these results strongly suggest that the low - mass imf may be dictated in part by the dominant mode of star - formation : quiescent star formation yields kroupa - like imf , while star - bursts lead to an excess of low - mass stars .",
