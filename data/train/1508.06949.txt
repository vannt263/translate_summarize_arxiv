    "with the advent of quantum computation and communication , entanglement has appeared as a very important resource @xcite .",

    "entanglement is produced in many physical systems and there exists a large number of criteria for detection of entanglement ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first inseparability criterion was proposed by peres @xcite in 1996 . since then",
    "several inseparability inequalities have been reported for two mode and multi - mode states @xcite .",
    "for the present study , we have mostly used higher order version of two criteria of hillery and zubairy @xcite . to be precise ,",

    "a completely quantum mechanical description of stimulated and spontaneous raman processes described in fig . [ fig : scheme ] is given by the hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath0    where h.c .",
    "stands for the hermitian conjugate . throughout the present paper ,",
    "we use @xmath1 .",
    "the annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath2 correspond to the laser ( pump ) mode , stokes mode , vibration ( phonon ) mode and anti - stokes mode , respectively .",

    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the stokes and anti - stokes coupling constants , respectively . coupling constant @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) denotes the strength of coupling between the stokes ( anti - stokes ) mode and the vibrational ( phonon ) mode and depends on the actual interaction mechanism .",
    "the dimension of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are that of frequency and consequently @xmath13 and @xmath14 are dimensionless .",
    "further , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are very small compared to unity .",
    "further , we would like to note that in our present study , only one vibration ( phonon ) mode has been considered for the mathematical simplicity . in order to study the possibility of the existence of higher order entanglement",
    ", we need simultaneous solutions of the following heisenberg operator equations of motion for various field operators : @xmath15 the above set of equations ( [ eq : equn of motion ] ) is coupled nonlinear differential equations of filed operator and are not exactly solvable in the closed analytical form under weak pump condition .",
    "however , for the very strong pump , the operator @xmath7 can be replaced by a @xmath9 number and these equations ( [ eq : equn of motion ] ) are exactly solvable in that case @xcite . in order to solve these equations under weak pump approximation",
    ", we have used sen - mandal perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "the solutions obtained using this approach are more general than the one obtained for the same system using well - known short - time approximation .",
    "details of the calculations are given in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "here we just note that under weak pump approximation , the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : equn of motion ] ) assume the following form :    @xmath16    the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are computed the initial boundary conditions . in order to obtain the solutions we use the boundary condition as at @xmath19 , in the first term of the eq .",
    "( [ soln1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . under these initial conditions",
    "the corresponding solutions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are already reported in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the same is included here as appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "the solution ( [ soln1 ] ) , is valid up to the second orders in @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in what follows",
    ", we consider @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the detunings @xmath28 and @xmath29 are usually very small . in the present work we have chosen @xmath30 mhz and @xmath31 mhz .",
    "in order to investigate the higher - order entanglement in spontaneous and stimulated raman processes , we assume that all photon and phonon modes are initially coherent . in other words , the composite boson field consisting of photons and",
    "phonon is in an initial state which is product of coherent states .",
    "therefore , the composite coherent state arises from the product of the coherent states @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are the eigenkets of @xmath35 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "thus , the initial composite state is @xmath36 it is clear that the initial state is separable . now the field operator @xmath37 operating on such a composite coherent state gives rise to the complex eigenvalue @xmath38 hence we have , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of input photons in the pump mode . in a similar fashion",
    ", we can also describe three more complex amplitudes @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 corresponding to the stokes , vibrational ( phonon ) and anti - stokes field mode operators @xmath44 @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that for a spontaneous process , the complex amplitudes except for the pump mode , are necessarily zero .",
    "thus , in the spontaneous raman process , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for partially spontaneous process @xcite , the complex amplitude @xmath47 and any one / two of the remaining three eigenvalues are nonzero while the other two / one complex amplitudes are / is zero . in the present investigation , we consider that the eigenvalue corresponding to the pump mode is complex i.e. , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the phase angle , but the other eigenvalues ( i.e. , eigenvalues for the stokes , vibrational ( phonon ) and anti - stokes modes ) are real .      in order to investigate the higher order two mode entanglement , we use two criteria due to hillery and zubairy @xcite .",
    "the first criteria of hillery and zubairy is @xmath50 and the second criterion is @xmath51 where@xmath52 and @xmath53 are any two arbitrary operators and @xmath54 here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the positive integers and the lowest possible values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57 which corresponds to the normal ( lowest ) order intermodal entanglement .",
    "a quantum state is said to be higher order entangled ( bi - partite ) if it is found to satisfy the equation ( [ eq : hz-1 ] ) and/or equation ( [ eq : hz-2 ] ) for any choice of the integers @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfying @xmath58 from here onward we will refer to these criteria ( [ eq : hz-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hz-2 ] ) as hz-1 criterion and hz-2 criterion , respectively .",
    "more specifically , a higher order entangled state is one which is witnessed via a higher order ( order @xmath59 correlation function and as per this definition all multi - partite ( multi - mode ) entangled states are also higher order entangled .",
    "before we proceed further , we note that these two criteria are only sufficient ( not necessary ) for detection of entanglement .",
    "keeping this fact in mind , we have applied both of these two criteria to investigate the existence of higher order intermodal entanglement between various modes and have observed higher order intermodal entanglement in various situations . in what follows ,",

    "( [ ab]-[bd ] ) that for spontaneous raman process eqs .",

    "it is interesting to note that higher order intermodal entanglement is observed in pump - stokes mode , although in the lowest order it was not observed .",
    "further , the figures show that the depths of the nonclassicality parameters @xmath61 and @xmath68 increase with the order",
    ". use of hz-1 criteria also led to similar features in the partially spontaneous raman process ( not in figure ) .",
    "in other words , we observed signatures of intermodal entanglement in all the cases except pump - phonon ( @xmath83 ) and phonon - anti - stokes ( @xmath84 ) modes .",
