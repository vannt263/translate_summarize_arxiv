    "recent studies of pattern formation and pattern dynamics in spatially extended systems have provided important clues to understand nonlinear mechanisms of nonequilibrium conditions in many physical phenomena such as , e.g. , laser dynamics  @xcite , electroconvection  @xcite , rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite , field - induced phenomena in magnetic fluids  @xcite , and many others@xcite .",
    "a very popular way to study pattern formation is by using networks of coupled oscillators ruled locally by time - discrete mappings , the so - called coupled map lattices@xcite .",
    "such networks of maps were applied e.g.  to model information coding  @xcite , to study nonlinear wave - like patterns  @xcite , ocean convection parameterization  @xcite , synchronization processes  @xcite .",
    "usually , coupled map lattices are regarded as a discretize version of reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite , because they involve a set of discrete - time nonlinear oscillators coupled through diffusion alone .",
    "pattern formation in networks of maps was already studied for this purely diffusive regime@xcite . however , as is well - known@xcite , spatially extended phenomena are quite frequently subject not only to diffusion but also to advection . denoting by @xmath3 the advection strength at site @xmath4 ,",
    "a simple way of incorporating advection in networks of maps was proposed recently@xcite being embodied in the following equation of motion @xmath5 where @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the lattice size , @xmath8 represents the diffusion . following common practice",
    ", we also use the logistic map , @xmath9 , to drive the local dynamics . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are discretized forms of the diffusion and advection operators , namely    [ terms ] @xmath12    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath3 must be in the interval @xmath13 .",
    "we impose periodic boundary condition : @xmath14 .    for @xmath15 eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) reduces to the well - known purely diffusive model , while for @xmath16 one obtains the two possible one - way coupling regimes@xcite . in the presence of advection one",
    "may distinguish two different situations : _ homogeneous advection _",
    ", when @xmath17 for all sites @xmath4 , and _ inhomogeneous advection _ , when the @xmath3 are free to vary along the lattice . in an earlier",
    "investigation@xcite we described how the spatial periodicity ( wavelength ) of wave - like patterns evolve with the advection strength .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how advection affects the _ temporal _ stability of patterns . in particular , we address the question of how and under which conditions advection changes pattern evolutions from chaotic to periodic evolutions .",
    "the stability of solutions in dynamical systems is established by the well - known lyapunov analysis , considering the so - called local lyapunov exponents , defined from the logarithm of the eigenvalues of the system .",
    "if the evolution is periodic one finds a negative exponent while for chaotic evolutions the exponent is positive .",
    "local lyapunov exponents are computed in a static frame .",
    "however , recently  @xcite it was shown that , for particular situations such as one - way coupling regimes , unstable perturbations may travel along the lattice , with a corresponding _ negative _ local lyapunov exponents . therefore , local lyapunov exponents may not be always suitable to characterize the stability of such solutions . to cure this shortcoming one uses the so - called co - moving lyapunov exponents@xcite .",
    "co - moving lyapunov exponents are defined from the eigenvalues of a jacobian computed in a moving frame having some ` velocity ' .",
    "the most important feature of co - moving exponents lies in the fact that they allow to discriminate between ( i ) absolute stability , ( ii ) absolute instability and ( iii ) convective instability , which is a possible feature in spatially extended systems .",
    "furthermore , with co - moving lyapunov exponents one may study , e.g. , transitions from regular patterns to spatiotemporal intermittency@xcite , propagation of correlations  @xcite , and predictability@xcite .    in this paper we study the stability of pattern evolutions using both local and co - moving lyapunov exponents . in section 2",
    "we start with a situation where advection is homogeneously distributed . in section 3",
    "we consider nontrivial behaviors of pattern evolutions when advection varies in space .",
    "final conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study the influence of diffusion and homogeneous advection in pattern evolutions when ruled by eq .",

    "we start computing the local lyapunov exponents , given by the logarithm of the maximum absolute value of all eigenvalues of the jacobian of eq .",

    ", local lyapunov exponents reduce to the lyapunov exponents of the local map , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we use a sample of @xmath20 sets of initial conditions of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the unstable fixed point of the local logistic map , @xmath23 is a homogeneously distributed random value in the range @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 .",

    "( [ model ] ) is computed over @xmath20 time - steps after discarding a transient of @xmath26 time - steps . for purely diffusive coupling ( @xmath27 )",
    "one knows@xcite that local lyapunov exponents decrease .",

    "[ fig1]b , where @xmath28 , showing a lyapunov spectrum which , before the accumulation point @xmath29@xcite , has a similar shape as that of the uncoupled regime . above the accumulation point one observes a much larger exponent fluctuation then that of the uncoupled regime .",

    "[ fig1]b and [ fig1]c one concludes that , apparently , advection does not change significantly the local lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the main difference between the presence and absence of advection is observed above the accumulation point , where the large fluctuations observed in the purely diffusive regime are then shortened .",
    "in general , these observations remain valid for any diffusion and advection strengths . for either periodic or chaotic local dynamics@xcite",
    ", our simulations have shown that diffusion promotes the stabilization of local amplitudes .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the co - moving lyapunov exponent for traveling waves solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) and for chaotic pattern evolutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) when advection is increased from the purely diffusive regime to the one - way coupling regime .",
    "the contour lines under these figures indicate the boundaries where the co - moving lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "static evolutions are always absolutely stable when @xmath53 varies from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , and therefore are not shown .    for traveling waves",
    "one observes a gradual increase of the co - moving lyapunov exponents reaching a convectively unstable state for very strong advection ( @xmath56 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a .    for chaotic pattern evolutions a surprising effect",
    "is observed : by tuning properly the advection parameter it is possible to stabilize unstable chaotic pattern evolutions .",
    "in fact , from fig .",
    "[ fig4]b one clearly observes two narrow ranges of advection strengths for which _ absolute stability _ is observed , i.e.  all co - moving lyapunov exponents become negative . in other words ,",
    "the chaotic evolution abruptly starts to evolve periodically for these ranges of advection .",
    "this observation strongly suggest that , in fact , _ advection may induce a sort of synchronization in a chaotic ensemble of nonlinear oscillators_. notice that the nonlinearity of the local map is strongly chaotic , namely one has @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we compare the results above , obtained for uniform advection , with those for a more realistic and complicated situation in which the strenght and direction of advection vary from site to site . to this end , for each site @xmath4 we choose a value @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are random numbers homogeneously distributed between @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 measures the range where advection strength may fluctuate , i.e. measures the ` inhomogeneous fluctuation ' , yielding @xmath63 , with @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 we are back to the purely diffusive regime , while for @xmath66 one has maximum range of variation .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the co - moving lyapunov spectrum of a traveling wave solution , for an inhomogeneous advection with four different values of @xmath62 , namely for @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a the advection strength varies in space , but its direction ( sign ) remains unchanged , namely values of @xmath53 are always positive , while in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b both the strength and the direction of advection vary randomly in space .    comparing fig .",
    "[ fig5]a and fig .",
    "[ fig5]b with the lyapunov spectrum of the traveling wave solution in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one clearly sees that the maximum co - moving lyapunov exponents increases with @xmath62 , either when the direction of advection changes or not . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a , this increase of the lyapunov exponents is related to an increase of spatial disorder in the spatiotemporal diagram of the pattern evolution .",
    "in fact , when inhomogeneous advection is introduced , the traveling wave can not maintain its wave - like shape through the entire lattice .",
    "instead , only certain small domains maintain their wave - like shape .",
    "these domains may either remain static in an ` environment ' which evolves chaotically , or appear and disappear intermittently .",
    "these latter domains which appear and disappear , we call pulses .    the occurrence of such pulses depends on the amplitude @xmath62 of the interval where advection is varied .",
    "figure [ fig6]b shows the maximum co - moving lyapunov exponent as a function of @xmath62 , indicating two particular values for which pulses are observed .",
    "as one clearly sees , pulses are characterized by an abrupt decrease of the maximum co - moving lyapunov exponent , and this feature seems to prevail when varying the set of initial conditions and the time interval during which lyapunov exponents are computed .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to use local and co - moving lyapunov exponents to characterize both periodic and aperiodic pattern evolutions in diffusive - advective coupled map lattices as defined in ref .",
    "the effects of advection in the evolution of patterns were studied for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous advection fields .",
    "the main result is that there are specific ranges of advection strengths which induce chaotic pattern evolutions to evolve periodically .",
    "this is observed from the fact that for those particular advection ranges all co - moving lyapunov exponents turn out to be negative , i.e.  the pattern evolution changes from an absolutely unstable state to an absolutely stable state .    for the particular case of one - way coupling regime ,",
    "while the static pattern evolution remains absolutely stable , both traveling waves and chaotic pattern evolutions become conditionally unstable . moreover",
    ", we showed that diffusion promotes the stability of local oscillators , corroborating previous studies  @xcite .",
    "for homogeneous advection , our simulations have shown that variation of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ deissler_comov ] ) does not change significantly the final value of the co - moving lyapunov exponent .    for an inhomogeneous advection field ,",
    "traveling wave solutions are ` destroyed ' , and only small domains in the lattice keep their wave - like shape .",
    "these domains may appear and disappear intermittently corresponding to an abrupt decrease of the maximum co - moving lyapunov exponent .",
    "for inhomogeneous advection , the co - moving lyapunov exponent varies with the size @xmath68 of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ deissler_comov ] ) .",
    "in fact , preliminary results have shown that there is a pair of values of the matrix size @xmath68 and frame velocity @xmath38 for which the co - moving lyapunov exponent reaches a minimum .",
    "therefore , we believe that by varying the value of @xmath68 one should be able to ascertain when and where the pulses emerge in the lattice . this interesting characterization together with a few additional issues will be presented elsewhere .",
