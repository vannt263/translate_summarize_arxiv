    "[ fig : fdr ] , where we have normalized both correlation and response by the equal time fluctuation @xmath62 .",

    "the fdr shrinks . while it can be convenient to characterize this crossover by the single temperature @xmath0 , it is more accurate to think of a temperature range over which the long - time behaviour of system changes smoothly from effective to ineffective assembly . this smooth change is accompanied by a smooth change in the fdr .",
    "we conclude that if a system is to be designed so that it assembles effectively , the correlation - response ratio can be used to obtain a general prediction for the regime of good assembly , before running the long simulations required to test the yield directly .",
    "finally , note that we constructed fig .",
    "[ fig : fdr ] using data at constant @xmath24 and variable @xmath29 , since the gradient of this plot gives the fdr .",
    "this procedure requires a separate simulation for each data point .",
    "however , if we only wish to know if the integrated response is small or large compared to the fdt prediction , it is sufficient to use data at a single @xmath29 : a simple comparison of @xmath65 and @xmath48 is already quite informative in that case ( note however @xcite ) .",
    "we now consider the kinetic and thermodynamic crossovers in a little more detail .",
    "we then discuss how the change in fdr at the kinetic crossover arises , and the extent to which we expect it to generalize to other self - assembling systems .",
    "we measure the yield of our assembly processes by running long simulations of length @xmath66 ( recall figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "these simulations have three types of final state . at high temperatures ,",
    "no assembly takes place , and the system consists primarily of free subunits . at low temperatures ,",
    "the system evolves into a state that consists primarily of disordered metastable clusters .",
    "we also find an intermediate temperature regime , in which the final state has a substantial quantity of assembled products .",
    "this regime is delineated by two crossovers . for an operational definition of the high temperature crossover",
    ", we impose a threshold on the relative probabilities of bonded and free subunits at time @xmath66 .",
    "while this definition depends on @xmath66 , the position of the crossover has a well - defined limit as @xmath67 , which can be evaluated from the contribution of free subunits to the thermodynamic partition function of the system .",
    "thus we refer to this crossover as `` thermodynamic '' .    to define the low temperature crossover",
    ", we consider the relative probabilities of disordered clusters and correctly - assembled products at @xmath66 . as the temperature",
    "is reduced , the maximum of the yield occurs when the disordered clusters are common enough to significantly impede assembly .",
    "we therefore identify this maximum with the low temperature crossover .",
    "if we calculate the yield in the equilibrium state , we expect it to depend monotonically on the temperature , since the correctly - assembled states minimise the total energy in both of our systems .",
    "thus , the presence of the maximum in the yield is a kinetic effect , that arises from the slow annealing of disordered clusters .",
    "this motivates our use of the term `` kinetic crossover '' .",
    "clearly , the existence of a regime of efficient assembly requires that the kinetic crossover is not too close to the thermodynamic one .",
    "if the system crosses over smoothly from free subunits to disordered clusters , then there is no temperature at which assembly is efficient on the time scale @xmath66 .",
    "we now return to the link between the kinetic crossover and the fdr .",
    "the general idea is that dynamics that is locally time - reversal symmetric allows disordered states to anneal into ordered states .",
    "this idea is not new ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite , especially its fig .",
    "however , the fdr provides a quantitative measure of this effect .",
    "the crystalline state of the two - dimensional system of discs is close - packed , with each particle bonded to six neighbors . during assembly",
    ", the fraction of such particles in a given cluster provides a measure of its crystallinity .",
    "as clusters form , there are many possible states with low crystallinity , and the system tends to visit these states quite frequently .",
    "the effectiveness of assembly depends on whether these states are able to anneal into crystalline clusters .",
    "this annealing becomes more difficult as the disordered clusters grow .",
    "for example , annealing the disordered clusters of fig .",
    "[ fig : disc_yield ] into crystallites requires highly co - operative processes with large activation energies , while annealing small disordered clusters requires less co - operativity .",
    "our results indicate that near optimal assembly , large disordered clusters are avoided because the system remains _ locally equilibrated _ at each stage of the assembly process ( although the system is globally out of equilibrium ) . at any stage of assembly , there will be a set of likely states .",
    "the condition of local equilibration is that the relative probabilities of these likely states reflect their relative boltzmann weights .",
    "if this condition holds , the system avoids the disordered states that are precursors to the large disordered clusters of fig .",
    "[ fig : disc_yield ] . for example , small disordered clusters have smaller boltzmann weights than crystalline clusters of the same size , so local equilibration suppresses the disordered states .",
    "on the other hand , if disordered states are likely at any stage of assembly , this indicates that they are not being annealed into crystallites , and are likely to evolve into larger disordered clusters .    to link this argument with the fdr",
    ", we first demonstrate a link between local equilibration and an approximate time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we consider two states @xmath68 and @xmath69 that are both likely at a given stage of assembly .",
    "the rate with which the system makes transitions from @xmath68 to @xmath69 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the probability that the system is in state @xmath68 at time @xmath24 , and @xmath72 is the rate for transitions to state @xmath69 given that the system is initially in state @xmath68 .",
    "[ the rate @xmath73 depends only on the dynamical rules of the model , while the rate @xmath74 depends also on the state of the system at time @xmath24 ] .    for models that obey detailed balance , we have @xmath76 further , if the system is locally equilibrated then we have @xmath77 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are likely states at this time . thus , the rates for forward and reverse transitions between these states are equal : @xmath78 this relation is an approximate time - reversal symmetry of the locally equilibrated state , which holds on time scales for which the set of likely states is not changing significantly .",
    "the extent to which this approximate time - reversal symmetry holds is correlated with the degree of local equilibration , and hence with the extent to which the system is discriminating between high - energy disordered states and low - energy ordered ones . by avoiding the high - energy disordered states , the locally equilibrated system tends to assemble effectively .    to link this local equilibration with the fdr , we show in the appendix that , for systems obeying detailed balance , deviations from fdt arise from differences between the probabilities of trajectories and their time - reversed counterparts , during the time between perturbation and measurement .",
    "the key result is ( [ equ : fdr_rev ] ) . we conclude that the fdr is a probe of the degree to which the system obeys time - reversal symmetry between times @xmath29 and @xmath24 , and hence of the degree of local equilibration .",
    "thus , our results for both capsid and disc systems ( fig .  [ fig : fdr ] ) are consistent both with our hypothesis that the system falls out of local equilibrium at the kinetic crossover , and with our interpretation of the fdr as a measure of local equilibration .",
    "the parametric plots summarize the important features of the correlation and response functions , in a single system - independent plot , in which time and energy scales are rescaled away .",
    "the qualitative similarities in the behavior of the fdr are all the more remarkable given the different dimensionalities of the two models that we consider , and the very different structures of their assembled states .      while the behavior of both capsid and disc systems are both consistent with our analysis above , there are important differences between the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fdr ] .",
    "in particular , at the peak of the assembly curve , the response in the disc system is larger than the corresponding response in the capsid system .",
    "the reason for this difference can be inferred from the states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield ] and  [ fig : disc_yield ] . in the disc system ,",
    "the crystallinity of the product is rather low at all temperatures .",
    "even small clusters typically explore many disordered states before they form locally crystalline structures .",
    "the system needs to be very close to local equilibrium in order to ensure that the ordered structures can be discriminated from the large number of disordered states .",
    "thus , assembly is effective only when the fdr is close to unity . on the other hand , the directional interactions in the model capsid system",
    "impose quite stringent constraints on the local structure of the growing cluster .",
    "this reduces the possibility for stable disordered clusters , and discriminating between ordered and disordered states is easier .",
    "thus , the system still assembles effectively even when deviations from local equilibrium are quite significant , and assembly is still effective even when deviations from fdt are quite large .    taking account of these differences , we emphasize the main feature of fig .  [",
    "fig : fdr ] : the fdr is large above the kinetic crossover , and small below it .",
    "we expect this behavior to be preserved as long three conditions are met .",
    "firstly , the observables used to construct the fdr should couple to the processes by which metastable disordered states are annealed into ordered ones . for example",
    ", if we had measured the fdr in the capsid system using the capsomer positions in place of their energies , then diffusive processes would dominate both correlation and response functions , and this response is not sensitive to the extent to which the bonds in the system are locally equilibrated .",
    "secondly , we require that the assembled state of the system minimizes the free energy both globally and locally .",
    "many biological systems are believed to have funnel - shaped energy landscapes consistent with this constraint @xcite .",
    "the models presented in this article also have this property .",
    "we believe that satisfying this constraint contributes quite generally to good assembly , and it is therefore practical to bear it in mind when designing self - assembling systems . of course ,",
    "systems that violate this constraint do exist . for example , in three dimensions , minimization of the free energy of small clusters of spherical particles lead to icosahedral structures @xcite , while the crystalline phase has a close - packed structure .",
    "it is therefore possible for these particles to assemble into icosahedral structures while always remaining locally equilibrated .",
    "the fdr would be close to unity , but the system would never visit the ` correctly assembled ' close - packed structure .",
    "the third condition that is required to ensure usefulness of the parametric fdr plot concerns the time @xmath24 used to construct it . the behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : fdr ] depends weakly on the value of @xmath24 , but changing its order of magnitude will lead to different behavior . in particular , at very low temperatures and for large @xmath24 , the capsid system shows an fdr close to unity .",
    "this occurs because the system is locally equilibrated over a particular set of disordered states .",
    "however , in this case , the system would not be locally equilibrated while the disordered clusters were forming , so that fdr on that time scale would have been smaller than unity .",
    "in other words , detection of the relevant deviations from local equilibrium requires a measurement on the time scales during which those deviations occur .",
    "these three conditions show that the application of the fdr to self - assembling systems requires some consideration of the relevant observables and time scales . however , for the systems studied in this article , meeting these conditions does not require careful tuning of model parameters , but only the kind of qualitative analysis discussed in this section .",
    "this represents evidence in favor of the applicability of these methods to other self - assembling systems .",
    "the arguments of section  [ sec : discussion ] seem general , and relatively independent of details of the system .",
    "further tests of the links between efficient assembly , local equilibration , and fdrs would be valuable , especially if fdrs could be measured experimentally . in principle",
    ", fdrs can be obtained whenever conjugate correlation and response functions can be measured .",
    "measuring fluctuations and responses of local quantities , such as the energy of a single subunit , requires a high degree of experimental control , but methods do exist in some systems . for example , wang _ et al _",
    "@xcite recently measured an fdr in a three dimensional glassy colloidal system .",
    "the diffusive correlation function is conjugate to the response of a single particle to a force in that case .",
    "applying similar methods to ordering processes of spheres or discs would be analogous to our studies of the sticky disc system .    turning to biological systems",
    ", it would be possible to measure the degree of kinetic frustration in the folding of biomolecules , either computationally in more detailed capsid models , or in systems such as the trpzip peptide  @xcite , or experimentally , in rna folding , by a generalization of the experiment of  @xcite . in this latter case , the conjugate variables of force and displacement are already measurable , although obtaining good statistics for the correlations and responses as a function of both @xmath24 and @xmath29 might be challenging .",
    "results obtained in this way would complement information about the non - equilibrium dynamics obtained from analysis of the work distribution  @xcite .",
    "for example , the thermodynamic definitions of reversible and irreversible work are linked to the idea that non - equilibrium processes can occur with or without local equilibration . by characterizing the extent to which particular degrees of freedom are locally equilibrated on particular time scales ,",
    "fdrs provide another link between these thermodynamic ideas and the statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium trajectories .",
