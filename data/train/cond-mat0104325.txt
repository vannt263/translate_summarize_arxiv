    "in recent years considerable study has been given to the theory of self - organized criticality ( soc ) that explains spontaneous ( avalanche - type ) dynamics , unlike the typical phase transitions that occur only when a control parameter is driven to a critical value @xcite , @xcite . a main feature of the systems displaying soc is their self - similarity that derives to a power - law distribution over avalanche sizes . respectively , soc models are mostly studied by making use of the scaling - type arguments supplemented with extensive computer simulations ( see @xcite ) . on the contrary , in this paper we put forward an analytical approach , which is enable to describe in phenomenological manner both process of a single avalanche formation and behavior of whole avalanche ensemble .",
    "the soc behavior appears in vast variety of systems such as a real sand pile ( ensemble of grains of sand moving along increasingly tilted surface ) @xcite  @xcite , intermittency in biological evolution @xcite , earthquakes and forest - fires , depinning transitions in random medium and so on ( see @xcite ) . among the above models the sandpile is the simplest and most widely studied as analytically @xcite , @xcite , so numerically @xcite  @xcite . in analytical direction , a variety of field theory approaches is worthwhile to notice . among them ,",
    "the field scheme @xcite based on nonlinear diffusion equation has failed to account for the main feature of self - organizing systems  the self - consistent character of avalanche dynamics .",
    "the visible reason is that using one - parameter approach does not take into account a feedback between open subsystem and environment that are related to order and control parameters , respectively ( see criticism in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite also ) .",
    "much more substantial picture is given within two - parameter approaches @xcite  @xcite , @xcite that use both fundamental fields : gauge ones related to hydrodynamical modes type of sand pile height and material fields as a number of moving sand grains ( avalanche size ) .",
    "making use of the mean - field approximation shows that the self - similar regime of the sand pile dynamics is relevant to subcritical behavior , where a characteristic time of the order parameter variation is much more than the same for the control parameter , and the latter follows the former adiabatically .",
    "such type adiabatic behavior is inherent in usual regime of system evolving in course of phase transitions @xcite and jammed motion of vehicles @xcite , so that adiabatic approach will be put on basis of our consideration .",
    "perfect treatment of the soc has been achieved within three - parameter approach based on the reggeon field theory that uses the density of active sites @xmath1 as the order parameter and conserved field of the energy density @xmath2 as the control parameter @xcite , @xcite . along this line",
    ", soc regime appears as a result of competition between a rate of the energy input @xmath3 and a dissipation rate @xmath4 .",
    "it is appeared that the system under consideration behaves in quite different manner in case of fixed energy , when @xmath5 and total energy is conserved , and for driven sandpile , when @xmath6 , @xmath7 at stationarity condition @xmath8 .",
    "the first case shows @xcite , @xcite to be reduced to the picture of supercritical regime , where nonhomogeneity of initial distribution of energy arrives at a non - markovian term and space - dependent parameters of theory . at dimensions above critical value @xmath9 ,",
    "this case is found to be identical to the simplest landau picture with @xmath10 in active stationary state @xmath11 and @xmath12 in absorbing configuration @xmath13 .",
    "fundamentally different picture appears in the case of driven sandpile , where due to external input @xmath6 the energy density is lost as an independent field being reduced to the critical value @xmath14 . here , the average magnitude of the density of active sites is equal @xmath15 , so that the susceptibility @xmath16 is turned out to be @xmath17 . respectively , a response function behaves at large distances @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a space dimension , @xmath21 is a correlation length being scale of a system size @xmath22 .",
    "it is remarkable that such mean - field - type behavior is caused solely by stationary condition and translational invariance @xcite .",
    "a set of basic critical exponents governing scaling avalanche formation reads @xcite : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . on the other hand , scaling relations accompanied by equality of the susceptibility and mean size of avalanche yield the following expressions @xmath27 for the exponents of the avalanche size distribution @xmath28 where a critical size @xmath29 is connected with system size @xmath30 and a characteristic time @xmath31 as @xmath32 ( exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 are fractal dimension and dynamical exponent related to a critical avalanche , respectively ) . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the mean - field magnitudes of the above exponents are as follows : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    along the standard approach @xcite",
    ", we will use as gauge , so material fields : being reduced to velocity components and sand pile slope , the formers are considered at study of a single avalanche formation , whereas the latters are reduced to the number of moving sand grains at examination of a distribution over avalanche sizes .",
    "section  [ sec : level2 ] contains the self - consistent theory of the flux steady - state developed along the first direction .",
    "it enables us to treat the problem of a single avalanche formation on the basis of the unified analytical approach being relevant to the case of fixed energy in refs .",
    "@xcite . section  [ sec : level3 ] deals with accounting additive noises of the sand velocity components and sand pile slope .",
    "the noise intensities increase is shown to make possible avalanche emergence even in non - driven systems . by this , the control parameter noise plays a crucial role .",
    "such type fluctuational regime corresponds to the case @xmath6 @xcite , where a distribution of order parameter is appeared in an algebraic form with integer exponent . in order to be not restricted by such particular case",
    ", we introduce unified lorenz system with fractional feedback in section  [ sec : level4 ] .",
    "using this supposition allows us to describe subcritical regime of the avalanche formation in natural manner .",
    "the above generalization is put forward basis of section  [ sec : level5 ] devoted to consideration of avalanche ensemble . following famous edwards paradigm @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "an effective scheme addressed to nonextensive thermodynamics @xcite is proposed to be determined by a time - dependent distribution over energies of moving sand grains . to generalize the edwards scheme to nonstationary nonextensive system",
    ", we use the fractional lorenz system , where the avalanche size plays a role of the order parameter , nonextensive complexity is reduced to the conjugate field and nonconserved energy of the moving grains is the control parameter . within the framework of such approach , the phase diagram is built to define the different domains of system behavior as a function of noise intensities of above values . as a result",
    ", we arrive at natural conclusion that the power - law distribution ( [ 0b ] ) inherent in the soc regime is caused by noise of the energy .",
    "section  [ sec : level6 ] shows that this distribution is the solution of both nonlinear fokker - planck equation , which appears at studying nonextensive systems @xcite , and fractional fokker - planck equation inherent in lvy - type processes characterized by dynamical exponent @xmath34 @xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtain new relations between the exponent @xmath39 of the distribution ( [ 0b ] ) , fractal dimension @xmath40 of phase space , characteristic exponent of multiplicative noise , number of governing equations being needed to present self - consistent behavior in soc regime , dynamical exponent @xmath34 and tsallis nonextensivity parameter @xmath41 .",

    "locally the flow of sand can be described in terms of three quantities : the horizontal and vertical components of the sand velocity , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the surface slope @xmath46 .",
    "the key point of our approach is that the above degrees of freedom are assumed to be of dissipative type , so that , when they are not coupled , their relaxation to the steady state is governed by the debye - type equations : @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the relaxation times of the velocity components and the slope , respectively .",
    "( [ 1a ] )  ( [ 1c ] ) imply that the sand is at rest in the stationary state , @xmath52 and the equilibrium slope @xmath53 plays the role of a control parameter .",
    "since the motion of sand grain along different directions is not independent , eq .  ( [ 1a ] ) should be changed by adding the term @xmath54 due to liquid friction force along the @xmath55-axis ( @xmath56 being the kinetic coefficient ) .",

    "( [ 1c ] ) one obtains the equation of motion for the slope :    @xmath65    following the same line , the equation for the vertical component of the velocity can be deduced    @xmath66    note the higher order terms are disregarded in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and the renormalized relaxation time @xmath67 depending on the stationary slope @xmath68 is introduced .",

    "( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , are of opposite signs , while eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is linear .",
    "physically , the latter means that on the early stage the avalanche begins motion along the tangent @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath97 , @xmath98 are identical to those obtained within the framework of the mean - field theory @xcite . however , the magnitude @xmath99 is twice as little because our order parameter ( being the velocity ) is not reduced to the same ( the number of active sites ) in theory @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the outlined approach is that it fails to account for the subcritical regime of the self - organization that is the reason for the appearance of avalanches and analogous to the first - order phase transition , rather than the second - order one .",
