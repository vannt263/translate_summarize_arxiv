    "the scattering of waves by material inhomogeneities occurs in many guises and is most familiar through the reflection of light at sharp boundaries .",
    "the basic phenomenon of scattering may seem intuitive , but new types of scattering become possible when the inhomogeneity consists of a position - dependent velocity of the medium .",
    "the flow of the medium can allow additional propagating modes that are absent in the non - moving case .",
    "scattering into the additional modes may be accompanied by wave amplification in which energy is transferred from the flow to the wave .",
    "when this amplification occurs in a region where the flow velocity exceeds the group velocity of the wave , the process is analogous to that underlying the hawking effect at a black - hole horizon  @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous flow profiles and black - hole horizons can both act as amplifiers for waves .",
    "the quantum hawking effect  @xcite of black holes is due to the coupling of the horizon amplifier to the wave s quantum ground state , the latter being  amplified \" into real quanta or quantum noise  @xcite .",
    "both classical wave amplification and spontaneous quantum emission can occur in inhomogeneous flows and several theoretical proposals have now been investigated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the hawking effect in moving media differs most significantly from the astrophysical case in the essential role played by dispersion .",
    "the lack of short - wavelength dispersion for waves in space - time renders the astrophysical hawking effect somewhat singular , as its derivation features infinite wavelength shifts at the horizon  @xcite . for waves in material media , dispersion necessarily limits the wavelength shifts and the hawking effect has no unphysical features  @xcite .",
    "dispersion has been shown to alter the spectrum of hawking radiation from the original thermal result for black holes  @xcite .",
    "in general the spectrum of quantum hawking emission depends on the dispersion and the shape of the flow profile .",
    "moreover a flow velocity that exceeds the group velocity of the wave is not necessary for measurable wave amplification to occur  @xcite .",
    "waves in moving media thus offer a rich theoretical and experimental arena where the quantitative dependence of the hawking effect on dispersion and flow profile can be explored .",
    "a less welcome effect of dispersion is to make wave scattering in the experimental systems very difficult to solve analytically .",
    "the most accessible experimental system to date uses surface waves on flowing water , where hawking amplification of classical incident waves has been observed  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of water waves is complicated , with regions of normal dispersion ( @xmath0 in the fluid frame ) and anomalous dispersion ( @xmath1 in the fluid frame ) giving various types of horizon effects  @xcite .",
    "the system most studied theoretically is sound waves in a flowing bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , and experiments with becs have detected quantum hawking emission of phonons  @xcite .",
    "a fourth - order dispersion relation is widely used to model the bec system  @xcite , and a polynomial dispersion relation can also be used in a simple model for water waves .",
    "the resulting wave equations have not been exactly solved for an inhomogeneous flow and theoretical predictions of the hawking effect in these systems are based on approximate analytical techniques and numerical simulations  @xcite .    here",
    "we give the exact solution for wave scattering in a flow whose velocity changes linearly with position , where we use a simple bec model featuring a fourth - order anomalous dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional linear flow profile has regions of positive and negative flow velocity , so there are two horizons , one for left - moving and one for right - moving waves .",
    "the flow is thus analogous to a black - hole or white - hole binary ( depending on the sign of the velocity gradient ) .",
    "a linear flow profile is often assumed in the neighbourhood of a single horizon , and approximate treatments of this case using the same techniques employed here were given in  @xcite .",
    "but the exact treatment of the linear profile necessarily involves two horizons .",
    "on the other hand , the wave scattering does not depend on the profile being linear at large distances , so that the scattering coefficients obtained here are also valid for profiles that slowly change from linear to flat far from the horizons .",
    "the linear flow profile in the dispersionless case gives an effective space - time metric for waves that corresponds to a patch of de sitter space , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work , busch and",
    "parentani studied dispersive fields in de sitter space and in a cosmological context considered the dispersive wave equation used here .",
    "these authors derived the scattering amplitudes ( [ s12])([s42 ] ) below by a somewhat different method . here",
    "we provide more details on the exact wave solution and its asymptotics . also , our focus here is on laboratory systems rather than cosmology .",
    "the linear flow profile is not the example one would most like to solve exactly because it does not model current experiments , but nevertheless it gives some interesting lessons .",
    "the results highlight the importance of _ reflection _ , the familiar conversion of right - moving waves to left - moving and vice versa , where left / right motion here refers to the velocity relative to the fluid . scattering due",
    "to reflection in inhomogeneous flows has until recently been of secondary interest in studies of hawking amplification , but reflection occurs in the experimental systems and its magnitude affects the spectrum of quantum hawking emission  @xcite .",
    "for theoretical purposes , dispersion can be implemented in a manner that does not give reflection , so that the left- and right - moving waves do not mix  @xcite , but this possibility is not realised in the experimental systems .    for wave equations in spatially inhomogeneous media ,",
    "the exact solution for a linearly changing profile is the basis for the wkb approximation for arbitrary profiles  @xcite . in optics and quantum mechanics the solutions in question are the two airy functions , valid for a linearly changing permittivity or potential . for the wave equation in a linearly inhomogeneous flow",
    "we will obtain four solutions , rather than two , and importantly they depend on the dispersion .",
    "our solutions do not therefore have the same universal significance for inhomogeneous flows as the airy functions have in optics and quantum mechanics , rather they are specific to the dispersion of the bec model .",
    "the model equation used together with a general description of the propagating modes is given in section  [ sec : wave ] . in section  [ sec : ksol ] the wave equation is fourier transformed and solved exactly in @xmath2-space .",
    "section  [ sec:4sols ] presents the lengthiest part of the analysis , in which four independent solutions of the wave equation are defined and their meaning in terms of mode scattering is elucidated . in section",
    "[ sec : scat ] solutions are constructed that represent the scattering of single incident modes and the exact scattering coefficients are calculated .",
    "the final results are contained in ( [ s12])([s42 ] ) and ( [ s2s3a])([s2s3b ] ) , and are visually represented in figs .  [ fig:2 in ] and  [ fig:3 in ] .",

    "we take ( [ wave ] ) as our model wave equation in a dispersive fluid .",
    "the central problem is to solve ( [ wave ] ) as a classical wave equation , as this determines the mode expansion for @xmath6 as a classical or quantum field . in particular , the hawking effect in this system is at root a classical scattering effect for waves satisfying ( [ wave ] ) .",

    "[ fig : rays ] , where the rays for @xmath15 waves are plotted in the non - dispersive case .",

    "similarly the two right - movers ( relative to the fluid ) , one of which has a negative co - moving frequency , are funnelled to the horizon at @xmath27 and infinitely blue - shifted .",
    "this flow profile corresponds to a white - hole binary , i.e.  two 1 + 1-dimensional white holes facing each other . by reversing the direction of time ( or reading the ray plot from top to bottom ) a black - hole binary",
    "is obtained .",
    "the anomalous dispersion in the wave equation ( [ mono ] ) limits the blue - shifting at the horizons and redirects the blue - shifted left- and right - movers into the respective white holes , as also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rays ] .",
    "this behaviour can be understood by looking at the dispersion relation at different point in the flow , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] .",
    "as noted above , there are four propagating modes @xmath14 in the flow , labeled 1 to 4 in the bottom ray plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rays ] and in the graphical solutions for these modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] . modes 1 and 2 are the usual left- and right - moving @xmath15 waves that would be present in a nonmoving fluid ( @xmath29 ) ; these modes have positive frequency in a frame co - moving with the fluid .",
    "the motion of the fluid has the remarkable effect of making modes 3 and 4 into propagating @xmath15 waves , despite their having a negative co - moving frequency @xmath17 .",
    "modes 3 and 4 have complex wave - vectors in the region between the horizons , with mode 3 exponentially increasing with @xmath12 in this region and mode 4 exponentially decreasing with @xmath12 .",
    "it is not visually apparent from figs .",
    "[ fig : rays ] and  [ fig : disp ] how to follow modes 3 and 4 through the region where their wave - vectors are complex and identify which is mode 3 and which is mode 4 when they again become propagating .",
    "the identification follows from the four exact roots of the quartic dispersion relation ( [ disprel ] ) and a choice of branch cuts in these roots .",
    "modes 3 and 4 coincide at two points in the flow , as is clear from the bottom ray plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rays ] ; these modes are thus converted into each other in a continuous manner by the flow .",
    "rays move at the group velocity @xmath30 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] explains the reversal of group velocity as modes 3 and 4 are converted into each other .",
    "note also that when mode 4 propagates in the left - hand region of the flow its phase ( @xmath31 ) and group ( @xmath30 ) velocities are in opposite directions , and similarly for mode 3 in the right - hand region .",
    "mixing of modes 3 and 4 occurs at the level of ray tracing and is therefore visible in the bottom ray plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rays ] .",
    "in addition , there is also wave scattering of each of the four modes into the other three modes because of a breakdown of geometrical optics near the horizons .",
    "our goal is to calculate the exact scattering coefficients .",
    "the scattering of modes 1 and 2 , with positive co - moving frequency , into modes 3 and 4 , which have negative co - moving frequency , is accompanied by wave amplification and is the underlying mechanism of the hawking effect  @xcite .",
    "modes 3 and 4 scatter into modes 1 and 2 with a similar amplification effect .",
    "the wave amplification can be partly understood in terms of the conserved quantities associated with the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) .",
    "as detailed in appendix  [ app : conserved ] , there is a conserved norm , associated with @xmath32 symmetry of the action giving ( [ wave ] ) , and a conserved pseudo - energy associated with its time - translation invariance .",
    "the sign of the norm and pseudo - energy of each mode is given by the sign of its co - moving frequency ( see appendix  [ app : asymptotic ] ) .",
    "when a mode with positive co - moving frequency scatters into a mode with negative co - moving frequency , the total norm can only be conserved if the original mode _ increases _ its norm .",
    "there is thus an amplification of the wave excitation in the system .",
    "this occurs with conservation of pseudo - energy , but in the real physical system the energy of the wave has increased while energy is removed from the fluid motion ( this corresponds to evaporation of black holes  @xcite ) .",
    "a complete treatment of the physics involved would require a full account of back - reaction on the fluid together with the resulting energy transfer from the flow to the wave , but in ( [ wave ] ) the fluid appears simply as an external field @xmath4 . in actual experiments the amplification effect is so small that ignoring back - reaction in theoretical predictions is justified .    in order for the notion of scattering coefficients to make sense",
    "it is necessary for the waves in the asymptotic regions @xmath33 to reduce to non - interacting superpositions of waves associated with the four roots of the dispersion relation and their corresponding rays . in discussing the  modes \" labeled 1 to 4 above",
    ", we have implicitly assumed the validity of such a picture .",
    "if the flow has constant velocity in the asymptotic regions @xmath33 , it is clear the waves will asymptotically become superpositions of non - interacting plane waves given by the dispersion relation . for the linear profile ( [ flow ] ) , however , it is not immediately obvious that the breakdown of geometrical optics is confined to the horizon regions , since the profile has the same rate of change at all points @xmath12 and there are rays whose wavelengths grow longer as @xmath34 increases ( mode 2 on the left and mode 1 on the right ) .",
    "nevertheless , waves in the linear profile in the regions @xmath33 do reduce to non - interacting superpositions whose components are associated with the roots of the dispersion relation and their corresponding rays .",
    "this is shown in appendix  [ app : asymptotic ] , where it is also found that the low-@xmath2 asymptotic modes do not have the same dependence on @xmath4 as they do for asymptotically constant flows .",
    "( this last fact contrasts with the optical and quantum mechanical case , where the wkb solutions for the linear profile have exactly the same dependence on the profile function as for asymptotically constant profiles  @xcite . ) the flow regions on the far left and far right are thus places where we can legitimately speak of input and output waves and compute well - defined scattering coefficients .",
    "we express the monochromatic wave @xmath35 by a fourier representation @xmath36 where we allow any contour @xmath37 in the complex @xmath2-plane such that the integral converges and @xmath38 vanishes at the endpoints ( in practice our contours will run to infinity in the complex plane ) .",

    "there is no reflection because equation ( [ wave ] ) is then exactly the 1 + 1-dimensional wave equation in curved space - time , and conformal flatness of the metric tensor leads to a strict separation of left- and right - movers .",

    "the modification of the hawking effect due to dispersion is related to the amount of refection because the total scattering into all channels must conserve the norm .",
    "the precise relationship between the various scattering channels will depend on the flow profile , even when the dispersion is fixed . for more complicated flow functions @xmath4 than the one considered here , the scattering coefficients for the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) will also be more complicated , if indeed exact results can be found .    instead of trying to solve the wave scattering in a given flow profile ,",
