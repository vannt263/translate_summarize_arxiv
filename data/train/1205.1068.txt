    "<S> this was motivated by a question of todorov and vernaeve , answered in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> in this note we answer a question by todorov and vernaeve ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) concerning the relationship between the field of logarithmic - exponential series from  @xcite and the residue field of a certain convex subring of a non - standard extension of the real numbers , introduced in @xcite in connection with a non - standard approach to colombeau s theory of generalized functions . the answer to this question </S>",
    "<S> can almost immediately be deduced from well - known ( but non - trivial ) results about o - minimal structures . </S>",
    "<S> it should therefore certainly be familiar to logicians working in this area , but perhaps less so to those in non - standard analysis , and hence may be worth recording .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by explaining the question of todorov - vernaeve . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 be a non - standard extension of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath2 we denote the non - standard extension of @xmath3 by @xmath4 , and given also a map @xmath5 , by abuse of notation we denote the non - standard extension of @xmath6 to a map @xmath7 by the same symbol  @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath8 be a convex subring of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath8 is a valuation ring of @xmath0 , with maximal ideal @xmath9 we denote the residue field @xmath10 of @xmath8 by @xmath11 , with natural surjective morphism @xmath12 the ordering of @xmath0 induces an ordering of @xmath11 making @xmath11 an ordered field and @xmath13 order - preserving . by standard facts from real algebra @xcite , @xmath11 is real closed . </S>",
    "<S> residue fields of convex subrings of @xmath0 are called `` asymptotic fields '' in @xcite ( although this terminology is already used with a different meaning elsewhere  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the collection of convex subrings of @xmath0 is linearly ordered by inclusion , and the smallest convex subring of @xmath0 is @xmath14 with maximal ideal @xmath15 the inclusions @xmath16 give rise to a field embedding @xmath17 , by which we identify  @xmath18 with a subfield of  @xmath11 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 we have @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the standard part of @xmath22 , also denoted in the following by @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> let now @xmath24 with @xmath25 and let @xmath26 be the smallest convex subring of @xmath0 containing all iterated exponentials @xmath27 of @xmath28 , that is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal ideal of  @xmath26 is @xmath33 with residue field @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the definition of @xmath35 depends on the choice of @xmath0 and  @xmath28 , which is suppressed in our notation ; in @xcite , @xmath35 is denoted by @xmath36 where @xmath37 .    by an * exponential field </S>",
    "<S> * we mean an ordered field @xmath38 equipped with an exponential function on @xmath38 , i.e. , an isomorphism @xmath39 between the ordered additive group of @xmath38 and the ordered multiplicative group @xmath40 of positive elements of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we often write @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 , and the inverse of @xmath43 is denoted by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in @xcite ( see also section  [ sec : differentiability in residue fields ] below ) that there are mutually inverse group morphisms @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 thus @xmath48 is an exponential field containing the real exponential field  @xmath49 as an exponential subfield .    </S>",
    "<S> let now @xmath50 $ ] be the field of laurent series in descending powers of @xmath51 with coefficients in  @xmath18 , made into an ordered field such that @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath50 $ ] does not admit an exponential function , but one can embed @xmath50 $ ] into a large real closed ordered field , whose elements are formal series ( with monomials coming from some ordered abelian group extending @xmath53 ) , which does carry an exponential function extending the exponential function on  @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> there are several ways of performing such a construction , leading to different ( non - isomorphic ) exponential fields of * transseries . </S>",
    "<S> * one such construction leads to the exponential field @xmath54 of logarithmic - exponential series ( or le - series ) , introduced in @xcite and further studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another construction results in a properly larger exponential field , first defined in @xcite ( and also employed in @xcite ) , which is sometimes called the field of exponential - logarithmic series ( or el - series ) and denoted here by  @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> the following was asked in @xcite :    is there an embedding @xmath56 ( of fields ) which is the identity on  @xmath18 ?    </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this note is to give a positive answer to this question , under a sensible extra hypothesis on @xmath0 ; in fact , we show that then the structure on @xmath35 is even richer than suggested by the question above :    [ thm : main theorem ] suppose @xmath0 is @xmath57-saturated . </S>",
    "<S> then there exists an elementary embedding @xmath58 of exponential fields which is the identity on @xmath18 and sends  @xmath51 to  @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the hypothesis on @xmath0 is satisfied automatically if @xmath0 is obtained ( as usual ) as an ultrapower of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ thm : main theorem ] is a special case of a general embedding result stated and proved in section  [ sec : t - convexity ] below . as a consequence of this result , the embedding @xmath58 in theorem  [ thm : main theorem ] </S>",
    "<S> can be chosen to additionally respect the natural structure on @xmath55 , respectively @xmath35 , coming from the restricted real analytic functions ; see theorem  [ thm : main theorem , 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this embedding can further be extended to an embedding , also respecting the restricted analytic structure , of the maximal immediate extension of @xmath55 into  @xmath35 ( where @xmath55 is equipped with the valuation whose valuation ring is the convex hull of @xmath18 in @xmath55 ) ; see corollary  [ cor : main theorem ] . we should mention that fields of transseries , even larger than  @xmath55 , are constructed in @xcite , which also carry exponential functions which ( presumably ) make them elementary extensions of @xmath49 of countable character ( see section  [ sec : ctble char ] ) , so the embedding theorem in section  [ sec : t - convexity ] could be applied to produce embeddings of such fields of transseries into @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for another application of our embedding result , to surreal numbers , see corollary  [ cor : surreal ] below . )    </S>",
    "<S> the ordered field @xmath55 has more structure than that dealt with in theorem  [ thm : main theorem , 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it comes equipped with a natural derivation @xmath59 making it an @xmath60-field in the sense of @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by lemma  [ lem : t models tanexp ] and the remarks following lemma  [ lem : induced ] below , @xmath49 is an elementary substructure of both @xmath48 and @xmath61 , so if @xmath62 then also @xmath63 by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the exponential field @xmath48 equipped with a predicate for its subfield @xmath18 happens to be splendid in the sense of ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section  10.1 ) ( e.g. , if it is saturated ) , then there also exists a derivation @xmath64 on @xmath35 making this ordered field an @xmath60-field with constant field @xmath18 , such that @xmath65 is elementarily equivalent to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the following question , not addressed in the present paper :    suppose @xmath0 is @xmath57-saturated . </S>",
    "<S> is there a derivation on @xmath35 making this ordered field an @xmath60-field with constant field @xmath18 , and an elementary embedding @xmath58 of exponential differential fields which is the identity on @xmath18 and sends  @xmath51 to  @xmath28 ?      </S>",
    "<S> we begin by recalling the construction of the exponential field @xmath55 in section  [ sec : t ] . in section  [ sec : character etc ] </S>",
    "<S> we then show an embedding statement ( lemma  [ lem : embedd ] ) which is used in the following section  [ sec : t - convexity ] to prove the main theorem stated above . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : differentiability in residue fields ] finally contains some remarks on the functions on residue fields of convex subrings of @xmath0 induced by real @xmath67-functions .      </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath68 and @xmath69 range over the set @xmath70 of natural numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we use `` ordered set '' synonymously with `` linearly ordered set . '' </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath71 be an ordered set . </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath72 be the set @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are distinct and not in  @xmath71 , equipped with the extension of the ordering on @xmath71 to @xmath72 satisfying @xmath76 for all @xmath77 , and we also let @xmath78 be the ordered subset @xmath79 of @xmath72 . an interval in @xmath71 is a subset of @xmath71 of the form @xmath80 if @xmath81 is an ordered set extending @xmath71 , then for @xmath82 with @xmath83 we also let @xmath84 we equip @xmath71 with the order topology , with a subbasis of open sets given by the intervals , and we equip each cartesian power @xmath85 of @xmath71 with the corresponding product topology .      </S>",
