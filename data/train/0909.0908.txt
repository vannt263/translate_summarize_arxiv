    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the formulation of the littlewood - richardson rule in terms of measures .",
    "this is essentially the puzzle formulation of @xcite , and was also used in @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the linear combinations of dimensions which serve as witnesses for the possibility of reductions . in section 3",
    "we discuss a special class of measures , the tree measures .",
    "it was implicit in the results of @xcite that rigid extremal measures have an underlying tree structure , and this is made explicit here .",
    "section 4 reviews the construction of a puzzle from a measure , and uses the results of section 3 to deduce the identity @xmath48 . in section 5 we prove the essential technical result needed to show in section 6 that the analogues of the reductions of @xcite can indeed be performed .",
    "it seems practically impossible to describe all rigid tree measures in a uniform manner .",
    "we provide in section 7 a description of a fairly large class of such measures .",
    "we will give the description of the littlewood - richardson rule in terms of measures .",
    "this is equivalent with the puzzle description of @xcite .",
    "choose unit vectors @xmath76 in the plane such that @xmath77 .",
    "the points @xmath78 with integer @xmath79 will be called _ lattice points _ , and a segment joining two nearest lattice points will be called a _ small edge_.",
    "we consider positive measures @xmath80 which are supported by the union of the small edges , whose restriction to each small edge is a multiple of arclength measure , and which satisfy the balance condition ( called zero tension in @xcite)@xmath81 whenever @xmath82 is a lattice point and the neighboring lattice points @xmath83 are in cyclic order around @xmath82 .    if @xmath84 is a small edge , the value @xmath85 is equal to the density of @xmath80 relative to arclength measure on that edge .",
    "fix now an integer @xmath86 , and denote by @xmath87 the ( closed ) triangle with vertices @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for the lattice points on the boundary of @xmath87 .",
    "we also set @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the following picture represents @xmath94 and the points just defined ; the labels are placed on the left .    to at least three edges in the support of @xmath80 .",
    "we will only consider measures with at least one branch point .",
    "this excludes measures whose support consists of one or more parallel lines .",
    "we denote by @xmath95 the collection of all measures @xmath80 satisfying the balance condition above , whose branch points are contained in @xmath87 , and such that@xmath96 the numbers @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 will be called the _ exit densities _ of @xmath80 . _ _ the _ weight _ @xmath100 of a measure @xmath101 is defined as@xmath102 the equality of the three sums follows from the balance condition .",

    "these are precisely the triples of sets @xmath108 which satisfy the littlewood - richardson rule . the _ littlewood - richardson coefficient _ @xmath14 equals the number of measures @xmath101 with integer densities which satisfy ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "( see @xcite , or ( * ? ? ? *",
    "appendix ) for a direct proof of this fact . ) we will also write @xmath109 when @xmath49 are obtained from @xmath80 .",
    "when @xmath110 , we will say that @xmath80 is _ rigid .",
    "_ in other words , @xmath80 is rigid if there is no other measure with the same exit densities .",
    "note that knowledge of @xmath19 and of the sets @xmath49 determines entirely the numbers @xmath111 .",
    "the littlewood - richardson rule requires these numbers to be the actual exit densities of some measure .",
    "one of the advantages of this formulation of the littlewood - richardson rule is that it displays an underlying convexity structure .",
    "thus , the set @xmath95 is a convex polyhedral cone , and therefore each measure @xmath112 can be written as a sum of _ extremal _ measures .",
    "recall that @xmath113 is extremal if every measure @xmath114 is a multiple of @xmath80 .",
    "this decomposition into extremal summands is unique ( except for the order of the terms ) if @xmath80 is a rigid measure ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.6 ) ) . in the proof of theorem [ thm : rigid - skeletons - are - trees ]",
    ", we will describe briefly the result of @xcite showing how the extremal summands of a rigid measure are obtained .",
    "the results of @xcite imply that , given a measure @xmath101 with exit densities @xmath111 , there exist hermitian @xmath115 matrices @xmath116 such that @xmath117 , and the eigenvalues of @xmath116 are , respectively , the numbers@xmath118 here @xmath119 denotes the @xmath115 identity matrix . the sum of the traces of @xmath116 must then be @xmath120 , and this can be written in the equivalent form@xmath121    as seen in the introduction , the possibility of reductions for the schubert intersection problem defined by the sets @xmath12 is tested by calculating an appropriate sum of the indices in these sets .",
    "we are now ready to discuss these sums in full generality .",
    "assume therefore that @xmath2 is fixed , @xmath12 and @xmath122 are sets of cardinality @xmath2 such that @xmath17 and @xmath123 .",
    "let us set @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "choose measures @xmath126 such that @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath49 ( resp .",
    "@xmath57 ) are derived from @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath129 ) via ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath130 ( resp .",
    "@xmath131 the exit densities of @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath129 ) .",
    "the sum we are interested in is@xmath132 observe that @xmath133 depends only on the exit densities of @xmath80 and @xmath129 , and therefore it can be calculated directly from the sets @xmath49 and @xmath57 .",
    "the general reduction will proceed as follows .",
    "assume that we want to solve the schubert problem associated to a measure @xmath101 .",
    "we calculate the sum @xmath133 for a certain kind of measure @xmath129 ( a rigid tree measure in the terminology introduced below ) .",
    "if this sum is equal to @xmath134 , then one can effectively reduce the intersection problem to solving first an intersection problem for a stretched version of @xmath129 , followed by the intersection problem for @xmath135 , for which we have @xmath136 ; see theorem [ thm : reduction - procedure ] .",
    "the problem corresponding to the stretched version of @xmath129 can be solved algorithmically , as seen in @xcite .    since @xmath137",
    ", we can rewrite@xmath138.\\ ] ] we have seen earlier that the sum inside the brackets is equal to zero , and thus@xmath139 this formula has several advantages : it does not depend explicitly on @xmath2 , and by including the branch points of @xmath80 and @xmath129 in a triangle of a different size we do not alter the sum .",
    "more precisely , if we enlarge the triangle containing the branch points of the measures , the value of @xmath2 changes , but the _ nonzero _ values @xmath140 remain the same , and they appear in the same order , leaving the sum @xmath133 unchanged .",
    "the arguments in the remainder of the paper are easier to visualize when all the branch points are contained in the interior of @xmath87 , and the reader is free to make this additional assumption at any point .",
    "another change which does not affect the value of @xmath133 is homothety .",
    "denote by @xmath18 and @xmath141 the supports of @xmath80 and @xmath129 , and let @xmath142 be a positive integer .",
    "it is then possible to define measures @xmath143 and @xmath144 supported by @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively , and such that the density of each segment of the form @xmath147 is the original density of @xmath84 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath148 .",
    "taking , for instance , @xmath149 , each small edge in the support of @xmath80 turns into two collinear small edges in the support of @xmath143 .",
    "it is thus possible to assume that for every small edge _",
    "@xmath84 _ in the support of @xmath80 there is a second , collinear , edge @xmath150 which meets @xmath84 in a vertex @xmath151 which is not a branch point .",
    "this is a formal way to perform an operation which is referred to as ` breaking an edge in half ' later on .    the fact that @xmath152 implies easily that@xmath153 in particular , when @xmath154 we have@xmath155,\\ ] ] a formula requiring fewer multiplications .",
    "some measures @xmath101 have an underlying tree structure which we describe next .",
    "we start with a special class of planar trees .",
    "we consider trees embedded in the usual euclidean plane such that    1 .",
    "each edge of the tree is a straight line segment of unit length , 2 .",
    "each vertex has order 2 or 3 , and 3 .",
    "there are only finitely many vertices of order 3 .",
    "these conditions imply that the tree is infinite , but it has a finite number of _ ends_. these are sequences of vertices of the form @xmath156 such that @xmath157 has order 3 , @xmath158 has order 2 for @xmath159 , and @xmath160 is an edge for each @xmath161 .",
    "we will require one more condition on our trees .    1 .",
    "the shortest path joining two different ends contains an odd number of vertices of order 3 .",
    "all the trees we use will satisfy these four properties , and therefore we will not introduce a special name for this particular species . an _",
    "immersion _ of a tree @xmath162 is simply a continuous map @xmath163 which    * is isometric on each edge , * if @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the two edges meeting at a vertex of order 2 , then @xmath166 , and * if @xmath167 are the three edges meeting at a vertex of order 3 , then @xmath168 , and the restriction of @xmath169 to @xmath170 preserves the orientation .",
    "it is clear that each tree has a unique immersion up to rigid motions .",
    "immersions are generally not one - to - one . a tree @xmath171 is endowed with arclength measure",
    ". given an immersion @xmath169 of @xmath171 , we consider the push - forward @xmath172 of this measure .",
    "thus , if we arrange our immersion such that @xmath173 is contained in the small edges of the triangular lattice determined by the vectors @xmath76 , then @xmath80 assigns to each edge a density equal to the number of its preimages in @xmath171 .",
    "the resulting measure clearly satisfies the balance condition ( [ eq : balance ] ) at all vertices .",
    "condition ( 4 ) implies that we can arrange @xmath169 so that @xmath174 provided that @xmath2 is sufficiently large ( so that @xmath87 contains @xmath175 whenever @xmath151 is a vertex of order 3 of @xmath171 ) .",

    "the following illustration shows a tree , and the range of one of its immersions .",
    "the arrows indicates ends of the tree , and the asterisk indicates where one of these ends is mapped by the immersion .        in the second illustration ,",

    "the spaces _ _ @xmath502 , @xmath503 , @xmath504 are called the _ attachment spaces _ of @xmath80 .",
    "let now @xmath505 be a second measure with integer densities .",
    "the measures @xmath80 and @xmath506 are said to be _ homologous _ if there is a bijection between the white piece edges determined by the support of @xmath80 and those determined by the support of @xmath506 such that corresponding edges are parallel , and incident edges correspond to incident edges ( the intersection point being the one dictated by the correspondence of the edges ) . if @xmath80 and @xmath506 are homologous , there clearly exist order preserving bijection @xmath507 , @xmath508 , @xmath509",
    ".    also recall that a lattice polynomial of a collection @xmath510 of spaces is defined inductively by the requirements that    1 .   for each @xmath299 ,",

    "then we have @xmath531    denote the exit densities of @xmath80 by @xmath532 , @xmath533 .",

    "denote the exit densities of @xmath143 and @xmath129 by @xmath130 and @xmath538 , respectively .",
    "we have@xmath539 for @xmath533 .",
    "theorem [ thm : stretchability ] yields a rigid tree measure @xmath540 , homologous to @xmath129 , whose only possible nonzero exit densities are @xmath541 for@xmath542 with analogous formulas for @xmath543 and @xmath544 .",
    "the set @xmath545 of cardinality @xmath546 has elements@xmath547 in particular@xmath548 with similar formulas for @xmath549 and @xmath550 .",
    "we deduce that the attachment spaces of @xmath551 are precisely @xmath552 now , the measure @xmath551 is homologous to @xmath129 , and therefore theorem [ thm : lattice - poly ] implies that the space @xmath33 in our statement belongs generically to the intersection@xmath553 relation ( [ eq : ixiell ] ) implies that@xmath554 with similar estimates for @xmath555 and @xmath556 .",
    "thus , by intersecting the spaces in the flags @xmath16 with @xmath33 we obtain ( after eliminating repeating spaces ) flags @xmath70 in @xmath33 with the property that@xmath557 and similarly for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note now that @xmath558 , and therefore it makes sense to solve the schubert problem associated with this measure and the flags @xmath70 . to conclude the proof ,",
    "let @xmath29 be a space in the intersection@xmath559 to see that @xmath29 belongs to@xmath560 observe that the @xmath561th element of @xmath562 is equal to @xmath563 , so that@xmath564 where we used ( [ eq : flag - incl ] ) in the first inequality .    when the measure @xmath80 is itself rigid , it was shown in @xcite that it is possible to choose @xmath129 so that @xmath351 , and @xmath135 has strictly smaller support than @xmath80",
    ". therefore repeated applications of these reduction procedures eventually yield an explicit solution of the intersection problem .    as an illustration",
    ", we will see how to deduce the two kinds of reductions mentioned in the introduction .",
    "first , consider a measure @xmath129 with @xmath364 .",
    "there are only three nonzero exit densities @xmath565 , and we must have @xmath24 ; see the first triangle in the figure below .",
    "the sum @xmath566 corresponds to the original reductions in @xcite , and a reduction can be applied when this sum is negative . the relevant lattice polynomial is@xmath567 thus yielding the formula mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the second reduction outlined in the introduction corresponds with a measure @xmath129 satisfying @xmath568 whose support is shown in the second triangle below .        there are now six exit densities equal to 1 , but three of them are @xmath569 , which do not correspond to attachment points . the others are @xmath570 , where the numbers @xmath571 are the lengths of the dotted segments in the boundary of @xmath87 .",
    "clearly @xmath52 , and@xmath572 this time the lattice polynomial is@xmath573    we conclude this section with an analysis of the measures in @xmath574 which do not allow any of the reductions outlined above .",
    "there are 11 extremal measures in @xmath574 , and all of them are rigid tree measures .",
    "their supports are depicted below .",
    "let us call these tree measures @xmath575 and @xmath576 .",
    "in addition to the equalities @xmath577 , the only other nonzero values for @xmath578 with @xmath579 among these measures are equal to one .",
    "these are : @xmath580 @xmath581 , @xmath582 for @xmath386 , and the three cycles @xmath583 , @xmath584 , and @xmath585 . an arbitrary measure @xmath586 with integer densities can be written as@xmath587 where the coefficients @xmath588 are nonnegative integers .",
    "note that @xmath589 , @xmath590 , @xmath591 , @xmath592 , and @xmath593 . a reduction is possible unless @xmath594 , @xmath595 , @xmath596 , and @xmath597 .",
    "observe also that @xmath598 , and this measure has the same exit densities as @xmath599 .",
    "thus the only intersection problems which can not be reduced with our methods arise from measures of the form @xmath600 for some integer @xmath601 .",
    "the measure @xmath80 is rigid if and only if @xmath602 the first ten of the rigid tree measures above correspond with the reductions considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this analysis can be applied , via the duality described in @xcite , to the analysis of measures @xmath80 with @xmath603 .",
    "the intersection problems for such measures can be reduced to duals of measures of the form @xmath600 .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for @xmath604 and @xmath605 , but with many more tree measures . indeed , for @xmath606 all extremal measures in @xmath95 are rigid .",
    "for @xmath607 there are already some extremal measures which are not tree measures , though their exit densities coincide with those of a sum of extremal rigid measures .",
    "an example is provided below , where all solid edges have unit density .",
    "the two resulting measures have the same exit densities , but only the first one is extremal ; the second one is the sum of three extremal measures .        for larger values of @xmath2 ,",
    "there exist tree extremal measures which are not rigid , and do not have the same exit densities as any sum of extremal rigid measures .",
    "the support of such a tree measure @xmath80 is pictured below .",
    "here @xmath608 , and the exit points are @xmath609 and @xmath610 .",
    "it is easy to verify that one can not find among these points @xmath611 such that @xmath612 , and therefore the exit densities do not majorize the exit densities of any measure @xmath143 with @xmath613 . since @xmath603 , it follows that the exit densities of @xmath80 do not majorize those of any rigid tree measure .",
    "the reduction procedure described in the preceding section requires knowledge of the rigid tree measures in @xmath95 , and one might hope that a complete description of these is available .",
    "we are not aware of the existence of such a description , but we will use theorem [ thm : sigma(m , m ) ] to study those rigid measures which have three nonzero exit densities on each side of @xmath87 . assume thus that the rigid tree measure @xmath101 has weigt @xmath62 , and nonzero densities @xmath614 in the nw direction , @xmath615 in the sw direction , and @xmath616 in the e direction .",
    "these integers must satisfy@xmath617 and@xmath618 by theorem [ thm : sigma(m , m)](3 ) . assume first that @xmath619 for some integer @xmath620 . the smallest value allowed by ( [ eq : weight - sec6 ] ) for the sum @xmath621 s achieved when the weights on each side are @xmath622 and @xmath623 , and that value is precisely @xmath624 .",
    "thus ( [ eq : sum - of - squares ] ) implies that the weights on each side have precisely these values ( in some order ) .",
    "similarly , when @xmath625 , the densities on each side must be @xmath626 and @xmath623 . when @xmath627 relation ( [ eq : sum - of - squares ] ) implies@xmath628 with equality achieved only when all the exit densities are equal to @xmath623 .",
    "it follows easily from ( [ eq : sum - of - squares ] ) that on two sides the exit densities will all be equal to @xmath623 , while on the remaining side they must be @xmath629 .",
    "we will now produce actual examples of rigid tree measures with three nonzero exit densities in each direction , and with all possible values of @xmath62 .",
    "a first series of examples is described in the following figure .",
    "the thinner edges have density one , and the thicker ones have density two , except for one exit density which is equal to three , as labeled .",
    "other such measures can be obtained by applying @xmath241 rotations to these measures , or symmetries about a horizontal line .",
    "another way to obtain new meassures is to change the lengths of the edges indicated by a dot .",
    "these lengths can be chosen arbitrarily ; here is an example of this procedure applied to the second measure above .",
    "the three measures above provide examples with @xmath630 and @xmath631 when @xmath632 . for",
    "larger values of @xmath633 one must continue the spiral pattern . a second series of examples is illustrated below .        as in the first series of examples , these measures can be rotated by multiples of @xmath241 , and reflected in a horizontal line .",
    "their shapes can also be changed by modifying arbitrarily the lengths of six of the edges .",
    "again , the spiral can be continued to yield examples with weights @xmath634 and @xmath631 for all intergers @xmath620 .",
    "some of these examples have versions for @xmath637 , though in that case there will be fewer than three nonzero exit densities in some direction . using duality of measures , it can be shown that the measures described above ( along with their rotations , reflections and stretched versions ) are the only measures with exactly three nonzero exit densities in each direction .",
    "thus , for instance , there are no rigid tree measures whose exit densities are ( in counterclockwise order , starting with @xmath638 ) @xmath639 @xmath640 and @xmath641 or @xmath642 , @xmath643 and @xmath644 ."
