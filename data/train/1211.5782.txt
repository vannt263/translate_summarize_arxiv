    "the presence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) anisotropy@xcite in low - symmetry magnetic crystals typically leads to weak ferromagnetism , as a result of slight spin canting in an otherwise antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state .",
    "another possibility is the occurrence of helimagnetism whereby spins are arrayed in a helical or spiral structure whose period ( pitch ) extends over several decades of unit cells .",
    "these structures have intensively been studied lately , and the interest stems from a number of factors . some dm helimagnets display appealing magnetoelectric or multiferroic properties@xcite .",
    "this enables the control of unusual magnetic states by electric fields and vice versa , and makes these materials attractive for spintronics applications .",
    "another major factor is that , in addition to 1d spin spirals , the _ ground states _ can form a vortex ( skyrmion ) lattice , as advocated by bogdanov et al.@xcite in a number of related models .",

    "the scale of energy set by an exchange constant @xmath11 mev is very convenient for neutron scattering experiments . because of the low tetragonal symmetry ( space group p@xmath122@xmath13 m ) the corresponding heisenberg hamiltonian involves an interesting combination of antisymmetric ( dm ) as well as symmetric exchange anisotropies which lead to a rich phase diagram . in particular , the strength of anisotropy is such that magnetic phase transitions take place at critical fields that are well within experimental reach .",

    "we omit technical details but stress the important steps of the continuum approximation .",
    "the major spin interaction is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath55 mev ) and sets the energy scale of the system .",

    "second , the nonflat spiral , calculated numerically through the relaxation algorithm , exists as a stationary point of the energy functional in the region @xmath151 .",
    "it is thus desirable to examine also its stability , and check whether or not there exist yet another critical field within the intermediate region , beyond which the nonflat spiral may cease to be locally stable .",
    "we have therefore calculated the magnon spectrum of the intermediate phase ( appendix a ) and verified that all eigenvalues are always positive .",
    "consequently , the nonflat spiral is locally stable within the entire intermediate region .",
    "this computation does not prove it is the ground state , but in combination with extensive numerical explorations of two - dimensional states that found no solutions of lower energy , it is a strong indication .",

    "it is , however , important to provide quantitative agreement with experiment . in particular , for @xmath329 and fields nearly parallel to @xmath3 , the intermediate phase would first appear at @xmath133 in the form of a nonflat spiral propagating strictly along @xmath24 but nutating around the @xmath27 axis , _ without _ reorientation of the spin propagation direction .",
    "a sudden @xmath328 rotation of the propagation direction occurs later , at yet another critical field @xmath330 , above which the minimum energy state becomes the symmetric spiral propagating along @xmath27 but nutating around the @xmath24 axis . in the absence of the weak ",
    "ferromagnetic energy @xmath267 , an explanation of sudden reorientation requires a detailed analysis of the of the energy term @xmath229 .",
    "* we assumed that the transverse component of the field @xmath162 points strictly along the @xmath27 axis .",

    "all other results remain unchanged .",
    "we have presented a rather complete theoretical study of @xmath2 phase transitions in canted fields of arbitrary strength and direction .",
    "we calculated the complete phase diagram and identified the symmetries of states in a number of different regions .",
    "for the fields applied nearly parallel to the @xmath3 axis , we confirmed the existence and stability of the intermediate phase that mediates the incommensurate - commensure transition and analyzed its properties .",
    "we identify this phase with an experimentally observed _ double - k structure_. by analyzing data on fields applied perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis ,",
    "we determine an out - of - plane anisotropy parameter @xmath156 needed to complete quantitative comparison with experiment . finally , our model accounts for sudden @xmath328 rotations that have been highlighted as a noteworthy feature of recent experiments .",
    "the work reported in this paper results from a long - standing theoretical investigation of spiral magnetic structures in dzyaloshinskii - moryia antiferromagnets .",
    "the theoretical framework involves a number of approximations : the replacement of quantum - mechanical by classical variables , ignoring inter - layer couplings and the replacement of discrete spins by continuous fields in a model lagrangean .    nevertheless , detailed agreement with experiment@xcite is now so extensive that the applicability of this model to systems such as @xmath0 may now be established .",
    "the only remaining discrepancies lie in the particular magnetic field values at which transitions between magnetic states take place .",
    "these discrepancies are on the order of 1020% , which is not much beyond experimental uncertainty .",

    "experimentalists are likely to find the display in the extended zone scheme more useful . * along @xmath353 the low - energy spectrum is linear at the zone center . moving towards @xmath255 it acquires two bands , an ` acoustic ' band with linear dispersion and an upper optical band ( higher bands exist that have not been resolved by the computation ) .",
    "the linear portion of the acoustic band is the goldstone mode of these magnetic spin states . in the limit that @xmath354",
    "the bands depicted here collapse onto the horizontal axis ; the next excitation is at an energy over 0.4 that lies above the top of the figure .",
    "* along @xmath355 the low - energy spectrum is quadratic .",
    "as @xmath125 increases towards @xmath255 the quadratic regions become small and the spectrum becomes nearly linear . upon reaching @xmath356",

    "we first note that the uniform spin - flop state @xmath186 , or @xmath357 , @xmath358 using the spherical parametrization ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) , is an more or less obvious stationary point that minimizes the energy functional @xmath359 , where @xmath100 is the potential given in eq .",
