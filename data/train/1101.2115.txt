    "in quantum information , an important task is the long - lived storage and remote quantum state transfer  @xcite of quantum information .",
    "there exist several approaches to the implementation of quantum storage , such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) based on three - level atomic ensemble  harris , hau , scully , lukin , lukin1,lukin2,hau1,liyong , liyong1 , nuclear spins coupled to electrons  @xcite , and polarized molecular ensembles coupled to cavity fields in superconducting transmission lines  zhou , liao1,liao2 .",
    "nuclear spin ensemble has the advantage that its transverse relaxation time @xmath1 can reach a second time scale  lukin3,t2 . in earlier works  @xcite ,",
    "the nuclei ensemble has been used to store the quantum information of electron spins , since the electron spin s decoherence time @xmath2 is in the order of ten milliseconds  @xcite , which is much shorter than the nuclear spins relaxation time .",
    "recently , the optomechanical systems containing micro / nano - mechanical resonators have inspired extensive studies in many aspects , such as the entanglements of the mechanical resonators with the light  mancini , knight , penrose , vitali , and even the atoms  @xcite , cooling the mechanical resonators through light pressure  meystre0,meystre , meystre1,vitali2,zoller0 , and the nonclassical states in the hybrid system  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the micro / nano - mechanical resonator s decoherence time @xmath3 is shorter  tr20,tr2 ( @xmath4100 @xmath5s ) than the life time of the nuclear spins .",
    "therefore , it is expect to store the information of the micro / nano - mechanical resonator in the nuclear spins .",
    "actually , the coupling between the nuclear spin ensemble ( or a single spin ) and the mechanical resonator tips has drawn much attention  rugar , sidles , rugar1,rugar2,rugar3,rugar4,rugar5,xuef both in theories and in experiments . an important innovation based on the coupling of single / few spins to the mechanical tip is the magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm )  @xcite .",
    "mrfm uses a cantilever tipped with a ferromagnetic particle producing a inhomogeneous magnetic field that couples the mechanical tip to the sample spins . by measuring the displacement of the tip with an interferometer",
    ", a series of 2-d images of the spin sample is acquired  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the spin sample is usually a spin ensemble containing a lot of electrons or nuclear spins , which could be excited to show the collective behavior .",
    "such collective motion could achieve the effective strong coupling to the nano - mechanical resonator ( namr ) .        with the above mentioned investigations about various hybrid systems concerning the nuclear spin ensembles and namrs , rabl et.al .",
    "@xcite explore the possibility of using the short life time namr as a quantum data bus for spin quibit coupled to magnetized mechanical tips , and the mechanical resonators are coupled through coulomb forces .",
    "this study motivates us to utilize the nuclear spin ensemble itself as long - lived data bus ( the spin ensemble also behaves as a quantum transducer  @xcite ) to realize the effective couplings among the namrs .",
    "the advantage of our proposal is that the quantum transducer has the life time much longer than the namr s .",
    "our setup is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where an array of namrs is coupled to nuclear spin ensembles , which are placed between the nearest two tips . each spin ensemble induces interaction between the corresponding tips , and the quantum information of the tips can be transferred from one to the another one by one .",
    "this dynamic process realizing the quantum information transfer physically depends on an controllable coupling among the three systems , two namrs and a spin ensemble .",
    "we will show that the double eit effect exists in our present setup , which plays an important role in the coherent storage of quantum information in this hybrid - element sub - system .    in the conventional eit effect based on the @xmath6-type three - level atomic ensemble on two - photon resonance ,",
    "a driving light suppresses the absorption of another light ( the probe light ) , and even makes the probe light transparent at the frequency at which the probe light should be absorbed strongly without the driving field  @xcite .",
    "an important physical mechanism in this eit effect is that the pump light induces an ac - stark splitting of the excited state . as a result ,",
    "the probe light is off - resonant with the energy spacing of the energy levels it couples to .",
    "actually , the eit effect analog exists in a system of two coupled harmonic oscillators one of which is subject to a harmonic driving force  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the coupling between the two harmonic oscillators will change their original frequencies , and make the absorbed power deviate from resonance .",
    "this reason is similar to that in the conventional eit phenomenon .",
    "we show that our proposed setup consisting of a magnetized mechanical tip coupled to a nuclear ensemble , which behaves as a two coupled harmonic oscillator system , can also exhibit the phenomenon similar to the eit effect in the system with light - atom interaction .",
    "we will study in details the double eit effect analog in a sub - network of the whole structure shown in fig .",
    "1 , a namr - spin ensemble - namr coupling system . in the low excitation limit with large @xmath0 ( the number of the nuclear spins ) limit , the spin excitation behaves as a single mode boson  @xcite coupled respectively to the two mechanical tips . in this case , the interaction between the spins and each tip is the coupling between two harmonic oscillators with effective amplified strength proportional to @xmath7 . in general , this three oscillator - coupling system have three eigen - frequencies ( taking account of the degeneracy ) . and we show that there are two absorption windows for the probe microwave field , with the absorption peaks corresponding to the three eigen - frequencies . in these two windows with normal dispersion relations , the group velocity of the microwave field is reduced dramatically .",
