    "the production and decays of heavy quarkonia have been widely studied using perturbative qcd @xcite . due to the large masses of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks",
    ", the production or annihilation of heavy - quark  antiquark pairs takes place at a much shorter timescale than the formation of the bound state .",
    "this makes it possible to factorize the transition amplitudes . in hadroproduction reactions , also the initial - state hadronic structure is usually expected to be factorizable from the @xmath6 production dynamics in terms of single parton distributions ; in other words , quarkonium production is usually taken to be a leading - twist process .    in the simplest approach",
    ", one takes the hadroproduction cross section to be a fixed fraction of the integrated @xmath6 cross section below the open heavy flavour threshold .",
    "this is called the semilocal duality model or color evaporation model .",
    "this model reproduces successfully the dependence of the cross sections on the center - of - mass energy of the collision and on the longitudinal momentum of the quarkonium @xcite . however , many observables such as the relative production rates of different charmonium states , transverse momentum distributions , and quarkonium polarization are not predicted . in a more sophisticated approach ,",
    "a color - singlet @xmath6 pair with the appropriate @xmath7 quantum numbers is produced in the hard process .",
    "the quarkonium production amplitude is then written as the convolution of a perturbative amplitude for the production of a pair ( the superscript `` ( 1 ) '' stands for a color - singlet configuration ) and a nonrelativistic wave function .",
    "this model , in which only the leading , color - singlet fock component of the quarkonium wave function is taken into account , is called the color singlet model or charmonium model .    in the color singlet model , the polarization of final - state quarkonium",
    "is determined by the perturbative dynamics of @xmath6 production and by the angular momentum projection in the wave function .",
    "since polarization is relatively insensitive to higher - order corrections , it provides a very good probe of the basic @xmath6 production mechanisms .",
    "experimentally , @xmath0 polarization has been measured in fixed - target @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite reactions .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 in the angular distribution of @xmath0 decay dileptons in the gottfried - jackson frame has been measured to be in @xmath8 reactions and in @xmath9 reactions for longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 at 125 gev @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to unpolarized production .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that the `` direct '' and @xmath12-decay components of @xmath0 production have not been resolved in the polarization analysis .",
    "however , the polarization of the @xmath13 has been measured in @xmath8 reactions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 is also produced unpolarized , with for @xmath15 at 253 gev .",
    "apart from an overall normalization factor , the direct @xmath0 cross section is expected to be similar to the total @xmath14 cross section , because no significant contribution to @xmath14 production from the decays of higher - mass states has been observed .",
    "we therefore assume that the direct @xmath0 component is unpolarized ; the @xmath16-decay component should then also be unpolarized .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated the leading - twist contribution to the @xmath1-integrated cross section , where @xmath17 is the helicity of the @xmath0 , within the color singlet model .",
    "we included contributions from the direct mechanism and from the radiative decays of @xmath18 states produced in the reactions , , , and .",
    "the polarization analysis of the decay contribution is made possible by the electric dipole nature of the decay . in @xmath14 production ,",
    "only the direct mechanism needs to be taken into account .    the leading - twist , color - singlet contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath14 production turn out to be dominantly transversely polarized , i.e.  , with for the total @xmath0 and for the @xmath14 and direct @xmath0 produced by pions .",
    "this is in contrast to the experimental observation of unpolarized production .",
    "the model also fails to reproduce the observed relative production rates @xcite of the @xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 states . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we interpreted these discrepancies as evidence for important higher - twist mechanisms of charmonium production .",
    "however , one could argue that the discrepancies are due to neglecting the higher fock components in the quarkonium wavefunction .",
    "these are systematically included in nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , an effective field theory which has been formulated during the recent years @xcite .",
    "nrqcd provides an expansion of quarkonium cross sections and decay widths in terms of the relative velocity @xmath21 of the heavy quark and antiquark in the bound state .",
    "the nonperturbative physics is factorized into an infinite number of matrix elements that scale in a well - defined way in @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "color - octet mechanisms have recently been suggested @xcite as an explanation of the large quarkonium production rates observed at the tevatron @xmath23 collider @xcite .",
    "some of these rates exceed color - singlet - model predictions by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "there exist color - octet mechanisms of low-@xmath1 quarkonium production which are of higher order in @xmath24 but lower order in @xmath25 compared to the leading color - singlet mechanisms . they might help to reproduce the fixed - target data ; the purpose of this paper is to find out whether they do .",
    "if not , then the fixed - target discrepancies must be due to a breakdown of the leading - twist approximation of @xmath6 production .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , we already analyzed the color - octet contribution to @xmath14 hadroproduction at low @xmath1 .",
    "we found that the leading color - octet contribution is dominantly transversely polarized .",
    "hence , even with the leading color - octet components included , the unpolarized @xmath14 production data @xcite can not be reproduced .",
    "this suggests that there are important higher - twist @xmath6 production mechanisms .",
    "the @xmath14 analysis also applies to the direct component of @xmath0 production . in the present paper",
    ", we complete our analysis by calculating the contribution to @xmath0 production from the radiative decays of @xmath26 and @xmath27 produced through color - octet intermediate states .",
    "it will turn out that this component , too , is dominantly transversely polarized .",
    "furthermore , determinations of color - octet matrix elements from the analysis of other reactions imply that the magnitude of this component is small compared to the data",
    ". we shall conclude that in @xmath0 as well as in @xmath14 production , new mechanisms are likely to be important at low @xmath1 .",
    "at leading order in @xmath25 and at leading twist , the color - singlet @xmath6 production subprocesses are @xmath28 i.e.  they are obtained from the leading - order annihilation subprocesses such as by crossing .",
    "note that the process with the gluons on mass shell , is forbidden by yang s theorem @xcite . within the color singlet model",
    ", the @xmath6 production mechanism could be different from ( [ baier1][baier4 ] ) ; it could e.g.  be a higher - twist process , where many partons from the same initial - state hadron participate in the hard scattering .",
    "the radiative decays are known experimentally to be a major source of @xmath0 production .",
    "they contribute 30 - 40% of the total cross section in both pion- and proton - induced reactions @xcite .",
    "the production of the @xmath14 , on the other hand , is expected to be dominantly due to the direct subprocess ( [ baier2 ] ) .",
    "the polarization of a @xmath29 state like the @xmath0 is reflected in the polar - angle distribution of its decay dileptons in their rest frame .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 in the angular distribution is related to the polarized @xmath0 production cross section @xmath30 where @xmath17 is the helicity of the @xmath0 , in the following way : @xmath31 because of rotational and parity invariance , .",
    "we work in the gottfried - jackson frame , which is defined as the particular quarkonium rest frame where the beam momentum lies along the @xmath32 axis and the target momentum lies in the @xmath33 plane , with @xmath34 . at vanishing transverse momentum of the quarkonium , the gottfried - jackson frame is obtained from the laboratory frame by a simple boost , and the choice of the @xmath35 axis is immaterial .",
    "we analyzed the polarized cross sections of @xmath0 production through the direct process and @xmath18 decays in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we found that the color singlet model is insufficient to explain the existing fixed - target data . in the color singlet model , the @xmath19 and direct @xmath0 cross sections",
    "are predicted to be significantly lower than measured relative to the @xmath20 cross section , which is within a factor @xmath36 23 of the experimental value .",
