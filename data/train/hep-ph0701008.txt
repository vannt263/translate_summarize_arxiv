    "here we study the binding energy of a possible molecular antikaon , nucleon and nucleon three - body system .",
    "importantly , from a hadronic perspective , a bound @xmath5 can be at most reduced to a hexaquark , a exotic system . in a nuclear perspective , the deep binding of antikaons in nuclei has been predicted and are also actively searched .",
    "a bound @xmath5 would constitute a simple antikaon - nucleus system , the @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath5 can be formed with antikaon @xmath9 deuteron @xmath10 scattering .",
    "other exotic tetraquarks , pentaquarks or hexaquarks are also very plausible , but they are all harder to produce experimentally because they would need at least strangeness and charm .",
    "the several experiments dedicated to pentaquark searches ( where not only the kaon , but also the antikaon may interact with nuclei ) , or to antikaon - nuclear binding at rcnp , jlab , kek , dafne and at many other laboratories , are already able to search for the proposed @xmath5 . in particular evidence for @xmath5 has already been found by the finuda collaboration at dafne @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ production ] different possible production mechanisms are depicted .",
    "they are similar to the @xmath0 production mechanisms , except that the @xmath2 scatters on a deuterium nucleus , not on a hydrogen nucleus . the process in fig .",
    "[ production ] ( a ) is only possible if the width of the @xmath5 is of the order of its binding energy . the process in fig .",
    "[ production ] ( b ) is always possible , but is suppressed by the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "processes in fig .",
    "[ production ] ( c ) , ( d ) are dominant .",
    "the production process ( c ) should occur in experiments designed for the production of the pentaquark @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 has sufficient energy to create a @xmath11 .",
    "the production process ( d ) should occur in atomic kaon experiments , where the @xmath2 has a low energy but where a larger nucleus is used and the remaining nucleus may absorb the virtual pion .",

    "however the subtleties of these two - body subsystems require a precise computation of the binding energy of the three - body system .",
    "for instance the binding of the deuteron @xmath10 requires a d - wave component @xcite .",
    "moreover it is not clear yet if the @xmath13 binds in an @xmath14 @xmath15 baryon .",
    "notice that in the @xmath6 channel there is strong evidence that the @xmath0 is constituted of two poles , respectively dominated by the @xmath13 and the @xmath16 channels @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 binding is a very recent topic . while oset , toki and collaborators @xcite offer a different interpretation to the finuda peak , very recent theoretical calculations , fitting the @xmath3 scattering data with effective local potentials @xcite or with separable potentials @xcite agree with a relatively deep and wide @xmath5 resonance .",
    "here we specialize in the microscopic quark computation of the binding energy and width of the @xmath5 systems .",
    "section ii is dedicated to the @xmath4 and @xmath17 interactions .",
    "we compute microscopically the @xmath17 interaction , with a confining and chiral invariant quark model and using the resonating group method . in section iii",
    "we calibrate our interactions with the experimental @xmath18 data , and we study the binding and decay of @xmath3 and @xmath5 systems . finally we conclude .",
    "there are several very precise models of the @xmath4 interaction @xcite , compatible with the experimental @xmath4 phase shifts .",
    "all contain a long - range attractive potential , a medium - range attractive potential , an a hard core or short range potential .",
    "a picture consistent with qcd emerges if the long range attraction is due to the yukawa one - pion - exchange , the medium range is due to two - pion or one - sigma exchange , while the short range repulsion is dominated by the quark interactions .",
    "different models exist because the @xmath19 coupling is partly equivalent to the attractive part of the @xmath20 potential . moreover",
    "the repulsive hard core potential essentially pushes the wavefunction outside the repulsive core region , and this can be accomplished for different heights of the repulsive core .",
    "also , separable or local potentials can be used .",
    "however the @xmath3 interaction has not yet been modelled with the same detail of the @xmath4 interaction @xcite .",
    "notice that not only the kaons are unstable particles , with less experimental results , but also there are large inelastic coupled channel effects in the @xmath3 scattering .",
    "moreover , there is strong evidence that the @xmath0 does not have a single pole with width @xmath21 of @xmath22 , but two narrower poles , one closer to the @xmath3 threshold and another dominated by the @xmath16 channel .",
    "this leads us to compute the @xmath3 interaction microscopically at the quark level . here",
    "we assume a standard quark model ( qm ) hamiltonian , @xmath23 where each quark or antiquark has a kinetic energy @xmath24 with a constituent quark mass , and the colour dependent two - body interaction @xmath25 includes the standard qm confining term and a hyperfine term , @xmath26 \\ .",
    "\\label{potential}\\ ] ] for the purpose of this paper the details of potential ( [ potential ] ) are unimportant , we only need to estimate its matrix elements .",
    "the hadron spectrum is compatible with , @xmath27 moreover we include in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) a quark - antiquark annihilation potential @xmath28 .",
    "notice that the quark - antiquark annihilation is constrained when the quark model produces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . in the @xmath11 salpeter equation ,",
    "the annihilation potential @xmath29 cancels most of the kinetic energy and confining potential @xmath30 , @xmath31 leading to a massless pion in the chiral limit .",
    "we stress that the qm of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) not only reproduces the meson and baryon spectra as quark and antiquark bound - states , but it also complies with the pcac theorems @xcite .    for the pentaquark system , the resonating group method(rgm ) @xcite is convenient to arrange the wave functions of quarks and antiquarks in antisymmetrized overlaps of simple colour singlet quark clusters , the baryons and mesons . the effective potential of the meson - baryon system is computed with the overlap of the inter - cluster microscopic potentials , @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for the exchange of particle @xmath34 with particle @xmath35 , see fig .",
    "[ rgm overlaps ] .",
    "this results in an algebraic colour @xmath36 spin @xmath36 flavour factor and a spatial overlap . a convenient basis for the spatial wave - functions of the meson @xmath29 and the baryon @xmath37 is the harmonic oscillator basis , @xmath38    in what concerns the quark exchange diagrams , the spin independent part of the quark - quark(antiquark ) potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) essentially vanishes because the clusters are colour singlets .",
    "the only potential which may contribute is the hyperfine potential .",
    "the quark pauli exchange also leads to a positive , repulsive potential .",
    "importantly , each annihilation diagram can be related to an exchange diagram with the crossing symmetry of one of incoming baryon with the outgoing baryon .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ rgm overlaps ] ( c ) and fig .",
    "[ rgm overlaps ] ( d ) .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are opposite because the annihilation diagram does not have the pauli exchange minus sign of the exchange diagram .",
    "another important difference occurs , the exchange diagrams produce non - local simple separable potentials , while the annihilation diagrams produce simple local gaussian potentials .",
    "nevertheless all the different diagrams produce hard core potentials proportional to @xmath39 , repulsive in exchange diagrams and attractive in annihilation diagrams . notice that attraction may only occur in non - exotic channels .",
    "we summarize @xcite the effective potentials computed for the relevant channels , @xmath40 where @xmath41 are @xmath42 of the pauli isospin matrices for the @xmath6 and @xmath14 cases , and @xmath43 is a pcac factor , and @xmath44 is the relative coordinate .",
    "we calibrate our parameters in the two - body @xmath17 channels , where the diagonalization of the finite difference hamiltonian is straightforward . from baryon spectroscopy we get @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath46 is a pcac factor that suppresses the norm of quasi - golstone - bosons , consistent with the adler zero in the chiral limit , we get the plausible parameter interval @xmath47 $ ] mev . from the phase shifts for the first channel of eq .",

    "this is necessarily smaller , by a factor of 2 , than the hadronic charge radius which is enhanced by the vector meson dominance .",
    "to study the binding and decay of the @xmath3 two - body systems and of the @xmath5 three - body systems , we diagonalize the hamiltonian in configuration space .",
    "importantly , the decay widths to the channels @xmath16 and @xmath50 are accounted with the substitution method , resulting in an effective two - body @xmath3 separable potential @xmath51 . because the energy @xmath52 of our plausible resonances is above the pionic channels , the green function matrix elements are complex .",
    "this produces the decay width contribution @xmath53 to the eigenvalues of the schrdinger two - body and three - body hamiltonians .",
    "first we study the @xmath58 channel with the @xmath6 two - body @xmath3 system . using the pcac ratio @xmath59 , and solving the @xmath3 schrdinger equation in this parameter range , including the coupling to the @xmath16 effective potential",
    ", we get a resonance in the @xmath0 region , with binding energy @xmath60 $ ] mev , and width @xmath61 $ ] mev .",
    "this is distant from the single breit - wigner model for the @xmath0 resonance , with a width of @xmath62 mev @xcite and a binding energy of @xmath63 mev .",
    "we also consider an increase of the chiral coupling up to @xmath64 , to simulate the possible effect of other decay channels .",
    "maintaining the remaining parameter ranges , the resonance approaches the @xmath0 region , with binding energy @xmath65 $ ] mev , and width @xmath66 $ ] mev .",
    "this is reasonably close to the @xmath0 , possibly also close to its double pole models , including a slightly narrower breit - wigner pole closely below the @xmath3 threshold ( here we do nt address the second pole , since for simplicity we did not include the @xmath16 interaction , less relevant for the @xmath5 system ) .",
    "it is then instructive to find how much we can decrease the @xmath6 attraction , and still bind the @xmath3 system .",
    "excluding the coupled channels , the @xmath67 attraction is marginally sufficient to bind the @xmath6 system , up to a 1 mev binding energy .",
    "the coupled channel effects further bind the system and , even if the overall @xmath6 attraction is reduced by a factor @xmath68 $ ] , binding occurs .    in the @xmath15 channel with the @xmath14 two - body @xmath3 system , according to eq .",
    "( [ k - n ] ) , the @xmath67 attraction is decreased by a factor of @xmath69 , when compared with the @xmath6 channel . clearly , this small potential is far from being able to bind the @xmath3 onto a @xmath15 .",
    "we finally study the @xmath5 three - body system , using the nijmegen reid93 potential @xcite , together with our @xmath3 interaction and our coupling to the @xmath16 and @xmath70 channels .",
    "importantly , our two - body sub - systems only bind for isospin @xmath6 . for the @xmath4 sub - system we can either have isospin @xmath71 and spin @xmath72 , or @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the two different total @xmath75 systems are respectively the @xmath76 with spin 1 , and the @xmath77 with spin 0 . in the @xmath78 case , each @xmath3 sub - system is @xmath79 in a @xmath58-like @xmath6 state and @xmath80 in a @xmath15-like @xmath14 state . in the @xmath81 case , each @xmath3 sub - system is @xmath80 in a @xmath58-like @xmath6 state and @xmath79 in a @xmath15-like @xmath14 state .",
    "for instance , in the extreme case where the two nucleons would be superposed , we can use eq .",

    "the @xmath94 potential only depends on @xmath95 , including the tensor interaction .",
    "the sum of the other potentials @xmath96 is a function of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and of the square of @xmath99 . to span the possible quantum numbers of @xmath5 system ,",
    "we apply the total potential energy to a groundstate product of s - wave wavefunctions of @xmath95 and of @xmath100 . in what concerns the angular quantum numbers ,",

    "the other two potentials @xmath96 couple the groundstate s - wave product to wave - functions with any even power of @xmath101 .",
    "we address the binding of the three - body @xmath5 system with two different applications of the variational method . in the first method",
    ", we use a basis of laguerre polynomials in the radial variables @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath102 adequate to study weakly bound systems , together with a basis of legendre polynomials @xmath103 in the angular variable @xmath104 .",
    "we use up to 10 excitations in each laguerre basis and 5 excitations in the legendre basis , sufficient to get for instance the deuteron binding . in the second method",
    "we use a finite difference method , with 40 excitations in each of the radial variables , and 3 in the angular variable .",
    "the binding and decay width of the @xmath5 are determined from the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian , both in the polynomial basis and in the finite difference basis .",
    "it turns out that in the @xmath5 , @xmath105 channel there is no binding .",
    "the groundstate has binding in the @xmath97 coordinate , but no binding in the @xmath98 coordinate .",
    "in particular , the @xmath97 part of the wavefunction is localized and reproduces the deuteron wavefunction , while the @xmath98 part is extended over the whole size of the large box where we quantize the wave - function . in the limit where the size of the box is infinite , we get a bound deuteron @xmath106 and a free @xmath2 .",
