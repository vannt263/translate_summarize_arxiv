    "there has been renewed interest in riemannian structures of non - negative or positive curvature on the total spaces of @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 .",
    "these bundles have been of interest to topologists since milnor showed that if the euler class of such a bundle is  @xmath3 , then the total space is a homotopy sphere . until recently there was only one exotic sphere , the so called gromoll - meyer sphere ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which was known to admit a metric of non - negative curvature .",
    "then in their paper @xcite , k.grove and w.  ziller showed that every @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 admits infinitely many complete metrics of non - negative curvature .",
    "in particular , all the exotic milnor spheres admit such metrics . which of course begs the question : which exotic spheres , or more generally , which @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 admit metrics of positive sectional curvature ?    the berger space , @xmath4 , was first described by m.berger as a manifold that admits a ( normal ) homogeneous metric of positive sectional curvature .",
    "the embedding of  @xmath5 in  @xmath6 is maximal and irreducible ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is a rational homology sphere with  @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and it has the cohomology ring of an @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 . in @xcite ,",
    "k.grove and w.  ziller asked whether the berger space is topologically or differentially equivalent ( as a manifold ) to an @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 .",
    "part of this was settled in @xcite where it was shown that the berger space is @xmath8-homeomorphic to such a bundle . to settle",
    "the diffeomorphism question requires computing the eells ",
    "kuiper invariant  @xmath9 .",
    "the original definition of  @xmath9 in  @xcite requires that @xmath10 be written as the boundary of an eight dimensional spin manifold .",
    "since the cobordism group  @xmath11 is known to be trivial , one knows that any closed , 2-connected , 7-manifold admits a spin coboundary .",
    "however , an explicit coboundary for the berger space has not been found .",
    "instead , we use the analytic formula   for the eells  kuiper invariant due to donnelly  @xcite and kreck  stolz  @xcite , which is based on the atiyah  patodi  singer index theorem  @xcite .",
    "this formula expresses  @xmath9 in terms of the @xmath12-invariants of the signature operator and the untwisted dirac operator . to determine these @xmath12-invariants , we follow the first named author s approach in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; we first replace the operators  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 that are associated to the levi - civita connection on  @xmath15 by operators of the kind  @xmath16 .",
    "these operators are particularly well adapted to representation theoretic methods , which was first noticed by slebarski in @xcite , and later exploited in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the explicit formula for @xmath12-invariants from @xcite . as a consequence of this approach",
    ", we can employ the reductive connection on  @xmath15 to compute the secondary pontrjagin number in which is easier than using the levi - civita connection .",
    "this is accomplished by exploiting the existence of an equivariant  @xmath17 structure on the tangent bundle  @xmath18 .",
    "our main result is :    [ mainthm ] depending on the orientation the eells - kuiper invariant ( ek - invariant ) of the berger space  @xmath19 is @xmath20    note that for our choice of orientation ( which descends from a choice of orientation on the octonions ) the exact value we obtain is @xmath21 .",
    "by @xcite we know that the berger space may be given an orientation so as to have the oriented @xmath8-type of some @xmath1-bundle  @xmath22 over  @xmath2 with euler class  @xmath23 and pontrijagin class  @xmath24 with respect to the standard generator ( in the notation of  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , because the value of the @xmath8-invariant  @xmath25 of  @xcite equals  @xmath26 , it follows from theorem  1.2 of  @xcite by an explicit computation of all possible values of  @xmath27 that the berger space  @xmath15 is orientation preserving ( reversing ) @xmath8-equivalent to  @xmath22 if and only if @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) modulo  @xmath23 .    given a pair of 2-connected , 7-manifolds @xmath30 and @xmath31 , they are @xmath8-homeomorphic to each other if and only if there exists an exotic sphere @xmath32 so that @xmath33 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath34 is 6-connected ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , the @xmath35-invariant is additive with respect to connected sums and attains 28 distinct values on the group of exotic 7-spheres .",
    "the previous two facts were used in @xcite to do the diffeomorphism classification of @xmath1-bundles over @xmath2 .",
    "hence , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are oriented diffeomorphic if and only if they are @xmath8-homeomorphic and have the same @xmath35-invariant . comparing this with the values of  @xmath36 in  @xcite ,",
    "we obtain the following corollary .",
    "[ cor2 ] the berger space is diffeomorphic to  @xmath37 , the @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 with euler class  @xmath38 and first pontrjagin class equal to @xmath39 times the generator in  @xmath40 with respect to the standard choice of orientation on  @xmath2 .    in general ,",
    "any @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 with non - vanishing euler class  @xmath41 is diffeomorphic to infinitely many other @xmath1-bundles over @xmath2 with the same euler class .",
    "it follows from corollary  1.6 in  @xcite that the berger space with the orientation specified in   is orientation reversing diffeomorphic to @xmath42 ( orientation preserving diffeomorphic to  @xmath43 ) if and only if @xmath44 and @xmath45 is congruent modulo @xmath46 to @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 ; this was pointed out to us by c.  escher .",
    "note that there is no space @xmath22 that is orientation reversing diffeomorphic to @xmath51 .",
    "we also mention another consequence of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "it is a natural question to ask : what is the largest _ degree of symmetry _ for @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 ?",
    "the degree of symmetry of a riemannian manifold is the dimension of its isometry group .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the maximal degree of symmetry for exotic 7-spheres is 4 ( cf .",
    "however , some @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 admit actions of larger groups .",
    "it follows from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) ( see also @xcite ) , that apart from the trivial bundle  @xmath52 , the only seven dimensional homogeneous manifolds that have the cohomology of an @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 are  @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the unit tangent bundle of  @xmath2 , the berger space  @xmath55 , as observed by k.  grove and w.ziller in @xcite .",
    "the spaces  @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are diffeomorphic to principal @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the berger space is not diffeomorphic ( or even homeomorphic ) to a principal @xmath1-bundle over @xmath2 ( since its first pontrjagin class does not vanish ) , but it is homotopy equivalent to a principal @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 .",
    "[ cor3 ] up to diffeomorphism , the only total spaces of @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 that are homogeneous are the trivial bundle , the hopf bundle , the unit tangent bundle of  @xmath2 , and the berger space  @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s1 ] we motivate the question of the diffeomorphism type from problems in the geometry of positive curvature . in section [ s2 ] we compute the ek - invariant for the berger space using spectral theory . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we discuss the existence of independent vector fields on 2-connected 7-manifolds .",
    "the first named author would like to thank marc v.  leeuwen for his generous help with the computer program lie @xcite .",
    "we would also like to thank wolfgang ziller for useful comments .",
    "it is a general problem in riemannian geometry to find and describe closed manifolds that admit a metric of positive sectional curvature .",
    "there are few known obstructions and frustratingly , few known examples .",
    "the difficulty stems from the fact that all known examples arise as quotients of lie groups  as homogeneous spaces or as biquotients ( double coset manifolds ) .",
    "simply connected , homogeneous manifolds with positive curvature were classified by berger , wallach and berard - bergery in the sixties and seventies .",
    "the berger space evidently appears in the classification of normal homogeneous manifolds of positive curvature due to m.  berger @xcite .",
    "other than the homogeneous spaces of positive curvature there are some examples in low dimensions , but in dimensions 25 and up the only known examples are the compact , rank one , symmetric spaces .    the only way we know to construct examples of positively curved manifolds is to look at quotients of compact lie groups . by the gray - oneill curvature formulas , submersions are curvature non - decreasing .",
    "so one looks for positive curvature at the base of a riemannian submersion .",
    "however , all known examples of positively curved manifolds , except the berger space , fit into a fibration sequence , like the hopf fibration of spheres over projective spaces .",
    "fibrations may provide us with another way to construct examples of positively curved manifolds by the following method : given a principal @xmath59-bundle , @xmath60 , a _ connection metric _ on  @xmath61 is a choice of principal connection @xmath62 i.e. , a choice of horizontal space  @xmath63 in  @xmath61 invariant under  @xmath59 such that the map  @xmath64 is a riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers .",
    "the fibers are all isometric to each other and the metric on any fiber is isometric to  @xmath65 for some choice of left invariant metric on  @xmath59 . by hermann  @xcite ,",
    "every submersion metric on  @xmath61 with totally geodesic fibers must be of this form .",
    "now we look at associated bundles  @xmath66 with fiber  @xmath67 .",
    "we declare the fibers to be orthogonal to the horizontal spaces  @xmath68 , where  @xmath68 in  @xmath15 is the image of  @xmath69 .",
    "the metric on the total space is taken to be the orthogonal sum of the metrics on the fibers , where each fiber is isometric to  @xmath67 with a normal homogeneous metric ( or more generally a left invariant metric ) , and the pullback of the metric on the base .",
    "if we have a fibration with a connection metric , then the fiber  @xmath67 , which is totally geodesic , must be a circle or a normal homogeneous space of positive curvature .",
    "all known homogeneous spaces of positive curvature fit into fibrations with connection metrics , except the berger space .",
    "furthermore , derdzinski and rigas have shown in @xcite that for @xmath1-bundles over  @xmath2 , the only bundle that admits a connection metric of positive curvature is the hopf bundle whose total space is the round sphere .",
    "since we now know that the berger space is diffeomorphic to the total space of an @xmath1-bundle over  @xmath2 , it follows that its metric is not a connection metric . if one could find an explicit smooth submersion to @xmath2 , then we could check whether the positive curvature metric is a submersion metric . at the very least it makes plausible the suggestion that there are more general metrics of positive curvature on bundles with large degree of symmetry that are not connection metrics",
    "to compute the eells - kuiper invariant we use the formula @xmath70 due to donnelly @xcite and kreck - stolz @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 and  @xmath14 are the odd signature operator and the untwisted dirac operator on  @xmath15 , and  @xmath71 is a form whose exterior differential is the first pontrjagin form  @xmath72 with respect to the levi - civita connection .",
    "equation has the advantage that we do not need to find an explicit zero spin bordism for  @xmath15 .",
    "now we perform all the computations necessary to determine a numerical value for the eells - kuiper invariant  @xmath9 for  @xmath19 using the methods of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in section [ s2.1 ]",
    "we recall the @xmath73-structure on  @xmath18 , which will be important for calculations throughout this chapter . in section [ s2.2 ]",
    "we control the spectral flow of the deformation of the odd signature operator to slebarski s @xmath74-operator . in section [ s2.3 ]",
    "we determine the @xmath12-invariants of the dirac operator and the odd signature operator on  @xmath15 up to a local correction . in section [ s2.4 ]",
    "we adapt   to our situation .",
    "finally in section [ s2.5 ] we compute the remaining local correction term and obtain the value of  @xmath9 .      using schur s lemma",
    ", we exhibit a @xmath73-structure on the tangent bundle of  @xmath19 . using this structure , we will be able to simplify several explicit calculations needed to control both the equivariant spectral flow from the riemannian signature operator  @xmath13 to its reductive ( or `` cubical '' ) deformation  @xmath75 , and the chern - simons correction term .",
    "we will also use some branching rules for  @xmath76 ; these can be checked using a suitable computer program like lie @xcite .    to facilitate computations ,",
