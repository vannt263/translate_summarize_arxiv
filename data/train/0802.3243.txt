    "gathering information on metal abundance and abundance ratios of many galactic clusters located in different region of the disk and with different ages is mandatory to study the chemical evolution of the galactic disk .",
    "this , in turn , provides us with hints on the formation mechanism of the disk and its relation with the other major components of the galaxy , the halo and bulge ( janes & phelps 1994 , carraro et al .",
    "+ however , a frequent , well known problem in the study of open star clusters is the stellar contamination from the general galactic disk field , which complicates the analysis of the color magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    ". it also makes it difficult to derive fundamental cluster parameters , especially metallicity , when only a few stars are observed . +",
    "a notorious example in this context is the nearby old open cluster ngc  2112 ( collinder 76 , c  0551 - 0031 , ocl  509 ) , which has a reputation of suffering from heavy field star contamination ( brown et al .",
    "1996 ) , and for this reason its basic parameters remain poorly constrained .",
    "+ the first investigation on ngc  2112 was carried out by richtler ( 1985 , hereinafter r85 ) , who obtained photographic bv photometry for about 80 stars down to v= 15 .",
    "although his photometry barely reaches the cluster turn - off ( to ) , he nevertheless drew attention to this probably old , so far neglected cluster , and he suggested that ngc 2112 has a reddening of @xmath3 0.5 mag and lies @xmath3800 pc from the sun . by analyzing additional stromgren photometry , he proposed that the cluster had to be very metal poor ( [ fe / h ] as low as -1.4 ) . + a more accurate and deeper analysis",
    "was performed a few years later by richtler & kaluzny ( 1989 ) .",
    "they obtained bv ccd photometry for about 500 stars in a field of 200 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "additionally , they obtained moderate resolution spectra for a handful of bright stars .",
    "their conclusions were that the cluster was very contaminated by field stars .",
    "nevertheless , they were able to strengthen the suggestions of richtler ( 1985 , hereinafter r85 ) by confirming that the cluster is indeed old ( 3 - 5 gyrs ) , is located 700@xmath5800 pc from the sun and has a reddening of e(b - v)=0.60 mag . lacking a membership analysis ,",
    "no further information on the cluster metallicity was provided .",
    "+ photometry in the washington system by geisler(1987 ) and geisler , claria & minniti ( 1991 ) seems to confirm the previous suggestions that ngc 2112 is very metal poor ( [ fe / h ] as low as -1.3 ) .",
    "+ more recently , three spectroscopic campaigns have been carried out in the field of the cluster .",
    "friel & janes ( 1993 , hereinafter fj93 ) present moderate resolution spectra of 6 stars . out of these ,",
    "5 are considered members , and an average @xmath6 $ ] of -0.52@xmath20.21 has been found .",
    "this is significantly larger than all the previous determinations .",
    "brown et al . ( 1996 , hereinafter bwgo96 ) used the blanco echelle on ctio to obtain high - resolution spectroscopy of 6 stars .",
    "they accepted just one star as a definitive member , providing an even higher metal content value , [ fe / h]=-0.15 , only slightly lower than the solar value .",
    "finally , mermilliod & mayor ( 2007 , hereinafter mm07 ) enlarged the sample of spectroscopic members to 3 , out of 6 stars observed with coravel .",
    "they underlined the need to obtain radial velocities for a larger sample down to v @xmath7 14.5 to better probe the shape of the red giant branch ( rgb ) . at the same time",
    ", this would also provide much firmer metallicity estimates .",
    "+ in carraro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we reported a jonhson bvi photometry of the cluster down to magnitude v=20 . assuming the metal content found by brown et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we found a reddening of e(b - v)=0.63@xmath20.14 , a distance of 850@xmath2100 pc , and an age of 2.0@xmath20.3 gyr .",
    "we argued on a purely photometric basis that the metallicity can not be much lower than bwgo96 value , and we stressed the need for a new , more detailed spectroscopic investigation of the cluster .",
    "+ in this paper we attempt such an investigation by securing the deepest and widest field coverage multicolor ( @xmath1 ) photometry of ngc  2112 to date . at the same time , we provide moderate and high resolution spectroscopy of 40 stars . with these data at hand , we present robust and updated determinations of the cluster s basic properties .    593 , which has @xmath8 = 05:53:43.75 and @xmath9= + 00:23:56.4 . with filled circles",
    "we indicate stars observed spectroscopically . ]",
    "in this work we present photometry and spectroscopy in the field of ngc  2112 obtained with three different telescopes .",
    "for this reason , the details of data acquisition and reduction are presented in the next three sub - sections .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 images centered on ngc  2112 were obtained at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 1.0 m telescope , which is operated by the smarts consortium .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a new 4k@xmath124k ccd camera having a pixel scale of 0@xmath13.289/pixel , which allows one to cover a field of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to cover the entire cluster , which has an estimated diameter of 18 arcmin ( dias et al .",
    "+ observations were carried out on november 30 , 2005 .",
    "three landolt ( 1992 ) areas ( tphoenix , rubin  149 , and pg  0231 + 006 ) were also observed to calibrate the instrumental magnitudes to the standard system .",
    "the night was photometric with an average seeing of 1.1 arcsec .",
    "data were reduced using iraf packages ccdred , daophot , and photcal .",
    "photometry was done employing the point spread function ( psf ) method ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the covered area is shown in fig .  1 , while table  1 contains the observational log .",
    "+ the calibration equations read :    .journal of photometric observations of ngc  2112 and standard star fields together with calibration coefficients ( november 30 , 2005 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "now that we have determined the cluster s fundamental parameters , we can use the best fit isochrone as a tool to investigate possible binaries among cluster members from a purely photometric point of view . in fig  10",
    "we provide a zoom of the to region , and indicated with filled circles ( color coded in red ) radial velocity members .",
    "the solid line is the best fit padova isochrone ( see fig .",
    "the dashed curve is the same isochrone , but shifted up by 0.75 mag , to illustrate the locus of unresolved equal mass binaries .",
    "this exercise is suggesting us that several stars that lie off the best fit isochrone may in reality be unresolved binaries .",
    "in fact some of them lie very close to the binary locus , and we indicate them as filled squares ( color coded in green ) in the cmd of fig .  10 .",
    "they are stars @xmath14707 , 824 , 782 and 601 . at the same time",
    ", we indicated as filled triangles ( blue when printed in color ) stars which lie neither in the single star nor in the binary star sequence .",
    "these are stars @xmath14714 , 707 , and 323 .",
    "one may speculate that these are unequal mass binaries or maybe systems with more than two components .",
    "if we refer only to the to region , we are left with 14 single member stars and 7 possibly multiple systems , which implies a rough binary percentage of 33@xmath15 .",
    "in this paper we presented new photometric and spectroscopic data in the field of the old open cluster ngc  2112 .",
    "this new dataset allowed us to revise the cluster s fundamental parameters and clarify a long lasting debate on its properties , which for many years have been poorly constrained due to the high level of field star contamination .",
    "+ by means of multi - fiber spectroscopy , we measured radial velocity for 40 stars and found 21 radial velocity members .",
    "this , in turn , allowed us to clean the cmd , providing a better comparison with stellar models .",
    "+ the most important result of our study is that the cluster has a metallicity much higher than previous determinations , and somewhat higher than the sun .",
    "also the @xmath16 elements are marginally enhanced with respect to the sun , but still compatible with the trends of thin disk stars in the solar vicinity , as are all the other elements we measured .",
    "+ therefore ngc  2112 is typical of old , thin disk star clusters , as metal rich as the hyades ( boesgaard & friel 1990 ) , and located at less than 1 kpc from the sun in the anticenter direction .",
    "+ in addition , we confirmed the age of the cluster ( @xmath3 1.8 gyr ) , previously derived on a purely photometric basis ( carraro et al .",
    "2002 ) . as for the distance and reddening , our values are in agreement within the errors of previous determinations . +",
    "this study stresses the importance of performing detailed membership analysis in galactic open clusters in order to derive more robust estimates of their fundamental parameters .",
