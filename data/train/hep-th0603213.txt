    "in 1941 , stueckelberg @xcite proposed a covariant hamiltonian formalism for interacting spacetime events , in which the events evolve dynamically , as functions of a poincar invariant parameter ( see also fock @xcite ) . in the classical mechanics ,",
    "the particle worldline is traced out in terms of the values taken on by the four - vector @xmath1 as the parameter proceeds monotonically from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "stueckelberg s purpose was to ascribe pair creation / annihilation to a single worldline , generated dynamically by an event whose time coordinate advances or retreats with respect to the laboratory clock , as its instantaneous energy changes sign under interaction with a field .",
    "figure 1 is a reconstruction of the corresponding illustration in stueckelberg s paper @xcite .",
    "l  * figure 1 * : world lines +    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     first , the classical current density of the point events involves a delta function centered on the event , @xmath4second , the structure of the green s function @xcite , @xmath5for the five dimensional wave equation @xcite @xmath6carries these delta functions into the induced gauge potentials .",
    "third , the @xmath7-translation symmetry of the asymptotic events leads to a strong dependence on initial conditions that , under concatenation , should not be observable ; that is , scattering in the gauge field induced by the event @xmath8 will depend qualitatively on the value of @xmath9 , even though the concatenated coulomb field does not .",
    "a reasonable approach was found @xcite by smoothing the field - inducing current as @xmath10where @xmath11 is the laplace distribution @xmath12since the smoothing distribution satisfies @xmath13the concatenated maxwell current is not affected by the integration ( 580 ) .",
    "this approach leads , in the low energy case , to a classical yukawa potential , @xmath14 \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( { { \\frac{dx^{0}}{d\\tau } } } + 1\\right ) \\right ] \\simeq \\frac{1}{2\\lambda } \\left [ -\\frac{e}{4\\pi r}\\ e^{-r/\\lambda } \\right ] ,   \\label{610}\\]]@xmath15 \\mathbf{~}\\quad ,   \\label{620}\\]]with interpretation of @xmath16 as a cut - off in the mass spectrum of the photons mediating the interaction .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that replacing the usual kinetic term for the electromagnetic field strengths in ( [ 360])@xmath17with the higher - order derivative term @xmath18is equivalent to the _ ad hoc _ approach taken in ( [ 580 ] ) .",
    "this approach puts the theory into a form amenable to quantization and provides the mass cut - off which makes the field theory finite at all orders of perturbation theory .      by stueckelberg s interpretation of the worldlines , application of the classical coulomb case to elastic particle - antiparticle scattering",
    "seems only to require that the initial conditions of the test event include @xmath19 ( worldline @xmath20 in figure 2 shows an event evolving from initial condition @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , in two aspects , the solution to the scattering problem posed in this way seems inadequate .",
    "first , we notice that in the low energy case , @xmath22 , the lorentz force ( 610 ) takes the form@xmath14 \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( { { \\frac{dx^{0}}{d\\tau } } } + 1\\right ) \\right ] \\simeq 0\\ ; ,   \\label{660}\\]]and it appears that no scattering takes place .",
    "second , in modern treatments ( for example @xcite ) , based on the @xmath0 theorem , the antiparticle is characterized as a particle with the signs of all its additive quantum numbers reversed .",
    "following wigner , the quantum reflection @xmath23 , which both reverses the spacetime parameters and exchanges the past and future , is an antiunitary operator .",
    "since @xmath23 must be independent of any internal symmetries associated with generators @xmath24 , the antiunitary of @xmath23 requires that@xmath25 \\theta ^{-1}=-i\\left [ \\theta f_{\\mu } \\theta ^{-1}\\right ] \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\theta f_{\\mu } \\theta ^{-1}=-f_{\\mu }   \\label{670}\\]]and so all additive quantum numbers change sign for the antiparticle .",
    "however , in the stueckelberg theory , states are labeled by the parameter @xmath7 , which is not affected by spacetime inversion , and the argument is not immediately applicable to the event evolving toward earlier @xmath26 . it is not clear how this general reflection of internal symmetries is related to the dynamic evolution of the energy . for these reasons , we are led to reconsider whether the antiparticle differs from the particle only in the sign of @xmath27 . in this paper",
    ", we address these issues by examining the discrete symmetries in a formal manner .",
    "we take the improper lorentz transformations , in the passive sense , as reversing the orientation of the space and time axes .",
    "this approach is similar to the standard approach , but differs from the non - relativistic formulation following wigner @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which time reversal changes the sign of velocities , momenta , and the space part of currents .",
    "since velocities are @xmath28-derivatives , they transform tensorially under the improper lorentz transformations , and so time and space inversion are handled as coordinates on the same footing . reversal of the sense of motion , which is part of time reversal in the standard treatment , would be associated with @xmath28-reversal in this theory . however , since @xmath28-reversal can not be implemented as a lorentz transformation , we do not assume that the theory must be form covariant under such an operation .",
    "then space inversion acts as @xmath29and time inversion acts as @xmath30from the conventional observation that electromagnetic interactions are independent of the orientation of reference frames , we expect that the pre - maxwell equations expressed in the coordinates @xmath31 or @xmath32 will be identical in form to the equations expressed in @xmath33 coordinates . in order to clarify our method",
    ", we take a familiar example from maxwell theory , where form invariance of the coulomb law implies that @xmath34since @xmath35 is a scalar field on spacetime , we expect that its value at the point @xmath36 equals the value of the transformed field @xmath37 at the corresponding point @xmath38 , that is @xmath39therefore , @xmath40comparing ( [ p - coul ] ) with ( [ max_coul ] ) we notice that @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy the same equation , so conclude @xmath43standard treatments of the space and time reversal properties of the maxwell theory ( see for example @xcite ) study the field equations under the assumption of orientation invariance .",
    "however , since pre - maxwell electrodynamics emerged from the requirement of local gauge invariance , from which the classical lorentz force follows directly , it is more appropriate to begin with ( [ 510 ] ) .      under @xmath44 ,",

    "the requirement that solutions exist for the charge reversed case leads to an operation which reverses @xmath127 and the corresponding fifth - component objects , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the resulting charge conjugation operation , reverses the temporal order of events and the sign of the charge and related currents , leading to a negative probability density @xmath130 which only makes sense in the context of the current conservation expression ( [ cur2 ] ) .",
    "rather we associate the reversal of temporal order performed by charge conjugation with the re - ordering of events performed by the observer in the laboratory , who interprets events as always evolving from earlier to later values of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , charge conjugation exchanges the viewpoint of the events under interaction with the viewpoint of the laboratory observer .",
    "the inversion of charges ( associated with the gauge symmetry and any internal symmetries ) under this exchange reinforces the conventional view of antiparticles in the laboratory , but does not influence the event dynamics .",

    "the significance of the charge conjugation operation is that the reversal of quantum numbers is observed in the laboratory when the observer uses the laboratory clock as the parameter which orders the events .    in the context of horwitz - piron theory , the discrete symmetries of ( [ 90 ] ) were studied in @xcite .",
    "that study , which assumed the standard transformation properties for the four - vector maxwell potential @xmath133similarly concluded that while events interact without concern for the particle / antiparticle distinction , the @xmath0 conjugate of the negative energy trajectory is observed in the laboratory as the antiparticle ."
