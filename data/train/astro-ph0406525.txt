    "their importance depends on their strength .",
    "the large - scale galactic magnetic field contributes to the scale height of the galactic disk , and it confines cosmic rays to the galaxy , thus influencing the chemistry in molecular clouds . molecular cloud cores  thought to be gravitationally unstable without an additional support mechanism  have been supposed to be stabilized by magnetic fields , leading to the model of magnetically mediated ( low mass ) star formation @xcite .",
    "an alternative  although not necessarily exclusively so @xcite  model pictures magnetic fields as dynamically unimportant , and star formation being controlled mainly by turbulence on dynamical time scales ( e.g. larson 1981 ; elmegreen 2000 ; hartmann et al .",
    "2001 ; mac low & klessen 2004 ) .",
    "magnetic field strength estimates in molecular cloud cores thus might provide a way to distinguish between those two models .",
    "such measurements rely mostly on the zeeman effect ( e.g. crutcher 1999 , bourke et al .",
    "2001 , sarma et al .",
    "2002 ) resulting in an estimate of the density - weighted , direction - sensitive integrated magnetic field strength along the line of sight , and on the chandrasekhar - fermi method @xcite .",
    "the cf - method relates the line of sight velocity dispersion to the plane of sky polarization angle dispersion under the assumption of an isotropically turbulent medium whose turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energy components are in equipartition , yielding an estimate of the mean field @xmath2 in its original form as given by @xcite , equation  ( [ e : cforig ] ) assumes small angles around the ( required ) mean field direction .",
    "calibrations of the method with the help of numerical simulations of magnetized turbulent molecular cloud regions show that the cf - method on average overestimates the `` true '' field strength by a factor of approximately @xmath0 ( ostriker et al .",

    ". limited observational resolution ( mimicked by smoothing the simulated polarization maps with a gaussian ) leads to a further systematic overestimate ( hzmln ) .",
    "while the method is reasonably robust when selecting for small angles @xcite , it fails utterly for vanishing mean fields in the plane of sky , as expected ( hzmln ) .",
    "the latter authors suggested a modification of the cf - method which estimates not the mean field @xmath3 , but the rms field @xmath4 .",
    "the cf - method complements zeeman estimates to some extent , since it infers the mean field strength in the plane of sky .",
    "the hope is to actually retrieve information about the 3d structure of the magnetic field @xcite .",

    "@xcite decided not to use the cf - method because of the uncertainty introduced by the line - of - sight averaging of the polarization pattern .",
    "since the method relies on equipartition between the turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy , its application to other regimes than those dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence might raise some questions that we will discuss in ",
    "[ s : cfsystem ] .",
    "the goal of this study is twofold : first we aim at establishing how reliable the cf - estimates are for regions which are not dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence .",
    "we calibrate the method with the help of cores in a high resolution model of self - gravitating magnetized turbulence @xcite .",
    "we find that the cf - method returns on average reliable estimates ( within a factor of @xmath0 ) as long as the full angle information is used .",
    "single estimates can be off by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "the method is surprisingly robust even when it is applied to rotating and self - gravitating cores . despite its robustness , the method is subject to various systematic effects .",
    "second , we use the model cores to infer zeeman measurements of the field strengths and to compare those to the cf - estimates .",
    "while zeeman measurements are expected to underestimate the magnetic field in a turbulent region because of cancellation along the line of sight , we find that they can systematically overestimate the field in high - density regions with ordered fields oriented parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the cf - method in its original form rests on four assumptions : ( a )  the field perturbations are caused by hydromagnetic turbulence .",
    "( b )  the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energy are in equipartition ( this is guaranteed for alfvnic perturbations , see e.g. @xcite . ) .",
    "( c )  the turbulence is isotropic .",
    "( d )  the field is perfectly frozen to the ( total ) gas density .",
    "if one or more of these assumptions are violated , systematic effects will be introduced in the cf - estimates ( see e.g. zweibel ( 1990 ) , myers & goodmann ( 1991 ) , zweibel ( 1996 ) and crutcher et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a discussion ) . in the context of protostellar cores",
    ", two effects would be expected to play a major role :    \\(i ) the field perturbations are caused by other agents than turbulence , namely self - gravitation and/or rotation .",
    "first , we could imagine a core within the picture of magnetically dominated star formation : the core is permeated by a strong field , rendering the system subcritical ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence is assumed to be negligible .",
    "the field would be expected to evolve to an hourglass - like structure , which the cf - method would in turn interpret as an effect of turbulence , thus underestimating the field strength .",
    "second , let us consider a flattened rotating core seen face on such , that the rotation axis is more or less parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the mean magnetic field vector is oriented parallel to the line of sight ( this is the situation envisaged in the concept of magnetic braking of cores , see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the field lines would wind up , i.e. in projection they would describe spirals .",
    "these would result in large polarization angle dispersions not necessarily accompanied by a large velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
    "\\(ii ) for anisotropic turbulence ( see e.g. @xcite ) , relating the line of sight velocity dispersion to the polarization angle dispersion can introduce a systematic effect in the cf - estimate .",
    "however , if the magnetic field is predominantly in the plane of sky , the cf - method could still yield reasonable results despite severe anisotropy .",
    "the model this study rests on is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "it mimics a fraction of an isothermal molecular cloud region ( periodic boundary conditions ) , which is dominated by supersonic turbulence driven on the largest scales at mach @xmath5 such that the driving energy input is kept constant ( for a detailed description see @xcite ) .",
    "once an equilibrium state between driving energy input and dissipation has been reached , self - gravity is switched on .",
    "the shock - generated filaments start to fragment and form cores , the objects of this study .",
    "the initial ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure is @xmath6 . for a detailed discussion of this type of simulation and the choice of parameters",

    "cores selected for this study have to fulfill several criteria : ( a ) they are gravitationally bound .",
    "( b ) they are resolved according to the so - called jeans - criterion @xcite , given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the grid spacing and @xmath9 is the sound speed .",

    "although this ( excitation- ) threshold is chosen somewhat arbitrarily ( albeit guided by observational maps ) , other choices ( within reasonable limits ) did not affect the results .",

    "the medium can safely be assumed to be optically thin @xcite .",
    "we deliberately leave out any statement about the polarization degree as we are only interested in the polarization angles , but not in the ratio between polarized and continuum intensity . by this",
    "we intend to keep the argument as simple as possible , not embarking on a discussion on the efficiency of grain alignment mechanisms ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this simplification certainly limits our study to the investigation of polarization angles only . to mimic limited telescope resolution",
    ", we smooth the polarization maps with a gaussian filter as in hzmln .    the cf - method is applied to the `` polarization maps '' in the extended form given by @xmath72 where we replace the small - angle approximation by the @xmath73 of the angle .",
    "the density is determined from the column densities of the polarization maps , assuming a spherical mass distribution , where the radius is given by the geometric mean of the long and short axis of the core @xcite .    to infer a `` zeeman '' estimate from our cores",
    ", we integrate @xmath74 along the line of sight . @xmath75 and @xmath67 are the same as in equation  ( [ e : stokesparm ] ) .",
    "in order to establish the reliability of the cf - method for cores , we generated polarization maps after rotating the cores such that the line of sight is either parallel to the mean flux direction ( the `` worst case '' for the cf - method , since then the necessary mean field component would be expected to vanish ) or perpendicular to the mean flux direction ( `` best '' case ) .",
    "an example of the three - dimensional core structure and the resulting polarization maps is given in figures  [ f : core3d ] and [ f : coremaps ] .",

    "first , we note that using the small angle approximation ( open symbols ) leads to a systematic overestimate of the field strength by a factor of more than @xmath76 .",
    "this is not surprising since we discard physically relevant information about the field structure ( and thus strength ) when selecting for small angles .",
    "however , we can not restrict the line of sight velocity dispersion in the same way .",

    "this is not inconsistent with the findings of @xcite , since they selected for their whole domain and thus their results were not affected by small - number statistics . for large - number statistics",
    ", weak fields will lead to a wide angle dispersion , meaning that even when selecting , most of the angles are found at the largest possible values , thus indicating a weak field .",
    "the small number of strong - field cores is conspicuous .",
    "this is simply a consequence of low initial field strength , which renders the turbulent box supercritical by a factor of @xmath77 . on the one hand , this is inconsistent with the observations , on the other hand it allows us to test the cf - method under severer conditions than it would probably meet in observational data .",
    "the modified method to estimate the rms field in the core gives  within the scatter  the same estimated field ( fig .",
    "[ f : zwperformance ] ) . for smooth fields",
    "the method reverts to the original version , while for unordered fields , the method emphasizes the angular variations ( see hzmln for a discussion ) .",
    "the scatter of the estimates is slightly reduced .",
    "note that on the whole the rms field is somewhat larger than the mean field , indicating a non - uniform field component in the cores .",
    "figures  [ f : cfperformance ] , [ f : zwperformance ] and all subsequent ones show cores extracted at different times during the simulation .",
    "although we thus do not expect to be affected by selection effects that could result from chosing a special time instant during the simulation , there is of course a selection effect in the sense that we extract cores at comparable evolutionary stages , i.e. cores that are already self - gravitating , but still numerically resolved .",
    "as long as the cores are resolved , a correlation between reliability and global evolution time ( last column in table  [ t : cores ] ) can not be seen .",
    "applying equation  ( [ e : cfextend ] ) and preventing the angular dispersion from blowing up by selecting for angle differences @xmath78 improves the reliability of the estimates in these models .",
    "as hzmln showed for extended regions , limited telescope resolution ( finite beam width ) leads to a systematic overestimate , because the field variations are averaged out , making the field look smoother , i.e. in terms of the method , stronger .",
    "we can observe a similar effect in figure  [ f : cfperformancesmooth ] , compared to figure  [ f : cfperformance ] .",
    "degrading the resolution by roughly a factor of @xmath79 leads to an increased overestimate .",
    "the estimates selected for @xmath80 are less affected by the degraded resolution , and both selected sets of estimates agree for strong fields , as is to be expected",
    ".    it might be interesting to note that the ambipolar diffusion scale @xmath81 is on the order of @xmath82pc for typical core parameters .",
    "in equation  ( [ e : decouplingscale ] ) the field strength @xmath83 , the neutral particle density @xmath84 and the velocity dispersion @xmath85 are given in cgs - units .",
    "the ionization fraction is denoted by @xmath86 .    while figure  [ f : cfperformancesmooth ] demonstrated the effect of degraded telescope resolution ,",
    "we exemplify the influence of under - resolved cores on the overall result in figure  [ f : cfperformanceunres ] .",
    "the effect is obvious : the peak densities in those cores start to grow unhampered once they overstep the resolution criterion .",
    "the peak is concentrated in the central cell , so that the field is not able to follow the density evolution @xcite .",
    "because of the over - large densities , the cf - method systematically overestimates the true field strength , a purely numerical effect in this case .",
    "note that the overestimates correlate with the strongest fields and unresolved cores .",
    "the insufficient numerical resolution leads to a diffusion of the field out of the dense region , qualitatively similar to ambipolar diffusion . while there is no basis",
    "on which to draw any conclusions from these under - resolved cores ( especially since the numerical diffusion can not be controlled , and can behave quite differently from its physical counterpart ) , a similar effect would be expected in the observations _ if _ the density tracer is a neutral species .",
    "if the magnetic field is not uniform , zeeman measurements  realized in our models via equation  ( [ e : zeeman ] )  are expected to systematically underestimate the field strength because of cancellation by field reversals along the line of sight . at first glance , this expectation is not met ( fig .",
    "[ f : zeeman ] ) .",
    "the zeeman - effect seems to overestimate the field roughly by the same amount as the cf - method does .",
    "however , distinguishing between the lines of sight clarifies the picture .",
    "zeeman estimates taken along the mean flux direction  denoted by `` los=1 '' in figure  [ f : zeeman ]  yield larger values than those taken perpendicularly to the mean flux direction ( `` los=2 '' and `` los=3 '' ) .",
    "since the line of sight integration is density - weighted , fields at locations with higher densities tend to be emphasized .",
    "because of flux - freezing , this generally means that there is a tendency to higher field strength estimates in cores with large density contrasts , leading to a systematic overestimate for such cores .",
    "thus the estimates along the mean flux direction are dominated by the strongly weighted central field values , while the estimates perpendicular to the mean flux direction `` see '' the perturbed component around it , leading to cancellation .",
    "this of course holds only as long as the emissivity is ( approximately ) proportional to the density , as assumed in equation  ( [ e : zeeman ] ) .    comparing the cf and zeeman estimates in figure  [ f : cfvszeeman ] ,",
    "the picture is somewhat less clear for the cf - method .",
    "there is a slight tendency to a larger scatter for estimates along the mean flux direction ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ f : cfvszeeman ] , diamonds ) , as one would expect , since the method is expected to work most reliably for a strong mean field component in the plane of sky .",
    "unfortunately , this is a reliability criterion gathered in `` hindsight '' , i.e. it is not possible to apply it to observational data .    instead",
    ", we might be tempted to argue that for cases where the cf - method and the zeeman measurements yield approximately the same results , the field value should be well determined .",
    "filled symbols in figure  [ f : cfvszeeman ] denote estimates for which @xmath87 and @xmath88 agree within a factor of three .",
    "the scatter is reduced for both the cf - method and the zeeman - measurement , although we should note that the estimates could still be off by a factor of approximately five .",
    "it might be interesting to note that the overall scatter of the zeeman measurements around the `` true '' field value is actually larger than that of the cf - estimates ( fig .",
    "[ f : cfvszeeman ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : criticality ] demonstrates the scatter of the magnetic field estimates in terms of the criticality parameter @xmath89 as defined by @xcite , eq.(1 ) , namely @xmath90 where the magnetic field @xmath83 is given in @xmath91 g and the h@xmath92 column density in @xmath93 .",
    "the tendency of the cf - method ( squares in fig .",
    "[ f : criticality ] ) to generally overestimate the field strength renders the core ensemble slightly more subcritical than expected from the numerical values ( diamonds in fig .",
    "[ f : criticality ] ) .",
    "there are a few subcritical numerical data points ( diamonds ) .",
    "these are strongly elongated filaments with fields aligned in parallel , indicating field line stretching .",
    "although the numerical values already show a considerable scatter because of dynamical effects , the uncertainties in the cf - estimates as well as in the zeeman - estimates emphasize that field estimates of single cores allow only a limited conclusion about the physical state of the core .",
    "zeeman measurements and the cf - method are currently the most viable ways to estimate the magnetic field strength in the dense molecular medium . since the two methods are measuring different components of the field , they complement each other to some extent .",
    "the cf - method rests on the assumption of equipartition between turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energy in the medium , which is not necessarily guaranteed in regions dominated by e.g gravity or rotation , such as protostellar cores .",
    "we tested with the help of model cores formed in a numerical simulation of self - gravitating magnetized turbulence how accurately the cf - method and zeeman measurements can estimate the magnetic field strength in such cores .",
    "we find    1 .   that the cf - method is on the average surprisingly robust even in regions not dominated by turbulence .",
    "the previous overestimation factor of @xmath0 is still valid approximately for the model cores on the average , _ if _ the full angle dispersion information is used .",
    "single measurements can be off by a factor of up to @xmath1 in both directions .",
    "2 .   that applying the small - angle approximation in the cf - method leads to a systematic overestimate of @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   that the `` zeeman '' estimates of our cores can lead to an _ overestimate _ for integrations along the mean flux direction , resulting from the emphasis on strong fields from the density - weighted line of sight integration . for integrations perpendicular to the mean flux direction ,",
    "the zeeman measurements tend to underestimate the field strength .",
    "thus , zeeman measurements can not generally be regarded as a lower limit on the field strength .",
    "a major shortcoming of our model is its low field strength , which renders its regime less magnetized than observed in molecular cores .",
    "while this is definitely a limitation , we see it also as an advantage since the cf - method is expected to work more reliably for stronger field strengths ( hzmln ) . obviously , further limitations of this study stem from the limited resolution within the cores .    taking the emissivity proportional to the density ( eq .  [ e : zeeman ] ) in the zeeman estimates",
    "does not account for the fact that the tracer species do not necessarily contribute proportionally to gas density . in that sense",
    ", the overestimate inferred for the zeeman measurements from our models could be regarded as an upper limit .",
    "we did not address the problem of how to convert tracer column densities into h@xmath92 densities , which is very likely another major source of uncertainty in the cf - method .",
    "similarly , we left out a discussion of the velocity tracers .",
    "we conclude that single magnetic field estimates in molecular cores should be regarded with caution because of the substantial scatter .",
    "the cf - method works reliably on average and should be combined with other types of estimates .",
    "this study relies on the @xmath94 simulation @xcite calculated on the sgi origin 2000 of the national center of supercomputing applications at the university of illinois at urbana - champaign .",

    "<S> the currently most viable methods to estimate magnetic field strengths in molecular cloud cores are zeeman measurements and the chandrasekhar - fermi ( cf ) method </S>",
    "<S> . the cf - method estimates magnetic field strengths from polarimetry and relies on equipartition between the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energy in the observed region . </S>",
    "<S> thus , its application to objects not dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> we calibrate the cf - method and zeeman measurements against numerical models of self - gravitating molecular cloud cores . </S>",
    "<S> we find  in agreement with previous results  that the cf - method is on the average accurate up to a factor of @xmath0 , while a single estimate can be off by a factor of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the cf - method is surprisingly robust even when applied to regions not dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence and in the face of small - number statistics . </S>",
    "<S> zeeman measurements can systematically overestimate the field strength in high - density regions , if the field is predominantly oriented along the line of sight , while they tend to underestimate the field in other cases . </S>"
