    "we start with a simple stochastic model , proposed and studied in eugne et al .",
    "@xcite for which we consider extensions to get a deeper understanding on the intricate influence of each reaction considered . in eugne",
    "@xcite , rigorous asymptotics of the simple model were proved , and it was fitted to the experimental data published in xue et al  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the predicted variability was much smaller by the model than what was experimentally obtained .",
    "one of the conclusions of this work is that other mechanisms had to be taken into account to explain the variability observed in the experiments .",
    "we thus propose here two ways to complement the basic model .",
    "let us first recall its definition .",
    "one of the simplest models to describe the nucleation process considers two populations of chemical components : ( regular ) monomers and polymerised monomers .",
    "initially there are only monomers .",
    "there are two reactions for the polymerization of a monomer : either two monomers collide to combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the encounter of a polymerised monomer . the chemical reactions associated with the basic model can then be described as follows : @xmath4 these reactions can be represented by the sample paths of a markov process @xmath5 , where @xmath6 [ resp .",
    "@xmath7 is the number of regular [ resp .",
    "polymerised ] monomers at time @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath2 which will be used should be thought of as the reaction volume . in particular",
    "@xmath9 is the concentration of polymerised monomers at time @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the initial number of monomers , it is assumed that the following regime @xmath12 holds for some @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is in fact the initial concentration of monomers .",
    "the transition rates of @xmath5 are given by , for @xmath15 , @xmath16 the second coordinate @xmath17 is in fact the polymerized mass which explains the jumps of size @xmath18 in the reactions .",
    "note that the conservation of mass implies that the quantity @xmath19 is constant and equal to @xmath11 , the total number of initial monomers .    1 .   the first reaction of   converts two monomers into two polymerised monomers . in our model , due to thermal noise in particular",
    ", these reactions will occur in a stochastic way .",
    "following the principles of the law of mass action , the encounter of two chemical species occurs at a rate proportional to the product of the _ concentrations _ of each species .",
    "therefore two given monomers disappear to produce two polymerised monomers at a rate @xmath20 .",
    "the second reaction can be seen as an auto - catalytic process . here , given a monomer at the contact of a polymerised monomer , the monomer is converted into a polymerised monomer at a rate @xmath21 .",
    "again , by the law of mass action , regular monomers disappear at the rate @xmath22 .",

    "@xcite for a general presentation of these phenomena in a biological context . for more discussion and results on stochastic models associated to chemical reactions , see for example anderson and kurtz  @xcite and higham  @xcite and references therein .",
    "this simple , intuitive model of polymerisation has the advantage of having only two parameters to determine .",
    "it can be analyzed mathematically by standard tools of probability theory , see eugne et al .",
    "it has been shown that if @xmath23 is the number of polymerised monomers at time @xmath10 , then the polymerisation process can be described via the following convergence in distribution @xmath24 holds , where @xmath25 is the non - trivial solution of the following simple ordinary differential equation @xmath26 converging to @xmath27 has @xmath10 goes to infinity .    by using these simple mathematical results and the data from experiments with 17 different concentrations of monomers ( the value of @xmath27 ) and 12 experiments for each concentration ,",
    "table  i of eugne et al .",
    "@xcite shows that , in this setting , the estimation of @xmath28 is reasonably robust .",
    "this is unfortunately not the case for the numerical estimation of @xmath0 which is varying from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "an additional difficulty with this simple model comes from the small values of @xmath0 obtained . indeed , for the experiments , the value of the volume @xmath2 is in the order of @xmath31 , some of the estimated values of @xmath0 in @xmath32 are therefore , numerically , of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "the asymptotic results are obtained when @xmath2 gets large and @xmath0 _",
    "fixed_. for this reason , one may suspect a problem of convergence speed in relation   when these parameters are used .",
    "it turns out that our simulations confirm that the asymptotic regime   does not seem to represent accurately the system when @xmath0 is too small .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to refine this basic model in two different ways .    1 .",
    "the model can be improved by introducing a key feature of the polymerisation process : the misfolding of monomers .",
    "experiments show that monomers can be polymerised only if their @xmath34-d structure has been modified by some events .",
    "such monomers are called misfolded monomers , see dobson  @xcite , knowles et al .",
    "it turns out that , at a given time , only a small fraction of monomers are misfolded which may also explain that the polymerisation process starts very slowly . in biological cells ,",
    "this phenomenon of misfolding is reversible , dedicated proteins may `` correct '' the misfolded monomers .",
    "a misfolded monomer can be turned into a `` regular '' monomer and vice - versa .",
    "see bozaykut et al .",
    "@xcite and lanneau et al .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "section  [ alpsec ] is devoted to the mathematical analysis of these models .",
    "another approach is to keep the basic model but with the parameter @xmath0 being of the order of @xmath35 for some positive @xmath3 to take into account that , in practice , the values of this parameter can be very small .",
    "note that this is only a numerical observation , the value of @xmath0 has no reason to depend on the volume .",
    "this model is analyzed in section  [ alpsec ] .",
    "the rest of the section is devoted to a brief sketch of the mathematical aspects of these two classes of models .",
    "as it will be seen , the models are more challenging from a mathematical point of view , the model with misfolded monomers in particular .",
    "the chemical reactions associated with this simple model are as follows : @xmath36 at time @xmath8 , @xmath37 denotes the number of regular monomers , @xmath38 the number of misfolded monomers . as before the last coordinate @xmath39 is the polymerized mass . as a markov process , @xmath40 has the following transitions , for an element @xmath41 , @xmath42 it is important to note that the transition between state `` 0 '' , regular monomer , and state `` 1 '' , misfolded monomer , is spontaneous .",
    "consequently , as it can be seen , the corresponding transition rates _ do not _ depend on the volume @xmath2 but simply on the numbers of components and not on their concentrations .",
    "an important consequence of this observation is that the system exhibits a two time scales behavior that we will investigate .",
    "the first two coordinates can be seen as an ehrenfest process with two urns @xmath44 and @xmath45 where each particle in urn @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) goes to urn @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath44 ) at rate @xmath46 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 ) .",
    "see bingham  @xcite and karlin and mcgregor  @xcite for example .",
    "particles in urn @xmath45 can also go to the urn @xmath18 corresponding to the polymerized mass but this phenomenon occurs at a much slower rate so that , locally , it does not change the orders of magnitude in @xmath2 of @xmath48 .    when @xmath49 , there is a total of @xmath50 particles in the urns @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "the components @xmath51 are both of the order of @xmath2 and are moving on a fast time scale , proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the transition rates of the process @xmath43 are slower , bounded with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "because of the fast transition rates of the first two coordinates , the ehrenfest urn process should reach quickly an equilibrium for which @xmath52 has a binomial distribution with parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 , in particular @xmath56 this suggests that ,    1 .   to see an evolution of @xmath48 of the order of @xmath2 , one has to be on the linear time scale @xmath57 : transition rates of the process @xmath48 are @xmath58 ) , 2 .",
    "if @xmath59 , in view of transition rates of @xmath43 of relation  , then @xmath25 should satisfy the following ordinary differential equation @xmath60    we recognize the limit equation   of the simple model , where @xmath0 , @xmath28 are respectively replaced by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this result is also true when considering the second order fluctuations of the number of polymers , see theorem  [ cltmf ] .",
    "the proof of the convergence of the process of the concentration of polymerized monomers to the solution of the ode   use standard arguments of convergence of a sequence of stochastic processes , see the supplementary material of eugne et al .",
    "the proof of the corresponding result with misfolding phenomena for the ode   is , as we shall see , more delicate to handle .      to summarize these observations , the coordinates @xmath51 form a `` fast '' process and",
    "@xmath43 is a `` slow '' process when the scaling parameter @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "this suggests a stochastic averaging principle ( sap ) in a fully coupled context .    1 .",
    "the stochastic evolution of @xmath63 is driven by the invariant distribution of an `` instantaneous '' associated ehrenfest process .",
    "the parameters of the ehrenfest process depend on the macroscopic variable @xmath63 .",
    "see papanicolaou et al .",
    "@xcite and chapter  8 of freidlin and wentzell  @xcite for example , see also kurtz  @xcite .    a stochastic averaging principle is indeed proved as well as a corresponding central limit theorem ( clt ) . in our cases",
    "there are some differences with the `` classical '' framework of stochastic averaging principles .",
    "the state space of the fast process depends on the scaling parameter @xmath2 , and is not in particular a `` fixed '' process ( with varying parameters ) as it is usually the case .",
    "see hunt and kurtz  @xcite or sun et al .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "a law of large numbers with respect to @xmath2 for the invariant distribution of the fast process is driving the evolution of the slow process .",
    "the approach used in the paper relies on the use of occupation measures on a continuous state space instead of a discrete space , this leads to some technical complications as it will be seen .",
    "concerning central limit theorems in a sap context , there are few references available for jump processes .",
    "the methods presented in kang et al .",
    "@xcite or in sun et al .",

    "<S> one of the simplest models considers two populations of chemical components : monomers and polymerised monomers . </S>",
    "<S> initially there are only monomers . </S>",
    "<S> there are two reactions for the polymerization of a monomer : either two monomers collide to combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the encounter of a polymerised monomer . </S>",

    "<S> this paper investigates extensions of this model to take into account other mechanisms of the polymerization process that may have impact an impact on fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the first variant consists in introducing a preliminary conformation step to take into account the biological fact that , before being polymerised , a monomer has two states , regular or misfolded . </S>",
    "<S> only misfolded monomers can be polymerised so that the fluctuations of the number of misfolded monomers can be also a source of variability of the number of polymerised monomers . </S>",
    "<S> the second variant , based on numerical considerations , represents the reaction rate @xmath0 of spontaneous formation of a polymer as of the order of @xmath1 , for some large scaling variable @xmath2 representing the reaction volume and @xmath3 some positive constant . </S>",
