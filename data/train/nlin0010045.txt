    "the statistical distribution of quantum energy levels is a much studied topic .",
    "it has been conjectured that generic , classically integrable systems give rise to uncorrelated quantum spectra @xcite , while the energy levels of generic classically chaotic systems have the same statistical properties as the eigenvalues of random matrices @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by semiclassical theory @xcite , and in a large number of numerical studies , but classes of systems have also been found for which it is not true ; these include geodesic motion on surfaces of constant negative curvature @xcite , and the cat maps @xcite .    quantum graphs @xcite are mathematical models introduced in order to explore the connection between the periodic orbits of a system and the statistical properties of its energy levels .",
    "the trace formula , in which the level density is connected to a sum over periodic orbits , is exact for graphs , rather than a semiclassical approximation , and the orbits can be classified straightforwardly . however , despite the fact that numerical computations have revealed good conformance of the spectral statistics of many quantum graphs to the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , few conclusive analytical results have been obtained so far .",
    "this is due to the fact that although some individual finite graphs can be shown to reproduce certain features of rmt behaviour @xcite , the full rmt results can only be recovered in a limit in which one is forced to consider larger and larger graphs , and this necessitates finding general , combinatorial asymptotic techniques for dealing with the ( non - trivial ) length degeneracies of the periodic orbits .",
    "one family of graphs in which this goal has been achieved are the star graphs @xcite ( defined below and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] ) , but in this case the resulting spectral statistics are neither rmt nor poissonian ( i.e.  those of random numbers ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that it is not the first time that such statistics have arisen in the connection with the study of quantum chaos .",
    "our purpose here is to demonstrate that the star graphs have exactly the same two point spectral correlations as a large class of quantum systems , which we will refer to as _",
    "eba billiards_.    the original eba billiard , a rectangular quantum billiard perturbed by a point singularity ( also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] ) , was introduced in @xcite as an example of a system whose classical counterpart is integrable ( the singularity affects only a set of measure zero of the orbits ) but which nonetheless exhibits properties of quantum chaos .",
    "this construction was later generalized to all integrable systems @xcite perturbed in the same way .",
    "we will refer to any system in this class as a eba billiard .",
    "the energy levels of a eba billiard can be found by solving an explicit equation which depends on the levels of the original unperturbed system and on the boundary conditions imposed at the singularity .",
    "this equation takes the general form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the meromorphic function @xmath2 the sum being suitably regularized to ensure convergence . here",
    "@xmath3 are the eigenvalues of the unperturbed system , @xmath4 is the value of the @xmath5th unperturbed eigenfunction at the position @xmath6 of the singularity , and the coupling constant @xmath7 parametrizes the boundary conditions @xcite . assuming that @xmath3 are given by a poisson process , one can then calculate the associated spectral statistics , such as the joint level distribution , asymptotics of the level spacing distribution @xcite , and the two - point spectral correlation function @xcite .",
    "the results show the presence of spectral correlations but are substantially different from the rmt forms .    here",
    "we apply the methods developed for eba billiards in @xcite to calculate the two - point spectral correlation function for star graphs , starting from an expression which is analogous to ( [ eq : se_seba ] ) .",
    "the formula obtained will be shown to be a resummation of the expansion computed from the periodic orbit sum in @xcite .",
    "our main result will be that this correlation function is the same as that already found for eba billiards in the case when @xmath8 ( e.g.  when the billiard is rectangular with periodic boundary conditions ) and @xmath9 .",

    "the range of convergence can be extended using pad approximation ( again , see fig .",

    "finally , applying condition  ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) and dividing by @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 similar expressions can easily be found when different boundary conditions are applied at the central vertex .",
