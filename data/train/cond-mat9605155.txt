    "there is a general agreement that the three - band hubbard model is an appropriate basis for consideration of the spin and charge excitations in the cuo@xmath3 planes of high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting problems for these systems is the hole energy spectrum .",
    "one - hole energy calculation in the framework of the above mentioned model has been done by barabanov , kuzian , maksimov , and uimin @xcite who used the variational approach .",
    "this method seems to be too complicated since the characteristic energy scale of the three - band model is a few electron - volts while that of the hole energy spectrum is several tenths of an electron - volt .",
    "therefore , it is natural to obtain first the low - energy limit of the three - band model @xcite and then to investigate the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the framework of this effective model @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted by now that the simple model which contains in itself the interacting spin and charge degrees of freedom is the so called @xmath0-@xmath2 model @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the nearest neighbor sites , @xmath12 is the local spin operator , @xmath13 is the constrained fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "the explicit form of this constraint depends on the type of doping .    the considerable attention that this model has received originates partly from the fact that it can be derived from the above mentioned three - band or more general @xmath14 models which take into account the detailed electronic structure of the copper oxides .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite that this derivation can be done quantitatively for the real cuo@xmath3 planes by the use of an additional calculation of some experimentally observable values .",
    "the behavior of a single quasiparticle in the @xmath0-@xmath2 model has been studied intensively using both analytical and numerical techniques @xcite .",
    "these investigations have clearly shown that the naive tight - binding picture is completely inadequate for the carrier motion on the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "namely , for the realistic @xmath15 the bandwidth is of the order of @xmath16 , not @xmath17 .",
    "this strong ( of the order of 10 times ) bandwidth suppression results from the distortion of the spin background by the carrier hopping from one sublattice to the other . in this situation ,",
    "when the characteristic energy scale becomes @xmath2 , even small ( compared to @xmath0 ) single - sublattice hopping @xmath18 can be the key parameter for the subtle details of the energy spectrum and other features of the doped systems .",
    "this is clear since the single - sublattice motion does not disturb the spin background .",
    "hence , a careful analysis of the low - energy single band limit of the realistic @xmath14 models should be done keeping all essential terms over the @xmath19 ( not @xmath20 ) parameter .",
    "the simplest form of the additional @xmath18-terms can be written as @xmath21 emphasizing that the nonzero o - o hopping provides large enough transfer amplitude to the next - nearest ( @xmath22 ) neighbor @xcite .",
    "this term ( [ 1a ] ) alone has been found to be responsible for the cuo@xmath3 plane electron - hole asymmetry and to be useful for the interpretation of the recent angle - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to exhibit the _ general _ form of the additional @xmath18-terms which one can get from the three - band hubbard or the other first - principle models , to determine numerical ranges of all essential parameters for the real cuo@xmath3 planes , and to calculate a single - particle dispersion using the spin - polaron ideas .",
    "namely , we will demonstrate that two types of the additional @xmath18-terms naturally originate in the single - band model : ( i ) the terms arising from the o - o hopping , and ( ii ) the second - order high - energy channels terms @xcite .",
    "the importance of both of them will be clearly shown .",
    "the first ones are the key parameters for the band minima shifts , while the second ones lead to the growing of the bandwidth .",
    "a quite similar model was investigated in the mean - field approximation for a special range of parameters in the work by onufrieva _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "this approximation neglects some essential features of the hole ( electron)-spin interaction and thus has only a qualitative character .",
    "single - hole energy calculation in the limiting case of the three - band model using the self - consistent born approximation has been done in the work by starykh _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in spite of neglecting some features of the problem , the results of this approach are in a qualitative agreement with the present paper .",
    "the quantitative reduction of the three - band model developed in ref.@xcite for the real cuo@xmath3 system provides the method of the derivation of a set of the _ realistic",
    "_ ranges for all additional @xmath18-terms .",
    "we will show that the band minima shifts as well as the bandwidths are not small for these ranges of parameters .",
    "also , the density of states ( dos ) characteristic features will be discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give the general form of the corrections to the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , discuss them , and show the possible parameters ranges . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss our results for the spin - polaron dispersions and for the dos features . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we draw conclusions .",
    "the most accurate form of the effective @xmath18-terms that follows from the three - band hubbard model is @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the second ( third ) next - nearest neighbor sites , @xmath25 denotes the three nearest neighbor sites ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the number of fermions operator , @xmath29 is the local spin operator , @xmath30 is the pauli matrix , @xmath31 .",
    "the differences in the explicit form of the @xmath13 operators for the hole- and electron - doped systems as well as the signs of @xmath32 will be discussed later .",
    "now we will consider the origin of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms .",
    "let us begin from the last ones .",
    "the second - order perturbation treatment of the usual hubbard model near half filling provides the effective superexchange interaction ( eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) and the so called ` three - site spin - dependent hopping ' @xcite .",
    "their importance for both the spectrum of the charge excitation and the hole - hole interaction was noted @xcite .",
    "these terms in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , manifestly , have the rotationaly invariant form . in the case of the usual hubbard model mapping to the @xmath0-@xmath18-@xmath2 model ,",
    "the expressions for the @xmath34 terms have the simplest form : @xmath35 it should be noted that this expression ( [ 3a ] ) is valid for both types of doping , and that the signs of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the same for the electron and hole due to the second - order nature of these terms .",
    "what would one expect from the three- or more - band hubbard model mapping ?    much more high - energy channels ( triplet , etc .",
    ") are opened for the virtual second - order transitions in comparison with the usual hubbard singlet only case @xcite .",
    "this leads to two effects : ( i ) @xmath38 , and ( ii ) @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the electron and hole hopping integrals , respectively . the exact expressions for @xmath42 and @xmath43 were derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . in spite of the contribution of the highest states ,",
    "the lowest singlet is the most important .",
    "the main features of these terms in the effective hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) remain unchanged , i.e. : ( i ) @xmath44 both for the electron and hole , and ( ii ) @xmath45 , so that they are not negligible .",
    "in addition , one can point out that at the mean - field level , @xmath46 and @xmath47 operators should be replaced with their averages @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which effectively leads to : @xmath50 with @xmath51 ) , where the additional factor 2 for the diagonal hopping integral @xmath52 as compared to the ` oversite ' @xmath53 arises from the two possible ways for the virtual processes on the square lattice .",
    "thus , the second - order terms in the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) can be approximately considered as the renormalizations of the ` bare ' @xmath54 amplitudes ( [ 4 ] ) . as was noted ,",
    "these renormalizations do not change the signs under changing of the doping type .",
    "now , return to the first two terms of the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "they are the first - order terms arising in the first - principle models for the cuo@xmath3 plane from the nonzero o - o hopping .",
    "while including of the @xmath18-term is evident @xcite , including of the @xmath55-term requires an additional explanation .",
    "physically , only the @xmath18-term can arise for the next - nearest neighbor cuo@xmath56-cuo@xmath56 local states due to the @xmath57 matrix element @xcite .",
    "as was shown @xcite the correct state of the oxygen low - energy degrees of freedom are the ortogonalized wannier states . consequently ,",
    "some ` unphysical ' transition amplitudes to the more distant neighbors arise .",
    "these amplitudes fall rapidly with distance , and only the @xmath58-terms should be kept in the low - energy model @xcite .    as was recently proposed in many works , the absolute sign of the @xmath18-terms for",
    "the electron- and hole - doped cuo@xmath3 systems could be the source of the strong electron - hole asymmetry in the magnetic phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the electron - hole asymmetry arises naturally in the three - band model @xcite .",
    "not only the signs of the hopping integrals , but also the orders of the elementary processes , that lead to the effective hopping , differ for the electron and hole .",
    "consideration of a simple limiting case as well as discussion of the electron - hole asymmetry and the dependence of the effective hopping integrals on the initial parameters are presented in appendix a. numerical results for the ranges of the effective parameters , based on the exact formulae of ref.@xcite and the approach developed in ref.@xcite , are shown in table i.    further , we will consider these ( table i ) @xmath59 values and @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xcite as the _ realistic _ ones .",
    "before doing the energy spectrum calculation let us discuss the sense of the constrained fermi operators @xmath62 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . both the hole and electron single - band low - energy hamiltonians derived from the three - band hubbard model are naturally expressed in terms of the hubbard operators at the site @xmath63 @xmath64 here the states @xmath65 are either spin or singlet ( vacancy ) local states . since the undoped state of the cuo@xmath3 plane is set up by the localized holes in the cu @xmath66 and o @xmath67 orbitals , the additional low - energy hole forms a singlet with the local one , whereas the electron in this background is a vacancy .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to rewrite @xmath68-parts of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a local spin state , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are singlet and vacancy states , respectively , @xmath73 denotes all essential neighbor sites .",
    "note , that the signs of the next - nearest hopping parameters shown in table i are related to _ these _ particular ( eq . (",
    "[ 9 ] ) ) order of the hubbard operators .",
    "the signs of the nearest neighbor hopping are : @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the later is not essential , since for the antiferromagnetic background the shift of the quasimomentum space by the vector of the reciprocal lattice @xmath76 changes the @xmath77 but physically changes nothing @xcite .",
    "we wish to stress that when the kinetic - energy part is of the single - band type ( as in eq.([9 ] ) ) , mapping of the hubbard operators onto the constrained fermi operator basis is twofold .",
    "if one prefers to retain the singlet ideology for the hole - doped system , the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ 9 ] ) can be rewritten identically as @xcite : @xmath78 and the background is created by the @xmath79-hole at every site .",
    "@xmath80 is the projection operator which project out the vacancy states ( ` double electron occupancy ' ) .",
    "this representation for the electron over the hole background is : @xmath81 where the operators @xmath82 project out the double hole occupancy .",
    "an alternative way is to consider the physical hole as a ` hole ' ( vacancy ) in the upper hubbard band @xcite , and the physical electron as the ` particle ' ( singlet ) in the lower one .",
    "this freedom in choosing is not connected with the initial orbital structure of the cuo@xmath3 plane , but follows from the algebra of the hubbard operators in eq.([9 ] ) .",
    "hence , eq.([11 ] ) for an extra electron on the electron background can be written as : @xmath83 at the first glance , it would seem that the choice of the ` particle ' ( eq.([12 ] ) ) or ` vacancy ' ( eq.([11 ] ) ) language leads to the change of the sign of the quasiparticle energy .",
    "this is not true , since the ` vacancy ' energy has the sign of @xmath84 reversed compared to the ` particle ' energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) lead to the _ same _ energy .",
    "thus , the explicit form of the constrained operators in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) is : @xmath85 for the physical hole ( electron ) system .",
    "hereafter , we will work with the hamiltonian eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , constraint from eqs . ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) , and parameters from table i.    properties of the single - particle in an antiferromagnetic background were studied in detail by many authors @xcite using different approaches .",
    "their results coincide at the point that the carriers are strongly dressed by the spin waves , i.e. quasiparticles are the magnetic polarons of a small radius with a strongly anisotropic dispersion law and small enough quasiparticle residue .",
    "we base our calculations on the results of ref .",
    ". the suggested trial function of an extra particle has the simple form @xcite : @xmath86 valid also for @xmath87 after changing @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 means the site @xmath91 of the spin - up ( -down ) sublattice , @xmath92 is the unit vector to the nearest neighbor site .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are given in appendix b. from the string picture point of view this simplest ansatz ( [ 13 ] ) consists of the ` bare ' particle and four shortest ` strings ' of the lattice constant length .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the one - hole dispersion as well as two - hole contact and long - range interactions , and even many - hole properties of the @xmath0-@xmath2 model are quantitatively well described using the above ansatz .",
    "consideration of the generalized @xmath18-terms ( eq.([2 ] ) ) does not require any changes in the trial function ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "roughly , this is due to the following reasons : ( i ) the @xmath18-terms lead to the motion of the particle over _ one _ sublattice without distortion of the spin background , that enables ` bare ' particle to propagate freely ; ( ii ) the motion of the ` dressed ' particle ( with a string ) mainly leads to longer strings , whose contribution to the energy is of the order of @xmath95 and parametrically small at @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the expansion of the ansatz makes a small decrease in the energy , since the part of the ansatz ( [ 13 ] ) , which would be mainly affected by the @xmath18-hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) , is the ` bare ' one . the last statement will be demonstrated below .    as was noted ,",
    "the @xmath18-induced transitions occur in one sublattice , therefore a good preliminary consideration of the role of each term in hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) can be done for the ising background .",
    "it allows us to find easily the leading contribution to the band minima shifts , bandwidths , and effective masses .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath97 operators in ( [ 2 ] ) should be replaced with @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the eigenenergy of the magnetic polaron ( [ 13 ] ) is @xmath100 where we omitted all high - order ( @xmath101 ) terms .",
    "e@xmath102 is the depth of the band , @xmath103 are the inverse masses in the directions ortogonal and parallel to the magnetic brillouin zone boundary , respectively . since for the ising case a particle of the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 model is dispersionless @xcite , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are constants and at the realistic @xmath106   @xmath107 .",
    "expression ( [ 14 ] ) for the energy coincides almost exactly with that obtained for the free spinless fermions @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the presence of the weight of the ` bare ' particle @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) . in the realistic region of @xmath109",
    "etc @xmath110 is very close to its @xmath0-@xmath111 model value @xmath112 .",
    "two notes should be done .",
    "firstly , the @xmath113-term ( [ 14 ] ) represents the dispersion which is degenerate along the @xmath114 line , whereas the @xmath115-term lifts out this degeneracy , placing the minima at the @xmath116 ( if @xmath117 ) or @xmath118 ( if @xmath119 ) points .",
    "the difference @xmath120 is proportional _ only _ to the ` first - order ' terms @xmath54 ( [ 14 ] ) and does not depend on the second - order @xmath36 , @xmath37 terms .",
    "secondly , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) that in the case @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath113 and bandwidth @xmath124 or @xmath125 are mostly determined by a few @xmath126 .",
    "the above qualitative calculation for the simple ising background results in conclusions , which remain valid for the nel case .",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath127 and @xmath128 points , which is the crucial value for the various calculations , has different signs for the hole- and electron - doped systems and is _ not small _ for both cases .",
    "it means that if the single - particle picture is valid for the finite doping regime , the quasiparticle fermi - surface will be located ( up to the high enough doping level ) near the points @xmath4 and @xmath129 for the hole- and electron - doped systems , respectively .",
    "also , it can be shown from eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) that , at least for the upper limit of the @xmath130 hopping parameters ( table i ) , the bandwidths are large enough .",
    "thus , one would expect decrease of the dos compared to the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 model one .",
    "finally , the role of the ` bare ' particle for the considered simple case is crucial , since the ` dressed ' part can not propagate freely in the absence of the spin fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the weight of the bare part in the trial wave function is the subject of the prime interest .",
    "as was noted @xmath131 , that is larger than in other works @xcite where @xmath132 . for @xmath133 the agreement is better : @xmath134 .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the transfer of the weight from the rest of the _ exact _ particle wave function ( with the infinite number of strings ) to the weight of the ` bare ' particle in the approximate ansatz ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "thus , our main approximation lies not in the ` shortness ' of the ansatz , but in the overestimation of the bare particle weight .",
    "this problem can be overcome by the simple renormalization of @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "let us discuss now what changes of the above results can be expected for the nel background .",
    "the main changes arise from the fact that due to the spin fluctuations the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 model particle is given the possibility to propagate .",
    "evidently , this will provide additions to @xmath103 and the bandwidth @xmath137 . also , the ` dressed ' part will lead to some coherent transitions . due to the more complex structure of the matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) for the nel background ,",
    "the simple tight - binding relations between @xmath138 and @xmath137 no longer hold .",
    "the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 dispersion law @xcite is : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 . due to the @xmath142-dependence of the trial wave function components @xmath143 and the nonzero matrix elements for the string components ,",
    "the first order contribution to the energy from the @xmath18-hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) contains extra terms with the highest powers of @xmath144 : @xmath145 where the @xmath146 and @xmath147 coefficients weakly depend on @xmath142 through the @xmath148 and @xmath149 quantities ( see appendix b ) . as was discussed earlier , the highest - order corrections to the energy from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) are of the order of @xmath95 , and for the realistic @xmath150 and @xmath18 from table i can be neglected ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "since @xmath148 is almost constant , the renormalization to the ` normal ' @xmath152 can be accomplished by the simple replacing @xmath153 .",
    "figures [ fig1]-[fig4 ] present our results for the hole and electron dispersions .",
    "contour plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the characteristic feature of the hole dispersion in the whole brillouin zone .",

    "this qualitative picture clearly demonstrates that due to the @xmath18-terms the system becomes ` less strongly correlated ' because of the ` liberating ' of the bare carrier .",

    "the dashed lines demonstrate the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 model dispersions .",
    "our calculations of the @xmath18-part ( [ 18 ] ) in the dispersion demonstrate that the ` bare ' particle contribution for the nel case is very close to the results for the ising background and that the ` dressed ' particle contribution plays a minor role ( @xmath160 ) compared to the ` bare ' one . using the data from table i",
    ", the variations of the inverse mass values and the bandwidths for the hole and electron are found as follows : @xmath161 in spite of some changes in the inverse mass values ( [ 19 ] ) , the features discussed earlier for the ising case are still valid .",
    "thus , the shifts of the band minima are rather large , the bandwidths are substantially wider as compared to those in the @xmath0-@xmath2 model , and the role of the bare particle weight remains the most important .",
    "one of the unsolved problem of the @xmath0-@xmath2 type models is : whether the free - particle approximation work for the doped systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , the extension of the single - particle calculation onto the case of finite doping indeed requires justifications . some of them can be found in refs .",
    "we simply accept the free particle picture and have calculated the chemical potential as the function of concentration for the dispersion law ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 18 ] ) . from figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig4 ] it is clear that the ground state is @xmath162 for the hole , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 for the electron",
    ". both minima are not shallow : @xmath163 . at the same time , the bandwidths are larger than @xmath0-@xmath2 ones ( @xmath164 ) , and the accumulation of the dos at low energy is smaller than for the @xmath0-@xmath2 model case .",
    "this point may be of interest in view of intensive discussion of the possible van hove singularity at the optimal doping @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned two different tendencies to increase the minima shifts and to decrease the dos require a quantitative consideration .",

    "to summarize , in this paper we have studied the microscopically derived extended type of the @xmath0-@xmath18-@xmath2 model .",
    "previous investigations of the three - band model allowed us to establish the necessary next - neighbor terms for the low - energy single - band model . in this work",

    "however , the use of the direct - product basis is incorrect when more than one hubbard @xmath178 operators are of the fermi type .",
    "this is evident from their anticommutativity . in the other words ,",
    "the wave function of the half - filled background ( one fermion per site ) can not be uniquely determined in this basis .",
    "formally , the two - site wave function @xmath182 is determined correctly since the singlet @xmath181 is the boson .",
    "nevertheless , for the matrix elements of the hopping hamiltonian , which consists of the creation and annihilation operators of an additional fermion , one gets : @xmath183 |s   \\rangle_i \\otimes |\\uparrow \\rangle_j \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\equiv & & t_{ij } \\langle   \\uparrow|_i\\otimes \\langle \\uparrow|_j \\cdot |\\uparrow \\rangle_i   \\otimes |\\uparrow \\rangle_j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the matrix element reduces to the projection of the one half - filled state to the other and hence has an uncertain sign .",
    "therefore , to avoid this uncertainty one has to use a more conventional basis , namely : @xmath184 , where @xmath185 means the groundstate ( one fermion per site ) , and @xmath186 is the creation operator of the additional fermion .",
    "this careful approach leads to the signs of the hopping amplitudes as presented in eq.([a1 ] ) and in table i. note that this difference of the bases is absent for the single fermion in the lattice or for particles obeying bose statistics .",
    "approximate expressions ( [ a1 ] ) for @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath55 are good enough for large and even moderate @xmath173 .",
    "thus , our calculations of the @xmath0 , @xmath18 , @xmath55 realistic values for the cuo@xmath3 plane , show that @xmath187 at least for small values of @xmath188 ( cu - o coulomb repulsion ) .",
    "this is due to the partial compensation of the cu - o and o - o contribution to the @xmath18-term , that can be seen in eq.([a1 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath57 contribution to the hopping of the vacancy arises only in the third order of @xmath175 ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the above mentioned compensation of the o - o and cu - o amplitudes for the electron @xmath190-term is even more pronounced than for the hole .",
    "the exact formulae @xcite provide very small @xmath190 for @xmath191 .    to be more specific , in our calculations",
    "we have followed the idea of the narrowing of the uncertainty region for the low - energy model parameters using some experimentally observed values .",
    "this approach was developed in ref.@xcite and enabled us to calculate @xmath192 and @xmath193 for the real cuo@xmath3 planes .",
    "our results for the @xmath194 hopping integrals obtained in the same way for the two types of doping are shown in table i.    we wish to stress the strong @xmath188-dependence of @xmath18 both for the hole and electron carriers . this @xmath195 dependence can be easily understood .",
    "the rising of @xmath188 requires the lowering of the @xmath173 for the fixed values of the observable quantities .",
    "thus , the occupation number of oxygen sites also rises , which immediately leads to the growing of the @xmath57 contribution .",
    "note , that due to the smaller role of the oxygen degrees of freedom for the electron , its hopping integrals are less varying than those for hole .",
    "this is in agreement with the cluster calculations by eskes and sawatzky @xcite . in our three - band model calculations we used the experimental values of @xmath196 and @xmath197 ev ( lanthanum and yttrium systems ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the components @xmath93 , @xmath198 @xcite are : @xmath199^{1/2 } ,     \\\\     \\mu_{{\\bf k},{\\delta } } & = &      \\mu^1_{\\bf k } +   \\mu^2_{\\bf k } \\gamma_{\\bf k } e^{i{\\bf k}{\\delta } }   \\nonumber\\\\    & = & { t\\over { [ y s_{\\bf k } ( \\delta_0 + 2s_{\\bf k } ) ] ^{1/2 } } }     [ ( 1+v ) - ( u+v)\\gamma_{\\bf k } e^{i{\\bf k}{\\delta } } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where parameters @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 are expressed in terms of ground state correlators @xcite and for the nel state are : @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "@xmath209 is the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 model dispersion ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath210 at @xmath211 , @xmath93 and @xmath212 , @xmath213 are weakly varying functions of @xmath142 .",
    "explicit expressions for the @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath147 coefficients ( eq.([18 ] ) ) are : @xmath217 where @xmath218 numbers in eq .",
