    "one of the more striking results for a non - relativistic one - component coulomb plasma with a ( uniform ) neutralizing background charge density @xmath3 in unbounded space , as modeled by the vlasov - poisson system @xmath4 is the phenomenon of _",
    "landau damping_. as first noted by landau in 1946 @xcite , solutions to the linearization of vp@xmath5 about a uniform , maxwellian equilibrium can exhibit exponential decay of fourier modes associated to non - zero wavevectors in their spatial distributions , @xmath6 ( the electric field will also decay exponentially fast in such situations ) .",
    "as such , the linearized system seems to exhibit a _ time - irreversible _ behavior ( exponential decay to a constant background ) .",
    "what makes this result so surprising at first glance is that vp@xmath5 itself is _ time - reversible _ ( and so also is its linearization ) .",
    "by contrast , traditional approach - to - equilibrium results ( e.g. , plasmas described by the boltzmann equation tend to the uniform maxwellian background ) all involve irreversible equations describing dissipative systems where some lyapunov functional is decreasing as @xmath7 increases ( such as the negative entropy functional for the boltzmann equation ) . due to the form of the vlasov equation",
    "however , any reasonable lyapunov functional will be preserved under the evolution !",
    "many different physical mechanisms have been put forward to explain this apparent paradox , but from a purely mathematical perspective , the decrease in amplitude of @xmath6 is paid for at the expense of increasing derivative norms for @xmath8 .",
    "the increasing filamentation in phase space ( accompanied by increasingly higher frequency oscillations ) is such that it averages out in the marginal distribution @xmath6 .",
    "hence , from a mathematical point - of - view , landau damping is a kind of weak convergence result .",
    "for a nice introduction to these ideas , see @xcite .",
    "once we move from a mode - by - mode analysis to a full treatment of the linearized system , things become much trickier . since the zero fourier mode is always preserved in time ( as this represents the total charge ) , it is reasonable to expect that only modes associated to wavevectors well separated from zero can exhibit _ uniform _ exponential decay in time . on the 3-dimensional torus of size",
    "@xmath9 , this is a given since the smallest non - zero wavevector has magnitude @xmath10 .",
    "for plasmas distributed on the entirety of @xmath0 , we can only hope that modes above a certain threshold will decay uniformly exponentially fast .",
    "indeed , glassey and schaeffer @xcite have shown that for vp@xmath5 in one spatial dimension linearized about a uniform kinetic equilibrium , @xmath11 , the best overall decay rate ( as measured by @xmath12-norm ) one can hope for is @xmath13 . for the maxwellian equilibrium ,",
    "the decay rate is only like @xmath14 ( in three spatial dimensions , they also show the decay for the maxwellian is like @xmath15 ) , and for @xmath16 radially decreasing and compactly supported , there can be no decay at all . in general , the faster @xmath17 limits to zero as @xmath18 , the slower @xmath6 tends to zero in @xmath12-norm .",
    "hence , confinement of the plasma ( as in the torus ) seems essential for true exponential decay .    for many years",
    ", this damping phenomenon was known rigorously only for the linearized system .",
    "recently , mouhot and villani @xcite have succeeded in showing that sufficiently regular solutions to both the fully non - linear vp@xmath19 and vp@xmath20 systems on the torus do indeed exhibit the damping phenomenon exponentially in time ; here , vp@xmath21 is the gravitational analog of the coulombic vp@xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , they show that for an analytic kinetic equilibrium , @xmath22 , satisfying certain stability criteria ( along with constraints on the sizes of its derivatives and fourier transform ) there is an @xmath23 so that all initial data , @xmath24 , within @xmath25 of @xmath16 in an appropriate norm limit exponentially fast in @xmath7 to a spatially uniform state as @xmath26 .",
    "when we inquire about landau damping for relativistic plasmas , we find much less information in the literature . in 1994",
    ", schlickeiser @xcite examined the phenomenon for mono - charged , relativistic plasmas close to the spatially uniform jttner distribution ( which is the relativistic version of the maxwellian profile ) . working with an expression for the plasma conductivity tensor",
    "linearized about this relativistic equilibrium ( derived earlier by trubnikov ) , he found that there is a temperature - dependent critical magnitude , @xmath27 , so that `` superluminal oscillations undergo no landau damping , '' ( see the abstract of @xcite ) corresponding to wavevectors of magnitude below the critical value ( it is our reading of the paper @xcite that `` landau damping '' is meant in the strict sense of exponential decay ) .",
    "this is in sharp contradistinction to the situation for non - relativistic plasmas linearized about the maxwellian where no such critical @xmath27 is to be found . as such",
    ", mono - charged relativistic plasmas may not exhibit exponential decay to the uniform equilibrium on the torus even for very nice initial data ( depending , of course , on the ambient temperature and size of the torus ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to begin a rigorous examination of the behavior of relativistic plasmas in the spirit of mouhot and villani . as a first step , we study the behavior of fourier modes for the _ relativistic vlasov - poisson system _ ( rvp which we define below ) linearized about a sufficiently nice , spatially uniform kinetic equilibrium . since at this level we work only on a mode - by - mode basis , many of our computations hold equally well in the full space as on the torus . as such , we provide results in both cases .    incidentally",
    ", `` relativistic vlasov - poisson '' may sound like a strange mix of relativistic and non - relativistic physics , but in fact it is a special case of the _ relativistic vlasov - maxwell system _ ( rvm ) : @xmath28 which describes the evolution of a mono - charged , dilute ( i.e. collisionless ) plasma with phase - space distribution function @xmath29 ( the magnitude of charge for the particles comprising the plasma is given by @xmath30 ) ; these equations are understood to be in the rest frame of the neutralizing background ( otherwise , one would need to add a corresponding background current @xmath31 ) .",
    "the relativistic velocity in terms of the momentum is given by @xmath32 in units where the speed of light and the mass of the particles in question are both equal to 1 .",
    "for an excellent introduction to this system see @xcite .",
    "should we make the ansatz that @xmath33 is identically zero for all times , we arrive at the _",
    "relativistic vlasov - poisson system _ ( rvp ) : @xmath34 in the case that the initial data , @xmath16 , for rvm is spherically symmetric ( and there is no stray electromagnetic radiation from sources at infinity ) , we obtain @xmath35 for all times without further ado . hence , we expect rvp to be significant for spherical , single - specie plasmas .",
    "if we allow the parameter @xmath36 appearing in rvp to become negative , we obtain a model which formally describes a gas of relativistic particles interacting through newtonian gravitation .",
    "such a model might well be assumed to be valid for a sufficiently `` hot '' gas ( so that the use of the relativistic velocity is justified ) but rarefied enough that gravity is adequately modeled by the poisson equation .",
    "currently , the only work along these lines known to the author is @xcite wherein rendall proves that sufficiently regular , asymptotically flat initial data for the fully covariant vlasov - einstein system launches solutions which are well approximated by the _ non - relativistic _ vlasov - poisson system .",
    "however in @xcite , kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh proposed a novel scheme whereby this attractive version of rvp might result from a two - specie version of rvm wherein the oppositely charged species are distributed spherically .",
    "the author has investigated this proposal , and the results will be reported elsewhere .    since in the following",
    "we will examine both types of systems , we refer to rvp with the repulsive interaction as rvp@xmath5 ( or the _ plasma - physics case _ ) and rvp with the attractive potential as rvp@xmath21 ( or the _ astrophysical case _ ) .",
    "we will show in this paper that the behavior of all fourier modes of linearized rvp@xmath37 is decidedly different from that of the non - relativistic vp@xmath37  not only the behavior of the superluminal modes as already noted by schlickeiser . before we begin the discussion of linearized rvp@xmath37 , we close this introduction with a brief overview of rigorous results concerning the fully non - linear rvp systems",
    ".    one of the earliest papers to appear on rvp@xmath37 is @xcite wherein glassey and schaeffer show that global classical solutions will exist for initial data that are spherically symmetric , compactly supported in momentum space , and vanish on characteristics with vanishing angular momentum which are in addition compactly supported in @xmath38 and have @xmath39-norm below a critical constant @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 more recently , kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh @xcite have extended the theorem of glassey and schaeffer for rvp@xmath21 by proving global existence of classical solutions for initial data which satisfy the same basic requirements as above but are in @xmath43 and have @xmath44-norm below a critical constant @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and @xmath45 identically zero iff @xmath47 the authors explicitly computed @xmath48 but characterized the constant for other values of @xmath49 as a variational problem .",
    "the constants for the remaining cases were computed by the author @xcite in terms of the famous lane - emden functions .",
    "glassey and schaeffer also investigated what may happen when solutions to rvp@xmath21 are launched by initial data with @xmath50 .",
    "they proved that negative energy data lead to  blow - up \" ( i.e. formation of a singularity ) in finite time .",
    "this is in sharp contradistinction to the non - relativistic vlasov - poisson system with attractive coupling ( vp@xmath21 ) which does not exhibit finite time blow - up for classical data .",
    "indeed , the possibility of collapse for solutions to rvp@xmath21 is a primary motivation for studying the system - as the collapse is due solely to  relativistic effects . \" in @xcite , lemou , mhats , and raphal proved that systems launched by initial data with negative total energy approach a self - similar collapse profile . around the same time , kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh proved that any spherically symmetric classical solution of rvp@xmath21 launched by initial data satisfying @xmath51 ( along with other technical requirements ) and having _ zero total energy _ and total ( scalar ) virial less than or equal to @xmath52 will blow up in finite time ( theorem 6.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , they left open the question whether such initial data existed .",
    "explicit examples of such data were found by the author and reported in @xcite .",
    "there has also been much work concerning the nonlinear stability of stationary solutions of rvp@xmath21 and the dynamical details of the solutions which blow - up in finite time .",
    "hadi and rein @xcite showed the non - linear stability of a wide class of steady - state solutions of @xmath53 against certain allowable perturbations utilizing energy - casimir functionals . shortly thereafter ,",
    "lemou , mhats , and raphal @xcite investigated non - linear stability versus the formation of singularities in @xmath53 through concentration compactness techniques .    as for work on decay rates for the full rvp system in unbounded space ,",
    "horst @xcite showed in 1990 that continuously differentiable , spherically symmetric initial data which are compactly supported launch solutions whose spatial matter distributions decay almost like @xmath54 in @xmath39-norm ( there is a logarithmic factor in the decay rate ) . in 2009 ,",
    "glassey , pankavich , and schaeffer @xcite proved that non - trivial , continuously differentiable initial data for rvp@xmath20 in 1.5 dimensions with compact support exhibit no decay whatsoever in @xmath55-norm for @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the results of this paper ( though only at the level of the linearized equations ) seem to suggest that this absence of rapid decay in @xmath6 persists in three - dimensions ( though slower decay through dispersion is still to be expected ) .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ results ] provides a summary of our basic assumptions and results for the torus and the full space . following this , we collect all the relevant functional analytic details we shall need in section [ gev_sect ] .",
    "sections [ torus_sect ] and [ full_space_sect ] provide the proofs of all theorems for the case of the torus and the full space , respectively .",
    "finally , we collect in the appendix several important ( but lengthy ) calculations proving decay rates of certain functions appearing in sections [ torus_sect ] and [ full_space_sect ] .    * acknowledgements : * the author wishes to thank yves elskens , michael kiessling , and markus kunze for numerous enlightening conversations and many helpful comments .",
    "the author also wishes to thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out a serious issue with the handling of the astrophysical case in the original formulation .",
    "in this section , we will give the basic setup for rvp on both the torus and the full space , list the basic assumptions on the equilibrium and initial data , and state the major results of the paper . despite the fact that the conclusions are similar ( for a mode - by - mode study , at any rate ) ,",
    "we have divided the discussion of the two cases into separate subsections .",
    "the methods we use to attack the evolution of the fourier modes in either case follow largely the treatment in @xcite for the linearized ( non - relativistic ) vlasov - poisson system .",
    "the relativistic vlasov - poisson system on @xmath57 ( the three - dimensional torus of volume @xmath58 in the spatial variables ) is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 models a system with repulsive interaction ( the _ plasma - physics _ case ) while @xmath62 models a system with attractive interaction ( the _ astrophysical _ case ) .",
    "we will identify the torus as the cube @xmath63 ^ 3 $ ] in @xmath0 equipped with periodic boundary conditions .    defining @xmath64",
    ", we can write @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fundamental solution to laplace s equation @xmath67 on the torus .",
    "hence , we obtain the equivalent integro - partial - differential equation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 in the repulsive case and @xmath70 in the attractive case .",
    "we wish to study the behavior of solutions to rvp@xmath71 that are close ( in some suitable sense ) to a sufficiently nice steady - state solution @xmath72 ( with total mass @xmath73 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath74 with @xmath75 `` small '' compared to @xmath16 ( at the very least , we will need @xmath76 to remain non - negative ) .",
    "we note that we can always assume the initial condition , @xmath77 , is a _ neutral variation _ of @xmath16  by which we mean @xmath78 if @xmath77 does not satisfy this , letting @xmath79 , we can take @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( which will still be positive as long as @xmath77 is a small variation of @xmath16 ) . of course , this would necessitate replacing @xmath82 in the rvp system above by @xmath83 , but this merely amounts to a redefinition of the total mass of the system .",
    "since the equilibrium steady state solution makes no contribution to the force term , we have @xmath84 if @xmath75 is indeed a small perturbation of @xmath16 , we can hope that the quadratic term in this integro - pde makes little contribution to the dynamics . formally dropping this term , we arrive at the linearized relativistic vlasov - poisson equation : @xmath85 we note that in both the full non - linear equation and the linearized equation for @xmath75 , the neutral variation condition is propagated in time : @xmath86    we can give a formal solution to the linearized rvp system through duhamel s principle .",
    "defining @xmath87 we find that the solution to can be represented as @xmath88    we wish to study the behavior of the spatial fourier modes for this system .",
    "since we are on the torus , the wavevectors are discrete and can be indexed by @xmath89 .",
    "the appropriate transform is @xmath90 we note that we are only interested in modes with @xmath91 as the zero mode ( which is just the total mass of the system ) is certainly conserved in time and equal to zero by our assumption that @xmath77 is a neutral variation . taking the transform of both sides of we arrive at @xmath92 integrating in @xmath93 , we see that @xmath94 since @xmath95 we have the following equation for the fourier modes : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and where @xmath98 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath99 . note that ( just as in the non - relativistic case ) the mode associated to the wavevector @xmath99 evolves independently of any other mode via a volterra equation .",
    "first and foremost , we will easily deduce from the following :    [ no_exp_decay_torus ] for any kinetic equilibrium data , @xmath16 , only depending on @xmath100 and initial data , @xmath77 , symmetric enough that the rate of decay as @xmath7 tends to minus infinity matches the rate of decay as @xmath7 tends to infinity ( in particular , if @xmath101 ) , exponential decay of fourier modes is not possible for the linearized relativistic vlasov - poisson system on the torus .",
    "hence , if we narrowly interpret landau damping as exponential decay of modes , then we see that this phenomenon can not occur for rvp on the torus ( at least under the typical symmetry assumptions invoked in most all results known about rvp ) .",
    "moreover , we will see that this theorem is a direct consequence of the universal speed limit imposed by relativity ( @xmath102 in our units ) . as such ,",
    "this is likely to be true for any reasonable relativistic model of a plasma .    despite this fact",
    ", it will be possible for modes to decay sub - exponentially ( i.e. like @xmath103 for @xmath2 ) . to see this",
    ", we make the following assumptions on the equilibrium , @xmath16 , and initial datum , @xmath77 :    [ asp 1 ] let @xmath16 be schwartz class on @xmath0 and @xmath77 be schwartz class on @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , for a given , non - zero wavevector , @xmath99 , suppose there is an @xmath105 and a constant @xmath106 so that @xmath107 where @xmath98 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath99 . also , assume @xmath108 is such that @xmath101 and that @xmath109 . finally , assume @xmath11 is spherically symmetric and strictly decreasing in @xmath100 .    here , we have used the relativistic formula for momentum in terms of velocity @xmath110 which is just the inverse of .",
    "we should note that as @xmath16 is independent of @xmath111 , the constants appearing in could be chosen independent of @xmath99 . for our purposes ,",
    "the estimates in the direction of the wavevector @xmath99 will be all that is required ( even if @xmath16 admits a uniform estimate for these quantities ) .",
    "note that these assumptions are true for the most important case of the jttner distribution at temperature @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath115 is the modified bessel function of the second kind with index 2 .",
    "this describes the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of momenta in a spatially uniform , relativistic ideal gas ( analogous to the maxwellian distribution for non - relativistic gases ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath116 can be taken to be 3 for this distribution ( as can be shown via standard facts about gevrey class functions - c.f . @xcite and section [ gev_sect ] below ) .",
    "we note that our results can be easily extended to the case where the equilibrium is decreasing and compactly supported ( the critical constants below will need to change accordingly )",
    ".    given the assumptions above , we can show :    [ decay_rate_torus ] in the plasma - physics case ( @xmath69 ) , suppose @xmath117f_0(|p|)d|p| > 0 .",

    "we refer to modes whose wavevectors satisfy and as _ supercritical modes_. the modes associated to the remaining ( non - zero ) wavevectors will naturally be called subcritical .",
    "nb : since the terms `` supercritical '' and  subcritical \" occur in a variety of different contexts with various meanings , we emphasize that our use of the terms is rather literal here .",
    "supercritical modes are those with wavevectors of magnitude strictly larger than the critical value ( and so subcritical modes are those with wavevectors of magnitude less than or equal to the critical value ) .",
    "note that it is the supercritical modes which are damped out at a rather fast rate .",
    "the behavior of the subcritical modes is more delicate , but in general we suspect that they will be damped out much slower than the supercritical modes ( or perhaps not damped at all on the torus ) .",
    "while we do not provide anything more than heuristic reasoning that the subcritical modes are not rapidly damped , our expectations seem to be well - founded .",
    "for example , lerche @xcite shows that subcritical modes ( supra - luminous in his terminology ) for the electric field are damped out only like @xmath123 for a one - dimensional relativistic plasma excited by an initial impulse at the origin of infinitesimal duration .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", we plot the square root of the right - hand side of for the jttner distribution as a function of @xmath124 .     for the jttner distribution , title=\"fig : \" ] +    note that the maximum of this quantity occurs somewhere near @xmath125 with a size of roughly @xmath126 .",
    "since the zero mode is zero by our neutral variation assumption , the wavevector with the smallest possible non - zero magnitude for a given torus parameter , @xmath9 , is of size @xmath127 .",
    "hence , for tori of  modest \" size , there may be no subcritical modes at all .",
    "indeed , for @xmath128 there are no subcritical modes at any temperature for the jttner distribution . clearly , for a given temperature ,",
    "@xmath129 there is a critical torus dimension , @xmath130 so that @xmath131 implies that all modes in the repulsive case are supercritical .",
    "next , we plot the square root of the right - hand side of for the jttner distribution as a function of @xmath124 .     for the jttner distribution , title=\"fig : \" ] +    by way of comparison with the plasma - physics case , note that as the temperature of the gravitational plasma increases , the curve approaches zero .",
    "so , for very hot gravitational plasmas ( on the torus ) , it is possible that modes for every non - zero wavevector can be damped out . as the temperature approaches zero , however , the curve diverges to positive infinity ( numerical estimates show that it diverges like @xmath132 for @xmath133 ) .",
    "hence , colder gravitational plasmas can have relatively slow decay of modes associated to arbitrarily large wavevectors .",
    "we should note that we have made no attempt to be optimal in our choice of assumptions [ asp 1 ] .",
    "these are merely the most convenient conditions which will ensure the rate of decay we wish to show is possible for relativistic plasmas .",
    "also , our technique does not easily address how the critical constant @xmath120 depends on the wavevector @xmath99 .",
    "given that the wavevectors are discrete on the torus , we suspect that the constants @xmath134 and @xmath116 can be chosen uniformly for all @xmath99 larger than a given magnitude ( perhaps a magnitude slightly larger than the supercritical boundary ) .",
    "indeed , following the work of bedrossian , masmoudi , and mouhot @xcite for non - relativistic plasmas , recent work by the author @xcite has shown that there can be uniform decay in @xmath7 for plasmas on the torus satisfying certain regularity conditions .",
    "in particular , these conditions would require that there be no subcritical modes ( other than @xmath135 , naturally ) .",
    "of course , taking the torus parameter , @xmath9 , sufficiently small will guarantee that all non - zero wavevectors are larger than a given magnitude .",
    "once we extend our examination to the entirety of @xmath0 , we are immediately forced to make a rather serious choice as to how to proceed .",
    "as before , the vlasov equation for rvp is given by : @xmath136 where once again @xmath69 is the repulsive ( plasma - physics ) case while @xmath70 is the attractive ( astrophysical ) case .",
    "the choice we must make is what sort of equilibrium solution to linearize about  which will greatly influence exactly what the potential @xmath137 should be .    the most natural choice is to linearize about a sufficiently nice , time - independent solution , @xmath138 , of rvp ( i.e. we consider solutions of the form @xmath139 for small @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , there are a number of issues which make an analysis in this case difficult .",
    "if we write down a formal solution via duhamel s principle , take the fourier transform in the spatial variable , and integrate out the momentum variable , we find two major obstacles .",
    "first , the spatial transform will involve convolutions of the spatial transforms of @xmath140 and @xmath141 with transforms of analogous quantities coming from the equilibrium solution .",
    "hence , the time evolution of @xmath142 will no longer evolve independently of the rest of the spectrum .",
    "second , integration of @xmath140 ( or its transform in @xmath111 ) against @xmath93 does not give a quantity nicely related to @xmath143 , and so we do not get a nice volterra equation for @xmath142 .    the other option is to take a kinetic equilibrium , @xmath11 , which is uniform in the spatial variable .",
    "this is , of course , much less reasonable from a physical viewpoint than the set - up above .",
    "however , if the spatial support of the perturbation , @xmath75 , is quite small compared to a natural length scale for a given inhomogeneous equilibrium @xmath138 ( or at least if the bulk of the perturbation lies in a compact set which is small on such a scale ) , then the fiction of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium is not entirely unreasonable . however , we must assume that this spatially uniform equilibrium makes no contribution to the poisson equation .",
    "in the plasma - physics setting , this is usually accomplished by assuming there is a background neutralizing charge distribution ( which is no more unreasonable than taking a uniform equilibrium @xmath16 ) . for the astrophysics case ,",
    "this assumption is often referred to as the `` jeans swindle . '' as noted by kiessling @xcite , this assumption can be rigorously justified by an appropriate limiting procedure coupled with the fact that it is the forces ( rather than the potential itself ) which are important to the dynamics .",
    "given that such a maneuver is valid , if we linearize about a sufficiently nice , uniform kinetic equilibrium we obtain : @xmath144 with the boundary condition that @xmath145 as @xmath146 .",
    "this is essentially the same as what we found on the torus ( and so many of the computations will be identical ) .",
    "formally , we can once again employ the construction used on the torus to ensure that @xmath147 ( i.e. the neutral variation assumption ) .",
    "however , the resultant @xmath148 will no longer decay nicely at infinity ( unless , of course , @xmath77 does not decay at infinity  which stands in contradiction to the spirit of using the homogeneous equilibrium in the first place ) . hence",
    ", we will not make this assumption for @xmath77 in the whole space @xmath0 .",
    "this will not be a serious impediment to the analysis going forward .",
    "we should mention that the linearized flow is such that @xmath149    once again , we can give a formal solution to the linearized rvp equation through duhamel s principle : @xmath150 where @xmath151    for the fourier transform , we take as our convention @xmath152 taking the transform of both sides of we arrive at @xmath153 integrating in @xmath93 , we see that @xmath154 and @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath157 .",
