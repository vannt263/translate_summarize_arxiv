    "epidermis , the outer layer of the skin , has a stratified organization and is named according to the visual appearance under optical microscope ( fig .",
    "[ fig.sc.schematic].a ) .",
    "the _ stratum corneum _ ( sc ) is the outermost layer of the epidermis , comprising dead pancake - like flattened cells ( corneocytes ) in a lipid matrix .",
    "keratinocytes , the dominant cell type in the _ stratum basale _ , the innermost layer of epidermis , migrate through the intervening layers while changing in shape and content . in the _ stratum granulosum _ , immediately below the sc , keratinocytes over - produce keratin and secrete specialized lipids . by the time keratinocytes migrate to sc , the neuclei and other internal organelles disintegrate and the cell attains a comparatively rigid structure through keratin network .",
    "the dead keratinocytes are called corneocytes .",
    "the lipid matrix in the sc provides the main barrier against water loss and invasion of foreign pathogens [ 1 ] .",
    "the lipid matrix in the extracellular space of the corneocytes shows a multilamellar structure in electron microscopy ( fig .",
    "[ fig.sc.schematic].b ) [ 2 ] .",
    "this multilamellar structure is often punctuated by _",
    "lacunar spaces _ where the periodic structure in electron density is lost .",
    "the lipids adjacent to the corenocytes are covalently bound to the protein network of the corneocytes forming the _ corneocyte - bound lipid envelope _",
    "( cle ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig.sc.schematic].c ) , which shows up as electron - dense regions in electron microscopy .",
    "the main components of the sc lipid matrix are the ceramide sphingolipids ( cer ) , cholesterol ( chol ) and free fatty acid ( ffa ) .",
    "there are 11 families of cer molecules found in the sc ( fig .",
    "[ fig.cer.family ] ) , differing by the numbers and the positions of the hydroxyl groups .",
    "each member of these cer families shows additional polydispersity in the number of carbons in the fatty acid tail motif , leading to more than 300 different cer molecules [ 6 ] .",
    "we refer to the molecules by their family names followed by the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid motif .",
    "thus , cer  ns  24 refers to cer  ns with lignoceric acid as the fatty acid motif .",
    "similarly the different ffa molecules are distinguished by the number of carbon atoms . in the literature",
    ", ceramide familes often are distinguished by the order of their appearance in the chromatograph : cer  eos is often refereed to as ceramide 1 , cer  ns as ceramide 2 and cer  np as ceramide 3 .",
    "all simulations were carried out with the molecular dynamics software gromacs [ 7,8 ] with nos - hoover thermostats separately coupled to the lipid molecules and the water molecules , and with a parrinello - rahman barostat .",
    "bond lengths were constrained with the lincs algorithm for the lipid molecules and with the settle algorithm for water molecules .",
    "the time steps for md simulations were 2  fs .",
    "we used the ` berger ' force - field [ 9 ] for the lipid molecules , which accurately reproduces experimental results for different lipid systems [ 10 ] .",
    "we have used the same force - field in the past for simulations of a smaller subset of sc lipid molecules for studying small fully hydrated bilayers and water permeation [ 11,12 ] .",
    "water is modeled with the spc potential [ 13 ] .",
    "the partial charges used are shown in fig.[fig.sup.charge ] .",
    "we use a group - based cut - off with the cut - off length @xmath16 for both the van  der waals and electrostatic interactions . in our previous simulations",
    "[ 11 ] , we have explicitly compared simulations involving a group - based cut - off with particle - mesh ewald summation ( pme ) simulations .",
    "the effect of the long range electrostatics was found to be negligible . in simulations of lipid bilayers",
    ", long range electrostatics often plays an important role .",
    "the reasons for the negligible contribution of long range electrostatics in our simulations are two - fold : firstly , the sc lipids are uncharged at skin ph , with only small partial charges contributing to the electrostatic interaction .",
    "thus , the dipole moments involved are about @xmath17 times smaller than the typical phospholipid dipole created from well separated n@xmath18 and p@xmath19 charges .",
    "secondly phospholipid dipoles have a component normal to the water - lipid interface , which can give rise to a macroscopic dipole moment .",
    "by contrast , the small dipoles from the partial charges in the sc lipid system , even in a bilayer arrangement , orient themselves in random directions .",
    "thus , the effect of the electrostatic interaction beyond the cut - off becomes much smaller than the thermal energy .",
    ".numbers of molecules used in the simulations . for the sets",
    "a and b , we use three different initial configurations .",
    "the three configurations from set a are referred to as sets aa , ab and ac . a similar suffix is used for set b. [ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     table  [ tab.molnum ] gives the number of molecules used in the different simulations .",
    "guided by the mass - spectroscopic profiles for the ceramides [ 14,15 ] , we choose a fixed molar ratio 1:5:4 for the cer  eos : cer  ns : cer  np . in doing so , we assume that the ceramides with esterified @xmath20-hydroxy fatty acids ( cer  eos , cer  eoh and cer  eop ) behave similarly and cer  eos alone represents all three of these families in our simulations .",
    "similarly , ceramides that do not have such esterified fatty acid and have a double bond in the sphingosine motif are represented by cer  ns .",
    "cer  np accounts for rest of the ceramides ( all of which do not have double bonds in the sphingosine motif ) . set  a and set  c consider cer , chol and ffa in 1:1:1 molar ratio .",
    "set  b considers a molar ratio of cer : chol : ffa = 2:2:1 . set  a and set  b",
    "contains 30 wt% water . in both of these two sets ( a and b )",
    ", three separate simulations were performed with different initial conditions , which we will distinguish as set  aa , set  ab and so on . set  c",
    "was used to look at the stability of pre - formed multilayer arrangements ( details follow in s2.4 ) .",
    "configurations with a single molecule of each of the lipid species were energy minimized in vacuum separately .",
    "for the simulations in sets a and b , a large simulation box was divided into small grids with dimensions large enough to accommodate the longest lipid species .",
    "the desired number of energy - minimized lipid molecules were placed with random orientations in randomly selected unoccupied grid points .",
    "we maintain a finer grid which notes occupied sites by individual lipid atoms .",
    "the required number of water molecules were placed with random orientations at randomly chosen unoccupied sites of the fine grid .",
    "the configurations were energy minimized and evolved with npt md steps using a nose - hoover thermostat and a parrinello - rahman barostat for @xmath21 at 340  k. standard periodic boundary conditions in a cubic simulation box and isotropic pressure coupling were used in all cases except for set bc .    for one of the 2:2:1 composition system ( set  bc ) , we selected a rectangular box with @xmath22 dimensions nearly four times larger than the @xmath12 direction ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "once the initial ` gas'-phase system reached atmospheric pressure , an anisotropic barostat with a large ( 1000 bar ) pressure applied along the @xmath22 directions and atmospheric pressure applied in the @xmath12 direction was used to achieve a nearly cubic box .",
    "the resulting deformation aligns the long molecules preferentially along the @xmath12 direction . after this , the pressure couplings were set to atmospheric pressure in all three directions and the system was evolved for @xmath21 at 340  k. the initial alignment did not affect the transition to the final inverse micellar arrangement with on average isotropic lipid orientations .",
    "we evolved this set  bc for a further 50  ns at an elevated temperature of 350  k and then finally for another 100  ns at 300  k. the inverse micellar arrangement was found to be robust under change in temperature .",
    "the final configurations of the different sets are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.seta.fin ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.setb.fin ] .      in the final inverse micellar configuration of set  bc we selected a @xmath25 zone , within which the water molecules were frozen along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "we repeatedly carried out short ( @xmath26 ) nvt simulations and identified any new water molecules drifting in the selected zone .",
    "these water molecules in turn were added to the frozen list .",
    "locally this creates enough perturbation to move the lipid molecules out of this zone .",
    "only a few lipid tails stay stuck in the frozen water layer .",
    "they were pulled out of the water layer by moving them at a constant speed ( 0.01  nm / ps ) away from the water layer . the configuration created by this process",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.fzsol ]  a. the inverse micellar structure away from the frozen water layer remain unchanged during further evolution ( 50  ns , fig .",
    "[ fig.fzsol ]  b ) .",
    "the frozen water layer allows us to introduce a wall along the @xmath12-direction mimicking a continuous distribution of water molecules .",
    "the walls interact with the atoms as an integrated lennard - jones ( 9 - 3 ) potential with interaction parameters chosen to be that of atom type ow ( oxygen of water ) at density 33.44 atoms / nm@xmath27 . after 50  ns of npt simulation ,",
    "no qualitative change in the lipid arrangement was observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig.fzsol ]  b ) .    in sc",
    ", the lipids between highly hygroscopic corneocytes are essentially free of water [ 16 ] .",
    "to simulate at conditions similar to that between corneocytes , we _ dry _ the lipid structure by slowly removing the inner water molecules ( 10 randomly water molecules were removed every 100  ps of npt simulation ) , and evolve the system for another 50  ns with a continuous water wall .",
    "the anisotropy introduced by the walls along the @xmath12-direction changes the box dimension significantly ( fig .",
    "no signature of layering was observed .",
    "specifically , the hydrocarbon tails were found to be equally likely to be parallel to the wall as perpendicular to the wall for lipids close to the boundaries .    in the sc , a layer of ceramide molecules",
    "are covalently bonded to the proteins in corneocyte .",
    "thus the cle surface presents itself as a well aligned layer of ceramide head groups to the stratum corneum lipids . in our next step",
    "we try to mimic this surface .",
    "first we replace the continuous wall with a layer of spc water molecules ( 24000 molecules ) and use 100  ns of npt simulation .",
    "discrete water molecules provide transient hydrogen bonds that align the lipids closest to the boundary , and the lipid tails align predominantly along the @xmath12-direction ( fig .  [ fig.discwall ] ) . from a separate simulation of a hydrated bilayer comprising cer  ns  24:0 , a single molecule with",
    "a hairpin conformation was isolated .",
    "the head group ( atoms between c16 till o26 ) was duplicated ( as atoms c41 till o51 ) . the new copy of the head group was mirrored first about @xmath12-axis and then about the nitrogen atom .",
    "finally the new group was given a rigid translation by identifying the terminal ch3 group of the fatty acid chain of original molecule as c41 of the duplicated head group .",
    "we term this artificial lipid molecule crw .",
    "because of the symmetry of this molecule , it has zero curvature and a flat layer structure will be its preferred arrangement .",
    "all interaction parameters of the new second head group are identical to the first head group .",
    "the molecule was placed in vacuum and energy minimized .    the existing lipid box in which we wanted to include the crw wall had @xmath22 box dimensions of 13.37  nm @xmath3 12.10  nm . guided by the area / lipid of cer  2 bilayers [ 11 ]",
    ", we placed 408 crw molecules in a roughly triangular lattice with the @xmath22 dimensions of the box identical to the sc lipid system .",
    "we place two continuous water walls along the @xmath12-direction at separation of 3.8  nm .",
    "the molecules were energy minimized , and then equilibrated over 0.5  ns with nvt md simulations at 340k .",
    "this equilibrated clw layer was included in place of the water wall in the sc lipid box the configuration was energy minimized and evolved for further 1  @xmath2s at 340  k with npt simulation .",
    "the final configuration of this system is shown in the main body of the paper ( fig .",
    "close to the two walls , the figure shows aligned bilayers .",
    "further away from the walls , patches of bilayer can be seen that are not oriented with the wall .",
    "the long timescale of realignment of the interior bilayer patches may explain the long delay between the lipid release from sg and recovery of the permeability barrier .",
    "cer  ns tails are identical to sphingomyelin ( sm ) except for the absence of the phosphocholine head group .",
    "the absence of the phosphocholine headgroup leads to an area / lipid for the cer  ns molecules in a bilayer arrangement [ 11 ] that is only around 70% of that for sm in a hydrated bilayer [ 17 ] .",
    "since sm forms a stable bilayer , from geometric consideration alone [ 18 ] , one would expect cer to form an inverted phase .",
    "in fact , in all but one of the several crystal structures cer adopts a splayed chain arrangement [ 19 ] to release the packing frustration of accommodating a small head and comparatively bulky tails .",
    "while a small bilayer with full hydration is indefinitely stable in simulations , the local stress tensor across the bilayer contains information about the spontaneous curvature preferred by the molecules .",
    "the integral of the first moment of the difference in the lateral ( @xmath28 ) and the normal pressure ( @xmath29 ) profile is related to the spontaneous curvature @xmath14 and the bending elastic constant @xmath30 for ( half of ) the bilayer through [ 20 ] @xmath31 dz .",

    "also , different prefactors are used for different definitions of the bending modulus .",
    "calculation of the local microscopic pressure tensor is costly and we have not attempted such calculations for these simulations . however , we have re - analyzed the result of a cer  ns  24 hydrated bilayer and a 2:2:1 hydrated bilayer comprising cer  ns  24 , ffa  24 and chol from [ 11 ] . in fig  [ fig.sup.localp ]",
    "we show the lateral pressure profiles at 340k after smoothing the data by combining results from both the monolayers because of the up - down symmetry , and a further three point smoothing .    using the bending modulus values from",

    "the sign of the curvature points towards equilibrium inverse phases and the magnitude is similar to the length - scale of the observed checkerboard pattern in cryo - em [ 2 ] .",
    "separate leaflets with the same number of lipid molecules in each leaflet were prepared by randomly placing the lipid molecules with the cer tails in hairpin arrangements and with the head groups at the same @xmath12 .",
    "four such leaflets were energy minimized and joined to form a double bilayer structure with sufficient separation between the leaflets to accommodate the longest lipid species without overlap with the adjacent leaflet .",
    "continuous water wall was placed along the @xmath12-directions .",
    "the structure was repeatedly compressed in @xmath22 direction by 1% , the leaflets were moved closer to each other by 0.001  nm , and energy minimized .",
    "this ensures that the lipids remain in multilayer arrangement , while locally deforming to allow a liquid - like dense configuration .",
    "once the internal pressure reached one atmosphere , a layer of water ( 20000 molecules , @xmath37 ) was placed in place of the wall , and for 1  ns only the water molecules were evolved with nvt simulation while keeping the lipid molecules frozen . finally the constraints were removed and npt",

    "<S> a patterned wall mimicking the conrneocyte - bound lipid envelope induces layering in sc lipids . </S>",
    "<S> a continuous wall failed to induce layering , suggesting that the hydrogen - bonding with the wall molecules plays an important role in forming multilayered structures .    </S>",
    "<S> these simulations provide some rationale behind the synthesis pathway and the lipid structures found in the sc _ in  vivo_. the seemingly unnecessary step of adding and removing a sugar group @xcite becomes meaningful by noting that the ceramide lipids would have formed an inverse micellar phase if left without a large head group inside the cells in the sg , and thus frustrate the vesicle trafficking mechanism necessary for their release . </S>",
    "<S> once the sugar group is removed , if the molecules remain in the water - rich sg - sc boundary region they can form an inverse micellar phase , leading to the granular pattern seen in cryo - em @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these water - containing inverted structures may play a role in the activity of anti - microbial peptides that are released along with the lipid molecules @xcite and possibly are responsible for higher permeability in skin regions lacking corneocyte stacks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such non - lamellar structures have also been observed in some _ in  vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> depositions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when transported into the region between corneocyte walls , the patterned surface and confinement leads to a lamellar structure . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of this lamellar structure is necessarily slow because of low molecular mobility in the crowded confined environment . from _ in  vivo _ measurement of recovery of permeability barrier , we expect the time - scale of this patterned wall induced ordering to be of order days @xcite and the rate limiting step in the recovery process . </S>",
    "<S> the polydispersity stops the lipids from forming crystalline structures , thus providing some plasticity and dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the polydisperse tails also lower the defect energies ( as evidenced by the diffuse defect structure in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.mult.unstable]d ) so that the lipids can envelope the corneocytes in three dimensions without forming strongly localised defects and thereby compromising the barrier .    </S>",
