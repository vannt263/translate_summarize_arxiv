    "in recent years the number of extrasolar transiting planets has expanded considerably , with discoveries being made at a rapid pace both from the ground and increasingly also from space by the _",
    "corot _ and _ kepler _ missions . with this large assembly of data , studies have begun to focus on examining patterns and correlations among the global properties of these planets and their parent stars , and what this can tell us about planet formation and evolution .",
    "while the characteristics of some of these systems are very well known ( e.g. , hd209458 , hd189733 , tres-1 ) , those of others are much less well determined and have remained so since their discovery .",
    "our knowledge of the planetary properties depends critically on understanding the parent stars .",
    "this is because , for transiting systems , the light curves only give information on the size of the planet relative to that of the star ( @xmath2 ) , and spectroscopic observations only reveal the mass of the planet if we know the mass of the star ( @xmath3 ) . the stellar mass and radius , in turn ,",
    "depend on other properties that can be gleaned from the stars spectra such as the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath1 ) , and chemical composition ( commonly represented by [ fe / h ] ) .    for many of the known transiting planet systems ,",
    "follow - up photometric observations have been undertaken after the initial discovery of the planet , usually for the purpose of measuring the times of mid - transit and seeking departures from strict periodicity ( transit timing variations ) that may indicate the presence of additional bodies in the system .",
    "these new transit light curve observations have also served to improve the radius determinations in many cases .",
    "however , it is much less common for known transiting systems to be re - observed spectroscopically . as a result",
    ", our knowledge of the stellar properties is often limited by whatever information was reported in the discovery papers , which is sometimes preliminary .",
    "inaccuracies in the stellar @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] propagate through to the determination of the planetary properties , and may obscure correlations with other quantities and prevent us from gaining valuable insight into the nature of planets . to make matters worse , the methods of determining @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] in the literature are highly inhomogeneous , as they have been carried out by many groups using different assumptions and methodologies .    in one of the few studies to redetermine spectroscopic properties for transiting planet hosts in a uniform way",
    ", @xcite obtained new temperatures , surface gravities , and metallicities for 13 systems based on new or existing spectra .",
    "they combined their determinations with those for 11 additional systems made by others using similar techniques , and compiled a list of 24 host stars with uniformly derived properties .",
    "comparison with results for the same stars by other groups uncovered significant systematic differences in some cases , the causes of which are unknown .",
    "one of the motivations for the present paper is to derive spectroscopic properties in a homogeneous manner for a much larger sample of more than 50 transiting planet hosts , and thereby reduce any dispersion in the stellar and planetary properties that is caused by the variety of methodologies used in the past . for this",
    "we make use of the stellar parameter classification ( spc ) technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "we also wish to understand potential systematic errors in such determinations .",
    "in particular , it has been recognized for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that surface gravities are often poorly constrained by spectral analyses .",
    "this is an unfortunate limitation , because the surface gravity would otherwise help to establish the luminosity of the star ( and hence its radius ) by placing it on the h - r diagram .    in cases for which the surface gravity is poorly constrained",
    ", the use of an external constraint on the luminosity becomes very important to allow accurate determinations of the mass and radius of the star .",
    "however , a detail that has usually been overlooked is that the determinations of other spectroscopic quantities such as the temperature and metallicity can _ also _ be affected by the poor constraint on gravity .",
    "this is because the uncertainties in @xmath4 and [ fe / h ] are strongly correlated with @xmath1 in at least some of the commonly used analysis techniques .",
    "this can be a significant source of systematic error .",
    "therefore , a second goal of our work is to compare spectroscopic determinations for a subset of the sample obtained using two additional procedures widely employed in previous studies , and to investigate and quantify systematics errors stemming from the weakly constrained gravities .",
    "ultimately the stellar quantities that enter into the calculation of the planetary characteristics are the masses and radii inferred from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] , as mentioned earlier .",
    "a third objective of the present paper is to study and quantify how errors in the spectroscopic properties propagate into the stellar masses and radii .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "for this work we have relied in part on new spectra collected with the tres instrument @xcite on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( mount hopkins , az ) , and also on publicly available spectra obtained with the hires instrument @xcite on the keck  i telescope ( mauna kea , hi ) and with the fies instrument @xcite on the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( la palma , spain ) . the archival spectra have generally not been used previously for a determination of the stellar properties , and even when they have , we have redetermined those properties here using different methodologies for comparison purposes .",

    "* ) are such that for an increase of 0.5  dex in @xmath1 the temperatures change systematically by about + 310k for spc and + 350k for sme . for a similar increase in @xmath1",
    "the metallicities from spc and sme both change by about + 0.19  dex .",
    "these correlations are hardly significant for moog : the formal changes per 0.5  dex increase in surface gravity are only + 70k and + 0.04  dex in @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] , respectively , which are of the order of the typical internal errors or smaller .",
    "we note also that there is some evidence that these correlations depend on temperature , in the sense that for stars cooler than the sun they are roughly half as large .",
    "spc and sme are somewhat similar techniques in the sense that they both optimize @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] by seeking the best match between the observed spectrum and a synthetic spectrum .",
    "the correlations described above are not completely unexpected in these procedures , as one spectroscopic quantity can play against another to some extent and lead to nearly the same cross - correlation value or @xmath14 value . for example , stronger lines produced by adopting a higher metallicity for the synthetic spectrum can be compensated for , to first order , by a suitable increase in the effective temperature . a similar degeneracy exists between surface gravity and temperature . in the case of moog",
    "the effect of these correlations is evidently much weaker .",
    "a significant difference between moog and the other methods is the line lists .",
    "in particular , for this work moog uses only and lines , whereas sme additionally includes the region of the b triplet , and spc relies heavily on this same spectral region as well .",
    "therefore for the two latter methods the b lines contain by far the strongest information on @xmath63 . we speculate that any errors in the synthesis of the broad wings of these pressure - sensitive lines may cause errors in the spc and sme determinations that would likely also impact the @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] values because of the correlations described above ; moog , on the other hand , would be unaffected .",
    "while we have no evidence of such errors at the present time , this could be investigated by using different atmospheric models .",
    "we note also that the surface gravity in the unconstrained moog analysis is determined implicitly by requiring that the iron abundance for and from the measured equivalent widths be the same ( ionization equilibrium ) .",
    "when fixing @xmath1 to a value determined externally this condition is generally no longer met , although the discrepancy for our sample ( about 0.05dex , on average ) is small compared to the nominal uncertainty in the abundance .",
    "this lack of ionization equilibrium seems to have little effect on the other parameters , and could be a sign of real differences between and ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , or deficiencies in the models @xcite .",
    "for all three methods we find that the goodness of fit ( as quantified by @xmath14 or the average cross - correlation coefficient ) is only slightly lower in the constrained fits compared to those in which @xmath1 is left free .",
    "differences between the results with unconstrained surface gravities and those using the density - based values were found to be up to 0.5  dex for spc and sme , and up to 0.3  dex for moog . to the extent that the photometric constraints on @xmath31 ( and therefore @xmath1 ) are accurate",
    ", this suggests that all three spectroscopic procedures are vulnerable to systematics , though perhaps not to the same degree or for the same reasons .",
    "indirect evidence of these effects may perhaps be seen already in published results from the two surveys that have produced the majority of the transiting planet discoveries from the ground : the wasp project @xcite and the hatnet project @xcite .",
    "the hatnet group has generally used sme for the spectroscopic analysis of the parent stars , and in most cases the studies have been iterated as described above , using the constraint from the transit light curves to set @xmath1 .",
    "the wasp team has occasionally also used sme , although more recently they have relied on the uclsyn package @xcite and in general their spectroscopic results are from an unconstrained analysis ( @xmath1 free ) .",
    "a comparison of the distribution of published metallicities for the host stars from these two groups is seen in figure  [ fig : wasphat ] .",
    "the average metallicities differ by about 0.17  dex , and a kolmogorov - smirnov test suggests the distributions are statistically different , with a false alarm probability ( fap ) of 0.14% .",
    "both surveys are magnitude limited , with the wasp program being typically shallower , so a difference in the metallicity distributions is possible in principle . however , we find that the mean visual magnitude of the two star samples is essentially the same ( @xmath64 for wasp and @xmath65 for hatnet ) , and a k - s test indicates the brightness distributions are indistinguishable ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that the difference in the average metallicities is mostly due to the analysis .",
    "it goes in the direction expected , as the constrained @xmath1 values adopted by the hatnet team are more often larger than the unconstrained values , which according to figure  [ fig : correlations ] should lead to higher metallicities in that survey , just as observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : teff ] shows that for spc and sme the differences between the constrained and unconstrained results for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] are a function of the temperature of the star . in the case of sme",
    "the external surface gravities for stars up to roughly 6000k tend to be lower than the unconstrained values , on average , and in turn lead to systematically lower temperatures and metallicities . for hotter stars",
    "the trend reverses sharply , reaching maximum differences of 0.5  dex in @xmath1 , 400k in @xmath0 , and 0.2  dex in metallicity compared to those with @xmath1 free . for spc",
    "the external @xmath1 values differ somewhat less from the unconstrained determinations , but again the hotter stars give higher temperatures and [ fe / h ] values when imposing this constraint .",
    "no such dependence is apparent for the moog results .",
    "we also found no significant dependence of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath69}$ ] with either metallicity or surface gravity , in any of the three methods .",
    "the projected rotational velocities from spc and sme are insensitive to the change in @xmath1 .    as mentioned above the trends in spc and sme with effective temperature",
    "are most likely related to the fact that the information on surface gravity in these methods comes almost exclusively from the pressure - broadened wings of the b lines at @xmath55200 . for stars hotter than about 6000k the wings of these lines",
    "weaken considerably , and the methods lose sensitivity to @xmath1 .",
    "it is less clear why the bias in @xmath1 for such stars is toward smaller values , as opposed to being toward higher values or simply having a larger scatter . in any case",
    ", the positive correlation between @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and [ fe / h ] explains the upturn in the last two quantities in figure  [ fig : teff ] .    as a result of the temperature correlation for spc and sme shown in figure  [ fig : teff ] , the net effect of applying the @xmath1 constraint with those methods is to shift the stars in the h - r diagram towards a less evolved state ( closer to the zero - age main sequence ) .",
    "the less evolved state also seems more likely _ a priori _ , because of the slower speed of evolution for unevolved stars .",
    "we illustrate this for sme in figure  [ fig : hrsme ] .",
    "the trend has a significant impact on the inferred radii of the stars , which we discuss more quantitatively in sect .",
    "[ sec : impact ] .",
    "the constrained results from the different methods are compared in figure  [ fig : constrained ] for stars in common .",
    "our expectation was that the methods would show better agreement than the unconstrained results , since some of the biases in the determination of @xmath4 and [ fe / h ] that are intrinsic to each of the techniques would be reduced by enforcing an external constraint on @xmath1 .",
    "this is indeed the case , although residual trends can still be seen in some of the panels of figure  [ fig : constrained ] , such as between moog and sme in [ fe / h ] , or between spc and sme in temperature and also metallicity .",
    "these are most likely a reflection of strong correlations between the spectroscopic parameters that are present in at least two of the methods ( spc and sme ) , as already described , and the different degrees to which the three procedures respond to the imposition of an external @xmath1 constraint .",
    "many details of the spectroscopic analysis are likely to influence the results in ways that are difficult to predict or quantify .",
    "this includes the accuracy of the continuum normalization of the spectra , the model atmospheres used , the adopted line lists , and the sensitivity to the snr of the spectra , which varies from method to method .",
    "nevertheless , average differences between the final values from spc , sme , and moog remain quite small , as seen in table  [ tab : dif_const ] .",
    "lccc spc@xmath18sme & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & 44 + spc@xmath18moog & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & 36 + sme@xmath18moog & @xmath74 & @xmath75 & 29 + [ -2ex ]      the sensitivity of spc and sme to changes in the surface gravity suggests these techniques are more susceptible to systematic bias than moog , although @xmath1 errors up to 0.3  dex occur even with moog .",
    "the smaller impact of those errors on @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] in the latter method does not necessarily guarantee those quantities are free from bias .",
    "it is difficult to ascertain whether the results from one technique are more accurate than another .",
    "independent checks on the temperatures could in principle be obtained from the measurement of bolometric fluxes and precise interferometric angular diameters , but the stars in the present sample are generally too faint for current long - baseline interferometers .",
    "photometric temperature estimates based on color indices might provide an alternative , but suffer from the possibility of reddening , which is unknown for most of these stars .    given that the average systematic differences in table  [ tab : dif_const ] between the three methodologies are relatively small , the final spectroscopic parameters we adopted for stars analyzed with more than one method or observed using more than one instrument is the weighted mean , which should not significantly affect the homogeneity of the results .",
    "we collect the final parameters for 56 transiting planet hosts in table  [ tab : finalresults ] , where the uncertainties include a contribution added in quadrature from the overall scatter of the measurements available for stars with multiple determinations .",
    "these added dispersions are @xmath76k , @xmath77 } = 0.062$]dex , and @xmath78",

    "prior to this study , the largest effort to determine spectroscopic parameters for transiting planet hosts in a homogeneous way was that of @xcite , who used moog following the precepts of @xcite .",
    "our sample and theirs have 14 stars in common .",
    "a comparison of our results from table  [ tab : finalresults ] with theirs is seen in figure  [ fig : ammler1 ] , where the differences in @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath1 for these 14 stars are plotted in the sense @xmath98ammler - von eiff minus table  [ tab : finalresults]@xmath99 . as indicated earlier",
    "our adopted surface gravities are the density - based values , not the spectroscopic values .",
    "the temperatures on the horizontal axis of the figure are from our own determinations .",
    "although the sample is small , there appears to be a significant systematic difference in the surface gravities that correlates with temperature ( bottom panel ) , such that @xcite measure a higher @xmath1 for the hotter stars .",
    "it is difficult to see how a bias in our @xmath1 values from table  [ tab : finalresults ] could cause this , as those determinations rest essentially on the @xmath30 measurements from the transit light curves .",
    "there may also be a trend of @xmath67 with temperature ( top panel ) , though it seems marginal .",
    "for the metallicities there is no significant correlation with temperature , but we note that _ all _ of the @xcite values of [ fe / h ] are higher than ours , the average difference being @xmath100  dex .",
    "in figure  [ fig : hrsme ] above we presented a graphical illustration of how the inferred evolutionary state of the star can change considerably as a result of applying the external ( photometric ) constraint on @xmath1 in the spectroscopic analysis . as might be expected , this can also lead to significant changes in the mass and radius derived for the star , which are of more immediate interest for computing planetary properties in transiting planet systems .    to explore this",
    "more quantitatively we have derived stellar masses and radii for the same stars shown in figure  [ fig : hrsme ] following the common procedure of comparing the spectroscopic quantities @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] against stellar evolution models . for each star we performed a monte carlo simulation in which we drew 10,000 values of the three spectroscopic parameters from gaussian distributions characterized by the measured values and observational errors , assuming they are uncorrelated .",
    "we compared each set with isochrones from the yonsei - yale series by @xcite , seeking the best match in a @xmath14 sense .",
    "ages were allowed to vary in steps of 0.1  gyr over the range from 0.1 to 13.7  gyr , and the @xmath13-element abundance was assumed to be solar for this test ( [ @xmath13/fe ] = 0.0 ) .",
    "stellar masses and radii were determined from the mode of the respective posterior probability distributions , and 1-@xmath101 lower and upper confidence limits were defined by the 15.85% and 84.15% percentiles of the cumulative distribution .",
    "we carried out these calculations first using the unconstrained sme results , and then repeated the process with the constrained results .",
    "a comparison between @xmath28 and @xmath29 from these two sets of parameters is shown in figure  [ fig : comparemruc1 ] as a function of @xmath102 , where the changes are displayed both in absolute units and as a percentage . in the most extreme cases",
    "the unconstrained radii can be off by up to 100% .",
    "this occurs for the hotter stars , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : hrsme ] .",
    "the impact on the mass is also not negligible , reaching @xmath515% in some cases .",
    "errors of this magnitude are almost always larger than other observational errors .",
    "very similar results were obtained using the spc determinations .",
    "the importance of this bias coming from the reliance on the weakly determined spectroscopic @xmath1 is now widely recognized in the community , and is largely avoided in current analyses of transiting planets by adopting instead the density - based @xmath1 to infer @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , many of those same studies still retain the temperatures and metallicities from _ unconstrained _ spectroscopic analyses in which the surface gravity was left free .",
    "because @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] typically suffer from strong correlations , as shown earlier in figure  [ fig : correlations ] , those values have a residual bias that is often not negligible and can propagate to the stellar masses and radii",
    ". this bias has been generally overlooked .",
    "we have quantified this systematic effect by repeating the determination of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the same sample above using the photometry - based @xmath1 , but deliberately adopting @xmath4 and [ fe / h ] from the unconstrained spectroscopic analysis , to emulate the procedure often followed in published studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparemrmc1 ] compares these masses and radii with those based on our second iteration of sme , in which the temperature and metallicity were redetermined using the external @xmath1 constraint .",
    "there are clear differences in the stellar properties that mimic those seen in figure  [ fig : teff ] .",
    "we conclude that even if a more accurate @xmath1 is adopted for inferring @xmath28 and @xmath29 from evolutionary models , using the unconstrained values of the temperatures and metallicities rather than those from a second iteration of the spectroscopic analysis can still lead to stellar masses that are up to 20% too large , and radii that are overestimated by as much as 10% for the hotter stars . since planetary properties from doppler and light - curve analyses have dependencies @xmath103 and @xmath2",
    ", the above errors can translate into biases ( overestimates ) of 13% and 10% in the planetary masses and radii . for cooler stars",
    "the errors tend to be in the opposite direction , and are smaller .",
    "analogous results were obtained when using the determinations from spc . in the case of moog , on the other hand , the effect on @xmath28 and @xmath29 from using unconstrained temperatures and metallicities is only marginally significant , consistent with the much smaller correlations seen in figure  [ fig : correlations ] .",
    "we defer a comprehensive examination and tabulation of stellar masses and radii for a future paper , since we are also compiling many new light curves for analysis , which may improve the external constraints .",
    "while most transiting planet investigations use stellar evolution models to infer stellar masses and radii , others use empirical relations for @xmath28 and @xmath29 as a function of temperature , metallicity , and mean density .",
    "the biases described above can affect both .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission is increasingly making use of asteroseismology as an alternate way of deriving the mean stellar density , based on oscillation frequencies measured directly from the light curves in favorable cases . deriving the stellar mass or radius with this technique still requires stellar models , as well as accurate measurements of @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] , so there is still a danger of systematic errors from the use of unconstrained spectroscopic determinations .",
    "numerous investigations have addressed the persistent problem of the anomalously `` inflated '' radii of some of the jovian planets  objects that can exceed 60% of the size of jupiter in extreme cases  which has been with us since the discovery of transits in hd  209458 , challenging our understanding of planet formation and evolution .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed that may play a role in `` puffing up '' the planets , but no universal process seems to account for all of these anomalies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our results in the preceding section suggest that a portion of the discrepancy in @xmath104 may have to do with systematic errors in the stellar radii in some cases , which can amount to @xmath510% , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : comparemrmc1 ] .",
    "one of the notorious examples of inflated planets for which we have derived new spectroscopic parameters is wasp-12b , with a radius of @xmath105 @xcite . , adopting the same spectroscopic parameters as the original authors . ]",
    "this study of wasp-12b adopted spectroscopic properties derived from an unconstrained sme analysis yielding @xmath106k ( rounded off by the authors to 6300k , and assigned errors of @xmath107k ) and @xmath108 } = + 0.30^{+0.05}_{-0.15}$ ] .",
    "these are both somewhat higher than we derive here from our constrained spectroscopic analyses : @xmath109k and @xmath110 } = + 0.07 \\pm 0.07 $ ] .",
    "we note that their spectroscopic surface gravity ( @xmath111 ) is also larger than the density - based ( photometrically constrained ) value they reported , @xmath112 .",
    "these differences are all consistent with the magnitude and sign of correlations shown in figure  [ fig : correlations ] , and leave open the possibility that the stellar mass and radius of @xcite may be biased . to test this we repeated their isochrone analysis using the yonsei - yale stellar evolution models of @xcite ,",
    "first with the @xcite temperature and metallicity , and then adopting ours .",
    "the surface gravity was held fixed at the density - based value they determined .",
    "the stellar radius we obtained with our revised spectroscopic parameters is 5% smaller , implying a planetary radius also 5% smaller , all else being equal .",
    "while this correction is far from what would be needed to solve the puzzle of the inflated radius of wasp-12b , it does go in the right direction .",
    "accurate knowledge of the properties of the host stars in transiting exoplanet systems is essential to derive accurate characteristics for the planets .",
    "considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the light curves of newly discovered as well as previously known transiting systems , but relatively little attention has been paid to refining the spectroscopic properties of the stars .    here",
    "we have derived new effective temperatures , metallicities , and projected rotational velocities for 56 transiting planet systems in a homogeneous manner , using the spc technique .",
    "these determinations bring a needed measure of uniformity to the growing collection of stellar and planetary properties that should facilitate the discovery of patterns and correlations that may provide valuable insight into the nature of planets .",
    "a key aspect of our spectral analysis is the application of an external constraint on the surface gravity , based on accurate knowledge of the mean stellar density of the star , which comes directly from the light curve modeling .",
    "because @xmath1 is usually weakly constrained by the spectra , fixing it as we have done here prevents errors in @xmath1 from biasing the temperatures and metallicities , and from affecting the inferred stellar masses and radii .",
    "those biases come mainly from strong correlations between @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath1 that are present in unconstrained determinations ( @xmath1 free ) , not only when applying spc , but also in the widely used sme procedure as implemented by @xcite .",
    "both of these methods are based on spectral synthesis .",
    "we find that the correlations are much smaller with moog , which uses a more classical curve - of - growth approach .",
    "we investigate the interagreement among the three spectroscopic techniques by applying sme and moog to subsets of our stars , and we show that the temperatures and metallicities are generally in good accord after application of the @xmath1 constraint ( the mean differences being well under 50k and 0.1  dex , respectively ) .",
    "we do , however , detect some remaining systematic trends as a function of temperature and metallicity that are occasionally larger in some regimes .",
    "virtually all current studies of transiting planets make use of the mean stellar density as a luminosity indicator to derive the stellar properties , either through a comparison with model isochrones , or using empirical relations .",
    "we demonstrate that not using @xmath31 can incur errors in mass of up to 20% , and errors in the radius as large as 100% in some cases .",
    "even though such errors are now usually avoided , many authors still retain the temperatures and metallicities obtained from _ unconstrained _ spectroscopic analyses , i.e. , without fixing @xmath1 to the more accurate values based on the light curve modeling .",
    "we demonstrate that this practice can lead to residual biases in @xmath28 of up to 20% , and systematic errors in @xmath29 up to 10% for the hotter stars , which will propagate through to the planetary properties .",
    "such errors can be larger than other observational uncertainties , and may explain part of radius anomaly of some of the inflated jovian planets . in order to avoid this , we advocate performing a second iteration on the spectroscopic analysis ( particularly when using spc or sme ) that fixes @xmath1 to the value inferred from the photometrically determined mean stellar density",

    "<S> the spc and sme results , both based on comparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra , show strong correlations between @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath1 when solving for all three quantities simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the moog results , based on a more traditional curve - of - growth approach , show no such correlations . to combat the correlations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities , we repeat the spc analysis with a constraint on @xmath1 based on the mean stellar density that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have been subject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and 10% , respectively , which can be larger than other observational uncertainties , and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius . </S>"
