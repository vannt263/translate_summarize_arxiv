    "possible existence of exotic mesons consisting of two quarks and two anti - quarks was first suggested by jaffe in the framework of the mit bag model @xcite . since then , there have been continuous discussions on whether the mesons in the scalar nonet are candidates for such tetraquark mesons .",
    "recently , interest in tetraquark mesons has been extended to include those containing heavy quarks @xcite , as several heavy mesons , that were observed in @xmath2 meson decays , do not seem to fit well within the conventional quark model @xcite .",
    "tetraquark mesons with two heavy anti - quarks ( @xmath3 ) , henceforth called @xmath4 , are particularly interesting as they are explicitly exotic from flavor considerations @xcite . moreover",
    ", simple theoretical consideration based on the color - spin interaction @xcite shows that for such configurations the binding energy increases as the mass of the heavy quark increases .",
    "calculations based on the flavor - spin interaction @xcite or the instanton induced interactions @xcite also show that the mass of @xmath0 is below that of two charmed mesons . for a similar reason , the chance of having a stable heavy pentaquark ( @xmath5 ) increases as the mass of heavy anti - quark becomes larger .",
    "experimental observation of such explicitly exotic hadrons is crucial in refining our understanding of multiquark interactions in low energy qcd .",
    "however , producing the @xmath4 from an elementary process is highly suppressed as it involves creating two @xmath6 pairs from the vacuum .",
    "in contrast , in relativistic heavy ion collisions at lhc , @xmath7 pairs are expected to be abundantly produced @xcite . since the hadronization from the quark - gluon plasma produced in these collisions tends to follow a statistical description , production of exotic hadrons in heavy ion collisions at lhc is thus much more favorable than in elementary reactions @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we first give a qualitative argument why multiquark hadrons consisting of heavy quarks are likely to exist .",
    "using both the quark coalescence model and the statistical hadronization model , we then give estimates of how many @xmath4 and charmed pentaquark baryons , if they exist , will be produced in central heavy ion collisions at both rhic and lhc . furthermore",
    ", possible decay modes of these charmed exotic hadrons are discussed .",
    "sophisticated constituent quark model calculations have been performed to study possible stable multiquark hadrons that consist of heavy quarks .",
    "these results can be roughly understood in terms of simple arguments based on the color - spin interaction . to illustrate the mechanism , we introduce the following simplified form for the color - spin interaction @xcite : @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mass and spin of the constituent quarks @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the strength of the color - spin interaction @xmath13 should depend on the wave function and the exact form of the interaction as well as the color structure of either the quark - quark or quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the color factor would be @xmath14 for diquarks in the color antitriplet channel and @xmath15 for quark and anti - quark pair in the color singlet channel .",
    "this simple form with @xmath16 for a diquark and @xmath17 for a quark - antiquark pair can capture some of the essential physics in hadron masses .",
    "to illustrate this point , we assume the following constituent quark masses : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    ".baryon mass relations .",
    "the first column is fit to experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table11 ]",
    "lastly , we comment on the possibility to measure doubly charmed baryons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the doubly charmed baryon @xmath22 have been observed by the selex collaboration in the @xmath23 and in the @xmath24 decay modes with a mass of ( @xmath25 ) mev @xcite .",
    "the same collaboration has also successfully measured @xmath26 in the @xmath27 decay mode with a mass of 3460 mev @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", attempts by the focus collaboration in the photoproduction experiment , and by the babar in @xmath28 annihilation experiments @xcite have so far failed to establish the existence of the doubly charmed baryons .",
    "hence , it is an interesting problem to search for the doubly charmed baryons in heavy ion collisions . using the coalescence model , we find that the number of @xmath26 produced are @xmath29 at rhic , and @xmath30 at lhc .",
    "therefore , we will be able to realistically measure @xmath26 and @xmath22 through their decay vertices to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and to @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "based on the consideration of the color - spin interaction between diquarks , which describes reasonably the mass splittings between many hadrons and their spin flipped partners , we have shown that tetraquark mesons and pentaquark baryons that consist of two charmed quarks could be bound . using the quark coalescence model , their yields in heavy ion collisions at both rhic and lhc",
    "are estimated . because of the expected large charm quark number in central pb+pb collisions at lhc , the abundances of the tetraquark meson @xmath0 and pentaquark baryon @xmath1 are about @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we have also discussed their decay modes to illustrate how they can be identified in heavy ion collisions . in our studies , we have not taken into account the hadronic effect on the abundance of these charmed exotics , as hadronic reactions that affect their annihilation and production are unknown .",
    "since the yields of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the coalescence model is significantly smaller than those expected from the statistical hadronization model , including the hadronic effect is expected to increase their yields substantially and reduces the differences from the predictions from the quark coalescence model and the statistical hadronization model . also , charmed hadrons would be more abundantly produced , particularly the @xmath0 , if charm quarks are produced from the qgp formed in these collisions",
    ". we also comment on the possible measurement of doubly charmed baryons in heavy ion collisions , and the estimated numbers are @xmath29 and @xmath30 at rhic and lhc , respectively .",
    "we thus expect that the open and hidden charmed hadron physics will be an interesting subject in the forthcoming heavy ion collision experiments .",
