    "<S> the transverse charge densities in the nucleon indicate that the size of the nucleon tends to bulge out in nuclear matter . </S>",

    "<S> * it is of utmost importance to understand the structure of the nucleon in particle and nuclear physics , since the nucleon consists of the basic building block of matter . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon electromagnetic ( em ) form factors are the fundamental issue in that they reveal how the electric charge and magnetization of the quarks are distributed inside the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> while the em form factors have been studied well over several decades , their understanding is still not complete .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a series of new measurements of the em form factors has been carried out and has produced the remarkably precise data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these new experimental results have subsequently intrigued both experimental and theoretical works ( see , for example , the following reviews  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data with high precision enable one to make a flavor decomposition of the nucleon em form factors with isospin and charge symmetries taken into account  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) have unveiled a novel aspect of the nucleon em structure : the fourier transforms of the nucleon em form factors in the transverse plane , as viewed from a light front frame moving towards a nucleon , paint a tomographic picture of how the charge densities of quarks are distributed  @xcite transversely . </S>",
    "<S> these transverse charge densities of the quarks inside a nucleon have been already investigated for the unpolarized  @xcite and transversely polarized  @xcite nucleons .    </S>",
    "<S> it is of equal importance to examine how the em structure of the nucleon is changed in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> studying the em form factors of the nucleon in medium provides a new aspect on em properties of the nucleon modified in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the first experimental study of deeply virtual compton scattering on ( gaseous ) nuclear targets ( h , he , n , ne , kr , xe ) was reported in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while uncertainties of the first measurement are so large that one is not able to observe nuclear modifications of the nucleon structure , future experiments will bring about more information on medium modifications of the em properties of the nucleon .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we want to investigate the nucleon em form factors and the transverse charge densities of quarks inside a nucleon in nuclear matter within the framework of an in - medium modified skyrme model . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrme model has certain virtues : it is simple but respects chiral symmetry and its spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can easily extend it to the study of nuclear matter , based on modifications of the pion in medium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - momentum tensor form factors of the nucleon , which are yet another fundamental form factors that are related to the generalized em form factors , have been investigated in nuclear matter within this framework  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results have explained certain interesting features of the modifications of the nucleon in nuclear matter such as the pressure and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we will also show in this work how the em properties of the nucleon are changed in nuclear matter in a simple manner . </S>",
    "<S> we will also see that the transverse charge densities expose noticeably how the distribution of quarks undergo changes in the presence of nuclear medium .    </S>",

    "<S> this set of the parameters reproduce qualitatively well the experimental data for the nucleon and @xmath5-isobar in free space .    </S>",
    "<S> the medium functionals , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are expressed as @xmath9 they encode information on how the surrounding environment influences properties of the single skyrmion . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related to the corresponding phenomenological @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave pion - nucleus scattering lengths and volumes , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , which describe the pion physics in a nucleus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last functional @xmath8 is parameterized in the form of an exponential function and represents the medium modification of the skyrme parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this simple form with two variational parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 reproduce the correct position of the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> note that because of the modification of the skyrme term , all of the electromagnetic charge distributions except for the isoscalar electric charge depend explicitly on the medium density . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the medium functional @xmath7 appears in the expression of the isovector magnetic density distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the charges of the proton ( @xmath29 ) and neutron ( @xmath42 ) are defined as @xmath43 where density distributions include the prefactor @xmath44 . </S>",

    "<S> * we are now in a position to discuss the results . in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] , we list the results of the magnetic moments , the isoscalar and isovector charge radii of the nucleon as functions of @xmath47 . the electric charge radius of the nucleon is well reproduced in free space , compared with the experimental data : @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> .magnetic moments , meansquare radii of the nucleons in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic moments are given in units of nuclear magnetons ( n.m . ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of the proton charge radius shows that the size of the proton swells up in nuclear matter , which is consistent with those of different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at normal nuclear matter density the proton charge radius @xmath49 is enhanced by about @xmath50 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the neutron charge radius @xmath51 is reduced by about @xmath52 . at first glance , the size of the neutron seems reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , however , it swells like that of the proton , because the positive charges of the neutron are distributed in the inner part of , whereas the negative charges are found in outer part . </S>",
    "<S> when the neutron is in medium , both the positive and negative charges are broadened , which implies that size of the neutron actually becomes larger in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> this will be explicitly shown later when we discuss the transverse charge densities of the neutron .    </S>",
    "<S> as was known already , the results of the nucleon magnetic moments in the skyrme model turn out to be underestimated . </S>",
    "<S> however , since we are mainly interested in the modification of the nucleon magnetic moments in nuclear matter , we will concentrate on how the magnetization of the nucleon undergoes changes in medium . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moments are even more dramatically changed due to the additional medium factor @xmath7 in the expression of the magnetic - vector density distribution @xmath53 . as a result , the proton magnetic moment is enhanced by almost about @xmath54 at normal nuclear matter density @xmath55 , whereas the neutron one increases by about @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the neutron is changed more sensitively , which will be shown later again in the neutron transverse charge densities </S>",
    "<S> .    0.6 cm    0.5 cm    0.6 cm    figure  [ fig : pnemff ] draws the results of the proton and the neutron em form factors in free space ( dashed curve ) and at normal nuclear matter density @xmath55 in nuclear matter ( solid curve ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that as the density increases , the em form factors fall off in general faster than those in free space . </S>",
    "<S> similar qualitative results have been obtained in the framework of the quark meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the present results are quantitatively different from those in the qmc model . </S>",
    "<S> for example , compared with the proton electric form factor at @xmath57 in free space , @xmath58 is reduced by about @xmath56 at @xmath55 , whereas that from the qmc model decreases only by about @xmath59  @xcite . in the case of the neutron one @xmath60 , it is the other way around . at @xmath61  gev@xmath62 , </S>",
    "<S> the neutron electric form factor is changed by about @xmath63 only but in the qmc model brings it is lessened by about @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the neutron electric form factor falls off faster in nuclear matter than that in free space ( e.g. at @xmath64  gev@xmath62 @xmath65 is decreased by approximately @xmath66 ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the present results are similar to those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in general , the neutron is more likely to be changed in medium .    </S>",
    "<S> the modifications of the nucleon magnetic form factors are also more prominent within the present model in comparison with the qmc model . at normal nuclear matter @xmath67 and at @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> the proton and neutron magnetic form factors are reduced by about @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , compared to the case of the free space within our approach , while the qmc model yields them decreased by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in general , the present results show stronger medium effects than those from the qmc model .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also of great interest to study the flavor - decomposed em form factors , since the experimental data are now available in free space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we want to examine how the flavor - decomposed em form factors undergo the changes in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> assuming isospin symmetry in flavor su(2 ) , we can decompose the nucleon em form factors into those of the up and down quarks as follows  @xcite : @xmath72 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : udff ] , we draw the results of the up and down em form factors in free space ( dashed curve ) and at normal nuclear matter density ( solid curve ) . in general , the form factors in nuclear matter tend to fall off faster than those in free space . </S>",
    "<S> the down em form factors are shown to be more sensitively affected by the presence of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the in - medium down magnetic form factor starts to decrease less than that in free space till about @xmath73 , and then drops off sharply . </S>",
    "<S> we will soon see a similar feature when the transverse charge densities are considered .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.6 cm    0.5 cm    0.6 cm    the transverse charge densities of quarks inside a nucleon reveal the modification of the nucleon em structures more prominently . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the usual charge and magnetization densities obtained from the three - dimensional fourier transform of the em form factors in the breit framework obscure their physical meaning because of the lorentz contraction of the nucleon in its moving direction  @xcite . on the other hand , the transverse charge density provides a clear understanding of how the charge of quarks inside a nucleon are distributed . </S>",
    "<S> we can extend straightforwardly this to nuclear matter . however , we want to mention a caveat . </S>",
    "<S> since the original skyrme model produces the underestimated magnetic form factors of the nucleon but explains reasonable @xmath74 dependence , whereas it yields the overestimated electric one of the neutron . </S>",
    "<S> it causes a difficulty in describing the transverse charge density inside a neutron that depend on both the neutron electric and magnetic form factors . </S>",
    "<S> however , the present aim is at studying how the em properties of the nucleon undergo changes in nuclear matter , so that we will rather use the normalized nucleon magnetic form factors with the experimental data for the corresponding magnetic moments as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pnemff ] .    </S>",
    "<S> when the nucleon is unpolarized , the quark transverse charge density can be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a bessel function of order zero . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : npfixedx ] depicts the transverse charge densities inside an unpolarized proton in the upper panel and an unpolarized neutron in the lower panel . in the left and right panels , we show those in free space and in nuclear matter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the nucleons swell up indeed in nuclear medium . in the center of the proton </S>",
    "<S> , the positive charge distribution tends to lessens but it extends in outer directions in nuclear matter . in the case of the neutron , the medium effects </S>",
    "<S> are more noticeably observed as shown in the lower - right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nptcm ] .    0.6 cm    0.6 cm    note , however , that the negative charges are centered as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but are not as deep as that of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies in the fact that the neutron electric form factor turns out to be overestimated , as mentioned already .    0.6 cm    0.6 cm    assuming that the nucleon is polarized in the @xmath78 direction which can be expressed by the transverse spin operator of the nucleon @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the pauli form factor contributes to the transverse quark charge densities inside a transversely polarized nucleon as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the position vector from the center of the nucleon in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath82 are the bessel functions of order 0 and 1 . the second term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ trchden ] ) makes the transverse charge densities distorted from the unpolarized one . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the polarization direction of the nucleon along the @xmath83 axis , i.e. @xmath84 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : npfixedx ] , we draw the transverse charge densities inside polarized nucleons . the density inside the polarized nucleon is shown to be distorted in the negative @xmath85 direction . as explained already in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the polarization of the nucleon in the @xmath83 direction induces the electric dipole moment in the negative @xmath86 direction , which is just the relativistice effect . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the strong distortion arises as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : npfixedx ] . in nuclear matter , the transverse charge density shows the same tendency but seems less obvious . </S>",
    "<S> this might be due to the fact that the quark charges decrease in the center of the proton but extend to the outer region . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the influence of the proton polarization on the transverse charge densities is somewhat diminished .    </S>",
    "<S> when it comes to the neutron case , the polarization effects are profound : the negative charges are forced to move to the negative @xmath86 , while the positive charges are found in the positive @xmath86 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the transverse charge densities inside the polarized neutron turn out be very asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true in nuclear matter .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.6 cm    0.5 cm    0.6 cm    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : npfixedx ] , the profiles of the transverse charge densities are plotted with @xmath87 is fixed to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of nuclear medium are clearly observed . in general , the transverse charge densities in nuclear matter are likely to decrease in the center but extends to the outer directions .    </S>",
    "<S> * 5 . * the present work aimed at investigating how the electromagnetic properties of the nucleons were modified in nuclear matter within the framework of the in - medium modified skyrme model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon fell off faster in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse charge densities inside a proton and a neutron indicate that the nucleon in nuclear medium tends to swell up in general . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the proton polarization are somewhat reduced in nuclear matter . since the positive charges decrease in the center of the proton but extends to outer directions , the distortion of the transverse charge distribution is less noticeable . </S>",
    "<S> the same features were found in the neutron case .    </S>",
    "<S> the present results are consistent with those of other models : for example , a soliton model with vector mesons  @xcite and the qmc model calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present investigation may shed light on understanding the medium modification of the nucleon , which will be measured experimentally in near future . </S>"
