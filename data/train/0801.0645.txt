    "the dbq4 star lds749b ( wd2129 + 00 ) has long been considered for a flux standard ( e.g. , bohlin et  al .",
    "1990 ) . to establish the flux on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) white dwarf ( wd ) flux scale , stis spectrophotometry was obtained in 20012002 .",
    "the virtues of lds749b as a flux standard include an equatorial declination and a significantly cooler flux distribution than the 3300061000  k primary da standards gd71 , gd153 , and g191b2b .",
    "full stis wavelength coverage is provided from 0.1151.02  @xmath0 m , and the peak in the sed is near 1900   . at @xmath8 ( landolt & uomoto 2007 ) , lds749b is among the faintest _ hst _ standards and is suitable for use with larger ground - based telescopes and with the more sensitive _",
    "hst _ instrumentation , such as the acs / sbc and cos .",
    "the bulk of the stis data was obtained as part of the fastex ( faint astronomical sources extention ) program .",
    "finding charts appear in turnshek et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) and in landolt & uomoto ( 2007 ) ; but there is a large proper motion of 0.416 and 0.034 arcsec / yr in right ascension and declination , respectively .    the absolute flux calibration of _ hst _ instrumentation is based on models of three pure hydrogen wd stars gd71 ,",
    "gd153 , and g191b2b ( bohlin 2000 ; bohlin , dickenson , & calzetti 2001 ; bohlin 2003 ) . in particular , the nlte model fluxes produced by by the tlusty code ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ) determine the shape of the flux distributions using the known physics of the hydrogen atom and of stellar atmospheres .",
    "if there are no errors in the basic physics used to determine the stellar temperatures and gravities from the balmer line profiles , then the uncertainty of 3000  k for the effective temperature of g191b2b means that the relative flux should be correct to better than 2.5% from 0.13 to 1  @xmath0 m and to better than 1% from 0.35 to 1  @xmath0 m .    a model that matches the observations serves as a noise free surrogate for the observational flux distribution and provides a reliable extrapolation beyond the limits of the observations for use as a calibration standard for _ jwst _ , _ spitzer _ , and other ir instrumentation .",
    "currently , the best ir absolute flux distributions are found in a series of papers from the epic and pioneering work of m.  cohen and collaborators , i.e. , the cohen - walker - witteborn ( cww ) network of absolute flux standard ( e.g. , cohen , wheaton , & megeath 2003 ; cohen 2007 ) .",
    "the cww ir standard star fluxes are all ultimately based on models for vega and sirius ( cohen et  al .",
    "more recently , bohlin & gilliland ( 2004 ) observed vega and published fluxes on the _",
    "hst_/stis wd flux scale .",
    "a small revision in the stis calibration resulted in excellent agreement of the stis flux distribution with a custom made kurucz model with @xmath9  k ( bohlin 2007 ) , which is the same @xmath10 used for the cohen et  al.(1992 ) vega model .",
    "the model presented here for lds749b and archived in the calspec database should have a better precision than the kuruzc @xmath9  k model for vega , especially beyond @xmath112  @xmath0 m , where the vega s dust disk becomes important ( engleke , price , & kraemer 2006 ) .",
    "vega is also a pole - on rapid rotator , which may also cause ir deviations from the flux for a single temperature model . our modeled flux distribution for lds749b should have an accuracy comparable to the pure hydrogen model flux distributions for the primary wd standards gd71 , gd153 , and g191b2b .",
    "a helium model atmosphere flux distribution for lds749b is calculated with the lte code of koester ( e.g. , castanheira et  al .",
    "2006 ) for @xmath11  k and @xmath3 .",
    "at such a cool temperature , the differences between lte and nlte in the continuum flux distributions should be @xmath40.1% from the far - uv to the ir .",
    "for example for a pure hydrogen da , the difference between the continua of a hot 40,000  k lte / nlte pair of models is 1% between 0.12.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the same maximum difference at 20,000  k is only 0.3% .",
    "napiwotzki ( 1997 ) did not discuss pure he models but concludes that nlte effects tend to become smaller with lower effective temperature .",
    "for cool da wds , koester et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that the only nlte effect that approaches 1% is a deeper line core of h@xmath12 . the matter densities in helium - rich white dwarfs are significantly higher , leading to a higher ratio of collisional versus radiative transitions between atomic levels",
    ". the larger importance of collisions increases the tendency towards lte occupation numbers because of the robust maxwell distribution of particle velocities .",
    "the @xmath11  k is higher than the @xmath13  k published for lds749b ( alias g26@xmath1410 ) in castanheira et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , because only uv spectra of lower precision ( _ iue _ heritage ) were used in that analysis .",
    "voss et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) found @xmath15  k with large uncertainty , because only line profiles in the optical range were used and @xmath16 had to be assumed . a trace of carbon at @xmath17 of the solar c",
    "/ he ratio is included , i.e. the c / he number ratio is 3.715@xmath18 .",
    "the model mass is 0.614  @xmath19 and the stellar radius is 0.01224  @xmath20 , which corresponds to a distance of 41  pc for the measured stis flux .",
    "the line broadening theory for the he lines combines van der waals , stark , and doppler broadening to make a voigt profile .",
    "however , the stark broadening uses a simple lorentz profile with width and shift determined from the broadening data in griem ( 1964 ) , instead of the elaborate calculations of beauchamp et  al.(1997 ) .",
    "the griem method is computationally much faster , and data are available for more lines than are calculated by beauchamp et  al .",
    "the fit of the higher series he lines is much improved , if the neutral - neutral interaction is decreased in comparison to the original formalism of the hummer - mihalas occupation probabilities .",
    "a similar effect was noticed by koester et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and our model uses the same value of the quenching parameter that koester et  al .  derived ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the model wavelengths are all on a vacuum scale .",
    "the sensitivities of the five stis low dispersion spectrophotometric modes have been carefully tracked since the stis commissioning in 1997 .",
    "after correcting for changing sensitivity with time ( stys , bohlin , & goudfrooij 2004 ) and for charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses for the three stis ccd spectral modes ( bohlin & goudfrooij 2003 ; goudfrooij et  al .",
    "2006 ) , stis internal repeatability is often better than 0.5% ( bohlin 2003 ) .",
    "thus , _ hst_/stis observations of lds749b provide absolute spectrophotometry with a precision that is superior to ground based flux measurements , which require problematic corrections for atmospheric extinction .",
    "observations with a resolution @xmath221500 in four stis modes from 11501710    ( g140l ) , 15903170    ( g230l ) , 29005690    ( g430l ) , and 530010200    ( g750l ) were obtained in 20012002 .",
    "earlier observations of lds749b in 1997 to test the time - tagged mode were unsuccessful .",
    "two observations in the ccd g230 lb mode overlap the wavelength coverage of the mama g230l but are too noisy to include in the final combined absolute flux measurement from the other four modes .",
    "table  1 summarizes the individual observations used for the final combined average , along with the unused g230 lb data for completeness .",
    "figure 1 shows the ratios of the three individual g230l and the two g230 lb observations to the model fluxes , which are normalized to the stis flux in the 53005600    range .",
    "the excellent repeatability of stis spectrophotometry over broad bands is illustrated and the global average ratio over the 17503000    band pass is written in each panel .",
    "this ratio is unity to within 0.3% , even for the shorter ccd g230 lb exposures despite their almost @xmath23 higher noise level and cte corrections .",
    "the other ccd modes g430l and g750l also require cte corrections .",
    "repeatability for all the stis spectral modes is comparable , i.e. , the global ratio deviates rarely from unity by more than 0.6% .",
    "the observations in each of the four spectral modes are averaged and the four segments are combined .",
    "this composite standard star spectrum extends from 115010226    and can be obtained at http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/calspec.html/ along with the remainder of the _ hst _ standard star library ( bohlin , dickenson , & calzetti 2001 ) .",
    "this binary fits table named @xmath24 has 3666 wavelength points and seven columns .",
    "an ascii file of the flux distribution in table  2 is available via the electronic version of this paper .",
    "table  2 contains the wavelength in   and the flux in erg @xmath25 s@xmath26 @xmath26 in the first two columns , while columns  34 are the poisson and systematic uncertainty estimates in flux units , respectively .",
    "column  5 is the fwhm of the resolution in  .",
    "the @xmath27 version has two more columns than the ascii version : column  6 is a data - quality flag , where one is good and zero may be poor quality . the seventh column is the exposure time in seconds .",
    "the fluxes at the shortest wavelengths below 1160    are unreliable because of the steepness of the sensitivity drop - off .",
    "to compare the model and observations , a convenient method of removing the slope of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is to divide both fluxes by the same theoretical model continuum .",
    "small differences between the observations and the model , either in the lines or in the actual continuum , are easily illustrated in such plots .",
    "the theoretical continuum contains only continuum opacities with an extrapolation across the he  i opacity edges at 2601 , 3122 , and 3422   , in order to avoid discontinuities .",
    "figure  2 shows an overview of the comparison of the stis fluxes with the model after division of both seds by this same smooth line - and - edge - free continuum .",
    "the mean continuum level of the data between the absorption lines agrees with the model within @xmath11% almost everywhere .",
    "the most significant deviation of the data from the model is in the broad 14001550    region , where each of the three spectra comprising the g140l average have 350,000 photo - electron events in this 150    band .",
    "the background level is @xmath40.1% of the net signal , so that neither counting statistics nor background subtraction error could cause the observed @xmath11.5% average disparity .",
    "of the five low dispersion modes , g140l shows the worst photometric repeatability of individual spectra in broad bands of @xmath280.6% .",
    "the three individual spectra comprising the g140l average do show occasional 23@xmath29 broadband dips within their 550    coverage region ; but the probability of such a large excursion as 1.5% in their average is extremely unlikely at any particular wavelength .",
    "however , the probability is much greater that such a large excursion could occur in some 150    band .",
    "individual g140l spectra of the monitoring standard grw+70@xmath305824 often show a broad region differing by 12% from the average",
    ". the cause of such excursions could be flat field errors , temporal instabilities in the flat field , or other detector effects that might make the flat field inapplicable to a narrow spectral trace .",
    "the uncertainty in the model @xmath10 is determined by the uncertainty in the slope of the uv flux distribution . for a constant @xmath31 model that is cooler or hotter by 50  k and normalized to the measured 53005600    flux ,",
    "there are increasing differences with the data from 1% near 2000    to 2% at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "such a large change in the modeled continuum level in figure  2 ( red line ) is inconsistent with the stis flux ( black line ) .",
    "this 50  k uncertainty of the model @xmath10 is an internal uncertainty relative to the temperatures of the primary wd standards gd71 , gd153 , and g191b2b .",
    "if a re - analysis of the balmer lines in these primary da standards produces a systematic shift in the temperature scale , this shift would be reflected in a revised @xmath10 for lds749b that is independent of the 50  k internal uncertainty .",
    "a 50  k temperature difference causes a @xmath40.5% flux change in the ir longward of 1  @xmath0 m .    to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath31 ,",
    "models are computed at the 13575  k baseline temperature but with an increment in @xmath31 .",
    "positive and negative increments produce nearly mirror image changes in the flux distribution . for a decrease of 0.7 in @xmath31 ,",
    "the flux decreases by a nearly uniform 1.5% below 3600    after normalizing to unity in the 53005600    range . increasing the @xmath10 by the full 50  k uncertainty to 13625",
    "k can compensate for this flux decrease below @xmath12000   .",
    "however , the + 50  k increase compensates little in the 25003600    range , leaving a disparity of @xmath11% . because this 25003600    range includes some of the best s / n stis data , a 1% disparity establishes the uncertainty of 0.7  dex in @xmath31 as barely compatible with the stis flux distribution . the ir uncertainty corresponding to this",
    "limiting case of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is @xmath11% longward of 1  @xmath0 m , because the fractional percent changes in the ir from the higher temperature and from the lower @xmath31 are both in the same direction .",
    "another source of error in the model @xmath10 is interstellar reddening .",
    "the standard galactic reddening curve has a strong broad feature around 2200   ; and a tiny limit to the extinction @xmath34 is set by the precise agreement of stis with the model in this region of figure  2 .",
    "for the upper temperature limit of @xmath35  k , an @xmath36 brings the reddened model into satisfactory agreement with stis .",
    "however , for a temperature increment of 100  k and @xmath37 , the model is @xmath11% high at 1300  and @xmath11% low at 2200   .",
    "thus , for standard galactic reddening , @xmath34 must be less than 0.004 , and @xmath10 is less than 13675  k. in this case of @xmath10 and @xmath34 at these allowed limits , the ir flux beyond 1  @xmath0 m is still the same as for the unreddened baseline @xmath11  k within 0.5% .    however , bohlin ( 2007 ) presented arguments for reddening with a weak 2200  bump for other lines of sight with tiny amounts of extinction . reddening curves measured in the smc ( e.g. , witt & gordon 2000 ) are missing the 2200  feature and can cause larger uncertainty in @xmath10",
    ". additional evidence for extinction curves more like those in the magellanic clouds is presented by clayton et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the local warm intercloud medium , where the reddening is low .",
    "changes in the shape of the flux distribution after reddening with the smc curve of witt and gordon are similar to the change in shape with @xmath10 .",
    "for example , reddening a model with @xmath38  k by smc extinction of 0.015 is required to make an equally unacceptable fit as for 13675  k and galactic extinction of @xmath39 . in this extreme limiting case of smc extinction ,",
    "the ir flux beyond 1  @xmath0 m is still the same within @xmath11% as for @xmath11  k and @xmath40 .    despite small uncertainties in the interstellar reddening and consequent uncertainty in @xmath10 ,",
    "our modeling technique still predicts the continuum ir fluxes to 1% from 1  @xmath0 m to 30  @xmath0 m . discounting the most pathological case of smc reddening ,",
    "the worst far - ir uncertainty is from the combined 50  k temperature and 0.7 @xmath31 uncertainties , because the changes in the slope from the visual band normalization region into the ir due to higher temperature and lower @xmath31 are both in the same direction . in the absence of modeling errors or other physical complications like",
    "ir excesses from dust rings , the measured fluxes of lds749b relative to the three primary wds should be the same as predicted by the relative fluxes of the respective models to a precision of 1% in the ir .        an upper limit on the equivalent width for h@xmath12 of @xmath10.1",
    "constrains the fraction by number of hydrogen in the atmosphere of lds749b to @xmath41@xmath5 of helium .",
    "however , a stricter limit of @xmath41@xmath6 is provided by the weak ly@xmath12 line .",
    "because interstellar absorption at ly@xmath12 could be significant , zero hydrogen is consistent with the observations and is adopted for the final best model for lds749b .",
    "after normalization in the @xmath41  band , the continuum of a model with @xmath42 hydrogen composition and the baseline @xmath11  k and @xmath3 agrees with the zero hydrogen baseline continuum to @xmath10.5% from ly@xmath12 to 30  @xmath0 m .",
    "figure 3 compares the observed hei lines with the baseline model after correcting the model wavelengths by the radial velocity of @xmath1481  km s@xmath26 ( greenstein & trimble 1967 ) .",
    "the model is smoothed with a triangular profile of fwhm corresponding to a resolution @xmath43 for the mama spectra shortward of 3065    and to @xmath22 for the ccd spectra longward of 3065   . in general",
    ", the model underestimates the line strengths , even for the quenching of the neutral - neutral interactions with @xmath21 .",
    "there is a suggestion of some systematic asymmetry with stronger absorption in the short wavelength side of the line profile .",
    "this asymmetry could be in the stis line spread function ( lsf ) ; or perhaps , a more exact treatment of the stark line broadening theory would reproduce the observed asymmetries .      with a c /",
    "he ratio of @xmath41@xmath5 solar , i.e. a c / he number ratio of 3.715@xmath18 , the modeled c  i and c  ii lines reproduce the observations within the observational noise , as shown in figure  4 . in particular , the agreement of the modeled c  i(1329)/c  ii(1335 ) line ratio with the observed ratio means that the carbon ionization ratio corresponds to the photospheric temperature of the star . with this small amount of carbon ,",
    "the spectral clasification of lds749b should more properly be dbq ( wesemael et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the oxygen triplet at 1302.17 , 1304.87 , and 1306.04    constrains the fraction of oxygen in the lds749b atmosphere .",
    "this triplet absorption feature extends over 4    or about seven stis pixels ; but no obvious absorption feature appears above the noise level .",
    "after binning the stis data by seven pixels , the rms noise in the 1300    region is 0.8% .",
    "the corresponding 3@xmath29 upper limit to the equivalent width is 0.10   , which implies an upper limit to the atmospheric oxygen fraction by number of 7@xmath7 of helium .",
    "in the absence of any interstellar reddening , a helium model with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and a trace of carbon at @xmath41@xmath5 of solar fits the measured stis flux distribution for lds749b .",
