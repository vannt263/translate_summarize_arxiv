    "the discovery at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a higgs boson  @xcite represents a triumph for the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "nowadays , the primary question that requires an answer is whether such a particle belongs to the minimal sm higgs sector or to some beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenario .    indeed , it is well - known that the sm suffers from the so - called `` hierarchy '' problem ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , pointing out that it could be a low energy effective theory valid only up to some cut - off energy @xmath0 .",
    "such energy scale is unknown and phenomenological indications about it are missing .",
    "surely though , there is the possibility that @xmath0 is lying around the tev / multi - tev scale ( so that bsm physics could be discovered at the cern machine in the coming years ) .    for this reason ,",
    "many bsm scenarios with new physics at the tev / multi - tev scale were proposed in the last decades . in this spirit",
    ", we embrace the possibility that the higgs particle may be a composite state arising from some strongly interacting dynamics at a high scale instead of being a fundamental state . in this description ,",
    "the higgs state arise as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) from a particular coset of a global symmetry breaking  @xcite and it offers an elegant solution for the long - standing hierarchy problem .",
    "even in the situation where new physics is outside the discovery range of the present colliders , a composite higgs state arising as a pngb has modified couplings with respect to the sm  @xcite , hence the measurement of these quantities represents a powerful way to test the possible non - fundamental nature of the newly discovered state . in this case , a tev / multi - tev electron - positron collider would represent the cleanest environment for studying possible deviations from the sm signals .",
    "for this reason , in this proceeding , we will resume a previous analysis  @xcite concerning the potential of the proposed @xmath1 colliders in testing a specific realisation of a composite higgs model , the so - called 4-dimensional composite higgs model ( 4dchm ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , by extending our approach to encompass two new benchmarks and focusing on one of the most interesting higgs production channel : higgs - strahlung ( hs ) from @xmath2 bosons . as in our earlier paper",
    ", we borrow energy and luminosity configurations from machines prototypes such as the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite and the triple large electron - positron ( tlep ) collider  @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the 4dchm into numerical tools in order to perform dedicated analyses up to event generation .",
    "our simulations have been mainly performed with the calchep package  @xcite in which the model had been previously implemented via the lanhep tool  @xcite , see  @xcite .",
    "since calchep allows by default the analysis of tree - level processes only , we have also added by hand the one - loop @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 vertices ( computed at the leading order without approximations ) .    for beamstrahlung , calchep implements the jadach , skrzypek and ward expressions of refs .",
    "regarding the initial state radiation ( isr ) , we adopted the parametrisation specified for the ilc project in  @xcite , that is : beam size @xmath6 nm , bunch length @xmath7 @xmath8 m , bunch population @xmath9 .",
    "we will be considering throughout three values for the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy , which are standard benchmark energies for future @xmath1 proto - types : @xmath10 gev , @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 tev .",
    "then , we focus on the phenomenology of a higgs boson obtained via the hs process . when combining production cross sections and decay branching ratios ( brs ) , our simulated data will always be related to the experimental accuracies presented in refs .",
    "following their notation , we indicate the production cross section with @xmath13 for hs . in keeping with the aforementioned references , we have will assume a luminosity of @xmath10/@xmath11/@xmath14 fb@xmath15 in correspondence to an energy of @xmath10/@xmath11/@xmath14 gev .    in the following subsections we will present several results concerning the studies of the aforementioned higgs production process ,",
    "organised as follows .",
    "firstly , we investigate the behaviour of our benchmarks with respect to the mere rescaling of the couplings due to the decoupling of new physics ( the so - called `` decoupling limit '' ) . by considering points that respect exclusion limits from direct and indirect observation of new physics ( see  @xcite for details on the selection criteria ) , again",
    "we will show that genuine 4dchm effects can not be relegated to a simple rescaling of the relevant higgs couplings , as , for example , the presence of @xmath16 propagator effects in the hs production can not generally be neglected .",
    "in essence , to generalise our findings , quantitative studies of higgs boson phenomenology in composite higgs models at future electron - positron colliders should take into account possible effects from realistic mass spectra , whereby extra particles are retained in the calculation of observables , rather than integrated out .      in order to disentangle rescaling effects ( due to both the non - linear realisation of the goldstone symmetry and the mixing between sm and extra particles ) from the ones due to the additional propagators , we have introduced the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters for inclusive hs production cross section as follows : @xmath19",
    "then , by numerical computation , we have proven that , if the new class of neutral gauge bosons are completely stripped off the calculations , @xmath18 tends to @xmath20 with a negligible deviation @xmath21 related to a slight shift in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 couplings of the sm - like @xmath2 to the initial leptons , due to the aforementioned mixing . since hs is one of the most useful process to extract information about deviations of the higgs couplings from the sm values , we are essentially making the generic statement that ,",
    "even when the cm energy of the collider is below the scale of bsm physics , @xmath24 in this case ( the compositeness scale ) , where the additional boson and fermion masses of the 4dchm naturally tend to cluster , the hs cross section is basically always affected by propagator effects .     and",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    this is well illustrated by fig .",
    "[ randn ] , where we quantify the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters for two new benchmarks ( @xmath30gev , @xmath31gev ) as a function of the total width of the dominant extra - vectorial contribution , i.e. , @xmath32 , for the three customary values of cm energy .",
    "the rescaling factors are @xmath33 for @xmath30gev and @xmath34 for @xmath31gev .",
    "the slopes present in the plots , the more noticeable the larger the cm energy , show that propagator effects are at work .",
    "in fact , the trend of @xmath17 ( or equivalently @xmath18 ) is almost constant but , from some threshold ( @xmath35 gev ) on , it decreases with @xmath32 , reflecting the nature of the interference contribution that is proportional to @xmath36 when the cm energy is smaller than the @xmath25 mass involved(@xmath37 ) tev for @xmath38(@xmath12 ) tev and @xmath29(@xmath37 ) . ] . beside this",
    ", the non - zero positive @xmath18 value definitely points to a constructive interference taking place especially for small values of @xmath32 .    as in the previously analysed benchmarks in  @xcite , the deviations from the sm limit span from @xmath39 when @xmath40 gev up to @xmath41 when @xmath42 tev .",
    "again , we have verified that the effect is completely due to the constructive interference term arising from the sm - like @xmath2 resonance and the @xmath43 contributions , with @xmath25 being dominant among the two extra vectors .",
    "@xmath17 values are always above the expected `` reduction '' from the decoupling limit : at @xmath42 tev and even at @xmath44gev for @xmath31gev the @xmath17 value is above @xmath12 , which is not compatible with a decoupled scenario .    in fig .",
    "[ randn ] , we show that the benchmark with higher values of @xmath45 is related to smaller deviations from the decoupling limit , as expected .",
    "these results point at the fact that a complete study of composite higgs models via the hs process should also take into account the possibility of non - decoupled extra resonances .",
    "the presence of extra - vectors in the tev / multi - tev range can thus affect the hs cross section due to interference effects . as a consequence , modifications to the various observables",
    "can also arise and manifest in the analysis of the higgs couplings .",
    "therefore , such an alteration would affect the extraction of both the higgs - vector - vector and vector - fermion - fermion tree - level couplings , as well as the loop - induced couplings @xmath5 , @xmath4 and/or @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , these effects can modify the signal strengths in a way that may be detectable with the experimental accuracies expected at future electron - positron colliders .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    in this respect , we present our results in terms of scatter plots for our proposed benchmarks : @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 and @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 .",
    "we show the results of these scans in fig .",
    "[ mu ] , where we notice that the deviations from the case in which the full particle spectrum is not taken into account , represented by the stars , could modify the signal strengths for various channels .    in the case of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "the signal strengths of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 channels , these deviations are fully disentangleable while in the other cases this is not always true , depending on where the scan points fall relative to the sm expectations and according to the corresponding experimental error bars for a particular signature .    altogether , though , it is clear the potential that future leptonic machines can offer in pinning down the possible composite nature of the higgs boson discovered at cern by measuring its `` effective '' couplings to essentially all sm matter and forces .",
    "in this proceeding , we extended our previous analysis ( see  @xcite ) to two new benchmarks , albeit limitedly to the hs channel .",
    "we found that , in such concrete realisations of the 4dchm , the impact of interference effects due to extra tev / multi - tev neutral vectors at future @xmath1 colliders is never negligible .",
    "we have shown that , as a consequence , also the higgs signal strengths are affected by such effects . in general , this requires a careful treatment of the methods adopted in the extraction of the sm couplings from the main higgs production channel , _",
    "i.e. _ , hs , as the real couplings are crucially altered with respect to those emerging in a fully decoupled scenario .",
