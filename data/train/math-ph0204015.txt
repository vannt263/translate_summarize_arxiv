    "some time ago , feinberg and one of us ( in a paper to be referred to as fz @xcite ) proposed the study of the equation @xmath0 where the real numbers @xmath1 are generated from some random distribution .",
    "two particularly simple models were studied : ( a ) the @xmath1 s are equal to @xmath2 with equal probability , and ( b ) @xmath3 with the angle @xmath4 uniformly distributed between @xmath5 and @xmath6    imposing the boundary condition @xmath7 on ( [ seq ] ) we can write the set of equations as the eigenvalue equation @xmath8 with @xmath9 the column eigenvector with components @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 the @xmath16 by @xmath17 non - hermitian random matrix @xmath18    while quantum mechanics is of course hermitian it is convenient to think of @xmath19 as a hamiltonian and ( [ seq ] ) as the non - hermitian schrdinger equation describing the propagation of a particle hopping on a 1-dimensional lattice .",
    "some applications of non - hermitian random hamiltonians include vortex line pinning in superconductors  @xcite and growth models in population biology @xcite .",
    "a genuine localization transition can occur for random non - hermitian schrdinger hamiltonians  @xcite in one dimension .",
    "as mentioned in fz , with the open chain boundary condition @xmath20 the more general equation @xmath21 can always be reduced to ( [ seq ] ) by an appropriate `` gauge '' transformation @xmath22 furthermore , applying the transformation @xmath23 to ( [ seq ] ) we see that if we change @xmath24 then the spectrum changes by @xmath25 thus , scaling the magnitude of the @xmath26 s merely stretches the spectrum , and flipping the sign of all the @xmath1 s corresponds to rotating the spectrum by @xmath27    it is also useful to formulate the problem in the transfer matrix formalism .",
    "write ( [ seq ] ) as @xmath28 where the transfer matrix @xmath29 is defined as the 2 by 2 matrix @xmath30 define @xmath31 then the boundary condition implies @xmath32 the solution of this polynomial equation in @xmath33 determines the spectrum .    since @xmath34 is non - hermitian the eigenvalues invade the complex plane . for model",
    "b , the spectrum has an obvious rotational symmetry and forms a disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which displays the support of the density of states ) .",
    "an expansion of the density of eigenvalues around @xmath35 to very high orders in @xmath33 has been given by derrida et al .",
    ". this analytic expansion however can not predict singularities in the density of states .",
    "in contrast , for model a the spectrum enjoys only a rectangular @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "the first @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 obtained by complex conjugating the eigenvalue equation @xmath39 the second @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath40 obtained by the bipartite transformation @xmath41 remarkably , fz found that the spectrum has an enormously complicated fractal - like form . in fig",
    "[ fig2a ] we plot the support of the density of eigenvalues in the complex plane for a @xmath42 matrix , for a specific realization of the disorder .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] we plot the support of the density of states in the complex plane for a @xmath43 matrix , averaged over 100 realizations of the disorder .    contrasting figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] and  [ fig2b ] with fig .  [ fig1 ] , one can see why it has been a challenge for mathematical physicists to understand the nature of the spectrum .",
    "in general , for random non - hermitian matrices @xmath34 , the density of eigenvalues can be obtained by @xmath44 where the green s function is defined by @xmath45 with the bracket denoting averaging and @xmath46 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for a proof of these relations ) .",
    "equation  ( [ rho ] ) follows from the identity @xmath47 where @xmath46 .",
    "expanding @xmath48 we see that @xmath49 counts the number of paths of a particle returning to the origin in @xmath50 steps .",
    "evidently , for model a each link has to be traversed 4 times . the spectrum of model a was studied by cicuta et al .",
    "@xcite and by gross and one of us @xcite by counting paths .",
    "in particular , cicuta et al",
    ". gave an explicit expression for the number of paths .",
    "recently , the more general problem of even - visiting random walks has been studied extensively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", exact analytic results for the lyapunov exponent have been found by sire and krapivsky  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different approach based on the theory of words .",
    "we will focus on model a although some of our results apply to the general class of models described by ( [ schrody ] ) .",
    "one important issue is the dimensionality of the spectrum of model a. in general , the spectrum of non - hermitian random matrices when averaged over the randomness is 2-dimensional ( for example , the spectrum of model b ) .",
    "many of the authors who have looked at model a believe that its spectrum , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] and  [ fig2b ] , is quasi-0-dimensional : the spectrum seems to consist of many accumulation points .",
    "here we claim that the dimension of the spectrum actually lies between @xmath51 and @xmath52 dimensions , in the sense described below .",
    "consider the degree @xmath16 characteristic polynomial @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the @xmath55 identity matrix .",
    "we easily obtain the recursion relation @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 note that this second order recursion relation can be expressed in terms of transfer matrices as    @xmath59    very similar to those defined for the wave function @xmath9 , with the transfer matrix given by    @xmath60    following dyson and schmidt  @xcite we consider the characteristic ratio @xmath61 which satisfies the recursion relation @xmath62 with initial condition @xmath63 .",
    "the hope is that , while the characteristic polynomials @xmath64 obviously changes dramatically as @xmath50 varies , the characteristic ratio @xmath65 might converge asymptotically .    from the definition in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) , it is clear that a point @xmath66 is in the spectrum of the @xmath67 matrix iff @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus a point @xmath66 belongs to the spectrum if the corresponding set of variables @xmath70 is unbounded , that is , if the probability of escape of the variable @xmath71 to @xmath72 is finite .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , this condition is sufficient to determine the spectrum along the real axis ( @xmath73 ) , but is insufficient in the complex case .",
    "let @xmath74 be the probability distribution of @xmath75 ( note that @xmath75 is complex ) .",
    "then @xmath76 where the brackets denote the average over the disorder variables @xmath77 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath78 , under fairly general conditions @xcite",
    "it can be shown that the probability distribution has a limit @xmath79 , called the invariant distribution , which is determined by the self - consistent equation @xmath80 where we have used the fact that @xmath81 near a zero , @xmath82 , of @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 .    for model",
    "a , we obtain the amusing equation @xmath85    this type of equation has been studied extensively for the real case in @xcite . it can be shown that it can be solved by the ansatz @xmath86 where the @xmath87 s depend on @xmath66 whereas the @xmath88 s do nt .",
    "note that the index @xmath89 is not necessarily an integer and can refer to a continuous set .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that the @xmath90 are the stable fixed points of the product of any sequence of transfer matrices @xmath91 ( see the next section ) .    plugging ( [ ansatz ] ) into ( [ ds ] ) we have @xmath92 since the right hand side has twice as many delta function spikes as the left hand side , for the two sides to match we expect that , in general , the index @xmath89 would have to run over an infinite set .",
    "for a given complex number @xmath66 , we demand that the two sets of complex numbers @xmath93 and @xmath94 be the same .",
    "this very stringent condition should then determine the @xmath95    to see how this works , focus on a specific @xmath96 ( since the label @xmath89 has not been specified this can represent any @xmath87 ) .",
    "it is equal to either @xmath97 or @xmath98 for some @xmath99 but @xmath100 must in its turn be equal to either @xmath101 or @xmath102 for some @xmath103",
    ". this process of identification must continue until we return to @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , if the process of return to @xmath96 occurs in a finite number @xmath104 of steps , then it will repeat indefinitely ( since the system is back at its starting point @xmath105 .",
    "it is this infinite repetition which gives a finite weight to the @xmath106function at @xmath96 .",
    "by contrast , if the number of steps needed to return to the initial point @xmath96 is infinite , then the weight associated with this point vanishes , and it will not be present in the spectrum . we thus conclude that the support of the distribution of @xmath79 is the closure of the set of all the stable fixed points of the product of any sequence of transfer matrices @xmath91 . we also conclude that the support of the density of states of the non - hermitian matrix , in the thermodynamic limit , is given by the zeroes of any stable fixed point : @xmath107 .",
    "what is important to notice is that the @xmath88 are independent of @xmath66 and depend only on the length of the word .",
    "thus , we conclude that the set of complex numbers @xmath108 is determined by the solution of an infinite number of fixed point equations .",
    "it is useful here to introduce the theory of words .",
    "a word @xmath109 of length @xmath104 is defined as the sequence @xmath110 where the letters @xmath111 . in other words",
    ", we have a binary alphabet .",
    "let us also define the repetition of a given word a specific number of times as a simple sentence .",
    "we can then string together simple sentences to form paragraphs .",
    "for a given word @xmath109 of length @xmath104 , consider a function @xmath112 to be constructed iteratively .",
    "for notational simplicity we will suppress the dependence of @xmath113 on @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 indicating only its dependence on the length @xmath104 of the word @xmath117 the iteration begins with @xmath118 and continues with @xmath119 we define @xmath120    the set of complex numbers @xmath108 are then determined as follows .",
    "consider the set of all possible words .",
    "for each word @xmath109 , determine the solution of the fixed point equation @xmath121 by considering small deviations from the solution , we see that the solution is a stable fixed point only if @xmath122 the set of all possible words @xmath109 generates the set of complex numbers @xmath95 in other words , @xmath123 is determined by a continued fraction equation , since @xmath124 we see that @xmath125 has the form @xmath126 with the polynomials @xmath127 and @xmath128 determined by the recursion relations @xmath129 and @xmath130 with the initial condition @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 we notice that @xmath127 and @xmath128 satisfy the same recursion relation as that satisfied by @xmath135 with the correspondence @xmath136 note also that ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) can be packaged as the matrix equation @xmath137 where the transfer matrix @xmath138 defined in the previous section appears .",
    "this is closely related to the transfer matrix formalism discussed earlier .",
    "indeed , defining @xmath139 we have the initial condition @xmath140 .",
    "hence a given word @xmath109 of length @xmath104 can also be characterized by a matrix @xmath141 where for convenience we have written @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 , and @xmath145    for a given word @xmath116 the fixed point value @xmath123 is determined by the quadratic equation @xmath146 which is the fixed point equation of the homographic mapping associated with the matrix @xmath147 .",
    "the geometric interpretation is clear : the matrix @xmath148 acts on @xmath149component vectors @xmath150 , and we ask for the set of @xmath150 such that the ratio @xmath123 of the first component to the second component is left invariant by the transformation . in other words ,",
    "we look for the projective space left invariant by the transformation @xmath148 : the fixed point value @xmath123 defines the direction of the invariant ray .",
    "hence @xmath123 is given by @xmath151 with @xmath152 polynomials of degree @xmath153 in @xmath66 , where @xmath104 denotes the length of the word @xmath109 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath154 @xmath155 and @xmath156    the stability condition ( [ stable ] ) determines which root of ( [ b ] ) is to be chosen .",
    "we will see shortly that @xmath157 determines the spectrum . anticipating this , we see that if we form a compound word by stringing the word @xmath109 together twice ( for example , the japanese word `` nurunuru '' ) then we expect the contribution to the spectrum to be the same . but given the preceding discussion , this is obvious , since if a ray is left invariant by @xmath158 it is manifestly left invariant by @xmath159",
    "once we have determined @xmath160 , how do we extract the density of eigenvalues ?",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath161 of the matrix @xmath34 are given by @xmath162 . from ( [ y ] )",
    "we have @xmath163 , and thus @xmath164 using the identity ( [ cauchy ] ) we can differentiate the right hand side of ( [ bob ] ) to obtain the density of eigenvalues in the complex plane @xmath165 plugging in our solution @xmath166 we finally deduce that @xmath167    since the @xmath88 do not depend on @xmath66 , the spectrum is determined by the zeroes of the fixed point solutions @xmath168    we see from ( [ b ] ) that the density of eigenvalues is given as a sum over @xmath89 of terms like @xmath169-\\frac{r^{\\prime } ( z)}{% r(z)}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] thus the spectrum consists of isolated poles given by the zeroes of @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and of the cuts of @xmath172 , and is made of isolated points plus curved line segments connecting the zeroes of @xmath173    contrary to what some authors have believed , the spectrum is not @xmath174dimensional , but @xmath175dimensional , with @xmath176 .",
    "each word gives rise to a line segment , and words which differ slightly from each other gives rise to line segments near each other .",
    "indeed , given a word @xmath109 , it is possible to construct a word @xmath177 with a spectrum as close to that of @xmath109 as desired .",
    "for that purpose , we may construct @xmath177 as @xmath178 where @xmath150 is any `` corrupting '' word , and the two lengths @xmath179 and @xmath180 are sufficiently long .",
    "indeed , in terms of transfer matrices and invariant rays , we see that @xmath181 acting on any initial ray brings it close to the stable invariant ray of @xmath109 .",
    "then the direction of this ray is corrupted by @xmath150 , but it is brought back arbitrarily close to the invariant ray of @xmath109 by applying the transfer matrix @xmath182 , provided that @xmath179 is large enough . presumably ( although this remains to be proven rigorously ) , the spectrum associated with the corrupted word @xmath177 can be made as close as we want to that of @xmath109 .",
    "we have thus this property that for any word @xmath109 , there is a word @xmath177 generating a spectrum as close as we want to that of @xmath109 . in figs .  [ fig3a ] and  [ fig3b ] we plot the eigenstates of a word @xmath183 and the spectrum of the word @xmath184 .",
    "we see that the two spectra are very close .    as is clear from this discussion , the spectrum is indeed `` incredibly complicated . ''",
    "we content ourselves by focusing on the cuts of @xmath185 since for a word @xmath109 of length @xmath186 @xmath187 is a polynomial of degree @xmath153 with @xmath153 roots , it gives rise to @xmath104 curved line segments .",
    "the curves are given by the condition @xmath188 ( the sign of @xmath189 depends on the choice for the square root branch cut . )",
    "given a word @xmath109 of length @xmath104 , the corresponding spectrum must be invariant under a cyclic permutation of the letters @xmath190 namely under @xmath191 @xmath192    as an example , for the @xmath193letter word @xmath194 @xmath195 and @xmath196 , which has roots at @xmath197 @xmath198 , and @xmath199 .",
    "it is now clear what the words correspond to `` physically '' : a matrix @xmath34 with @xmath200 s given by an endless repetition of @xmath201 has a spectrum given by a straight line connecting @xmath197 and two algebraic curves connecting @xmath202 to @xmath203 and @xmath204 to @xmath205 , plus poles at @xmath206 notice that the two poles are buried under a cut . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the spectrum associated with the word @xmath207 together with the spectrum of a random @xmath43 matrix .",
    "we now give a complete study of all @xmath208letter words .",
    "the polynomial is easily found to be @xmath209 with @xmath210 @xmath211 , and @xmath212 the condition ( [ imq ] ) for the curves in the spectrum reduces to @xmath213 there are only three non - trivial @xmath208letter words , namely @xmath214 @xmath215 and @xmath216 their contribution to the spectrum of @xmath34 together with the spectrum of a random @xmath217 matrix is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] we show the contribution of all one , two , three , and four letter words to the density of states .",
    "thus , an @xmath218 by @xmath218 matrix @xmath34 with @xmath200 s given by repeating the word @xmath109 has a spectrum determined by the stable fixed point value @xmath157 corresponding to @xmath117 furthermore , consider an @xmath218  by @xmath218 matrix @xmath34 with @xmath219 s given by first repeating the word @xmath220 ( of length @xmath221 @xmath222 times and then by repeating the word @xmath223 ( of length @xmath224 @xmath225 times .",
    "as we would expect , in the limit in which @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 all tend to infinity , the spectrum of @xmath34 is given by superposing the spectra of @xmath229 @xmath230 , where @xmath229 is constructed with @xmath200 s given by first repeating the word @xmath231 @xmath232 times .",
    "this clearly generalizes . in figs .",
    "[ fig6a][fig6c ] we show the spectrum of the word @xmath233 , the spectrum of @xmath234 , and the spectrum of the word @xmath235 .",
    "we see the superposition principle at work .    from this discussion",
    "it becomes clear why the spectrum of the matrix @xmath34 in fz is so complicated .",
    "the sequence @xmath236 is a book written in the binary alphabet that , in the mathematical limit @xmath237 , contains all possible words , sentences , and paragraphs .",
    "in fact , @xmath34 contains everything ever written or that will be written in the history of the universe , including this particular paper .",
    "this familiar mind boggling fact accounts for the complicated looking spectrum first observed in fz .",
    "it also explains why numerical studies of the spectrum suggest that it is @xmath238dimensional . even for @xmath218 as large as @xmath239 the sequence contains an infinitesimally small subset of the set of all possible words , sentences , and paragraphs .",
    "in the ensemble of all books there are particularly simple books such that @xmath240 consists of a word @xmath109 of length @xmath104 repeated again and again . in this case , we can determine the spectrum explicitly by two different methods .",
    "let @xmath148 be the transfer matrix corresponding to @xmath117 in other words , @xmath241 where the matrix product is ordered .",
    "after repeating the word @xmath170 times , we have @xmath242 diagonalizing @xmath243 we see immediately that @xmath244 is a linear function of @xmath245 and @xmath246@xmath247 we remind the reader that all quantities in ( [ drl ] ) are functions of @xmath248    the spectrum of @xmath34 is determined by the zeroes of @xmath249 as @xmath250 we note that in this limit the solution of @xmath251 does not depend on knowing the detailed form of @xmath252 and @xmath253 indeed , ( [ zero ] ) implies @xmath254 or @xmath255 since @xmath256 in the limit @xmath257 @xmath258 tends towards a ( @xmath259dependent ) complex number of modulus unity . thus , we conclude that @xmath260 namely , that the eigenvalues of @xmath148 lie on the unit circle .",
    "this constraint suffices to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath261 plugging ( [ unit ] ) , that is @xmath262 into the eigenvalue equation @xmath263 we obtain @xmath264 if @xmath265 and @xmath266 if @xmath267 , which we can combine into the single equation @xmath268 after a trivial phase shift .    as @xmath269 ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath270 this traces out the spectrum in the complex plane .",
    "as an example , consider the @xmath208letter word @xmath271 , in which case ( [ result ] ) reduces to @xmath272 this traces out the algebraic curve shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] , which is to be compared to fig .  [ fig6b ] .",
    "of course , since @xmath34 is now translation invariant with period @xmath104 , we can apply bloch s theorem to determine the spectrum of @xmath261 imposing @xmath273 we reduce the eigenvalue problem of @xmath34 to the eigenvalue problem of the @xmath104 by @xmath104 matrix @xmath274 one can verify that with a suitable relation between @xmath269 and @xmath275 the eigenvalue equation @xmath276 becomes identical to ( [ result ] ) .",
    "we have seen that the structure of this simple tridiagonal non - hermitian random matrix possesses an amazing richness .",
    "this complexity can be understood if one realizes that the spectrum of the random matrix is the sum of the spectra of all tridiagonal matrices with a periodic subdiagonal obtained by repeating an infinite number of times any finite word of length @xmath104 , weighted by a factor @xmath277 .",
    "the number of lines does not have the cardinal of the continuum .",
    "the number of lines is equal to the number of words of any length that can be made with a 2-letter alphabet ; this is a countable number .",
    "there are many open questions concerning the fine structure of the spectrum , such as whether the spectrum contains holes in the complex plane ( in its domain of definition ) .",
    "we also have not touched upon the question of the nature of the eigenstates .",
    "are they localized or delocalized ?",
    "numerical data seems to suggest a localization transition .",
    "we hope to address these and other questions in future work .",
    "one of us ( ho ) would like to thank m. bauer , d. bernard and j.m .",
    "luck for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by the nsf under grant phy99 - 07949 to the itp .",
    "as remarked in the text , the coefficients of @xmath278 an even polynomial of degree @xmath279 must be constructed out of the cyclic invariants made of @xmath280 there is presumably a well - developed mathematical theory of cyclic invariants , but what we need we can easily deduce here .",
