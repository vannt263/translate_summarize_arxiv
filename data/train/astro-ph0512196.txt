    "within a year of its launch on 20 november , 2004 , swift accomplished most of its goals ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) : it saw and localized short - duration grbs and discovered their x - ray afterglow ( e.g.  gehrels et al .",
    "2005 ; covino et al .  2005 ; retter et al .",
    "2005 ) , heralding the discovery of their host galaxies in ground - based follow - up observations ( e.g.  bloom et al .  2005a , 2005b ; hjorth et al .  2005 ;",
    "antonelli et al .",
    "swift has detected grbs at large redshifts ( jakobsson et al .",
    "2005 ) , with a record @xmath0 ( haislip et al .  2005 ; cusumano et al .  2005 ; tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005a ) . its x - ray telescope ( xrt ) measured well the x - ray afterglows ( ags ) of long - duration grbs in the first hours after burst ( e.g.  chincarini  2005 ) .",
    "the latter observations have been claimed to provide two _ major surprises : _",
    "\\(a ) the 0.210 kev light curves of the x - ray ags exhibit a  canonical behaviour \" , to wit : ( i ) an initial very steep decay ( @xmath1 with @xmath2 ) , followed by ( ii ) a shallow decay ( @xmath3 ) , which finally evolves into ( iii ) a steeper decay ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these power - law segments are separated by the corresponding `` ankle '' and `` break '' at times 300 s @xmath5 500 s and @xmath6 s @xmath7 s ( chincarini et al .  2005 ; nousek et al .",

    "\\(b ) while most of the early ag light curves decline smoothly , a substantial fraction has large x - ray flares on short time scales ( see , e.g.  burrows et al .  2005a , 2005b ; nousek et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "it has also been claimed ( e.g.  chincarini et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al .  2005 ; zhang  2005 ) that the `` canonical behaviour '' and the flares can not easily be explained by current models",
    ". this may be true of the popular fireball ( fb ) models ( for a general review , see e.g.  zhang & mszros  2004 ) .",
    "it is not true of the  cannonball \" ( cb ) model ( dar & de rjula 2000 , 2004 and references therein ) . in the cb model the observed canonical behaviour and",
    "the flares are _ predictions _",
    "( dado , dar & de rjula  2002 , hereafter ddd2002 ) .",
    "this is discussed in this letter for two recent representative swift - xrt observations : grb 050315 ( vaughan et al .",
    "2005 ) and grb 050319 ( cusumano et al .",
    "in the cb model _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of cbs ejected in _",
    "ordinary core - collapse _ supernova explosions . an accretion disk or torus",
    "is hypothesized to be produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( de rjula  1987 ) . as observed in microquasars ( e.g.  rodriguez & mirabel  1999 ) , each time part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , a pair of cbs made of _ ordinary matter _ are emitted with large bulk - motion lorentz factors @xmath8 , in the polar directions wherefrom matter has already fallen back owing to the lack of rotational support .",
    "the @xmath8-rays of a single pulse in a grb are produced as a cb coasts through the sn ",
    "glory \" the sn light scattered by the sn and pre - sn ejecta .",
    "the electrons enclosed in the cb compton up - scatter to grb energies the photons of the glory ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) . as the cbs escape the sn environment , the ambient - light distribution becomes increasingly thin and radial .",
    "no longer can the glory s photons be efficiently up - scattered .",
    "the @xmath8-ray emission is taken over by thermal bremsstrahlung ( tb ) and line emission ( le ) from the rapidly expanding cbs .",
    "their rapid expansion stops ( ddd2002 ) within a few minutes of the ejection ( of near - axis observer s time ) by their interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the fast - declining tb and le is subsequently taken over by synchrotron radiation from swept - in ism electrons spiraling in the cbs enclosed magnetic field ( ddd2002 ) . the cb radiation is a sum of these mechanisms which produce a continuous x - ray ag light curve as the dominant cb radiation mechanism evolves according to : * inverse compton scattering @xmath9 bremsstrahlung + line emission @xmath9 synchrotron radiation . *    in the cb model , the typical parameters of cbs are not predicted but can be extracted from the analysis of optical and radio ags ( ddd2002 , dado , dar & de rjula  2003a ) .",
    "their values can then be used to predict the properties of the @xmath8-rays of grbs ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",
    "they also agree with the characteristic  canonical \" timing and flux of the above sequence , and the corresponding power - law and spectral changes ( ddd2002 ) .",
    "the surprise ( a ) of the introduction was already visible in the x - ray data of grbs 970508 , 970828 , 990510 and 010222 , and compatible with less - precise data on six other grbs , including 980425 .",
    "as for surprise ( b ) , late - time bumps and flares have been detected before in the x - ray ag of grb 970508 , in the radio ag of grb 030329 and in the optical ag of e.g.  grbs 000301c and 030329 .",
    "their cb - model interpretation is straightforward ( ddd2002 , dado et al .",
    "during the cb expansion phase , the emission from a cb is dominated by tb and le . in the rest frame of a cb ,",
    "interactions of the ism particles and photons with the cb s constituency produce a quasi - thermal electron population with a power - law tail ( @xmath10 ) of fermi - accelerated ( @xmath11 ) and  bethe - block \" ( @xmath12 ) knocked - on cb electrons ( dar & de rjula  2001 ) .",
    "thus , a cb emits a tb spectrum with a power - law tail , doppler - boosted by the cb s motion . the spectral shape ( dar & de rjula  2004 ) is : @xmath13 where",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the cb s plasma temperature and @xmath19\\approx 2\\ , \\gamma/(1+\\gamma^2\\ , \\theta^2)$ ] the doppler factor of a cb with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath20 , observed from an angle @xmath21 relative to its motion .",
    "the indexes @xmath22 and @xmath23 may deviate from the central predictions , as the radiation becomes dominated by le .",
    "also the power - law index of the radiating electrons ( after cooling ) may be larger than @xmath24 ( dar & de rjula  2004 ) .",
    "the observed energy flux from a cb at a luminosity distance @xmath25 is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cb s baryon number , @xmath28 its radius and @xmath29 its `` cooling function '' . if the loss - rate of the cb s internal energy is mainly adiabatic , @xmath30 . at a cb s transparency time ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32@xmath33 k ( ddd2002 ) , and @xmath29 oscillates and depends on composition in this @xmath18-range .",
    "a rough description of the results of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) is : @xmath34 , with @xmath35 for zero metallicity , and @xmath36 for high metallicity . during the short tb+le phase",
    ", @xmath37 stays put and @xmath28 increases approximately linearly with time .",
    "the observer time @xmath38 is related to the cb s rest - frame time @xmath39 through @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 and the expected powers are @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( obrein et al .",
    "2006 report @xmath44 cases , but they were not  caught \" early enough ) . here",
    "we adopt an intermediate metallicity , @xmath45 , for which @xmath46 .",
    "the cb - model predictions for the identity of the le - phase lines and the time - evolution of their energy are quite remarkable ( dado , dar & de rjula 2003b ) and perhaps worth testing .",
    "a cb is assumed to contain a tangled magnetic field in equipartition with the ism protons that enter it . as it ploughs through the ionized ism , it gathers and scatters its constituent protons .",
    "the re - emitted protons exert an inward pressure on the cb , countering its expansion . in the approximation of isotropic and complete re - emission in the cb s rest frame and a constant ism density @xmath47",
    ", one finds that within minutes of observer s time @xmath38 , a cb reaches an asymptotic radius @xmath48 , with @xmath49 its initial @xmath8 .",

    ". the sum of tb and synchrotron emissions produces the canonical x - ray light curve with an early fast tb decay , overtaken at the `` ankle '' by an initially much flatter synchrotron emission , which becomes steeper around the `` break '' , as demonstrated in figs .",

    "a fraction of early x - ray ags have flares on short time scales ( see , e.g.  burrows et al .  2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "in the cb model , such early time x - ray flares may be part of a long grb due to late time accretion episodes of the fall - back material on the compact central object , and/or if a significant precession of the jet axis occurs prior to these episodes , an x - ray flare may be a grb pulse viewed more off - axis , with the corresponding time - dilation and energy - softening .",
    "another possible source of flares is density jumps along the cb trajectory ( e.g.  ddd2002 ; dado et al .",
    "2004b ) . in the cb model ,",
    "the ag is a direct and _ quasi - local _ tracer of the density of the ism through which a cb travels ; see eq .",
    "( [ sync ] ) .",
    "such density jumps are produced in the circumburst environment by the sn and pre - sn ejecta , by the  winds \" inside the superbubbles ( sbs ) where most core - collapse sne take place and , in particular , at the complex sb boundaries created by stellar winds and previous sne within the sb .",

    "[ figs3 + 4]b .",
    "fitting bumps to density profiles is not over - informative , unless they are seen at various frequencies , as the cb model predicts the energy - dependence of the bump widths ( dado et al .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath29 in the relevant @xmath18-range may also induce x - ray flares .",
    "the early - time x - ray afterglows of grbs measured with swift - xrt provide an excellent test for two contenders : the fb and cb models .",
    "we have shown that the cb model passes this test with flying colours : the observed  canonical \" behaviour was correctly predicted ( ddd2002 ) long before the launch of swift . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no satisfactory fb model explanation of this behaviour has been found , though certain correlations have been proposed .",

    "( 2006 ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig3new ] ) . while the prediction of the cb model agrees with the data , the prediction of the fb model is in clear contradiction with the observations .",
    "a celebrated prediction of  conical fireball \" models is a break in the ags when the beaming angle of radiation from a decelerating cone increases beyond the opening angle of the jet , @xmath79 , and the observer begins to see the full cone ( e.g.  rhoads  1999 ; sari et al .",

    "in fact , in many grbs the ag is not achromatic as expected in the jetted fb model , and the break in the x - ray ag is not matched by a similar break in the optical ag ( e.g. panaitescu et al .",
    "this further questions the fb - model interpretation of the ag break ( rhoads  1997 , 1999 ; sari , piran and halpern  1999 ) and the proclaimed success of the `` frail relation '' .",
    "these suggest that the success of the frail relation is an artefact resulting from an a - posteriori adjustment of free parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath93 for all xrfs with known @xmath86 is much smaller than the  standard - candle \" value of frail et al .",
    "2001 , implying that xrfs and grbs can not be the same phenomenon viewed from different angles , contrary to indications ( e.g.  dado et al .",
    "many other more successful relations , such as the one between the equivalent isotropic energy and the `` peak '' @xmath8-ray energy of grb pulses ( the `` amati relation '' ) are predictions of the cb model ( dar & de rjula  2004 ; dado & dar 2005 ) but not of the fb model .    in the cb model ,",
    "ag flares follow either from cb encounters with density inhomogeneities ( ddd2002 ; dado et al .",
    "2004b ) or from late accretion episodes on the compact central object . in the fb model",
    ", late - time flares result from late central activity ( e.g.  granot , nakar and piran  2003 ) .",
    "although such an activity can neither be predicted nor ruled out , it is not clear why the ensuing ejecta do not also produce @xmath8-ray pulses and why the duration and magnitude of the ag flares scale roughly with the time and magnitude of the declining ag .",
