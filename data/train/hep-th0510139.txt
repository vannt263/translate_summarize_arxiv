    "there is another metric which is defined as the hessian of the energy ( mass ) , it is known as the weinhold metric @xcite @xmath7 the ruppeiner and weinhold metrics are related to each other @xcite via @xmath8 since black holes are regarded as thermodynamic systems @xcite , it is then natural to investigate their thermodynamic geometries .",
    "previous studies @xcite suggest that the thermodynamic geometry of the black holes has a pattern from which one may possibly deduce physical insights . in @xcite",
    "it is found that the divergence of the ruppeiner curvature of the kerr black hold indicates a phase transition .    as a generalization of our previous work @xcite",
    ", we will apply the ruppeiner thermodynamic theory to the higher dimensional black hole solutions which were first derived by myers and perry in 1986 @xcite , in hopes to obtain further structure of black holes and the ruppeiner theory itself . as it turns out",

    ", we set newton s gravitational constant to be @xmath21 in order to eliminate all the @xmath22 s under the square root in ( [ eq : rnhorizon ] ) .",
    "there are two roots , one of which is an outer horizon , @xmath23 while the other is called a cauchy horizon @xmath24 it is obviously seen that @xmath25 this solution develops a singularity when @xmath26 with the singularity at @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 , we have the outer event horizon as in ( [ eq : rnhorizon ] ) .",

    "the area of the event horizon is given by @xmath58 the adm mass of the hole is defined by @xmath59 the angular momentum per unit mass is dimension - dependent , namely @xmath60 by setting @xmath61 we obtain the entropy function of the kerr black hole in @xmath12-dimension as @xmath62 with further algebraic manipulation , we find that even though an explicit entropy function in arbitrary dimension can not be obtained , we can still work in @xmath12 dimensions via the weinhold metric .",
    "the mass function in arbitrary @xmath12 can be written in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 the weinhold metric @xmath65 of the @xmath12-dimensional kerr black hole takes a complicated form , but it is found to be flat as anticipated based on our previous work @xcite .",

    "remarkably , the wedge of the @xmath1 kerr black hole fills the entire light cone .",
    "this is because for black holes in @xmath1 there are no extremal limits .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is a causal structure of state space , but it is determined by curves of constant entropy rather than by the lightcone itself .",
    "the curves of constant entropy for @xmath38 kerr black hole in minkowskian coordinates are given by @xmath81 differentiation of the mass function ( [ eq : kerr - mass ] ) with respect to the entropy gives the temperature of the kerr black hole in arbitrary @xmath12 as @xmath82 this temperature shrinks to zero at extremality for @xmath83 . according to @xcite for @xmath1",

    "the curvature is reduced to @xmath87 which diverges in the extremal limit of the @xmath0 kerr black hole .",
    "for @xmath1 we have a curvature blow - up but not in the limit of extremal black hole , rather at @xmath88 this is where emparan and myers @xcite suggest that the kerr black hole becomes unstable and changes its behavior to be like a black membrane .",

    "a careful observation of ( [ eq : curvature - dim5 ] ) indicates that nothing special happens to the gibbs surface of the kerr black hole _",
    " la _ myers - perry .",
    "this is a case where the entropy of the black hole is a function of three parameters , namely the function of mass and two spins .",

    "the temperature of the @xmath0 double - spin kerr black hole reaches zero in the extremal limit which is given by @xmath117 or explicitly in terms of mass and the two spins as @xmath118 since solving for the entropy function directly is rather complicated , we thus use the same procedure as in the case of the single - spin kerr black hole and obtain the mass as a function of entropy and two angular momenta as @xmath119    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the hessian of @xmath5 with respect to the entropy and two angular momenta yields the weinhold metric , which is found to be curved .",

    "the geometry of black hole thermodynamics in higher dimensional spacetime has a pattern similar to the previous study in @xmath38 spacetime .",
    "since microstructures of black holes are unknown , we can not yet conclude our findings along the same line as those done for the ideal gas @xcite .",
    "examination of our examples shows that when a flat thermodynamic curvature arises , it is the hessian of a function of the form @xmath126 with @xmath127 a constant .",
    "we have checked that such a function always gives a flat thermodynamic metric , regardless of @xmath127 , and regardless of the function @xmath128 .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that inclusion of a cosmological constant leads to curved thermodynamic geometries @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion of the higher dimensional cases .",
    "we note that the calculations of the three - parameter thermodynamic curvature scalars are best achievable by utilization of computer programs for algebraic computations such as classi @xcite and grtensor @xcite for maple .",
    "in this paper , we study thermodynamic geometries of the black hole families and obtain some interesting results , coinciding with our previous findings .",
    "we speculate some sort of duality between entropy and mass of the black hole , which is somewhat corresponding to the very distinction between a rotation parameter and an electric charge .",
