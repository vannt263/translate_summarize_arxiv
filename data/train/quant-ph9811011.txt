    "is it possible to preserve quantum coherence in systems that are irreversibly coupled to the environment ?",
    "apart from being of fundamental interest , this question is of particular significance in the area of quantum information processing @xcite , where the first two - bit quantum gate operations have been demonstrated in quantum optical systems such as trapped ions @xcite , and optical cavities @xcite . in this context",
    "the above question has been answered with `` yes '' through the developement of quantum error correction concepts , in which quantum coherence is preserved by exploiting multi - particle entanglement @xcite .",
    "the realization of quantum gates using nuclear magnetic resonance and spin - spin coupling within a molecule @xcite , has already allowed a test of simple ideas of such correction concepts @xcite .    at present ,",
    "perhaps the most promising implementation of a quantum information processor which comprises a small number of qubits is based on a linear ion trap as first proposed by cirac and zoller @xcite . in most current formulations of such an ion trap computer @xcite ,",
    "the qubits are stored in two electronic ground or metastable states of individual ions while the quantum `` bus '' connecting the various qubits is mediated by the ion s collective motional state either through the center - of - mass ( cm ) or higher excited modes . at the same time , recent experiments have shown that the decoherence effects in systems of trapped ions are dominated by decoherence of the motional state @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore possibilities for motional error correction and to present a scheme which may be used to preserve quantum coherences in the motional state of trapped ions .",
    "we consider a single trapped ion whose motional degrees of freedom undergo finite - temperature dissipative dynamics as described by a thermal master equation @xcite . in this situation",
    "we describe how quantum information , when stored in the motional ( bosonic ) degrees of freedom of a trapped ion , can be encoded in a way which allows its active stabilisation .",
    "for the zero - temperature case we explicitely demonstrate how such a stabilisation can be implemented in a trapped - ion system .",
    "this stabilisation can correct for the loss of a single excitation in the motional state and needs only a single ion while making use of two of the three degrees of freedom of the ion s motion .",
    "such stabilisation techniques could be used to stabilise the `` bus '' from the effects of decoherence or , more speculatively , the stored qubits in a bosonic quantum computer @xcite .",
    "we will describe decoherence using the quantum jump approach @xcite and base our stabilisation scheme on the concept of `` quantum jump inversion '' @xcite . to begin with",
    ", we briefly review some of the underlying ideas and give an overview of the method that we will use to stabilise the quantum information . in section",
    "[ trapping ] we outline the physics of the motion of the trapped ion while in section [ dissipation ] we go into detail regarding the short - time dissipative evolution and the derivation of the specific qubit encoding which allows the active stabilisation of the stored quantum information . in section [ detection ]",
    "we describe our method of periodically detecting whether a quantum jump has occurred and if so , determine the type of jump .",
    "this step will involve a projective measurement of the ion s electronic states which does not significantly disturb the motion , a process which we discuss in section [ projection ] .",
    "finally , in section [ repair ] , we show how the unitary inversion of the detected decoherence effects ( quantum jumps ) can be effected through adiabatic processes .",
    "our scheme is based on the concept of `` quantum jump inversion '' which was first presented by mabuchi and zoller @xcite and represents a special example of the general formalism of reversible quantum operations as studied in detail by nielsen and caves @xcite .",
    "we will make some use of their results in the following and briefly review them here , together with the underlying description of decoherence through the formalism of quantum trajectories @xcite and the quantum jump approach @xcite .    in quantum optics ,",
    "decoherence is described by coupling the system to an infinitely large reservoir which models the environment .",
    "the couplings between the system operators and the reservoir operators are usually assumed to be weak and linear .",
    "this allows one to derive a markovian master equation for the dynamics of the system reduced density operator @xmath0 after tracing over the reservoir degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the general form of this master equation is @xmath1      \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\sum_{m=0}^{n }   \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\{{\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{m}}{\\hat{c}_{m}}\\ro + \\ro{\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{m}}{\\hat{c}_{m } } -   2{\\hat{c}_{m}}\\ro{\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{m } } \\right\\}\\ , , \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the system hamiltonian and the operators @xmath3 describe the different decay channels to the environment .",
    "the @xmath3 originate from the linear coupling between system and environment and are proportional to the system operators which couple to the reservoir .",
    "an alternative approach to open quantum systems has been developed which describes the system through an ensemble of pure state evolutions through the formalism of quantum trajectories @xcite . in this method",
    "the system is continuously monitored by performing measurements on the state of the reservoir .",
    "different measurement strategies lead to different conditioned evolutions of the system which are termed unravelings .",
    "more specifically , in the quantum jump method @xcite , one obtains an unraveling of the master equation as arising from the conditioned evolution of the system where the conditioning is supplied by detecting the loss of system excitations through the counting of quanta in the environment . in the absence of any measurement counts",
    "the system evolution is governed by the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath4 which differs from the system hamiltonian @xmath2 due to the information that we acquire from not observing any counts . on the other hand , the information obtained from a detector count at a time @xmath5 , associated with the decay channel @xmath6 , conditions the state of the system according to @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe the state of the system immediately before and after the quantum jump , respectively .    in their article , mabuchi and zoller @xcite",
    "have formulated conditions for the reversibility of quantum jumps through unitary operations .",
    "we adopt here the more general notation of nielsen and caves @xcite for the reversibility of quantum operations .",
    "nielsen and caves have shown that , given the initial state @xmath10 of a quantum system is _ known _ to lie in a specific subspace @xmath11 , of the entire system hilbert space @xmath12 and the subspace @xmath13 has the property @xmath14 then the action of the quantum operation as described by @xmath15 is unitarily reversible . in other words , given eq.([nccond ] ) then there exists a unitary operation @xmath16 such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a real constant @xcite . to illustrate the condition in eq.([nccond ] ) , consider a system with a single bosonic degree of freedom , such as the electric field inside a single - mode resonator , and where @xmath13 is a two dimensional subspace of @xmath19 and is spanned by two basis states @xmath20 and @xmath21 if the quantum operation @xmath22 , and describes a quantum jump corresponding to the loss of a photon from the resonator , then eq.([nccond ] ) implies that _ all _ states @xmath23 possess the same mean cavity excitation number . alternatively , eq.([nccond ] ) is satisfied if the basis states @xmath20 and @xmath24 are orthogonal , where @xmath25 possess the same mean excitation number _ and _ remain orthogonal after the quantum jump .",
    "it is clear that in this situation the coherence present in the subspace @xmath13 ( in the form of a coherent superposition of the states @xmath20 and @xmath24 ) is not damaged through the action of the quantum operation @xmath15 and it can be restored to the state prior to the quantum jump through a unitary process . mabuchi and zoller have exploited this fact to preserve quantum coherences in a specially constructed situation in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) @xcite .",
    "following their work , mensky @xcite has studied the inversion of quantum jumps under the aspect of measurement reversibility .",
    "more recently , vitali _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed cqed schemes which are similar in spirit to that of ref.@xcite to protect quantum states in cavities employing continuous feedback methods .      in the following",
    "we outline how the strategy of quantum jump inversion can be modified and implemented to stabilise a qubit which is stored in the motional degrees of freedom of a trapped ion .",
    "the implementation of a quantum jump inversion scheme requires _ a priori _ knowledge about the decay channels that describe the effects of decoherence as in eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "we will assume that the motional degrees of freedom undergo finite - temperature dissipative dynamics which are described by a thermal master equation @xcite . as we will show below , to derive a qubit encoding which allows the unitary inversion of the quantum jumps associated with this type of decoherence",
    ", it is sufficient to examine the case of a zero - temperature bath .",
    "this will considerably simplify our analysis .",
    "irrespective of the particular choice of bath , the exact inversion of a quantum jump will require : ( i ) a special choice of motional subspace @xmath13 in which to encode a qubit such that the quantum jumps associated with a given type of decoherence are unitarily reversible , ( ii ) a mechanism for detecting quantum jumps without much disturbance of the motion , and ( iii ) a procedure which accomplishes the unitary inversion of the detected decoherence effect . while ( i ) is difficult , to satisfy ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "represents a serious challenge for an operational quantum jump inversion strategy .    before we go into more detail about how the above mentioned requirements can be met in the physical situation of a trapped ion we mark the following general considerations .",
    "the effects of motional decoherence that have been observed in recent trapped ion experiments are believed to be due to technical noise @xcite . in this situation , even though one can obtain master equations for the motional dynamics of the ions @xcite , it is difficult to isolate the particular environment to which the system is coupled . even in those cases where a physical quantum bath can be identified ,",
    "it is extremely difficult to monitor the system through the quantum information transferred to the reservoir .",
    "the energies of the motional excitations are too small to be easily detected .",
    "thus , to determine if a quantum jump has occurred we propose to _ periodically perform projective measurements _ on the system directly without gaining any information on the stored quantum superposition , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this is a significant difference to the original formulation of a quantum jump inversion scheme @xcite , where the dissipative system dynamics are _ continuously _ monitored by imposing detectors directly on the environment output channels and it makes our scheme more akin to quantum error correction schemes @xcite .",
    "the main consequence of this modification lies in the fact that our quantum jump detection scheme can not reveal when in the time interval between successive projective measurements the quantum jump occurred .",
    "we will however still be able to unitarily invert the decoherence effects caused by such a jump .    to deduce the proper encoding for the qubit we examine , in section [ dissipation ]",
    ", the effects of motional decoherence associated with a zero - temperature master equation given that the initial motional state of the system @xmath26 lies in the subspace @xmath27 , which is spanned by two basis states @xmath28 and where @xmath19 is the entire motional hilbert space .",
    "as mentioned above this is sufficient to obtain an encoding which allows the unitary inversion of the quantum jumps associated with the more general , finite - temperature reservoir .",
    "based on the condition given in eq.([nccond ] ) we show that for the decoherence effects to be unitarily reversible both in the case of a detected quantum jump , and in the absence of a detection event , requires that the basis states @xmath25 comprise of at least two bosonic modes .",
    "we therefore propose to encode the qubit as @xmath29 in two of the ion s motional degrees of freedom .",
    "in this situation , the effects of decoherence cause the system to evolve into a mixed state @xmath30 on a time scale which is short compared with the characteristic decay time . here ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 since the projective measurements which accomplish the detection of quantum jumps need to discriminate between the three parts in the above mixture , we require the three subspaces @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be mutually orthogonal . these constraints will lead us to the choice @xmath37 for the basis motional states where @xmath38 denotes a two - dimensional motional fock state .",
    "the detection of quantum jumps in the motional state of the trapped ion represents step ( i ) in the schematic depiction of our stabilisation scheme given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this step consists of two parts .",
    "first , a raman induced process serves to entangle the mixed state given above in eq.([8 ] ) , with orthogonal electronic states of the ion , thereby transferring information about the occurrence of quantum jumps into the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "following this entanglement operation , which we discuss in section [ entanglement ] , we perform a measurement of the ion s electronic degrees of freedom which projects the state from the mixture in eq.([8 ] ) into a pure state .",
    "the projection could , in principle , be done using quantum jump techniques @xcite . however , in the situation where we aim to protect the motional state of an ion from the effects of decoherence we can not tolerate the recoil from scattering a large number of photons as this would lead to motional excitation and irreversibly change the motional state @xcite . instead , for the second step of the quantum jump detection , we propose in section [ projection ] an alternative projective measurement which is based on the `` photon gun '' scheme discussed by gheri _",
    "@xcite , where the ion is surrounded by a low - q optical cavity .",
    "dependent on the ion s electronic state a laser pulse triggers the transmission of a single - photon state out of the cavity where the projection can be accomplished through photodetection . in the lamb - dicke limit @xcite",
    "we can practically eliminate any motional recoil suffered by the ion while still obtaining a signal whether a quantum jump has occurred or not . in effect",
    ", we are coupling in another output channel to interrogate the system in addition to those channels coupling the system to the reservoir .",
    "the unitary inversion of the detected quantum jumps which is schematically depicted as step ( ii ) in fig.[fig1 ] represents perhaps the most essential part of the stabilization scheme .",
    "this is addressed in section [ repair ] . in the case",
    "where no quantum jump has been detected the ion is left in its initial motional state as given in eq.([encoding ] ) and no further manipulation is required to restore the quantum information to the original basis states . in the case where a quantum jump has been detected ,",
    "we describe , using two adiabatic transfer processes and an intermediate resonant step , how one can unitarily invert the decoherence effects associated with this quantum jump .",
    "the involved processes have the advantage that they are mostly achieved via adiabatic passage and thus are not subject to noise due to spontaneous emission nor do they suffer from the strict timing constraints imposed by resonant processes .",
    "the laser arrangements needed to effect this unitary inversion of the detected decoherence effects are not overly complex and may be experimentally feasible .    in our analysis of the processes that constitute step ( i ) and ( ii ) in the schematic depiction of our stabilisation scheme in fig.[fig1",
    "] we will neglect all effects of decoherence during the corresponding operations .",
    "in this situation , if the detection and inversion processes are performed with a period @xmath39 which is rapid when compared with the characteristic decoherence time @xmath40 the probability for more than one quantum jump to occur in between two successive projective measurements becomes negligible since this is proportional to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the detection and unitary inversion of single quantum jumps then stabilises the quantum information stored in the system .",
    "the stabilisation scheme presented here allows the deterministic ( unitary ) restoration of quantum information which is to be contrasted with previous proposals where the correction contains probabilistic ( non - unitary ) elements @xcite .",
    "here we briefly introduce the trapping model that we use for the analysis of our stabilisation scheme .",
    "this includes the description of the quantised motion of the trapped ion , the relevant internal electronic structure and the associated decoherence effects .",
    "consider the quantized cm motion of a single ion which is confined within a trap potential that can be closely approximated as being harmonic and which is characterized by the three frequencies of oscillation , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 along the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 directions @xcite . as mentioned above we propose to encode the qubit in the two bosonic degrees of freedom which are represented by the ion s harmonic motion along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions .",
    "we restrict our analysis to those two motional degrees of freedom since the ion s motion along the @xmath47 direction plays no role in our scheme .",
    "the only decoherence effect that we include in our model is motional decoherence . to avoid any loss of quantum coherence within the electronic degrees of freedom we require a scheme in which spontaneous emission is highly suppressed .",
    "we therefore assume that the relevant electronic degrees of freedom form a @xmath48 system as depicted in fig.[fig2](a ) , and that the electronic dynamics are confined to the two states @xmath49 and @xmath50 which we choose to be two ground state hyperfine levels .",
    "these are coupled by m1 and e2 transitions at best so that we can safely neglect any spontaneous emission between those states @xcite . at the same time",
    "the @xmath51 transition can be driven by two laser beams connecting the ground states @xmath49 and @xmath50 through a common excited state @xmath52 in a stimulated raman scheme @xcite , which we briefly review in appendix [ ramanapp ] . to give a specific example for the realization of an effective three - level scheme as indicated in fig.[fig2](a ) we have drawn in fig.[fig2](b ) the relevant energy level structure of @xmath53 which , for example , was used in a series of experiments in the group of wineland at nist @xcite .    because the trap potential is harmonic ,",
    "the position and momentum operators can be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators for the trap quanta @xmath54 and similarly for @xmath55 and where @xmath6 is the mass of the ion .",
    "the free hamiltonian of the system then takes the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the energy of the two ground state hyperfine levels and @xmath59 is the energy of the electronic excited state .",
    "we assume that the motional degrees of freedom in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions undergo finite - temperature dissipative dynamics which are described by a master equation of the form given in eq.([2 ] ) , and where the associated decay channels are described by the operators @xmath60 and the quantity @xmath61 gives the mean excitation number of the reservoir @xcite .",
    "note that for simplicity we have assumed the decay rate @xmath62 to be the same for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions . in section [ dissipation",
    "] , we show how a qubit can be encoded in the motional degrees of freedom , such that the quantum jumps associated with the decay channel operators given in eq.([60 ] ) can be unitarily inverted . in sections [ detection ] and [ repair ] where we present our specific proposal for the implementation of a stabilisation scheme in a trapped - ion system",
    "we specialize to the zero - temperature case where @xmath63 and we are left with the channel operators @xmath64 we have chosen this simple form of decoherence to exemplify our general strategy and to give an explicit implementation for all the steps in our stabilisation scheme .",
    "in this section we discuss the dissipative system evolution and , given the form of the master equation as in eq.([2 ] ) together with the channel operators in eq.([60 ] ) , deduce the orthogonal basis states @xmath65 which allow the unitary inversion of the associated decoherence effects .",
    "we refer to such states as _",
    "before we go into more detail about the dissipative system evolution , we note that for the derivation of stable basis states for a finite - temperature master equation it is sufficient to consider the zero - temperature case .",
    "the reason for this is that the unitary reversibility of a quantum jump associated with the decay channel @xmath66 implies the unitary reversibility of a quantum jump through the decay channel @xmath67 .",
    "this becomes clear from the following argument .",
    "if a subspace @xmath13 satisfies the condition given in eq.([nccond ] ) for the quantum operation @xmath68 which describes a quantum jump through the decay channel @xmath66 , then the subspace @xmath13 also satisfies the condition in eq.([nccond ] ) for the quantum operation @xmath69 associated with the decay channel @xmath70 this follows directly from the form of the channel operators as in eq.([60 ] ) and the commutation relation @xmath71 = 1,$ ] for the bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the same argument holds for the decay channels @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the following we will therefore only consider the zero - temperature case where the dissipative system dynamics are described by the master equation @xmath74 with the channel operators @xmath75 and where we have transformed into the interaction picture of @xmath76 which is given in eq.([20 ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we have further assumed that the system is only subject to its free dynamics .",
    "we are interested in the decoherence effects during the time interval @xmath77,$ ] in between two of the successive projective measurements which serve to detect quantum jumps ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . to examine these decoherence effects in more detail consider the system evolution starting from the initially pure state @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the initial electronic state which we include for completeness here although it remains unaffected by the dissipative evolution .",

    "the three terms in the mixture have the following interpretation .",
    "the first term corresponds to the system evolving without any quantum jumps , whereas the second and the third term describe the dissipative effects of a single quantum jump through the decay channel @xmath66 and @xmath72 , respectively , without specifying the exact time of the jump . from eq.([180 ] ) the three contributions to the mixture can be further evaluated to give @xmath100   \\sqrt{p_{1_x 0_y } } { |\\psi_{1_x 0_y}(\\tau)\\rangle } & = &       \\sqrt{\\frac{e^{\\gamma\\tau}-1}{\\gamma } }      { \\hat{c}_{x}}{\\hat{u}({\\tau } ) } \\rstatev\\ , ,   \\label{xjumpstate } \\\\[2ex ]   \\sqrt{p_{0_x 1_y } } { |\\psi_{0_x 1_y}(\\tau)\\rangle } & = &       \\sqrt{\\frac{e^{\\gamma\\tau}-1}{\\gamma } }      { \\hat{c}_{y}}{\\hat{u}({\\tau } ) } \\rstatev\\ , ,   \\label{yjumpstate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 has been defined in eq.([200 ] ) .",

    "we note that recent work on the more formal aspects of states of bosonic systems that can be stabilized in the presence of a zero - temperature reservoir has also uncovered the states given in eq.([mystates ] ) and many more complicated multi - mode states @xcite .",

    "more specifically , based on our specific choice of encoding information in the motional basis states derived in eq.([mystates ] ) , we present a method that determines whether a quantum jump associated with the decay channel @xmath66 or @xmath72 has occurred .",
    "the corresponding processes constitute step ( i ) in our stabilisation scheme as depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the detection of a quantum jump is accomplished in two steps .",
    "the first step serves to generate an `` error syndrome '' which only carries information about the effects of decoherence .",
    "to be more specific , given that the initial electronic state of the ion @xmath158 we show in section [ entanglement ] how to entangle the mixed state that results from the decoherence processes , as in eq.([260 ] ) , with the electronic states @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in essence , we generate a unitary operator @xmath159 , which , in its generic form , is described by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a specific subspace of the ion s motional hilbert space and @xmath162 is the orthocomplement of @xmath161 .",
    "it is important that this operation leaves the motional state @xmath26 unaffected .",

    "the above entanglement process produces a binary signature in form of the ion s electronic state which serves as our error syndrome .",
    "the second step of our quantum jump detection scheme serves to `` read out '' this error syndrome .",
    "this is accomplished through a projective measurement of the ion s electronic state which we discuss in section [ projection ] . following the entanglement operation given in eq.([mapping ] ) , the detection of the ion in the electronic state @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) amounts to projecting the motional state of the ion onto the subspace @xmath162 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "before we describe in detail how the error syndrome can be generated and read out we briefly elaborate further on the sequence of operations which constitute step ( i ) in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "first , the detection of a quantum jump associated with the decay channel @xmath66 is accomplished through constructing the entanglement operation such that @xmath165 in eq.([mapping ] ) .",
    "a subsequent measurement of the ion in the electronic state @xmath166 is then equivalent to the detection of a quantum jump as described by eq.([xjumpstate ] ) , and the motion of the ion is projected into the pure state given in eq.([xjstate ] ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the projective measurement yields the result @xmath167 , for the electronic state of the ion , _ no _ quantum jump associated with the decay channel @xmath66 has occurred and the ion is left in a mixture of the states given in eqs.([nojstate ] ) and ( [ yjstate ] ) .",
    "irrespective of the outcome of this first projective measurement we then determine whether or not a quantum jump associated with the decay channel @xmath72 has occured . the corresponding procedure is identical to the one which serves to detect a quantum jump through the decay channel @xmath66 but where now @xmath168 for generating the error syndrome .",
    "if through the first measurement we have detected a quantum jump associated with the decay channel @xmath66 the outcome of the second measurement will always be @xmath167 and we do not obtain further information .",
    "however , for the case where no quantum jump through the decay channel @xmath66 has occured , the outcome @xmath169 for the second projective measurement corresponds to the detection of a quantum jump as described by eq.([yjumpstate ] ) and projects the ion into the pure motional state given in eq.([yjstate ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the measurement of the ion in the electronic state @xmath167 for a second time implies that no quantum jump has occurred through either of the decay channels and the ion is projected into the pure motional state given in eq.([nojstate ] ) .",
    "the second projective measurement thereby completes the sequence of operations that constitute step ( i ) in fig.[fig1 ] and leaves the ion in a definite , pure motional state . from this",
    "the original motional state can be restored in step ( ii ) of our stabilisation scheme as indicated in fig.[fig1 ] and as we describe in section [ repair ] . in the following we now detail the processes which accomplish the generation and reading out of the error syndrome .",
    "the physical process that we use to generate the essential part of the entanglement operation given in eq.([mapping ] ) is a resonant stimulated raman transition between the two ground states @xmath49 and @xmath50 in a specific laser geometry .",
    "this generates rabi oscillations between the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 where the rabi frequency depends on the ion s motional state .",
    "an essential requirement for the generation of the desired entanglement is the accurate control of the phases acquired through these rabi oscillations .",
    "we therefore consider time dependent laser pulses characterized through their dimensionless pulse shape @xmath170 to generate the raman transitions , and the phase of the rabi oscillations is controlled through the generalized pulse area @xmath171 for the generation of the error syndrome associated with the decay channels @xmath66 and @xmath72 , we will be interested in the case where the raman - induced rabi oscillations are only sensitive to the ion s motion along one of the principal axes .",

    "we proposed a method which , through coupling the ion to a low - q optical resonator , can transfer this electronic information to the environment with very little disturbance to the motion .",

    "the entanglement ( section [ entanglement ] ) , and unitary inversion ( section [ repair ] ) , steps utilized , at most , two pairs of raman lasers .",
    "this should be experimentally feasible .",
    "the repair operation described here is completely unitary , and does not make recourse to any non - unitary probabilistic operations . thus it should be ideally suited to operate on single systems such as the ions in a quantum computer .",
    "in addition to being stable against the effects of a zero - temperature bath , we have shown that the particular encoding found is also stable against the effects of a thermal bath .",
    "this result might prove very significant as thermal noise plays a large role in the systematic sources of decoherence in trapped ions @xcite .",
    "however , we have restricted our discussion regarding the quantum jump detection and inversion processes to the case of a zero - temperature bath .",
    "the case of a thermal bath will be better formulated when the separate issue of the generation of any given motional unitary operator has been solved .",
    "the entire process of restoration was made possible by the _ a priori _ knowledge of the type of dissipation present . in a typical experiment",
    ", there will be many varied sources of noise and for the above stabilisation to be useful , information concerning the various sources decoherence must be experimentally obtained .",
