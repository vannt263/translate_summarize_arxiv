    "gibbsian processes were introduced by r.  l.  dobrushin ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , o.  e.  lanford and d.  ruelle ( see @xcite ) as a model for equilibrium states in statistical physics .",
    "( for general results on gibbs measures on a d - dimensional lattice we refer to the books of h .- o .",
    "georgii @xcite , b.  simon @xcite and y.  g.  sinai @xcite , which cover a wide range of phenomena . ) the first results concerned existence and uniqueness of gibbs measures and the structure of the set of gibbs measures related to a given potential .",
    "the question of uniqueness is of special importance , as the non - uniqueness of gibbs measures can be interpreted as a certain type of phase transition occurring within the particle system .",
    "a phase transition occurs whenever a symmetry of the potential is broken , so it is natural to ask , under which conditions symmetries are broken or conserved .",
    "the answer to this question depends on the type of the symmetry ( discrete or continuous ) , the number of spatial dimensions and smoothness and decay conditions on the potential ( see @xcite , chapters 6.2 , 8 , 9 and 20 ) . it turns out that the case of continuous symmetries in two dimensions is especially interesting .",
    "the first progress in this case was achieved by m.  d.  mermin and h.  wagner , who showed for special two - dimensional lattice models that continuous internal symmetries are conserved ( @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite r.  l.  dobrushin and s.  b.  shlosman",
    "established conservation of symmetries for more general potentials which satisfy smoothness and decay conditions , and c .- e .",
    "pfister improved this in @xcite . later",
    "also continuum systems were considered : s. shlosman obtained results for continuous internal symmetries ( @xcite ) , while j.  frhlich and c .- e .",
    "pfister treated the case of translation of point particles ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "all these results rely on the smoothness of the interaction , but in @xcite d.  ioffe , s.  shlosman and y.  velenik were able to relax this condition . considering a lattice model they showed that continuous internal symmetries are conserved , whenever the interaction can be decomposed into a smooth part and a part which is small with respect to @xmath0-norm , using a perturbation expansion and percolation theory .",
    "we generalised this to a point particle setting ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ here we will investigate the conservation of translational symmetry for non - smooth , singular or hard - core potentials in a point particle setting .",
    "while we treat non - smoothness by generalising ideas used in @xcite , we will give an approach to singular potentials which is different from the one given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that integrability condition ( 2.13 ) of @xcite is simplified and relaxed and the case of hard - core potentials can easily be included .",
    "thus we are able to show the conservation of translational symmetry for the pure hard core model , for example .",
    "+ in section [ secresult ] we will first confine ourselves to this special case of pure hard core repulsion .",
    "the corresponding result ( theorem [ purehardcore ] ) is of interest on its own and its proof shows how to deal with hard cores in the general case . for this general case",
    "we then define a suitable class of potentials ( definition [ defgapprox ] ) , give some sufficient conditions for potentials to belong to that class ( lemmas [ lepotglatt ] and  [ lepotchar ] ) and state the general result obtained ( theorem [ sym ] ) .",
    "the precise setting is then given in section [ secsetting ] .",
    "the proofs of the lemmas from sections [ secresult ] and [ secsetting ] are relegated to section [ secleset ] . in sections [ secproofcore ] and [ secproofsym ]",

    "the proofs of the corresponding lemmas are relegated to sections [ secleproofcore ] and [ secleproofsym ] respectively . in the proof of the general case arguments of the special case",
    "have to be modified and refined by new concepts and ideas at several instances .",
