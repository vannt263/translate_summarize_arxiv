    "hadron production at intermediate @xmath4 in heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) has been successfully described in the recombination model ( rm ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the hadronization process is shown to be dominated by the recombination of thermal and shower partons when @xmath4 is in the range @xmath5 gev / c .",
    "the distributions of those shower partons are derived by fitting the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) in the rm @xcite .",
    "the shower partons considered are not to be identified with those due to gluon radiation at very high virtuality that are calculable in pqcd , since the ones we consider are defined by their recombination within a jet to form a hadron at the hadronization scale , and are not calculable in pqcd . in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of fragmentation in the framework of recombination , and calculate the ffs for proton and @xmath6 using the shower parton distributions ( spds ) that have been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite from fitting the ffs for mesons .",
    "the determination of ff for proton in a jet that can agree with data would be a significant achievement , since it is the first time a ff is obtained by calculation , instead of by fitting .",
    "it should be stated from the outset that we are not concerned with @xmath0 evolution here , since that part of the problem is well handled by pqcd @xcite-@xcite .",
    "all evolutions have to start from somewhere , and the starting distributions have to be determined by fitting the data . in refs .",
    "@xcite the ffs have been parameterized for a variety of initiating partons and final hadrons , and have all been determined independently apart from trivial identities . to our knowledge",
    "no one has attempted to relate one ff to another .",
    "our attempt to relate @xmath7 and @xmath8 , ffs for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , is feasible because our emphasis is on the hadronization of the shower partons .",
    "thus a successful connection among the ffs is an affirmation of the soundness of the recombination formalism that we employ , and establishes an important link among the multitude of ffs .",
    "we first recall how we have treated the fragmentation of gluon into pion in the framework of recombination .",
    "the basic equation is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ff of gluon into pion , and @xmath13 is the recombination function ( rf ) for @xmath14 that is given in ref .",
    "@xmath15 is the spd of @xmath16 or @xmath17 in a gluon jet , and the symmetrization symbol in eq .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) , not analytically , but by fitting the ff at a chosen @xmath0 .",
    "the form for @xmath19 used is @xmath20 for @xmath21 gev@xmath3 the values of the parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of these parameters for other values of @xmath0 has been considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath27 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in the context of parton recombination , and is the distribution at the hadronization scale of a light quark ( or antiquark ) in a gluon - initiated jet .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath28 and @xmath29 are to recombine to form a pion at @xmath30 , which is constrained by @xmath13 to be @xmath31 .",
    "we now advance the point of view that if eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) makes sense in describing ff in terms of the recombination of shower partons , then the same formalism should make possible a calculation of the ff of gluon into proton .",
    "indeed , we need only generalize eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) in the self - evident way @xmath32 where @xmath33\\ ,   \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there being six terms in the permutation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is an initial form of the ff of gluon into proton , on which modification will be made in the following .",
    "@xmath37 is the rf for the proton @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40^{-1}$ ] , @xmath41 being the euler - beta function .",
    "the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xcite @xmath44    we do not regard @xmath45 as the final form for the ff because we have not so far taken into account the momentum carried by the antiproton that must accompany the production of a proton in a gluon jet . to treat the pair production of @xmath46 , we have to consider the correlation between the dibaryon produced . if @xmath47 denotes the @xmath46 ff , then upon integration over @xmath29 we should have on general grounds @xmath48 which does not imply factorizability of @xmath49 .",
    "we shall apply the momentum constraint @xmath50 as the only correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath51 , and write @xmath52\\ .",
    "\\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] commensurate to eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , we approximate @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) by @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 can be evaluated from @xmath56 the result for @xmath57 is shown in fig .  1 by the solid line .",
    "also shown in that figure in dashed line is the ff obtained by kkp @xcite by fitting the data in nlo .",
    "the agreement over 5 orders of magnitude is very good , considering the fact that no free parameters have been used in the calculation .",
    "in this section we consider two other ffs into baryons , first @xmath58 , and then @xmath59 .",
    "for the former eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) is replaced by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the spd of a strange quark in a gluon jet , and @xmath62 is the rf for @xmath6 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath63 is parameterized as in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , but with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) but with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus @xmath74 can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and then modified as before to give @xmath75 by taking the momentum of @xmath76 into account , as done in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the result is shown by the solid line in fig .  2 .",
    "for comparison , we show in the same figure the lo and nlo distributions of @xmath58 at @xmath21 gev@xmath3 given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although our result is a little lower in the mid-@xmath30 region , the agreement is nevertheless acceptable ; in fact , it agrees better with the lo result .",
    "next , we consider proton production in a jet initiated by a @xmath77 quark . in that case",
    "valence and sea quark distributions must be distinguished . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have used @xmath78 and @xmath79 to denote the valence and sea quark spds , respectively ; they are parameterized as in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with the parameters for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the recombination formula is now @xmath82 where @xmath83 for @xmath51 production in the same jet valence quark does not contribute , so for @xmath84 the sea quark distribution @xmath85 replaces @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) . the resultant @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "are then substituted into @xmath89 the ff thus obtained is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "the parametrization of the data by kkp @xcite , shown in the dashed line , is , however , unreliable because an invalid assumption , @xmath90 , has been used in the analysis . while we await an improved analysis of the data , the solid line in fig .",
    "3 may be regarded as our prediction of the ff for @xmath77 quark into @xmath10 .",
    "we have calculated the ffs into baryons , using the spds determined by fitting the ffs into mesons .",
    "the results are in good agreement with data for @xmath91 and @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath59 there is no reliable analysis of the data , so our result is a prediction . to be able to relate meson and baryon ffs is an attribute of our formalism that treats fragmentation as a recombination process .",
    "since the shower partons are defined at the hadronization scale , their distributions can not be calculated from first principles .",
    "nevertheless , they have been determined by fitting ffs for mesons , inasmuch as the ffs themselves have been determined by fitting the data .",
    "what we have achieved in this paper is to elevate the significance of the formalism that connects previously unrelated ffs . that not only confirms the internal consistency of the formalism , but also renders additional support to the reliability of the procedure employed earlier in the study of the contribution of thermal - shower recombination to hadron production ( mesons and baryons ) at intermediate @xmath4 in hic .",
    "the experience gained through this work on baryon production builds the basis for future investigation of correlations that involve baryons produced at intermediate @xmath4 in hic .",
    "data on such correlations from experiments at rhic already exists @xcite . whether a baryon is the trigger particle or an associate particle ,",
    "it is clear that the recombination model is well positioned to address the problem of hadronization of various partons that arise from different sources ( hard and soft ) in hic .",
