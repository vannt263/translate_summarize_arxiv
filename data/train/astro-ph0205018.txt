    "current models for the generation of coherent radio emission of pulsars require formation of free @xmath1 pairs in the pulsar magnetospheres ( e.g. , ruderman & sutherland @xcite ; michel @xcite ; melrose @xcite ; usov @xcite ) .",
    "such pairs may be created via conversion of @xmath2-rays into @xmath1 pairs in a strong magnetic field , @xmath3 ( erber @xcite ) . besides , some ( if not all ) pulsars are powerful sources of @xmath2-ray emission ( e.g. , hartmann @xcite ; thompson et al .",
    "@xcite ; daugherty & harding @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , propagation of @xmath2-rays in the magnetosphere is one of the central problems in the theory of pulsars ( usov & melrose @xcite ; harding , baring & gonthier @xcite ; baring & harding @xcite and references therein ) .    in the magnetospheres of pulsars",
    "the plasma dispersion for @xmath2-rays is negligible , and to understand the process of @xmath2-ray propagation in the vicinity of a pulsar it suffices to consider propagation in the vacuum polarized by a strong magnetic field ( e.g. usov & melrose @xcite ; bulik @xcite ) .",
    "the principal modes of propagation for a photon in the magnetized vacuum are linearly polarized with the photon electric field either perpendicular ( @xmath4 mode ) or parallel ( @xmath5 mode ) to the plane formed by the external magnetic field @xmath6 and the photon wave vector @xmath7 .",
    "both modes are generated in the magnetospheres of pulsars ( baring & harding @xcite ) .",
    "a single photon in either mode can decay into a free @xmath1 pair provided that a relevant threshold , @xmath8 for @xmath5 mode and @xmath9 for @xmath4 mode , is exceeded , where @xmath10 is the photon energy , @xmath11  g , @xmath12^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath13 is the angle between the photon wave vector @xmath7 and the magnetic field @xmath6 . for typical magnetic fields of pulsars , @xmath14  g , the absorption coefficient for photo - pair production is at least a few orders of magnitude higher than the absorption coefficient for any other inelastic interaction of photons and magnetic fields ( adler @xcite ) .",
    "however , for all known pulsars , @xmath2-rays generated near the neutron star surface are produced in a state below the pair creation threshold ( usov & melrose @xcite ; baring & harding @xcite ) . in this case , the process of pair creation by single photons is kinematically forbidden , and the main ( inelastic ) interaction of photons and the magnetic field is a splitting into two photons @xmath15 ( adler @xcite ; stoneham @xcite ; melrose @xcite ; baring @xcite ) .",
    "adler ( @xcite ) showed that in the limit of weak dispersion , where the refractive indices for both modes are very close to unity , only @xmath4 mode may undergo the splitting process .",
    "near the threshold of pair creation , however , the dispersion law differs considerably from the vacuum case , @xmath16 , and the weak - dispersion limit is no longer applicable ( shabad @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization selection rules for photon splitting with taking into account the resonant dispersion law near the threshold of free pair creation were discussed by usov & shabad ( @xcite ) .",
    "later , it was shown that bound @xmath1 pairs ( positronium ) may be created by single photons in a strong magnetic field ( shabad & usov @xcite , @xcite ; herold , ruder , & wunner @xcite ; usov & shabad @xcite ; usov & melrose @xcite ) . the threshold of bound pair creation is slightly below the threshold of free pair creation , and therefore , creation of bound pairs may be allowed while creation of free pairs is forbidden yet .",
    "the dispersion curves corrected by taking into account formation of the mixed photon - positronium states were calculated in ( shabad & usov @xcite ) .",
    "these dispersion curves near and below the thresholds of pair creation differ significantly from the photon dispersion curves calculated by shabad ( @xcite ) and used in ( usov & shabad @xcite ) . in this paper , using the corrected dispersion curves ( shabad & usov @xcite ) the polarization selection rules for splitting of both modes in a superstrong ( @xmath17 ) magnetic field are considered .",
    "in a time - independent , spatially uniform external magnetic field @xmath6 , the dispersion curve for the principal mode of polarization @xmath18 @xmath19 may be written in the following general form ( e.g. , shabad @xcite ; usov & shabad @xcite )    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the frequency of state ( photon , positronium atom or their mixture ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the components of the wave vector along and across the magnetic field @xmath6 , and @xmath24 is a certain function of @xmath25 . in a superstrong magnetic field for the @xmath5 mode below the threshold of free pair creation , @xmath26 , we have ( usov & shabad @xcite ; shabad & usov @xcite )    @xmath27 ^ 2 + 4 a(k^2_\\perp ) } \\,\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ]    where    @xmath28    @xmath29 is the rest energy of positronium in the ground state when the coulomb quantum number and the landau numbers of the electron and the positron are zero ( @xmath30 ) ,    @xmath31 ^ 2\\ ] ]    is the binding energy , @xmath32 is the longitudinal wave function of the positronium with the constituent particles taken at the same points ( @xmath33 ) ,    @xmath34    @xmath35 is the bohr radius , @xmath36 is the radius of the electron orbit , and @xmath37 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the dispersion curve of the @xmath5 mode which is given by equations ( 1)-(5 ) is photon - like for @xmath38 , and positronium - like for @xmath39 ( see fig .  1 ) . at @xmath40 ,",
    "this curve describes the mixed photon - positronium state .",
    "the positronium states of the lowest series ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , including the boundary of its continuum @xmath43 , do not contribute into the polarization operator of a @xmath4-polarized state ( shabad & usov @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the dispersion curve @xmath44 for the @xmath4 mode crosses the positronium spectra of the lowest series without interfering with them ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "as @xmath45 grows further , this curve approaches eventually the dispersion curve of positronium at the state with @xmath46 and @xmath47 when either the electron or the positron is at the first excited landau level ( shabad & usov @xcite ) .    at @xmath17 , the geometrical optics or adiabatic approximation is valid for propagation of @xmath2-rays in the pulsar magnetospheres ( usov & melrose @xcite and references therein ) . in this case",
    ", the curvature of the magnetic field lines causes @xmath2-rays of both modes to shift along the relevant dispersion curves ( see fig .  1 ) . in the process of propagation",
    ", @xmath2-rays that are created significantly below the threshold of pair creation can pass through the mixed photon - positronium states and turns into positronium at @xmath48 . in this section",
    ", we discuss the polarization selection rules for splitting of both polarization modes irrespective of that the the initial state is a photon or a positronium atom .",
    "we consider the case when the initial state is below the threshold of free pair creation , @xmath49 .",
    "the splitting reactions that may be in principle in a superstrong magnetic field are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "at first we consider the kinematics of the splitting reaction @xmath58 where the initial and final states are the @xmath5 mode .",
    "we use the frame where @xmath59 for the initial state .",
    "if the energy of the initial state is @xmath60 this reaction is the photon splitting @xmath61 , while at @xmath62 it is the positronium annihilation @xmath63 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "below , both these processes are called splitting into photons .    the splitting reaction into two photons is kinematically allowed only if energy - momentum conservation can be satisfied :    @xmath64    in our case , when @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 .",
    "using equations ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) , we can solve the dispersion relation @xmath67 and find @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the frequency in the frame where @xmath22 is equal to zero .",
    "the function @xmath72 is equal to zero at @xmath73 and increases monotonously with increase of @xmath71 ( shabad & usov @xcite ) . from equations ( 2 )  -  ( 5 )",
    ", it follows that the deviation of @xmath68 from the vacuum dispersion curve @xmath74 to the side of large values of @xmath68 increases with increase of @xmath71 throughout the interval @xmath75 ( see fig.1 ) . in other words",
    ", we have @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for any values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "these properties of @xmath82 and equation ( 6 ) yield    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    therefore , the conservation of @xmath23 can not be satisfied for the splitting reaction @xmath86 below the threshold of free pair creation , and this reaction is kinematically forbidden .",
    "this is valid irrespective of that the initial state is either a photon or a positronium atom .",
    "the splitting reactions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath53 are also kinematically forbidden below the threshold of free pair creation . indeed , if we rewrite the dispersion relation @xmath44 for the @xmath4 mode in the form @xmath89 , the inequality @xmath90 holds throughout the interval @xmath91 ( shabad @xcite ; shabad & usov @xcite ) . using this inequality the chain of inequalities ( 7 )",
    "may be continued for splitting reactions when the initial state is the @xmath5 mode and at least one final state is the @xmath4 mode .",
    "finally , we have @xmath92 for all these reactions .",
    "hence , splitting of the @xmath5 mode is strictly forbidden below the threshold of free pair creation , i.e. , adler s conclusion remains unaffected by taking the resonant effects into consideration .    since the dispertion curve @xmath93 for the @xmath4 mode crosses the positronium spectra of the lowest series @xmath94 and @xmath95 without interfering with them , the resonant effects are unessential for splitting of the @xmath4 mode below the threshold of free pair creation , @xmath96 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in this case , the splitting reaction @xmath97 is kinematically forbidden while the splitting reactions @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are kinematically allowed ( adler @xcite ) .",
    "anyone can also come to this conclusion from the following properties of the functions @xmath101 and @xmath72 below the threshold of free pair creation , @xmath102 for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 ( shabad & usov @xcite ) .",
    "the splitting reactions @xmath99 and @xmath106 that involve an odd number of @xmath5-polarized photons are forbidden by cp invariance in the limit of zero dispersion ( adler @xcite ) . in the magnetized vacuum ,",
    "dispersive effects guarantee a nonzero probability for these reactions .",
    "therefore , the channels @xmath99 and @xmath106 are strongly suppressed in comparison with @xmath57 when the refraction index of the magnetized vacuum is close to unity , @xmath107 ( adler @xcite ) . however",
    ", this suppression may not hold in an extremely strong magnetic fields @xmath108  g ) .",
    "in this letter , we have discussed splitting of the principal modes that propagate in the vacuum polarized by a superstrong ( @xmath17 ) magnetic field . we have shown that splitting of the @xmath5 mode is strictly forbidden below the threshold of free pair creation .",
    "this is valid irrespective of that the initial state is either a photon ( @xmath109 ) or a positronium atom ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "splitting of the @xmath4 mode is allowed , and only the one channel ( @xmath111 ) of splitting operates if the magnetic field is not extremely high ( adler @xcite ) .        while we use the dispersion curves @xmath113 . from equation ( 8)",
    ", the properties of @xmath114 used by adler ( @xcite ) follow immediately from the properties of @xmath115 used in our study , and therefore , both these methods are equivalent .",
    "the fact that the resonant effects do not change the polarization selection rules found by adler for photon splitting in the limit of weak dispersion may be easily explained .",
    "indeed , to formulate the selection rules for the case when photons are significantly below the threshold of pair creation the following properties of functions @xmath72 and @xmath101 has been used , in fact , by adler ( @xcite ) , @xmath116 and for both principal modes the deviation of @xmath68 from the vacuum dispersion curve @xmath74 to the side of large values of @xmath68 increases with increase of @xmath117 .",
    "these properties only strengthen by the resonant effects , especially when the dispertion curve of the @xmath5 mode approaches the positronium state at @xmath118 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , for a positronium atom at the ground state ( @xmath119 ) with @xmath118 its stability against spontaneous decay into photons is evident , and it has been mentioned long ago ( herold et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the dispersion curves calculated in ( shabad & usov @xcite ) and used in this letter are exact relativistic consequences of the adiabatic approximation , and therefore , they are valid for an arbitrary strong magnetic field .",
    "[ this relates to equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . ]",
    "the nonrelativity is introduced only when the binding energy of the positronium ( 4 ) and the longitudinal wave function ( 5 ) that are the solutions of the nonrelativistic schr \" odinger equation are substituted into equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the relativistic corrections to both the binding energy and the longitudinal wave function are small if the positron and the electron remain nonrelativistic along the field direction , i.e. , if @xmath120 ( angelie & deutsch @xcite ; lai & salpeter @xcite ) . from equation ( 4 ) , it follows that the dispersion curves calculated in ( shabad & usov @xcite ) and therefore , our consideration are valid even if the magnetic field is as high as the virial magnetic field ( @xmath121 g ) for neutron stars .",
    "there is now compelling evidence for the existence of `` magnetars '' - neutron stars with magnetic field strenghths in excess of @xmath122 .",
    "the evidence comes primarily from observations of rapid spin down in the pulsations observed from soft @xmath2-ray repeaters ( e.g. , kouveliotou et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , radio surveys have discovered a few pulsars with the surface magnetic fields approaching @xmath123 ( camilo et al .",
    "kulkarni & frail ( @xcite ) and kouveliotou et al . ( @xcite ) estimate that the birthrate of magnetars is about 10% that of ordinary pulsars .",
    "the processes of photon splitting and bound pair creation may be very important for magnetars ( thompson & duncan @xcite ; usov & melrose @xcite ; baring & harding @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we briefly discuss these processes in the magnetospheres of pulsars with very strong magnetic fields .    for pulsars with the surface magnetic field",
    "@xmath124 g , @xmath4-polarized @xmath2-rays generated near the neutron star surface split into @xmath5-polarized @xmath2-rays before they reach the pair creation threshold ( e.g. , baring & harding @xcite ) . in turn , in such a strong magnetic field @xmath5-polarized @xmath2-rays create bound pairs which are stable , in the absence of such external factors as electric fields and ionizing radiation ( usov & melrose @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the bound pairs form a gas of electroneutral particles .",
    "such a gas does not undergo plasma processes , like plasma instabilities , which are responsible for the generation of coherent radio emission of pulsars .",
    "maybe , the suppression of free pair creation in superstrong magnetic fields results in a death line of pulsars at @xmath125 ( e.g. , baring & harding @xcite ; heyl & kulkarni @xcite ) . for this suppression",
    "it is very important that splitting of @xmath4-polarized @xmath2-rays into @xmath5-polarized @xmath2-rays prevents from formation of bound pairs at the state with @xmath126 when either the electron or the positron is in an excited state with the spin quantum number , @xmath127 , opposite to that in the ground state .",
    "otherwise , bound pairs in the excited state may be ionized by the recoil from photons radiated in a spin - flip transition , and free pairs may form in the magnetospheres of pulsars .    since bound pairs",
    "do not screen the electric field @xmath128 , the formation of bound rather than free pairs may cause increases in the height of the polar gap and the total power carried away by relativistic particles from the polar gap into the pulsar magnetosphere by large factors ( e.g. , shabad & usov @xcite ) . for the case",
    "when there is no emission of particles from the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star , these increases were considered by usov & melrose ( @xcite , @xcite ) in detail .",
    "recently , the polar gap model , which is rather close to reality for typical pulsars , is developed for the case when particles flow freely from the stellar surface ( muslimov & harding @xcite ; harding & muslimov @xcite ; zhang & harding @xcite ; hibschman & arons @xcite ) . in this model , the @xmath128 field in the polar gap is due to the effect of general relativistic frame dragging discovered by muslimov & tsygan ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the pulsar period @xmath129 s and @xmath130 , this field ( e.g. , harding & muslimov @xcite ) is significantly smaller that the value @xmath131 v  @xmath132 , at which filed ionization of bound pairs becomes important ( usov & melrose @xcite ) . the mean free path of bound pair photoionization is @xmath133 cm ( usov & melrose @xcite ) , where @xmath134 is the lorentz factor of bound pairs and @xmath135 is the surface temperature . for high - energy bound pairs ( @xmath136 ) that might be responsible for the @xmath128-field screening after their ionization , we have that @xmath137 is larger than the polar gap height even if @xmath135 is as high as @xmath138 k. therefore , the polar gap model developed in ( muslimov & harding @xcite ; harding & muslimov @xcite ; zhang & harding @xcite ; hibschman & arons @xcite ) is probably accurate for magnetic fields @xmath139 while for @xmath140 it is necessary to modify this model by taking into account photon splitting and bound pair creation .    in the vicinity of pulsars with @xmath124 g",
    "splitting of @xmath4-polarized @xmath2-rays into @xmath5-polarized @xmath2-rays provides a mechanism for the production of linearly polarized @xmath2-rays . at energies @xmath141 mev",
    ", the @xmath2-ray polarization may be up to 100% ( shabad & usov @xcite ) . by observing the polarization of the @xmath2-ray emission of pulsars it would be possible to estimate the magnetic field near the pulsar surface ."
