    "nonlinear optical elements inserted in optical cavities have been known for a long time to produce a great variety of interesting physical effects , taking advantage of the field enhancement effect and of the feedback provided by a resonant cavity @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to cavity - assisted nonlinear transverse effects , such as pattern formation @xcite and spatial soliton generation @xcite .",
    "more recently the quantum aspects of these phenomena have begun to be studied , mainly at the theoretical level , under the general name of `` quantum imaging '' , especially in planar or confocal cavities .",
    "almost all the investigations relative to intra - cavity nonlinear effects , both at the classical and quantum level , have been performed within the _ mean field approximation _ , in which one considers that the different interacting fields undergo only weak changes through their propagation inside the cavity , in terms of their longitudinal and transverse parameters .",
    "this almost universal approach simplifies a great deal the theoretical investigations , and numerical simulations are generally needed if one wants to go beyond this approximation @xcite .",
    "it implies in particular that diffraction is assumed to be negligible inside the nonlinear medium , which limits the applicability of the method to nonlinear media whose length @xmath0 is much smaller than the rayleigh length @xmath1 of the cavity modes @xmath2 ( so called `` thin '' medium ) .",
    "this is a configuration that experimentalists do not like much : they prefer to operate in the case @xmath3 which yields a much more efficient non linear interaction for a given pump power @xcite .",
    "if one wants to predict results of experiments in realistic situations , one therefore needs to extend the theory beyond the usual thin nonlinear medium approximation , and take into account diffraction effects occurring together with the nonlinear interaction inside the medium .",
    "the effects of simultaneous diffraction and nonlinear propagation have already been taken into account in the case of free propagation , i.e. without optical cavity around the nonlinear crystal , and they have been found to have a direct influence on the shape of the propagating beam @xcite .",
    "these effects have also been studied in detail at the quantum level in the parametric amplifier case @xcite , and recently for the soliton case @xcite .",
    "in contrast , they do not play a significant role when the nonlinear medium is inserted in an optical cavity with non degenerate transverse modes , which imposes the shape of the mode .",
    "but they are of paramount importance in the case of cavities having degenerate transverse modes , such as a plane or confocal cavity , which do not impose the transverse structure of the interacting fields , and which are used to generate multimode quantum effects .    within the thin crystal approximation , i.e. taking into account diffraction effects only outside the crystal , striking quantum properties have been predicted to occur in a degenerate opo below threshold using a confocal cavity @xcite : this device generates quadrature squeezed light which is multimode in the transverse domain .",
    "it was shown in the case of a plane pump that the level of squeezing measured at the output of such an opo neither depends on the spatial profile of the local oscillator used to probe it , nor on the size of the detection region .",
    "this implies that a significant quantum noise reduction , in principle tending to perfection when one approaches the oscillation threshold from below , can be observed in arbitrarily small portions of the down - converted beam .",
    "therefore in this model there is no limitation in the transverse size of the domains in which the quantum noise is reduced when the opo works in the exact confocal configuration .",
    "such a multimode squeezed light appears thereby as a very promising tool to increase the resolution in optical images beyond the wavelength limit .",
    "it is therefore very important to make a more realistic theoretical model of this system , which is no longer limited by the thin crystal approximation , to see whether the predicted local squeezing is still present in actual experimental realizations in which the crystal length is of the order of the rayleigh range of the resonator .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper , in which we will show that the presence of a long crystal inside the resonator imposes a lower limit to the size of the regions in which squeezing can be measured ( `` coherence area '' ) , which is proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cavity beam waist , @xmath6 is the crystal length and @xmath7 the rayleigh range of the resonator .",
    "the following section ( section ii ) is devoted to the general description of the model that is used to treat the effect of diffraction inside the crystal , using the assumption that the single pass nonlinear interaction is weak in the crystal .",
    "we then describe in section iii the method that is used to determine the squeezing spectra measured in well - defined homodyne detection schemes .",
    "we give in sections iv and v the results for such quantities respectively in the near field and in the far field , and conclude in section vi .",
    "let us consider a confocal cavity , that for simplicity we take as a ring cavity of the kind shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "it is formed by four plane mirrors and two lenses having a focal length equal to one quarter of the total cavity length , and symmetrically placed along the cavity , so that the focal points coincides at two positions c and c. it contains a type i parametric medium of length @xmath6 , centered on the point c ( see figure ) .",
    "it is pumped by a field @xmath8 of frequency @xmath9 having a gaussian shape and focused in the plane containing the point c. in such a plane the variation of the mean envelope with the transverse coordinate * x * is given by : @xmath10 we assume that the mirrors are totally transparent for the pump wave , and perfectly reflecting for the field at frequency @xmath11 , except for the coupling mirror @xmath12 , which has a small transmission @xmath13 at this frequency .",
    "the system was described in @xcite under the thin parametric medium approximation .",
    "we will follow here the same approach , generalized to the case of a thick parametric medium of length @xmath6 .",
    "the intracavity signal field at frequency @xmath11 is described by a field envelope operator @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the longitudinal coordinate along the cavity ( @xmath16 corresponding to plane c ) , obeying the standard equal time commutation relation at a given transverse plane at position @xmath15 : @xmath17=\\delta(\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{x ' } ) .\\ ] ] as we are only interested in the regime below threshold and without pump depletion , the pump field fluctuations do not play any role .    in a confocal resonator",
    "the cavity resonances corresponds to complete sets of gauss - laguerre modes with a given parity for transverse coordinate inversion ; we assume that a set of cavity _ even _ modes is tuned to resonance with the signal field , and that the odd modes are far off - resonance .",

    "this equation generalizes the thin medium parametric hamiltonian of ref.@xcite .      in previous approaches @xcite ,",

    "this can not be done in a thick crystal .",
    "we will nevertheless make a simplifying assumption which turns out to be very realistic in the c.w .",
    "regime , with pump powers below 1w .",
    "we assume that the nonlinear interaction is very weak , so that it does not affect much the field amplitudes in a single pass through the crystal .",

    "this assumption leads to a rather simple expression of the commutator for the @xmath26 field at different positions inside the crystal : @xmath31=   g_+^*(z - z ' ; \\textbf{x},\\textbf{x ' } ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the symmetrized part of the fresnel propagator @xmath33 , describing the field linear propagation inside the crystal : @xmath34\\ , .\\ ] ] with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the field wavenumber , with @xmath37 being the index of refraction at frequency @xmath11 , and we have introduced a walk - off term , present only if the signal wave is an extraordinary one , described by the two - dimensional walk - off angle @xmath38 .",
    "it is now possible to derive the time evolution of the field operator @xmath39 due to the parametric interaction .",
    "we will for example calculate it at the mid - point plane @xmath16 of the crystal : @xmath40 with the integral kernel @xmath41 given by : @xmath42 in the limit of a thin crystal considered in refs.@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ thick ] ) is replaced by the simpler expression : @xmath43 in the thin crystal case ( eq.([thin ] ) ) , the parametric interaction is local , i.e. the operators at different positions of the transverse plane are not coupled to each other , whereas in the thick crystal case ( eq.([thick ] ) ) , the parametric interaction mixes the operators at different points of the transverse plane , over areas of finite extension .",
    "note however that operators corresponding to different @xmath15 values are not coupled to each other , because of our assumption of weak parametric interaction .",
    "this situation is very close to the one considered in refs.@xcite for parametric down - conversion and amplification in a single - pass crystal , where finite transverse coherence areas for the spatial quantum effects arise because of the finite spatial emission bandwidth of the crystal . in a similar way , in our case",
    "the spatial extension of the kernel @xmath41 will turn out to give the minimum size in which spatial correlation or local squeezing can be observed in such a system .",
    "the analogy will become more evident in the next section , where we will explicitly solve the propagation equation of the fourier spatial modes along the crystal .    in order to get the complete evolution equation for the signal beam , one must add the free hamiltonian evolution of the intracavity beam and the damping effects .",
    "this part of the treatment is standard @xcite , and is identical to the case of a thin crystal inserted in a confocal cavity @xcite .",

    "one then gets : @xmath52 assuming for simplicity exact collinear phase matching @xmath53 , and neglecting the walk - off of the extraordinary wave , four of the five integrations can be exactly performed , and one finally gets : @xmath54 \\label{kint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 it can be easily shown that the function @xmath56 tends to the usual two - dimensional distribution @xmath57 when @xmath58 , and that it can be written in terms of the integral sine function @xmath59 @xcite @xmath60 this expression shows us that @xmath46 takes negligible values when @xmath61 .",

    "this expression shows that when the crystal length is on the order of the rayleigh range of the resonator , the transverse coherence length is on the order of the cavity waist .",
    "recalling that the pump field has a gaussian shape of waist @xmath66 , in order to have a multimode operation one must therefore use a defocussed pump , with @xmath67 , or alternatively use a crystal much shorter than the rayleigh range of the resonator , which is detrimental for the oscillation threshold of the opo .",
    "the relevant scaling parameter of our problem is therefore @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the rayleigh or diffraction length of the pump beam .",
    "this parameter sets the number of spatial modes that can be independently excited , and it will turn out to give also the number of modes that can be independently squeezed .      in this section",
    "we will investigate the intracavity dynamics of the spatial fourier amplitude of the signal field , which will offer an alternative formulation of the problem .",

    "the @xmath180 curve shows results obtained in the case of two small symmetrical pixels and a plane wave local oscillator as a function of the pixel distance from the cavity axis @xmath172 , scaled to @xmath176 .",
    "we can see that the noise level goes back to the shot noise level for @xmath179 , because to the non perfect phase matching along the crystal .",
    "when one takes into account the finite size of the pump , a coupling between different q vectors appear , and one needs to solve equations numerically , as in the near field case .",
    "a new coherence length @xmath143 appears in the far field : @xmath181 .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the evolution of the squeezing spectrum at zero frequency , and at resonance , for different b parameters , in function of the detector radius scaled to @xmath143 .",
    "we see the same evolution as in the analytical case , except that the noise level tends to shot noise for small values of the detector .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] shows the results obtained in the case of two symmetrical pixels ( pixel of size equal to the coherence length @xmath143 ) , for different b values , in function of the distance between the two pixels @xmath142 .",
    "the evolution is similar to the one given by fig(6 ) for large distances .",
    "but there is here also a decrease of the squeezing effect for small distances .",
    "we have seen that when one takes into account the effect of diffraction inside the nonlinear crystal in a confocal opo , the local squeezing predicted for any shape and size of the detectors in the thin crystal approximation is now restricted to detection areas lying within a given range , characterized by a coherence length @xmath135 .",
    "this prediction introduces serious limitations to the success of an experiment , and must be taken into account when designing the experimental set - up . with the purpose of producing a light beam that is squeezed in several elementary portions of its transverse cross - section , either a crystal short compared to @xmath7 should be used or , alternatively , a defocussed pump , with a waist much larger than the cavity waist . in both cases",
    "the efficiency of the non linear coupling is reduced .",
    "for instance , with @xmath182 long crystal , @xmath135 is equal to @xmath183 , and one must choose a pump waist much larger than this value in order to observe multimode squeezing ( the number of modes being roughly equal to the ratio @xmath184 ) .",
    "this defocussed pump will imply a much higher threshold for the opo oscillation , which is multiplied by a factor also close to @xmath185 .",
    "the conclusion of this analysis is that one can not have multimode squeezing `` for free '' , and that with a given pump power , one will be able to to excite a number of modes which is roughly equal to the ration of the injected pump power to the threshold power for single mode operation .",

    "<S> up to now , transverse quantum effects ( usually labelled as `` quantum imaging '' effects ) which are generated by nonlinear devices inserted in resonant optical cavities have been calculated using the `` thin crystal approximation '' , i.e. taking into account the effect of diffraction only inside the empty part of the cavity , and neglecting its effect in the nonlinear propagation inside the nonlinear crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce in the present paper a theoretical method which is not restricted by this approximation . it allows us in particular to treat configurations closer to the actual experimental ones , where the crystal length is comparable to the rayleigh length of the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> we use this method in the case of the confocal opo , where the thin crystal approximation predicts perfect squeezing on any area of the transverse plane , whatever its size and shape . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there exists in this case a `` coherence length '' which gives the minimum size of a detector on which perfect squeezing can be observed , and which gives therefore a limit to the improvement of optical resolution that can be obtained using such devices . </S>"
