    "in galactic dynamics , the identification of orbits as ordered ( i.e. periodic or quasiperiodic ) or chaotic and their respective role in the structure of galaxies has been studied extensively for many years ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "distinguishing between quasiperiodic and chaotic motion , in general , poses no major difficulty , as there are many numerical approaches presently available by which this distinction can be easily accomplished .",
    "what is considerably more complicated is the identification of _ weakly _ chaotic orbits , particularly when integration times are not long enough .",
    "weak chaos is manifested , for example , in trajectories that `` stick '' for long times on the boundaries of `` islands '' of ordered motion , where the maximal lyapunov exponent ( mle ) is positive but `` small '' , before eventually occupying a wider domain of strong chaos with much larger mles .",
    "weakly chaotic orbits spend a significant fraction of their time in confined regimes and do not fill up phase space as `` homogeneously '' as strongly chaotic trajectories , which explore faster and more uniformly their available regions .",
    "several researchers have demonstrated the importance of weakly chaotic phenomena in supporting barred or spiral galaxy features ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are also several results in the recent literature showing that strong local instability does not necessarily imply widespread diffusion in phase space @xcite . in @xcite `` stickiness '' was studied thoroughly in 2 degrees of freedom ( dof ) and was categorized in two main types : ( a ) `` stickiness '' around an island of stability and ( b ) `` stickiness '' in chaos , along the invariant manifolds of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "the role of `` sticky '' chaotic orbits and the diffusive behavior in the neighborhood of invariant tori surrounding periodic solutions of the hamiltonian was studied in @xcite .",
    "the challenging problem , however , is to be able to _ detect _ weak chaos ( as manifested e.g. in `` stickiness '' phenomena ) , for _ short _ integration times ( not exceeding the age of the universe ) , before the true character of the dynamics becomes apparent .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a novel approach for tackling this problem based on the _ statistics _ of the orbits of certain barred galaxy models .",
    "in particular , we consider probability density functions ( pdfs ) of _ sums _ of their variables , in the spirit of the central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "if these pdfs quickly tend to gaussians , we classify the orbits as strongly chaotic and suggest that their motion is characterized boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics .",
    "if , on the other hand , the pdfs are well approximated by @xmath0gaussian functions , we characterize the orbits as weakly chaotic , implying that they form quasi - stationary states that obey the principles of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite    pdfs of chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems have long been studied by many authors , aiming to understand the transition from deterministic to stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main question here concerns the existence of an appropriate invariant probability measure , characterizing chaotic phase space regions where solutions generically exhibit exponential divergence of nearby trajectories .",
    "if this invariant measure turns out to be a continuous and sufficiently smooth function of the phase space coordinates , one can invoke the boltzmann - gibbs microcanonical ensemble and attempt to evaluate all relevant quantities of equilibrium statistical mechanics , like partition function , free energy , entropy , etc . of the system .",
    "in such cases , viewing the values of one ( or a linear combination ) of components of a chaotic solution at discrete times @xmath3 as realizations of @xmath4 independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables @xmath5 and calculating the distribution of their sums , one expects to find a gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance as the @xmath5 s ( according to the central limit theorem ) .",
    "this is indeed what happens for many chaotic dynamical systems studied to date which are _ ergodic _ , i.e. almost all their orbits ( except for a set of measure zero ) pass arbitrarily close to any point of the constant energy manifold , after sufficiently long enough times . in these cases ,",
    "at least one of the lyapunov exponents @xcite is positive , stable periodic orbits are absent and the constant energy manifold is covered uniformly by chaotic orbits , for all but a ( lebesgue ) measure zero set of initial conditions .    in the galactic models treated in this paper , we focus on weakly chaotic regimes and demonstrate by means of numerical experiments that pdfs of sums of their variables _",
    "do not _ rapidly converge to a gaussian , but are well approximated , for long integration times , by the so - called @xmath0-gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\nonumber\\ ] ] where the index @xmath0 satisfies @xmath1 , @xmath7 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath8 is a normalization constant . at longer times , of course , chaotic orbits eventually `` seep out '' from small regions to larger chaotic seas , where obstruction by islands and cantori is less dominant and the dynamics is more uniformly ergodic .",
    "this transition is signaled by the @xmath0-index of the distribution ( [ q_gaussian ] ) decreasing towards @xmath2 , which represents the limit at which the pdfs become gaussian .    in what follows , we begin in section [ model_gal ] by presenting our galaxy barred galaxy model with all its components and parameters . in section [ clt_approach ] ,",
    "we describe the approach of the @xmath0-gaussian distributions and discuss the details of their computation .",
    "sections [ 2dof_distr ] , [ 3dof_distr ] are devoted to the application of these pdfs and the demonstration of their effectiveness in distinguishing between strong and weak chaos in 2 and 3 dof cases of the galactic potential , using also power spectra to support our findings .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider the motion of test particles in a rotating `` mean field '' model of a barred galaxy potential @xmath9 governed by the 3 dof hamiltonian @xmath10 the bar rotates around its @xmath11-axis ( the short axis ) , while the @xmath12-direction rotates along the major axis and the @xmath13 along the intermediate axis of the bar .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the canonically conjugate momenta , @xmath16 represents the pattern speed of the bar and @xmath17 is the total constant energy of the orbit in the rotating frame of reference ( namely the jacobi integral ) . the corresponding equations of motion are    [ eq_motion ] & = p_x + _ b y , & & = p_y - _ bx , & & = p_z , & + & = - + _ b p_y , & & = - - _ b p_x , & & = - . &    the potential consists of three components",
    "@xmath18 :    1 .   the disc , which is represented by a miyamoto - nagai disc @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total mass of the disc , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are its horizontal and vertical scale - lengths , and @xmath23 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the bulge , which is modeled by a plummer sphere @xcite whose potential is : @xmath24 @xmath25 is the scale - length of the bulge and @xmath26 is its total mass .",
    "the triaxial ferrers bar @xcite , the density @xmath27 of which is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the central density , @xmath30 is the total mass of the bar and @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the semi - axes .",
    "the corresponding potential is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 is a positive integer ( with @xmath38 for our model ) and @xmath39 is the unique positive solution of @xmath40 outside of the bar ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 inside the bar .",
    "the corresponding forces are given analytically in @xcite .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the following parameters : @xmath23=1 , @xmath16=0.054 ( 54 @xmath43 ) , @xmath8=6 , @xmath441.5 , @xmath33=0.6 , @xmath21=3 , @xmath22=1 , @xmath25=0.4 , @xmath30=0.1 , @xmath26=0.08 , @xmath20=0.82 , both for the 2 and 3 dof versions .",
    "the units used are : 1 @xmath45 ( length ) , 1000 @xmath46 ( velocity ) , 1 @xmath47 ( time ) , @xmath48 ( mass ) .",
    "the total mass @xmath49 is set equal to 1 and the corotation radius is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the above model was used extensively in orbital studies @xcite , in which the stability of its main periodic orbits was thoroughly investigated , as several of its parameters were varied . in @xcite , a dynamical study of regular ,",
    "chaotic and weakly chaotic motion was presented ( both in phase and configuration space ) for different distributions of initial conditions and values of the parameters of the bar . moreover , the sali / gali method @xcite and frequency spectrum analysis were applied to discriminate between strongly and weakly chaotic orbits in @xcite .",
    "the latter are of great importance from an astronomical point of view , since they can last for long time scales and behave quite `` regularly '' before revealing their inherent chaotic nature .    in our study ,",
    "the maximal integration of the orbits is typically set to @xmath51 ( 10 billion years ) , which corresponds to a time less than ( but of the order of ) one hubble time .",
    "nevertheless , we often extend our simulations to longer times to study the dynamics of our solutions in greater detail .",
    "the approach we shall adopt is in the spirit of the central limit theorem : using the solutions of the equations of motion ( [ eq_motion ] ) we construct probability density functions ( pdfs ) of suitably rescaled sums of an observable function @xmath52 , which depends linearly on the position coordinates of the solution and is calculated at the ends of @xmath53 successive time intervals @xmath54 .",
    "if the motion is chaotic and @xmath55 is relatively `` large '' , the @xmath56 can be assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables ( in the large @xmath53 limit ) .",
    "thus , evaluating their sum @xmath57 for @xmath58 initial conditions , we can study the statistics of these variables centered about their mean value @xmath59 and rescaled by their standard deviation @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 plotting the normalized histogram of the probabilities @xmath63 as a function of @xmath64 , we approximate the resulting pdfs by @xmath0-gaussian functions of the form @xmath65^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the so - called entropic index , @xmath7 is a free parameter and @xmath8 a normalization constant @xcite .",
    "if the motion is strongly chaotic , the pdfs are expected to converge to the well - known gaussian , which represents the limit of ( [ q_gaussian ] ) as @xmath66 . however , in regimes of weak chaos it has been found in many studies that the orbits form quasi - stationary states , which can be very long - lived and whose pdfs are well - fitted by @xmath0-gaussian functions with @xmath0 well above unity @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that ( [ q_gaussian ] ) is normalized by setting @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the euler gamma function ) , implying that the allowed values of @xmath0 are @xmath1 .",
    "the index @xmath0 is connected with the tsallis entropy @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 counts the microstates of the system , each occurring with a probability @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the so - called boltzmann universal constant . just as the gaussian distribution represents an extremal of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath73 , so is the @xmath0-gaussian ( [ q_gaussian ] ) derived by optimizing the tsallis entropy ( [ tsallis entropy ] ) under appropriate constraints .",
    "systems characterized by the tsallis entropy occur very frequently in a variety of applications and obey statistics different than boltzmann - gibbs , in the sense that their entropy is nonadditive and generally nonextensive @xcite .",
    "examples falling in this class are physical systems governed by long range forces , like self - gravitating systems of finitely many mass points , interacting black holes and ferromagnetic spin models , in which correlations decay by power laws rather than exponentially @xcite .",
    "let us now describe the numerical approach we follow to calculate the above pdfs .",
    "first we select @xmath74 as one ( or a linear combination ) of the position coordinates @xmath75 of an orbit which we wish to identify as strongly or weakly chaotic .",
    "choosing then an integration interval @xmath76 sufficiently long to obtain reliable statistics , we divide @xmath77 into @xmath78 equally spaced , consecutive time windows , which are long enough to contain a significant part of the orbit .",
    "next , we subdivide each such window into a number @xmath53 of equally spaced subintervals and calculate the sums ( [ sums_clt ] ) at the ends of these subintervals as described above .    in this way",
    ", we treat the point at the beginning of every time window as a new initial condition and repeat this process @xmath78 times to obtain as many sums as possible for the time interval @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , at the end of the integration , we evaluate the @xmath78 rescaled quantities @xmath64 ( [ s_m_j variables ] ) and plot the histogram @xmath63 of their distribution .",
    "if we are in a regime where these distributions are well - fitted by @xmath0-gaussians for fairly long times , the orbit can be classified as weakly chaotic .",
    "if , on the other hand , the orbit is strongly chaotic , its pdf is seen to approach a gaussian , already for relatively short time intervals not exceeding , in our case , the age of the universe .",
    "let us start by analyzing the 2 dof version of our galactic model ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) , setting @xmath79 initially , whence @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in identifying the dynamical behavior of the following two orbits :    * the 2-dimensional strongly chaotic ( 2dsc ) orbit , with initial condition + @xmath82 and @xmath83 , + and * the 2-dimensional weakly chaotic ( 2dwc ) orbit , with initial condition + @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    these orbits for the 2 dof case ( and the next two of section 5 for the 3 dof case ) are selected from a vast number of trajectories ( see [ 24 , 27 ] ) , as representative examples of weakly and strongly chaotic motion to which we can apply our pdf approach and link the results with questions of interest to dynamical astronomy .",
    "the authors in [ 24 , 27 ] used dynamical chaos detectors on thousands of orbits , in order to investigate and chart the fractions of chaotic and regular regimes of the phase space and then link these fractions to the main parameters of the bar component .",
    "since it was evident from these studies that there is a significant amount of weakly chaotic orbits that appear `` regular '' for astronomically bounded time scales , we decided to revisit this question in the present paper from a statistical point of view .",

[ fig6 ] , we present the time evolution of the mle of the strongly chaotic orbit 3dsc , which does appear to converge rather rapidly to the value @xmath127 ( solid curve ) . in the case of the weakly chaotic orbit 3dwc , we observe a much slower convergence as the mle `` dives '' to small values @xmath128 ( dashed curve ) at about @xmath129 , indicating a weaker form of chaos over this interval and only rises to higher values corresponding to strong chaos for longer times .",
    "in fact , in the time interval @xmath130 , the 3dwc orbit does display some quasiperiodic features ( see also figs  [ fig2](a),(b ) ) , which will be discussed below , when we study amplitude spectra of the 3dwc orbit .",
    "intrigued by the above results , we decided to investigate separately the projections of the 3dwc orbit on the @xmath111 plane and the @xmath11 axis , for longer integration times .",

    "this is also evident by the fact that the mle of the orbit ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) decreases on the average to fairly low values over this interval .",
    "a statistically reliable fit is possible only after about @xmath138 , yielding @xmath131 values well above 2 with a trend to approach @xmath2 at longer times ( see fig .",

    "it would be interesting , therefore , to apply the statistical methods described in this paper to different galaxy structures to quantify their chaotic regimes in more detail and obtain a more complete picture of their dynamics .",

    "<S> we use probability density functions ( pdfs ) of sums of orbit coordinates , over time intervals of the order of one hubble time , to distinguish weakly from strongly chaotic orbits in a barred galaxy model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the weakly chaotic case , quasi - stationary states arise , whose pdfs are well approximated by @xmath0-gaussian functions ( with @xmath1 ) , while strong chaos is identified by pdfs which quickly tend to gaussians ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples of weakly chaotic orbits are those that `` stick '' to islands of ordered motion . their presence in rotating galaxy models has been investigated thoroughly in recent years due of their ability to support galaxy structures for relatively long time scales . in this paper , we demonstrate , on specific orbits of 2 and 3 degree of freedom barred galaxy models , that the proposed statistical approach can distinguish weakly from strongly chaotic motion accurately and efficiently , especially in cases where lyapunov exponents and other local dynamic indicators appear to be inconclusive . </S>"
