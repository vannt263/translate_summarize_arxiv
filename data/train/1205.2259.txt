    "an atlas of o - g0 stars in the infrared spectral region was presented by andrillat et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but no systematic attempt has been undertaken so far to investigate the spectra of be stars in the rvs domain of gaia .",
    "therefore , we decided to carry out a large scale documentation project on be stars . a very brief description of the ca  ii ir lines in",
    "be stars can be found in jaschek et al .",
    "the aim of the project was to compare h@xmath0 and paschen spectra of be stars and exploit the possibility to derive the properties of h@xmath0 from the observations of higher members of the paschen series , as gaia instrumentation will complement the medium resolution ir spectra by very poor spectral resolution for h@xmath0 line .",
    "in addition , one can study the behaviour of the calcium triplet in early - type emission stars and interacting binaries .",
    "for the survey , we used the ondejov 2-m telescope equipped with a coud spectrograph .",
    "pairs of spectra covering h@xmath0 and gaia rvs region have been so far obtained for about 150 be stars .",
    "the spectra were secured with the ondejov single order spectrograph + site 2000x800 chip ( r=12700 , 6250 - 6750 and 8392 - 8900  ) .",
    "the stellar and calibration spectra ( th - ar and tungsten lamps ) were reduced using iraf .",
    "* calcium triplet emission in interacting binary be stars . *",
    "the ca ii triplet lines coincide with paschen p16 , 15 , and 13 . for a strong emission object like @xmath1 oph",
    ", the contribution of calcium to the paschen emission is marginal , if any ( no difference in intensity between p14 and p15/p16 ) .",
    "however , in  normal \" be stars ( e.g. v731  tau or @xmath2  cas ) the calcium emission is growing with the decreasing strength of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "it is very pronounced in interacting binaries ax  mon , kx  and , br  cmi , but not visible in systems like rx  cas , cx  dra or even @xmath3 lyr .",

    "its red and infrared spectrum closely resembles br  cmi , an interacting be binary ( royer et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "we derived the first orbital elements : @xmath7=@xmath6 , @xmath8=79 km  s@xmath9 , @xmath10=0 .",
    "trailed spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the orbital period applied on hipparcos photometric data gives double - wave curve , while the 25.7-day period suggested by koen and eyer ( 2002 ) yields simple curve .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the secondary ( cool ) star is based on the measurements of fe i and ca ii absorption lines . as in case of br  cmi",
    ", the lines of primary component are not readily seen .",
    "the estimated semi - amplitude of the primary ( hot ) star is in the range of 515 km  s@xmath9 ( from the motion of h@xmath0 and ca ii emission ) .    _",
