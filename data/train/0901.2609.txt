    "we have now compelling evidences for the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) in the universe , whose mass density has been accurately measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite . the dm mass density normalized by the critical density",
    "is given by , in the @xmath0 range , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the scaled hubble constant in the units of 100 ( km / sec)/mpc .",
    "recently , the dama collaboration has reported the observation of an annual modulation @xcite in nuclear recoil rate of nai(tl ) detectors @xcite .",
    "the dama signal is consistent with elastic , spin independent dm scattering from target nuclei in the detectors .",
    "the conventional signal region corresponds to the dm mass and the scattering cross section @xmath3 , which is now excluded by other dm search experiments such as xenon10 @xcite and cdms ( ge ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , however , that considering effect of channeling @xcite in the nai crystal scintillators of dama , the spin - independent elastic scattering of dm with nuclei can accommodate the dama signal with the results of other null experiments .",
    "the corresponding region of the cross section , which might be compatible with all experiments ( even without considering dark stream @xcite ) , is given by @xcite @xmath4 with a dm mass in the range of @xmath5    various models have been studied to accommodate the dama signal region with the parameters of ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ mass ] ) , which include mirror dark matter @xcite , wimpless dark matter @xcite , light neutralino in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite and right - handed sneutrino dark matter from next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "adding to those models , there are other good approaches explaining the dama modulation signals as massive wimps ( heavier than 100 gev ) free from null experimental bounds , which focus on inelastic dark matter with non - standard halo models of dm velocity distribution or various galactic escape velocities @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we would like to direct a spotlight on a singlet fermionic dark matter @xcite elastically scattering from target nuclei with ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ mass ] ) to explain the dama signal reconciling other null experiments , which can also simultaneously satisfy the measured dm mass density @xmath6 .",
    "our paper is organized as following . in section [ sec : model ] , we briefly review the model of singlet fermionic dark matter .",
    "for other recent studies of singlet .",
    "model parameter regions , which explain the dama signal in the low mass region with the correct thermal relic density , are investigated in section [ sec : na ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "a standard model ( sm ) gauge singlet sector , aka `` hidden sector '' , is introduced , which consists of a real scalar field @xmath7 and a dirac fermion field @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the singlet scalar @xmath7 couples to the sm particles only through the interactions with the sm higgs boson .",
    "the interaction of the singlet dm fermion @xmath8 with the sm particles comes through the interaction of @xmath8 with the singlet scalar @xmath7 and the mixing of the scalar @xmath7 with the sm higgs .",
    "the model lagrangian is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the sm lagrangian and the hidden sector lagrangian is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 the interaction terms between the singlet scalar @xmath7 and the sm higgs @xmath13 are given by @xmath14    the scalar potential given in eq.([eq : ps0 ] ) and ( [ eq : int ] ) , together with the sm higgs potential @xmath15 derives vacuum expectation values , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , of the neutral component of the sm higgs and the singlet scalar , respectively .",
    "the extremum conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , of total scalar potential @xmath20 , lead to the following relations among the model parameters @xcite @xmath21    the neutral scalar fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 are mixed to yield the mass matrix given by @xmath26 the corresponding mass eigenstates @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined by @xmath29 where the mixing angle @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 . then the two higgs boson masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath36 . from the above definition of the mixing angle @xmath30 , we get @xmath37 , hence @xmath27 is sm higgs - like while @xmath28 is singlet - like .    in total , we have eight independent model parameters relevant for dm phenomenology",
    ". the six model parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 determine the masses , mixing and self - couplings of the scalar sector .",
    "the singlet fermion @xmath8 has mass @xmath40 as an independent parameter of the model since @xmath41 is just a free model parameter .",
    "finally , the yukawa coupling @xmath42 measures the interaction of @xmath8 with singlet component of the scalar particles .",
    "0.4 cm    spin - independent elastic scattering of the fermionic dm @xmath8 with nucleons arises from @xmath43channel higgs exchange diagrams , which is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : scattering ] . for a light dark matter with @xmath44 gev ,",
    "the spin - independent cross section for dm - proton scattering is approximately given by @xmath45 assuming @xmath46 . with @xmath47 ,",
    "a low higgs mass @xmath48 is needed in order to obtain a desired value of @xmath49 pb for explaining the dama result . on the other hand the scalar mixing angle @xmath50 , which determines @xmath51 coupling , should be small not to conflict with the lep constraint on the higgs mass @xcite , for such a low higgs mass .",
    "for instance , @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 with @xmath54 provides the dama favored value for the scattering cross section while satisfying the lep constraint on the higgs mass .",
    "one concern about the light fermionic dm scenario for explaining the dama data is that it usually leads to too large thermal dm relic density to be compatible with the wmap measurement ( [ wmap ] ) , if dm pair annihilation undergoes mainly through s - channel higgs exchanges @xcite .",
    "however , when the singlet - like higgs mass is less than or similar to the dm particle mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath55 , the dominant contribution for the annihilation of dm pair in the early universe arises from @xmath56 process , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation ] . in this kinematic regime ,",
    "the singlet - like higgs does not decay into the dm pair since it is not kinematically allowed , but it decays entirely into the sm particles .",
    "the dm pair annihilation to @xmath28 pair is not suppressed by the small mixing angle @xmath30 because @xmath57 coupling is proportional to @xmath58 rather than @xmath50 , thus it may provide large enough annihilation cross - section to have a small dm relic density compatible with the wmap data @xcite .",
    "0.4 cm    as a specific numerical example , let us consider the following model parameters @xmath59 which provide the masses and mixing angle of two higgs particles as @xmath60 further setting @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we obtain the following spin - independent dm scattering cross section and thermal dm relic density ; @xmath63 which would explain the dama signals without conflicting other null experiments , and also satisfy the measured dm mass density simultaneously .",
    "we also note that the lifetime of the singlet - like higgs @xmath28 is much shorter than one second .",
    "thus it decays well before the start of the big bang nucleosynthesis , making no cosmological problem .",
    "now we scan our model parameters in a certain region , which provides a low singlet - like higgs mass ( 1 gev @xmath64 gev ) , @xmath65 gev and small scalar mixing angle ( @xmath66 ) within a low dm mass range ( 1 gev @xmath67 gev ) .",
    "[ fig : scan ] is the result of the parameter scan , showing the spin - independent cross section for dm - nucleon scattering as a function of the singlet fermionic dm mass @xmath68 . in the figure ,",
    "the red points are the predictions for the scattering cross section of singlet fermionic dm and they are required to satisfy the measured dm mass density ( [ wmap ] ) .",
    "the cyan regions are consistent with the dama signals . also denoted are the upper limits from various other null experiments .",
    "we clearly see that the singlet fermionic dm can explain the dama signals without conflicting with other null experiments and simultaneously satisfy the dm mass density which is consistent with the wmap data .",
    "we have shown that a simple model of light singlet fermionic dark matter can reconcile the dama signal with other null experiments , while providing a right amount of dm mass density which is consistent with the wmap observation .",
    "the t - channel pair annihilation of the light dark matters to the pair of light singlet higgs particles , with subsequent higgs decays to the sm particles , would provide a large enough annihilation cross section to have a right amount of dm relic density .",
    "the light singlet fermionic dm , with the light singlet - like higgs , can provide the spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering cross section which is compatible with the dama signal region and other null experiments , simultaneously .",
