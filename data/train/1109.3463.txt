    "it is well established that the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux ( `` uv - upturn '' ) observed in the nearby quiescent early - type galaxies ( etgs ) originates from a minority population of hot horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars and their progeny . recently",
    ", a significant progress has been made as to the origin of these hot hb stars in old stellar systems .",
    "this new theory is based on the recent observations and modeling of globular clusters ( gcs ) with extended hb , such as @xmath1  cen and ngc 2808 , where the multiple main - sequences and hot hbs in these clusters can only be explained by the presence of super helium - rich subpopulations @xcite .",
    "the origin of this helium enhancement is most likely due to the pollution from the intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch stars and/or fast - rotating massive stars , or due to the enrichment by supernovae .",
    "therefore , the likely presence of super - helium - rich subpopulations and the resulting hot hb stars in old stellar systems deserve further investigation , as they could be a major source of the fuv flux in quiescent elliptical galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to report our first result on the uv upturn phenomenon predicted from the yonsei evolutionary population synthesis models with helium - enhanced subpopulations .",
    "the models presented in this paper were constructed using the yonsei evolutionary population synthesis ( yeps ) code .",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite , @xcite , and chung et al .",
    "( 2011 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) for the details of model construction . in order to investigate the effect of helium - enhanced stellar population on the uv - upturn",
    ", we have used the most up - to - date yonsei - yale ( @xmath2 ) stellar isochrones and hb evolutionary tracks ( han et al .",
    "2011 , _ in prep . _ ) with different values of helium abundance ( @xmath3 , 0.33 , and 0.38 ) .",
    "we apply the same mass - loss parameter ( @xmath4 ) and the enhancement in @xmath5-elements ( @xmath6 $ ] ) for both helium - enhanced and normal helium populations ( see table 1 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows an example of our model hr diagrams and corresponding spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of simple stellar population ( ssp ) for normal helium and helium - enhanced populations . since helium - rich stars evolve faster than helium - poor stars , helium - rich stars have lower masses at given age .",
    "this effect has a striking difference on the hb stage ( see left panels ) .",
    "the mean temperature of hb stars in helium - enhanced ( @xmath7 ) population is @xmath8  11,500  k greater than that of the normal helium ( @xmath9 ) population at a given metallicity ( @xmath10=-0.9 $ ] ) and age ( 11  gyr ) .",
    "consequently , the helium - enhanced models show extremely strong far - uv flux compared to the normal helium models .    in order to include this effect of the helium - enhanced population into the composite sed for a model elliptical galaxy ,",
    "we have employed following procedures in the model construction .",
    "first , helium abundances of helium - enhanced subpopulations were chosen to be @xmath11 and 0.38 , as these values are roughly required to reproduce the extreme blue hb stars observed in the milky way gcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; joo & lee 2011 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) . in our modeling ,",
    "populations having these two helium abundances were mixed half and half .",
    "second , we have used mean @xmath0 colors of uv - strong gcs in m87 @xcite to set the fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulations at given metallicity ( see figure  2a ) . figure",
    "2b shows the fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulations as a function of metallicity , which was adopted in our model with helium - enhanced subpopulations to reproduce the observed trend of @xmath0 color with metallicity in m87 gcs .",
    "figure  2c displays the contribution of helium - enhanced subpopulations in the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) used in our construction of the composite stellar population model for giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "this mdf was adopted from the simple chemical evolution model of .    according to the list of @xcite ,",
    "about 30% of the milky way gcs have extended hb , each of which contains about 30% of helium - enhanced subpopulation @xcite , so about 9% of stellar population in the milky way gcs are assumed to be helium - enhanced population . in our composite model for giant elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the number fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulations is about @xmath8 11% , which agrees roughly with that estimated in the milky way gcs .",
    "this fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulations is reduced to @xmath8  6.4% when only hot enough ( @xmath12  k ) blue hb stars are counted , which are actually responsible for the far - uv flux in our model giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "=  7.3 in ab magnitude system ) , all of the hb population is predicted to be cooler than 20,000  k. @xcite found from their hst / stis photometry of m32 that stars passing through the hb at @xmath13  k comprise only a small fraction ( about 7% ) of the total hb population .",
    "this fraction is roughly consistent with that ( @xmath8  5.5% ) predicted from our models for m32 . ]",
    "figure  3 presents our composite models constructed with and without helium - enhanced subpopulations compared with the seds observed by _ iue _ satellite for two giant elliptical galaxies ngc  4552 and ngc  4649 . in our models , the value of mean metallicity ( @xmath14\\right>$ ] )",
    "was chosen so that they can reproduce the observed mg  _ b _",
    "( @xmath15  4.6   ) index of theses galaxies ( see also figure  4 ) , assuming that @xmath6 $ ] is 0.3 in giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the parameters adopted in our models presented in figure  3 are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is clear from figure  3 that our models with helium - enhanced subpopulations can naturally reproduce not only the strong far - uv upturns but also the 2500   dips observed in ngc  4552 and ngc  4649 , while the models without helium - enhanced subpopulations fail to reproduce the far - uv upturns , unless the age of underlying stellar population is increased to @xmath8  16  gyrs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the minority population ( @xmath8  6.4% ) of helium - enhanced hot hb stars and their progeny is responsible for the observed far - uv flux in this scenario./ca ii k index .",
    "the ca ii h + h@xmath16/ca ii k index of our model for giant elliptical galaxy ( presented in figure 3 ) is 1.15 , which is consistent with the observation ( @xmath8  1.16 ; @xcite ) to within the error ( @xmath17  0.03 ) . ]",
    "our composite models with helium - enhanced subpopulations predict that about 85% of the far - uv flux comes from the metal - poor side ( @xmath10 \\leq 0.0 $ ] ) of the mdf . in this regard ,",
    "this model is qualitatively similar to the `` metal - poor hb model '' of @xcite , but it does not need to invoke unrealistically old ages ( @xmath8  16  gyr ) as in the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "our composite models with helium - enhanced subpopulations can reproduce the uv - upturn at the mean age of 11  gyrs , in the age scale where the inner halo gcs of the milky way is 12  gyrs old .",
    "if the age of the oldest gcs in the milky way is more like 13  gyrs @xcite , our age for the giant elliptical galaxies would also increase by 1  gyr .",
    "these ages for giant elliptical galaxies ( 11  -  12  gyrs ) are consistent with the value estimated from the balmer line indices to within the error @xcite .    in figure  4 , we have plotted the mg  @xmath18 line strength against @xmath0 color for the sample of quiescent etgs from @xcite .",
    "superposed grids are our composite models with ( blue ) and without ( red ) helium - enhanced subpopulations.=0.3 $ ] , while some galaxies in figure  4 have lower values of @xmath6 $ ] . if @xmath6=0.1 $ ] , the @xmath0 color gets redder by small amount ( @xmath8  0.1 ) , while the mg  @xmath18 index is more affected ( decreases by @xmath8  0.4   ) .",
    "therefore , the model grids in figure 4 shift mostly downwards as @xmath6 $ ] decreases , and this should have only little effect on the predicted age spread among sample galaxies . ] the observed etgs show clear correlation between @xmath0 and mg  @xmath18 that is analogous to the @xcite relation .",
    "our composite models predict that the strength of uv - upturn is controlled by the fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulation , the mean age , and the mean metallicity of underlying stellar population . among these three factors",
    ", the fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulation appears to be the most effective factor determining the strength of uv - upturn .",
    "for example , our 11  gyr models with and without helium - enhanced subpopulations would explain most of the color spread in @xmath0 .",
    "if all etgs in this sample , however , contain similar fraction of helium - enhanced subpopulations , an age spread spanning @xmath8  6  gyrs would be required to reproduce the observed spread in @xmath0 color , in the sense that bluer galaxies are older .",
    "this is because the mean temperature of hb stars decreases as the age of stellar population gets younger ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an age spread of this magnitude is also indicated from the balmer line dating of etgs @xcite , which suggests that some age spread is indeed responsible for the spread in @xmath0 color .",
    "the observed fading of fuv flux with look - back time for the bright cluster elliptical galaxies in @xmath19 @xcite also supports this possibility .",
    "note from figure  4 that our models both with and without helium - enhanced subpopulations predict fading of fuv flux with increasing look - back time .",
    "we have demonstrated that the presence of relatively metal - poor and helium - enhanced subpopulations in etgs can naturally reproduce the observed uv - upturn phenomenon , without invoking unrealistically old ages .",
    "although the presence of helium - enriched stars appears to solve many of the problems associated with the uv - upturn phenomenon , it is important to note that the origin of this helium enhancement is not fully understood yet .",
    "consequently , it is not clear yet whether the proposed mechanisms to produce helium - enhanced stars in gcs will also be important in the galactic scales .",
    "nevertheless , several lines of evidence do suggest that a minority population of helium - enhanced stars would be present also in etgs .",
    "first , the two well defined remaining local building blocks in the milky way , the @xmath1  cen and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( including m54 ) , are all characterized by very extended hb with helium - enhanced extreme blue hb stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; joo & lee 2011 , _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "second , the orbital kinematics of milky way gcs with extended hb , which is indicating the presence of helium - enhanced subpopulation , are distinct from normal gcs , and are fully consistent with the hypothesis that they are the remaining relics of the early building blocks predicted in the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "finally , as discussed above , when the observed trend of @xmath0 color with metallicity for the uv - strong gcs ( presumably with the extended hb ) in the giant elliptical galaxy m87 is combined with the expected mdf of a model giant elliptical galaxy , the @xmath0 color similar to that observed in giant elliptical galaxies is reproduced .",
    "this is again consistent with the building block origin for these gcs , according to which the helium - enhanced subpopulations in etgs would have been supplied by these early galaxy building blocks .",
    "if normal etgs are prevailed by helium - enhanced populations , as suggested in this letter , they would have impacts not only on uv , but also on other wavelength regime affected by relatively hot blue hb stars , such as balmer absorption lines @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "it is important to note that @xcite found that their models ( without helium - enhanced subpopulation ) of passive evolution can not reproduce the unexpectedly strong balmer line indices of etgs at @xmath20 and @xmath21 . it would be interesting to see how our models with helium - enhanced subpopulations are matched with these observations .",
    "the well known discrepancy between the h@xmath22 and higher order balmer lines ( `` balmer mismatch '' ; @xcite ) is also an important issue , for which the helium - enhanced populations could play a role . our forthcoming paper ( chung et al .",
    "2011 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) will discuss these issues in more detail , together with their connection with the uv - upturn phenomenon .",
