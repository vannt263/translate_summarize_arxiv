    "<S> the average @xmath0 of the scattering matrix , called optical @xmath1 matrix in the nuclear physics jargon , is obtained analytically for the first time . to do this a family @xmath2 of scattering systems </S>",

    "<S> element @xmath3 of the family yields the scattering through a locally periodic hamiltonian with @xmath4 cells ( scatterers ) . the optical @xmath1 matrix , that depends on the transport properties of a single cell only , is calculated in the crystalline limit ( @xmath5 ) as a function of the frequency . </S>",

    "<S> averages and distributions of measurable quantities are of primordial interest in all areas of physics . </S>",
    "<S> when a physical system has a large number of particles , as in statistical mechanics , averages and distributions are preferred rather than follow the dynamics of all particles . in a different context , with one complex physical system only , several physical quantities present a strong dependence on external parameters like the energy , an external magnetic field or the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> thus averages and distributions of such quantities are better candidates to study than particular values of them at a fixed value of the external parameter ; the averages are usually performed using the external parameters . in wave transport through complex mesoscopic systems , averages and distributions of quantities like the conductance or the reflection coefficient are of great interest since they are measurable _ par excellence_. those quantities present not only sample - to - sample fluctuations but also when varying the external parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in general the elements of the scattering matrix have interest since , on the one hand , they are closely related to the conductance through landauer s formula  @xcite . on the other hand , in chaotic microwave cavities  @xcite and graphs  @xcite , and more recently in elastic plates  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the elements of the scattering matrix are directly accessible to the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> in several recent studies energy averages are used in quantities of experimental interest as in the poisson s kernel and its different variants  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model used to study poisson s kernel consists of a one - dimensional cavity formed between a delta potential and an impenetrable wall  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum particles are sent from the open side to the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> eventually those particles are measured outside _ via _ the scattering @xmath1 matrix . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 scattering matrix can be expressed as a phase @xmath7 and then , in the argand plane , it lies on the unit circle . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-matrix is distributed according with the poisson s kernel  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , obtained from the numerical data , is averaged over the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the question we want to solve is : it is possible to calculate analytically the average @xmath0 at a fixed energy using several potentials to get a kind of `` _ ensemble average _ '' . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see below the answer is yes .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> the average of the scattering matrix @xmath0 is obtained analytically for the first time . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , a family @xmath2 of scattering systems is built . </S>",
    "<S> element @xmath3 of the family yields the scattering through a locally periodic hamiltonian with @xmath4 scatterers . a recursive relation , that relates the system with @xmath4 scatterers in terms o a system with @xmath10 scatterers , is used to obtain a stationary condition in the crystalline limit , _ i. e. _ when @xmath11 . within the gaps of the periodic system </S>",
    "<S> , the stationary @xmath1-matrix corresponds to the optical matrix . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical continuation gives the result for the bands . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath0 , calculated in this way , depends on the properties of a single cell only and can then be used in poisson s kernel . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical result is tested in a 1d chain of delta potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated distribution shows perfect agreement with numerical results , without free parameters , in two cases : i ) @xmath4 fixed with energy variable and ii ) fixed energy with @xmath4 variable .    lets consider a family @xmath12 of quantum scattering systems in which member @xmath13 yields the scattering of a quantum particle by @xmath4 identical scatterers arranged periodically in a linear chain </S>",
    "<S> ( see figure  [ fig.ensemble ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chain is bounded at one side by a step potential of height @xmath14 . at the other side , that remains open , </S>",
    "<S> quantum particles are incident with an energy @xmath15 below @xmath14 . for these systems the transport properties </S>",
    "<S> are described by the @xmath6 scattering matrix @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that element @xmath13 corresponds to a _ locally periodic _ structure with @xmath4 cells  @xcite and that a crystalline structure , with bands and gaps , emerges in the limit @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> each cell , of length @xmath21 , is composed by a barrier whose potential is of general shape within the length @xmath22 , and a free space of length @xmath23 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the scattering matrix @xmath3 of the system with @xmath4 scatterers can be written in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath24 of the potential with @xmath10 scatterers plus the scattering matrix @xmath25 of the scatterer added through the recursive relation developed recently by two of us  @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 being @xmath29 the wave number and @xmath30 the mass of the particle . a similar recurrence relation for scattering systems </S>",
    "<S> was found in a cayley tree  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each scatterer is described by the potential @xmath31 of arbitrary shape and finite range @xmath22 ; the free space between adjacent scatterers is @xmath23 with @xmath32 , being @xmath21 the distance between scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33 scattering matrix @xmath34 will be associated to each scatterer , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the reflection and transmission amplitudes for incidence on the left ( right ) of the scatterer , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> notice that both the reflection and transmission amplitudes , and then @xmath3 , depend intrinsically on the energy . </S>",

    "<S> when the energy is inside a band , on the other hand , the phase visits all values of the phase following the distribution known as poisson s kernel ( see below ) . a third case that corresponds to energies around the band edges </S>",
    "<S> will not be discussed here  @xcite . within the gaps ( @xmath39 ) </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : poissonn ] )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a _ reasonable guess _ for the average of the scattering matrix within the bands is the analytical continuation of the fixed point solution calculated for the gap . in this case </S>",

    "<S> notice that both expressions for @xmath9 depend only on the reflection and transmission amplitudes of a single cell . </S>",
    "<S> all dependence on the shape of the potential as well as on the wave number are included here . </S>",
    "<S> thus a parameter - free poisson s kernel , completely determined by one single cell , holds in this case .    to test the previous result lets consider a numerical example in which each scatterer is given by a delta potential of intensity @xmath49 . in this case @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) the phase is plotted as a function of @xmath53 , for @xmath54 and different values of @xmath4 . in this figure </S>",

    "<S> the responses of the different elements of the family as a function of the energy is plotted in panel ( e ) of figure  ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) ; in order to show results in the stationary regime , the transitory states are avoided by plotting only the last 30 iterations of a family of 1000 consecutive elements . as it can be seen in this figure </S>",
    "<S> the phase shows two behaviors : within the gaps the phase reaches a fixed point whereas in the bands the phase sweeps the complete range in an non - uniform way . </S>",

    "<S> for the first ( second ) gap the solution corresponds to the plus ( minus ) sign , while the minus ( plus ) sign is a unstable solution . for the bands </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior occurs : a stable solution , which corresponds to the maximum of the phase distribution , takes the minus sign for the first window and is alternating for windows of @xmath41 odd or even , respectively .    . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition for the recurrence is @xmath55 . </S>",

    "<S> for the first gap the continuous ( red ) line corresponds to the stable solution @xmath56 , while the dashed ( green ) line is the unstable solution @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the stable solution is indistinguishable from the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> the stable solution blue ( cyan ) dashed line of the first ( second ) band gives the maximum of the phase distribution given by @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unstable solution is not plotted in the band . ]    to show that a system with many scatterers at fixed energy is distributed according with poisson s kernel , lets consider a family of 20,000 consecutive elements of the family from which only the last 5,000 values will be taken . on the one hand , </S>",
