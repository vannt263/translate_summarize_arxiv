    "the discovery of the top quark in 1995 @xcite marked the triumph of the standard model(sm ) of particle physics .",
    "since the discovery , more interest on researches in top quark physics is stimulated in both experimental and theoretical respects .",
    "because of its large mass which is close to the electroweak scale , the top quark physics research may play an important role in the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking and therefore of the origin of the fermion masses . through the study on it , especially its rare decays",
    ", people also hope to find clues of possible `` new physics '' .    within the framework of sm",
    "the dominant top quark decay mode is @xmath4 , which has a time scale @xmath5 much shorter than that of the non - perturbative qcd effect .",
    "this character of top quark makes it behaves almost like a free particle , which is helpful to the precise study of it . with the operation of cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the future",
    "there will be enormous top quark events obtained every year and that provides it practically possible to make a more detailed study on many properties of top quark .    up to now",
    ", the rare top decays have been investigated by several groups within the sm@xcite and beyond , e.g. in 2-higgs doublet model(2hdm ) @xcite and supersymmetric(susy ) models @xcite . in sm ,",
    "the branching ratios are heavily suppressed because of the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani(gim ) , typically @xmath6 @xcite . though they may be greatly enhanced by new contributions from beyond the sm ,",
    "the rare top decays are still quite small with only few cases up to the measurable levels of the near future top producing machines , like the upgraded tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "the decay channel @xmath0 was once investigated for the aim of studying cp - violation and it was also claimed having an accessible rate for the future experiments based on a quite rough assumption on the non - perturbative sector of the heavy quarkonium @xcite , which leads to about two orders of magnitude overestimate of the rate , to be seen in the following .    in this paper , we will investigate the top decay @xmath0 process with taking into account both the color - singlet and -octet mechanisms in the @xmath2 production calculation .",
    "we find the process is worth being carefully investigated in testing the sm and especially in searching new physics signatures for the following arguments .",
    "first , comparing with the meson decays , the top quark decays possess less theoretical uncertainties , e.g. without non - perturbative long distance influence because of its large mass scale .",
    "second , the concerned decay mode occurs at tree - level , which may cause the decay rate larger than that of rare top decays .",
    "third , theoretically the heavy quarkonium , @xmath7 , can be treated in a relatively high precision by virtue of the non - relativistic qcd(nrqcd ) factorization scheme @xcite . besides , from the experimental point of view , heavy quarkonia have clean signatures in their leptonic decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the formalism of the concerned process @xmath0 in a general framework . in section 3 the obtained formalism",
    "is applied to some specific models , the sm and minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) with and without @xmath1parity violation ( mssm@xmath8 ) .",
    "the numerical evaluation is proceeded in section 4 , and in the last section some conclusions are made .",
    "to lowest order , it is quite clear that the interested decay channel can be induced by intermediate bosons , for example the @xmath9 in the sm . in order to be more general and convenient to incorporate contributions from different models , in the following we give out the expression of the decay amplitude in a universal form .",
    "the tree - level amplitude of @xmath0 could be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the intermediate particles ( @xmath12boson , charged higgs , etc . ) , which are normalized by the standard @xmath9-boson coupling for the sake of convenience ; @xmath13 represents the remnant in the final states in respect to the @xmath7 production . for abbreviation ,",
    "the caret means the corresponding quantity is normalized by the top quark mass @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . the four - quark non - local operators appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) are of the types @xmath16   \\left [ \\bb \\ , \\left ( \\sum_{i } { g^\\prime_i } g_i \\right ) t \\right ] \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : op } \\\\[6pt ] \\o_-^\\b & = & \\left [ \\cb \\ , \\left(\\sum_{i } h_i h_i \\right ) t \\right ]   \\left [ \\bb \\ , \\left(\\sum_{i } { h^\\prime_i } h_i \\right ) b\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{neutral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the couplings of the fermion interactions , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the possible tensor structures of the currents .",
    "it is noticed that although in principle the quarkonium can be generated through the neutral current of form ( [ neutral ] ) , however , it is obvious that this kind of possible operators , which produce @xmath2 from a neutral heavy vector boson , are of kinematically disfavored ones in leading order since the possible large virtuality of intermediate particles . therefore , it is proper we restrict ourselves to the dominant contribution , i.e. form ( [ eq : op ] ) . as well , in our discussion the penguin process of the quarkonium production via gluon fragmentation is also dropped because that is suppressed by both the gim mechanism and the smallness of the higher order quarkonium fock states @xcite .    in the top quark rest frame , the @xmath21 , which denotes the propagator of @xmath11 ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath22 with @xmath23 this is obtained by performing the integrations over the final state phase space at the level of decay width , while adding the unstable particle decay width to the propagator , and , here and in the after , the lowest order approximation relations in the quarkonium system , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are taken , or in other words , in the effective lagrangian method the relative movement effects of heavy quarks within the quarkonium appears only in the nonperturbative sector .",
    "since we only consider the @xmath26 in further discussion , we can simply drop the subscript @xmath27 in @xmath21 , and then @xmath28 will represent @xmath29 for short .    with performing the fierz transformation on ( [ eq : op ] ) and considering of only the suitable operators in producing @xmath7 ,",
    "the operator @xmath26 could be read as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of colors and @xmath32   \\left [ \\bb \\ , \\g^\\mu p_i \\ , b \\right ] \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : om } \\\\[6 pt ] \\ot_-^\\b & = &   \\sum_{i=\\pm } g_i^\\b { g^\\prime_i}^\\b \\ ,   \\left [ \\cb \\ , \\g_\\mu p_i \\ , \\la^a \\ , t \\right ]   \\left [ \\bb \\ , \\g^\\mu p_i \\ , \\la^a \\ , b \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : ot } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 representing the @xmath34 gell - mann matrices",
    ". here @xmath35 are chirality projection operators . at the first sight eq.([eq : om ] ) appears to be the same structure with ( [ neutral ] ) , actually they possess different natures in describing quarkonium production .",
    "therefore , the operators in eq.([11 ] ) may be rearranged as @xmath36 where the first term is called the color suppressed one .",
    "next , by taking only the leading - order(lo ) electroweak effects into account one could replace @xmath37 by @xmath38 the higher order corrections to these values , either from the qcd or higher order electroweak corrections , should be small because of the large top mass scale . whereas , together with the arguments in before , the @xmath39 term can definitely be discarded without losing accuracy .    in the nrqcd framework of factorization",
    ", the heavy quarkonium production can be properly separated into two sectors , the perturbative qcd calculable part and the non - perturbative universal matrix elements .",
    "the latter is ordered in the relative velocity , @xmath40 , of the quarks within the quarkonium system . according to the nrqcd",

    "<S> the top quark decay process @xmath0 is studied in the standard model and the minimal supersymmetric standard model with conserved and violated @xmath1parity . in dealing with the heavy quarkonium , @xmath2 , production , we take both color - singlet and -octet mechanisms into consideration . with numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> it is found that within the standard model the decay rate of the concerned process is beyond the border of reachable level of the next round of experiment , though it is much larger than that of the rare top decays , while extra new contributions from beyond the standard model could enhance the decay rate by several orders . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noticed that a precise measurement of the charged higgs mass without @xmath3 dependence is possible via this process .    </S>",
