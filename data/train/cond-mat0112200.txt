    "weak noncovalent bonding forces govern functioning and structural cohesion in cells . direct measurements of these forces through mechanical means has recently become an important tool in studies of biological molecules .",
    "there is a variety of techniques for probing forces in the pico- and nano - newton range @xcite such as atomic force microscopy@xcite , optical tweezers @xcite , the surface force apparatus @xcite , micropipette aspiration@xcite , and the quartz microbalance @xcite . as examples of recent achievements , we may list elucidation of the nature of interactions of a chaperone protein ( hiv-1 ) with dna through stretching of a strand of the dna with optical tweezers @xcite and discovery of stick - slip motion when two strands of a dna double helix are pulled apart @xcite . +",
    "the techniques used in mechanical unfolding of individual biological molecules rely on tethering of the molecule between movable surfaces .",
    "this tethering is relatively easy to accomplish with long molecules such as dna and giant proteins such as titin @xcite which are naturally built as a tandem array of many globular domains . for shorter molecules ,",
    "the pulling surfaces interact and affect the pulled molecule in a way that makes the data hard to interpret . in order to extend the method to single domained proteins , yang et al .",
    "@xcite have recently developed a method of synthesizing identical repeats of protein molecules in the solid state which were then studied using a modified scanning force microscope . this technique has been applied to t4 lysozyme .",
    "+ at this moment , experimental data on the mechanical unfolding of the secondary structures of proteins are not available .",
    "however , data on periodically repeated proteins and even individual proteins may become available in the near future . from a theoretical point of view , it is important to gain an understanding of the basic unfolding mechanisms of simple structures and to develop analytical tools that could then be used for large proteins .",
    "this process is facilitated by considering simple models that allow a rapid exploration of parameter space .",
    "our choice in this paper is to analyze go - like models @xcite which emphasize the importance of native conformations and treat non - native interactions only schematically .",
    "the go - like models @xcite , though coarse - grained , are fairly realistic @xcite in their kinetic properties and allow for a thorough characterization and comparison of mechanical , equilibrium and folding properties in a straightforward manner .",
    "this kind of full characterization is difficult to achieve in all - atom models with the amber @xcite or charmm @xcite force fields which nevertheless are well suited to studies of mechanical stretching .",
    "+ the idea that mechanical unfolding experiments on proteins have the potential to provide insights into the relevant folding pathways is what motivated bryant et al .",
    "@xcite to carry out all - atom ( charmm - based ) simulations of the c - terminal hairpin of protein g , the folding of which has been previously studied experimentally by munoz et al .",
    "they have found that , under low pulling forces , breakdown of hydrogen bonds precedes dissociation of the hydrophobic cluster .",
    "their interpretation of this finding is that thermal folding should proceed in the opposite order to mechanical unfolding .",
    "if so , then the zippering folding mechanism @xcite would be less favored than one in which a hydrophobic cluster is formed first .",
    "this prediction remains to be tested .",
    "+ here , we explore properties of go models of proteins through molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we consider the variant in which contact interactions are described by lennard - jones potentials .",
    "the simulations include a langevin noise term which both mimics presence of a solvent and controls the temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "this paper focuses on an @xmath0 - helix of 16 monomers , denoted as h16 ; a @xmath1 - hairpin of 16 monomers , b16 ; and a double repeat of the @xmath0 - helix , h16 - 2 .",
    "the companion paper @xcite describes a similar analysis for titin .",
    "+ we first study mechanical unfolding at nearly zero temperature .",
    "this choice of @xmath3 minimizes fluctuations and rate dependence , and most simply reveals the effects of the structure of the energy landscape .",
    "the results should be equivalent@xcite to fast stretching at higher @xmath3 , and temperature dependence will be considered in subsequent work . the protein is stretched by a hookean cantilever and the force is plotted as a function of the cantilever displacement .",
    "we also characterize the stretching process by studying the succession of unfolding events , which are described by the cantilever displacements at which specific contacts are broken . both the force - displacement curve and the order of unfolding events depend on the stiffness and velocity of the cantilever .",
    "we next discuss studies of folding , where temperature plays an essential role .",
    "the sequencing of folding events depends on @xmath3 , and smooth and simple pathways are only found near an optimal temperature denoted by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the sequencing of folding events near @xmath4 is contrasted with that of stretching events for different protein structures .",
    "we find that both sequencings are governed primarily by the contact order @xcite , i.e. by the distance between two amino acids along the sequence of the protein .",
    "however , the cross - correlations between thermal and mechanical sequencings are opposite for the two simple cases considered : h16 and b16 . only in the latter case",
    "do folding and stretching occur in the opposite order , as envisioned by , e.g. , bryant et al .",
    "in general , the thermal and mechanical pathways can be very different . +",
    "another quantity that we study here is what we propose to call an irreversibility length , @xmath5 .",
    "if one studies folding from a fully extended conformation , then one finds that the characteristic folding time diverges as @xmath60 .",
    "thus a fully stretched protein will not fold back to the native state at low temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "a protein that is pulled only slightly will return to its native shape on release .",
    "there must then be a characteristic stretched length of the protein , @xmath5 , which separates the two behaviors .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath5 does indeed exist and find that it is substantially larger for b16 than for h16 .",
    "furthermore , the folding time for lengths less than @xmath5 is a complicated function of the mechanical extension .",
    "+ we also consider a tandem arrangement of two @xmath0-helices and find that the constituent helices unravel almost simultaneously whereas in titin @xcite the unraveling is serial in nature .",
    "simple criteria for the two types of behavior are described .",
    "the model we use is described in detail in references @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the variant where steric constraints associated with dihedral and other angles are ignored .",
    "briefly , a protein is modeled by a chain of identical beads which correspond to the locations of the c@xmath7 atoms .",
    "the consecutive beads interact through the potential @xcite @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the distance between two consecutive beads , @xmath10  , @xmath11@xmath12 @xmath13@xmath12 , and @xmath14 is the characteristic energy parameter corresponding to a native contact .",
    "the anharmonic term in equation ( 1 ) prevents energy localization in specific phonons and thus accelerates equilibration @xcite .",
    "+ the interaction that governs the native contacts ( defined as those c@xmath0 that are not immediate neighbors , but are no further than 7.5  apart in the native structure ) is chosen to be of the lennard - jones type ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath15,\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath16 are chosen so that each contact in the native structure is stabilized at the minimum of the potential , and @xmath17  is a typical value . as a technical criterion for determining when a native contact forms or breaks during the time evolution , we adopted the cutoff value of 1.5@xmath18 .",
    "the non - native contacts are described by purely repulsive potentials .",
    "these are obtained by evaluating @xmath19 with a length parameter @xmath20 , truncating the potential at its minimum ( @xmath21 ) , and shifting it to have zero value at this cutoff distance .",
    "+ figure 1 illustrates the forms of the potentials for the @xmath0-helix . when studying the folding times ,",
    "we have adopted a simplified approach in which a protein is considered folded if all beads that form a native contact are within the cutoff distance of @xmath22 instead of making a more precise delineation of the native basin as in ref .",
    "this will allow for a more meaningful comparison with the results on titin @xcite .",
    "+ the beads are coupled to langevin noise and damping terms to mimic the effect of the surrounding solution and maintain constant temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the equations of motion for each bead are @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the amino acids represented by each bead , @xmath25 is the net force due to the molecular potentials and external forces , @xmath26 is the damping constant , and @xmath27 is a gaussian noise term with dispersion @xmath28 .",
    "we measure time in units of the characteristic period of undamped oscillations in the lennard - jones potential @xmath29 . using typical values for the average amino acid mass , length and binding energy yields 3@xmath30 as an estimate of @xmath31 . according to veitshans",
    "@xcite , realistic estimates of damping by the solution correspond to a value of @xmath26 near 50 @xmath32 .",
    "however , the folding times have been found to depend on @xmath26 in a simple linear fashion for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thus in order to accelerate the simulations , we work with @xmath34 .",
    "the equations of motion are solved by means of the fifth order gear predictor - corrector algorithm @xcite with a time step of @xmath35 .",
    "+ in order to pull the protein apart , we attach both of its ends to purely harmonic springs of spring constant @xmath36 .",
    "we focus on three cases : a ) the stiff spring : @xmath37@xmath38 b ) the soft spring : @xmath39@xmath38 , and c)the very soft spring : @xmath40@xmath38 .",
    "the outer end of one spring is held stationary , and the other is pulled at a fixed rate @xmath41 .",
    "this models stretching by a hookean cantilever with stiffness @xmath42 , since the two springs add in series .",
    "we also performed simulations at constant force , which corresponds to the limit of infinitely weak springs .",
    "however , the unwinding of the proteins occurs in an `` all or nothing '' fashion in this limit , and little information can be extracted . + there are many ways to pick the pulling direction , and all of our mechanical results correspond to a case in which the extension is implemented parallel to the initial end - to - end vector . in most cases , we pull the spring very slowly  at a constant rate of @xmath43@xmath44",
    ". there is actually very little dependence of the results on pulling rate until one considers rapid rates .",
    "for instance , increasing @xmath41 by a factor of 50 produces almost no change in the force .",
    "substantial rate dependence begins when @xmath41 is increased by a factor of 100 to 0.5 @xmath44 , and this case is denoted as a `` fast '' stretch in the following section .",
    "the instantaneous pulling force @xmath45 is the extension of the pulling spring times the spring constant @xmath36 . plotted values of @xmath45",
    "are averaged over 1@xmath31 .",
    "the standard pulling velocity is low enough that the force equilibrates along the chain and almost the same force is obtained from the extension of the spring whose end is fixed .",
    "drag terms lead to a significant difference in these forces at higher velocities .",
    "the force is plotted versus the cantilever displacement @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the total pulling time .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the process of mechanical unfolding for h16 .",
    "it clearly shows that unfolding starts at both ends and then proceeds to the center .",
    "this is precisely the ordering of events during thermal folding @xcite and _ not _ the inverse of this ordering as seen for the c - terminal hairpin of protein g @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying reasons for the observed ordering during folding and unfolding are different .",
    "folding starts at the ends because they diffuse more rapidly and are thus more likely to fall into a contact situation , while unfolding starts at the ends because there are fewer binding forces there .",
    "+ the force vs. cantilever displacement curves are shown in figure 3 for slow ( solid lines ) and fast ( dashed lines ) displacement rates .",
    "the curves are truncated when the helix is fully stretched , and any further displacement results in rapid growth in @xmath45 followed by rupture of the protein backbone .",
    "the upper ( lower ) panels are for the stiff ( soft ) pulling springs . in both cases unfolding",
    "produces a sequence of stick - slip events .",
    "the force rises linearly while the protein is trapped in a given local energy minimum , and then drops rapidly as one or more contacts breaks .",
    "the slope of the upward rise is the combined stiffness @xmath48 of the protein @xmath49 and cantilever @xmath42 . since the two are in series , @xmath50 .",
    "in the soft spring case the cantilever dominates and the slope of the upward ramps is @xmath42 . for the stiff cantilever case the internal stiffness of the protein dominates .",
    "variations within and between local minima lead to changes in the slope of the ramps , with @xmath49 varying between about 0.3 and 0.6 @xmath51@xmath12 . once @xmath36 is larger than these values it has little influence on the curves .",
    "each upward ramp ends when one or more contacts break .",
    "the force drops sharply until the protein reaches a new metastable state and a new upward ramp begins . in the low velocity case ( solid lines ) , @xmath41 is much lower than the velocities produced by contact breaking , and rupture occurs at a nearly constant cantilever position . in this limit ,",
    "the force drop is roughly equal to @xmath48 times the change in protein length during the jump between metastable states . for a stiff cantilever ( top panel ) ,",
    "the failure of each contact produces a large drop in the force .",
    "the first two peaks correspond to breaking of the two end contacts . the force is lower than for later events because the ends have fewer native contacts .",
    "rupturing of the next series of bonds proceeds in an essentially periodic pattern because each ruptured bond has the same environment .",
    "when the remaining helical segment is short enough , failure affects bonds across its entire length , leading to two higher peaks . in the final stages ( i.e. @xmath52  ) ,",
    "all the coils have been broken and the series of small force peaks is due to breaking of higher order bonds .    when a soft spring is used , the drop in force due to each event is smaller . if the threshold force for an event is lower than that for the previous event , the force may not drop below this threshold .",
    "this can cause several bond ruptures to accumulate into a single orchestrated event .",
    "the low velocity curve in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 has the same initial sequence of peaks as the upper panel : two small peaks are followed by several at the same higher force .",
    "however , those later peaks that are well below preceding peaks in the top panel are absent in the bottom panel .",
    "the strength of the contacts broken in these stages would be difficult to extract if a soft cantilever were used .",
    "+ when the pulling velocity is comparable to the rapid motions produced by bond rupture , the cantilever motion can produce a substantial change in force during an unfolding event .",
    "this can also cause events to accumulate as shown in both panels .",
    "the increase in speed also produces a larger drag force from the surrounding solution ( represented by the langevin damping ) .",
    "this shifts the force curves to higher values .",
    "+ the optimal temperature for folding of h16 has been established to be @xmath53 @xcite . the sequencing of thermal folding and unfolding events at @xmath4 is shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the former figure considers establishment of the contacts of the @xmath54 type , i.e. the hydrogen - bonded contacts , whereas the latter is for the @xmath55 contacts .",
    "the time for establishing of a given contact is denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "these times are symmetrically arranged around the center of the helix and are shortest at the ends .",
    "we have also determined times for thermal unfolding , @xmath57 , defined as times at which the contact is gone for the first time .",
    "values of @xmath57 in figures 4 and 5 are averaged over 1500 different trajectories which all start in the native state .",
    "we notice that @xmath57 is an order of magnitude longer than @xmath56 but it is also arranged symmetrically around the center of the helix .",
    "figures 4 and 5 also show the displacements , @xmath58 , at which each bond ruptures during mechanical unfolding for stiff ( closed circles ) and soft ( open circles ) cantilevers .",
    "these curves do not have the same symmetry as the thermal folding and unfolding curves . as noted above , the end bonds break first because they have fewer native contacts .",
    "subsequent bonds have the same number of contacts and should break at the same force . however , the bonds near the pulling end ( large @xmath59 ) tend to break first due to the presence of a small extra drag force .",
    "this is independent of the nature of the cantilever except that the soft spring yields uniformly larger @xmath58 at which a bond breaks .",
    "+ despite the lack of symmetry in the mechanical data , the folding times and contact breaking distances are clearly correlated .",
    "this is shown in figures 6 and 7 for the stiff and soft spring respectively . in each figure , contacts breaking at later times tend to break at larger displacements .",
    "+    we now consider two h16 helices connected in series by one extra peptide bond and stretched from one end .",
    "figure 8 shows a snapshot of a partially unfolded tandem conformation .",
    "it indicates that the two helices unfold simultaneously with some phase shift between them .",
    "this is also seen in the @xmath60 curves shown in figure 9 where the stick - slip patterns essentially double each feature seen in figure 3 .",
    "this behavior is quite distinct from what happens when stretching titin where the domains unfold one at a time @xcite .",
    "the basic reason that the helices unfold simultaneously is that the force to break contacts rises smoothly during the unfolding process .",
    "the heights of the force peaks only drop in the very late stages of growth when the coils are all gone . in the case of titin , one of the early peaks is higher than subsequent peaks . once this contact breaks in one of the repeat units",
    ", there is a series of weaker bonds that can continue to rupture within that unit .",
    "these contact failures keep the force from rising back to a level that would initiate failure of the strong bonds in other repeat units .",
    "+ the simultaneous unwinding of the two helices is also seen in figure 10 which is an analog of figure 4 for the single helix ( minus the data on thermal unfolding ) .",
    "the distance for contact rupture ( for @xmath54 contacts ) through stretching shows two skewed peaks , each centered in the vicinity of the centers of the individual helices . in contrast , the average times for unfolding at @xmath61 are peaked not at the centers of the helices but at the very center of the whole system , i.e. around the peptide bond that connects the helices .",
    "thus the simple correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath56 that was seen in figures 6 and 7 is lost .",
    "instead one finds a two - legged correlation that is shown in figure 11 .",
    "note also that all of the contacts ( all are short ranged and are grouped into three types : @xmath62 , @xmath55 , and @xmath54 ) break throughout the full range of the displacement of the cantilever .",
    "some bonds of a given kind break early , some break late .",
    "we shall see in the companion paper @xcite that failure of long range bonds shows a definite correlation with the displacement .",
    "+    the stretching of the @xmath1-hairpin b16 , shown in figure 12 , consists of a gradual removal of the `` rungs '' of the `` ladder '' that form the hairpin , starting from the free ends .",
    "physically , these rungs represent hydrogen bonds and they correspond to contacts 1 - 16 , 2 - 15 , 3 - 14 , ... , 7 - 10 .",
    "there are other contact forces in our go model and they provide further stabilization of the structure . these other bonds bind bead 1 with bead 15 , bead 2 with 14 and 16 , etc .",
    "+ plots of @xmath45 versus @xmath63 during unfolding at low @xmath41 are shown in figure 13 .",
    "all show regular stick - slip features . in this respect ,",
    "our results are very similar to those obtained by bryant et al .",
    "@xcite with full atom simulations .",
    "thus our simplified model reproduces the features present in the more realistic calculation .",
    "furthermore , since our model incorporates the native conformation but not the hydrophobic or polar properties of the amino acids , we suggest that the latter are not explicitly crucial in the mechanical unfolding of the hairpin .",
    "the stiff and soft springs produce the same sequence of stick - slip peaks , but the slope of the ramps and depth of the drops are smaller for the soft spring . after the first peak , peaks come in pairs where the second peak has a lower height .",
    "when a very soft spring is used , these pairs merge into single large events as described above .",
    "+ the folding properties of b16 are illustrated in figure 14 .",
    "this system has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the native basin has been accurately determined through a `` shape distortion technique '' @xcite which produces @xmath4 of order 0.07@xmath64 . if the folding criterion is based on just establishing the native contacts , then , in the case of b16 , there is a very broad dependence of the folding time on temperature and the kinetics of folding at 0.07@xmath64 is almost the same as at , say , 0.3 @xmath64 .",
    "nevertheless we study the system at the previously determined @xmath4 .",
    "note that even with the contact - based criterion for folding , the folding time for b16 is still considerably longer than for h16 .",
    "+ figure 14 shows that the sequencing of folding events in b16 is exactly opposite to the succession of contact breakage upon stretching : b16 starts folding from the turn ( the result that has been found both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite ) whereas both mechanical and thermal unfolding start at the free ends .",
    "thus , in contrast to the @xmath65-helix , the mechanical unfolding of the @xmath1-hairpin is the inverse of the folding process .",
    "+ figure 15 shows @xmath58 as a function of the time needed to establish the contact during folding . here , in addition to the `` rung '' contacts ,",
    "the remaining contacts are also shown .",
    "since contacts rupture at a fixed force , the soft spring data are shifted to larger displacements than the the stiff spring data .",
    "however both sets of data show a clear anticorrelation between thermal folding and mechanical unfolding that is in a sharp contrast to the results for the @xmath0-helix .",
    "+    we now consider pulling of a protein at a constant slow rate and then releasing it .",
    "we ask what is the time required to fold back to the native state at @xmath66 .",
    "there must be a limit to the extension beyond which the protein misfolds on release .",
    "figure 16 shows that this limit indeed exists . the dependence on cantilever stiffness",
    "is minimized by plotting the refolding times against the end - to - end distance @xmath67 of the protein rather than the cantilever displacement . for both stiffnesses",
    "the refolding times are found to be non - monotonic functions of @xmath67 .",
    "we interpret this as being due to inertial effects .",
    "the more stretched the protein is with a given set of contacts , the more potential energy is available .",
    "when the protein is released , the energy is converted into kinetic energy that speeds the contraction of the protein and aids it in getting over subsequent energy barriers .",
    "+ we identify the irreversibility length @xmath5 with the maximum value of @xmath67 where refolding occurs . for h16",
    ", @xmath5 is about 37 , or 1.6 times the native state end - to - end distance of 22.62  .",
    "the change in length is 14.4  which is very close to the displacement of the stiff cantilever at the onset of irreversibility @xmath68  .",
    "the displacement of the soft cantilever , @xmath69  , is larger because the cantilever stretches more in order to apply enough force to reach @xmath5 . examining figure 3 , we see that both values of @xmath70 correspond to the displacement after the sixth peak in the respective force curve .",
    "thus the same set of broken bonds is required to produce irreversibility for either cantilever stiffness . + for b16 , the native @xmath67 is only 5    and the stretching factor to @xmath5 is substantially larger , around 11.6 .",
    "the values of @xmath70 for stiff and soft cantilevers are @xmath71 and 65.9 , respectively . from figure 13",
    "we see that in both cases the irreversibility point is just past the last peak in the force curve .",
    "since the protein is fully stretched at this point , any native contacts are enough to ensure refolding .",
    "+ the misfolded conformations , that are obtained on refolding beyond the threshold , are shown in figure 17 . in the case of b16",
    ", the turn region freezes into the wrong configuration which is almost straight . in the case of h16 , the first turn coils with the wrong chirality .",
    "we have studied the force - displacement curves for secondary structures of proteins for two models of cantilever stiffness and several pulling speeds .",
    "a series of stick - slip events is observed as contacts break .",
    "stiff cantilevers pulled at low rates provide the most detailed information about the breaking of individual contacts .",
    "multiple contact ruptures merge into single events when the stiffness is decreased or the speed is increased . + the simple expectation that mechanical unraveling should proceed in the inverse order from thermal folding",
    "is only confirmed in the case of the @xmath1-hairpin . in the case of the @xmath0-helix , unraveling and folding follow the same order . when multiple helices are connected in tandem ,",
    "the correlation becomes even more complex .",
    "the two helices unravel simultaneously with each helix uncoiling from both of its ends .",
    "in contrast , folding occurs first at the outer ends of the pair of helices . in general",
    "there is no reason to expect a simple correlation between thermal folding and mechanical unfolding of proteins . in the following paper",
    "we examine similar issues of mechanical - thermal correlations for a protein with a significant number of long - ranged contacts .",
