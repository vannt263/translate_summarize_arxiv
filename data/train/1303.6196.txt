    "<S> the cooper pair splitting amplitude is directly described by @xmath79 , and the corresponding curve @xmath93 [ fig . [ fig : results ] ( c ) ] captures indeed a similar behavior as the ideal case of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : optimal ] , with @xmath47 in the @xmath32 regions where the levels of different valleys approach each other and the spin projections rotate [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] ( b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the measurable conductances @xmath94 , however , contain with @xmath95 contributions that represent strong enough local distortions to suppress @xmath31 below 2 . in the right </S>",
    "<S> qd the local distortions are enhanced by level overlaps close to @xmath96 where the @xmath97 and @xmath98 levels become degenerate [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] ( b ) ] , and indeed @xmath99 decreases in this region . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the left qd levels remain well separated , and @xmath100 mirrors the upturn of @xmath93 , with @xmath79 overruling the @xmath101 contribution . the same behavior with @xmath102 </S>",
    "<S> is found near @xmath103 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath104 corresponds to an experiment of electron injection through a normal lead and contains with @xmath80 a component describing the uncorrelated single - particle transport . </S>",
    "<S> since we find that @xmath80 and @xmath79 have a similar amplitude , we expect that @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath80 contains also the higher order tunneling processes that represent the nonlocal distortions , which may cause @xmath106 to increase again . nonetheless , we find that @xmath107 with a similar shape as @xmath93 , indicating that the nonlocal distortions have a negligible effect .    while @xmath79 produces the purest indicator of spin entanglement , it is only indirectly accessible by experiments . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the directly measurable @xmath108 are obscured by the local contributions of the @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> a method of circumventing this problem is to consider products of the @xmath94 , such as @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> since the projections @xmath109 eliminate all qd degrees of freedom , the product @xmath70 is equivalent to a nonlocal current measurement with a density matrix @xmath110 whose nonlocal contribution is encoded in @xmath111 . by the higher power of @xmath55 and the projections , the relative weight of the local contributions can be reduced , while a spin singlet in @xmath112 remains a spin singlet in @xmath113 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] ( c ) we see that the corresponding curve @xmath114 follows almost perfectly @xmath93 , showing that the multiplication @xmath70 is powerful enough to suppress the local distortions in the @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a high splitting efficiency of a cps is not a primary requirement for the proposed bell test .    to demonstrate that the large @xmath31 value is indeed an effect of superconductivity </S>",
    "<S> , we show with @xmath115 the corresponding curve for @xmath116 obtained for the normal state . the fact that @xmath117 is the strongest indicator that @xmath118 demonstrates indeed the spin entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have truncated the curves in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : results ] close to @xmath119 and @xmath120 where qd levels strongly overlap [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] ( b ) ] and spin correlators can no longer be reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed important to maintain well separated qd levels . </S>",
    "<S> hence the charging energy of the qds , which has been neglected in the microscopic calculation , plays here an important role as it increases the level separation but has much reduced exchange coupling due to the soi induced spin projections of the qd levels .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_. we have demonstrated that due to soi effects bent cnt - cps ( or two cnts under an angle ) can be used for entanglement detection in the steady state by a violation of the bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> notable for the bell inequality is that the set of axes @xmath121 along which the spin correlators must be measured can be arbitrary and the precise axis orientations , i.e. , the precise soi strengths , do not need to be known . </S>",
    "<S> this is an advantage over entanglement witnesses @xcite or quantum state tomography . </S>",
    "<S> although discussed for cnts , the introduced concept of entanglement detection is general and can be implemented in any system allowing tunable spin - energy filtering . </S>",
    "<S> for an ideal cnt - cps , a violation of the bell inequality can be achieved for most cnts over a large range of orientations of an external field @xmath0 with strength @xmath54 , which for usual cnts are @xmath122 t. the robustness of this behavior was confirmed by a microscopic calculation that incorporates the local and nonlocal imperfections of a realistic system . from the results we propose the use of the product of conductances @xmath70 as the optimal observable for testing the bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we have furthermore argued that the spin reconstruction in semiconducting cnts is robust against disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , it should be noted that a bending of the cnt is not an absolute requisite . </S>",
    "<S> an equivalent effect can be obtained by applying individual @xmath0 fields on the qds or by providing a constant field offset on one qd by placing a ferromagnet in its vicinity , if sufficient control of the typical field strengths @xmath123 t can be granted . </S>",
    "<S> if two separate cnts are connected to the superconductor , they should have similar diameters such that their @xmath40 are comparable .    _ </S>",
