    "stellar components in a galaxy originate either from _ in - situ _ star formation or from `` merger accretion '' .",
    "two modes of star formation are considered : `` quiescent '' mode and merger - induced `` starburst '' . stars in a galaxy can therefore have four different origins : ( 1 ) _ in - situ _ quiescent star formation , ( 2 ) _ in - situ _ starburst , ( 3 ) merger accretion of stars formed in quiescent mode , and ( 4 ) merger accretion of stars formed in burst mode .",
    "figure  [ components ] shows the decomposition of the four channels as a function of time for the three different mass groups .",
    "the top and bottom rows show the absolute stellar mass evolution and relative mass fraction evolution , respectively .",
    "several remarkable features are visible , more easily in the bottom rows .",
    "first , _ in - situ _ quiescent star formation is an important channel for the stellar components in massive galaxies .",
    "its fractional contribution is ( 30 , 60 , 80)% in rank ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) galaxies , respectively . _ in - situ _ quiescent star formation takes place on a galactic disk , and thus , one may wonder why its contribution is so large in these massive , and probably bulge - dominant galaxies .",
    "this is because massive bulge - dominant galaxies at @xmath4 have many late - type progenitors , and that is more pronounced in less massive galaxies ( rank 3 ) than in rank 1 galaxies .",
    "this is a reflection of the progenitor bias discussed earlier  ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "second , the stars formed in burst mode are an extreme minority ( @xmath175% ) in these massive galaxies .",
    "this result is somewhat unexpected . in the hierarchical universe , larger galaxies are generally a product of numerous mergers between galaxies .",
    "mergers , especially between similar - mass galaxies ( major mergers ) , cause a starburst , and so a naive expectation is that larger galaxies would have a large fraction of stars formed in burst mode .",
    "however , it is not that simple . starbursts are usually a result of major mergers , and major mergers are extremely rare once galaxies become massive , that is , at low redshifts .",
    "major mergers between massive galaxies sometimes occur at low redshifts , but they are most often dry , between early - type galaxies without much cold gas  ( c.f . * ? ? ?",

    "the solid , dashed , and dotted lines indicate the merger rates of rank 1 , 2 , and 3 galaxies , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    third , merger accretion is the dominant channel in the most massive galaxies .",
    "roughly 70% of the stellar components in the most massive group ( bottom left panel ) form outside direct progenitors and get accreted via mergers .",
    "this fraction is smaller for rank 2 ( 40% ) and rank 3 ( 20% ) galaxies , but still substantial .",
    "it is interesting to note that much of the mass difference between ranks is attributed to the difference in the amount of merger accretion .",
    "for example , roughly 80% of the mass difference between ranks 1 and 2 comes from the differences in merger accretion .",
    "the value is @xmath176% between ranks 2 and 3 .",
    "massive galaxies are so mainly because they have a substantial amount of _ in - situ _ quiescent star formation , but the _ most massive _ galaxies are so because they have acquired a large amount of mass through _ merger accretion . _",
    "the result is supported by previous studies .",
    "@xcite confirmed that bcgs have experienced no or negative evolution in luminosity during @xmath12 from the k - band hubble diagram for a sample of bcgs while they have increased their mass by a factor of two to four , depending on cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , it has been understood that merger and accretion may be the most plausible explanation for the evolution . using a semi - analytic model",
    ",  @xcite showed that most stellar components in model bcgs are formed in the very early age of the universe ( 80 % at @xmath177 ) in small progenitors and accreted onto bcgs far later ( 50% after @xmath178 ) via mergers .",
    "@xcite presented similar results , using numerical simulations .",
    "about 80% of stellar components in simulated massive galaxies ( @xmath179 at z=0 ) are formed outside in the early age ( @xmath180 ) and brought into the massive galaxies via mergers and accretion .",

    "they revealed that the fraction gets smaller in less massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite also found a similar trend in their investigation on two separate semi - analytic models .",
    "they demonstrated that the contribution of mergers to the bulge growth exceeds that of disk instability at @xmath182 .",
    "considering the fact that such massive galaxies ( @xmath183 ) are likely early type  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it implies that mergers play a more important role in the growth of massive galaxies .",
    "it should however be noted that disk instability which is more effective to the smaller late - type galaxy evolution may play a role in such progenitor galaxies of present - day massive early types .",
    "figure  [ merger_rate ] shows the merger rate evolution for baryonic mass ratios greater than or equal to 1:10 .",
    "although merger rates show stochastic effects , there is a clear decreasing tendency with time , whereas the star formation rates of the three groups drop more sharply , as shown in figure  [ sfr ] . in general , more massive galaxies are likely to be involved in galaxy mergers more frequently , so that more massive galaxies have many more stellar components born outside and accreted via mergers , as discussed above . during the whole calculation , rank 1 galaxies undergo about 9.0 mergers with a mass ratio greater than or equal to 1:10 while those in ranks 2 and 3 experience 4.0 and 1.0 mergers , respectively . during @xmath184 ,",
    "rank 1 , 2 , and 3 galaxies experience 3.5 , 1.8 , or 0.6 mergers for the same mass ratio criterion .",
    "this explains the higher contribution of merger accretion in more massive galaxies , as illustrated in figure  [ components ] .",
    "we found in the previous section that _ in - situ _ star formation and merger accretion were the two most significant channels for the stellar mass growth of massive galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we scrutinize their time evolution in greater detail .",
    "specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) are normalized growth rates of star formation histories .",
    "likewise , we hereby define the `` specific stellar accretion rate '' ( ssar ) to evaluate a normalized growth rate via mergers as follows : @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the mass of a galaxy at an epoch , and @xmath187 is an increment of mass by mergers during a time step @xmath188 . because we allow diffuse stellar components due to galaxy mergers , mass increment can be expressed as @xmath189 , as described in section 2.1 .",
    "figure  [ ssfr_sasr ] shows the evolution of the ssfrs ( upper ) and of the ssars ( bottom ) of direct progenitors . in general",
    ", more massive galaxies have lower ssfrs , as observations have shown  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while they have higher ssars than less massive galaxies .",
    "star formation rates are decreased by the depression of gas cooling rates due to an increase in the cooling timescale via the growth of halos , supernova feedback  @xcite and/or agn feedback  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cold gas reservoir of a galaxy could be reduced by feedback processes . besides ,",
    "if a galaxy orbits around a more massive galaxy , it becomes redder as it loses its hot gas , which is a source of cold gas , and its cold gas reservoir by tidal and ram pressure stripping  @xcite . on the other hand , accretion of stellar components via mergers",
    "is determined by gravitational interactions between host and subhalos alone ; hence , the accretion rate could remain relatively steady as halos continue to fall into other more massive halos over time .",
    "figure  [ dp_ssfr_sasr ] displays a comparison of the ssfrs and the ssars of direct progenitors . as illustrated in figure  [ components ] , quiescent star formation dominates the stellar mass growth history in @xmath6 ( rank 3 ) galaxies ( bottom panel ) . in rank 2",
    "galaxies , they are comparable to each other most of the time",
    ". however , _ in the most massive ( rank 1 ) galaxies , merger accretion takes over star formation as the most important channel of stellar mass growth around @xmath5 _ ( top panel ) .",
    "our result is qualitatively consistent with that of  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the assembly history of stellar components of massive ( super-@xmath6 ) galaxies , using semi - analytic approaches .",
    "our major results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* more massive galaxies grow _ in number _",
    "faster than less massive galaxies , as a result of the hierarchical nature of galaxy clustering .",
    "this result is consistent with the recent observation of mk10 . *",
    "the conflict between the predictions from hierarchical models and downsizing _ is _ reconcilable .",
    "if we consider only direct progenitors of massive galaxies , our models suggest `` upsizing '' rather than downsizing ; that is , the direct progenitors of more massive galaxies grow more slowly . however , if we consider _ all _ the progenitors , direct and collateral , the combined mass suggests downsizing .",
    "our models suggest that more massive galaxies have older stellar ages but younger assembly ages .",
    "* merger - induced `` bursty '' star formation is negligible compared to quiescent disk - mode star formation despite the fact that massive galaxies form through numerous mergers .",
    "this is because most of the gas - rich major mergers occur at high redshifts when galaxies are small , and recent major mergers tend to be rare and `` dry '' . *",
    "merger accretion is a growingly more important channel of stellar mass growth in more massive galaxies .",
    "it accounts for 70% of the final stellar mass in the most massive galaxies in our sample ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is merger accretion that causes much of the mass difference between massive galaxies .",
    "this implies that environments play a central role in the growth of massive galaxies . * in the most massive galaxies , which are likely brightest cluster galaxies , merger accretion has remained the most important channel of stellar mass growth ever since @xmath190 .    the origin of massive galaxies is a pivotal subject of cosmological paradigms and subsidiary galaxy formation theories .",
    "the simplest views based on some pieces of observations , such as downsizing , may favor simplistic formation scenarios , while dynamical models of the universe based on the current cosmology and other statistical aspects of observations , such as galaxy luminosity functions , indicate the other direction .",
    "this conflict is at its maximum when it comes to the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "the goal of this study is to reconcile the various perspectives and to have an accurate understanding on their formation . in this study",
    ", we showed that galaxy models in the hierarchical paradigm provide explanations to seemingly contradicting empirical constraints : the faster growth of the number of more massive galaxies ( mk10 ) and downsizing  @xcite .",
    "this is encouraging .",
    "galaxy formation models , whether hydrodynamic or semi - analytic , are still incomplete in many aspects : it is often claimed that much of their incompleteness is caused by our limited knowledge of baryon physics .",
    "the success of understanding _ massive _ galaxy formation on the other hand seems to be more hinged upon our knowledge of large - scale clusterings , and thus dark matter physics .",
