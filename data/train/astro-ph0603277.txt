    "gamma - ray bursts are short duration phenomena characterized by time - varying , high - energy , non - thermal electromagnetic emission . based on their duration and energy spectra they",
    "are typically categorized into two categories : `` short / hard '' and `` long / soft '' @xcite .",
    "many optical and x - ray counterparts of long bursts have been seen , some in coincidence with type ib / c supernovae , representing extremely energetic collapses of massive stars @xcite . by contrast , it has been much more difficult to identify counterparts for short grbs ( sgrbs ) , except for the known soft gamma repeaters , which may be observed as sgrbs @xcite , but can not explain more than a small fraction of the observed sgrb sample @xcite .",
    "recently , the _ swift _ and _ hete-2 _ satellites have localized for the first time the x - ray afterglow following short - period grbs : grbs 050509b @xcite , 050724 @xcite , 050813 @xcite , and 051221 @xcite by _ swift _ ; grb 050709 @xcite by _",
    "hete-2_. details about the physical parameters observed and inferred from these bursts can be found in @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the inferred host had a rather low star - formation rate .",
    "this finding disfavors the collapse of a massive star as a progenitor , since those systems have very short lifetimes . instead",
    ", it favors the identification of a compact object binary merger as the progenitor , as originally suggested by @xcite ; a significant fraction of both neutron star - neutron star ( nsns ) and black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) binaries will take longer than 1 gyr between formation and merger @xcite .",
    "other scenarios , such as the accretion - induced collapse of a ns with a wd companion have been proposed @xcite , but have not been studied numerically in as much detail .",
    "the observed characteristics of sgrbs can be examined in light of population synthesis calculations for compact object binaries , but it is difficult to disentangle bhns vs. nsns merger scenarios given the current observational and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the inferred rate of observed sgrbs and the merger rate of their putative sources are consistent , but the latter are uncertain by at least two orders of magnitude : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the beaming angle .",
    "the most recent grb rate estimates yield @xmath2 per milky way galaxy @xcite , over an order of magnitude larger than previous results @xcite .",
    "breaks in the observed x - ray spectra imply @xmath3 , and thus @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the predicted compact object merger rates per milky way galaxy fall in the range @xmath5 for nsns and @xmath6 for bhns @xcite .",
    "the rates are uncertain by at least an order of magnitude and the beaming angle by a factor of a few .",
    "an extremely high sgrb rate may indicate that at least some sgrbs are the products of nsns mergers , as these are much more common than bhns mergers in population synthesis calculations @xcite .",
    "the projected distance from a localized sgrb to the center of its host galaxy is insensitive to whether the merging binary is an nsns or bhns system .",
    "recent results show the respective projected distance likelihood functions are nearly the same for large galaxies , and have only minor differences in smaller ones , which would rule out positive identifications based on location alone @xcite .",
    "the range of fluxes seen from short grbs is rather large , indicating that the burst energy must depend sensitively on at least one parameter of the progenitor system .",
    "the observed fluxes of short grbs typically fall in the range @xmath7 , and fluences @xmath8 @xcite . assuming a characteristic distance of @xmath9",
    ", we see that the luminosities @xmath10 and total energy released @xmath11 for the burst satisfy @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the first localized short burst , grb 050509b , has an extremely low measured isotropic energy in @xmath14-rays , @xmath15 , compared to previously observed short grbs . assuming that the grb is at the measured redshift of @xmath16 , the luminosity of the burst is actually similar to the other localized bursts , @xmath17 , but it lasted for a much shorter time . in general , as we see from table 1 of @xcite , there is significantly smaller variation in the peak luminosity than in the isotropic energy output .",
    "we note that the low energy for grb 050509b argues for an extremely low density of baryons surrounding the grb .",
    "typically , it is assumed that the lorentz factor of the jet @xmath18 will be no bigger than the ratio @xmath19 of the energy in the jet to the rest energy of the baryons through which it must travel , i.e. @xmath20 @xcite . for grb 050509b",
    ", the least energetic of the observed bursts , assuming the lorentz factor @xmath21 @xcite implies that at most @xmath22 of material can surround the progenitor .",
    "these results are confirmed by the numerical calculations of @xcite , who find that the density of baryons surrounding the burst must fall rapidly with increasing radius . for sufficiently large baryonic loading ,",
    "they find the observational counterpart to a merger is not a grb .",
    "standard models for merger - induced short - duration grbs involve hot , massive accretion disks ( @xmath23 ) around spinning bhs ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) .",
    "as the disk is accreted , one of two possible mechanisms is responsible for the creation of a gamma - ray jet .",
    "one suggestion is that the hot material emits neutrino - antineutrino pairs that annihilate above and below the disk to produce a relativistic jet containing @xmath24 pairs and photons ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "calculations of accreting disks have shown that they can generate sufficient energy to power a gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "the viscosity in the disk primarily determines the timescale of the resulting burst @xcite , while the mass of the bh may determine the overall energy scale @xcite .",
    "these results are supported by @xcite , who find that the viscosity ( and to a lesser extent ,",
    "bh spin and disk mass ) are responsible for determining the overall burst energy . roughly speaking ,",
    "luminosities of up to @xmath25 can be produced , so long as the disk is sufficiently massive ( representing @xmath26 of the total binary mass ) and the effective viscosity sufficiently strong ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "alternatively , general relativistic ( gr ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects may allow infalling matter to tap the spin energy of a bh via the blandford - znajek effect to produce an energetic jet @xcite . in this case , the crucial parameters to determine the energetics are the mass accretion rate and the spin of the bh .",
    "a review of grb models tapping spin energy can be found in @xcite .",
    "there has been a great deal of numerical work performed to study merging nsns binaries , including recent calculations performed using fully gr hydrodynamics and physically realistic nuclear equations of state ( eos ; @xcite ) . from these results ,",
    "two separate channels have been identified which could lead from a merger to the production of an sgrb .",
    "if the total binary mass is below some critical threshold , @xmath28 , a differentially rotating hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) can be formed that is initially stable against gravitational collapse , even though its mass is above the maximum value for uniformly rotating configurations @xcite . delayed gravitational collapse follows , triggered either by gravitational wave dissipation if the remnant forms a bar , or by magnetic redistribution of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations of shibata et al .  use a stiff , realistic eos @xcite , for which the maximum mass is slightly higher than the highest measured pulsar mass , @xmath29 for psr j0751 - 1807 @xcite .",
    "these simulations set a lower limit for the critical mass @xmath30 .",
    "this exceeds all known nsns binaries containing a radio pulsar , with the possible exception of psr 1913 + 16 ( @xmath31 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it appears that hmns formation is likely in most merging nsns binaries .",
    "mhd simulations in full gr show that the hmns undergoes a delayed collapse , resulting in a hot , magnetized torus surrounding a rotating bh , together with a magnetic field collimated along the polar axis .",
    "these conditions are favorable for a burst powered either by neutrino annihilation or mhd effects @xcite .    alternatively , for higher - mass nss",
    ", mergers with binary mass ratios sufficiently far from unity might lead to the formation of a relatively massive disk around a bh formed promptly during the merger @xcite . for mass ratios",
    "@xmath32 , disk masses of @xmath33 are possible , whereas more equal - mass mergers produce much lower mass disks , with insufficient thermal energy to power an sgrb @xcite .",
    "the key unanswered question for the hmns scenario is whether `` baryon pollution '' from merger ejecta along the polar axis can be cleared out of the funnel through which the presumed grb jet will propagate .",
    "relativistic numerical calculations @xcite indicate that mhd effects seem to be sufficient to accomplish this task , producing baryon densities along the polar axis that satisfy the constraints described in @xcite . for the unequal - mass nsns merger case ,",
    "the polar axis is essentially free of intervening matter , but the likelihood of this scenario depends on how far from unity binary mass ratios are likely to fall , as all observed systems containing radio pulsars have @xmath34 .",
    "systems with components too close together in mass produce significantly lower mass disks , which lack the required neutrino luminosity to power the sgrb @xcite .",
    "the defining parameter for determining the qualitative evolution of a bhns merger is the binary mass ratio @xmath35 . assuming that the tidal disruption of the ns begins at a separation @xmath36 where its volume in isolation is equal to the volume of its roche lobe , @xmath37 for a ns of compactness @xmath38 , using geometrized units with @xmath39 . for a sufficiently large bh ( and thus small @xmath40 ) @xmath36 is smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) @xmath41 , so that the ns passes through the isco before being disrupted tidally . for a typical ns of compactness @xmath42",
    "the critical mass ratio at which tidal disruption occurs at @xmath43 is approximately @xmath44 .",
    "it has been argued that even for this `` fiducial '' binary the rapid plunge timescale at the isco might prevent significant disk formation @xcite .",
    "our simulations suggest , however , that rapid angular momentum transfer during tidal disruption ejects a significant fraction of the matter back outside the isco , leading to a sizable disk . clearly , a detailed understanding of this dynamical process requires an accurate description of the strong field bhns spacetime , as we discuss below .",
    "we performed 3 + 1-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) calculations of bhns mergers in the conformal flatness ( cf ) approximation to gr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fbstr ) . for a schwarzschild bh",
    ", our scheme identifies including the relativistic isco exactly and accounts for relativistic dynamics within the isco , unlike previous pseudo - newtonian calculations @xcite .",
    "we adopt the relativistic , irrotational binary models of @xcite as initial data .",
    "our adiabatic evolution scheme is the same as that described in fbstr , but we solve the coupled non - linear elliptic field equations of the cf scheme using an iterative fft - convolution based solver and add artificial viscosity to the hydrodynamical equations in order to study the shock heating of the material during the merger process ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "both the initial data and the evolution scheme represent the state - of - the - art for including ns self - gravity self - consistently within a gr hydrodynamical formalism .",
    "we consider two models , both containing @xmath45 polytropic ns .",
    "first is a ns of compactness @xmath46 , denoted `` case a '' . as in fbstr ,",
    "our current method is limited to extreme mass ratios , so we choose @xmath47 , for which @xmath48 according to eq .",
    "[ eq : ar ] .",
    "we can not directly simulate the fiducial case ( @xmath44 , @xmath42 ) under these assumptions , so we take an alternate approach for our second calculation .",
    "simultaneously reducing the mass ratio to @xmath47 and the ns compactness to @xmath49 leaves @xmath50 virtually unchanged . from the argument above , this binary , denoted `` case b '' should tidally disrupt slightly within the isco , mimicking the dynamics of the fiducial binary .",
    "the evolution of case a is straightforward and probably uninteresting as an sgrb source : the entire ns spirals toward the bh , and no matter is ejected outside the isco to form an accretion disk .",
    "case b , on the other hand , does lead to the formation of an accretion disk , as we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : xyz ] . note that radii are measured in isotropic coordinates , in which the bh radius is @xmath51 and the isco radius @xmath52 .",
    "we see that while the ns inspirals until @xmath53 of its mass lies within the isco , rapid redistribution of angular momentum during tidal disruption causes an outwardly directed spiral arm to form , sending some matter back outside the isco .",
    "eventually , the bh accretes @xmath54 directly , while part of the remaining mass forms a disk of mass @xmath55 and part is ejected completely from the system ( @xmath56 ) . here",
    "we distinguish bound and unbound trajectories by the sign of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the time - component of the matter 4-velocity , which remains nearly constant in time for outflowing gas on approximately geodesic trajectories .",
    "we note that this configuration satisfies all the geometric constraints required for a grb progenitor , as all matter lies in the equatorial plane rather than the polar axis .",
    "the bound matter in the disk is relatively cold at first , as the matter in the arm is initially ejected without strong shock heating . over time , this disk generates heat via shocks as matter falls back and wraps around the bh forming a torus out to a radius of @xmath59 within @xmath60 ; ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz2 ] ) .",
    "the specific internal energy in the inner part of the torus corresponds to a temperature @xmath61 ; ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rhoeps ] ) .",
    "the surface density in this region is @xmath62 .",
    "assuming an opacity @xmath63 @xcite , we conclude that the disk is optically thick out to @xmath64 . using the diffusion limit ,",
    "the neutrino flux is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of neutrino families , and @xmath67 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the neutrino luminosity is @xmath68 .",
    "this value is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that seen in the collapse of an hmns @xcite , and should produce at least a comparable annihilation luminosity , @xmath69 .    qualitatively , the hot torus described here is similar both to the initial data used to study hydrodynamic disk evolution in earlier grb models @xcite , as well as to that formed by the collapse of an hmns @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the torus described here is physically larger . unlike previous pseudo - newtonian calculations of bhns mergers @xcite , we find prompt disruption of the ns during the plunge ( rather than a ns core which survives the initial mass loss phase ) and a lower mass disk , but at a temperature similar to those calculations which included a detailed microphysical treatment @xcite .",
    "while we do not follow the long - term evolution of the accretion torus and surrounding material , we can estimate the fallback time for the bound component , assuming geodesic orbits .",
    "approximately @xmath70 should return back toward the bh on timescales equal to or longer than a second , which could in principle produce lower - energy bursts at later times .",
    "it is conceivable that this fallback accretion might explain the secondary x - ray flares observed in sgrbs many seconds after the initial burst ( see @xcite for a summary of the observations ) , especially if self - gravity leads to the formation of higher density clumps of material , but further simulations are required to establish this identification .",
    "future observations should help to determine which progenitor candidates are responsible for the observed short grb population .",
    "gravitational wave measurements would provide important evidence if detected in coincidence : a grb resulting from hypermassive collapse would occur noticeably delayed relative to the gravitational wave signal from the inspiral and plunge phases of nearly equal - mass objects , whereas one resulting from a bhns binary would occur almost immediately after the signal from a very unequal - mass merger .",
