    "hierarchical models of cosmic structure formation predict that the first collapsed , luminous objects ( often referred to as pop  iii ) should form at redshift @xmath6 and have a total ( dark + baryonic ) mass @xmath7 ( couchman & rees 1986 , ciardi & ferrara 1997 , haiman 1997 , tegmark 1997 , ferrara 1998 , ciardi 1999 [ cfgj ] , nishi & susa 1999 ) .",
    "these properties are typically derived by requiring that the cooling time , @xmath8 , of the gas is shorter than the hubble time , @xmath9 , at the formation epoch , but as we will see later ( see cfgj for a thorough discussion ) several feedback effects could modify this conclusion . particularly important is the correct treatment of the molecular hydrogen formation / destruction network , this molecule being the only efficient coolant for objects close to the above mass scale",
    ".    as the collapse proceeds , the gas density increases and the first stars are likely to be formed . however , the final product of such star formation activity is presently quite unknown .",
    "this uncertainty largely depends on our persisting ignorance on the fragmentation process and on its relationship with the thermodynamical conditions of the gas .",
    "ultimately , this prevents firm conclusions on the mass spectrum of the formed stars or their imf to be drawn . in the last two decades",
    "this problem has been tackled intermittently ( silk 1977 ; kashlinsky & rees 1983 ; palla , salpeter & stahler 1983 ; carr 1984 , carr 1994 , uehara 1996 , omukai & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "these studies , however , could not converge to the same conclusion on the typical mass range of newly formed stars in the first protogalactic objects .",
    "roughly speaking , two possibilities have been proposed : either ( i ) very massive objects ( vmos ) , i.e. , single stars with mass in the range @xmath10 ( or even larger ) could be formed , or ( ii ) a more common stellar cluster , slightly biased towards low - mass stars , would emerge ( or some combination of the two involving low - mass star coalescence to form a vmo ) .",
    "early studies ( fricke , 1973 , el eid 1983 ; ober 1983 ) of the physics of vmos were left almost unfollowed in the literature , probably because observational evidences of the vmo hypothesis were lacking in the local universe .",
    "the field has recently been rejuvenated by observations , as the pistol star ( figer 1998 ) a vmo with mass @xmath11 and about 1 myr old , and calculations ( collected in the review by larson 1998 ) indicating that at earlier times the imf was top - heavy and that vmos could be a plausible outcome of the process .",
    "this possibility would bear tremendously important consequences for the reionization and metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium , as well as for galaxy formation and the nature of the dark matter .",
    "we propose here a test of the vmo hypothesis based on the detection of the gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted during the collapse into very massive black holes in the late phases of their evolution .",
    "the extreme assumption is made that the stellar population of pop iii objects is entirely made of vmos with mass proportional to their parent object .",
    "this allows to estimate an upper limit to the cumulative gw signal from vmos and to compare it with existing or forthcoming experimental apparatus ( virgo , ligo , lisa ) .",
    "this proposal is an ideal development of the original suggestion by thorne ( 1978 ) and carr , bond & arnett ( 1984 ) made possible by an improved understanding of structure formation , properties of early objects and their gw emission mechanisms .",
    "the method adopted here presents some similarities to the one outlined in ferrari , matarrese & schneider ( 1999 ) , although that work concentrated on the stochastic gw background produced by the core - collapse of standard supernovae at relatively low redshift .",
    "the gas in a forming galaxy is initially virialized in the potential well of the parent dark matter halo and ignition of star formation is possible only if the gas can efficiently cool and loose pressure support . for a plasma of primordial composition at temperature @xmath12 k , the typical virial temperature of the early bound structures , molecular hydrogen is the only efficient coolant .",
    "thus , a minimum fraction @xmath13 is required for the gas to cool ( tegmark 1997 ) .",
    "as this value is typically more than 100 times the intergalactic relic h@xmath14 abundance , it is necessary to study in detail the formation efficiency during the collapse phase .",
    "the condition @xmath15 is met only by relatively large halos implying that for each virialization redshift there will exist some critical , redshift dependent mass , @xmath16 , such that only protogalaxies with total mass @xmath17 can eventually form stars .",
    "we can then associate to each pop iii object with @xmath18 , a corresponding baryonic collapsed mass equal to @xmath19 . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a value of the baryon density parameter @xmath20 .    however , this is only half of the story .",
    "in fact , photons from the first stars with energies in the lyman - werner band and above the lyman limit , respectively , can photodissociate h@xmath14 molecules and ionize h and he atoms in the surrounding igm .",
    "this is the so - called _ radiative feedback _ which suppresses the formation of objects more massive than @xmath16 but with mass below @xmath21 .",
    "the latter mass scale corresponds to the minimum total mass required for an object to self - shield from an external flux of intensity @xmath22 at the lyman limit .",
    "the dissociating flux is the sum of two separate contributions : the first is coming from the background radiation produced by all luminous sources at a given redshift ; the second comes instead from the direct flux of neighbor objects .",
    "the relative importance of the two depends on cosmic epoch .",
    "the detailed calculation of @xmath21 is rather complicated but it is fully described in cfgj ; hence we do not repeat it here .",
    "proto - galaxies with virial temperatures @xmath23  k , corresponding to a mass @xmath24=@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the redshift of virialization , for which cooling via ly@xmath27 line radiation is possible are not affected by the radiative feedback and are assumed to form stars unimpeded .",
    "these results are graphically shown in fig .",
    "for example , at @xmath28 , it is @xmath29 , depending on the value of @xmath22 .",
    "however , those results should be applied with a caveat to the presently analyzed situation in which the luminosity in the early universe - and hence the radiative feedback - is dominated by vmos rather than by standard stars with a salpeter imf as assumed by cfgj .",
    "the main problem is that the emission spectrum of vmos in not known ( although it is currently under investigation [ chiosi , private communication ] ) and therefore the feedback effect can not be calculated entirely self - consistently . to alleviate the problem , though",
    ", we note that cfgj concluded that the results are poorly sensitive to the exact form of the spectrum as long as it is of a soft , stellar type .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the evolution of the vmo initial mass function , @xmath30 , deduced from the simulations by cfgj in which all above effects have been included , for three different redshifts .",
    "these results have been obtained for a critical density cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( @xmath31=1 , @xmath32=0.5 with @xmath33=0.6 at @xmath34=0 ) ; as a consequence all the results presented here refer to the same cosmological model .",
    "the mass of the vmo is here determined as @xmath35 , with a baryon - to - star efficiency conversion @xmath36 .",
    "as expected the mass distribution shifts towards larger masses with time , but smaller masses can not form because of the collapse conditions imposed . together with the vmo imf , we can directly calculate their formation rate from the curves given in fig .",
    "11 of cfgj which we do not repeat here .",
    "a great deal of uncertainty obviously remains on the upper mass limit of vmos .",
    "as the mass of the parent pop iii object becomes larger , it is increasingly difficult for the gas to collapse preventing fragmentation into lower mass stars ( see however silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , conditions could be suitable for the steady growth of a massive star through collisions with other intermediate mass stars .",
    "there is now substantial amount of theoretical work on this subject , mostly for the formation of relatively massive stars ( @xmath37 ) in the local universe and neglecting the effects of a massive dark matter halo as the one in which pop iii objects are embedded ( bonnell , bate & zinnecker 1998 , portegies zwart 1999 ) .",
    "the central vmo in the pop iii cluster is then `` rejuvenated '' by each new collision , and its lifetime is extended considerably as a consequence .",
    "when does this vmo mass build - up process come to an end ?",
    "the usual argument based on the idea that radiation pressure from the vmo finally removes the gas producing the cluster expansion with consequent decrease of the stellar collision rate is probably not appropriate in this context as the gravitational field ( dominated by the dark halo ) would be only very weakly affected .",
    "also , radiation pressure might have been much less important in the absence of heavy elements .",
    "what are the possible fates of vmos ?",
    "the answer depends essentially on their mass .",
    "here we are interested in objects with @xmath38 , the span of the imf in fig .",
    "2 . stars more massive than about 100 @xmath39 are pair - production unstable ( fowler & hoyle 1964 ) .",
    "this process may lead to ( portinari 1998 ) _",
    "i ) _ violent pulsation instability with final iron core instability , _ ii ) _ complete thermonuclear explosion , or _",
    "iii ) _ collapse to a black hole .",
    "iii ) _ , the one of interest here , occurs for masses @xmath40 ( but rotation might increase this value , glatzel 1985 ) . at higher masses ( @xmath41 )",
    "the evolution depends on metallicity , @xmath42 ( fricke 1973 , fuller 1986 ) : if @xmath43 the star collapses to a black hole due to post - newtonian instabilities without ignition of the hydrogen burning ; for higher metallicities it explodes since it could generate nuclear energy more rapidly from the @xmath44-limited cycle .",
    "the former case appears to be appropriate here , as the metallicity level produced by reionization is only @xmath45 ( cfgj ) , and likely to be even smaller if the nucleosynthetic products are swallowed by black holes .",
    "these conclusions are based on the detailed simulations by fuller ( 1986 ) which extend up to stellar masses @xmath46 .",
    "it has to be pointed out that if some fraction of dark matter is present ( at the level of about 0.1%-1% of the vmo central density ) , the onset of post - newtonian instability can be delayed and the hydrogen burning ignited ; however , this _ favors _ the collapse to a black hole rather than the explosion , as shown by mclaughlin & fuller ( 1996 ) .",
    "above @xmath47 the study is tremendously complicated by the necessity of taking into account general relativity effects which can influence the stability and evolution of these stars .",
    "little is know about supermassive objects although promising investigations are underway ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 , baumgarte , shapiro & shibata 1999 ) . in order not to add additional uncertainty sources to our calculation _",
    "our main results are limited to vmos with @xmath48_. however , because of the interesting nature of these objects based on the preliminary findings of baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ) , we will also discuss separately the gw signal produced by the largest objects present in the derived vmo imf .",
    "the properties of the gravitational radiation emitted during the stellar collapse to a black hole have been extensively investigated during the past 20 years ( see ferrari & palomba 1998 for a recent review ) . the gravitational energy is released in a short initial broad - band burst with efficiency @xmath49 so that the total gravitational energy emitted is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mass of the newly formed hole ( thorne 1986 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath49 found both in pertubative approaches and in fully numerical simulations came out quite low .",
    "for an axisymmetric collapse , the efficiency is less than @xmath52 ( stark & piran 1985 ) .",
    "however , if the star is rotating sufficiently rapidly to undergo a dynamical bar mode instability prior to forming the black hole , then the energy released in gravitational waves can be substantially higher ( smith , houser & centrella 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , the collapse of a vmo promises to be a very interesting source for gravitational wave detection .    for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the gravitational energy released during each collapse , @xmath53 , is emitted in a broad - band burst centered at a frequency , @xmath54 , which corresponds to a wavelength of order 10 times the schwarzschild radius , @xmath55 , associated to the hole ( thorne 1978 , carr , bond & arnett 1984 )",
    ". the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted during the collapse can be approximated to a lorenzian , = [ eq : single ] where @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the typical duration of the burst , @xmath58 is the normalization , @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 the maximum frequency emitted by the source . while the available theoretical waveforms are too uncertain to warrant a more elaborate analysis , this crude approximation well highlights the main features and assumptions of the model .    the average gravitational flux emitted by a source at a distance @xmath62 can be easily shown to be , = d= . for sources at cosmological distances , the above expression can be immediately generalized to , = , [ eq : mean ] where @xmath63 is the redshifted emission frequency , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "if the final fate of vmos is to collapse , leaving very massive black hole ( vmbh ) remnants , then the overall effect of the gravitational waves emitted during each collapse would be seen today as a stochastic background .",
    "the signal produced by these events can be computed integrating the gravitational signal contributed by each source over the differential source formation rate , [ ] = dz dm ( m , z ) , where @xmath66 is the vmo cosmic formation rate per comoving volume obtained from the cfgj simulations .",
    "the spectral energy density allows the evaluation of the corresponding spectral strain amplitude , s_h [ ] = [ ] . clearly , the relevant parameters which determine the amplitude and the location of the signal are the efficiency @xmath49 and the fraction of the initial mass which participates to the collapse , @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath68 , as well as its dependence on @xmath69 , is very uncertain . for an axisymmetric collapse , only about 10% of the initial stellar mass collapses to the final black hole ( stark & piran 1985 ) .",
    "however , baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ) suggest that for @xmath70 , only a few percent of the initial mass is left outside of the black hole , most likely in the form of a disk . thus , it is not unreasonable to assume that @xmath68 may vary in the range 0.1 - 0.9 ( see also carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) .    the stochastic background signal predicted by our model is shown in fig . [ fig3 ] for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "there we compare the spectral energy density produced by pre - galactic vmbhs to the more recent contribution from core - collapse sne at @xmath73 ( see ferrari , matarrese & schneider 1999 ) . due to their larger masses ,",
    "the gravitational signal from the birth of vmbhs falls at much shorter wavelengths than that produced by core - collapse sne .    in spite of their great distances ,",
    "pre - galactic vmos produce a background signal which adds , as a confusion noise component , to the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve in the range @xmath74 hz ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) , for the parameters assumed in the model .",
    "thus , we expect that _ lisa _ will be able to place an upper limit on the intensity of the pop iii background signal in this frequency range .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we also show a crude estimate of the signal produced by vmos with masses @xmath75 which undergo a dynamical bar instability before the final implosion .",
    "this possibility has been recently discussed by baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ) .",
    "they investigated the secular evolution of supermassive stars ( smss ) with masses @xmath75 , up to the onset of the instability .",
    "the gravitational efficiency of the collapse as well as the detailed waveforms of the resulting signal can be definitely assessed only with a numerical , three - dimensional hydrodynamics simulation in general relativity ( baumgarte , shapiro & shibata 1999 ) .",
    "however , based on simple arguments , these authors suggest that the collapsing star may form a nonaxisymmetric bar before it forms a black hole .",
    "numerical simulations of the dynamical bar mode instability in compact stellar cores with stiff equation of state ( @xmath76 ) have shown that a burst of gravitational radiation is emitted with an efficiency @xmath49 ranging between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , depending on the initial equatorial radius of the bar , @xmath79 , and on the polytropic index ( houser & centrella 1996 ) .",
    "the burst is centered at a frequency @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the rotation frequency of the bar , @xmath82 the width of the gravitational burst depends sensitively on the polytropic index : stiffer models undergo several episodes of bar formation and recontraction , emitting a sequence of bursts of decreasing amplitude .",
    "the structure of smss with @xmath70 is that of an @xmath83 polytrope ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ) and it is reasonable to assume that the radiation emitted would be concentrated in a single burst of width @xmath80 .",
    "following baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ) we assume , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the polar radius at the onset of the bar instability . with these parameters , we model the spectrum emitted by a vmo with @xmath86 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : single ] ) and ( [ eq : mean ] ) with an efficiency @xmath87 and @xmath72 .    as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , these objects produce a significant signal at frequencies @xmath88hz , too small to be detectable with _",
    "lisa_.      the rate of vmbh formation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as a function of redshift .",
    "the total number of vmbhs formed per unit time is @xmath89 events / yr . the ratio of the duration of each burst to the separation between successive bursts , i.e. the duty cycle , = dm ( m , z ) is also shown in fig.[fig5 ] as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that the overlap condition , @xmath90 , is not satisfied even if we consider all vmos out to the farthest @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we find , contrary to previous claims ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) , that vmbhs that originate from pop iii stars do not generate an overlapping background but rather a stationary , discrete sequence of bursts , i.e. a shot - noise signal ( see also ferrari , matarrese & schneider 1999 ) .",
    "thus , though a stochastic background at comparable frequencies and amplitude might have been generated in the very early universe , it would still be possible to disentagle any pop iii gravitational signature through this peculiar shot - noise character .",
    "we have investigated the gravitational wave emission from the collapse of very massive objects formed in the early universe .",
    "the presence of such objects would bear tremendously important consequences for the intergalactic medium reionization , the generation of the first metals and for their contribution to the dark matter in the universe .    the predicted spectral strain amplitude in a critical density cdm universe peaks in the frequency range @xmath0  hz where it has a value in the range @xmath91  hz@xmath2 , which is above the _ lisa _ sensitivity curve .",
    "the expected emission event rate is roughly 4000 events / yr , resulting in a stationary , discrete sequence of bursts , a shot  noise signal . the issue of the actual detectability of our signal by _",
    "lisa _ is more complex , as cross - correlation techniques , which would be needed to disentangle a stochastic background from the noise , can not be applied here ( see , e.g. flanagan & hughes 1998 ) .",
    "so , any background would actually add as a confusion limited noise component to the _ lisa _ instrumental noise . in this sense",
    "_ lisa _ will place an upper limit to the amplitude of our signal . on the other hand",
    ", the predicted stochastic background has a shot - noise structure , similarly to the background produced , in the high frequency bandwidth , by the core - collapse to black holes in standard supernovae at @xmath92 ( ferrari , matarrese & schneider 1999 , see fig .",
    "thus , standard detection techniques , which have been developed for continuous stochastic signals , can be applied only if the integration time of the antenna is much longer than the typical separation between two successive bursts ( of the order of a few hours for the present study ) .",
    "specific techniques should be investigated in order to assess how far the shot - noise structure can be exploited to help the detection or , at least , to distinguish the signal from the instrumental noise or from continuous backgrounds contributing in the same band .",
    "our underlying assumption that down to @xmath93 fragmentation in collapsing cosmological objects is inhibited by the absence of metals ( and therefore only very massive stars are formed ) is clearly strong and , at present , untestable , but yet not an unreasonable one .",
    "its motivation is that it allows to estimate an upper limit to the expected gravitational wave emission from this population of astrophysical objects .",
    "the growth of the metallicity level in the universe not only favors fragmentation of the gas , but also quenches the formation of vmbhs as these objects tend to explode , as discussed in sec .",
    "2 . for these reasons",
    ", the gw contribution from collapsing vmos can only come from redshifts higher than approximately 10 .",
    "some details of the calculation are uncertain , as for example the exact shape of the gw emission spectrum from a collapsing vmo .",
    "however , a different choice of the spectrum ( the one suggested by stark & piran 1985 ) produces only a slight difference in the integrated spectral energy distribution .",
    "indeed , the expected signal could be even higher than what predicted here if the conversion efficiency of the total gravitational energy into gws is higher than the value @xmath77 used here , as suggested by some previous studies ( the amplitude of the gw signal is @xmath94 ) .",
    "detecting a gw signal from vmos will become possible with the new class of gw detectors as _ lisa _ , according to our predictions .",
    "this would allow to directly test epochs and objects which would be otherwise difficult to reach with other instruments , at best for a very long time .",
    "this experiment could also provide stringent limits to the cosmic star formation history at redshifts @xmath95 and to investigate the physics and properties of the first stars in the universe .",
    "the remnants of such primordial objects could still be present in halos of galaxies like our own ( for an excellent review see carr 1994 ) .",
    "the type of bh remnants discussed here are interesting dark matter candidates : gravitational lensing effects measured from the line - to - continuum variation of quasars suggest that the lensing objects in the intervening galaxies have a mass in the range @xmath96 ( subramanian & chitre 1987 ) .",
    "however , the upper end of this interval might be constrained to be @xmath97 by either dynamical ( heating of disk stars , lacey & ostriker 1985 ) or luminosity ( accretion of gas in the halos of galaxies , ipser & price 1977 ; hegyi 1986 ) constraints .",
    "interestingly enough , this interval appears not only to well match the predicted vmo imf ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , but also to provide a gw signal which might be detectable by _ lisa_."
