    "in the following sections , we provide a detailed introduction to the methods used to derive the results presented above , and discuss some of the more complex , less intuitive notions applied in this article . the following topics are presented :    1.1 ) * the three qubits raman transition scheme for ec * 1.2 ) * ec in the strong noise limit * 1.3 ) * spin spin interactions scheme * 1.4 ) * simulation of the sorenson - molmer scheme * 1.5 ) * red side band schemes * + 2 ) * multiple level systems for ec and sensing * 2.1 ) * a general application scheme * 2.2 ) * flip - flops where both spins dissipate * + 3 ) * the generality of @xmath70 noise * 3.1 ) * proving the generality statements * + 4 ) * methods for nv center schemes *      here we provide a detailed explanation of the ec mechanism presented in the prolonging @xmath70 section above , for the raman transition between the two three - qubits states @xmath133 and @xmath134 through the intermediate state @xmath135 .",
    "the transition is carried out by lasers shone on the qubits , under the assumption that transition to the @xmath136 state has been suppressed by the creation of a large energy gap from this state .",
    "the key parameters are the two rabi frequencies @xmath137 and the detuning of the two lasers ( which are identical ) @xmath138 .",
    "note that the population of the intermediate state ( @xmath139 ) is proportional to @xmath140 .",
    "let us assume that , at some time t , we reach the following state : @xmath141 a photon is emitted , resulting in : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the fast rotating phase of the middle raman state , and we assume that the emission of the photon is fast relative to the sensing hamiltonian .    to correct this we measure the spin correlation operator @xmath80 : if the first two qubits turn out to be in the same state , we make the correction : @xmath144@xmath145 , @xmath146 , otherwise we make : @xmath147 , @xmath148 and thus we get : @xmath149 or @xmath150 because the times between subsequent decays varies , and since @xmath151 , the phase @xmath143 is essentially random , resulting in a random walk of @xmath84 in 2d , i.e. : @xmath152 and @xmath153 where m is the number of measurement circles until time t , and @xmath154 is the size of one step .",
    "the factor 2 comes from the dimensionality of the random walk .    from this",
    "we get the std ( standard deviation ) of @xmath155 .",
    "note that the random walk also occurs when no dissipation is measured , so we have @xmath156 .",
    "now we define @xmath157 , the ( new ) decoherence time with ec , as the time after which @xmath84 can now longer be separated from the induced noise , that is @xmath158 .",
    "this yields @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "as seen above , due to the raman transition rotation frequency @xmath87 , the new accuracy is @xmath161 up to a factor of the order of unity .      in a frequency measurement",
    ", we can achieve the sensitivity of @xcite : @xmath162 as function of the measurement time . to find the optimal time we look for a time such that @xmath93 .",
    "this will give us essentially @xmath94 as can be seen in @xcite , where t is the total experiment time and n is the number of , simultaneously running , separate systems , but , in the strong noise regime , @xmath163 .",
    "in other words , we can only work in the @xmath164 regime , where @xmath165 by substituting in [ [ dg_of_t_sup ] ] we get @xmath166 differentiating according to t and solving gives us @xmath167 .",
    "since we can not prolong the measurement for so long , we will choose the longest time possible , i.e. @xmath168 giving us : @xmath169 this is not good since it increases the error by factor @xmath170    if we use the three - qubits - scheme for error correction described above in this system , we reduce the frequency to the new @xmath171 , but we can prolong the decoherence , getting @xmath172 . specifically we have @xmath173 and thus can choose @xmath174 and so we go back to the conditions at the beginning of this section , once again achieving the sensitivity described in eq.[[dg_of_t_sup ] ] , but with new parameters : @xmath175 where we replaced the old @xmath70 of the system to the @xmath157 of the corrected system , and plugged in the raman transition frequency instead of the simple system s g.    now , as implied above , we can choose @xmath176 so that @xmath177 noting that @xmath178 ( since we assume @xmath179 ) , we get the accuracy @xmath180 just as in @xcite . checking the relative accuracy",
    "we get : @xmath181",
    "we describe in detail error corrections when measuring filp - flop type interaction .",
    "the code we need to correct is : @xmath182 , @xmath183 where the first qubit is subject to @xmath70 noise ( i.e. dissipation ) , and the signal flip - flops between this qubit and a second good qubit , that is : @xmath184 where @xmath185 are the pauli operators .",
    "the third qubit is an auxiliary good qubit .",
    "the hamiltonian in the code space , is : @xmath186 which induces rotation between the two code states .",
    "suppose we reach the following state : @xmath187 and then a dissipation takes place , with amplitude @xmath188 ( where @xmath189 ) , bringing us to the state : @xmath190\\right)\\otimes{|0_{ph}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] now we measure the operator @xmath191 ( @xmath192 is the spin , in the z direction , of the i - th qubit ) , thus casting the code into the state ( up to normalization ) : @xmath193 or @xmath194\\right)\\otimes{|0_{ph}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] in the first case , the error can be corrected by the pulses @xmath195 and @xmath196 in the second case another measurement is needed ; specifically measuring the operator @xmath197 will transform the state into either : @xmath198 or @xmath199 and in both cases completing the correction should be straight forward .",
    "another possibility for ec while sensing flip - flops is to use ramsey interferometry , for example in the following scheme . for the code",
    "we use three qubits .",
    "the first qubit state is denoted by @xmath200 , this qubit is undergoing dissipation .",
    "the second qubit , whose state is denoted by @xmath201 is a good qubit .",
    "flip - flops occur between the first and the second qubits .",
    "the third qubit is a good auxiliary qubit whose state is denoted by @xmath202 .",
    "the hamiltonian will take the form of @xmath203    the code will be : @xmath204 and we get the sensing @xmath205 which allows for ramsey interferometry for measuring @xmath8 .",
    "for the measurement , apply a field @xmath206 where @xmath207 is well - known .",
    "note that this field works only on the third qubit .",
    "apply @xmath208 for a @xmath209 pulse on state @xmath210 , then wait while making error corrections ( every @xmath41 seconds ) for time t , then apply @xmath208 for another @xmath209 pulse . measuring the probability of being in state @xmath211",
    "will give the expected cosine signal .",
    "ec procedure : assume we start in the state @xmath212 .",
    "a dissipation occurs on the first bit , taking us to : @xmath213\\otimes\\vert 0_{ph}\\rangle .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] by measuring the ( local ) operators @xmath214 and @xmath197 we can separate the system to @xmath215 or @xmath216 or @xmath217 where @xmath218 fits the measurement results of @xmath219 , and so forth . from here",
    "correcting is straight forward .",
    "the only errors left are from the evolution @xmath220 occurring during the dissipation process , which are second order in the noise parameter , giving us @xmath221 .",
    "the graph depicts the dephasing time with error correction ( @xmath1 ) of the sorenson molmer simulation system , estimated from the simulation as a function of @xmath222 and of @xmath223 ( in the inset ) . here",
    "@xmath70 is the original decay rate of the system ( i.e. without ec ) .",
    "the illustrated curves are described by the formula @xmath224 a qualitative agreement can be seen .",
    "note that although @xmath41 does not appear in the final formula , the formula is only valid in the @xmath225 limit [ ms1 ]    the sorenson molmer scheme we proposed is not as simple as it might appear , since it involves a raman transition through a state which is outside the code . here , unlike the original scheme , the ec sequence do not induce an error every time ( this is why this scheme works better ) .",
    "nevertheless , every time an emission of a photon is measured , a small error is induced through the correction sequence ; in essence this error occurs since we send the population of the intermediate state to 0 .",
    "as the intermediate state is a fast oscillating state , whose phase relative to the other states depends on initial conditions , we assumed that each such correction would effectively send the system to the beginning of the last oscillation cycle of the intermediate state , causing a @xmath226 delay ( this happens on average every @xmath70 , resulting in the very small change of @xmath227 which can be accounted for exactly ) .",
    "also we assumed that every time we decay , and correct that decay , we effectively lose half the time since last ec sequence , as this is the average time in the lower state in which the sensing hamiltonian does not operate .",
    "in addition , we note that the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are of the form @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which are populated in the raman transition process , and @xmath230 .",
    "this latter state should only have a population of order @xmath154 , and any excessive population means that the population is trapped in the intermediate @xmath139 state and causes degradation of the signal .",
    "for this reason we had to assume that the ec does not cause a population transfer to this last state .",
    "all these assumptions were validated by simulation .",
    "a typical output is visualized in fig .",
    "[ ms ] in the paper , showing that ec vastly increases the accuracy .    furthermore , in fig .",
    "[ ms1 ] , the dependency of the system s @xmath157 on different parameters is shown , as calculated from the results of the simulation .",
    "the fit is rather crude and bears only qualitative resemblance to the expected @xmath231 curve .",
    "this can be attributed to four factors : 1 ) given our limited resources , each point on the graph shows the average over the results of only a few runs , rather than few thousands , as ideally it should .",
    "2 ) the actual results depend to a great extent on the number of times in which the emission of a photon was actually detected 3 ) @xmath157 were only estimated up to a factor of order unity rather than calculated exactly 4 ) higher order contributions were ignored when calculating the expected result .",
    "dissipation takes place on the first bit . by setting @xmath232",
    "we have the typical state of @xmath233 and , in the fast ecs limit , dissipation bring us to : @xmath234 it should be possible to design a measurement that will separate the state , depending on the measurement outcome , in to : @xmath235 or @xmath236 or @xmath237    correcting this will amount to reducing the effective measurement time by @xmath238 in the last case , and to errors of order @xmath239 which is third order .",
    "in other words , we achieved enlarged @xmath1 and enhanced precision , as was also validated by the simulation presented in the previous section .",
    "in this paper we mainly assumed that we were dealing with physical qubits ; i.e. each distinct qubit is also a distinct atom , spinor or , ion ( and so forth ) .",
    "the main implication of this assumption is some loss of generality in the possible relation of the sensing hamiltonian to the error model : for example , when we say ( under prolonging @xmath70  ) that the most obvious way to connect two states which are more than one step apart is a raman transition , we are obviously referring to some natural , physical , partition of the qubits .",
    "if we have two states say , @xmath240 and @xmath241 connected by some field , we can always denote @xmath242 and @xmath243 and now the same field connects these two seemingly very different states .",
    "of course , such notions are superficial and only cause confusion because they have no real implications , since the errors will now also connect very different states . in other words ,",
    "when we measure distances between code states we should really measure them relative to the possible errors . as we noted above , all qubits that are sensitive to the measured field",
    "must be also sensitive to errors ( otherwise we will use only good qubits and need no ec ) .",
    "this notion is always true , and this is why our physicality assumption is a very good one .",
    "nevertheless , when describing multilevel systems in terms of good and noisy qubits , a simple system might still need to be described by very complicated qubits structures .",
    "thus for some systems , the obvious error models might differ from the ones we refer to in this article .",
    "( changing the errors is interchangeable with changing the sensing hamiltonian as regards ec because the orthogonality relations between the two is all that matters ) .    in practice ,",
    "finding systems with error models which are correctable is not easy , as the added complexity of the systems tends to cause more evolved errors rather then simply different ones .",
    "still , the possibility exists , and two examples are given below .      one way to achieve better performance from our ec models",
    "is by using systems that decay to states other than the ground states . on the down side",
    ", such systems will undergo decay from all their subsequent states rather than only from the  up  state of the qubits . on the up side",
    ", each state will decay into a different orthogonal state , enabling additional freedom in separating and correcting the errors .",
    "we use atomic states in the example . denote @xmath244 and @xmath245 the decay is thus either @xmath246 or @xmath247 where all the different photons populations contribute to orthogonal states of the environment ; i.e. the decays resulting in different photons are not coherent .",
    "we will use a code made up of the two - atom states : @xmath248 the sensing hamiltonian will be @xmath249 which can be achieved by means of magnetic field in the @xmath250 direction , acting on each atom separately . note that the decay on different atoms is non - coherent in other words there are different phase - shifts for different atoms as well as for different decays .    starting with : @xmath251 a decay brings us to @xmath252 where @xmath253 are the amplitudes to emit the 4 respective possible distinct photons .",
    "measuring each atom s j value will either correct the errors or bring us ( w.l.o.g . ) , up to normalization , to :    @xmath254 now measuring the @xmath255 state of the first atom ( that is , its m value ) ; i.e. measuring in the @xmath256 basis , we get ( w.l.o.g . ) :    @xmath257 where now the photon number has no significance , and can be ignored",
    ". now make @xmath258 and @xmath259 and the error is fully corrected .",
    "note that this method , in fact , enables the measurement of generic magnetic field .",
    "this can be done by using multiple level systems .",
    "we use two prob atoms in the j=1 and j=0 states , and one good qubit in some other states @xmath256 . denote @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "we assume flip flops of the two qubits ( i.e. @xmath262 ) , both of which may undergo decay in the form : @xmath263 where the two modes of decay are non coherent , and the decays of different atoms are also non - coherent .",
    "we use the three - atom code :    @xmath264 starting with : @xmath265 a decay brings us to @xmath266 where @xmath253 are the amplitudes to emit the 4 respective possible distinct photons .",
    "measuring the j state of each atoms , we either correct the error or reach ( w.l.o.g . ) as the state : @xmath267 now , measuring the m state of the second atom brings us to : @xmath268 or @xmath269 where we have left out the photons , as they are now unimportant .",
    "correcting from here is straight forward .",
    "in the language of error correction it is customary to refer to two kinds of errors ; phase - flip ( i.e. errors proportional to the @xmath17 pauli operator ) and bit - flip ( i.e. @xmath270 errors ) .",
    "this is because these two errors are simple to comprehend , and span all possible errors , in the sense that if a bit - flip and a phase - flip can be corrected any general error can be corrected .",
    "these kind of codes are fully correctable and can be corrected for general errors.    specifically this means that in the former case we can also correct errors induced by decay .",
    "sometimes the converse is also held to be true , but it is not .",
    "below we demonstrate , by means of an example , that correcting decay errors does not require the power to correct any error",
    ". we also present and explain why one might , naively , believe the converse .    for clarity ,",
    "we define errors induced by decay ( also refereed to as @xmath70 errors ) .",
    "these errors are caused by coupling the system to the environment via the term @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the annihilation operator of the i - th mode of a of the environment .",
    "this error , when one traces - out the state of the cavity ( i.e. the environment ) , causes decoherence .",
    "the rate of the error is defined by the typical time scale , denoted @xmath70 , after which a decay is likely to occur . in what follows",
    "we will suppose , for simplicity , that the photon mode was originally found in the @xmath273 state .      to prove this consider the following eight qubit system , which can be corrected for bit - flip and @xmath70 errors on each qubit , but not for the effects of phase - flip errors .",
    "denote @xmath274 and @xmath275 we shell define our code states , and our initial state , to be : @xmath276    * bit -flip error * , occurring with amplitude @xmath277 bring us to , @xmath278 note that while we assume all qubits might have errors , we also assume that only one qubit eror at the same time ; that is , we assume that the probability of measuring an error is proportional to some small parameter ( and thus multiple simultaneous errors are second order ) .",
    "it is evident that this error can be corrected by measuring the adjacent - qubits correlation operators @xmath279 .",
    "two neighboring qubits with the same sign tells us that an error has occurred , as well as revealing its location .    * phase - flip errors *",
    ", however , can not be corrected , since a phase - flip on the the first four qubits coincides with the phase - flip on the last four , in a nasty way : @xmath280 which is @xmath281 and since the separation between the populations , that is a and b , was destroyed , the error can not be corrected .",
    "* decay errors * occurring on the first bit with amplitude @xmath154 , will bring us to the following state : @xmath282 now , if we allow for decay on any of the bits we get @xmath283 this error can be resolved , again , by measuring the two spins correlation functions . if , for example , we measure the second qubit to be the same as its neighbors , we necessarily arrived at the state @xmath284 which indeed enables us to correct the error . the correction from here is straight forward .",
    "now , let s assume that we measured no decay , that is , all the adjacent spin correlations turn out negative , in which case we reach the state : @xmath285 and thus the error has already been corrected .",
    "the conclusion is that since in this system it is possible to correct @xmath70 errors , but not phase - flip errors , then correcting @xmath70 errors is not equivalent to correcting any error ( that is , to correcting  general errors  ) .      despite the above demonstration , in many systems @xmath70 errors appear to be almost as bad as general errors ;",
    "in other words , they are almost as hard to correct .",
    "evidently , correction of @xmath70 errors implies the correction of bit - flip errors .",
    "in addition , since the error is a non hermitian @xmath113 error , it operates differently on the up and down states .",
    "thus , in order to correct it , the code states need to have the same probability for being in the up state of each qubit .",
    "that is , the code states can not differ in the probability of finding oneself in the up state of any of the qubits .",
    "suppose for example the following state : @xmath286 then a decay , occurring on the first bit for example , will take us to @xmath287 evidently , this can not be corrected . also take a look at the code states @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "this also is not correctable for the same reason , since the decay rate of each state is different , and thus each correction induces a @xmath290 relative factor .",
    "the next obvious system one might check is the following schors - like code : denote @xmath291 ; then the states are @xmath292 and @xmath293 assume a decay , for brevity of the first qubit only , and we get from @xmath294 the state @xmath295 by measuring the correlation operators it is easy to verify that a decay here is correctable . but look what happens when no decay was measured : one can write @xmath296 and thus we arrive at the state : @xmath297 this is a phase - flip and we know that phase - flips are not correctable in this system .",
    "it should be pointed out that this is only an  effective phase - flip  due to the structure of the system , since in our previous system no such phase - flip occurred .",
    "also note that in this system , apparently we need to be able to correct bit - flips , and subsequent bit and phase flips ( on the same qubit ) - when we measure decay .",
    "furthermore , we have to be able to correct phase - flip when no decay was measured .",
    "altogether this signifies a  general error  . misleading us to believe that @xmath70 errors are equivalent to general errors . note that the  effective phase - flip  appears only in second order in @xmath154 which is advantageous , since this is also the order of the non correctable  two bit - flips  errors",
    "in this section we present the error correction protocol applicable for both the models described in the article under classical drive noise and quantum noise . in both models , we presented the mapping of the physical space into code states , in eqs .",
    "(  [ code_classical ] ) and the error acts as a bit - flip that maps the states from the code space onto the error space . denoting by @xmath298 and @xmath299 the code states , the error operation will take these states to the states we denote by @xmath300 and @xmath301 , respectively .",
    "preparing the system in an initial state @xmath302 , the sensing part of the hamiltonian will take it , in time @xmath176 , to be @xmath303 and @xmath4 can be deduced by measuring the probability of the system will be still at the initial state , at time @xmath304 an error operation will take the system into the error states defined above .",
    "we now measure the hermitian operator @xmath305 which returns the eigenvalue @xmath65 if the system had no error and @xmath64 if a single error has occurred , without changing the state of system in either case ( up to a global irrelevant phase ) .",
    "having discovered that an error occurred , the state can be corrected by applying the a bit - flip operation .",
    "thus we have outlined a complete error correction protocol for both these models ."

    "<S> the red side - band interaction is applied on both the first and the second ions , resulting in a raman transition via the third state . </S>",
