    "stochastic semiclassical gravity ( stg ) is a theory developed in the nineties using semiclassical gravity ( scg , quantum fields in classical spacetimes , solved self - consistently ) as the starting point and aiming at a theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) as the goal .",
    "while semiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical einstein equation with the source given by the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor of quantum fields , stochastic gravity ( we will often use the shortened term _ stochastic gravity _ as there is no confusion in the source of stochasticity in gravity being due to quantum fields here , and not of a classical origin ) includes also its fluctuations in a new stochastic semiclassical or the einstein - langevin equation . if the centerpiece in semiclassical gravity theory is the vacuum expectation value of the stress - energy tensor of a quantum field , and the central issues being how well the vacuum is defined and how the divergences can be controlled by regularization and renormalization , the centerpiece in stochastic semiclassical gravity theory is the stress - energy bi - tensor and its expectation value known as the noise kernel .",
    "the mathematical properties of this quantity and its physical content in relation to the behavior of fluctuations of quantum fields in curved spacetimes are the central issues of this new theory .",

    "it is also a useful beachhead supported by well - established low energy ( sub - planckian ) physics to explore the connection with high energy ( planckian ) physics in the realm of quantum gravity .    in these lectures",

    "the second , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , is by functional methods .",
    "it is motivated by the observation @xcite that in some open quantum systems classicalization and decoherence @xcite on the system may be brought about by interaction with an environment . the environment being in this case the matter fields and some degrees of freedom of the quantum gravitational field @xcite .",
    "semiclassical gravity describes the interaccion of the gravitational field assumed to be a classical field with quantum matter fields .",
    "this theory can not be derived as a limit in a quantum theory of gravity , but can be formaly derived in several ways .",
    "one of them is the leading @xmath2 approximation of quatum gravity interacting with @xmath3 independent and identical free quantum fields @xcite .",
    "when one assumes that the fields interact with gravity only and keep the value of @xmath4 finite , where @xmath5 is newton s gravitational constant , one arrives at a theory in which formaly the gravitational field can be treated as a c - number ( i.e. quatized at tree level ) but matter fields are fully quatized .    in the semiclassical theory theory the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor in a given quantum state is the source of the gravitational field .",
    "this theory may be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be a globaly hyperbolic four - dimensional spacetime with metric @xmath7 and consider a real scalar quantum field @xmath8 of mass @xmath9 propagating on it ( we assume a scalar field for simplicity but this is not essential ) .",

    "the field may be quantized in the manifold using the standard canonical formalism @xcite .",
    "the field operator in the heisenberg reperesentation @xmath16 is an operator valued distribution solution of the klein - gordon equation , the field equation of eq .",

    "the next step is to define a stress - energy tensor operator @xmath24(x)$ ] .",
    "naively one would replace the classical field @xmath8 in the above functional by the quantum operator @xmath18 $ ] , but this procedure involves taking the product of two distributions at the same spacetime point .",
    "this is ill - defined and we need a regularization procedure .",
    "there are several regularization methods which one may use , one is the point - splitting or point - separation regularizaton method in which one introduces a point @xmath25 in a neighborhood of the point @xmath26 and then uses as a regulator the vector tangent at the point @xmath26 of the geodesic joining @xmath26 and @xmath25 ; this method is discussed in detail in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "another well known method is dimesional regularization in which one works in arbitray @xmath27 dimensions , where @xmath27 is not necessarily an integer , and then uses as the regulator the parameter @xmath28 ; this method is used in this section and in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the regularized stress - energy operator using the weyl ordering prescription , _",
    "i.e. _ symmetrical ordering , can be written as ^[g ] = 12 \\ { ^[g ] , ^[g ] } + d^[g ] ^2[g ] , [ regul s - t 2 ] where @xmath29 $ ] is the differential operator ^_x ( -14 ) g^(x ) _ x+ ( r^(x)- ^_x ^_x ) .",

    "here we are assuming that all these terms depend on the regulator , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "these states can be chosen in such a way that for any pair of physically acceptable states , i.e. hadamard states in the sense of ref .",

    "these counterterms can be extracted from the singular part of a schwinger - dewitt series @xcite .",
    "the choice of these counterterms is not unique but this ambiguity can be absorbed into the renormalized coupling constants which appear in the equations of motion for the gravitational field .",
    "the _ semiclassical einstein equations _ for the metric @xmath7 can then be written as @xmath37+\\lambda g_{\\mu\\nu}\\right ) -2(\\alpha",

    "note that both the stress tensor and the quantum state are functionals of the metric , hence the notation .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the renormalized coupling constants , respectively , the gravitational constant , the cosmological constant and two dimensionless coupling constants which are zero in the classical einstein equations .",

    "the tensors @xmath44 and @xmath45 come from the functional derivatives with respect to the metric of the terms quadratic in the curvature in eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) , they are explicitly given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the riemann and ricci tensors , respectively .",
    "these two tensors are , like the einstein and metric tensors , symmetric and divergenceless : @xmath49 .",
    "note that a classical stress - energy can also be added to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) , but for simplicity we omit such a term .",
    "a solution of semiclassical gravity consists of a spacetime ( @xmath50 ) , a quantum field operator @xmath18 $ ] which satisfies ( [ 2.1 ] ) , and a physically acceptable state @xmath51 $ ] for this field , such that eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) is satisfied when the expectation value of the renormalized stress - energy operator is evaluated in this state .    for a free quantum field",
    "this theory is robust in the sense that it is consistent and fairly well understood .",
    "as long as the gravitational field is assumed to be described by a classical metric , the above semiclassical einstein equations seems to be the only plausible dynamical equation for this metric : the metric couples to mater fields via the stress - energy tensor and for a given quantum state the only physically observable c - number stress energy - tensor that one can construct is the above renormalized expectation value .",
    "however , lacking a full quantum gravity theory the scope and limits of the theory are not so well understood . it is assumed that the semiclassical theory should break down at planck scales , which is when simple order of magnitude estimates suggest that the quantum effects of gravity should not be ignored because the energy of a quantum fluctuation in a planck size region , as determined by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , is comparable to the gravitational energy of that fluctuation .",
    "the theory should also break down when the fluctuations of the stress - energy tensor are large .",
    "this has been emphasized by ford and colaborators @xcite .",
    "it is less clear , however , how to quantify what a large fluctuation is , and different criteria have been proposed @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we will discuss at length the issue of the validity of the semiclassical theory .",
    "one may illustrate the problem by the following example inspired in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us assume a quantum state formed by an isolated sytem which consists of a superposition with equal amplitude of one configuration with mass @xmath52 and another with mass @xmath53 .",
    "the semiclassical theory as described by eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) predicts that the gravitational field of the system is produced by the averaged mass @xmath54 .",
    "however , one would expect that if we send a succession of test particles to probe the gravitational field of the above system half of the time they would react to the field of a mass @xmath52 and half of the time to the field of a mass @xmath53 .",
    "if the two masses differ substantially the two predictions are clearly different , note that the fluctuation in mass of the quantum state is of order of @xmath55 .",
    "altough this example is suggestive a word of caution should be said in order not to take it too literaly .",
    "in fact , if the previous masses are macroscopic the quantum system decoheres very quickly @xcite and instead of being described by a pure quantum state it is described by a density matrix which diagonalizes in a certain pointer basis . for observables associated to such a pointer basis",
    "the matrix density description is equivalnet to that provided by a statistical ensemble . in any case , though , the results will differ from the semiclassical prediction .        the purpose of stochastical semiclassical gravity is to go beyond the semiclassical theory and account for the fluctuations of the stress - energy operator . but first , we have to give a physical observable that describes these fluctuations .",
    "to lowest order , these fluctuations are obviously described by the following bi - tensor , constructed with the two - point correlation of the stress - energy operator , @xmath56 , \\label{2.8}\\ ] ] where the curly brackets mean anticommutator , and where @xmath57 this bi - tensor will be called _ noise kernel _ from now on .",
    "note that we have defined it in terms of the unrenormalized stress - tensor operator @xmath24(x)$ ] on a given background metric @xmath7 , thus a regulator is implicitly assumed on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] )",
    ". however , for a linear quantum field the above kernel is free of ultraviolet divergencies because the ultraviolet behaviour of @xmath58 is the same as that of @xmath59 , thus following eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) one can replace @xmath60 by the renormalized operator @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) ; an alternative proof of this result is given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the noise kernel should be thought of as a distribution function , the limit of coincidence points has meaning only in the sense of distributions .",
    "an analysis of the noise kernel based on the point - separation method is given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the bi - tensor @xmath62 is real and positive - semidefinite , as a consequence of @xmath61 being self - adjoint .",
    "a simple proof can be given as follows .",
    "let @xmath34 be a given quantum state and let @xmath63 be a selfadjoint operator , @xmath64 , then one can write @xmath65 of eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) but where the coordinate @xmath26 now carries also the tensorial indices of eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) , then if we define @xmath66 for an arbitrary well behaved `` function '' @xmath67 ( which carries also tensorial indices ) , the previous unequality can be written as @xmath68 , which is the condition for the noise kernel to be posite semi - definite . note that when we will consider , later on , the inverse kernel @xmath69 we will implicitly assume that we are working in the subspace obtained from the eigenvectors which have strictly positive eigenvalues when we diagonalize the noise kernel .",
    "our purpose now is to perturbatively modify the semiclassical theory .",
    "thus we will assume that the background spacetime metric @xmath7 is a solution of the semiclassical einstein eqs .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "the stress - energy tensor will generally have quantum fluctuations on that background spacetime .",
    "one would expect that these fluctuations will have some effect on the gravitational field and that this may now be described by @xmath70 , where we will assume that @xmath71 is a linear perturbation to the background solution .",
    "the renormalized stress - energy operator and the state of the quatum field may now be denoted by @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] , respectively , and @xmath74 $ ] will be the corresponding expectation value .",
    "let us now introduce a gaussian stochastic tensor field @xmath75 defined by the following correlators : @xmath76 where @xmath77 means statistical average .",
    "the symmetry and positive semi - definite property of the noise kernel guarantees that the stochastic field tensor @xmath75 just introduced is well defined .",
    "note that this stochastic tensor does not capture the whole quantum nature of the fluctuations of the stress - energy operator since it assumes that cumulants of higher order are zero , but it does so at the gaussian level .",
    "an important property of this stochastic tensor is that it is covariantly conserved in the background spacetime @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of the conservation of @xmath79 $ ] one can seen that @xmath80 .",
    "taking the divergence in eq .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) one can then show that @xmath81 and @xmath82 so that @xmath83 is detreministic and represents with certainty the zero vector field in @xmath84 .",
    "one can also see that for a conformal field , i.e. a field whose classical action is conformally invariant , @xmath75 is traceless ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath85 , so that for a conformal matter field the stochastic source gives no correction to the trace anomaly .",
    "in fact , from the trace anomaly result which states that @xmath86 $ ] is in this case a local c - number functional of @xmath7 times the identity operator , we have that @xmath87 .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) that @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; an alternative proof based on the point - separation method is given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "all these properties make it quite natural to incorporate into the einstein equations the stress - energy fluctuations by using the stochastic tensor @xmath75 as the source of the metric perturbations .",
    "thus we will write the following equation .",
    "@xmath90 + \\lambda ( g_{\\mu\\nu}+h_{\\mu\\nu})\\right ) -2(\\alpha a_{\\mu\\nu}+\\beta b_{\\mu\\nu})[g+h]= \\langle \\hat t_{\\mu\\nu}^r\\rangle [ g+h]+2\\xi_{\\mu\\nu}. \\label{2.11}\\ ] ] this equation known as the _ semiclassical einstein - langevin equation _ , is a dynamical equation for the metric perturbation @xmath71 to linear order .",
    "it describes the back - reaction of the metric to the quantum fluctuations of the stress - energy tensor of matter fields , and gives a first order correction to semiclassical gravity as described by the semiclassical einstein equation ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "note that the stochastic source @xmath75 is not dynamical , it is independent of @xmath71 since it decribes the fluctuations of the stress tensor on the semiclassical background @xmath7 .",
    "an important property of the einstein - langevin equation is that it is gauge invariant . in the sense",
    "that if we change @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a stochastic vector field on the manifold @xmath93 .",
    "all the tensor which appear in the eq .",

    "if we substitute @xmath96 by @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) , we get eq .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) plus the lie derivative of the combination of the tensor which appear in eq . ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "this last combination vanishes when eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) is satisfied , as we have assumed .",
    "it is thus necessary that the background metric @xmath7 be a solution of semiclassical gravity .    a solution of eq . ( [ 2.11 ] )",
    "can be formally written as @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "this solution is characterized by the whole family of its correlation functions . from the statistical average of this equation we have",
    "that @xmath99 must be a solution of the semiclassical einstein equation linearized around the background @xmath7 .",
    "the fluctuation of the metric around this average are described by the moments of the stochastic field @xmath100=h_{\\mu\\nu}[\\xi]-\\langle h_{\\mu\\nu}\\rangle_s$ ] .",
    "thus the solutions of the einstein - langevin equation will provide the two point metric correlators @xmath101 .",
    "the stochastic theory may be understood as an intermediate step between the semiclassical theory and the full quantum theory . in the sense",
    "that whereas the semiclassical theory depends on the point - like value of the sress - energy operator , the stochastic theory carries information also on the two - point correlation of the stress - energy operator .",
    "we should also emphasize that , even if the metric fluctuations are classical ( stochastic ) , their origin is quantum not only because they are induced by the fluctuations of quantum matter , but also because they are supposed to describe some remnants of the quantum gravity fluctuations after some mechanism for decoherence and classicalization of the metric field @xcite . from the formal assumption that such a mechanism is the gell - mann and hartle mechanism of environment - induced decoherence of suitably coarse - grained system variables @xcite , one may , in fact , derive the stochastic semiclassical theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , that derivation is of course formal , given that , due to the lack of the full quantum theory of gravity , the classicalization mechanism for the gravitational field is not understood .      to illustrate the relation between the quantum and stochastic descriptions it is useful to introduce the following toy model .",
    "let us assume that the gravitational equations are described by a linear field @xmath96 coupled to a scalar source @xmath102 $ ] independent of @xmath96 , with the classical equations @xmath103 in flat spacetime .",
    "we should emphasize that this model would describe a linear theory of gravity analogous to electromagnetism and does not mimic the linearized theory of gravity in which @xmath104 is also linear in @xmath96 .",
    "however it captures some of the key features of linearized gravity .    in the heisenberg representation the quantum field",
    "@xmath105 satisfies @xmath106 the solutions of this equation , i.e. the field operator at the point @xmath26 , @xmath107 , may be written in terms of the retarded propagator @xmath108 as , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the free field . from this solution",
    "we may compute , for instance , the following two point quantum correlation function ( the anticommutator ) @xmath111 where the expectation value is taken in the quantum state in which both fields @xmath8 and @xmath96 have been quantized and we have used that for the free field @xmath112 .",
    "let us now compare with the stochastic theory for this problem .",
    "as discussed previously we should write a classical equation for the field @xmath96 where on the r.h.s .",
    "we substitute @xmath113 by the expectation value @xmath114 plus a gaussian stochastic field @xmath13 defined by the quantum correlation function of @xmath104 ( the noise kernel ) .",
    "note that in our model since @xmath104 is independent of @xmath96 we may simply renormalize the expectation value using time ordering , then for the vacuum state of the field @xmath16 , we would simply have @xmath115 .",
    "thus @xmath13 is defined as in ( [ 2.10 ] ) by @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the semiclassical stochastic equation is thus @xmath118 the solution of this equation may be written in terms of the retarded propagator as , @xmath119 from where the two point correlation function for the classical field @xmath96 , after using the definition of @xmath13 and that @xmath120 , is given by @xmath121    comparing ( [ 2.14 ] ) with ( [ 2.17 ] ) we see that the respective second terms on the right hand side are identical provided the expectation values are computed in the same quantum state for the field @xmath30 , note that we have assumed that @xmath104 does not depend on @xmath96 .",
    "the fact that the field @xmath96 is also quantized in ( [ 2.14 ] ) does not change the previous statement . in the real theory of gravity @xmath104 , in fact ,",
    "depends also on @xmath96 and then the previous statement is only true approximately , i.e perturbatively in @xmath96 .",
    "the nature of the first terms on the right hand sides of equations ( [ 2.14 ] ) and ( [ 2.17 ] ) is different : in the first case it is the two point expectation value of the free quatum field @xmath122 whereas in the second case it is the average of the two point classical average of the homogeneous field @xmath123 , which depends on the initial conditions .",

    "on the other hand , the results of this calculation , which confirm our expectations that gravitational fluctuations are negligible at length scales larger than the planck length , but also predict that the fluctuations are strongly suppressed on small scales , can be considered a first test of stochastic semiclassical gravity .",
    "in addition , we can extract conclusions on the possible qualitative behavior of the solutions to the einstein - langevin equation .",
    "thus , it is interesting to note that the correlation functions at short scales are characterized by correlation lengths of the order of the planck length ; furthermore , such correlation lengths enter in a non - analytic way in the correlation functions .",
    "this kind of non - analytic behavior is actually quite common in the solutions to langevin - type equations with dissipative terms and hints at the possibility that correlation functions for other solutions to the einstein - langevin equation are also non - analytic in their characteristic correlation lengths .",

    "a natural measure of the strength of fluctuations is @xmath495 @xcite , the ratio of the variance @xmath496 of fluctuations in the energy density ( expectation value of the @xmath497 operator minus the square of the mean @xmath498 taken with respect to some quantum state ) to its mean - squared ( square of the expectation value of @xmath498 ) : alternatively , we can use the quantity introduced by kuo and ford @xcite @xmath499 assuming a positive definite variance @xmath500 , then @xmath501 and @xmath502 always , with @xmath503 falling in the classical domain .",

    "this is a simple counter - example to the claim of kf , since @xmath506 holds also for minkowski space , where scg is known to be valid at large scales .",
    "ph do not see sufficient ground to question the validity of scg at energy below the planck energy when the spacetime is depictable by a manifold structure , approximated locally by the minkowski space . to them the fluctuations to mean being of the order unity arises from the quantum nature of the vacuum state and says little about the compatibility of the field source with the spacetime the quantum field lives in .",
    "ph pointed out that one should refer to a scale ( of interaction or for probing accuracy ) when measuring the validity of scg .",
    "the conventional belief is that when reaching the planck scale from below , qftcst will break down because , amongst other things happening , graviton production at that energy will become significant so as to render the classical background spacetime unstable , and the mean value of quantum field taken as a source for the einstein equation becomes inadequate . to address this issue as well as the issue of the spatial extent where negative energy density can exist ,",
    "ph view it necessary to introduce a scale in the spacetime regions where quantum fields are defined to monitor how the mean value and the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor change .    in conventional field theories",
    "the stress tensor built from the product of a pair of field operators evaluated at a single point in the spacetime manifold is , strictly speaking , ill - defined .",
    "point separation is a well - established method which suits the present concern very well , and we will discuss this method in section [ sec4 ] .",

    "we then calculate the ratio of the fluctuations to the mean for a flat space ( minkowski geometry ) followed by a casimir geometry of one periodic spatial dimension .",
    "finally we discuss the meaning of our finding in relation to the issues raised above .      since the field operator in conventional point - defined quantum field theory is an operator - valued distribution , products of field operators at a point become problematic .",
    "this parallels the problem with defining the square of a delta function @xmath519 .",

    "in contrast to the ordinary point - defined quantum field theory , where ultraviolet divergences occur in the energy momentum tensor , smeared fields give no ultraviolet divergence . this is because smearing is equivalent to a regularization scheme which imparts an exponential suppression to the high momentum modes and restricts the contribution of the high frequency modes in the mode sum .    with this in mind , we start by defining the spatially smeared field operator _ t(f_*x * ) = ( t,*x * ) f_*x*(*x* ) d*x* where @xmath522 is a suitably smooth function . with this , the two point operator becomes ( _ t(f_*x*))^2 = ( t,*x* ) ( t,*x *  ) f_*x*(*x* ) f_*x*(*x *  ) d*x*d*x* which is now finite . in terms of the vacuum @xmath523 ( @xmath524 , for all @xmath525 ) we have the usual mode expansion ( t_1,*x*_1 ) = d(*k*_1 ) ( a_*k*_1u_*k*_1(t_1,*x*_1 ) + a^_*k*_1 u^*_*k*_1(t_1,*x*_1 ) ) with u_*k*_1(t_1,*x*_1 ) = n_k_1 e^i ( * k*_1_1 - t_1_1 ) , _ 1 = | * k*_1 | , where the integration measure @xmath526 and the normalization constants @xmath527 are given for a minkowski and casimir spaces by ( [ mdu ] ) and ( [ cdu ] ) respectively .",

    "in particular , it saturates its upper bound of 1 around @xmath560 .",
    "note that if one adheres to the kf criterion @xcite one would say that semiclassical gravity fails , but all that is happening here is that @xmath561 while @xmath562 shows no special feature .",
    "the real difference between these two functions is the cross term , which is responsible for their markedly different structure and behavior .    in fig .",
    "2 , the main feature to notice is that the regularized energy density crosses from negative to positive values at around @xmath560 . the negative casimir energy density calculated in a point - wise field theory which corresponds to small ranges of @xmath555",
    "is expected , and is usually taken to signify the quantum nature of the casimir state .",
    "as @xmath555 increases we are averaging the field operator over a larger region , and thus sampling the field theory from the ultraviolet all the way to the infrared region . at large @xmath555 finite size effect begins to set in .",
    "the difference and relation of these two effects are explained in @xcite : casimir effect arises from summing up the quantum fluctuations of all modes ( as altered by the boundary ) , with no insignificant short wavelength contributions , whereas finite size effect has dominant contributions from the longest wavelength modes , and thus reflect the large scale behavior . as the smearing moves from a small scale to the far boundary of space , the behavior of the system is expected to shift from a casimir - dominated to a finite size - dominated effect .",
    "this could be the underlying reason in the crossover behavior of @xmath556 .      now that we have the results we can return to the issues raised earlier .",
    "we discuss the first two here , i.e. , 1 ) fluctuations of the energy density and validity of semiclassical gravity , 2 ) the spatial extent where negative energy density can exist .",
    "we will discuss the regularization of energy density fluctuations and the issue of the cross term in the next subsection .      from these results",
    "we see that i ) the fluctuations of the energy density as well as its mean both increase with decreasing distance ( or probing scale ) , while ii ) the ratio of the variance of the fluctuations in emt to its mean - squared is of the order unity .",
    "we view the first but not the second feature as linked to the question of the validity of scg .",
    "the second feature represents something quite different , pertaining more to the quantum nature of the vacuum state than to the validity of scg .",
    "if we adopt the criterion of kuo and ford @xcite that the variance of the fluctuation relative to the mean - squared ( vev taken with respect to the ordinary minkowskian vacuum ) being of the order unity be an indicator of the failure of scg , then all spacetimes studied above would indiscriminately fall into that category , and scg fails wholesale , regardless of the scale these physical quantities are probed .",
    "this contradicts with the common expectation that scg is valid at scales below planck energy .",
    "we believe the criterion for the validity or failure of a theory should depend on the range or the energy probed .",
    "the findings of phillips and hu @xcite related here seem to confirm this : both the mean ( the vev of emt with respect to the minkowski vacuum ) and the fluctuations of emt increase as the scale deceases .",
    "as one probes into an increasingly finer scale or higher energy the expectation value of emt grows in value and the induced metric fluctuations become important , leading to the failure of scg .",
    "a generic scale for this to  happen is the planck length . at such energy densities and above , particle creation from the quantum field vacuum",
    "would become copious and their backreaction on the background spacetime would become important @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the quantum field emt entails these quantum processes . the induced metric fluctuations @xcite render the smooth manifold structure of spacetime inadequate , spacetime foams @xcite including topological transitions @xcite begin to appear and scg no longer can provide an adequate description of these dominant processes .",
    "this picture first conjured by wheeler is consistent with the common notion adopted in scg , and we believe it is a valid one .      it is well known that negative energy density exists in casimir geometry , moving mirrors , black holes and worm holes .",
    "proposals have also been conjured to use the negative energy density for the design of time machines @xcite .",
    "our results ( figures 1 , 2 ) provide an explicit scale dependence of the regularized vacuum energy density @xmath563 and its fluctuations @xmath564 , specifically @xmath565 , the ratio of the smearing length ( field scale ) to that of the casimir length ( geometry scale ) .",
    "for example , fig .",

    "recall @xmath510 gives the spatial extent the field is probed or smeared .",

    "\\c ) for the minkowski vacuum the ratio of the variance to the mean - squared , calculated from the coincidence limit , is identical to the value of the casimir case at the same limit for spatial point separation while identical to the value of a hot flat space result with a temporal point - separation .",

    "b ) , we can trace back the calculation of the fluctuations ( second moment ) of the energy momentum tensor in ratio to its mean ( first moment ) to the integral of the term containing the inner product of two momenta @xmath569 summed over all participating modes .",
    "the modes contributing to this are different for different geometries , e.g. , minkowski versus casimir boundary for the einstein universe this enters as 3j symbols  and could account for the difference in the numerical values of @xmath504 for the different cases .    for point c ) , to begin with , it is well - known that the regularization by taking the coincidence limit of a spatial versus a temporal point separation will give different results .",
    "the case of temporal split involves integration of three spatial dimensions while the case of spatial split involve integration of two remaining spatial and one temporal dimension , which would give different results .",
    "the calculation of fluctuations involves the second moment of the field and is in this regard similar to what enters into the calculation of moments of inertia for rotating objects .",
    "we suspect that the difference between the temporal and the spatial results is similar , to the extent this analogy holds , to the difference in the moment of inertia of the same object but taken with respect to different axes of rotation",
    ".    it may be surprising that in a minkowski calculation the result of casimir geometry or thermal field should appear , as both cases involve a scale ",
    "the former in the spatial dimension and the latter in the ( imaginary ) temporal dimension .",
    "( both cases have the same topology @xmath570 , with the @xmath571 in the ( imaginary ) time for the former and in the space for the latter . )",
    "but if we note that the results for casimir geometry or thermal field are obtained at the coincidence ( ultraviolet ) limit , when the scale ( infrared ) of the problem does not intercede in any major way , then the main components of the calculations for these two cases would be similar to the two cases of taking the coincidence limit in the spatial and temporal directions in minkowski space .",
    "all of these cases are effectively devoid of scale as far as the pointwise field theory is concerned .",
    "as soon as we depart from this limit the effect of the presence of a scale shows up .",
    "the point - separated or field - smeared results for the casimir calculation shows clearly that the boundary scale enters in a major way and the result for the fluctuations and the ratio are different from those obtained at the coincident limit . for other cases where a scale enters intrinsically in the problem such as that of a massive or non - conformally",
    "coupled field it would show a similar effect in these regards as the present cases ( of casimir and thermal field ) where a periodicity condition exists ( in the spatial and temporal directions respectively ) .",
    "we expect a similar strong disparity between point - coincident and point - separated cases .",
    "the field theory changes its nature in a fundamental and physical way when this limit is taken .",
    "this brings us to an even more fundamental issue made clear in this investigation , i.e. , the appearance of divergences and the meaning of regularization in the light of a point - separated versus a point - defined quantum field theory .",
    "an equally weighty issue brought to light in the study of phillips and hu is the meaning of regularization in the face of emt fluctuations .",
    "since the point - separated or smeared field expressions of the emt and its fluctuations become available one can study how they change as a function of separation or smearing scale in addition to how divergences arise at the coincidence limit . whether certain cross terms containing divergences have physical meaning is a question raised by the recent studies of wu and ford @xcite .",
    "we can use these calculations to examine these issues and ask the broader question of what exactly regularization means and entails , where divergences arise and why they need to be , and not just how they ought to be treated .    recall",

    "the method of point - separation is best suited for this purpose .",
    "the task is to seek a regularized noise - kernel for quantum fields in general curved spacetimes upon taking the coincidence limit .",
    "this was carried out by phillips and hu @xcite .",
    "the following is a summary of their work .",
    "ph began with a discussion of the procedures for dealing with the quantum stress tensor bi - operator at two separated points and the noise kernel and end with a general expression for the noise kernel in terms of the quantum field s green function and its covariant derivatives up to the fourth order .",
    "( the stress tensor involves up to two covariant derivatives . )",
    "this result holds for @xmath610 without recourse to renormalization of the green function , showing that @xmath611 is always finite for @xmath578 ( and off the light cone for massless theories ) .",
    "in particular for a massless conformally coupled free scalar field on a four dimensional manifold they computed the trace of the noise kernel at both points and found this double trace vanishes identitically .",
    "this implies that there is no stochastic correction to the trace anomaly for massless conformal fields , in agreement with results arrived at in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now to obtain the point - defined quantities , one needs to deal with the divergences in the coincidence limit . for this ph",
    "adopted the `` modified '' point separation scheme @xcite to get a regularized green function . in this procedure , the naive green function is rendered finite by assuming the divergences present for @xmath612 are state independent and can be removed by subtraction of a hadamard form .",
    "they showed that the noise kernel in the @xmath612 limit is meaningful for an arbitrary curved spacetime by explicitly deriving a general expression for the noise kernel and its coincident form .",
    "after following these expositions of ph , we will end our discussion with a reflection on the issues related to regularization we started addressing in the previous section , reiterating the important role the point - separated quantities can play in a new approach to a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "there is a fundamental shift of viewpoint in the nature and meaning of the point separation scheme : in the 70 s it was used as a technique ( many practitioners may still view it as a trick , even a clumpsy one ) for the purpose of identifying the ultraviolet divergences . now in the new approach ( as advocated by one of us @xcite ) we want to use the point - separated expressions to construct a quantum field theory for extended spacetimes .",
    "the point separation scheme introduced in the 60 s by dewitt @xcite was brought to more popular use in the 70 s in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes @xcite as a means for obtaining a finite quantum stress tensor . since the stress - energy tensor is built from the product of a pair of field operators evaluated at a single point , it is not well - defined . in this scheme ,",
    "one introduces an artificial separation of the single point @xmath26 to a pair of closely separated points @xmath26 and @xmath613 .",
    "the problematic terms involving field products such as @xmath614 becomes @xmath615 , whose expectation value is well defined . if one is interested in the low energy behavior captured by the point - defined quantum field theory  as the effort in the 70 s was directed ",
    "one takes the coincidence limit .",
    "once the divergences present are identified , they may be removed ( regularization ) or moved ( by renormalizing the coupling constants ) , to produce a well - defined , finite stress tensor at a single point .",
    "thus the first order of business is the construction of the stress tensor and then derive the symmetric stress - energy tensor two point function , the noise kernel , in terms of the wightman green function . in this section",

    "the point - wise limit of field theory of course has ultraviolet divergences and requires regularization . a new viewpoint towards regularization evolved from this perspective of treating conventional pointwise field theory as an effective theory in the coincident limit of the point - separated theory of extended spacetime .",
    "to end this discussion , we venture one philosophical point we find resounding in these investigations reported here .",
    "it has to do with the meaning of a point - defined versus a point - separated field theory , the former we take as an effective theory coarse - grained from the latter , the point - separated theory reflecting a finer level of spacetime structure .",
    "it bears on the meaning of regularization , not just at the level of technical procedures , but related to finding an effective description and matching with physics observed at a coarser scale or lower energy .",
    "in particular , we feel that finding a finite energy momentum tensor ( and its fluctuations as we do here ) which occupied the center of attention in the research of quantum field theory in curved spacetime in the 70 s is only a small part of a much larger and richer structure of theories of fields and spacetimes .",
    "we come to understand that whatever regularization method one uses to get these finite parts in a point - wise field theory should not be viewed as universally imparting meaning beyond its specified function , i.e. , to identify the divergent pieces and provide a prescription for their removal .",
    "we believe the extended structure of spacetime ( e.g. , via point - separation or smearing ) and the field theory defined therein has its own much fuller meaning beyond just reproducing the well - recognized result in ordinary quantum field theory as we take the point - wise or coincident limit . in this way of thinking ,",
    "the divergence- causing terms are only ` bad ' when they are forced to a point - wise limit , because of our present inability to observe or resolve otherwise . if we accord them with the full right of existence beyond this limit , and acknowledge that their misbehavior is really due to our own inability to cope , we will be rewarded with the discovery of new physical phenomena and ideas of a more intricate world .",
    "( maybe this is just another way to appreciate the already well - heeded paths of string theory . )",
    "blh wishes to thank the organizers of this course for the invitation to lecture and their warm hospitality at erice .",

    "<S> whereas semiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical einstein equation with sources given by the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor of quantum fields , stochastic semiclassical gravity is based on the einstein - langevin equation , which has in addition sources due to the noise kernel . </S>",
    "<S> the noise kernel is the vacuum expectation value of the ( operator - valued ) stress - energy bi - tensor which describes the fluctuations of quantum matter fields in curved spacetimes . we show how a consistent stochastic semiclassical theory can be formulated as a perturbative generalization of semiclassical gravity which describes the back reaction of the lowest order stress - energy fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the original approach @xcite used in the early investigations leading to the establishment of this field @xcite ( for a review emphasizing ideas , see @xcite ) was based on quantum open system concepts ( where the metric field acts as the `` system '' of interest and the matter fields as part of its `` environment '' ) and the influence functional method . here , following refs . </S>",

    "<S> contrary to prior claims , the ratio of variance to mean - squared being of the order unity does not necessarily imply the failure of semiclassical gravity . </S>",
    "<S> expressions for the variance to mean - squared ratio as a function of the ratio of the intrinsic to extrinsic scale ( defined by the separation of the plates or the periodicity of space for the casimir topology ) identifying the spatial extent where negative energy density prevails are useful for studying quantum field effects in worm holes , baby universe and the design feasibility of ` time - machines ' . </S>",
    "<S> this study also raises new questions into the very meaning of regularization of the stress - energy tensor for quantum fields in curved or ordinary flat spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> it corroborates the view held by one of us @xcite that at high energies it is more useful to consider spacetime as possesing an extended structure , with the stress - energy bi - tensor of quantum matter fields as the source . to compare with the more familiar point - defined quantum field theory operative at low energies </S>",

    "<S> describing the behavior of fluctuations of quantum fields one could investigate a host of important problems in early universe and black hole physics . </S>",
    "<S> this includes addressing the viability of a vacuum - dominated phase which inflationary cosmology is predicated upon , examining how structures are seeded , how the horizon behavior of a black hole is altered and how the late time dynamics of black holes is affected with backreaction of hawking radiation . </S>",
