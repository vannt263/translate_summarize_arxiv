    "researchers disagree on several key issues of disk evolution , particularly regarding fragmentation and planet formation , despite numerous studies of gravitational instabilities in protoplanetary disks ( see durisen et al .",
    "2006 for a review ) .",
    "recent three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary disks with gravitational instabilities ( gis ) demonstrate disparate evolutions , and the differences involve the importance of convection in disks , the dependence of disk cooling on metallicity , and the stability of disks to fragmentation and clump formation @xcite .",
    "these disparities may be due to differences in the treatments of radiative transfer and the assumed equation of state .",
    "our own group has undertaken systematic improvements to the indiana university hydrodynamics group code in these two areas .",
    "boley et al .",
    "( in preparation ) will present a new scheme for 3d radiative cooling in disks that passes a series of accuracy and reliability tests , which are suggested as a new standard for disk stability studies .",
    "because the equation of state can severely change the outcome of a simulation @xcite , we have also implemented an internal energy that takes into account the translational , rotational , and vibrational states of h@xmath0 . during its development",
    ", we noticed that in all treatments to date of planet formation by disk instability , the effects of the rotational states of h@xmath0 have been , at best , only poorly approximated .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to draw attention to possible consequences of various approximations for the internal energy of h@xmath0 that are in the literature and to disseminate the correct treatment for h@xmath0 .",
    "we have begun a series of simulations to investigate the severity of using the incorrect internal energies .",
    "we mention only preliminary results in this letter , but the simulations will be fully discussed in a future paper .",
    "this letter is laid out as follows : in  2 we outline the correct treatment of h@xmath0 under simple conditions , i.e. , no dissociation and no ionization .",
    "we discuss the ortho / para hydrogen ratio for optically thick protoplanetary disks in  3 , and we summarize the main points of the letter in  4 .",
    "in this section we summarize relevant thermodynamic relations . for an in - depth discussion , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "consider the following thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas : let @xmath4 be the internal energy for @xmath5 particles , @xmath6 the specific internal energy , @xmath7 the internal energy density , @xmath8 the pressure , @xmath9 the gas temperature , @xmath10 the gas density , @xmath11 the mean molecular weight in proton masses , @xmath12 the specific heat capacity at constant volume , @xmath13 the partition function for the ensemble , @xmath14 the partition function for a single particle , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath17 is the proton mass .",
    "we only consider independent contributions to the partition function from translation , rotation , and vibration represented by @xmath18 .",
    "the internal energy @xmath4 and the specific internal energy @xmath6 can be calculated by @xmath19 for constant @xmath10 . because the gas is ideal , @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath12 is constant , then @xmath21 @xcite calculate @xmath12 from the helmholtz free energy , which is valid , but then assume @xmath22 , which is invalid , because @xmath12 is dependent on @xmath9 .",
    "other authors have followed suit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this assumption could be troublesome for gas dynamics in a hydrodynamics simulation ( see below ) .",
    "we do note that the severity of this error may depend on the state variables evolved in a given code , and only the authors who employ @xmath22 will be able to say in detail how it affects their simulations",
    ".      molecular hydrogen exists as para hydrogen and as orthohydrogen where the proton spins are antiparallel and parallel , respectively .",
    "the partition function for parahydrogen is @xmath23 and the partition function for orthohydrogen is @xmath24 where @xmath25 k @xcite . when the two species are in equilibrium , @xmath26 .",
    "however , the ortho / para ratio ( b : a ) could also be frozen if no efficient mechanism for converting between the species is available .",
    "this leads to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "the additional exponential is required in the orthohydrogen partition function when the ortho and para species are at some fixed ratio to ensure that rotation only contributes to the internal energy once the rotational states are excited , i.e. , @xmath29 as @xmath30 .    to consider the vibrational states , we approximate the molecule as an infinitely deep harmonic oscillator , where @xmath31 @xmath32 k @xcite . because we are only interested in temperatures @xmath33 k where dissociation of h@xmath0 is insignificant",
    ", we can ignore differences between equation ( 4 ) and a proper @xmath34 , which would take into account the anharmonicity of the molecule and that the molecule has a finite number of vibrationally excited states .",
    "we can use equation ( 1 ) to write the specific internal energy for h@xmath0 @xmath35 when the gas is ideal and dissociation and ionization can be ignored , the first adiabatic exponent @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "figure 1 indicates the @xmath1 profiles for the equilibrium case , pure parahydrogen , and a 3:1 mix , which is consistent with figure 2 of @xcite , as it should be because our derivation of @xmath12 is equivalent to theirs .",
    "the specific internal energy profiles as calculated by equation ( 5 ) are shown in figure 2 by solid lines .",
    "curves for @xmath37 are also shown in figure 2 by dashed lines .",
    "the approximation @xmath22 gives quite different behavior from the correct @xmath6 , e.g. , the incorrect 3:1 curve most closely follows the correct pure parahydrogen curve .",
    "the offset of the correct 3:1 mix profile is due to the energy stored in the parallel spins of the protons .",
    "the dotted line represents the curve @xmath38 for @xmath39 k and @xmath40 for @xmath41 k , which is the energy equation used by @xcite .",
    "although this may be a reasonable approximation for @xmath6 when the hydrogen species are in equilibrium , this approximation could be troublesome for the hydrodynamics .",
    "this is because the discontinuity guarantees that @xmath12 becomes very large near 100 k , which forces @xmath1 to unity .",
    "such discontinuities may artificially favor gas giant formation by disk instability , because isothermal ( @xmath1 ) gas behavior favors fragmentation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the clumping that is reported by @xcite occurs at @xmath42 k ( see boss s figure 2 ) .",
    "finally , a constant @xmath1 approximation @xcite poorly represents @xmath6 in the temperature regime where jupiter probably formed ; neither @xmath43 or 7/5 can be assumed confidently .",
    "the dynamical effects that could result from assuming @xmath22 are evaluated by taking the temperature derivative of the dashed curves in figure 2 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure 3 , and the curves depart drastically from the correct @xmath1 profiles . as mentioned above , @xmath12 can be calculated from the helmholtz free energy as is done by @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to compute @xmath1 from @xmath12 correctly but then evolve the gas with an erroneous effective specific heat because many hydrodynamics codes evolve @xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the ideal gas law @xmath45 is assumed as well , then effective @xmath1 profiles like those shown in figure 3 seem to be unavoidable when @xmath22 is assumed for a temperature dependent @xmath12 . because fragmentation becomes more likely as @xmath1 becomes smaller ( rice et al .",
    "2005 ; michael et al .  in preparation ) , the @xmath22 assumption should artificially make fragmentation more likely in some temperature regimes and less likely in others .",
    "preliminary simulations of a disk with solar composition indicate that when gis activate between 30 and 50k for an equilibrium ortho - para mixture , the @xmath22 simulation evolves more rapidly and has a more flocculent spiral structure than the correct @xmath6 simulation for the same cooling rates .",
    "in addition , denser substructures form in some spiral arms of the @xmath22 simulation throughout the simulation , while dense substructures only form during the burst of the correct @xmath6 simulation .",
    "when the instabilities occur outside this temperature regime , the differences are diminished .",
    "as indicated in  2 , the dynamical behavior of the gas is dependent on the ortho / para ratio and whether the species are in equilibrium for all @xmath9 .",
    "this ratio for various astrophysical conditions has been addressed by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , typically in the context of interstellar clouds or photodissociation regions .",
    "however , for plausible solar nebula conditions , the ortho / para ratio has been inadequately addressed ; for example , @xcite used an estimate for the h@xmath46 number density that was derived originally to give the total gas phase ion number density in gas for which dissociative recombination dominates the removal of ions . at protoplanetary disk number densities , however , ion removal should be primarily on grain surfaces if the ratio of grain surface area to hydrogen nucleon number density is the same as it is in diffuse interstellar clouds .    for protoplanetary disk conditions ,",
    "the conversion between ortho and parahydrogen is principally due to protonated ions such as h@xmath47 .",
    "consequently , we will assume that all ionizations lead to h@xmath47 formation .",
    "another possible conversion mechanism is through interactions between h@xmath0 and grains ; however , this conversion might only be significant when the temperature drops below about 30 k @xcite .",
    "consider the balance between @xmath48 production by cosmic rays ( cr ) and h@xmath49 depletion by dust grains : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the @xmath54 , @xmath48 , and grain number densities , respectively , @xmath55 is the ionization rate by crs and other energetic particles ( ep ) , @xmath56 is the average radius of the grains , and @xmath57 is the thermal velocity of @xmath48 . if we assume standard interstellar extinction , then @xmath58 @xmath59 , but as we discuss below , this number is ambiguous . the @xmath55 appropriate for a protoplanetary disk is also ambiguous .",
    "cosmic rays and stellar eps are important in ionizing the disk surface @xcite , but because these particles are attenuated exponentially with a scale length of about 100 g @xmath59 @xcite , stellar eps probably do not contribute to @xmath52 . moreover , protostellar winds could lead to a significant reduction of @xmath55 in analogy to cr modulation by the solar wind @xcite .",
    "however , at a surface density of roughly 380 g @xmath59 , ep production by @xmath60al decay is as important as crs with @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "it is likely that @xmath62 . for our estimate",
    "we adopt the interstellar rate @xmath63 @xcite . using these numbers in equation ( 6 ) and adopting a thermal velocity of 1 km s@xmath64 , @xmath65 . by adopting a collisional rate coefficient @xmath66 for the h@xmath49 interaction with h@xmath0 @xcite , the lower limit timescale for ortho and para hydrogen to reach equilibrium",
    "is @xmath67 yr .",
    "the equilibrium timescale is short enough that the ortho / para ratio can thermalize in the lifetime of a disk , but the equilibrium timescale is longer than the dynamical timescale inside about 40 au : ortho and parahydrogen should be treated as independent species for hydrodynamical simulations of young protoplanetary disks .    what ortho / para ratio should a dynamicist assume for gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disk simulations ?",
    "the answer is uncertain .",
    "vertical and radial stirring induced by shock bores @xcite , which could possibly lead to mixing of the low altitude disk interior with the high - altitude photodissociation region in the disk atmosphere @xcite , will transport gas through different temperature regimes on dynamic timescales .",
    "this could lead to nonthermalized ortho / para ratios like those that are measured from h@xmath0 rotational transition lines in some photodissociation regions @xcite and in neptune s stratosphere @xcite .",
    "moreover , accretion of the outer disk will bring material with a cold history into warmer regions of the disk .",
    "it is unclear whether the ortho / para ratio of , say , 15 k gas will be thermalized with @xmath68 or whether the ortho / para ratio will be 3:1 , which is the expected ratio for h@xmath0 formation on cold grains @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the ortho / para ratio may be critical to the evolution of a protoplanetary disk . as can be seen in figure 1 ,",
    "the pure parahydrogen mix has a @xmath1 that approaches 4/3 for @xmath69 k. this could make the 160 k regime the most likely region of the disk to fragment because , as @xmath1 decreases , it becomes harder for the gas to support itself against local gravitational and hydrodynamic stresses ( rice et al .  2005 ; michael et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "hydrodynamicists need to consider ortho / para ratios between pure parahydrogen and 3:1 because of our ignorance of this ratio in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the above discussion is based on the assumption that @xmath70 , which is probably reasonable for very young protoplanetary disks but may not be reasonable for disks with ages of about 1 ma .",
    "grain growth and dust settling may significantly lower the value of @xmath71 by depleting the total grain area ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because models of t tauri disks must take into account the effects of grain growth in order to match observed spectral energy distributions @xcite , there may be a period in a disk s evolution when the ortho and parahydrogen change from dynamically independent species to species in statistical equilibrium .",
    "such a transition may also take place at certain radii in a disk , e.g. , near edges of a dead zone @xcite .",
    "as indicated by figure 1 , a transition to statistical equilibrium could have significant dynamical consequences for disk evolution and may induce clump formation by gis .",
    "the effects of the rotational states of h@xmath0 must be explicitly modeled in hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks .",
    "constant @xmath1 approximations are insufficient for modeling the dynamic behavior of the gas because they ignore the transition from a @xmath43 gas to a @xmath72 gas .",
    "this transition probably took place near jupiter s location in the young solar nebula .",
    "discontinuous @xmath73 assumptions or the @xmath22 approximation could lead to severe errors in the behavior of the gas , including artificially driving @xmath74 .",
    "our estimates indicate that ortho and parahydrogen should be treated as separate species in hydrodynamics simulations of young protoplanetary disks because the timescale to thermalize the ortho / para ratio is longer than a dynamic timescale . however , a reasonable approximation to the ortho / para ratio in young protoplanetary disks is ambiguous .",
    "moreover , as a disk evolves , there may be a transition in the behavior of ortho and parahydrogen from independent species to statistical equilibrium , which might trigger disk fragmentation .",
    "hydrodynamicists should consider a range of ortho / para ratios and the equilibrium case until this ambiguity is resolved .",
    "for an equilibrium mix ( black ) , parahydrogen ( red ) , and a 3:1 ortho / para ratio mix ( blue ) .",
