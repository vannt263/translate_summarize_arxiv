    "grand unified theories ( guts ) offer one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) , unifying three of the four fundamental forces of nature . towards a more fundamental theory of nature it would ,",
    "however , be desirable to also explain the pattern of fermion masses and mixing with its plenty of parameters . hence",
    ", successful models of flavour in guts need to address two main issues , firstly , they have to achieve a working mechanism for gut symmetry breaking , including sufficient suppression of proton decay without unacceptably large fine - tuning , and secondly , they should provide correct predictions for the flavour observables , such as the yukawa coupling ratios and mixing angles .",
    "existing models which manage to naturally suppress proton decay either predict the unrealistic quark - lepton yukawa relation @xmath4 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which may only be viable in the presence of extensive uncontrolled higher order corrections ( e.g.  @xcite ) rendering the model non - predictive , or the experimentally disfavoured combination of the georgi - jarlskog relations @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite ( as e.g.  in @xcite ) , or rely on linear combinations of gut yukawa operators ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which again implies the loss of predictivity .",
    "furthermore , there exists a large number of gut models which focus on the flavour sector , but do not include the higgs potential .",
    "so while there are several existing models focusing on one of these two concerns , we are not aware of any work to date capable of resolving the two challenges in full detail ( and without invoking extra space - time dimensions ) in a predictive setup , also given the present rather precise experimental data .",
    "in this paper we employ the framework of supersymmetric ( susy ) guts , as in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) the gauge couplings unify to a surprising precision .",
    "the scale where they unify ( about @xmath7  gev ) is also large enough to sufficiently suppress proton decay from dimension six gut operators @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to proton decay mediated by additional heavy gauge bosons , in a gut model the minimal embedding of the higgs fields contains additional colour triplets which also lead to baryon number violating operators .",
    "therefore the colour triplets have to be very heavy to suppress proton decay sufficiently or their couplings to the mssm fields should be very strongly suppressed . keeping the doublets of the su(5 ) higgs fields light ,",
    "while generating a high enough mass for the colour triplets constitutes the so - called `` doublet - triplet splitting ( dts ) problem '' .    in su(5 ) in four dimensions ,",
    "a proposed solution to the dts problem is the `` missing partner mechanism '' ( mpm ) @xcite or its improved version , the `` double missing partner mechanism '' ( dmpm ) @xcite which we will review briefly in the next section . in",
    "the existing models referred to above , either the mpm or the dmpm is applied .",
    "since guts not only unify the forces of the sm into a single gut force , but also the fermions into joint gut representations , they are indeed a promising starting point for addressing the flavour puzzle . more specifically , guts are capable of predicting the ratios between the yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons at the gut scale . after their renormalization group evolution to low energies ( including supersymmetric 1-loop threshold corrections ) ,",
    "these predictions can be compared to the experimental data for quark and lepton masses .",
    "as well known , the prediction of minimal su(5 ) for the charged lepton and down - type quark yukawa matrix , the relation @xmath4 already mentioned above , is strongly disfavoured by the experimental results on the fermion masses . but also the ubiquitous proposal for more realistic ratios , the above mentioned georgi - jarlskog relations , obtained from the introduction of a 45-dimensional higgs representation of su(5 ) and certain assumptions about the yukawa textures @xcite , are disfavoured by the recently improved data @xcite .",
    "to arrive at experimentally favoured predictions for gut scale yukawa coupling ratios , we employ an alternative approach @xcite involving higher - dimensional operators which contain a gut breaking higgs field . due to this ,",
    "new clebsch - gordan ( cg ) factors appear as yukawa coupling ratios , with interesting associated implications for the masses and mixing of the fermions , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show how gut flavour models featuring these promising quark - lepton mass relations can be combined with a version of the dmpm for solving the dts problem .    as explicit examples , we will present two models with these properties that are `` uv complete '' in terms of messenger fields and employ sets of discrete abelian symmetries ( referred to as shaping symmetries ) such that only the desired effective gut operators are generated when the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "the two models predict the gut scale quark lepton yukawa ratios but are not yet predictive for the fermion mixing parameters ( although the experimentally observed values can be fitted by both of the models ) , so we only view them as existence proofs which show that dts and predictive yukawa coupling ratios can indeed be combined .",
    "the strategies discussed here , however , provide the tools for the construction of more ambitious gut models of flavour , which should finally also predict the quark and lepton mixings and cp phases ( and include the observed neutrino masses ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we will start with a brief review of the mpm and dmpm and the recently proposed alternative yukawa coupling ratios .",
    "we will also discuss the implications of replacing the 75-dimensional representation used in the mpm and dmpm with an adjoint 24-dimensional representation of su(5 ) .",
    "this choice is particularly well suited towards combining the dmpm with the novel cg factors . in section",
    "[ sec : gut ] we discuss the impact of the additional fields on gauge coupling unification and on their implications for the colour triplet masses .",
    "we will especially focus here on the case of superpotentials with two adjoint higgs representations .",
    "we then address the yukawa sector in section [ sec : yukawas ] , where we describe the above - mentioned two predictive example models .",
    "before we summarise and conclude in section [ sec : conc ] , in section [ sec : proton ] we briefly comment on proton decay , showing it is under control in the proposed class of models .",
    "we present additional helpful material for model building in the appendices .",
    "in this section we present the general strategy that will be implemented in two example models .",
    "we begin our presentation with the review of the mpm and dmpm and the origin of the cg coefficients ( coming from higher dimensional operators ) used in our models .",
    "afterwards we discuss a modification of the dmpm with a gut higgs field in the adjoint representation and follow that with the actual dmpm realization implemented in our models , where a second higgs field in the adjoint representation is added .    throughout this section , for illustrative purposes , we consider that the bounds on proton decay rate require the effective mass of the colour triplets to be of at least @xcite , while the effective mass suppressing dimension six proton decay mediated by the colour triplets is required to be @xmath8 @xcite .      the basic idea of the missing partner mechanism ( mpm ) is the introduction of two new superfields @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 representations of su(5 ) .",
    "the decomposition of a @xmath11 of su(5 ) under the sm gauge group does not contain an su(2 ) doublet , but it includes an su(3 ) triplet .",

    "the lagrangian obtained from the of @xmath42 contains baryon number violating four fermion operators .",
    "these are proportional to @xmath43 from @xmath44 and to @xmath45 from @xmath46 . with the mass matrix @xmath47 given in eq .  , the effective triplet mass is thus , @xmath48 and @xmath49 we will always refer to their absolute values . ] @xmath50 while the suppression of dimension six proton decay is given by @xmath51 note that with a gut scale value of @xmath52 and @xmath53 below the planck scale , the dimension six proton decay is suppressed sufficiently with values of @xmath48 between @xmath54 and @xmath55 since the doublets obtain no mass terms , the splitting of doublet mass and effective triplet mass is achieved . using @xmath56",
    "one obtains an upper bound for @xmath57 . having the large representations @xmath11 and @xmath12 enter the renormalization group equations ( rges ) at this low mass scale , however , leads to the break down of perturbativity just above the gut scale .",
    "thus , the mpm solves the dts problem  but trades it for su(5 ) becoming non - perturbative much below the planck scale @xmath58 .      this trade - off",
    "can be avoided in the double missing partner mechanism ( dmpm ) , where the number of higgs fields in @xmath59 , @xmath31 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 representations gets doubled @xcite .",

    "the improvement of the dmpm compared to the mpm can be seen from the effective triplet mass @xmath69 @xmath70 the same effective triplet mass of @xmath71 can now be obtained while keeping high masses @xmath72 , provided the heavier doublet pair has a ( relatively ) small mass @xmath73 . with the large representations of su(5 ) having high masses ,",

    "dimension six proton decay is suppressed by @xmath74 in agreement with the bounds on proton decay .",

    "the superpotentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpm75 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmpm75 ] ) include mass terms for the 50-dimensional messengers .",
    "as such , one can not use symmetries to forbid non - renormalizable planck - scale suppressed operators such as @xmath75 ( for the mpm , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the dmpm ) .",
    "these planck - scale suppressed operators do not involve the 50-dimensional messengers and therefore generate dangerously large contributions to the masses of the doublets contained in the 5-dimensional representations , effectively spoiling the mechanism .",
    "given our philosophy , we must forbid these operators through a shaping symmetry .",
    "the mpm and the dmpm can then be restored by adding a singlet field @xmath78 , responsible for giving mass to the 50-dimensional superfields through couplings of the form @xmath79 , @xmath80 and a vev @xmath81 , as seen in the diagram in figure [ fig : mpm_s ] ( note @xmath78 is not acting as an external field but generating the mass term ) .",

    "field generating the mass term for the 50-dimensional messengers after getting a vev .",
    "[ fig : mpm_s ] ]    we will generalise this strategy of generating masses for the messenger fields through an additional singlet field in sections [ subsec : dmpm24 ] and [ sec : yukawas ] , to avoid similarly planck - scale suppressed operators spoiling the dmpm or the predictions for the yukawa coupling ratios .      the problem of non - viable gut predictions for the fermion masses in the minimal su(5 ) model , such as @xmath4 , can be solved through effective yukawa couplings generated from higher dimensional operators .",
    "when the higher dimensional operators contain a gut breaking higgs field , new ratios between the yukawa couplings of down - type quarks and charged leptons can emerge once the gut symmetry gets spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "due to the introduction of extra su(5 ) non - singlet fields , which participate in higher dimensional operators , there are in general several ways to construct invariants , namely multiple ways to contract the su(5 ) indices .",
    "in the general case , such effective operators are not predictive and introduce an arbitrary , linear combination of several cg factors .",
    "this issue is generic in flavour models and can be resolved by constructing a specific uv completion of the effective operators , see @xcite for mixing in lepton models , @xcite for gut relations , and for applications in ( gut ) flavour models , e.g.  @xcite . by introducing pairs of heavy messengers in the su(5 ) representations @xmath82 and @xmath83 ,",

    "[ fig : messengerdiagram1 ] and table  [ tab : effectiveftoperators11 ] , we briefly review the topology of the diagram and field combinations that lead to the cg factors @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for su(5 ) guts , which have been shown to be useful for flavour model building @xcite . to generate these relations",

    "so far we have discussed cg factors between the mssm yukawa couplings .",
    "for an analysis of proton decay , the cg factors to the yukawa couplings of the colour higgs triplets also play an important role . in appendix",
    "[ app : clebsch ] we present an extensive discussion of cg factors in su(5 ) , including those .      as we discussed in the previous subsection",
    ", the cg factors we want to combine with the dmpm require the gut breaking higgs field to be in the adjoint representation of su(5 ) , @xmath19 .",
    "this motivates us to replace the higgs field @xmath15 needed for the dmpm with the effective combination @xmath97 @xcite , which at the renormalizable level can be obtained by integrating out heavy messenger fields in the @xmath93 and @xmath90 representations of su(5 ) @xcite . to replace the @xmath15 in the mpm",
    ", we have to introduce a set of messenger fields @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    in analogy with the discussion in section [ pso ] , we avoid direct mass terms in order to forbid dangerous planck - scale suppressed operators that would generate universal mass contributions for higgs doublets and triplets .",
    "the messenger pairs @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and their corresponding primed versions obtain masses from the vev of a singlet field @xmath78 , charged under an additional shaping symmetry .",
    "we specify these symmetries for two example models in section [ sec : yukawas ] .",
    "one may wonder if some of these heavy 45-dimensional messengers could be the same , so that the number of fields in the spectrum would be reduced while preserving the structure of the mechanism .",
    "but if either @xmath109 or @xmath110 , it can be seen from figure  [ fig : heff ] that supergraphs without the @xmath108 mass insertion would be allowed , spoiling the splitting of doublets and triplets and generating large non - diagonal entries in @xmath111 . in turn , if either @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 , the dmpm is reduced to the mpm , reintroducing the issue of perturbativity .",
    "finally , an identification of @xmath115 would allow diagrams bypassing the 50-dimensional fields , generating unwanted mass term for both doublet and triplet components of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and thus a too large @xmath116-term .    with this messenger superfield content",
    ", we carefully checked that no dangerous planck - scale suppressed operators spoil the mechanism .",
    "the renormalizable superpotential is : @xmath117    after @xmath18 and @xmath78 obtain their vevs and integrating out the 45-dimensional messenger fields , we find the mass matrices for the higgs doublets and triplets to be @xmath118 which one can easily compare to the ones of eq .",

    ", the doublets in the pair @xmath121 stay massless , while the doublet pair in @xmath122 is heavy .",
    "using only @xmath22 and @xmath123 for the yukawa couplings of the sm fermions , the effective triplet component mass relevant for dimension 5 proton decay is given by @xmath124 the effective masses suppressing dimension six proton decay mediated by colour triplets are given by @xmath125 where we used the fact that @xmath126 and @xmath127 . now the requirement of @xmath8 can only be obtained with @xmath128 if the gut scale value is larger than @xmath129 . in this case",
    "one needs @xmath130 to obtain an effective triplet mass @xmath71 for dimension five proton decay operators .",
    "therefore , if the gut scale is high enough , the effective triplet mass can be large enough to stabilize the proton , while the large su(5 ) representations used in the dmpm can be heavy enough to keep the theory perturbative up to the planck scale .",
    "when @xmath18 is uncharged under additional symmetries , having @xmath68 several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath21 requires @xmath68 to arise from the spontaneous breakdown of a shaping symmetry , to avoid the term @xmath131 , which would give rise to a much too small effective triplet mass .",
    "note that the effective triplet masses entering dimension five proton decay can be expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates of doublet and triplet components as @xmath132 .",
    "the effective triplet mass of dimension six proton decay is then excellently approximated by @xmath133 .",
    "we have seen that the dmpm with an adjoint gut breaking higgs instead of a @xmath16 already solves the dts problem while providing the necessary building block for the desirable cg factors for flavour model building , if the gut scale is high enough . to conclude this section",
    ", we will argue why it is compelling to further introduce a second adjoint higgs field :    * in the minimal susy su(5 ) model @xcite , the single gut breaking @xmath19 contains an su(2 ) triplet component and an su(3 ) octet component with equal masses .",
    "demanding gauge coupling unification , the mass of the higgs colour triplets is required to be about @xmath134 gev @xcite , ruling out this model due to proton decay .",
    "non - renormalizable operators in the gut breaking superpotential can split the @xmath19 component masses , allowing a higher effective triplet mass @xcite ( see also section [ sec : gut ] ) .",
    "an additional @xmath19 can be used to realize this non - renormalizable superpotential in a renormalizable way . *",
    "it turns out that the introduction of an additional @xmath19 is not just a uv - completion of the non - renormalizable superpotential of @xcite .",
    "when both adjoints have approximately the same mass and therefore the second @xmath19 is not integrated out , the additional colour octet and electroweak triplet in the spectrum lead to more freedom for the gut scale and effective triplet mass . in the following section we discuss all possible renormalizable superpotentials with two adjoints and their impact on @xmath135 and @xmath69 from a gauge coupling unification analysis . *",
    "a renormalizable superpotential for one @xmath19 requires it to be uncharged under shaping symmetries in order for it to obtain a vev .",
    "however , such a shaping symmetry charge is vital in the type of flavour models considered here , to avoid unwanted admixtures of additional cg factors involving less insertions of @xmath18 . with a second @xmath19",
    ", the adjoint fields can acquire non - vanishing vevs even when charged under shaping symmetries .",
    "these features of renormalizable superpotentials for two adjoints are presented in detail in the next section .",
    "in gut extensions of the sm it is quite common to have additional fields below the gut scale that modify the rge running , as it is the case for the class of models in this paper .",
    "therefore one has to study the impact of the additional fields on the running of the gauge couplings and especially study their unification .",
    "the modified unification condition for the gauge couplings at one - loop reads @xmath136 where @xmath137 labels the sm gauge interaction and @xmath138 labels the additional superfields ( compared to the mssm ) , with masses @xmath139 and @xmath140 coefficients @xmath141 .",

    ", we assume that the heaviest incomplete su(5 ) multiplets to enter the rge running are the leptoquark vector bosons , such that the gut scale corresponds to their mass @xmath149 . while other cases can certainly arise , we focus on this option because it is quite common in our setup to have heavy leptoquark vector bosons , and furthermore we verified that in this case the triplet mass can be made very heavy as well .",
    "in addition to the mssm field content , the dmpm introduces one additional pair of su(2)-doublets , @xmath150 and @xmath151 and two additional pairs of su(3)-triplets , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154 , 2 .",

    "further interdependencies between @xmath147 , @xmath69 and @xmath135 are then implicit via their shared dependence on the other masses .",

    "note that for all three quantities the resulting uncertainty is dominated by the experimental error on @xmath187 . in the following",
    "we will not quote any errors on the masses anymore since the relative uncertainty changes only negligibly for the different superpotentials and for two - loop running .",
    "the reference scale @xmath188  gev is chosen due to the fact that @xmath189  gev and @xmath190  gev implies @xmath191  gev .    since the effective triplet mass @xmath69 receives significant two - loop contributions ( cf .",

    "these threshold corrections can have a sizeable impact on the low energy values of the yukawa couplings ( and thus the fermion masses ) , depending on the sparticle spectrum and @xmath206 .",
    "so the predictions here are two - fold : firstly , the predictions for the yukawa ratios at the gut scale imply constraints on the susy breaking parameters , which may be tested at future collider searches if susy is found . secondly , the ratios @xmath261 and @xmath262 are not affected by rg running and by the susy threshold corrections ( as long as the first two families of sfermions are almost degenerate in mass as commonly assumed ) .",

    "<S> we discuss how the double missing partner mechanism solution to the doublet - triplet splitting problem in four - dimensional supersymmetric su(5 ) grand unified theories ( guts ) can be combined with predictive models for the quark - lepton yukawa coupling ratios at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that towards this goal a second su(5 ) breaking higgs field in the adjoint representation is very useful and we discuss all possible renormalizable superpotentials with two adjoint higgs fields and calculate the constraints on the gut scale and effective triplet mass from a two - loop gauge coupling unification analysis . </S>",
    "<S> two explicit flavour models with different predictions for the gut scale yukawa sector are presented , including shaping symmetries and a renormalizable messenger sector . towards calculating the rates for proton decay induced by the exchange of colour triplets , </S>",
    "<S> the required clebsch - gordan coefficients for their couplings are calculated for the possible dimension five and six operators . </S>",
