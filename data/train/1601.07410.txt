    "<S> in this paper , we proposed a new lifetime distribution namely generalized weighted lindley ( glw ) distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the glw distribution is a useful generalization of the weighted lindley distribution , which accommodates increasing , decreasing , decreasing - increasing - decreasing , bathtub , or unimodal hazard functions , making the gwl distribution a flexible model for reliability data . </S>",
    "<S> a significant account of mathematical properties of the new distribution are presented . </S>",
    "<S> different estimation procedures are also given such as , maximum likelihood estimators , method of moments , ordinary and weighted least - squares , percentile , maximum product of spacings and minimum distance estimators . </S>",
    "<S> the different estimators are compared by an extensive numerical simulations . finally , we analyze two data sets for illustrative purposes , proving that the gwl outperform several usual three parameters lifetime distributions .    </S>",
