    "the said results for the pion - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) system @xcite are widely used as input in numerous works , not only in those studying aspects of the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the results represent an optimisation of the description of an extensive database ( db ) of measurements , ranging from the @xmath2 threshold to ( pion laboratory kinetic energy @xmath4 of ) a few gev .",
    "the experimental data is analysed via dispersion relations .",
    "the said phase - shift solution is regularly updated , conveniently appearing online , which facilitates the fast dissemination of any new results .",
    "furthermore , new measurements are frequently communicated to the developers of this platform prior to their formal publication , ensuring that the site remain at the state - of - the - art level on a number of hadronic processes . regarding the @xmath2 system ,",
    "the current said solution is dubbed wi08 .",
    "this paper examines one aspect of this solution , namely its low - energy behaviour . as such",
    ", it is expected to be of interest to those who extract important hadronic quantities from the low - energy said phase shifts or compare their experimental results to the predictions obtained on the basis of these phase shifts .    regarding the said phase - shift solutions for @xmath0 mev",
    ", our concerns have already been expressed on several occasions . to start with ,",
    "one has the impression that new @xmath2 measurements enter the said db with little regard for their self - consistency and/or compatibility with the measurements which are already present in the db",
    ". such a strategy would be less problematic , had the said group implemented robust statistics in their analysis ; however , their results are obtained with a ` standard ' @xmath5 function ( i.e. , with the arndt - roper formula @xcite ) , and are thus expected to be sensitive to the presence of outliers in the db ( in particular , of _ one - sided _",
    "outliers ) .",
    "secondly , the said results for @xmath0 mev are literally swamped by the measurements at higher energies . in case that the floating of the data sets is permitted ( as the case",
    "is when the arndt - roper formula is used in the optimisation ) , it is unavoidable that the low - energy behaviour of the partial - wave amplitudes will be influenced by the measurements acquired at higher energies .",
    "thirdly , the distribution of the normalised residuals , in a self - consistent analysis using a @xmath5 minimisation function , must be the normal distribution @xmath6 .",
    "any effects observed in this distribution ( e.g. , significant offsets , asymmetry , dependence of the normalised residuals on the independent variables in the problem , etc . )",
    "are indicative of problems in the input or in its modelling .",
    "we are not aware of any paper from the said group where these issues are addressed .",
    "regarding the use of the said solution for @xmath0 mev , one final remark is that the measurements from the three @xmath2 reactions , i.e. , from the two elastic - scattering ( es ) reactions ( @xmath7 ) and from the charge - exchange ( cx ) reaction ( @xmath8 ) , are forced into an isospin - invariant analysis framework .",
    "evidently , the said group choose to disregard the possibility of the violation of the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath2 interaction , which has been promulgated by some works during the past two decades @xcite .",
    "the presumptions in analyses employing the @xmath9-matrix parameterisations of this section relate to : a ) the number of terms which one retains from the original infinite power series ( expansion of the hadronic @xmath9-matrix elements in terms of a suitable variable , e.g. , of the pion kinetic energy @xmath10 in the centre - of - mass ( cm ) system ) , and b ) the forms used in the modelling of the resonant contributions . in both cases , we are confident that our modelling captures the details of the physical system .",
    "such an approach ensures that the detection of any outliers in the input dbs can not be attributed to the inability of these parametric forms to account for the energy dependence of the hadronic phase shifts ; as a result , the detection of outliers in the fits is indicative of experimental discrepancies .    in the analysis of the low - energy @xmath2 measurements using the @xmath9-matrix parameterisations ,",
    "we retain terms up to ( and including ) @xmath11 .",

    "the @xmath17-wave phase shift is parameterised according to the form @xmath18    since the @xmath19 wave contains the @xmath20 resonance , a singular ( at @xmath21 ) term must be added to the background term , leading to the expression @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath20 width , @xmath24 is the @xmath20 mass , @xmath25 is the proton mass , @xmath26 is the proton cm energy , and @xmath27 is the total cm energy .",

    "such a framework can not be used in order to conduct exclusive analyses of the data , be they restricted in energy or involving only one reaction .",
    "this is one important difference between our approach and theirs .",
    "the second difference relates to the procedure : we choose to analyse the two es processes ( this analysis fixes the @xmath33 and @xmath34 amplitudes ) and subsequently investigate whether isospin invariance is fulfilled , on the basis of comparisons with the measurements of the third reaction ( triangle identity ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the said group assume the fulfillment of the isospin invariance in the @xmath2 system at all energies , and analyse the three @xmath2 reactions in a joint optimisation scheme .",
    "so far , the emphasis has been placed on the differences between the two approaches .",
    "however , there are also similarities . for instance",
    ", both approaches rely on the correctness of the input data . to an extent ,",
    "we take steps towards investigating the self - consistency of the input db , whereas they avoid excluding measurements . only considering the number of the input data points , the sensitivity of our analysis to outliers",
    "is expected to be more pronounced than it is in their case : @xmath169 discrepant dcss in a db of @xmath170 data points wreck havoc ; the same amount of discrepant measurements in a db of over @xmath163 data points is surely less of a problem . as a result , we can not but thoroughly examine every new data set prior to including it in the db",
    "; in this respect , they can afford to be more generous . finally , both approaches rely on the correctness / completeness of the method incorporating the em effects ( distortion corrections to the hadronic phase shifts and to the partial - wave amplitudes ) in the analysis .",
    "to summarise , the said group assume that isospin invariance is fulfilled at all energies , whereas we test whether it is at low energy .",
    "they can not easily restrict their analysis to specific energy regions or reactions , whereas we may perform a variety of analyses in relation to the input dbs : we may perform joint analyses ( e.g. , by using as input the @xmath12 db along with either of the @xmath32 dbs or by submitting the measurements of all three @xmath2 reactions to a joint optimisation scheme ) or we may analyse the three @xmath2 reactions independently of one another ( using our @xmath9-matrix parameterisations ) .",
    "however , our analyses can only involve the low - energy region .",
    "both approaches rely on the correctness of the bulk of the measurements ( ours is significantly more sensitive to the presence of outliers in the db ) and both approaches rely on the correctness of the em corrections , applied to the hadronic phase shifts and to the partial - wave amplitudes on the way to fitting the observables .",
    "a self - consistent , @xmath5-based optimisation scheme satisfies the requirement that the distribution of the normalised residuals of the fit be normal , i.e. , that they follow the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "furthermore , these residuals must not exhibit significant dependences on the independent variables in the problem , e.g. , on the beam energy in this work . in a self - consistent optimisation scheme , where the input measurements are reliable and their modelling adequate , all fluctuations present in the residuals are random .",
    "we demonstrated that the results of the weighted linear fits to the scale factors @xmath57 , obtained from the data when using our @xmath9-matrix parameterisations , come out as expected : independent of the beam energy and ` clustering ' around the expectation value of @xmath1 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelkmatrix]-[fig : pimcxkmatrix ] ) .        when the arndt - roper formula is used in the optimisation",
    ", one expects that the data sets which must be scaled ` upwards ' should be balanced ( on average ) by those which must be scaled ` downwards ' .",
    "additionally , the energy dependence of the scale factors must not be significant .",
    "if these prerequisites are not fulfilled , the modelling of the input measurements can not be considered as successful .",
    "the scale factors , relating to the description of the said low - energy @xmath2 dbs with the wi08 solution , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allwi08 ] . at first glance",
    ", the plot leaves a satisfactory impression , in particular after considering the extent of the said @xmath2 db , as well as the practice of the said group to avoid excluding the outliers .",
    "consequently , the optimisation scheme leading to the wi08 solution yields normalised residuals for the scale factors  , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : chijsq ] ) . ] which are reasonably well centred on @xmath119 ( we disregard small effects ) .",
    "given that the reduced @xmath5 , corresponding to the entirety of the fitted data at low energy in the case of the wi08 solution , is about @xmath171 , the joint analysis of the data inevitably yields normalised residuals with a distribution broader than the normal .",
    "however , this broadening originates in the choice of the said group to seldom exclude outliers .",
    "let us finally express our criticism on the low - energy behaviour of the wi08 solution .",
    "the said input db comprises three distinct parts , identified as the sets of measurements of the three @xmath2 reactions .",
    "had their fit been unbiased , the general behaviour of the fitted @xmath57 values in terms of their dependence on @xmath165 , as obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : allwi08 ] , would also have been observed in any arbitrary subset of their db , consistent with the basic principles of the sampling theory ( adequate population , representative sampling ) .",
    "the scale factors , relating to the description of the said low - energy @xmath2 dbs with the wi08 solution , are shown ( separately for the three reactions ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] . had the three aforementioned conditions ( a)-(c ) been fulfilled in the said analysis at all energies , the scale factors of figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] would have come out independent of the beam energy and would have been centred on @xmath1 , as the case was for the joint analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : allwi08 ] .",
    "however , the bulk of the data for @xmath0 mev ( represented by the shaded bands in figs .  [ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] ) appears to be either underestimated by the wi08 solution ( i.e. , in case of the cx reaction ) or overestimated by it ( i.e. , in case of the two es reactions , the effects for the @xmath12 reaction being more pronounced ) .",
    "one notices that the mismatches decrease with increasing beam energy , converging to @xmath172 in the vicinity of @xmath167 mev .",
    "such a behaviour is consistent with the conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite for an energy - dependent isospin - breaking effect .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] and from table [ tab : wi08parameters ] , one may conclude that the wi08 solution does not describe sufficiently well the bulk of the low - energy measurements in any of the three @xmath2 reactions .",
    "evidently , the wi08 solution at low energy represents a fictitious , average @xmath2 process , one which does not adequately capture the dynamics of the three physical @xmath2 reactions . regarding the analysis of the scale factors obtained with the wi08 solution , we stress ( once again ) that their @xmath57 values , as they appear in the said web page @xcite , have only been fitted to by us with straight lines",
    "of course , no input from our approach is used in this part of the analysis .",
    "the conclusion appears to be inevitable . even in a framework of an analysis assuming the isospin invariance ( as the case is for the wi08 solution ) ,",
    "the isospin - breaking effects , albeit somewhat hidden , manifest themselves as systematic trends in the output of the optimisation and may be uncovered easily if the three @xmath2 reactions are analysed _",
    "separately_. this conclusion corroborates our insistence during the past two decades on investigating the behaviour of the normalised residuals in our pwas of the low - energy measurements .",
    "one might argue that the effects , contained in figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] and in table [ tab : wi08parameters ] , are not ` large '",
    ". however , it must be borne in mind that the isospin - breaking effects are not expected to be large .",
    "gibbs , ai , and kaufmann @xcite have shown that such effects mainly affect the @xmath13-wave part of the amplitude ( @xmath173 effects are seen in their fig .  1 ) , and ( to a lesser extent ) the no - spin - flip @xmath60-wave",
    "part ( smaller effects are seen in their figs .  2 ) .",
    "we have shown that the largest departure from the isospin invariance occurs in the phase shifts @xmath174 and @xmath175 , see figs .  2 and 3 of ref .",
    "both analyses appear to agree on the expected magnitude of such effects : roughly speaking , effects between @xmath122 and @xmath173 ( in the amplitude ) are expected at low energy .",
    "the systematic effects , observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] , have about the right size , as well as an energy dependence which is consistent with the findings of refs .  @xcite .",
    "the effects , shown in figs .  [ fig : pipelwi08]-[fig : pimcxwi08 ] and in table [ tab : wi08parameters ] , are systematic and are indicative of the non - fulfillment of at least one of the three conditions ( a)-(c ) listed in the beginning of this section .",
    "one of the safest conclusions , drawn from figs .",
    "[ fig : pipelkmatrix]-[fig : pimcxkmatrix ] , is that our approach yields results which closely represent and reproduce the bulk of the measurements for @xmath0 mev ; the low - energy behaviour of the wi08 solution does not appear to properly account for the bulk of the low - energy data as successfully .",
    "if future experimental activity in the @xmath2 sector reveals that , on average , the meson - factory , low - energy experiments had been affected by severe energy - dependent systematic effects , then a solution based on a dispersion - relation analysis framework ( like wi08 ) may be more reliable than ours .",
    "we will not speculate on how such effects could affect the two es processes in one way ( i.e. , resulting in a systematic underestimation of the relevant dcss ) and the cx reaction in another ( i.e. , resulting in a systematic overestimation of the relevant dcss ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the persistent discrepancies , observed in the @xmath2 system at low energy , are to be blamed elsewhere ( i.e. , on a departure from a theoretical constraint ) , then our choice to test the isospin invariance , rather than assume it , will be proven justified .",
