    "planar rotators are models with potential interactions involving two ",
    "component spins ; on the other hand , in the xy model , the spins have three components , only two of which are involved in the interaction , and the xy model can be regarded as an extremely anisotropic ( easy  plane ) heisenberg model .",
    "actually , the terminological convention adopted here as well as by other authors is not always followed , and the name `` xy model '' is sometimes used in the literature to indicate planar rotators ; on the other hand , both models are known to produce the same universality class .",
    "the two named models have been extensively studied , and possess a rich variety of applications in statistical as well as condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "these models have been especially studied in their saturated - lattice ( sl ) version , where each site is occupied by a particle ; as for symbols , classical sl spin models are first defined here : we consider a classical system , consisting of @xmath0component unit vectors @xmath1 ( usually @xmath2 ) , associated with a @xmath3dimensional ( bipartite ) lattice @xmath4 ( mostly @xmath5 ) ; let @xmath6 denote dimensionless coordinates of the lattice sites , and let @xmath7 denote cartesian spin components with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath8 ; particle orientations are parameterized by usual polar angles @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) or spherical ones @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ;    the interaction potentials considered here are assumed to be translationally invariant , restricted to nearest ",
    "neighbours , ferromagnetic ( fm ) ; they are , in general , anisotropic in spin space , and possess @xmath13 symmetry at least : @xmath14 where @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a positive quantity setting energy and temperature scales ( i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the absolute temperature ) ; the corresponding ( scaled ) hamiltonian reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is restricted to nearest neighbours , with each distinct pair being counted once . when @xmath21 , potential models defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq01b ] ) produce orientational disorder at all finite temperatures ( thus no orientational ordering transition at finite temperature ) @xcite ; in the following , the discussion shall be essentially restricted to the two cases @xmath22 ( pr ) and @xmath23 ( xy ) , respectively .",
    "it is by now well known that the pr model defined by @xmath5 supports a transition to a low  temperature phase with slow ( inverse  power  law ) decay of the correlation function and infinite susceptibility ; this is the very extensively studied berezinski  kosterlitz ",
    "thouless ( bkt ) transition ( see , e.g. refs . @xcite and others quoted therein ) , whose existence was proven rigorously by frhlich and spencer @xcite : the transition temperature was estimated to be @xmath24 @xcite , and a more recent and more refined result is @xmath25 @xcite ; the specific heat exhibits a maximum at a higher temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , anisotropic models defined by @xmath26 have been studied as well and proven to support a bkt transition when the ratio @xmath27 is sufficiently small @xcite ; an estimate of the transition temperature for the xy case is given by @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "lattice  gas ( lg ) extensions of the sl models can be defined as well , where each lattice site hosts one particle at most , and site occupation is also controlled by the chemical potential @xmath29 ; such models have often been used in connection with alloys and absorption ; this methodology somehow allows for pressure and density effects .",
    "lattice  gas ( lg ) extensions of the continuous  spin potential model considered here are defined by hamiltonians @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes occupation numbers ; notice that @xmath32 reinforces the orientation ",
    "dependent term , whereas @xmath33 opposes it , and that a finite value of @xmath34 only becomes immaterial in the sl limit @xmath35 .    for a square lattice , the sl ",
    "pr model produces a low  temperature bkt transition ; the existence of such a transition for the lg counterpart has been proven rigorously as well @xcite .",
    "in addition to the named rigorous results , still comparatively little is known about the above magnetic lg models with continuous spins , in marked contrast to the vast amount of information available for their sl counterparts ; for example , as far as we could check in the literature , their simulation study only started at the end of the 1990 s @xcite .",
    "a few years before the existence of a bkt transition was proven for the lg ",
    "pr model @xcite , the same model had been investigated by monte carlo simulation in the grand ",
    "canonical ensemble , and in the absence of a purely positional interaction , i.e. @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "simulations were carried out for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and showed that the bkt transition survives , even for mildly negative @xmath29 , and that the transition temperature is an increasing function of @xmath29 , in broad qualitative agreement with previous renormalization group ( rg ) studies @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( eq . ( [ eq02 ] ) ) can be interpreted as describing a two  component system consisting of interconverting `` real '' ( @xmath39 ) and `` ghost '' , `` virtual '' or ideal  gas particles ( @xmath40 ) ; both kinds of particles have the same kinetic energy , @xmath29 denotes the excess chemical potential of `` real '' particles over `` ideal '' ones , and the total number of particles equals the number of available lattice sites ( semi  grand ",
    "canonical interpretation ) . the semi ",
    "canonical interpretation was also used in early studies of the two  dimensional planar rotator , carried out by the migdal ",
    "kadanoff rg techniques , and aiming at two  dimensional mixtures ( films ) of @xmath41he and @xmath42he @xcite , where non ",
    "magnetic impurities correspond to @xmath41he .",
    "in addition to phase separations , the results in refs .",
    "@xcite show that , in a rgime of low fraction of non  magnetic impurities ,",
    "the paramagnetic phase undergoes a bkt transition .",
    "notice also that the above hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) ) describes a situation of _ annealed _ dilution ; on the other hand , models in the presence of _ quenched _ dilution , and hence the effect of disorder on the bkt transition , have been investigated using the pr model @xcite and very recently the xy model @xcite ; it was found that a sufficiently weak disorder does not destroy the transition , which survives up to a concentration of vacancies close to the percolation threshold .    in this paper",
    ", we present an extensive study of the ferromagnetic lg  pr and lg  xy models , whose hamiltonian can be explicitly written as @xmath43- \\mu n,\\ ] ] in order to gain insights into their critical behaviour .",
    "the models are further simplified by choosing @xmath36 ,",
    "i.e. no pure positional interactions ; let us also remark that two ",
    "component spins are involved in the pr case , whereas xy involves three  component spins but only two of their components are involved in the interaction : in this sense the two models entail different anchorings with respect to the horizontal plane in spin space ; moreover , an even greater variety of anchorings can be realized via the recently introduced generalized xy models @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ simulation ] we discuss details our simulation procedure .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to the discussion of simulation results : we have found evidence pointing to a bkt transition , and used the relevant finite ",
    "size scaling theory to locate it .",
    "possible effects of the chemical potential on the nature of the transition are discussed in section [ conclusion ] , which summarizes our results .",
    "a detailed treatment of grand ",
    "canonical simulations can be found in or via refs . @xcite ; the method outlined here has already been used in our previous studies of other lg models @xcite . to avoid surface effects simulations",
    "were carried out on periodically repeated samples , consisting of @xmath44 sites , @xmath45 ; calculations were carried out in cascade , in order of increasing reduced temperature @xmath46 .",
    "the two basic mc steps used here were canonical and semi  grand ",
    "canonical attempts ; in addition two other features were implemented @xcite : ( i ) when a lattice sites was visited , canonical or semi  grand ",
    "canonical steps were randomly chosen with probabilities @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ; we used @xmath49 , since spin orientation is defined by @xmath50 angles , versus one occupation number and ( ii ) sublattice sweeps ( checkerboard decomposition ) @xcite ; thus each sweep ( or cycle ) consisted of @xmath51 attempts , first @xmath52 attempts where the lattice sites was chosen randomly , then @xmath53 attempts on lattice sites of odd parity , and finally @xmath53 attempts on lattice sites on even parity .",
    "equilibration runs took between @xmath54 and @xmath55 cycles , and production runs took between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; macrostep averages for evaluating statistical errors were taken over @xmath58 cycles .",
    "different random ",
    "number generators were used , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    computed",
    "observables included mean hamiltonian per site and its temperature derivative ( specific heat at constant @xmath29 and @xmath52 ) , density and its derivatives with respect to temperature and chemical potential , defined by @xmath59 @xmath60 and by the fluctuation formulae ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath61,\\ ] ] @xmath62,\\ ] ] @xmath63.\\ ] ] we also calculated mean in  plane magnetic moment per site and in  plane susceptibility defined by @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 taking into account only the in  plane components of the vector spin .",
    "a square sample of @xmath52 sites contains @xmath67 distinct nearest  neighbouring pairs of lattice sites ; we worked out pair occupation probabilities , i.e. the mean fractions @xmath68 of pairs being both empty ( @xmath69 ) , both occupied ( @xmath70 ) , or consisting of an empty and an occupied site ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath72 .",
    "short and long  range positional correlations , were compared by means of the excess quantities @xmath73 collectively denoted by @xmath74 ( notice that these two definitions entail comparable numerical values ) .",
    "quantities such as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the above pair correlations @xmath68 or @xmath74 can be defined as `` fluid  like '' , in the sense that they all go over the trivial constants in the sl limit .",
    "let us also remark that some of the above definitions ( e.g. @xmath78 and @xmath76 ) involve the total potential energy both in the stochastic variable and in the probability measure ( `` explicit '' dependence ) , whereas some other definitions , e.g. @xmath77 or the quantities @xmath68 , involve the total potential energy only in the probability measure ( `` implicit '' dependence ) .",
    "we start by discussing the outcome of the simulations performed for the lg  xy model . results for a number of observables , such as the mean energy per site @xmath79 , and",
    "density @xmath75 ( not reported here ) were found to evolve with temperature in a smooth way , and to be independent of sample sizes ; the derivatives @xmath78 and @xmath76 ( both plotted on fig .",
    "[ cmv ] ) showed a rather smooth trend with temperature , and a `` sharp '' peak at @xmath80 , around which the sample  size dependence of results became _ slightly _ more pronounced ; notice that neither the specific heat nor @xmath76 are exhibiting a divergence as a function of the temperature .    at all investigated temperatures simulation results for @xmath81 ( not reported here ) exhibited the expected power ",
    "law decay with increasing sample size , i.e. they were well fitted by the relation @xmath82 where the ratio @xmath83 was found to increase with temperature ; a spin  wave analysis of the sl  pr ( refs . @xcite and those quoted therein ) predicts a similar sample ",
    "size dependence , in agreement with simulation results for the present model ; furthermore , in the low  temperature limit @xmath84 becomes proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "the behaviours of specific heat and susceptibility ( fig .",
    "[ susceptibility ] ) suggest that the lg  xy model undergoes a bkt  like phase transition .",
    "according to the bkt theory , in the thermodynamic limit , the in  plane susceptibility , @xmath85 , diverges exponentially while approaching the transition temperature @xmath86 in the high temperature region @xcite i.e. @xmath87 ; \\qquad t\\to\\theta^+\\ ] ] and remains infinite in the low temperature region @xmath88 .    for a finite sample with volume @xmath44 ,",
    "the situation is different , since the susceptibility obeys the constraint @xmath89 ; thus @xmath85 is always finite , and its exponential divergence in the transition region is rounded , because of the important finite  size effects .",
    "actually , results for @xmath90 versus temperature ( fig .",
    "[ susceptibility ] ) were found to be independent of sample size when @xmath91 , and showed a recognizable increase with it ( a power ",
    "law dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath92 ) when @xmath93 .    in the critical region ,",
    "i.e. @xmath94 , the correlation length is of the same order as the linear size , @xmath92 , of the system . in this case",
    ", the exponential divergence disappears in the critical region , but a reminiscence of the divergence can still be found in the behaviour of @xmath85 at higher temperatures , where the correlation length is still small compared to large linear system sizes and finite  size effects can be neglected .",
    "we first fitted our mc results obtained for the largest sample size and for temperatures in the range @xmath95 to eq .",
    "( [ chibkt ] ) , and obtained evidence of the exponential divergence of the susceptibility ( see fig . [ susceptibility ] ) , and an estimated transition temperature @xmath96 , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we checked our results by using data on a wider range of temperatures extending up to @xmath99 , and which yielded a consistent result . in",
    "the following we refine our results using a more elaborate method , namely the finite - size scaling theory .",
    "details on this procedure can be found in or via reference @xcite .    in the temperature region where the singularity of @xmath85 is rounded the finite  size scaling theory holds ,",
    "i.e. the correlation length @xmath100 is proportional to the size of the sample , @xmath101 . from the behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath102 , with @xmath103 @xcite",
    ", we end up with @xmath104 where we have omitted the corrections arising from the presence of the background ( analytic ) contributions to the finite  size scaling .",
    "the temperature region around @xmath105 , was analyzed in greater detail , at first by carrying out a linear fit of @xmath90 versus @xmath106 and extracting @xmath107 from the slope ; the values were found to be @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , respectively . a non  linear square fit , based on equation ( [ chieta ] ) , was attempted as well , and yielded results consistent with these ones ; it also proved convenient for result visualization to plot @xmath118 versus @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ eta ] ) .",
    "thus the transition temperature is estimated to be @xmath120 , in agreement with the above mentioned result obtained by fitting the data of the susceptibility in the high temperature region ; at this temperature we expect the value of @xmath107 to be @xmath121 to within statistical errors .",
    "this result shows that the presence of `` vacancies '' in the sample reduce the transition temperature by approximately @xmath122 compared to the sl transition temperature , but does not change its nature .",
    "the pr counterpart of the present model had been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a maximum sample size corresponding to @xmath123 was used .",
    "moreover , in that paper the transition temperature was estimated as the temperature where @xmath85 started exhibiting a power  law dependency on @xmath92 .",
    "calculations had been carried out with two different values of the chemical potential , @xmath38 and @xmath124 , respectively ( see e.g. table [ t01 ] ) ; the transition had been found to survive in both cases ( even with a slightly negative value ) , and the transition temperature had been found to increase with increasing @xmath29 , in qualitative agreement with previous rg results @xcite .    .",
    "comparison of the transition temperatures , @xmath125 , of the lg ",
    "pr model obtained in ref . @xcite and those obtained using the finite  size scaling presented in the present paper . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for further comparison we reexamined the results obtained in the case of the lg ",
    "pr model in two ways .",
    "on the one hand , the above finite  size analysis was applied to the simulation data produced in ref .",
    "the transition temperatures , reported in table [ t01 ] , corresponding to the two values of the chemical potential used were found to be lower than the ones reported previously .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath29dependence of the temperature was similar for both methods .",
    "on the other , in order to achieve a better comparison with the present case , simulations were run _",
    "anew _ for the case @xmath126 , using same sample sizes as for the lg ",
    "xy counterpart ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities of interest were found to behave qualitatively in a similar fashion as those obtained in the framework of the xy model .    a detailed investigation of the susceptibility via the above finite ",
    "size scaling procedure resulted in a bkt  like transition with a transition temperature estimate of @xmath128 , corresponding to a particle density of @xmath129 .",
    "the transition temperature in this case was found to be @xmath122 lower than the case of the planar rotator sl counterpart .    as for other fluid  like quantities obtained within the framework of lg  xy , the plot of the derivative @xmath130 ( fig .",
    "[ proba ] ) against the temperature exhibited a smooth evolution , a broad maximum at @xmath131 and a comparatively weak sample ",
    "size dependence ; pair occupation probabilities @xmath68 were found to be essentially independent of sample size , similarly to quantities such as @xmath79 and @xmath75 ; their results for the largest sample size @xmath132 are presented in fig .",
    "[ proba ] as well ; the three quantities evolve with temperature in a gradual and monotonic way , and their plots suggest inflection points between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , roughly corresponding to the maximum in @xmath77 .",
    "short and long  range positional correlations have been compared via the excess quantities @xmath74 , whose simulation results for the largest sample size are reported in fig .",
    "[ rstar ] , showing a broad maximum well above the transition temperature ; notice also that @xmath135 remains rather small , reflecting the absence of a purely positional term in the interaction potential . in general it has been found that the obtained properties exhibit a recognizable similarity with with the counterparts for the isotropic lg ",
    "pr model @xcite .",
    "some other remarks are appropriate , concerning the temperature dependence of fluid  like properties ; let us recall that our potential model contains no explicit positional interaction , i.e @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eqpot01 ] ) , so that positional properties are essentially driven by the orientation - dependent pair potential .",
    "similarities and differences in the above plots for @xmath78 and @xmath76 on the one hand ( fig .",
    "[ cmv ] ) , and @xmath77 or @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ proba ] ) on the other hand , can then be correlated with the  implicit  or `` explicit '' dependencies of the named quantities on the potential energy ( see remarks at the end of the previous section ) ; the pair interaction energy changes most rapidly at @xmath136 , and this is reflected by narrow peaks in @xmath78 and @xmath76 ; conversely , quantities with `` implicit dependence '' on the pair interaction energy are less affected by the change , as shown by a broader peak at higher temperature @xmath137 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated two magnetic lattice  gas models living on two  dimensional lattices , i.e. pr and xy , respectively .",
    "we have studied both lattice ",
    "gas models , in the absence of a pure positional interaction , using semi  grand ",
    "canonical monte carlo simulation . in the case of zero chemical potential",
    "a number of thermodynamic quantities observable , including some characteristic of fluid systems , were computed . in general",
    "it has been found that the obtained properties for both models exhibit a recognizable qualitative similarity .",
    "results for the susceptibility yield consistent evidence of the existence of a bkt transition , suggesting the estimates @xmath138 and @xmath139 for the transition temperatures , with corresponding densities at transition @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained in the framework of models describing quenched dilution ; the ratio of the transition temperatures of the lg models to the sl ones is approximately @xmath142 .",
    "the peak of the specific heat falls closer to @xmath143 than for the sl counterpart ; this can be interpreted as reflecting the fact that , since @xmath36 , the strengthening of short  range orientational correlations also brings about a more rapid increase of density , and hence , in turn , of @xmath79 .    as for",
    "the possible @xmath29dependence of the present results , let us first notice that , since @xmath144 , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath85 , and hence @xmath145 , are increasing functions of @xmath29 . on the other hand , the ground  state energy for the sl counterpart is @xmath146 per site , where @xmath147 ; thus the lattice is essentially saturated when @xmath148 and @xmath29 exceeds a few multiples of @xmath149 ( say @xmath29 ranging between @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) ; at the other extreme , when @xmath29 is negative and of comparable magnitude , one expects an essentially empty lattice , where no bktlt should survive .",
    "moreover , a bktlt may still survive if @xmath29 is negative but not too large in magnitude ; this conjecture is supported by rg studies for the lg ",
    "pr @xcite , and was confirmed by the simulation results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it also agrees with the conclusions of references @xcite for two  dimensional magnets with quenched dilution ; for large negative @xmath29 , the named rg treatments predict phase separation , i.e. a first  order transition between a bkt and a paramagnetic phase , and eventually the disappearance of the bkt phase .",
    "we expect to investigate the @xmath29dependence of the transition temperature in a more detailed way in future work .",
