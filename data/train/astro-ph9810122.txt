    "the black hole binary cyg x-1 has complex x - ray emission variability at all the time scales from milliseconds to years ( cf .",
    "review by tanaka & lewin 1995 , van der klis 1995 ) . on the short time scale of subsecond the hard x - rays from cyg x-1",
    "show large - amplitude chaotic fluctuations .",
    "the studies of temporal properties of the rapid variability in the hard x - rays should be a hopeful method to understand the properties of the compact object . in the low state ( ls )",
    ", the variability of x - rays could be described approximately as the superposition of individual shots ( terrel 1972 ; oda 1977 ; sutherland et al .",
    "1978 ; miyamoto et al . 1988 ; miyamoto et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the properties of the rapid fluctuation or shot had been studied from acf ( autocorrelation function ) and pds ( power density spectrum ) based on the supposition of randomly occurring shots ( nolan et al .",
    "1981 ; lochner et al . 1991 ) .",
    "negoro , miyamoto and kitamoto ( 1994 ) ( hereafter nmk ) obtained average shot profiles from a _ ginga _ observation of cyg x-1 in the low state by superposing many shots through aligning their peaks and found that the shot profile was approximately represented by a sum of two exponentials with time constants of about 0.1 and 1 s and that the average hardness during the shot is lower than that of steady emission .",
    "quite a few models have been proposed as the mechanism for creating the rapid fluctuations , such as the hot spot model in the inner part of disk ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; shibazaki & hoshi 1975 ; rothschild et al .",
    "1974 ; miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ) , the disturbance propagation model ( manmoto et al .",
    "1996 ) and the model of magnetic flare ( galeev et al . 1979 ; pudritz & fahlman 1982 ; nolan et al . 1981 ; lochner et al .",
    "the rapid hardening of the spectra at the peak obtained from the study of average shot features by nmk is difficult for the magnetic flare model to explain .",
    "recently , the observed phase lags and variability coherence between high- and low - energy bands have ruled out the magnetic flare model and the models of hot spot , and it seems that the simple propagation model could qualitatively represent the properties of x - ray fluctuation ( nowak et al .",
    "1997 ; vauhgan & nowak 1997 ) .    up to now , the shot properties have only been studied with observations in the low state of cyg x-1 .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "mission ( bradt et al . 1993 ) provided a unique opportunity for shot property studies in cyg x-1 with microsecond resolution observations when cyg x-1 experienced transitions from the low state to the high state , and then from the high state to the low state ( belloni et al .",
    "1996 ; cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b , zhang cui et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present our analysis of the structures of x - ray shots in the different states of cyg x-1 with an improved method from _ rxte _ observations .",
    "there are fifteen public observations with _ rxte _ from may 22 to august 15 , 1996 , which covered transition states ( is ) and high state ( hs ) of cyg x-1 ( belloni et al .",
    "1996 ; cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "the pca observations were carried out consistently with three modes .",
    "two of the modes were selected for analyzing shot structure with one millisecond time bin in this work : one is the event - mode with sixteen energy bands covering @xmath0 kev with the time resolution of 16 @xmath1s ; the other is the single - bit mode including @xmath2 kev and @xmath3 kev energy bands with the time bin of 125 @xmath1s .",
    "the data from two of pca/_rxte _ observations on 1996 dec .",
    "17 when cyg x-1 stayed in the low state , were also used in this study . in those data ,",
    "the energy bands of single - bit modes of pca are @xmath4 kev and @xmath5 kev with the time bin of 125 @xmath1s .",
    "the chosen data have been further binned with a @xmath6 s time resolution .",
    "the collimator response correction and barycentric correction are applied . in the study of the average features of shots from a bright source , such as cyg x-1",
    ", the background can be negligible .",
    "the effect of dead time can be also neglected because the real count rate is not very high and the time bin is much larger than the 10@xmath1s dead time ( zhang 1995 ) .      according to nmk",
    ", shots were selected by the criteria that their peak count of @xmath7 kev x - rays should be @xmath8 times larger than that of the local mean counts obtained in the 32 s interval and should be the maximum within the neighboring 8 s on both sides . the average shot profile with the 15.6 ms time bin in the @xmath7 kev energy band and that in the five subdivision bands ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 kev ) were obtained separately by superposing the count profiles in each band of selected shots through aligning their peak bins determined by the total light curve in @xmath7 kev . since the differences between the times of shot peaks in different energy bands were not taken into account and that the shots near which there were other smaller shots within 8 s were not excluded in the nmk s procedure , the average shot structure may deviate from the truth .",
    "li and fenimore ( 1996 ) ( hereafter lf ) proposed a peak - finding algorithm to analyze the @xmath11-ray burst temporal structure . in this algorithm ,",
    "a candidate peak is selected as the bin having more count ( @xmath12 ) than the neighboring bins ( both sides ) , and then both sides of each candidate peak is searched for the bins with count @xmath13 ( at @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( at @xmath16 ) so that the condition @xmath17 is satisfied . when both @xmath13 and @xmath15 are found the candidate peak",
    "is selected as the true peak of a pulse .",
    "this algorithm is sensitive to selecting the shots but the statistical fluctuation of count has more influence on its result .    in order to analyze light curves with a time resolution down to 1 ms and low counts in each bin , we combined the two methods mentioned above and made necessary improvements in our work . to suppress the effects of statistical fluctuation ,",
    "the larger time bin of 10 @xmath18 @xmath6s ( @xmath19 ms ) light curves is used initially to find the shot peak according to the lf method . then each selected peak bin and its neighboring bins ( both sides )",
    "are divided into thirty bins with time bin of @xmath6 s ( @xmath20 ms ) .",
    "a shot peak is selected from the thirty bins by using nmk method in which the average count is used as the count of the steady emission in the interval of 1 s around the peak .",
    "this selecting process has been carried out separately in each energy band of three subdivisions between 2 - 60 kev .",
    "a shot peak candidate is selected as a true peak if it coincidences in all the three bands within 30 ms . to reduce the effects of shot overlap",
    ", we excluded any shots near which other shot was found within one second . because there are time delays between x - ray intensity variations at different energies , the shot peaks were determined and aligned to obtain the average shot profiles separately in each energy band .    the improved method used in this work , the nmk method and the lf method",
    "have been compared by simulations with a simulated light curve which has a similar count rate of steady and the shot peak as observed by pca/_rxte _ and a shot profile of exponential decay .",
    "the obtained average shots are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "it shows that the average shot feature obtained by our method is more similar to the given one than that of the nmk and lf methods .",
    "the average shot was not significantly changed as the value of parameter @xmath21 in the selection condition ( 1 ) varied from 2.0 to 4.0 .",
    "it means that the shots selected under the condition of @xmath21=2.0 are most likely to be rapid flares with time scale of 10ms , which significantly exceed the steady emission , rather than statistical fluctuations . in the following analysis , @xmath21 is set to be 2.0 .",
    "it can be seen that the obtained average shots tend to be expanded because of the selecting errors of peak bins due to their count fluctuation .",
    "the peak bin is excluded in our studies because its count has a systematic error caused by the criterion of shot peak selecting .",
    "we divided the selected shots into two groups with high and low peak counts , and found that the average shot profiles were very similar between them , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "it means that the shot profile in one state does not correlate significantly with the peak counts .",
    "a similar result was also obtained by nmk from a _ ginga _ observation when cyg x-1 stayed in the low state .",
    "we used the full width of half maximum ( fwhm ) of autocorrelation to describe the duration of shot .",
    "the shots were divided into two groups with duration being longer or shorter than 130 ms .",
    "the average shots of the different groups are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it can be seen that , except the duration , the shot features are quite similar between the long and short duration groups .",
    "the higher the energy bands are , the more similar the two groups are .",
    "the difference between the two groups can be attributed mainly to the slow variation .",
    "the rapid decay processes are almost the same in the two groups .",
    "the hardness evolution during the shots in the two groups is similar too .",
    "therefore , the average shot obtained by superposing all the selected shots in our studies can reflect the main characteristics of shots with the different durations and peak intensities , especially the rapid variability properties .",
    "the present method was also applied to the crab data obtained with pca/_rxte_. the average short time scale ( @xmath22 10 ms ) flare obtained is similar to the one of the two peak average pulse profile found by folding with period of 33.4 ms , in duration and rough shape , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "it can be found some smaller flares which reflect the periodic double - peak pulse structure of crab .",
    "it means that the flares selected , using our method , are mostly pulses of crab . but the double - peak structure found by using our method is not as clear as by period folding , it is due to most of periodic pulse selected by us has only one peak of its double - peak pulse which has significantly positive fluctuation to be selected by our criterion .",
    "it shows that our method can select the real rapid flares and obtain the rough average shape of flares which reflect some properties , such as main flare s rise of the flares in a real light curve obtained by pca/_rxte _ in time scale of @xmath22 10 ms .",
    "the average profiles of x - ray shots have been obtained from pca/_rxte _ observations in the low - to - high transition , high , high - to - low transition and the low states of cyg x-1 by our improved superposing procedure described in the last section and shown in figure 5 .    in the transition states ,",
    "the front of shot could be simply represented by a single exponential .",
    "however , in the high and low states , a sum of two exponentials which correspond to the rapid and slow variability respectively , is necessary .",
    "the formula for fitting is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the rapid process of shot ; @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 correspond to a slow process of shot ; @xmath28 is the time relative to the shot peak .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the shots , within 0.45 s or 450 bins with 1 ms time bin on both sides of shot peak , are summarized in table 1 .",
    "it shows that the rise of the average shot is slower than its decay .",
    "and the difference between the slopes of rise and decay in the high energy band is more significant than that in the low energy band .",
    "the comparison of shot features in the different states and energy bands are shown in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "it can be found that the profiles of shots depend upon state and energy .",
    "the shot duration is the shortest in the high state and the longest in the low state .",
    "the shot in the high energy band is narrower than that in the lower energy bands .",
    "we also found that the time constant for the rapid decay in the high energy bands is always about 6 ms in the three states .",
    "the distributions of the time lags between the shots of the high and low energy bands in the different states are shown in figure 8 .",
    "the time lag is determined by the maximum of the cross - correlation function between the shot profiles in the two energy bands .",
    "the average lags are listed in table 2 , where the errors are estimated by the bootstrap method ( diaconis @xmath29 efron , 1983 ) .",
    "it can be seen from figure 8 and table 2 that there exists , on the average , a delay of high - energy photons relative to low - energy ones in the x - ray shots of cyg x-1 in each state , and in the transition sates the distributions of time lags are most asymmetric and the average lags are more larger than that in the high and low states .",
    "figure 9 shows the hardness evolution of average shots in the different states .",
    "the zero points of time in fig.9 correspond to the shot peaks . to study the hardness during a shot",
    ", the shot peaks in each energy bands have been taken as the bins which are the maximum count bins in the summed up shots of every energy bands in 2 - 60 kev . and",
    "the time bin of light curves are set to be 10 @xmath18 @xmath6 s to suppress statistical fluctuation .",
    "from fig.9 one can see that in the high state the hardness during a shot is higher than that of the steady emission around the shot .",
    "however , in the low and transition states , the hardness is lower than that of the steady emission and the hardness reduces significantly about 100 ms before the shot peak and rises rapidly to the maximum near the peak .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained by nmk .",
    "the hardness ratios for the net shots after subtracting the steady emission in the different states are shown in figure 10 .",
    "it shows that after a drop the hardness rises gradually and reaches to a flat top during the shot in the low or transition states .",
    "we take the region from @xmath30 s to @xmath31 s and from 0.2 s to 0.4 s from the shot peak as the off - shot region and the interval between @xmath31 s and 0.2 s around the peak as the shot region .",
    "the net - shot spectra can be obtained by subtracting the off - shot spectra from the shot spectra .",
    "the average net - shot spectra in a state can be obtained by merging all the net - shot spectra in the state and the average off - shot spectra obtained by merging all the off - shot spectra .",
    "figure 11 shows the obtained net - shot and off - shot spectra in each state separately .",
    "figure 12 shows the net - shot spectra in the different states for comparison .",
    "it can be seen that the spectra of net - shot in the low state is the hardest one .",
    "the shot durations found from observation of pca/_rxte _ are significantly shorter than that obtained with _ ginga _ data by nmk . the longer time constant of shots found from pca/_rxte _ observations is similar to the shorter time constant obtained by nmk , while the shorter time constant obtained by our studies is shorter than the time resolution of _ ginga_. the typical interval between the two successive shots is about @xmath32 s. the longer duration found by nmk could be due to the relatively lower time resolution in the _ ginga _ data and the overlapping effect of shots in their superposing process .",
    "the average shot profile obtained by superposing the simulated data shows that such methods tend to smooth the structure of individual shot .",
    "although the profiles of shot are not identical as shown in figure 3 , the shots with different profiles share some common features , such as the hardness evolution properties and rapid decay within @xmath22 20 ms of shot peak , are reflected by the average shot .",
    "the shot features vary in different energy bands even in the same state .",
    "the duration of shot in the high energy band is shorter than that in the low energy bands , as seen in figure 6 , and it is more significant in the transition and high states than that in the low state . it is not consistent with the prediction of the models in which x - ray shots are produced by inverse - compton scattering of flares of soft radiation .",
    "because the higher the energy of photons is , the more the scatterings for the low energy photons are needed ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; hua et al .",
    "1997 ; bottcher & liang 1998 ) .",
    "the reirradiation of the high energy photons by cool matter on disk could be a explanation of that the duration of shot is larger in the low energy bands than that in the high energy bands , but it will cause a lose of the near - perfect coherence between the low- and high - energy x - ray photons observed in x - ray emission of cyg x-1 ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) . the propagation model ( manmoto et al .",
    "1996 ) assumes that an x - ray shot comes from a disturbance added onto the advection - dominated disk at large radii , which propagates inward and is reflected at the innermost part of the disk as an outgoing shock wave .",
    "this model can explain some shot features obtained by nmk .",
    "in the disturbance propagation model the observed main shot properties , i.e. the shot duration is shorter and its peak is later than that in the low energy , could be naturely attributed to that the higher temperature the region is , the more inner and smaller it is , if the temperature rises gradually from the outer to inner region of the disk . but the propagation model expects the resulting light profile to be roughly symmetric with respect to the shot peak , i.e. , the rise and decay parts should be roughly the same , which is not consistent with the asymmetric structure obtained from the observation of _ rxte _ presented in this paper .",
    "our results show that some temporal and spectral characteristics of x - ray shots of cyg x-1 are remarkably different in the different states .",
    "the shot duration is the shortest in the high state and the longest in the low state .",
    "the evolution of hardness during a shot in the high state is significantly different from that in the transition and low states . it could be a new criterion to distinguish the high state from the other states of cyg x-1 and interesting to apply this criterion to other black hole binaries to judge their states .",
    "no proposed shot model has predicated such a difference in temporal and spectral properties between the high state and other states .",
    "the factor of more effective cooling in the disturbance has been used to explain the pre - peak drop of hardness during a shot in the transition and low states , but it could not explain the hardness during a shot being higher than that of the steady emission in the high state .",
    "it may imply that the environment of the region where the rapid fluctuation happens is changed with the spectral state .",
    "the observed hard x - ray emission may mainly be produced by comptonization in a hot advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) or an accretion disk corona ( adc ) ( dove et el .",
    "the joint region between the innermost orbit of the disk and the hot corona could be the place where most violent disturbances occur and x - ray shots come from . in the low or intermediate state , the hot flow or corona",
    "can be seen as a sphere surrounding the black hole horizon with an extending accretion disk and the joint region is the outer part of the hot corona with a lower temperature of electrons . on the other hand , in the high state , the adaf or adc",
    "is restricted to the corona above the disk ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) and the joint region is then the inner part of the corona with a higher temperature .",
    "the geometries of hot corona may explain the difference of hardness evolution in the different states .",
    "the shot duration may relate to the size of the hot corona .",
    "the shot durations obtained in the different states implies that the size of corona is smaller in the high state than that in the transition states , and it is the largest in the low state , which is also consistent with the adaf or adc model .",
    "the time lag of high energy photons relative to low energy ones is a useful probe of the dynamics of the hard x - ray production region .",
    "although a time delay of x - ray shots in the high energy band is , on the average , observed for each state of cyg x-1 ( see table 2 ) , which is consistent with results from the fourier cross spectral analyses , but the features of the distributions of time lags are complicated and difficult to be explained with any simple production model .",
    "a futher sdudy of the time lag distributions is in the process .",
    "we thank james lochnner for his help in obtaining and reducing the data , shuangnan zhang for his valuable comments , and fanjin lu and yong chen for their worthful discussions .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
