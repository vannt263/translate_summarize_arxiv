    "( 2000 ) noted that two discrete egret sources , 3eg j2021 + 3716 and , are consistent with the cos  b location ( pollack et al . 1985 ) , and that the weaker of these two , , is coincident with a blazar - like radio source  ( g74.87 + 1.22 ) which they proposed as its most likely identification .",
    "the temporal variability and broad - band spectral properties of  are consistent with those of other egret blazars .",
    "leaving aside the novelty of a blazar located behind the galactic plane , the identification of any particular egret source with a blazar is generally a probabilistic claim , since only a small fraction of known blazars were seen to be active in @xmath0-rays during the egret survey .",
    "furthermore , there is clearly a galactic population of @xmath0-ray sources at low latitude that are mostly unidentified .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ probability that the blazar  is the correct identification of the egret source 3eg j2016 + 3657 was estimated following the method of mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as @xmath2 , even though the _ a priori _ probability that egret will detect a random radio source having the properties of  is only 5.8% .",
    "[ while the distinction between these two types of probability should be clear , they are sometimes confused , causing serious mistakes to be made in diverse fields of inquiry , as was illustrated by good ( 1995 ) . ]    in this particular case , the reliability of the identification of  with  is as good as that of the well - identified egret blazars listed by mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but it is slightly diminished by the location of  in the galactic plane , where an increased density of @xmath0-ray sources resides which have proven even more difficult to identify than the blazars .",
    "one way to further test the association of  with  is to conduct a deep search for plausible alternative @xmath0-ray source counterparts within the error circle . in the case of",
    ", we report such an investigation here which consists of complete optical spectroscopic identifications of all soft and hard x - ray sources in the vicinity of  to faint limits which , by process of elimination , leaves  as the most likely counterpart of .",
    "the error circle of  was covered by several imaging x - ray observations , including the _ einstein _ ipc ( wilson 1980 ) , the  pspc , the  hri , and the  gis .",
    "the results of these observations were described by mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in figures 1 and 2",
    ", we show the  pspc and hri images with x - ray sources numbered as in that paper .",
    "table 1 gives positions of the brightest sources in the hri image , or in the pspc in the case of sources not covered by the hri .",
    "the uncertainties in position are statistical only , and do not include any systematic offsets ( see below ) .",
    "the limiting hri count rate of @xmath3  s@xmath4 corresponds to an unabsorbed 0.12.4  kev flux of @xmath5 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath4 in the case of a thermal plasma of temperature @xmath7  k and @xmath8  @xmath6 as might be appropriate for stellar coronal sources , or @xmath9 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath4 in the case of a @xmath10 power law and the total galactic @xmath11 of @xmath12  @xmath6 , which might apply to distant galactic or extragalactic sources .",
    "of the 14 x - ray sources in table  1 , eight were identified in mukherjee et al .",
    "we were able to complete the identifications either from positional coincidences with bright stars ( figure 3 ) or by obtaining spectra of the nearest optical object to the x - ray position using ccd spectrographs on either the mdm 2.4 m telescope or the kpno 2.1 m telescope in 2000 june .",
    "the only source with no optical counterpart is the well - known supernova remnant ctb 87 .",
    "figure  4 shows ccd images from the 2.4 m telescope that can serve as finding charts for the fainter counterparts , and figure  5 shows our collection of optical spectra .",
    "table 1 lists r magnitudes either measured from our ccd images for the faint objects , or from the usno  a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1996 ) for the brighter stars .",
    "optical positions were also taken from the usno  a2.0 or from the simbad data base .",
    "the agreement between optical and x - ray positions is excellent .",
    "figure  6 illustrates the offsets between x - ray and optical positions .",
    "there is evidently a systematic error in the hri aspect solution of @xmath13 , which accounts for the tight group of sources displaced from the origin with small statistical errors .",
    "such a systematic error is typical for  and not of concern here .",
    "entries in table  1 and in figures 1 and 2 follow the numbering scheme in mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in this section ,",
    "we give details on each of these sources using the same identifying numbers .",
    "_ 1 . ctb 87 _ : this well - studied supernova remnant , also known as g74.9 + 1.2 , is an extended radio source with a flat spectrum , filled center , and high polarization .",
    "it is comparable to the crab in its radio properties ( duin et al .",
    "1975 ; weiler & shaver 1978 ; wilson 1980 ) , but it is characterized as a `` non crab - like plerion '' by woltjer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who enumerate a class which is weak in x - rays relative to radio and lack an observed pulsar , at least so far .",
    "its h  i absorption spectrum indicates a distance of 12  kpc .",
    "an association of a snr with an egret source can be hypothesized either due to an embedded @xmath0-ray pulsar , of which several are known , or to the decay of @xmath14 s created in the snr shock ( montmerle 1979 ; aharonian et al .",
    "1994 ) , a theory to account for unidentified egret sources which has yet to be verified observationally .",
    "wilson ( 1980 ) argued that the x - ray luminosity of ctb 87 , which is 100 times less than that of the crab , implies that the spin - down power of the embedded pulsar must be correspondingly less , @xmath15  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "it would require a factor of 2 more power than this to be emitted in the egret energy band alone to account for the egret measured flux of @xmath16 ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath4 from 3eg  j2016 + 3657 .",
    "this argument is insensitive to distance as long as the x - ray synchrotron nebula is considered a calorimeter of the present pulsar power .",
    "alternatively , gaensler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that the spin - down power of the pulsar in g74.9 + 1.2 is much larger , @xmath17  ergs  s@xmath4 based on the similarity of its radio luminosity to that of the crab .",
    "these differences of opinion attest to our incomplete understanding of the physics of pulsar synchrotron nebulae . for the purposes of this investigation ,",
    "it matters little because the crab pulsar itself channels only about 0.2% of its spin - down power into @xmath0-rays .",
    "even the larger power estimate of gaensler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is less than half the crab spin - down power , and the distance is 6 times greater .",
    "the flux from such a pulsar would then be at most 1/70 times that of the crab .",
    "egret would not detect such a source , especially in the confusing cygnus region .",
    "if , instead , ctb 87 hosts a geminga - like pulsar whose energy is no longer trapped by the nebula , and is maximally efficient in the production of @xmath0-rays , then we would expect a spin - down power of only @xmath18  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "such a pulsar is inadequate to explain the flux of 3eg  j2016 + 3657 unless it were at @xmath19  pc , which is certainly ruled out by the h  i and x - ray measured column density to the snr .",
    "thus , the remnant ctb 87 is unlikely to be responsible for the egret source 3eg j2016 + 3657 .",
    "it is doubtful that any pulsar at a distance of 12  kpc was detected by egret .",
    "_ 2 . rx j2015.6 + 2711 _ : this source has the optical spectrum of a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , probably of the magnetic type since its he  ii  @xmath204686 emission line is as strong as h@xmath214861 ( see figure 5 ) . the optical spectrum is clearly reddened , so it may be more distant than 1  kpc .",
    "there is no reason to suppose that this , or any other cataclysmic variable , is the source of , as none of the dozens of nearby cvs have been detected by egret ( barrett et al .",
    "1995 ; schlegel et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "_ 3 . b2013 + 370 _ : the 2  jy radio source  ( g74.87 + 1.22 ) is a well - studied compact , flat - spectrum radio source that was first noticed during the study of the snr ctb 87 ( duin et al . 1975 ) .",
    "its multiwavelength properties were compiled by mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who noted , in agreement with previous authors , that it has the standard radio properties of a blazar , but now with the addition of optical and x - ray evidence .",
    "although the galactic extinction in this direction is considerable , @xmath22 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , we were able to get excellent @xmath23 band images of it using the mdm 2.4 m telescope on 2000 april 24 , and again on 2000 july 17 .",
    "the seeing on both occasions was @xmath24 .",
    "an unresolved object appears in these images less than @xmath25 from the vlbi radio position ( duin et al , 1975 ) , and it is clearly variable as shown in figure  4 .",
    "using landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars , we measure calibrated magnitudes of @xmath26 on april 24 , and @xmath27 on july 17 . [ a preliminary magnitude of @xmath28",
    "was reported by mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the april image , which at that time was still uncalibrated ] . after correcting for galactic absorption ,",
    "these magnitudes become @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these results are in accord with the multiwavelength spectral and variability properties of typical blazars .",
    "we note that this object was also probably detected in the @xmath31 band by geldzahler et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , who found @xmath32 , while also noting that it appeared extended .",
    "our @xmath23-band images show that the object closest to the radio position is unresolved and variable , while a faint star @xmath33 to the northwest of it was likely responsible for the extended appearance in the geldzahler et al . image .",
    "mukherjee et al . ( 2000 ) argued that  has all the characteristics of a compact , extragalactic , non - thermal radio source that is typical of the many extragalactic sources seen by egret .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for the details .",
    "the detection of optical variability reported here bolsters those arguments .",
    "although there is only weak evidence for gamma - ray variability from , the data allow variability by at least a factor of two , which is greater than the optical amplitude seen so far .",
    "_ 4 . rx j2015.4 + 2711 _ : this source appears to be a garden variety cv with strong emission lines of h and he  i , and is probably the closest of the three cvs discovered in this study because it is the least reddened .",
    "_ 5 . rx j2015.6 + 2704 _ : this is another reddened cv , with emission lines of h and weak he  i. it is interesting to note that the expected number of cvs in one  hri field in the galactic plane is @xmath34 assuming a local space density of @xmath35  pc@xmath36 ( patterson 1984 ) , and that in the galactic plane  can detect them to a distance of @xmath37  kpc .",
    "therefore , the probability of detecting at least three cvs in one field is not so small , @xmath38 .",
    "based on a survey of _ einstein _ x - ray sources in the galactic plane , hertz et al .",
    "( 1990 ) claimed that the space density of cvs is several times higher , @xmath39  pc@xmath36 , which would also be consistent with our result .",
    "hd 228766 _ : originally classified as wn7 , this is actually a binary o star system ( hiltner 1951 ; walborn 1973 ) with a period of 10.74  d , consisting of an o7.5 primary and an o5.5f secondary ( massey & conti 1977 ) .",
    "a minimum mass of @xmath40 for each star was derived by massey & conti , who also estimated a mass loss rate of @xmath41  yr@xmath4 from the of star .",
    "such high mass loss rates are of interest in relation to the theory of white & chen ( 1992 ) which predicts @xmath14-decay @xmath0-rays of as much as @xmath42  ergs  s@xmath4 from shocks in the densest parts of the stellar wind .",
    "however , at the distance of 3.5  kpc ( chlebowski , harnden , & sciortino 1989 ) , such a flux from hd 228766 is not likely to be detectable by egret .",
    "it is variable between two x - ray observations separated by 5 months .",
    "hd 193077 _ : also cataloged as wr 138 ( van der hucht et al .",
    "1981 ) , this star is of subtype wn5+ob .",
    "a probable binary period of @xmath43  yr was measured by annuk ( 1990 ) .",
    "it is thought to be a member of the cyg ob1 association at @xmath44  pc ( hamann , koesterke , & wessolowski 1993 ) .",
    "these authors also derived a mass loss rate of @xmath45  yr@xmath4 and a terminal wind velocity of 1500  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the association of wr 138 with  was suggested by kaul & mitra ( 1997 ) , and by romero , benaglia , & torres ( 1999 ) . as the brightest  x - ray source in the field of  this is perhaps the best of the wolf - rayet candidates , although it is near the edge of the error circle .",
    "rx j2016.6 + 3705 _ : this is a g star of magnitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 that has a typical x - ray flux for its spectral type .",

    "rx j2016.8 + 3657 _ : this late k star shows a hint of h@xmath49 emission in its spectrum , which may be associated with enhanced coronal x - ray emission .",
    "hd 228600 _ : this is a star of unknown spectral type with magnitudes @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "hd 192641 _ : this is wr 137 , a binary of type wc7+ob .",
    "it is a weak x - ray source , which we list in table  1 because it was also suggested as a possible wr counterpart of  by kaul & mitra ( 1997 ) and romero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "hd 228860 _ : this member of the cyg ob1 association is of spectral type b0.5 iv ( humphreys 1978 ) .",
    "it is almost certainly the x - ray source at the eastern edge of the egret error circle , even though its position is poorly determined this far off axis .",

    "it is also a variable x - ray source .",
    "as previously concluded by mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we still find that the most likely identification for  is the blazar .",
    "we have obtained additional identifications of x - ray sources in the field to a flux limit of @xmath5 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath4 for nearby , relatively unabsorbed sources , or @xmath9 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath4 for extragalactic or very distant hard x - ray sources .",
    "the snr ctb 87 is disfavored because of its extreme distance , and the fact that energetic pulsars are known to channel only a small fraction , @xmath52 of their power into high - energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "cataclysmic variables , which comprise the majority of the newly identified sources in this field , are not known @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "similarly , while there are several wolf - rayet and binary o stars in this field , it remains to be demonstrated that such stars contribute at all to the egret source population .",
    "our complete set of optical identifications also rules out the alternative of a geminga - like pulsar at a distance less than 500  pc , which would be the maximum distance at which it could be responsible for the @xmath0-ray flux of .",
    "the  pspc flux limit for identified sources in this field for an assumed blackbody spectrum of @xmath53  k and @xmath8  @xmath6 is @xmath54 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath4 , or 50 times fainter than geminga .",
    "only if @xmath11 is as high as @xmath55  @xmath6 could such a pulsar have escaped detection . even then , the @xmath0-ray properties of  ( steep spectrum , variable ) are unlike those of intermediate - age pulsars .",
    "since there is a bona - fide blazar available for identification with , it remains our candidate of choice .",
    "the probability of finding an egret blazar only @xmath56 from the galactic equator can be estimated from the total number of relatively well identified blazars , 66 , in the third egret catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "this implies an expectation of just one blazar within the zone @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we should not be surprised to have found this one , but we should not expect that blazars will make a significant contribution to the low - latitude egret population .",
