    "heating can have a profound effect on nuclear shapes , causing a variety of shape transitions .",
    "experimentally , such responses to the thermal excitations have been studied from the shapes of the giant dipole resonances(gdr ) built on excited states @xcite .",
    "theoretically , they have been studied earlier in a finite temperature non - relativistic microscopic hartree - fock @xcite and hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) framework @xcite with a pairing plus quadrupole ( p+q ) interaction . for",
    "the nuclei studied , it has been found that while the superfluid nuclear phase has transition to the normal phase typically at t@xmath6 mev , the deformed shapes have transition to the spherical ones at a higher temperature , mostly between t@xmath7 to 1.8 mev for rare - earth nuclei .",
    "these calculations , however , have some limitations ; they employ a simplistic model hamiltonian in a limited model space , an inert core is assumed , moreover , the coulomb interaction has not been taken into account realistically .",
    "the understanding of the universal pattern of the mean field shape evolution with temperature has also been tried in a macroscopic approach @xcite commonly referred to as the landau theory of phase transition . a quantitative estimate of the persistence of the ground state deformation @xcite with temperature is however seen to be missing in some cases .    recently , we have undertaken a study @xcite of the thermal evolution of nuclear properties , particularly the phase transition in the nuclear shape and the superfluidity in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory .",
    "the pairing effects have been included in the bcs approximation . the rmf theory @xcite has proved to be an extremely powerful tool in explaining the gross properties of nuclei over the entire periodic table . in contrast to the non - relativistic models , this theory employs a single set of parameters to explain all these properties .",
    "moreover , in such calculations , the model space used is sufficiently large and all the nucleons are treated on equal footing .",
    "the calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are performed for only two rare - earth nuclei , namely , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is found that the phase transition for the nuclear shape from the prolate to the spherical occurs at a temperature significantly higher than that obtained in the ( p+q ) model and that the transition is relatively smooth .",
    "a very recent calculation by egido et al @xcite in a nonrelativistic approach but with the realistic gogny force reveals that the characteristics of the nuclear shape transition are very similar to those obtained in the rmf theory .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a more systematic study of the shape transition for the rare - earth nuclei in the relativistic mean field theory in the present paper .",
    "for this purpose , we have considered various even - even isotopes of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . a more quantitative study , particularly of the shape transitions , calls for the inclusion of thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , this is too computer intensive and are not included in the present paper .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we discuss the theoretical framework briefly in section ii .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section iii and the concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we employ the nonlinear @xmath13 version of the rmf theory @xcite . the lagrangian density for the nucleon - meson many body system is taken as @xmath14    the arrows indicate isovector quantities .",
    "the mesons included in the description are the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons . for an appropriate description of the nuclear surfaces",
    "@xcite , a non - linear scalar self - interaction term @xmath18 of the @xmath15 meson is included in the lagrangian @xmath19    the meson masses are given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the nucleon mass is @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the coupling constants for the mesons and the photon .",
    "the field tensors for the vector mesons @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for the electromagnetic field , it is @xmath30 .",
    "recourse to variational principle followed by the mean field approximation treating the fields as @xmath31 numbers results in the dirac equation for the nucleon and the klein - gordon type equations for the mesons and the photon . for the static case , along with the time - reversal invariance and charge conservation ,",
    "the equations get simplified .",
    "the resulting equations , known as rmf equations , have the following form .",
    "the dirac equation for the nucleon is @xmath32 \\ }",

    "the chemical potential @xmath46 for protons ( neutrons ) is obtained from the requirement @xmath47 the sum is taken over proton ( neutron ) states .",
    "the gap parameter @xmath48 is obtained by minimising the free energy @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51,\\ ] ] with @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the pairing strength and the mass number respectively . the single - particle energies and the fields appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ ene ] ) - ( [ ecou ] ) are obtained from the self - consistent solution of eqs .",
    "( [ dir ] ) - ( [ pho ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependent occupancies of the fermions induce temperature dependence in the bosonic fields through the source terms as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ sig])-([pho ] ) .",
    "we generate these self - consistent solutions using the basis expansion method @xcite ; this yields the quadrupole deformation @xmath55 , the hexadecapole deformation @xmath56 and the proton and neutron pairing gaps @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a function of temperature .",
    "we have chosen even - even isotopes of the nuclei @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the study of the pairing and shape transitions .",
    "the nl3 parameter set is chosen for the values of the coupling constants and the masses of the mesons and the nucleons .",
    "this parameter set reproduces best the ground state as well as the compression properties of finite nuclei simultaneously @xcite ; however , it has already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the results for shape transition are not that sensitive to the choice of the parameter set .",
    "the pairing gaps @xmath59 and @xmath60 for neutrons and protons for a nucleus in the ground state are determined from the experimental odd - even mass differences @xcite .",
    "the single - particle states are calculated using spherical oscillator basis with twelve shells .",
    "the values of the chemical potential and the pairing gap at a given temperature are determined using all the single particle states upto @xmath61 ( the model space ) above the fermi surface without assuming any core .    at finite temperature , because of the partial occupancies of nucleons above the fermi surface , it is in principle necessary to have a larger basis and an extended model space .",
    "it is further necessary to take effects due to continuum into account @xcite . in order to check the convergence of the calculations , we have enlarged the basis space from twelve shells to twenty shells and",
    "have extended the model space to include single - particle states upto @xmath62 above the fermi surface .",
    "for this extended model space , the pairing strength @xmath53 is adjusted to reproduce the ground state pairing gap .",
    "the changes in the values of the observables are found to be insignificant due to this extension of the basis and model space even at the highest temperature of our interest ( @xmath63 mev ) . to estimate the importance of the continuum corrections on the observables we report here",
    ", we calculated the occupancy @xmath64 of the single particle states with positive energy . for @xmath65 mev , practically there is no particle in the positive energy states ( @xmath66 ) and at the highest temperature of interest studied here ( @xmath67 mev ) , @xmath68 which is very small .",
    "it is therefore expected that continuum corrections may not play an important role in the temperature range we study .",
    "calculations of nuclear level density in earlier studies @xcite , have shown that the continuum corrections are not important for @xmath69 upto @xmath70 mev .",
    "the continuum effects may grow stronger for @xmath71 mev , however , this is beyond the shape transition temperatures and so we have not taken this into account .",
    "the temperature evolution of the quadrupole deformation @xmath55 with neutron number @xmath72 and 88 for the systems @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are displayed in fig .",
    "it is well known that addition of nucleons beyond the closed shell gives nuclei progressive prolate deformation upto around the middle of the next shell closure .",
    "this is reflected in the figure for all the isotopes and isotones .",
    "it is also seen that the critical temperature increases with addition of nucleons for these systems . it is not immediately apparent whether there is a close correlation between the ground state deformation @xmath5 and the critical temperature @xmath4 for shape transition ; we come back to this issue later . in the top panel of this figure , particularly for @xmath73",
    ", it is seen that the deformation increases a little with temperature before finally falling to zero .",
    "this is due to the delicate balance between the temperature dependence of the pairing force and the nuclear interaction as derived from the rmf theory .",
    "the dramatic build - up of a deformation in a temperature window for this nucleus as seen earlier @xcite in the non - relativistic framework is absent in our calculations .    the temperature dependence of the pairing gaps @xmath57 and @xmath58 for protons and neutrons for the two isotopes each of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the pairing gaps decrease monotonically with temperature , vanishing at @xmath74 mev for neutrons and at @xmath75 mev for protons .",
    "the sudden collapse of the pairing gap and the nuclear deformation at some specified temperatures signifies phase transitions ; these correspond to transition from the superfluid nuclear phase to the normal phase and a transition from the deformed shape to the spherical shape , respectively .",
    "these transitions show up as bumps ( displayed in fig . 4 for @xmath73 and @xmath76 ) in the temperature evolution of the heat capacity defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the excitation energy of the nucleus in question .",
    "at a temperature @xmath79 mev , the twin peaks are seen for both the nuclei referring to the dissolution of the neutron and proton pairing gaps .",
    "these are the characteristic signatures of second order phase transition from the superfluid to the normal phase .",
    "a somewhat more prominent bump is seen at a temperature @xmath80 mev for @xmath73 ( upper panel ) .",
    "this corresponds to the nuclear shape transition .",
    "addition of two neutrons ( lower panel for @xmath76 ) shifts the shape transition temperature to @xmath81 mev .",
    "this is possibly due to the larger ground state deformation of the @xmath76 nucleus .    from the study of the hot @xmath73 and @xmath76 nuclei , it was conjectured",
    "earlier @xcite that addition of two neutrons might increase the critical temperature for deformation collapse . to test this conjecture in detail ,",
    "we have calculated the ground state quadrupole deformation and shape transition temperatures for a host of even - even @xmath10 isotopes .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "5 . in the vicinity of the closed shell ( @xmath82 ) ,",
    "the ground state quadrupole deformation @xmath5 increases fast with the addition of two neutrons as seen from the top panel of fig .",
    "5 . as the neutron number approaches the mid shell , the deformation levels off , and then ,",
    "as is well known , switches over to the oblate shape @xcite ( not shown in the figure ) . the critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) for the shape transition also increases with neutron pair addition as seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "5 . the functional behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath4 with neutron number @xmath83",
    "are found to be very similar .",
    "indeed there is a strong correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath4 as displayed in fig .",
    "the filled circles refer to the results from the present calculation ; they can be fairly well fitted with a straight line @xmath84 the fit is obtained using results from the twelve different isotopes of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath85 nuclei .",
    "the results calculated @xcite in the ( p+q ) model are also presented in the figure ( open squares ) for a comparison with those obtained from the rmf theory .",
    "the @xmath86 correlation is then also found to be approximately linear with a smaller slope .",
    "the shape transition temperatures obtained in the present calculations are somewhat higher compared to those obtained in the @xmath87 model ; one may be inclined to attribute this difference to the higher effective mass in the @xmath87 model .",
    "however , calculations with different sets of field parameters in the rmf theory with considerably different values of the effective masses yield conflicting results . we have done calculations for @xmath76 with the parameter sets hs and nl2 which yield very different @xmath88 @xcite ( 0.54 and 0.67 ) , but the @xmath4 comes out to be 1.45 and 1.75 mev , respectively , contrary to the simple - minded expectations .",
    "therefore no simple explanation for the higher values of @xmath4 in the rmf theory is obvious .    how does the pairing transition temperature @xmath89 depend on the pairing gap at @xmath90 ? intuitively one would expect the collapse of nuclear superfluidity at a larger temperature if the ground state pairing gap @xmath91 is larger . to study it quantitatively",
    ", we have done calculations for the different isotopes of @xmath10 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "7 . in its upper panel",
    ", we display the experimental neutron and proton ground state pairing gaps as a function of neutron number for the @xmath10 isotopes ; in the lower panel , the pairing transition temperatures @xmath89 are displayed .",
    "an extremely strong correlation between @xmath89 and @xmath91 for both neutrons and protons is seen ; this is manifest in the linear relationship @xmath92 for both neutrons and protons which is also shown in fig.8 .",
    "the points in the figure include , in addition to @xmath10 , results from @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath85 isotopes .",
    "the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath91 is in very close agreement to that obtained in the nonrelativistic ( p+q ) model @xcite .",
    "the hexadecapole deformation @xmath56 , if any , also collapses at the same shape transition temperature @xmath4 as the quadrupole deformation . in fig .",
    "9 , we plot the hexadecapole moment ( a measure of @xmath56 ) as a function of temperature for @xmath73 and @xmath76 .",
    "addition of neutrons gives larger ground state @xmath93 .",
    "the deformation increases smoothly at low temperature upto @xmath94 mev and then collapses to zero at @xmath4 .",
    "the initial enhancement of this deformation is related to the weakening of the pairing correlations with temperature .",
    "such an enhancement is also seen in a finite temperature hartree - fock bogoliubov ( fthfb ) calculation using the finite range density - dependent gogny force @xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean field theory has been applied to understand properties of some rare - earth even - even nuclei at finite temperature . pairing effects",
    "have been included through the bcs approximation .",
    "focus is made mainly on the temperature - induced transition from the nuclear superfluid phase to the normal phase and also on the shape transition from a deformed shape to a spherical one . to find out the systematics of the dependence of the pairing and shape transition temperatures on the values of the ground state pairing gap and the ground state deformation , we have done calculations for several isotopes of different rare - earth nuclei .",
    "we find that there is a linear correlation between the above mentioned transition temperatures and the equilibrium values of the pairing gap and deformation at zero temperature .",
    "the linear relationship is extremely good for the pairing gap and quite fair for the deformation . in the range of nuclei that are studied here",
    ", it is indeed possible to estimated very closely the value of the pairing transition temperature @xmath89 for both neutrons and protons , as the ground state pairing gap can be calculated from the systematics of binding energy .",
    "similarly , it appears that the shape transition temperatures can be well estimated since the ground state quadrupole deformations can be experimentally extracted .",
    "the transition temperatutres @xmath89 are not too different from those calculated earlier in a non - relativistic framework ; the shape transition temperatures @xmath4 however seem to be higher than the corresponding values calculated in the ( p+q ) model",
    ". these higher values of the shape transition temperatures are however found to be very compatible with the ones obtained from the realistic gogny force .",
