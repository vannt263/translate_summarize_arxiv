    "unbranched alkane chains ( c@xmath2h@xmath3 ) are of fundamental importance in organic chemistry .",
    "they are constituents of fossil fuels and polymers , as well as important structural motifs in lipids and other biomolecules .",
    "it is clearly important to understand their conformational and thermochemical properties .",
    "the conformer potential energy surface of an unbranched alkane is characterized by torsional twists which lead from linear chains to highly deformed structures dominated by intramolecular dispersion forces . at temperatures less than @xmath4 kelvin , short alkanes ( @xmath5 ) in the gas phase",
    "are well known to prefer the linear all - trans ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for trans , cross and gauche dihedral angles respectively ) conformation . however , as the length of the alkane grows there must be a point where the attractive intramolecular interactions will cause the chain to self - solvate into a folded conformer .",
    "a cross - gauche - cross rotation combination ( @xmath9 ) is sufficient to fold the chain,@xcite but this creates an energetically unfavorable _",
    "syn_-pentane like conformation .",
    "in addition , the chain ends are not parallel in this conformation , reducing the possible stabilization due to van der waals attraction .",
    "a hairpin conformation with four gauche rotations@xcite ( @xmath10 ) minimizes the number of strained bonds and allows an energetically favorable parallel arrangement of the chain ends , leading it to be the suggested global minimum for longer alkanes.@xcite these three conformational structures are illustrated in figure [ diagram ] .",
    "illustrative optimized alkane structures.,width=312 ]    it is well known that the computation of relative energies involving weak interactions presents a significant challenge for computational studies . in the case of short alkanes ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "standard dft methods are largely inadequate to describe the conformer energies and ordering of states@xcite while _ ab initio _ methods past second order perturbation theory are necessary for a full description of the more configurationally complicated transition state conformer structures.@xcite as the length of the alkane chain increases so does the importance of a proper treatment of dispersion.@xcite in the case of octane ( @xmath12 ) second order perturbation theory calculations underestimate the  bowl \" conformer ( @xmath13 ) energy difference while coupled cluster theory ( ccsd ) will overestimate the energy difference by @xmath14 kcal / mol compared to the  gold standard \" inclusion of perturbative triples obtained using ccsd(t ) .    with these computational difficulties in mind ,",
    "it is clear why the hairpin conformer critical chain length ( at which it becomes the global minimum ) is difficult to determine accurately .",
    "early work by goodman@xcite using force field and semi - empirical calculations suggested a turning point anywhere between @xmath15 to @xmath16 , with subsequent force field calculations@xcite also pointing towards @xmath17 as the critical chain length .",
    "this problem was experimentally addressed in the recent work of lttschwager _",
    "et al._@xcite their experiment used raman spectroscopy with a supersonic jet expansion apparatus and concluded that the critical chain length is between @xmath18 and @xmath17 at temperatures of 100k .",
    "the accompanying theoretical work uses a local coupled cluster approach to also suggest a critical chain length of @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we will first obtain benchmark _",
    "ab initio _ structures , electronic and harmonic vibrational energies for the linear ( all - trans ) and hairpin alkane conformers of increasing length starting with octane ( @xmath12 ) through tetradecane ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these benchmark values will be used to characterize various approximate methods that are extendable to longer chains ( @xmath20 ) with which we predict the critical alkane chain length .",
    "although they are not the focus of this study , entropic effects become important as the temperature increases , and this is discussed briefly in the conclusions .",
    "we perform _ ab initio _ and dft electronic structure calculations on the n - alkane ( @xmath21 ) linear and hairpin conformers using the gamess@xcite and aces iii@xcite quantum chemistry packages running on the university of florida hpc , hipergator and university of connecticut becat clusters . all calculations in this work use dunning s correlation consistent family of basis sets ( cc - pvnz , n = t , q).@xcite for resolution - of - the - identity calculations the triple - zeta fitting basis set of weigend _ et al._@xcite ( cc - pvtz - ri ) are used in conjunction with the standard cc - pvtz basis set . unless explicitly stated all correlation calculations in this work assume the frozen - core approximation where all @xmath22 carbon orbitals are dropped from the correlation space while the corresponding last virtual orbital is retained .    for shorter ( @xmath23 ) alkane chains",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the quality of the final optimized geometry is more strongly dependent on the level of the correlation theory than on the basis set .",
    "additional tests show that including correlation beyond that of second order mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) is unnecessary . for the longer alkane species we find that the use of a small basis set ( such as the pople split valence 6 - 311 g * basis set ) that has insufficient polarization functions will lead to erroneous hairpin structures",
    ". therefore geometry optimizations of the alkane conformers used in this work are obtained using the mp2 level of theory ( with analytic gradients ) and the cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "harmonic zero point energy ( zpe ) shifts are computed numerically using analytic first derivatives at the mp2/cc - pvtz all - electron level of theory . due to the cost of numerical mp2 hessians ,",
    "the massively parallel aces iii program is used to perform the necessary first derivatives with the caveat that only all - electron mp2 gradients are available .",
    "this change of theory between geometries and hessian is found to introduce a negligible error of @xmath24 kcal / mol when considering relative conformer zpe shifts .    high level single point energy calculations are computed using coupled cluster theory with singles , doubles , and perturbative triples@xcite ( ccsd(t ) ) and the cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "higher order effects such as contributions from the core - valence correlation energy or higher order excitations ( full triples , quadruples etc . )",
    "are not included as their effects are small and cancel nearly identically in conformational energy differences .",
    "it is convenient to analyze the calculated energies by orders of perturbation theory . in this way the mp2 correlation energy is given by @xmath25 , while higher order contributions can be conveniently given as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "because the basis set convergence of the post - mp2 correlation is much faster than the second order contribution@xcite , we can estimate the effects of going to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit by combining large basis mp2 energies and small basis coupled cluster correlation energies . using the cc - pvtz and cc - pvqz basis sets , we separately extrapolate the scf and mp2 correlation energy using the linear extrapolation formulas of schwenke@xcite @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) and helgaker _",
    "et al._@xcite @xmath31 respectively . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 refers to the scf and mp2 correlation energy computed with the cc - pvnz basis set .",
    "adding in the coupled cluster correlation energy to form a composite cbs energy @xmath34 we obtain a @xmath35 kcal / mol shift compared to the ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz relative energy for the @xmath36 alkanes ( see table [ benche ] ) .",
    "as the cost of doing an mp2/cc - pvqz calculation for the alkane chains longer than @xmath19 starts to become prohibitively expensive ( over 1800 basis functions and 130 electrons ) we instead omit the cbs correction and include a @xmath37 kcal / mol error estimate in our final result .",
    ".[benche]benchmark _ ab initio _ conformer energy differences ( hairpin @xmath38 linear , in kcal / mol ) for the @xmath36 alkane chains .",
    "harmonic zpe energies were computed at the mp2/cc - pvtz level of theory . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     density functional theory is not typically a good choice for non - covalently bonded and weakly interacting conformer studies ( or any system where dispersion is an important consideration ) .",
    "however with the inclusion of london type dispersion@xcite through an empirically derived additive correction ( in this case using grimme s",
    "-d3 function@xcite ) dft methods can be quantitative@xcite within the limits of the training set . in our previous work@xcite the accuracy of the b2-plyp@xcite ,",
    "b2gp - plyp@xcite and dsd - blyp@xcite double - hybrid dft composite functionals using the dual - basis@xcite resolution - of - the - identity@xcite approximation ( see the previous methods section ) were tested for a variety of non - covalently bonded dimers and small alkane conformers ( so called s22@xcite and aconf@xcite test set ) .",
    "the results of which were promising , with an average rms error of @xmath39 kcal / mol for the s22 set and @xmath40 kcal / mol for the @xmath41 alkanes .",
    "using these dh - dft / db - ri - mp2 composite methods , we return to the hairpin preference problem at hand and compute relative conformer energies for all the long alkanes ( @xmath42 ) and compare the resulting values to our ccsd fno(t ) values in table [ totalse ] . as can be seen in figure [ approximate ] the dh - dft / db - ri - mp2 conformer energies track the higher level _ ab initio _ results very well , the best curve coming from the dsd - blyp functional with a nearly constant @xmath40 kcal / mol error . with a computational cost many orders less than the predictive ccsd fno(t ) composite method considered here , these dh - dft / db - ri - mp2 composite methods continue to be a promising approximate method in cases too computationally difficult for coupled cluster calculations .",
    "composite relative single point energies , @xmath43 , compared against benchmark ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz values.,width=311 ]",
    "as the length of unbranched alkane chains reaches some critical length , intramolecular dispersion forces cause a self - solvation effect in which the chains assume a folded conformation .",
    "to accurately determine this critical chain length , linear and hairpin alkane conformer structures were optimized using the mp2/cc - pvtz level of theory for chains of length up through @xmath17 .",
    "benchmark ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz single point energy calculations were then performed for octane through tetradecane using the aces iii@xcite massively parallel quantum chemistry package .",
    "harmonic zero point energies and temperature shifts were computed using the mp2/cc - pvtz level of theory .    for chains longer than @xmath19",
    "it was necessary to use more approximate methods to obtain conformer energy differences .",
    "it was found that our ccsd fno(t ) method which takes the full ccsd correlation energy and adds the perturbative triples correlation energy taken from a frozen natural orbital calculation where retaining only 60% of the virtual space is required to obtain results comparable to full ccsd(t ) results ( table [ fnoe ] ) .",
    "we have also explored the effectiveness of the dual - basis resolution - of - the - identity double - hybrid density functional theory approach to this problem . with a computational cost several orders of magnitude less than the more rigorous _",
    "ab initio _ methods considered here we find that these approximate dft methods performed well with errors @xmath44 kcal / mol .    computing the conformer temperature enthalpy differences using the ccsd fno(t ) electronic energies and approximate mp2/cc - pvtz zpe shift for alkane chains up through @xmath17 show that the temperature dependent hairpin preference takes place at @xmath45 , with a confidence of @xmath46 kcal / mol .",
    "this finding is in complete agreement with the experimental results of lttschwagger _",
    "et al._@xcite    as the temperature increases , entropic effects will become important .",
    "the gibbs free energy difference between linear and folded chains will tend to decrease due to the increased entropy of the folded conformation .",
    "an accurate assessment of this effect would require conformational sampling of the ccsd(t ) energy surface , a calculation that greatly exceeds the computational resources available to us . however , the close agreement of our calculated results with the low temperature results of lttschwagger _",
    "et al._@xcite suggests that our conclusions would be significantly altered by entropic effects only at much higher temperatures .",
