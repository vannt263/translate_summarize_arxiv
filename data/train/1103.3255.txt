    ": every diffeomorphism @xmath8 has a hyperbolic set @xmath9 ( depending continuously on @xmath0 ) whose stable and unstable manifolds have non - transverse intersections , see @xcite .",
    "later , in @xcite , newhouse proved that homoclinic tangencies of surface diffeomorphisms can be _ stabilized _ : given a diffeomorphism @xmath0 with a homoclinic tangency associated to a saddle @xmath10 , there is a @xmath6-open set whose closure contains @xmath0 and which consists of diffeomorphisms @xmath11 with robust homoclinic tangencies associated to hyperbolic sets @xmath12 containing the continuation @xmath13 of @xmath10 . in particular , these results show that homoclinic tangencies always generate @xmath6-robust homoclinic tangencies .",
    "in fact , robust homoclinic tangencies are present in all known examples of open sets of non - hyperbolic surface diffeomorphisms .",
    "let us observe that homoclinic tangencies of @xmath14-diffeomorphisms defined on surfaces can not be stabilized , see @xcite .",
    "similarly , all known examples of @xmath14-open sets formed by non - hyperbolic diffeomorphisms exhibit @xmath14-robust _ heterodimensional cycles , _ that is , cycles relating the invariant manifolds of two hyperbolic sets of different @xmath15-indices ( dimension of the stable bundle ) . note that the existence of such cycles can only occur in dimension @xmath16 .",
    "we wonder if , as in the case of homoclinic tangencies of @xmath6-diffeomorphisms , heterodimensional cycles can be made @xmath14-robust and can be @xmath14-stabilized . a first partial answer to this question",
    "is given in @xcite : heterodimensional cycles associated to periodic saddles whose indices differ by one generate ( by arbitrarily small @xmath14-perturbations ) @xmath14-robust heterodimensional cycles . in some extend ,",
    "the results in @xcite are a version of the ones by newhouse in @xcite in the context of @xmath14-heterodimensional cycles .",
    "however , compared with newhouse s results for homoclinic tangencies , the ones in @xcite have an important disadvantage : while the hyperbolic sets with the robust homoclinic tangencies in @xcite contain continuation of the saddle with the initial tangency , the hyperbolic sets involved in robust cycles in @xcite do in general not contain the continuations of the saddles in the initial cycle .",
    "however this precise question can be important for understanding the global dynamics of non - hyperbolic diffeomorphisms .",
    "let us discuss more this question in more detail .",
    "following conley theory @xcite and motivated by spectral decomposition theorems @xcite , this global dynamics is structured using _",
    "homoclinic _ or / and _ chain recurrence classes _ as  elementary \" pieces of dynamics , see the definitions below . one aims to describe the dynamics of each piece and the relations between different pieces ( cycles ) , for further details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10.3 - 4 ) and @xcite .",
    "in general , the homoclinic class of a hyperbolic periodic point is contained in its chain recurrence class .",
    "an important property is that for @xmath14-generic diffeomorphisms homoclinic classes and chain recurrence classes of periodic points coincide , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remarque 1.10 )",
    ". however , in non - generic situations , two different homoclinic classes ( even of saddles of different indices ) may be joined by a cycle , hence they are contained in the same chain recurrence class .",
    "a question is when one can join them in a @xmath14-robust way by small perturbations .",
    "this occurs if the cycle can be stabilized .",
    "for instance , this is specially important for understanding the indices of the periodic points in an elementary piece of dynamics .",
    "while the above explains why the stabilization of cycles is relevant , let us now provide the precise definitions of the concepts involved .",
