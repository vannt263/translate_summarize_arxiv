    "convection is of primordial importance with many applications from astrophysics to nanophysics , i.e. on the large scale @xcite and on the small scale @xcite . here , we present a two - dimensional analogue to the widely studied three - dimensional rayleigh - bnard convection cells : a vertically free - standing thin liquid film spanning across a metal frame is heated from below and cooled from above .",
    "the advantage of a two - dimensional setup is that the geometry can be varied with relative ease and the cost of construction and operation is far less compared to three - dimensional setups .",
    "however , these advantages are traded in for more complicated boundary conditions .",
    "our focus lies on the investigation of rayleigh - bnard convection , one paradigmatic system in hydrodynamics .",
    "it consists of fluid confined between a heat source with gravity acting parallel to the temperature gradient .",
    "it is widely used to study pattern formation and transitions between laminar and turbulent flow . in the last years",
    ", the question of reversals in rayleigh - bnard convection has been studied numerically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the setup is designed flexible in order to vary geometry and inflow boundary conditions , in particular the change of the flow characteristics with aspect ratio @xmath2 ( horizontal versus vertical dimension ) and with temperature difference .",
    "thereby , we cover fundamental and applied aspects , extending thin film experimental techniques to a very important non - equilibrium situation .",
    "first steps towards experiments with stationary films and thermal driving have been reported , but the chemical composition and evaporation from the film have neither been controlled nor monitored @xcite .",
    "one reason might be the relatively naive choice of chemicals ( commercial detergents ) which contain an ensemble of unknown surfactants and may contain anti - foaming agents which limit film stability .",
    "in contrast , many experiments with extremely well controlled chemistry and environment have been done on static thin films with a focus on the detailed understanding of interfacial physics , including surfactants and the chemical details of the liquid , @xcite .",
    "the presented measurement setup was designed with a precise control of the solution composition and ambient parameters in mind .",
    "as evaporation from the thin film , especially in heat driven convection scenarios can dramatically change the surface properties of a thin liquid film , a well - controlled experiment is needed .",
    "it is possible to stably observe convection patterns for film thicknesses of , over a long time .",
    "consequently , the developed apparatus serves as a two - dimensional , well - controlled experiment using _ stable , free - standing _ thin liquid films to study two - dimensional rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "typical rayleigh numbers of are reached with a centimeter size experiment .",
    "open questions concern the change of fluid properties with thickness , and the detailed influence of additional chemical forces ( e.g. from surfactants ) , in comparison to classical fluid dynamics .",
    "thin film dynamics is governed by _",
    ", _ capillary _ and _ interfacial _ forces .",
    "the drainage of thin films induced by the capillary pressure @xmath3 is countered by interactions between the film surfaces .",
    "these interactions are combined in the disjoining pressure @xmath4 which acts acts perpendicular to the interfaces , thus balancing @xmath3 .",
    "a quasistatic equilibrium is established when @xmath5 .",
    "the relevant interactions constituting @xmath4 are electrostatic , van der waals ( vdw ) , and steric forces @xcite and strongly depend on the distance between the interacting surfaces .    whereas films on substrates are established in industry and research @xcite , freestanding thin liquid films ( hereafter tlfs ) still provide a challenge in experiments and theory alike .",
    "consequently , the study of tlfs is central to many current scientific activities , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we contribute by presenting a novel experimental setup to analyze convection in _ vertically oriented , freestanding , thermally forced , non - equilibrium _ tlfs .    as a result of the force balance ,",
    "two stable equilibria may occur , depending on the chemical composition of bulk solution and chosen surface active agents ( surfactants ) : common black films ( cbf ) with a thickness of more than are formed when electrostatic interactions balance the dominant van der waals force , and , of course , gravity and capillarity @xcite ; newton black films ( nbf ) are stable with a thickness of less than , due to repulsive short range steric forces @xcite . depending on the chemical composition of the liquid",
    "the film will reach a nbf or cbf @xcite . in order to distinguish these cases",
    "it is essential to have well controlled experimental conditions : filtered , deionized water , pure surfactants and control over the ambient parameters ( temperature and humidity ) .    for the non - equilibrium dynamical behaviour ,",
    "studies have so far focused on the role of gravitational or capillary forces in undisturbed , freestanding tlfs @xcite .",
    "the effect of additional forces has been studied by a few authors , mostly for micrometer - thick systems @xcite .",
    "the formation of tlfs , aided by thermal forcing is an open issue on the nanoscale . for the most part of the presented convection experiments the tlf will be in a quasi - steady but transient state .",
    "the convection prevents stratification , therefore the tlf does not reach its equilibrium thickness ( cbf or nbf ) : the slow , gravity driven thinning is counteracted and a more uniform thickness is maintained . in this quasi - steady state convection is vigorous and can last indefinitely without the formation of an equilibrium phase layer .",
    "additionally , the convection can be triggered after the tlf has reached its equilibrium nbf state so that forced convection in a sub tlf can be observed . to our knowledge",
    "our setup is the first to make this observation possible . as the cbf or nbf show almost no reflection of ( visible ) light due to the particular interference conditions ( the film can be much thinner than visible light ) , data acquisition and analysis",
    "is challenging .",
    "the driving mechanism in this setup is a temperature gradient antiparallel to gravity which results in a buoyancy - driven convection , analogue to classic rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "please note that no marangoni type flows are present in this setup ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the tlf is bound by the frame , such that no conventional marangoni effect occurs , since there is no free interface and consequently no thermocapillary effect occurs .",
    "however , there is an interface with the holding frame , subject to no - slip boundary conditions , which hinders any tangential flow .",
    "more heuristically , a marangoni effect would drive a flow orthogonal to the vertically oriented surface .",
    "we , however observe a flow in the plane of the film , i.e. , transversal to the surface .",
    "additionally , the surface is mobile and therefore no surfactant concentration gradients arise which could lead to a marangoni flow @xcite .",
    "no surface stresses can arise and the surface tension is constant@xcite at @xmath7 .",
    "one of the long - standing , very important questions in convection problems concerns the understanding of the convective - to - conductive heat transport , measured by the nusselt number , @xmath8 , and of the momentum transport , characterized by the reynolds number , @xmath9 , where @xmath2 denotes the aspect ratio of the container .",
    "the scaling of nu(ra ) , re(ra ) has been studied , mainly in water and air , few for liquid metals .",
    "the corresponding range of prandtl numbers is relatively limited .",
    "experimental studies on the aspect ratio , @xmath2 , exist , are however cost intensive , e.g. for the  barrel of ilmenau ",
    "@xcite , where a variation of @xmath10 is possible by controlling the cool top of a cylindrical vessel @xcite .",
    "under certain conditions , a flow develops a large - scale circulation ( lsc ) .",
    "it is observed experimentally and numerically in 3d and 2d that this lsc breaks down and/or reverts in a regular or irregular way , depending on @xmath11 and geometry @xcite .",
    "recent 2d numerical studies of lohse et al .",
    "indicate that the dynamics of reversals strongly depends on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to 3d convection experiments , there is relatively little done _ experimentally _ on 2d , or quasi-2d systems .",
    "initial convection studies of foam films were carried out by mysels @xcite , later by couder @xcite .",
    "a theoretical framework was established by chomaz @xcite and bruinsma @xcite .",
    "typically , free - standing tlfs are employed as fluid systems , where a collapse of the film is prevented by repumping liquid in order to compensate for losses due to evaporation , and of course gravitational flow downwards @xcite .",
    "this results in relatively uncontrolled boundary conditions , since the free surface can vary in thickness and can even develop instabilities ( ripples , etc . ) .",
    "however , the system is well suited for experiments on 2d turbulence , because for reynolds numbers up to at least the thickness is well below the kolmogorov length , which marks the scale above which no turbulence occurs , and dissipation dominates the momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "in 2d , the momentum is transferred from small to large scales by the so - called `` inverse cascade '' in contrast to 3d , where the opposite is observed as the `` direct cascade '' @xcite . in extremely large tlfs ( with heights of several meters ) information about the inverse cascade is observed experimentally by particle imaging and laser doppler velocimetry .",
    "a well explored topic is the evolution of grid turbulence with seeded sub - micron particles @xcite .",
    "for a two  dimensional tlf , one can assume an effective decoupling of buoyancy - caused advection and surface - related relaxation due to disjoining and capillary pressure .",
    "of course , in a complete , 3d description basically all forces are coupled .",
    "for very small length scales , a molecular description is necessary , however the hydrodynamic approximation holds well down to a few molecular layers .",
    "these issues and further details can be read in @xcite , where , however , mainly fluid confined by solid walls are considered .",
    "more fundamental discussion is given in @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the scales considered here ( ) are sufficiently described by hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this assumption is not completely unreasonable as @xmath12 and thus other forces are smaller by orders of magnitude .",

    "is angled downwards with respect to the tlf - plane to prevent reflection from the light source off the front glass into the camera to enhance imaging contrast .",

    "additionally , there is a u - shaped reservoir in the container with two resistive heating elements built in .",
    "this reservoir is filled with deionized water and used to regulate the humidity inside the chamber via an automated control loop using a humidity sensor .",
    "the frame assembly ( 3 ) fits into the film solution reservoir ( 2 ) in which it can be submerged and pulled out by an automated motorized control .",
    "the top enclosure of the setup ( 4 ) sits on top of the bottom reservoir and shields the thin liquid film thus allowing for a precisely controlled atmosphere ( temperature and humidity ) inside the measurement cell .",
    "+    the dimensions of the measurement cell are based on the frame ( 3 ) dimensions ( width  height  depth ) .",
    "therefore the outer dimensions of the complete measurement cell are ( width  height  depth ) .",
    "furthermore , the cell is modular to allow for easier cleaning as tlfs are very susceptible to contamination and dust particles .",

    "the speed of this process determines the initial thickness of the thin liquid film .",
    "the film then forms a wedge - like profile due to gravity .",
    "after the initial draining phase of excess fluid the gravitationally driven thinning process is orders of magnitude slower than the fluid transport by heat convection . essentially , this enables us to keep the amount of liquid inside the frame constant as the liquid is transported as no drainage over the bottom meniscus occurs .",
    "any loss in fluid volume can be attributed to the evaporation at the bottom heating element due to the lower concentration of water in the air .",

    "exist two temperature control schemes in research and industry : either the devices is connected to a large thermal mass whose temperature is regulated by a flow - through cooler or a heat pump in form of a thermoelectric cooler ( tec ) is employed .",
    "the type of device implemented depends on the scale of the setup , the expected temperature variation and the desired speed of temperature changes ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the dimensions of our setup are relatively small and the thermal mass of the frame elements is low which favours a temperature control setup based on tec units which operate on a high update frequency to insure optimal temperature balance .",
    "additionally , this enables us to quickly change the temperature with a controlled ramp up .",
    "the tec - arrays in the top and bottom frame unit are connected to a control unit which adjusts the amount of current flowing through the array to achieve a precisely controlled temperature .",

    "the pid control loop for top and bottom temperature and humidity are realized in labview together with the motor control for the automated frame submersion into the solution reservoir .",
    "the necessary wires and tubing for the water cooling loop exit the measurement chamber through holes in the side walls .",
    "temperature gradients up to @xmath19 are possible .",
    "the maximum temperature difference is limited by decreased film stability at high temperatures and increased condensation at the top border of the frame at temperatures close to the freezing point of the solution .",

    "the interference of incident and reflected light yields a striped pattern , which can be used to infer the film thickness .",
    "each color cycle corresponds to the multiples @xmath29 of the smallest negative interference condition @xmath30 , where the refraction index , @xmath31 , is assumed to be temperature - independent ; @xmath32 is the angle of incidence @xcite .",
    "the film is illuminated through this viewing window by an array of high power white leds which are placed behind a diffuser . additionally , to avoid direct reflections of the light source from the viewing window ,",
    "the front observation window is tilted downwards with respect to the liquid film plane .    the diffused light is reflected by the front and back side of the film whereas the front reflection is shifted by @xmath33 due to reflecting of an optically thicker medium .",
    "if the film thickness is much smaller than @xmath34 of the smallest emitted wavelength the light waves interfere @xmath33 out - of - phase and no light is reflected .",
    "hence the name black film although more precisely it is transparent .",
    "the reason why there is no smooth transition in the intensity of the reflected light is the abrupt change in thickness when the black film is formed . at @xmath34 of the smallest wavelength , which is blue ( @xmath35 ) in the case of the used white leds ,",
    "the reflected waves interfere constructively .",
    "in addition , every other wavelength is reflected as well which sums up to a white color with a blue tint . before that thickness",

    "in contrast to a stratified system the turbulence in our system is vigorous enough to break the stratification and involve the whole thin film in the convective motion .",
    "this enables a more homogeneous thickness throughout the film which makes it possible to retain temperature information without differing thermal emissivity due to large variations in thickness .",
    "as the ir - window is built into the back of the measurement chamber one can simultaneously observe the thin liquid film optically via the front window .",
