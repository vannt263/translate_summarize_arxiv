    "rare b meson decays are one of the most promising research area in particle physics and lie on the focus of theoretical and experimental physicists . in the standard model ( sm ) , they are induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at loop level and therefore sensitive to the gauge structure of the theory . from the experimental point of view , they play an outstanding role in the precise determination of the fundamental parameters of the sm , such as cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants , etc . furthermore , these decays provide a sensitive test to the new physics beyond the sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc . among the rare b decays ,",
    "@xmath0 has received considerable interest since the branching ratios ( br ) of the inclusive @xmath5 @xcite and exclusive @xmath6 @xcite have been already measured experimentally .",
    "recently , the new experimental results for the inclusive @xmath0 decay are announced by cleo and aleph collaborations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 decay is under an extensive investigation in the framework of various extensions of the sm , in order to get information about the model parameters or improve the existing restrictions .",
    "it is well known that the fcnc are forbidden at the tree level in the sm .",
    "this restriction is achieved in the extended model with the additional conditions .",
    "2hdm is one of the simplest extensions of the sm , obtained by the addition of a new scalar @xmath7 doublet .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian causes that the model possesses phenemologicaly dangerous fcnc s at the tree level . to protect the model from such terms ,",
    "the ad hoc discrete symmetry @xcite on the 2hdm scalar potential and the yukawa interaction is proposed and there appear two different versions of the 2hdm depending on whether up and down quarks couple to the same or different scalar doublets . in model i ,",
    "the up and down quarks get mass via vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . ) of only one higgs field . in model ii , which coincides with the mssm in the higgs sector , the up and down quarks get mass via v.e.v . of the higgs fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively where @xmath10 corresponds to first ( second ) higgs doublet of 2hdm @xcite . in the absence of the mentioned discrete symmetry",
    ", fcnc appears at the tree level and this model is called as model iii in current literature @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive phenemological analysis of the model iii was done in series of works @xcite . in particular , from a purely phenomenological point of view , low energy experiments involving @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc , place strong constraints on the existence of tree level flavor changing ( fc ) transitions , existing in the model iii .    in the present work ,",
    "we examine the @xmath0 decay in the model iii , taking the next to leading ( nlo ) qcd corrections into account , in a more detailed analysis compared to one existing in literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further , we obtain the constraints for the neutral couplings @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the assumption that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the other couplings which include the first generation indices are negligible compared to former ones ( for the definition of @xmath20 see section 2 ) .",
    "our predictions are based on the cleo measurement @xmath21 and the restrictions coming from the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) mixing and the @xmath4 parameter @xcite .",
    "note that nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath0 decay in 2hdm ( for model i and ii ) were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the nlo qcd corrected hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath0 decay in the model iii and discuss the effects of the additional @xmath22 flipped operators to the decay rate .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the constraint analysis , more precisely to the the ratios @xmath23 , @xmath24 and our conclusions .",
    "before presenting the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath25 decay amplitude in the 2hdm ( model iii ) , we would like to remind briefly the main features of the 2hdm .",
    "the yukawa interaction for the general case is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote chiral projections @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , are the two scalar doublets , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the matrices of the yukawa couplings . for convenience",
    "we choose @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the following basis : @xmath36\\ , ;   \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c }   \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\",
    ", , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vacuum expectation values are , @xmath37 this choice permits us to write the fc part of the interaction as @xmath38 with the following advantages :    * doublet @xmath39 corresponds to the scalar doublet of the sm and @xmath40 to the sm higgs field .",
    "this part of the yukawa lagrangian is responsible for the generation of the fermion masses with the couplings @xmath41 . *",
    "all new scalar fields belong to the @xmath42 scalar doublet .",
    "the couplings @xmath43 are the open window for the tree level fcnc s and can be expressed for the fc charged interactions as @xmath44 where @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "] is defined by the expression @xmath47 here the charged couplings appear as a linear combinations of neutral couplings multiplied by @xmath48 matrix elements .",
    "this gives an important distinction between model iii and model ii ( i ) .",
    "after this preliminary remark , let us discuss the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath0 decay in the 2hdm for the general case .",
    "the appropriate framework is that of an effective theory obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom , which are , in this context , @xmath49 quark , @xmath50 , and @xmath9 bosons , where @xmath51 denote charged , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the llog qcd corrections are done through matching the full theory with the effective low energy theory at the high scale @xmath52 and evaluating the wilson coefficients from @xmath53 down to the lower scale @xmath54 .",
    "note that we choose the higher scale as @xmath52 since the evaluation from the scale @xmath55 to @xmath52 gives negligible contribution to the wilson coefficients . here",
    "we assume that the charged higgs boson is heavy due to theoretical analysis of the @xmath0 decay ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian relevant for @xmath56 decay is @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are operators given in eq .",
    "( [ o7 ] ) and the @xmath59 are wilson coefficients renormalized at the scale @xmath60 . the coefficients are calculated perturbatively and expressed as functions of the heavy particle masses in the theory .",
    "the operator basis depends on the model used and the conventional choice in the case of sm , 2hdm model ii ( i ) and mssm is @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are @xmath64 colour indices and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the field strength tensors of the electromagnetic and strong interactions , respectively .    in our case , however , new operators with different chirality structures can arise since the general yukawa lagrangian includes both @xmath27 and @xmath28 chiral interactions .",
    "the conventional operator set is extended first adding two new operators which are left - right analogues of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , namely @xmath69 further we need the second operator set @xmath70 which are flipped chirality partners of @xmath71 : @xmath72 this extended basis is the same as the basis for @xmath73 extensions of sm @xcite .",
    "note that in the sm , model ii ( i ) 2hdm and the mssm , the absence of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are a consequence of assumption @xmath76 .    in the calculations ,",
    "we take only the charged higgs contributions into account and neglect the effects of neutral higgs bosons for the reasons given below : the neutral bosons @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are defined in terms of the mass eigenstates @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 where @xmath62 is the mixing angle and @xmath84 is proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the doublet @xmath34 ( eq . ( [ choice2 ] ) ) .",
    "here we assume that the massess of neutral higgs bosons @xmath81 and @xmath82 are heavy compared to the b - quark mass .",
    "the neutral higgs scalar @xmath81 and pseduscalar @xmath82 give contribution only to @xmath85 for @xmath0 decay . with the choice of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "can be expressed at @xmath89 level as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the masses and charges of the down quarks ( @xmath93 ) respectively .",
    "here we used the redefinition @xmath94 eq .",
    "( [ c7a0h0 ] ) shows that neutral higgs bosons can give a large contribution to @xmath85 , which does not respect the cleo and aleph data @xcite . at this stage",
    "we make an assumption that the couplings @xmath95(@xmath96 and @xmath97 are negligible to be able to reach the conditions @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these choices permit us to neglect the neutral higgs effects .",
    "now , for the evaluation of wilson coefficients , we need their initial values with standard matching computations . denoting the wilson coefficients for the additional charged higgs contribution with @xmath100",
    ", we have the initial values of the wilson coefficients for the first set of operators ( eqs.([o7 ] ) , ( [ newop1 ] ) ) @xmath101 the explicit forms of the wilson coefficients in the sm ( @xmath102 ) is presented in the literature @xcite . for the primed wison coefficients we get , @xmath103    @xmath104    where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the functions @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given as @xmath111 in calculations we neglect the small contributions of the internal @xmath112 and @xmath113 quarks compared to one due to the internal @xmath49 quark .",
    "for the initial values of the mentioned wilson coefficients in the model iii ( eqs .",
    "( [ coeffh ] ) , ( [ coeffsm2 ] ) and ( [ coeffh2 ] ) ) , we have @xmath114 using these initial values , we can calculate the coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath116 at any lower scale with five quark effective theory where large logarithims can be summed using the renormalization group . since the strong interactions preserve chirality , the operators in eqs .",
    "( [ o7 ] , [ newop1 ] ) can not mix with their chirality flipped counterparts eq .",
    "( [ newop2 ] ) and the anomalous dimension matrices of two separate set of operators are the same and do not overlap . with the above choosen",
    "initial values of wilson coefficients , their evaluations are similar to the sm case .    for completeness , note that , the operators @xmath117,@xmath118,@xmath119 and @xmath120 ( @xmath121,@xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) give contributions to the matrix element of @xmath0 and in the ndr scheme which we use here , the effective magnetic moment type wilson coefficients are redefined as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the color factor and @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) is the charge of up ( down ) quarks .",
    "there is still another mixing in the operator set @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) @xcite and we do not take into account since the initial values of the wilson coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath132 are zero in our case .",
    "the nlo corrected coefficients @xmath133 and @xmath134 are given as @xmath135 here @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the numbers which appear during the evaluation @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath139 @xcite and @xmath140)are the leading order qcd corrected wilson coefficients : @xmath141 and @xmath142 is the @xmath143 correction to the leading order result that its explicit form can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath144 can be obtained by replacing the wilson coefficients in @xmath142 with their primed counterparts .",
    "the nlo corrected coefficients @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath148 are numerically small at @xmath149 scale therefore we neglect them in our calculations .    finally , the nlo qcd corrected @xmath0 decay rate in model iii is obtained as @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath149 is b - quark mass .",
    "@xmath152 is given in @xcite @xmath153 the functions @xmath154 and a are @xcite @xmath155 the explicite expressions for @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 can be found in @xcite . at this point",
    "we would like to note that the expressions for unprimed wilson coefficients in our case can be obtained from the results in @xcite by the following replacements : @xmath160    to obtain @xmath161 , it is enough to use the primed wilson coefficients at @xmath89 level + ( eq . [ coeffh2 ] ) since the evaluation of @xmath162 from @xmath163 to @xmath164 is the same as that of @xmath165 .",
    "note that , for model ii ( model i ) @xmath166 and @xmath167 are @xmath168",
    "now let us turn our attention to the constraint analysis .",
    "restrictions to the free parameters , namely , the masses of the charged and neutral higgs bosons and the ratio of the v.e.v . of the two higgs fields , denoted by @xmath169 in the framework of model i and ii , have been predicted in series of works @xcite .",
    "recently the constraint which connects masses of the charged higgs bosons , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , is obtained by using the qcd corrected values in the llo approximation and it is shown that the constraint region is sensitive to the renormalization scale , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "usually , the stronger restrictions to the new couplings are obtained from the analysis of the @xmath2 ( here @xmath172 ) decays , the @xmath4 parameter and the @xmath21 decay . in @xcite , all these processes have been analysed and two possible scenarios are obtained depending on the choice whether the constraint from @xmath173 is enforced or not .",
    "although the new experimental results are near the sm result , @xmath174 , the world average value for @xmath175 is still almost one standard deviations higher than the sm one .",
    "this brings the possibility that an enhancement to the sm value is still necessary to get the correct experimental one .",
    "such an enhancement is reached under the conditions @xmath176 and @xmath177 @xcite , where @xmath178 is a model iii parameter ( see section 2 ) and @xmath84 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field responsible for the generation of fermion masses .",
    "first , the constraints for the fc couplings from @xmath2 processes for the model iii were investigated withouth qcd corrections , under the following assumptions @xcite @xmath179 where @xmath180 is up ( down ) quark and @xmath181 are the generation numbers .      using the constraint coming from @xmath184 , the measurement @xmath185 , @xmath2 mixing and the result coming from the analysis of the @xmath4 parameter ,",
    "the following restrictions are obtained @xcite : @xmath186 since the experimental results for @xmath173 are still unclear , we disregard the constraint coming from @xmath173 and we analyse the restrictions for the couplings @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 in the nlo aproximation , respecting the constraints due to the @xmath2 mixing , the @xmath4 parameter and using the measurement by the cleo @xcite collaboration : @xmath190 here , we explain why we use only the cleo data in our analysis but not aleph one ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the aleph data has a larger error compared to cleo data and it leads to a wide restriction region for @xmath192 , which includes the one coming from the cleo data .",
    "therefore , the cleo data allows us to get more stringest constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the idea in this calculation is to take @xmath193 and @xmath194 , where the indices @xmath181 denote @xmath195 and @xmath196 quarks .",
    "this choice permit us to neglect the neutral higgs contributions because the yukawa vertices are the combinations of @xmath197 and @xmath198 .    to reduce the b - quark mass dependence let us consider the ratio @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the phase space factor in semileptonic b - decay , @xmath201 is the qcd correction to the semileptonic decay width @xcite , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .      in fig .",
    "( [ tb45 ] ) , we plot the parameter @xmath205 with respect to @xmath206 at @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "we see , that there are two different restriction regions , where the upper one corresponds to the positive @xmath209 value , however the lower one to the negative @xmath209 value .",
    "increasing @xmath206 causes @xmath210 to decrease in both regions . with the given value of @xmath211 , the condition @xmath212 is obtained . in the lower region",
    "it is possible that the ratio becomes negative , i.e. @xmath213 .",
    "further , increasing @xmath170 causes to increase @xmath214 and the area of the restriction region .",
    "( [ tb45b ] ) is devoted the same dependence as in fig .",
    "( [ tb45 ] ) and shows that the third region , which is almost a straight line , appears . in this region",
    "the ratio @xmath215 and increases with increasing @xmath170 similar to the previous regions .",
    "finally , we consider @xmath205 dependence of @xmath216 , which is a neutral fc coupling . in fig .",
    "( [ cttt564 ] ) we plot the @xmath205 dependence of @xmath216 for fixed @xmath217 , at @xmath218 , and charged higgs mass @xmath208 . here the selected region for @xmath205 is @xmath219 . increasing @xmath205 forces the ratio @xmath220 to be negative .",
    "it is realized that the ratio @xmath221 becomes smaller when @xmath170 is larger .",
    "in conclusion , we find the constraints for the yukawa couplings @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath216 using the cleo measurement @xmath224 and respecting the restrictions due to the @xmath2 mixing and the @xmath4 parameter ( see @xcite for details ) .",
