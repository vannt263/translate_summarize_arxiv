    "i never had the pleasure of meeting dubravko tadi@xmath0 , which is a shame , since he and i worked on many parallel subjects over the years .",
    "an example of this is his recent work on hypernuclear decay@xcite as well as his early papers on what is usually called nuclear parity violation@xcite .",
    "it is the latter which i wish to focus on in this paper , which i dedicate to dubravko s memory .",
    "the cornerstone of traditional nuclear physics is the study of nuclear forces and , over the years , phenomenological forms of the nuclear potential have become increasingly sophisticated . in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) system ,",
    "where data abound , the present state of the art is indicated , for example , by phenomenological potentials such as av18 that are able to fit phase shifts in the energy region from threshold to 350 mev in terms of @xmath2 40 parameters .",
    "progress has also been made in the description of few - nucleon systems @xcite . at the same time , in recent years a new technique effective field theory ( eft) has been used in order to attack this problem using the symmetries of qcd @xcite . in this approach",
    "the nuclear interaction is separated into long- and short - distance components . in its original formulation @xcite , designed for processes with typical momenta comparable to the pion mass , @xmath3 , the long - distance component is described fully quantum mechanically in terms of pion exchange , while the short - distance piece is described in terms of a small number of phenomenologically - determined contact couplings .",
    "the resulting potential @xcite is approaching @xcite the degree of accuracy of purely - phenomenological potentials .",
    "even higher precision can be achieved at lower momenta , where all interations can be taken as short - ranged , as has been demonstrated not only in the @xmath1 system @xcite , but also in the three - nucleon system @xcite .",
    "precise @xmath4 values have been generated also for low - energy , astrophysically - important cross sections for reactions such as @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6@xcite .",
    "however , besides providing reliable values for such quantities , the use of eft techniques allows for the a realistic estimation of the size of possible corrections .    over the past nearly half century there",
    "has also developed a series of measurements attempting to illuminate the parity-_violating _ ( pv ) nuclear interaction .",
    "indeed the first experimental paper of which i am aware was that of tanner in 1957 @xcite , shortly after the experimental confirmation of parity violation in nuclear beta decay by wu et al .",
    "@xcite . following seminal theoretical work by michel in 1964 @xcite and that of other authors in the late 1960 s @xcite , the results of such experiments have generally been analyzed in terms of a meson - exchange picture , and in 1980 the work of desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) developed a comprehensive and general meson - exchange framework for the analysis of such interactions in terms of seven parameters representing weak parity - violating meson - nucleon couplings @xcite .",
    "the ddh interaction has become the standard setting by which hadronic and nuclear pv processes are now analyzed theoretically .",
    "it is important to observe , however , that the ddh framework is , at heart , a _ model _ based on a meson - exchange picture .",
    "provided one is interested primarily in near - threshold phenomena , use of a model is unnecessary , and one can instead represent the pv nuclear interaction in a model - independent effective - field - theoretic fashion , as recently developed by zhu et al.@xcite . in this approach , the low energy pv",
    "nn interaction is entirely short - ranged , and the most general potential depends at leading order on 11 independent operators parameterized by a set of 11 _ a priori _ unknown low - energy constants ( lec s ) .",
    "when applied to low - energy ( @xmath7 mev ) two - nucleon pv observables , however , such as the neutron spin asymmetry in the capture reaction @xmath8 , the 11 operators reduce to a set of five independent pv amplitudes which may be determined by an appropriate set of measurements , as described in @xcite , and an experimental program which should result in the determination of these couplings is underway .",
    "this is an important goal , since such interactions are interesting not only in their own right but also as background effects entering atomic pv measurements@xcite as well as experiments that use parity violation in electromagnetic interactions in order to probe nuclear structure@xcite .",
    "completion of such a low - energy program would serve at least three additional purposes :    * first , it would provide particle theorists with a set of five benchmark numbers which are in principle explainable from first principles .",
    "this situation would be analogous to what one encounters in chiral perturbation theory for pseudoscalars , where the experimental determination of the ten lec s appearing in the @xmath9 lagrangian presents a challenge to hadron structure theory . while many of the @xmath9 lec s are saturated by @xmath10-channel exchange of vector mesons , it is not clear _ a priori _ that the analogous pv nn constants are similarly saturated ( as assumed implicitly in the ddh model ) .",
    "* moreover , analysis of the pv nn lec s involves the interplay of weak and strong interactions in the strangeness conserving sector .",
    "a similar situation occurs in @xmath11 hadronic weak interactions , and the interplay of strong and weak interactions in this case are both subtle and only partially understood , as evidenced , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the well - known the @xmath12 rule enigma .",
    "the additional information in the @xmath13 sector provided by a well - defined set of experimental numbers would undoubtedly shed light on this fundamental problem . *",
    "finally , the information derived from the low - energy nuclear pv program would also provide a starting point for a reanalysis of pv effects in many - body systems . until now",
    ", one has attempted to use pv observables obtained from both few- and many - body systems in order to determine the seven pv meson - nucleon couplings entering the ddh potential , and several inconsistencies have emerged .",
    "the most blatant is the vastly different value for @xmath14 obtained from the pv @xmath15-decays of @xmath16f , @xmath17f and from the combination of the @xmath18 asymmetry and the cesium anapole moment@xcite .",
    "the origin of this clash could be due to any one of a number of factors .",
    "using the operator constraints derived from the few - body program as input into the nuclear analysis could help clarify the situation .",
    "it may be , for example , that the remaining combinations of operators not constrained by the few - body program play a more significant role in nuclei than implicitly assumed by the ddh framework .",
    "alternatively , truncation of the model space in shell model treatments of the cesium anapole moment may be the culprit . in any case , approaching the nuclear problem from a more systematic perspective and drawing upon the results of few - body studies would undoubtedly represent an advance for the field .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is not , however , to make the case for the effective field theory program  this has already been undertaken in @xcite .",
    "also , it is not our purpose to review the subject of hadronic parity violation  indeed there exist a number of comprehensive recent reviews of this subject@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , although the basic ideas of the physics are clearly set out in these works , because the nn interaction is generally represented in terms of a somewhat forbidding two - body interaction , any calculations which are done involve state of the art potentials and are somewhat mysterious except to those priests who preach this art .",
    "rather , in this paper , we wish to argue that this need not be the case . below we eschew a high precision but complex nuclear wavefunction approach in favor of a simple analytic treatment which captures the flavor of the subject without the complications associated with a more rigorous calculation .",
    "we show that , provided that one is working in the low energy region , one can use a simple effective interaction approach to the pv nn interaction wherein the the parity violating nn interaction is described in terms of just five real numbers , which characterize s - p wave mixing in the spin singlet and triplet channels , and the experimental and theoretical implications can be extracted within a basic effective interaction technique , wherein the nucleon interactions are represented by short range potentials .",
    "this is justified at low energy because the scales indicated by the scattering lengths@xmath19 fm , @xmath20 fm  are both much larger than the @xmath21 fm range of the nucleon - nucleon strong interaction .",
    "of course , precision analysis should still be done with the best and most powerful contemporary wavefunctions such as the argonne v18 or bonn potentials .",
    "nevertheless , for a simple introduction to the field , we feel that the elementary discussion given below is didactically and motivationally useful . in the next section",
    "then we present a brief review of the standard ddh formalism , since this is the basis of most analysis , as well as the eft picture in which we shall work . then in the following section",
    "we show how the basic physics of the nn system can be elicited in a simple analytic fashion , focusing in particular on the deuteron . with this as a basis we proceed to the parity - violating nn interaction and develop a simple analytic description of low energy pv processes .",
    "we summarize out findings in a brief concluding section",
    "the essential idea behind the conventional ddh framework relies on the fairly successful representation of the parity - conserving @xmath1 interaction in terms of a single meson - exchange approach .",
    "of course , this technique requires the use of strong interaction couplings of the lightest vector and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath22 whose values are reasonably well determined .",
    "the ddh approach to the parity - violating weak interaction utilizes a similar meson - exchange picture , but now with one strong and one weak vertex _cf . _",
    "fig . 1 .",
    "[ fig : ddh ]    we require then an effective parity - violating @xmath23 hamiltonian in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pch ] ) .",
    "the process is simplified somewhat by barton s theorem , which requires that , in the cp - conserving limit , which we employ , exchange of neutral pseudoscalars is forbidden @xcite . from general arguments , the effective hamiltonian for such interactions must take the form @xmath24 we see that there exist , in this model , seven unknown weak couplings @xmath14 , @xmath25 , ... however , quark model calculations suggest that @xmath26 is quite small @xcite , so this term is usually omitted , leaving parity - violating observables described in terms of just six constants .",
    "ddh attempted to evaluate such pv couplings using basic quark - model and symmetry techniques , but they encountered significant theoretical uncertainties . for this reason",
    "their results were presented in terms of an allowable range for each , accompanied by a `` best value '' representing their best guess for each coupling .",
    "these ranges and best values are listed in table [ tab0 ] , together with predictions generated by subsequent groups @xcite .    .weak",

    "the asymptotic wavefunctions of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states must be of the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the partial wave transition amplitude .",
    "at very low energy we may use the simple effective range approximation defined above @xmath32 to write @xmath33 then we have the representation @xmath34 and , comparing with a green s function solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath35 which is sometimes called the zero - range approximation ( zra ) and is equivalent to the contact potential used in the eft approach .",
    "the relation between the scattering and bound state descriptions can be obtained by using the feature that the deuteron wavefunction must be orthogonal to its @xmath28 counterpart .",
    "this condition reads @xmath36 which requires that @xmath37 .",
    "this necessity is also clear from the already mentioned feature that the deuteron represents a pole in @xmath38 in the limit as @xmath39_i.e .",

    "since @xmath41 fm , this equality holds to within 20% or so and indicates the precision of our approximation . in spite of this roughness , there is much which can be learned from this simple analytic approach .",

    "<S> using a recent reformulation of the analysis of nuclear parity - violation ( pv ) using the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) , we show how predictions for parity - violating observables in low energy light hadronic systems can be understood in an analytic fashion . </S>",
    "<S> it is hoped that such an analytic approach may encourage additional experimental work as well as add to the understanding of such parity - violating phenomena , which is all too often obscured by its description in terms of numerical results obtained from complex two - body potential codes . </S>"
