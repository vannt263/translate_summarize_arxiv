    "weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure can both distort and magnify the images of background sources .",
    "the former effect , cosmic shear , has been detected ( see @xcite for a review ) and holds great promise for the study of matter fluctuations on large scales .",
    "the latter effect , cosmic magnification , has yet to be detected convincingly but has been theoretically investigated in detail @xcite . in particular , a number of authors have studied magnification of type ia supernova , which have been employed as standard candles to measure the expansion history of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rms magnification of supernovae is expected to be at the @xmath1 level on arcminute scales , with the largest magnifications occurring near the centers of massive halos .    on scales larger than arcminutes , only modest shear and magnification at the sub - percent level",
    "are expected .",
    "the theoretically expected magnitude of shear fluctuations has been confirmed observationally in cosmic shear surveys .",
    "accordingly , it would be extremely surprising if observations contradicted the expected level of cosmic magnification , since statistical shear and magnification are related in a simple way . in principle , standard candles like type ia supernovae should offer a means of measuring the magnification caused by large scale structure , for example by cross - correlating supernova brightness with foreground galaxy overdensity . in practice ,",
    "all but the very highest redshift supernovae ( which suffer the most lensing ) are not expected to provide useful measurements of cosmic magnification , since even type ia sne are not perfect standard candles .",
    "the observed dispersion in supernova magnitudes is roughly @xmath2 , whereas fluctuations of only @xmath3 are expected from lensing @xcite .",
    "even if magnification and galaxy overdensity were perfectly correlated , we would expect to see only a weak correlation between supernova brightness and galaxy overdensity , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore a very large sample of snia would be needed to observe such an effect .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported a highly significant ( @xmath5 confidence ) detection of correlation between the magnitude of 55 supernovae and foreground galaxy overdensity on @xmath6 scales , corresponding to magnifications at the @xmath7 level .",
    "@xcite has claimed further evidence for gravitational magnification of the @xcite supernovae .",
    "if confirmed , these results would confound much of the conventional wisdom on magnification effects and would call into question previous cosmic shear measurements which detected much lower shear variance on these scales .",
    "additionally , if such a correlation exists , it is possible to correct for it and therefore significantly reduce the dispersion in supernova luminosities : the magnitude variance can be reduced by a factor @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this would be especially important for modern supernova surveys , which can calibrate supernova magnitudes nearly to 0.1 mag .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this issue by cross - correlating the most recent sample of cosmological type ia sne compiled by @xcite , with low redshift galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric catalogue .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "mag ] , we briefly review theoretical predictions for cosmic magnification on small scales .",
    "next , we describe the supernova sample and galaxy catalogue employed in our analysis .",
    "results are presented in  [ sec : analysis ] , and our conclusions are discussed in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the large scale distribution of matter in the universe can give rise to measurable gravitational lensing effects ( shear and magnification ) on background objects .",
    "the magnification factor @xmath9 depends on whether matter along the line of sight is preferentially over- or underdense compared to the mean .",
    "the local properties of the gravitational lens mapping are characterised by the convergence @xmath10 , which is proportional to the surface mass density projected along the line - of - sight , and the shear @xmath11 , which is related to the gravitational tidal field of the lensing mass distribution .",
    "the sdss population of galaxies with @xmath12 has a median redshift near 0.3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that angular scales of arcminutes correspond to length scales of mpc .",
    "on these scales , the convergence and shear fluctuations are small , @xmath13 . to leading order",
    "the magnification is approximately @xmath14 see @xcite for higher order corrections .",
    "observable effects are due to departures from the mean value of the magnification .",
    "it is therefore convenient to use the overmagnification @xmath15 .",
    "then , the cross - correlation between @xmath16 and the foreground matter overdensity traced by galaxies at an angular separation @xmath17 reads : @xmath18 in this expression",
    ", @xmath19 is the comoving distance along the line - of - sight , @xmath20 are angular diameter distances to lens , source , and from lens to source respectively , @xmath21 is the normalised distribution of galaxies along the line - of - sight , @xmath22 is the scale factor and @xmath23 is the matter power spectrum , calculated using @xmath24 and the fitting function of @xcite , and we assume that the linear bias @xmath25 for the galaxies and scales of interest @xcite . in principle , the bias of the detected galaxies should vary with redshift , but because the galaxy distribution is dominated by a narrow redshift interval , the use of a constant bias seems reasonable .",
    "if instead of the two - point correlation , we wanted the cross - correlation with galaxy overdensity smoothed on scale @xmath17 we would replace @xmath26 by @xmath27 .        figure [ mag ] shows the amplitude of this cross - correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath28 ( eq . [ eq_crosscorrelation ] ) .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath29 computed for different angular separations and the dashed line shows the integrated correlation , i.e.  the correlation between supernova magnitude and the number of galaxies within radius @xmath17 . for estimating these quantities we have used a galaxy redshift distribution peaking at @xmath30 and a wmap cosmology with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "black lines have been computed for supernova redshifts of @xmath35 ( the median redshift of our sample ) and gray lines for @xmath36 . as can be seen in this figure , magnifications of @xmath3 can be generated by structures on scales of a few arcminutes or larger .",
    "as an aside , it is perhaps worth noting that high redshift sources are expected to be more strongly perturbed by lensing fluctuations , both because the lensing efficiency increases with redshift , and because more distant sources are subject to lensing from structures along a greater path length .",
    "for example , sources at @xmath37 are typically magnified by @xmath38 by structures on scales of 1 .",
    "this has ramifications for pencil - beam surveys attempting to constrain dark energy with supernovae at high redshift , @xmath39 .",
    "for example , @xcite report the discovery of 16 snia in the goods field , over an area of 0.1 sq .",
    "lensing fluctuations are significantly correlated across this narrow field .",
    "if these high redshift supernovae played an important role in the constraints derived by @xcite , then their derived dark energy parameters could be significantly biased , for example by 5% in @xmath19 .",
    "fortunately , the 16 high redshift goods supernovae were negligible within the larger sample of 177 sne reported by @xcite , implying that their dark energy constraints were not appreciably biased .",
    "future wide area surveys , like the snap survey which expects to cover 20 sq .",
    "degrees , should also be undisturbed by correlated structure across their fields .",
    "we attempt to detect a correlation between supernova magnitude and galaxy overdensity using following data sets :    * for supernovae , we use the `` gold '' sample of 156 snia compiled by @xcite . for each supernova , the redshift , ( dust - corrected ) distance modulus , and extinction correction have been provided by these authors .",
    "the sn redshifts range from @xmath40 to 1.75 with an average value of @xmath41 .",
    "* for foreground galaxies , we use the second data release ( dr2 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite this dataset provides an efficient star / galaxy separation for objects with @xmath42 and a homogeneous density by requiring a seeing value greater than 1.5 .    of the 156 sne listed by @xcite , 55 fall within the sdss dr2 footprint .",
    "given the magnitude cut mentioned above , the average galaxy density is roughly @xmath43 arcmin@xmath44 .",
    "the list of snia that we use is given in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "@xcite used magnitude cuts in each field in order to restrict their galaxy counts to low redshifts objects and maximize the signal . in our case ,",
    "the bulk of sdss photometric galaxies are at redshifts @xmath45 , while the median sn redshift in our sample is @xmath46 .",
    "accordingly , the number of galaxies that will overlap the supernova redshift distribution of our sample will be largely negligible .",
    "for each of the 55 snia we first count the number of neighbours within an angular radius @xmath17 . the correlation between this number of neighbours and the absolute snia magnitude",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ scatterplot ] .",
    "the left panel shows , as a function of supernova magnitude , the distribution of galaxies located within 10  from the snia position , i.e. the angular scale where @xcite found the strongest correlation .",
    "the horizontal error bars correspond to the measurement error in the snia magnitudes quoted by @xcite , and the vertical errors correspond to the poisson noise of the galaxy counts .",
    "there is no apparent correlation in this scatter plot ; this will be quantified below .",
    "the right panel shows the same correlation but using stars instead of galaxies and allows us to check for possible systematics .    for each angular bin ,",
    "we have computed the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of neighbours ( galaxies or stars ) within a given angular separation from the supernova and @xmath49 is the sn absolute magnitude . neglecting the measurement uncertainties in each object , and",
    "accounting only for the scatter in the population , the error in the cross - correlation coefficient reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of snia . for cells of 10 radius ,",
    "we find @xmath52 and @xmath53 for galaxies and stars respectively .",
    "the result obtained by @xcite is therefore not reproduced in our analysis : no significant correlation is detected .    in fig .",
    "[ r_vs_theta ] we plot the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath54 as a function of @xmath17 . in this figure",
    ", we have counted galaxies within an annulus centred on each @xmath17 , so that the plotted errors are uncorrelated . for both galaxies and stars ,",
    "no significant correlation has been detected on any scale .     between sn magnitude and galaxy counts ( solid ) or star counts ( dashed ) , as a function of radius .",
    "the overplotted curves show the theoretical prediction for source redshifts of 0.6 and 2.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]",
    "using the `` gold '' sample of type ia supernovae given by @xcite and the galaxy distribution measured by sdss dr2 , we have investigated correlations between the brightness of the supernovae and the density of foreground galaxies , on scales of 1 - 10 .",
    "our analysis does not reproduce the recent results of @xcite , who detected a cross - correlation at high significance ( @xmath5 confidence ) on 10  scales .",
    "our result is in line with theoretical predictions : the @xmath55 rms magnification caused by large - scale structure on arcminute scales is negligible compared to the observed @xmath56 dispersion in supernova magnitudes .",
    "the number of sne used by @xcite closely matches the number used in our analysis .",
    "the main difference between the two analyses is that @xcite derive galaxy counts from the apm catalogue , whereas we have used counts from the sdss photometric catalogue .",
    "while the apm catalogue is based on scans of photographic plates taken with the uk schmidt telescope , the sdss uses modern ccds with high - quality imaging reaching down to much deeper magnitudes , providing a higher galaxy density .",
    "therefore we expect the sdss to be more suitable for investigating weak correlations .",
    "thus there is no evidence for a significant correlation between supernova brightness and foreground galaxy overdensity .",
    "such a correlation would be expected for a sample of weakly lensed supernovae . in this light ,",
    "the recently claimed detection of significant weak lensing in the @xcite sample by @xcite is somewhat surprising .",
    "further examination of the data presented by @xcite indicates that the effect appears to be dominated by a few outliers in the magnitude distribution , which @xcite ascribes to magnification factors @xmath57 , i.e.  strong lensing .",
    "this would imply a surprisingly high strong lensing rate ( @xmath58 ) among high @xmath59 supernovae , inconsistent with the strong lensing rate ( @xmath60 ) of distant quasars @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note that the theoretically expected sn - galaxy correlation ( solid curves in figure  [ r_vs_theta ] ) would be detectable with larger samples of supernovae with smaller flux errors .",
    "although the signal is not currently detectable using the @xcite supernovae and sdss galaxies , future datasets ( e.g.  snap ) should unambiguously exhibit the lensing signal on small scales .",
