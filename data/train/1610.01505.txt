    "the mass of the black holes is the same as the internal energy in usual thermodynamics whereas by employing the relation between the cosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure , it will be interpreted as the enthalpy .",

    "first of all , the horizon radius has polynomial - like behavior which indicates that there exists an extremum for the enthalpy .",
    "the dominant term for small black holes is the @xmath71 term , whereas , for large black holes , the @xmath72 term is dominant .",
    "since these parameters are positive valued , it is safe to say that the extremum for these black holes is actually a minimum .    due to the nature of @xmath72 , @xmath66 , @xmath15 , @xmath73 and @xmath34 , these parameters are positive and they have positive contributions to the values of the enthalpy . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 could be negative or positive .",
    "therefore , they could either contribute negativity or positivity to the enthalpy .",
    "if we consider the latter parameters to be positive , the enthalpy will be always positive without any root .",
    "but , if we take them to be negative valued , it may be possible to obtain one or two roots for enthalpy depending on the choices of different parameters .",
    "existence of negative enthalpy indicates that the system in this case is not a physical one .",
    "therefore , in this case ( presence of two roots for enthalpy ) , small and large black holes will be physical whereas the medium black holes will be non - physical .",
    "it is not possible to obtain root of the mass analytically .",
    "therefore , we employ numerical calculations and present the results in various diagrams ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath77      another thermodynamic quantity of interest is temperature . taking a closer look at the temperature",
    ", one can see that for large and small horizon radii , @xmath15 and @xmath72 are dominant terms , respectively . since @xmath15 term is negative and @xmath72 term is positive",
    ", one can conclude that at least one root exists for the temperature .",
    "this root separates the non - physical solutions with negative temperature from physical black holes with positive temperature .",
    "therefore , there exists a condition for having physical black holes with positive temperature which is @xmath78    it is worthwhile to mention that the presence of @xmath15 leads the temperature to diverge toward -@xmath79 in the limit of @xmath80 , faster .",
    "this is one of the effects of the presence of magnetic charge .",
    "in addition , one can see that @xmath81 in temperature is not coupled with horizon radius . here",
    ", it merely plays the role of a constant .",
    "due to the coupling of different parameters with varying orders of horizon radius , for every specific ranges of horizon radius , one of these terms could be dominant .",
    "this may lead to the presence of extrema for the temperature .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the extrema of temperature are given by @xmath82    the above obtained extrema for the temperature indicate that by suitable choices of different parameters , it may be possible to have one of the following cases :    \\i ) temperature being only an increasing function of the horizon radius without any extremum .",

    ", the dominant terms for small values of horizon radius will be @xmath85    now , it is possible to tune this relation in a way so that it vanishes .",
    "if we eliminate this relation , one can find the following relation for temperature @xmath86which for the limit of @xmath87 , it is non - zero ( for more details see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath88    remembering that in the evaporation of black holes by the hawking radiation mechanism , the horizon radius eventually vanishes . however , we see here that in this case , there will be a remnant for the temperature of black holes .",
    "this indicates that all the information regarding existence of the black holes is not vanished completely despite the statement of paradox information .",
    "in fact , a trace of existence of black holes will remain which presents itself as a fluctuation in temperature of the background spacetime where black hole was present .",
    "this specific property for the temperature is due to the existence of massive gravitons .",
    "this shows that generalization from massless gravitons to massive ones , introduces new properties to the thermodynamics of black holes which could solve and answer some long standing questions regarding the physics of black holes such as the information paradox .",
    "our next thermodynamical quantity of interest is the heat capacity .",
    "this quantity is of interest because of two important properties ; sign and divergencies .",
    "basically , the conditions regarding the stability of black holes could be attained by studying the sign of the heat capacity .",
    "the negativity of it shows that black holes are thermally unstable while the vice versa is true for stability . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that black holes go under second order phase transitions where they meet divergencies of the heat capacity .",
    "since we are working in extended phase space , heat capacity is given by @xmath89    by using the temperature ( [ totaltt ] ) and entropy ( [ totals ] ) , one can obtain the heat capacity of the massive charged dyonic black hole as @xmath90    in order to have positive heat capacity , the numerator and denominator of the heat capacity must be whether both negative or positive .",
    "the numerator of the heat capacity is exactly the same with positive condition that we found for the temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ post ] ) ) .",
    "since this relation is supposed to be positive , the denominator must also be positive to have a positive heat capacity , and hence , thermally stable solutions .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath91 in which by combining it with previous condition for having positive numerator , we obtain @xmath92    in conclusion , if eq .",
    "( [ poscq ] ) is satisfied , the heat capacity will be positive and black holes are thermally stable .",
    "on the other hand , divergencies of the heat capacity are obtained according to the following relation @xmath93    evidently , depending on the choices of different parameters , the heat capacity may come across one of the following cases :    \\i ) absence of divergency which is observed when it is not real valued .",
    "\\ii ) presence of only one divergency which takes place only when the following conditions for different parameters hold simultaneously @xmath94    \\iii ) existence of two divergencies .",
    "this case happens if both positive and negative branches of the obtained solutions are positive and real valued .",
    "therefore , another set of conditions are imposed for negative branch as well which are @xmath95    returning to the obtained divergency , let s examine different limiting cases .",
    "first of all , interestingly , the magnetic charge , @xmath15 is coupled with pressure and the only trace of the pressure in numerator is due to this term . in the absence of the magnetic charge , divergencies will be only decreasing functions of the pressure .",
    "this highlights the contribution and the effect of the magnetic charge in thermodynamical phase transition of these black holes .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that magnetic charge term is negative and its contribution is toward decreasing the value of divergencies . on the other hand , for electric part of the solutions , except for @xmath96 ,",
    "all the other terms including electric part contribute to negativity of the obtained divergencies . in the absence of electric part , for positive branches of the solutions",
    ", only magnetic charge term contributes to negativity .",
    "finally , the massive terms only contribute to positivity of the divergencies .",
    "this shows that thermodynamical phase transitions more likely take place in higher horizon radius for massive graviton cases compared to massless ones .",
    "this is the contribution of the massive gravity in thermodynamical structure of the black holes .",
    "later , we will present some diagrams and give interpretations regarding the thermodynamical behavior of black holes for mentioned divergencies , and hence , phase transitions .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that obtained divergencies for the heat capacity are the same as extrema that were extracted for temperature ( [ roott ] ) .",
    "the free energy is considered to be one of the thermodynamical potentials which could be used to derive other thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the free energy could also be employed to extract information regarding the phase transitions of the black holes and their chemical equilibrium .",
    "thermodynamically speaking , when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure , its free energy minimizes .",
    "this means that the presence of an extremum in free energy diagrams indicates that system undergoes a second order phase transition in that extremum .",
    "this point is known as equilibrium point and derivative of the free energy with respect to thermodynamical coordinate vanishes there .",
    "using obtained free energy ( [ free1 ] ) , it is a matter of calculation to show that roots of free energy are    @xmath97    obtained roots for the free energy is almost identical with obtained divergencies for the heat capacity with a few differences . here , magnetic charge term coupled with pressure is positive and therefore , its contribution is toward increasing the values of root .",
    "otherwise , same arguments that were mentioned for divergencies of the heat capacity , regarding the effects of different parameters , are valid for the roots of free energy as well .",
    "the equilibrium points for these black holes could be obtained by using the first derivative of the free energy with respect to thermodynamical coordinates . here",
    ", we choose horizon radius as our thermodynamical coordinate which leads to following equilibrium points @xmath98    a simple comparison shows that obtained equilibrium points are identical to extrema and divergencies which were extracted for the temperature and the heat capacity , respectively .",
    "now , since we have two roots and two extrema for the free energy , one of these cases may happen :    \\i ) existence of two roots and one extremum .",

    "\\iii ) absence of extremum and existence of only one root .",

    "in this section , we would like to see how different thermodynamical quantities that were studied and extracted are related to each other and how we should interpret phase transitions and thermal stability conditions .",
    "in studying temperature , heat capacity and free energy , it was shown that extrema of temperature , divergencies of the heat capacity and equilibrium points of free energy were located exactly at the same points . remembering that divergencies of the heat capacity are points at which black holes suffer second order phase transitions",

    "@xmath161    @xmath162    interestingly , for the cases where van der waals like diagrams present only one phase transition point ( pressure and temperature are the same as critical pressure and temperature ) , similarly , the heat capacity enjoys only one divergency in its diagrams ( middle panels of figs .",

    "such sudden changes in the size of the black holes would leave its traces in gravitational properties of the black holes , such as gravitational wave and quasi normal modes .",

    "it is necessary to study different phase diagrams in more details .",
    "the structure of the dyonic black holes admits a constant magnetic field in dual theory of conformal field theory on the boundary .",

    "interestingly , between two divergencies , we have positive susceptibility which presents a paramagnetic phase .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that both divergencies in the susceptibility are matched with two extrema in the temperature . remembering the results of previous sections regarding the regions of thermal stability",
    ", one can conclude that the region of paramagnetic solutions which is between two divergencies is thermally unstable . here ,",
    "when the boundary theory reaches smaller divergency , it jumps to the larger divergency .",
    "therefore , the system never experiences this specific region of the paramagnetism .",

    "the limiting cases were also studied and it was shown that existence of critical behavior is magnetic charge dependant .",
    "it was also pointed out that generalization to massive gravity leads to the presence of van der waals like behavior for non - spherical black holes .",
    "this essentially resulted into the existence of second order phase transitions in the boundary theory with non - spherical horizons ( hyperbolic and planar ) as well .",
    "furthermore , an alternative method was employed to extract critical points which presented themselves as maximums in the phase diagrams .",
    "more importantly , it was shown that the critical points that were extracted through different methods were consistent .",
    "in addition , a comparative study regarding thermal stability and van der waals like phase transition was done and thermodynamical behavior of the black holes in unstable regions was discussed .",
    "next , the properties of the boundary @xmath54 dual to the bulk theory were investigated .",
    "it was shown that depending on the choices of different parameters , the boundary theory may have ; only one paramagnetic phase , two paramagnetic and one diamagnetic phases , two paramagnetic and two diamagnetic phases with a phase transition between the two diamagnetic phases and finally , two paramagnetic and two diamagnetic phases with two phase transitions and one thermally unstable paramagnetic phase .",
    "finally , it was pointed out that the high temperature limit of holographical aspect is modified due to massive gravity .",
    "the correction terms were shown to be necessary in the expressions for temperature , susceptibility of boundary theory and curie law .",
