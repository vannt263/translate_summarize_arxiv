    "<S> in this communication , we propose a method for obtaining isolated excited states within the full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo framework . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows for stable sampling with respect to collapse to lower energy states and requires no uncontrolled approximations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with most previous methods to extract excited state information from quantum monte carlo methods , this results from a modification to the underlying propagator , and does not require explicit orthogonalization , analytic continuation , transient estimators or restriction of the hilbert space via a trial wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the propagator can directly yield frequency - domain correlation functions and spectral functions such as the density of states which are difficult to obtain within a traditional quantum monte carlo framework . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this approach with pilot applications to the neon atom and beryllium dimer .    </S>",
    "<S> almost all of the many variants of projector quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) rely on the properties of the operator @xmath0 , where due to its similarity to the time - evolution operator , the variable @xmath1 is denoted ` imaginary time ' . </S>",
    "<S> generally , this imaginary time is discretized , and the operator iteratively applied as a short - time propagator , in order to simulate its action in the large @xmath1 limit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> expressing an initial wavefunction in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian of interest , the application of this @xmath0 propagator results in a projection onto the @xmath2 eigenstate proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy of this eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear to see that in this large @xmath1 limit , the projection onto the lowest energy eigenvector dominates the wavefunction , whereby ground state properties can be extracted , assuming some overlap with the initial wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> while this formalism is clearly powerful , by construction it exponentially quickly projects out excited states of the system which may be of interest , and are of critical importance in the simulation of finite - temperature properties , reaction dynamics , photochemistry and many other areas .    to date , isolating excited states of systems via projector qmc methods has only been practical with a restriction on the projection to sample a space which is approximately orthogonal to those of the lower energy states , via nodal constraint@xcite , or orthogonalization against them in a subspace projection method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more indirectly , statistical methods have been used on short periods of imaginary - time in order to isolate individual decay rates in the spectrum by analytic continuation to a real - time dynamic@xcite . however , </S>",
    "<S> these approaches are not entirely satisfactory ; accurate nodal surfaces for excited states can be difficult to obtain , resulting in a larger fixed node error and potentially transient estimators , while the subspace projection method has limited applicability@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the bayesian techniques which rely on maximizing entropy to approximate a notoriously unstable inverse laplace transform , have difficulty achieving quantitative accuracy within noisy data sets @xcite . despite this , there are examples of accurate excited states within the nodal constraint@xcite , while maximum entropy techniques are particularly prevalent in solid state calculations to obtain the density of states , often in the case of continuous - time qmc as applied to quantum impurity models and dynamical mean - field theory@xcite .    here , we take a different approach to the calculation of excited states , within the context of full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo ( fciqmc)@xcite . this recently introduced method applies the imaginary - time evolution propagator to a stochastic ` walker ' representation of the wavefunction expressed in the full space of slater determinants constructed from a single - particle basis of size @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> although this reintroduces a basis set error compared to those methods operating in real space , it confers various advantages which mitigate this . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete basis allows for an efficient walker annihilation algorithm , which can exactly overcome the fermion sign problem in the sampling , provided enough walkers are used@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ` initiator ' approximation was formulated to maintain a high annihilation rate , and control the growth of noise in a systematically improvable fashion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has allowed far larger systems to be treated at an accuracy comparable to that of full configuration interaction ( fci or exact diagonalization ) , within small and systematically improvable error bars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a semi - stochastic adaptation of the algorithm@xcite , as well the introduction of a partial nodal constraint@xcite and ideas from quantum chemistry@xcite hold promise of increased accuracy and efficiency of the method .    in order to project out a targeted excited state rather than the ground state , </S>",
    "<S> we propose the use of a projection operator of the form @xmath6 for sufficiently large @xmath1 , this gaussian propagator will result in the dominant eigenstate being the one closest in energy to the chosen value of the diagonal offset @xmath7 , termed the shift . in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 representing the ground state , and starting from an initial wavefunction @xmath11 with @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , it can be seen that the long time propagation results in @xmath13 we note here that a projector of this form was proposed back in 1983 within continuum qmc approaches@xcite , although due to sign problems , and significantly larger timestep errors resulting from the fact that @xmath14 is more singular than @xmath8 , only one - electron systems were reported , and no modern implementation exists in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this issue of the timestep highlights another advantage of working in a finite basis , in that the spectrum is bounded both from below and above . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for linearization of the short - time propagator , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> repeated application of the short - time propagator therefore results in a ` power - method ' for states on the interior of the spectrum , rather than at the extrema , with similarities to filter diagonalization@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> propagation with eq </S>",
    "<S> .   leads to a theoretical decay of state @xmath16 from @xmath17 as @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the ground state propagator , this rate of decay depends on @xmath7 , with it being advantageous to choose @xmath7 to be as close to the energy of the state of interest as possible . </S>",
    "<S> however , even if @xmath7 is chosen exactly , the projection of the non - dominant states is slower compared to the ground state propagation , and we will return to this issue later . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , unless @xmath7 is chosen exactly , the long - time propagation of the dynamic will result in a continued projection onto a decaying function of all states , including the dominant one . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the factor of @xmath19 is introduced into the short - time propagator , such that at convergence , its value can be varied in order to maintain a constant l@xmath20 normalization of the dominant wavefunction and a stable number of walkers . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to the variation of @xmath7 in the ground state projection@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the differential formulation of the exact dynamic governed by this propagator for a given component of the wavefunction , @xmath21 , can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 as @xmath24 , and the application of @xmath14 has been decomposed by a resolution of the identity over the connecting space of determinants @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation is now amenable to stochastic integration with a discrete walker representation of the determinantal wavefunction coefficients @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> as with the ground state projection , there is no unique stochastic algorithm for this dynamic , but the one which we found to be most efficient involves a double spawning cycle , which requires little additional overhead compared to the ground state algorithm , and no additional memory requirements . </S>",
    "<S> each iteration , the determinants represented by @xmath26 are run through , and a spawning step attempted to determinant @xmath16 , in the same fashion as the ground state propagation , but in negative time . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a spawning probability to a connected determinant @xmath16 with a stochastically realised _ signed _ amplitude of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the normalised probability to randomly select symmetry - connected determinant @xmath16 from @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> successfully spawned walkers are subsequently propagated again in the same iteration with a now forwards - time signed amplitude of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> care must be taken that for determinant @xmath26 , the diagonal ` death ' processes from the first application of @xmath8 are now interpreted as spawning events , which are also subsequently propagated via @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> each iteration , the factor of @xmath19 is applied initially as a separate enhancement of the local population of each determinant , with the absolute population on each determinant growing with probability @xmath31 .     at 2.5  </S>",
    "<S>   separation in a cc - pvdz basis . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 was fixed at -3.65@xmath32 , and @xmath19 at 1.004 until 10,000 walkers were present , denoted by the dotted line , where @xmath19 was varied in order to keep this number constant . </S>",
    "<S> after variation , the average value of @xmath33 was 1.4(6)@xmath34 . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ he2conv ] , we present an illustrative example of the algorithm for the helium dimer in a cc - pvdz basis , small enough such that the full spectrum of eigenstates can be calculated and the convergence of the method analysed . the value of @xmath7 was fixed at @xmath35 higher than the second excited state , but such that it remained the dominant state in the dynamic , and was subsequently found to be correctly projected out over time . </S>",
    "<S> this is despite working in a canonical representation , and starting with a single walker on the hartree  </S>",
    "<S> fock determinant which had an initial overlap with the ground state of close to one . in order to grow the walkers , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 was initially fixed at a value of 1.004 , and was varied when a target number of walkers was reached , in common with the procedure for the ground state propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the projected energy , as defined in ref .  , </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ he2energy ] for the same simulation , and reflects the decay from the sampled wavefunction of the first excited state .        in order to reliably extend to larger molecular systems , </S>",
    "<S> it is worth considering how to transfer the salient elements of the initiator approximation into this new propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the basis of this approximation is to attempt to propagate walkers corresponding to wavefunction signal exactly , while walkers judged to be potentially noise are propagated with a truncated hamiltonian which acts only over the instantaneously occupied subspace@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is systematically improvable as the instantaneously occupied subspace grows , or the criterion for walkers corresponding to signal becomes more inclusive . </S>",
    "<S> the separation between walkers corresponding to signal and potential noise is not unique . </S>",
    "<S> however , it seems sensible to retain the tested feature from ground state propagation that newly spawned walkers on previously unoccupied determinants ( @xmath17 ) at the end of an iteration , must have come from an initial determinant ( @xmath26 ) which is deemed to have a well - established sign , and therefore a population of walkers above @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , all walkers from the application of the first hamiltonian operator are kept , while the information as to whether @xmath21 is above the initiator criterion is passed through to the annihilation stage of the final set of spawned walkers . </S>",
    "<S> no walkers are therefore aborted over the resolution of the identity between @xmath14 ( determinants @xmath16 in eq .  ) .    to test this on a larger system , </S>",
    "<S> we study an excited state deep in the spectrum of the 10-electron neon atom in a cc - pvdz basis , with an energy of approximately @xmath37 above the ground state . setting @xmath7 to equal the cisdtq energy for the corresponding state , and while remaining in a canonical hartree  </S>",
    "<S> fock basis and starting from a random distribution of walkers throughout the whole space , we achieved a converged energy of -126.2118(4)@xmath32 , compared to the fci value of -126.21177@xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is @xmath38 lower than the initial guess provided by cisdtq </S>",
    "<S> . it would be highly advantageous to develop a robust algorithm for varying @xmath7 dynamically during the run , as is done for the ground state algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this could be used to maximise the rate of growth of walkers or alternatively minimize @xmath19 , both of which should adjust @xmath7 to more closely match the eigenvalue of the state , remove reliance on the initial guess and increase the convergence rate . however , since this requires finding a minimum in a quadratically varying and noisy dataset , no robust algorithm has been identified so far .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamic correlation and response functions due to some perturbation , either in the frequency or time domain , are of critical importance in electronic structure theory@xcite , and are directly measured in experiments to probe the electronic properties of materials through techniques such as neutron scattering or photoelectron spectroscopy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many methods , including in general qmc approaches , have significant difficulty in calculating these quantities@xcite , often having to rely on unstable analytic continuation from imaginary time correlation functions@xcite , while other methods can bias towards high or low energy regimes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although other correlation functions are possible , here we look at the example of an advanced green s function , a central concept in electronic structure where the ` perturbation ' at time @xmath39 is the creation of a hole in orbital @xmath16 . for negative time periods , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 , these can be written in the time and frequency domain respectively as @xmath41 unlike the inverse laplace transform required for the analytic continuation of imaginary time correlation functions , the transform between these two domains is a well - conditioned and numerically stable fourier transform in the presence of noisy data . </S>",
    "<S> spectral density functions , such as the density of states for extended systems , are then defined in the lehmann representation@xcite as @xmath42   \\\\                  & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sum_{n}\\frac{\\langle \\psi_0^{n}|a^{\\dagger}_i|\\psi_n^{n-1}\\rangle \\delta \\langle \\psi_n^{n-1 } | a_j | \\psi_0^{n } \\rangle}{(\\omega - e_n^{n-1}+e_0^n)^2+\\delta^2 }   , \\label{eqn : shorttimespectral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in the small @xmath43 limit tends to @xmath44 where @xmath43 in the above equation represents the dirac - delta function .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath45 , application of the propagator in eq .   for a time @xmath46 will result in the wavefunction @xmath47 which when applied to an initial wavefunction @xmath48 obtained from the ground - state dynamic , and then projected onto @xmath49 will result in the distribution @xmath50 for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this will tend to the spectral function given in eq .   in the large @xmath1 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the real parts of the green s function can then by obtained if needed from the kramers - kronig relation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a related green s function can be obtained directly by integrating eq .   over @xmath1 , with the addition of the small imaginary component @xmath43 to the dynamic . unfortunately however , this integral is only convergent for @xmath52 , and so the fciqmc calculation will blow up at the poles . in systems with a continuous spectra , this would not be appropriate , and so we do not pursue this approach here . </S>",
    "<S> results from a pilot investigation of the beryllium dimer in a cc - pvdz basis , where the exact green s function can be obtained from complete diagonalization , are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ beryllium ] .     for exact propagation with @xmath53 , and stochastic evaluation via fciqmc for an equivalent time @xmath54a.u . for frozen - core be@xmath55 in a cc - pvdz basis at 2.5  . </S>",
    "<S> vertical lines indicate the difference between the ground state energy and the eigenvalues of the n-1 system symmetry connected in @xmath56 , although some are coupled too weakly to contribute significantly to the spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 10 independent calculations at each value of @xmath57 were averaged to obtain the errorbars . ]    in order to reduce the statistical error , it may be necessary to average over a small number of independent calculations at each frequency , and this can be combined with an elimination of the bias derived from choosing a correlated sample of @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite , by taking the @xmath10 samples on each side of eq .   from different snapshots in imaginary time . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by storing multiple wavefunctions of the type @xmath58 at the same time , all @xmath60 single - particle green s functions can be calculated at a cost of @xmath61 $ ] fciqmc calculations per frequency point , without the expectation of any variation in accuracy between high and low energy regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> however , despite modest successes , it is clear that obtaining converged results through the use of this operator is substantially more difficult than with the ground state projection . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to an additional factor of @xmath62 in the number of iterations required to project out undesired states with energy gap @xmath63 for comparable accuracy to the ground state propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that while in the ground state propagation excited states were filtered relatively quickly with only isolated convergence issues in the case of near degeneracy@xcite , the number of iterations required for excited state propagation are substantially increased , as well as the dynamic being less well - conditioned with respect to walker fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is also exacerbated by a generally more multiconfigurational wavefunction which increases random error in the projected energy estimator@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more judicious choice of orbital basis and initial conditions optimized for the state of interest , as well as a multireference projected energy formulation@xcite would ameliorate many of these issues . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is the possibility of preconditioning techniques familiar from iterative diagonalization methods@xcite being transferred into the stochastic dynamic , as well other operators , such as @xmath64 , which should behave more efficiently and allow for extension to larger systems . </S>",
    "<S> research in these directions is currently under way . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that alternative propagators within the fciqmc dynamic holds promise for obtaining accurate excited states . </S>"
