    "we detect spatially compact brackett-@xmath13 and paschen-@xmath16 line emission from the dso / g2 at about 30 - 40  mas east of sgra*. this is in agreement with the position reported by ghez et al .",

    "no strong blue - shifted emission above the noise level is detected at the position of sgra * or any position upstream the presumed orbit .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the brackett-@xmath13 line is  50  , i.e. , no significant line broadening with respect to 2013 is observed .",
    "this is a further indication for the compactness of the source . for the moment",
    ", the flaring activity of the black hole in the near - infrared regime has not shown any statistically significant increment .",
    "we conclude that the dso / g2 source had not yet reached its peribothron before may 2014 and that the increased accretion activity of sgra * is still upcoming .    through jalali",
    "2014 ) we have shown how young and dusty stellar objects can be formed in the immediate vicinity of a super - massive black hole .",
    "the observational data was also used to derive the orbit of this object and to predict its peribothron transition . due to the presumably high ellipticity of the orbit only very weakly curved sections of the orbit were available and first predictions of the peribothron transition time in 2013 ( gillessen et al .",
    "2012 ) proved to be incorrect .",
    "the inclusion of ( or even restrictions to ) the br@xmath13 line emission resulted in new predictions for very early 2014 .",
    "the fact that in the l-band the telescope point spread function ( psf ) is intrinsically larger and therefore more susceptible to diffuse extended emission is , probably the main reason for this discrepancy .",
    "however , the predicted interactions of the gas and dust with the strong gravitational field of sgra * have shown that the gas itself may also not be a good probe of the exact orbital motion .",
    "this is supported by the spatial extent and the velocity gradient across the br@xmath13 line emission .",
    "it is also highlighted by the expected interaction of the dso with the ambient medium and the gravitational field .",
    "therefore , even though the recently derived br@xmath13 based orbital solutions are in reasonable agreement ( meyer et al .",
    "2014 ) , the orbital elements may still be uncertain . using the results of our measurements with sinfoni in 2014 and the published keck data ( meyer et al .",
    "2014 ) we revisited the determination of the dso / g2 orbit .",
    "given the red emission is only about 40  mas east of sgra * and at a radial velocity of about 2700 km / s and only a blue - shifted line emission at about @xmath173200 m/s was measured after may 2014 , we obtained a new orbital solution which places the peribothron passage in mid - may 2014 , rather than in 2014.2 as estimated earlier by meyer et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . however , the orbital elements are very similar to the ones derived earlier . with the high ellipticity and half - axis length around 30  mpc",
    "we obtain a peribothron distance of the order of 120  au ( fig .",
    "[ orbit ] ) .",
    "eckart et al . (",
    "2012 ) model the mm- to x - ray spectrum of the sgra * flare emission with a synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) mechanism .",
    "they show that the flare emission can be described via a combination of a ssc model followed by an adiabatic expansion of the source components ( e.g. eckart et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this involves up - scattered sub - millimeter photons from a compact source component that has a spectrum which at the start of the flare peaks at frequencies between several 100 ghz and 2 thz .",
    "the overall radio - spectrum peaks close to 300 ghz .",
    "details of the sub - millimeter emission of sgra * and the surrounding circum nuclear disk is given in garcia - marin et al .",
    "a combined ssc and adiabatic expansion model can easily explain the observed flare fluxes and time delays that cover the spectral range from x - rays to the mm - radio domain .",
    "so far in the x - ray observable @xmath18  kev band no elevated continuum flux density level or extraordinary x - ray variability - possibly triggered by the dso fly - by - has been reported ( haggard et al .",
    "2014 ; atel # 6242 ) such an extra emission would have been expected to originate from the shock - heated gas ( gillessen et al .",
    "although sgra * is extremely faint in the x - ray regime , it is strongly variable in this domain of the electromagnetic spectrum ( baganoff et al . 2001 , 2003 ,",
    "porquet et al . 2003 , 2008 , eckart et al .",
    "2012 , nowak et al .",
    "2012 , barrire et al .",
    "2014 , mossoux et al . 2015 , neilsen et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the statistical investigation of the near - infrared variability by witzel et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggests that the past strong x - ray variations are potentially linked with the origin of the observed x - ray echos from a putative strong sgra * flare ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2004 , sunyaev & churazov 1998 , terrier et al .",
    "2010 , capelli et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "if the underlying mechanism for the nir / x - ray continuum spectrum of the sgra * flare emission is indeed a combination of synchrotron radiation and x - ray radiation through the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) process then the bright required x - ray flare fluxes can be explained as a natural phenomenon and no exceptional variability event needs to be claimed .",
    "all these phenomena make sgra * an ideal source to study the physics of extremely low luminosity super massive black holes .",
    "events like the fly - by of the dso may dominate the variability of galactic nuclei in this phase across the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "however , the onset of the activity phase of the magnetar psr  j1745 - 2900 at a separation of only about 3 arcseconds from the galactic center presented a problem for the sgra * monitoring program in 2013 ( mori et al .",
    "2013 , shannon & johnston 2013 , rea et al . , 2013 ) and required higher angular resolution to discern the sources .      linear polarization at 2.2@xmath12 m and its statistics and time variation constrain the physical conditions of the accretion process onto this super - massive black hole . with an exponent @xmath19@xmath04 of the slope of the number density histogram for flare fluxes above 5mjy ( see definition in shahzamanian et al . 2015 and witzel et al .",
    "2012 ) , the distribution of polarized flux density is closely linked to the single state power - law distribution of the total @xmath20-band flux densities reported earlier .",
    "closely following the concepts we laid out in witzel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) we find typical polarization degrees of the order of 10% to 20% and a preferred polarization angle of 13@xmath21@xmath2215@xmath21 .",
    "simulations show the uncertainties are probably dominated by observational effects , implying independently of flux density , that the intrinsic polarization degree and angle are rather well constrained . since the emission is due to optically thin synchrotron radiation , this preferred polarization angle is very likely coupled to the intrinsic orientation of the sgra * system , i.e. a disk or jet / wind scenario associated with the super - massive black hole . if they are indeed linked to the structural features of the source the data imply a rather stable geometry and accretion process for the sgra * system .",
    "as we did not detect a strong blue - shifted side of the br@xmath13 emission - at least in the predicted strength , a prime working hypothesis is that the dso is a young accreting star .",
    "there may be an extension to its dust shell and the current estimates of the orbit ( assuming a bound elliptical orbit ) bring it quite close to the black hole such that we can not exclude that it may come to an increased activity of sgra*. with respect to previous investigations of short and long term variability of sgra * no deviation from ` normal ' activity has been observed until now ( witzel et al . 2012 ; zamaninasab et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; eckart et al .",
    "excess of short time flares ( with an orbital time scale of 20min or shorter ) would have allowed us to study accretion disk physics , turbulences in a disk or highly fractal accretion stream .",
    "further spectroscopic measurements of the dso are required to track it along the high acceleration part of its orbit in order to get a proper determination of its actual orbit . in the beginning of 2013 the l-band identification of the dso",
    "got confused .",
    "therefore , it is essential to check the l-band identification after peribothron to answer the question : does the source simply move out of confusion or has the dust interacted with the ism ( enhanced density and radiation field ) near the central black hole ?",
    "young accreting pre - main sequence stars are usually variable .",
    "the line emission currently shows no strong ( @xmath2330% ) variability over the past years - it is , however , essential to monitor the strength of the line emission since variability may contribute to the identification of the object as a young star .",
    "it is currently unclear what the role of the so called ` tail emission ' of the g2/dso source is .",
    "it can best be seen in its br@xmath13 line emission .",
    "a future determination of its motion ( line of sight and proper motion ) will help to decide if it accelerates , and potentially belongs to the dso , or whether it belongs to the general back- and foreground emission ( potentially associated with the mini - spiral ) that is abundant and wide spread in the central parsec of the milky way .",
    "our polarization statistics show that sgra * must be a very stable system - both in terms of geometrical orientation of a jet or accretion disk and in terms of the variability spectrum which must be linked to the accretion rate .",
    "hence , polarization and variability measurements are the ideal tool to probe for any change in the system as a function of the dso fly - by ( shahzamanian et al .",
    "2015 ) . in order to make progress in understanding the physical processes responsible for the radio to x - ray emission of sgra",
    "* , and to better discern the flaring non - thermal from the extended non - variable bremsstrahlung component ( baganoff et al . 2003 ) it is imperative for future x - ray missions to provide higher angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "this will then allow us to expand our studies to the x - ray flux density variations in faint phases .",
    "the possible counterparts of these fainter x - ray variations could the be studied in the nir and radio domain .",
    "higher sensitivity in the x - ray domain may also open the door to search and potentially find line emission from the immediate vicinity of sgra*. alternatively , this could be achieved for particularly bright x - ray flares as well .",
    "x - ray line emission could be used as a further tool to study the dynamics of matter ( e.g. , valencia - s .",
    "et al . 2012 ) near the super - massive black hole .",
