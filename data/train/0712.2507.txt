    "magnetism in low - dimensional compounds which are modeled by quantum spin systems has been a subject of intense study in recent years . among the experimental techniques which are used to probe various characteristics of magnetic systems the dynamic experiments are very important . due to their high sensitivity and resolution",
    "they are among the basic tools to determine the detailed magnetic interactions .",
    "however , the correct interpretation of the experimental data requires a corresponding theoretical background .",
    "usually the theories based on mean - field approximation or classical spin picture are not sufficient to explain dynamic phenomena in low - dimensional quantum spin systems in which quantum fluctuations may be very strong ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the present work",
    "we examine rigorously the dynamic properties of a quantum spin chain with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "the latter interaction is often present in low - dimensional magnetic insulators .",
    "although its value is usually small it may cause noticeable changes in different observable characteristics of magnetic systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in our study we restrict ourselves to the spin-@xmath0 isotropic @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) chain in a ( @xmath2 ) transverse magnetic field with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction directed along @xmath2-axis in spin space @xcite .",
    "that model is equivalent to a chain of free spinless fermions . in fermionic language , the ising component of exchange coupling ( or other components of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction as well as the external magnetic field directed along other axes in spin space ) corresponds to interaction between spinless fermions and makes the problem much more complicated .",
    "although the spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 chain can be mapped onto a free spinless fermion chain , the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the spin model is not trivial at all .",
    "the @xmath3 spin correlation function corresponds to the density - density correlation function for spinless fermions and its calculation is relatively easy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the other ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) spin correlation functions are more complicated quantities due to the nonlocal character of the jordan - wigner relation between the spin raising / lowering operators and the creation / annihilation fermion operators .",
    "the explicit analytical results for them are available in the high - temperature limit @xcite and in the ground state for strong fields @xcite . from refs .",
    "@xcite we know also the asymptotic behavior of some time - dependent spin correlation functions in particular limiting cases .",
    "on the other hand , the time - dependent spin correlation functions ( and the related dynamic structure factors and dynamic susceptibilities ) can be computed numerically @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we employ the jordan - wigner fermionization supplemented by further analytical and numerical calculations to perform a comprehensive analysis of the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the dynamic structure factors of the spin-@xmath0 @xmath8 chain in a transverse field .",
    "the previous studies of the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction were restricted to transverse ( @xmath3 ) dynamics @xcite and to the dynamics of correlations between @xmath10 and @xmath11 spin components at infinite temperature @xcite .",
    "in particular , the transverse dynamic susceptibility @xmath12 was found at @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we also notice that a relation between the @xmath1 chains without and with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the grounds of symmetry was discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the transverse dynamics was not discussed in the context of the two - fermion excitation continuum @xcite . moreover , to our best knowledge , the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 dynamic structure factors away from the infinite temperature limit has never been studied before .",
    "we must note here that the dynamic properties of a more general model , the spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnetic @xmath15 heisenberg chain , with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction were explored in refs",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite , using symmetry arguments it is shown that although the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction may leave the spectrum of the problem unchanged , it can essentially influence the spin correlations / dynamic susceptibilities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin correlation functions / dynamic susceptibilities of the chain with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction are expressed in terms of such quantities of a @xmath16 chain .",
    "however , the results for the latter chain are restricted to the limit of wavevectors close to @xmath17 , low energies and low temperatures .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ( sec . [ s2 ] ) we introduce the model , define the quantities of interest and make some remarks on symmetry .",
    "then , in the next two sections ( secs",
    ". [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] ) we analyze the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor and the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) dynamic structure factors , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] we discuss the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the electron spin resonance absorption spectrum . in the last section ( sec .",
    "[ s6 ] ) we briefly summarize our findings .",
    "some preliminary results of the present paper are reported in the conference papers @xcite .",
    "the model to be studied is a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath18 spins @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the halves of the pauli matrices , @xmath21 is the @xmath8 exchange interaction , @xmath22 is the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , and @xmath23 is the transverse magnetic field .",
    "we imply in ( [ 01 ] ) both periodic boundary conditions ( in analytical computations ) and open boundary conditions ( in numerical computations ) bearing in mind that the results which pertain to the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 are insensitive to the boundary conditions imposed .",
    "we are interested in the dynamic structure factors of the model ( [ 01 ] ) which can be expressed through the time - dependent spin correlation functions as follows @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes the canonical thermodynamic average and @xmath26 is the heisenberg representation of the operator @xmath27 . note that the diagonal components of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , are real and nonnegative but the off - diagonal components of @xmath28 , @xmath30 should not necessarily be real .    first of all we note that the spin model ( [ 01 ] ) possesses a number of symmetries which permit to reduce the range of parameters and simplify studies of the properties of the model . after performing a @xmath31-rotation of all spins about the @xmath2-axis we conclude that @xmath32 and @xmath33 and therefore , the only dynamic structure factors which remain to examine are @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we also note , that making use of the transformation @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 we arrive at ( [ 01 ] ) with the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and as a result , @xmath42 , @xmath43 but @xmath44 . a similar transformation , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , yields ( [ 01 ] ) with the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath40 , @xmath23 ; this symmetry implies that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "finally , the renumbering of sites @xmath52 , @xmath53 gives again ( [ 01 ] ) with the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath40 , @xmath23 and hence @xmath54 , @xmath55 .    in our study",
    "an important role is played by a gauge transformation that eliminates the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction from the hamiltonian ( [ 01 ] ) at the expense of renormalized @xmath8 exchange interaction ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "explicitly , this spin coordinate transformation reads @xmath56 with the aid of ( [ 03 ] ) we find that the hamiltonian ( [ 01 ] ) becomes @xmath57 eq . ( [ 04 ] ) corresponds to the model without the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , however , with the renormalized @xmath8 exchange interaction @xmath58 . in what follows we use the large body of existing knowledge about the model ( [ 04 ] ) to obtain the properties of the model with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( [ 01 ] ) exploiting the transformation ( [ 03 ] ) . in principle , no new calculations ( in comparison with those reported in @xcite ) are needed . moreover , in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we make use of the results for @xmath36 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the physical meaning of which were nebulous and not obvious earlier . to close this section",
    ", we note that the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction can not be detected from measurements of the thermodynamic quantities since these quantities can not distinguish between the models ( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 04 ] ) related through the unitary transformation ( [ 03 ] ) .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction can be determined from some of the dynamic quantities .",
    "we start with the transverse dynamic structure factor . since the spin rotations ( [ 03 ] ) do not affect the @xmath2 spin component we immediately obtain the following expression for the transverse dynamic structure factor of the spin chain ( [ 01 ] ) @xmath59 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 05 ] ) , the transverse dynamics is conditioned by a continuum of two - fermion ( particle - hole ) excitations .",
    "the properties of the two - fermion excitation continuum were studied in detail in refs .",
    "we need these results in what follows and therefore present them here for easy reference . for later convenience",
    "we introduce the following characteristic lines in the @xmath60@xmath61 plane @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 where the parameter @xmath65 varies from @xmath31 when @xmath66 to @xmath67 when @xmath68 .",
    "( we notice that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used another parameter @xmath69 , @xmath70 . )    the ground - state transverse dynamic structure factor does not vanish until @xmath71 and may have nonzero values only within a restricted region of the @xmath60@xmath61 plane ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) with the lower boundary @xmath74 and the upper boundary @xmath75 if @xmath76 or @xmath77 if @xmath78 . as it follows from ( [ 06 ] ) , the soft modes occur at @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , the transverse dynamic structure factor exhibits a finite jump along the middle boundary @xmath80 , @xmath78 .",
    "finally , @xmath34 diverges along the curve @xmath81 .",
    "this is the van hove density - of - states effect in one dimension . with growing temperature",
    "the lower boundary becomes smeared out and finally disappears .",
    "the upper boundary at nonzero temperatures is given by @xmath82 ( [ 08 ] ) and @xmath34 exhibits the one - dimensional van hove singularity along this boundary .",
    "the transverse dynamic structure factor becomes field - independent in the high - temperature limit .",
    "clearly , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction does not manifest itself in the transverse dynamics .",
    "again we can not distinguish the quantities probing transverse spin dynamics for the spin-@xmath0 @xmath8 chain with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and for the spin-@xmath0 @xmath8 chain without the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction but with renormalized @xmath8 exchange interaction . in the next section",
    "we show what particular dynamic characteristics can unambiguously indicate the presence of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "we turn to the remaining dynamic structure factors . exploiting the transformation ( [ 03 ] ) one finds the relations between the @xmath4 and @xmath6 dynamic structure factors ( [ 02 ] ) of the model ( [ 01 ] ) ( the l.h.s .",

    "( [ 09 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) and the long known results for dynamics of the model ( [ 04 ] ) to explore the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on @xmath4 and @xmath6 dynamics .",
    "we begin with the case of infinite temperature @xmath85 @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath6 time - dependent spin correlations at different sites vanish and only the autocorrelations survive , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( in that case ( i.e. when only autocorrelations survive ) according to ( [ 03 ] ) we have simply @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; this result for the model ( [ 01 ] ) , which follows by symmetry from the results for the model ( [ 04 ] ) , was also derived earlier by direct calculation @xcite ( see eq .",

    "explicitly , the closed - form expressions for these quantities read @xmath90 and @xmath91 thus , in the high - temperature limit @xmath85 the @xmath4 and @xmath6 dynamic structure factors are @xmath60-independent and display a single gaussian ridge at @xmath92 .    in the case of finite temperatures @xmath93 we do not have analytical expressions for the dynamic structure factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the model ( [ 04 ] ) but these can be found numerically for chains of several hundreds of sites . following",
