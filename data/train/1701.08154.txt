    "a few years ago we began a search for wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars in the magellanic clouds ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ( massey et al . 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ) ) .",
    "as i write this proceeding , we have just finished our forth year of observations and have imaged the entire optical disks of both the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "we will likely have a few candidate wrs left to spectroscopically confirm after this season of imaging , but so far our efforts have been quite successful .",
    "we have discovered four wn - type stars , one wo - type star , eleven of - type stars , and ten stars that appear to belong to an entirely new class of wr star .",
    "the ten stars , as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ( left ) , exhibit strong wn3-like emission line features as well as o3v star absorption lines . while one might instinctively think these are wn3 stars with ov3 binary companions",
    ", this can not be the case .",
    "they are faint with @xmath1 .",
    "an o3v by itself has an absolute magnitude of @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( conti 1988 ) ) so these stars can not contain an o - type star companion .",
    "we call these stars wn3/o3s where the  slash \" represents their composite spectra . as mentioned previously , we have found ten of these stars , or 6.5% of the lmc wr population . as figure",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( right ) shows , all of their spectra are nearly identical .",
    "given that these stars are not wn3 stars with o3v companions , we were interested to see if we could model their spectra as single stars .",
    "we obtained medium dispersion optical spectra for all ten wn3/o3s in addition to high - dispersion optical spectra for one wn3/o3 , uv spectra for three wn3/o3s , and nir spectra for one wn3/o3 . for lmc170 - 2",
    "we obtained spectra from all four sources giving us coverage from 1000 - 2500 . to model these stars we turned to cmfgen , a spectral modeling code that contains all of the complexities needed to model hot stars near their eddington limits (",
    "* ( hillier & miller 1998 ) ) .",
    "using cmfgen , we began by modeling the spectrum of lmc170 - 2 .    using the parameters given in table  [ tab : params ]",
    ", we obtained a good fit to both the emission and the absorption lines for lmc170 - 2 .",
    "hainich et al .",
    "( 2014 ) recently modeled most of the previously known wn - type wrs in the lmc using powr and thus we can compare the star s physical parameters with those of more  normal \" wn - type lmc wrs .",
    "we can additionally compare the parameters with those of lmc o3vs .",
    "table  [ tab : params ] shows that the abundances and he / h ratio are comparable with lmc wn3s .",
    "figure  [ fig : pots ] ( left ) shows that while the temperature is a bit on the high side of what one would expect for a lmc wn , it is still within the expected temperature range .",
    "however , the biggest surprise is the mass - loss rate .",
    "as is shown in table  [ tab : params ] , the mass loss rate of the wn3/o3s is more similar to that of an o3v than of a normal lmc wn .",
    "this is shown visually in figure  [ fig : pots ] ( right ) .",
    ".physical parameters of wn3/o3s , wns , and o3vs in the lmc@xmath3 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "now that we have a good handle on their physical parameters , we are currently investigating possible wn3/o3 progenitors as well as their later stages of evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : locations ] shows where the wn3/o3s are located within the disk of the lmc .",
    "if they were all grouped together , we might assume that they formed out of the same stellar nursery .",
    "instead , they are pretty evenly spaced across the lmc .",
    "there are other non - binary wrs with hydrogen absorption lines denoted as wnha stars .",
    "? * martins et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ) has argued that the majority of these stars evolved through quasi - homogeneous evolution . in this case , the stars have high enough rotational velocities that the material in the core mixes with the material in the outer layers .",
    "this creates cno abundances near equilibrium , much as we find in the wn3/o3s .",
    "however , the wn3/o3s have relatively low rotational velocities ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) and extremely low mass - loss rates .",
    "it is difficult ( if not impossible ) to imagine an scenario where a star could begin its life with a large enough rotational velocity ( typically @xmath6 km s@xmath5 ) to produce homogeneous evolution and later slow down to 150 km s@xmath5 given the small mass - loss rates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( song et al . 2016 ) ) . instead",
    ", a homogeneous star must have either a larger rotational velocity or a larger mass - loss rate .",
    "so , at this point we can rule out quasi - homogeneous evolution .",
    "* drout et al .  ( 2016 ) ) looked at various types of supernovae progenitors and found that wn3/o3s , with their low mass - loss rates and high wind velocities , might be the previously - unidentified progenitors of type ic - bl supernovae .",
    "a subset of these type ic - bl supernovae then turn into long - duration gamma ray bursts which are preferentially found in low metallicity environments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( vink et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "thus , we are currently in the process of investigating any metallicity dependence for the formation of wn3/o3s .",
    "so far we have only found them in the low metallicity lmc .",
    "given the high number of wrs currently known in the milky way , we would expect to have found at least a few of them .",
    "however , these dim wrs with strong absorption lines have not been found elsewhere . to investigate any metallicity dependence ,",
    "we have decided to begin another search for wrs in m33 which has a strong metallicity gradient .",
    "we previously conducted a search for wrs in m33 but our previous survey simply did not go deep enough , as figure  [ fig : m33 ] shows .",
    "so , there may be an entire yet undiscovered population of wn3/o3s within m33 .",
    "we continue to discuss the evolutionary status of these wn3/o3s with our theoretician colleagues while also observationally attempting to determine where these stars come from and what they turn into . by searching for them in m33",
    "we should be able to constrain their metallicity dependence and gain further insight into their evolution ."
