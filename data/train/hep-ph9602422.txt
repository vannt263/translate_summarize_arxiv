    "the spin - dependent ( gamow - teller ) matrix - elements , for transitions between members of the baryon octet @xcite acquired renewed interest after measurements were made of the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of polarized leptons by polarized protons and neutrons @xcite , which provided valuable information about the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "one of the most important quantities measured in polarized dis is the longitudinal spin structure function @xmath2 . in the quark parton model , the spin structure function @xmath2",
    "is directly related to the quark spin densities : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc .",
    "where @xmath6 .    to deduce the various quark spin densities from the @xmath2 data",
    ", one usually assumes that baryons may be assigned to a su(3 ) flavor octet and uses the relation between the quark spin densities and weak matrix elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 from hyperon semileptonic decays . by using the earlier @xmath0 value ,",
    "the emc data led to the unexpected conclusion @xcite that the quarks carry at most a small part of the spin of either nucleon and furthermore , that there is a significant contribution from `` strange '' quarks , which necessarily come from the `` sea '' of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "this has led to many different suggestions for resolution of what has come to be called the `` spin crisis '' @xcite . among these",
    "is a suggestion @xcite that the conclusions may be distorted because the @xmath0 value obtained from the hyperon semileptonic decays are based on exact su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects may significantly change the value .",
    "there are many works attempting to evaluate the su(3)-breaking effects in the bag model or in the quark model , by applying center - of - mass corrections @xcite , or by including one - gluon exchange interactions @xcite or both @xcite .",
    "the size of the corrections depends on the model and assumptions used to describe the symmetry breaking effects and on the ` existing ' data to be fitted .",
    "some authors used their own data and concluded @xcite that there is no signal for the breakdown of cabbibo s su(3 ) symmetric description . according to ref.@xcite , however , an overall fit to the existing data using broken su(3 ) scheme is better than that from the assumption of perfect su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "another approach , using the chiral effective lagrangian for baryons , @xcite calculated su(3 ) symmetry breaking corrections to axial currents of the baryon octet arising from meson loops .",
    "the size of corrections was found to be surprisingly large ( the loop correction is almost as large as the lowest order result ) which should already have raised suspicion . in a subsequent paper @xcite ,",
    "including the spin-3/2 baryon decuplet in the intermediate state , the meson loop correction to the axial currents is significantly reduced but still substantial ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , corrections due to higher baryon resonances , which in principle should be included in the intermediate states , have been ignored in the calculation and may change the result still further .",
    "thus it appears that the validity of cabbibo s su(3 ) symmetric description is far from settled .",
    "most recently , instead of model - dependent calculations , an approach @xcite based on phenomenological analysis of hyperon beta decay data has been suggested to estimate the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the authors present evidence for a strong variation of the @xmath0 parameter between various transitions .    in section ii",
    ", we consider another approach based on a general discussion @xcite of su(3 ) flavor symmetry and its possible breaking and show that the hyperon beta decay data are adequately represented by at most a small deviation from of cabibbo s su(3 ) symmetric description , which can be well accommodated within the framework of the usual assumption of a small su(3 ) breaking proportional to the mass - difference between strange and nonstrange quarks . in section iii , the consequences for the quark spin distribution in the nucleon are discussed .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "in the quark model , which provides an explicit realization of cabibbo s theory connecting strangeness - conserving and strangeness - changing weak interactions , the primary weak current responsible for transitions between hadrons is : @xmath10 with @xmath11{\\rm cos}{\\theta_c } + [ \\lambda_4 + i\\lambda_5]{\\rm sin}{\\theta_c}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 ( i=1,2, ... 8 ) denote the gell - mann matrices and @xmath13 represents the triplet ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) of basic quark fields .",
    "eq.(1 ) requires that weak transition - elements necessarily transform as a component of an su(3 ) octet . if baryons are assigned to a su(3 ) octet , represented in matrix form by : @xmath17 the su(3)-octet matrix elements between baryons can be written , in the symmetric limit ( we are concerned only with the values for @xmath18 , i.e. zero four - momentum transfer ) , as @xmath19_- ) \\eqno ( 3)\\ ] ] which can also be written as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , the su(3 ) flavor symmetry is only approximate for strangeness - changing processes .",
    "if su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effects can not be ignored , the expressions for the matrix - elements must be generalized .",
    "we assume that the breaking of su(3)-flavor symmetry is due to a term which transforms like the eighth generator of su(3 )",
    ". this would be the case , for example , if su(3 ) breaking arose entirely from a mass - difference between strange and ( degenerate @xcite ) non - strange quarks .",
    "to first order in the symmetry - breaking interaction , transforming like @xmath23 , the most general su(3 ) structure of the weak matrix - elements between baryons can be written as @xmath24 @xmath25/2 \\eqno ( 4)\\ ] ] where the first two terms are the ones given in eq.(3 ) and the others are su(3 ) symmetry - breaking corrections .",
    "the corresponding symmetry - breaking parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 , and @xmath28 should be small relative to @xmath29 and @xmath30 for such a perturbative expansion to be valid .",
    "vector coupling constants are not affected to first order @xcite .",
    "for the ratio of axial - vector to vector amplitudes , eq.(4 ) yields @xcite @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where we have listed only those transitions for which these ratios are relatively well measured @xcite : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 let us first discuss the su(3 ) symmetry scheme .",
    "fig.1 exhibits the results reported in eqs.(9)@xmath39(12 ) under the assumption that su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effects are negligible , viz .",
    "all breaking parameters are zero : @xmath40 in eqs .",
    "( 5)@xmath39(8 ) .",
    "we see that the @xmath41 ratios for the best - measured transitions ( 9)-(11 ) yield , within the errors , a unique solution for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . while the line corresponding to the central value of @xmath41 for the less accurately measured @xmath42 transition does not pass exactly through the same @xmath43 point , a downward shift of @xmath44 by an amount equal to the quoted error , is sufficient to bring it into agreement with the others .",
    "hence it seems that no significant su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effect is needed to describe the existing @xmath41 data .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the favored solution for @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained from data ( 9)@xmath39(11 ) is not too different from that predicted by the static su(6 ) symmetric model with suitable relativistic recoil corrections ( @xmath45 25@xmath46 reduction@xcite ) .    while there does not seem to be any compelling evidence demanding the inclusion of su(3 ) breaking effects",
    ", it may be worthwhile to see what is obtained if one takes the data , eqs.(9)-(12 ) , at face value and seeks a solution allowing any one of the symmetry breaking parameters in eq.(4 ) to be non - zero .",
    "we search in the three - dimensional space @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath47 ( where @xmath47 denotes one of four possible small symmetry breaking parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 or @xmath28 ) to find the minimum of the quantity @xmath48 .",

    "the best fits under the assumption that su(3 ) symmetry breaking arises from terms of the type @xmath26 or @xmath27 , yield values which , in view of the quoted errors , are indistinguishable from zero , i.e. do not call for any correction at all .",

    "similar discussion can be carried out for @xmath26- , @xmath27- and @xmath15-type solutions .",
    "it may be noted that all su(3 ) symmetry - breaking parameters considered in this paper are significantly smaller than the su(3 ) symmetric parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 . compared to the result given in @xcite , our @xmath0 value for a given symmetry breaking",
    "parameter set is unique for the known baryon decay modes .",
    "it suggests that the entire pattern of existing hyperon semileptonic decay data can be very well described in a framework which is basically su(3 ) flavor symmetry with small su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effects .",
    "therefore no evidence of @xmath54 violation for su(3 ) symmetry in hyperon beta decay data can be found .",

    "it should be noted that the anomalous gluon contributions @xcite and higher twist effects @xcite are not included in ( 15 ) .",
    "the former is still a subject of debate and the latter is expected to be only a small correction at the low @xmath61 value ( for example , the e142 @xmath62 data ) . combining ( 15 ) and the following two relations @xmath63 @xmath64 one obtains @xmath65   + { { c_s}\\over 9}\\delta \\sigma   \\eqno ( 18)\\ ] ] hence the data @xmath66 and @xmath67 deduced from @xmath68 depend on @xmath0 value used as input in ( 18 ) .    using @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 the emc data @xcite @xmath72 led to @xmath73 however , if instead , using @xmath74 and the same @xmath75 and @xmath76 as used in the emc analysis @xcite , one obtains @xmath77 one can see that by using a smaller @xmath78 value , @xmath66 increases and the magnitude of @xmath67 decreases . however , in contrast to the change of @xmath67 , the total quark helicity @xmath66 is not sensitive to @xmath78 .",
