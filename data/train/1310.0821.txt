    "active star formation in other galaxies can be inferred from several indicators of the presence of short - lived massive stars , including strong uv flux and h@xmath11 emission from excited hydrogen gas .",
    "although these massive stars dominate the observable emission , they represent only a tiny fraction of the total stellar mass being formed ; the majority of this is contained in much more numerous low mass stars .",
    "empirical relations , such as the kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite have matched the observed surface density of total rate of star formation to the surface density of gas in other galaxies .",
    "recent detailed studies of nearby galactic star forming regions obtained a complete census of the young stellar content and found star formation rates orders of magnitude higher than predicted by these empirical relations @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the dense gas most relevant to the star formation process appears diluted in extragalactic observations due to the more abundant diffuse clouds .",
    "in contrast , the spatial resolution in galactic star forming regions is sufficient for the the dense gas to fill the beam @xcite .",
    "another important difference between the nearby , well - studied star forming regions and star forming regions observed in other galaxies is that the nearby regions are primarily forming low mass stars .",
    "due to the feedback between massive stars and their environments , it is important to also study massive galactic regions analogous to the star forming regions seen in other galaxies that are near enough to obtain an accurate census of star formation activity from high mass stars to below 1 m@xmath12 .",
    "one such galactic region is ngc 6334 , or the cat s paw nebula .",
    "the current understanding of ngc 6334 is well - summarized in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "ngc 6334 is a large ( m @xmath13 10@xmath14 m@xmath15 ) molecular cloud complex located at @xmath16 .",
    "ob stars have been detected both in clusters and isolated throughout the entire molecular cloud complex , with a recent ubvr survey turning up 150 ob stars @xcite .",
    "the central portion of the cloud consists of a dense dusty ridge extending approximately 10 pc parallel to the galactic plane hosting multiple sites of massive star formation .",
    "historically different nomenclature has been used to describe the brightest radio and far - infrared sources in this region .",
    "we are using the a , c , d , e , and f radio source labels from @xcite , the roman numberal i , ii , iii , iv and v fir source names from @xcite and the i(n ) reference from @xcite .",
    "sources that are detected in both the radio and far - infrared continuum we will refer to by both designations , e.g. ngc 6334 i / f . the main features of ngc 6334 are shown in figure [ fig : ngc6334label ] .",
    "ngc 6334 i(n ) and i / f are among the farthest north in the ridge and are also extremely young .",
    "i(n ) , a deeply embedded protocluster of massive stars , has recently been studied extensively with observatories such as herschel and the sub - millimeter array ( sma)@xcite . just to the south is ngc 6334 ii / d , a small well - defined hii region .",
    "ngc 6334 v is another young far - infrared source which is driving a massive molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "ngc 6334 iii / c and ngc 6334 iv /",
    "a are also joint far - infrared and radio sources , each surrounding a late o - type star and having @xmath17 .",
    "this diversity of environments within ngc 6334 provides a unique laboratory to study massive star formation at all stages of pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "in addition , as ngc 6334 is one of the closest sites of massive star formation to the sun ( @xmath18 kpc , @xcite ) , we are also able to characterize the large population of low mass stars the cloud is producing . prior to this work , there have been no deep , extensive near- and mid- infrared surveys covering the entire ngc 6334 star forming complex in a systematic way .",
    "shallow observations in the mid - infrared include the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( _ glimpse _ , @xcite ) and the mips inner galactic plane survey ( mipsgal , @xcite ) programs using the infrared array camera @xcite and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , @xcite ) onboard the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "deep ground - based near - infrared observations have targeted small portions of the cloud , e.g. @xcite , and shallow low resolution studies of the whole cloud have also been completed ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of new deep observations with spitzer irac as well as a large deep survey of the entire star forming region in the near infrared with the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) extremely widefield infrared imager ( newfirm ) camera @xcite on the blanco 4 m telescope at ctio .",
    "we also incorporate our analysis of the publicly available 24 @xmath3 m data from the mipsgal survey program .",
    "in this comprehensive study we have obtained a census of the young stellar population of this massive and complex region extending from the high mass protostars to below @xmath19 .",
    "we identify the sources based on the morphology of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "sources that have a rising spectrum toward long wavelengths are identified as class i young stellar objects ( ysos ) and sources that have a flatter , or negative slope toward longer wavelengths are identified as class ii ysos .    combined with our precise mapping of extinction in the region , we have extended the empirical relations between gas surface density and star formation rate to a broader range of masses .",
    "this is the first paper of a series in which we will examine star formation efficiency in 5 other massive galactic star forming regions that we have also observed with spitzer and newfirm .    in section  [ sec : obs ] of this paper , we describe our observations and in section  [ sec : daophot ] we present our methodology for the data reduction and photometry . in section  [ sec : ysoid ]",
    "we present our method to identify the candidate young stellar object ( yso ) population , and in section  [ sec : discussion ] we delve into the derived properties of the star formation activity in ngc 6334 .",

    "the cloud is observed in its entirety with our near - ir ( newfirm ) and mid - ir ( irac ) data .",
    "archival observations from the mipsgal survey cover all but the northwest portion of the cloud .",
    "approximately 0.8 square degrees were observed from @xmath0 band to 8.0 @xmath3 m .",
    "we observed a 1.2 by 0.9 region covering ngc 6334 ( shown in figure  [ fig : iracrgb ] ) using irac during spitzer s cryogenic mission on 2008 september 21 ( pid 30154 ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath3 m .",
    "we mapped the region with a grid of 13 by 11 tiles in 2 epochs spaced by 6 hours with 3 dither positions per tile per epoch .",
    "the two epochs were intented to be scheduled 6 months apart ( to allow variability studies ) but were then executed back to back to ensure completion of the dataset before exhaustion of the cryogen .",
    "the region observed corresponds to approximately 33 by 25 parsecs at a distance of 1.6 kpc .",
    "we used irac s 12 s frame time high dynamic range ( hdr ) mode , acquiring consecutive individual observations with exposure times of 0.4 and 10.4 seconds .",
    "the long exposures probe the faint stellar population in the cloud while the addition of the short exposure observations allow for the recovery of bright sources that are saturated in the long exposure frames .",
    "due to the short interval between the two epochs , both epochs were combined to produce the final mosaics .",
    "the 858 individual basically calibrated frames ( bcd , processed with the spitzer irac pipeline version s18.7.0 ) for each exposure time were mosaicked together using the iracproc package @xcite to perform outlier rejection and bad pixel masking .",
    "iracproc is a pdl wrapper script for the standard spitzer science center mosaicing software mopex @xcite which has been enhanced for better cosmic ray rejection .",
    "each mosaic was re - sampled from the native irac resolution of 1.22 per pixel to 0.86267 per pixel and projected onto a common world coordinate system grid .",
    "the final mosaics combined a median of 6 dither positions per pixel for an effective integration time of 62.4 seconds per pixel in each long exposure mosaic and 2.4 seconds in the short exposure mosaic .",
    "the bright nebular emission along the central ridge of ngc 6334 severely saturated the central portion of the long exposure mosaic at 8.0 @xmath3 m but remains unsaturated in the short exposure mosaic .",
    "we also retrieved the archival mipsgal 24 @xmath3 m observations of ngc 6334 obtained as part of the mipsgal survey .",
    "the central ridge running from the northeast to the southwest of ngc 6334 is saturated in the mipsgal 24 @xmath3 m images .",
    "the available observations of ngc6334 span across two mipsgal mosaics , shown combined in figure  [ fig : allrgb ] .",
    "the upper northwest corner of ngc 6334 ( @xmath20 ) was not covered by the mipsgal survey .",
    "full details of the mipsgal observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the psf of the 24 @xmath3 m mosaics is  6 fwhm , and the median exposure per pixel in these mipsgal mosaics was 30 s.      figure  [ fig : newfirmrgb ] shows our near - ir images of ngc 6334 acquired with the newfirm camera on the blanco 4 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) during the 2010a semester between 2010 may 24 and 2010 may 30 .",
    "the newfirm camera , designed to quickly map large areas of the sky , contains 4 insb 2048 @xmath21 2048 pixel arrays arranged in a 2 @xmath21 2 pattern with a 28 field of view and an approximately 1 gap between the ccds .",
    "the detector has a pixel scale of 0.4 per pixel .    to match the 1.2 by 0.9 sky coverage of our irac mosaics",
    ", we used a 2 by 2 central pointing mapping routine to divide ngc 6334 into four quadrants plus an overlapping central region .",
    "our observations were taken with a random dither offset large enough to fill in the 1 gap between ccds .",
    "for each quadrant we took 60 second exposures at 11 dither positions .",
    "each dither position was a combination of multiple co - added exposures to achieve longer exposure times while avoiding the non - linear regime of the detector . for the @xmath0 band we used two co - added 30 second exposures , for the @xmath1 band we used three co -",
    "added 20 second exposures , and for the @xmath2 band we used six co - added 10 second exposures . in the central pointing , the @xmath0 band image used 20 second exposures and 3 co - adds , and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands used a slightly shallower 4 second exposures and 8 co - adds .",
    "the sky background was measured by taking 3 dithered sky observations 2 off field .",
    "standard processing of dark frame subtraction , flat fielding , sky - subtraction and bad pixel masking was performed by the newfirm science pipeline @xcite to produce 5 stacked composite images for each near - infrared band .",
    "the final stacked images retain the detector pixel scale of 0.4 per pixel .",
    "variable seeing conditions caused the final observed point source fwhm in the stacked images to range from approximately 0.9 to 1.5 .",
    "the @xmath1 band observations were taken during the best seeing conditions and have the smallest fwhm , and the @xmath2 images have the largest fwhm . even in the most crowded portions of",
    "the region observed , however , the difference in effective resolution at the different newfirm bands has a minimal effect on later source - matching .",
    "we used daophot @xcite to perform psf - fitting photometry in each final mosaic individually ; the long and short exposure mosaics for each of the 4 irac bands , the 5 pointings per band from newfirm , and the 2 available mipsgal 24 @xmath3 m mosaics .",
    "the psf for each image was derived from a minimum of 10 bright , unsaturated , and relatively isolated stars that are well separated from the extended nebular emission .",
    "the psf obtained for the short - exposure irac frames was also used for the corresponding long exposure mosaic .",
    "the instrumental psf was defined in a 24.4 @xmath21 24.4 box ( 20@xmath2120 irac native pixels ) chosen to be approximately 10 times larger than the observed fwhm of an individual point source and therefore include the vast majority of the flux of a point source .    due to the crowded galactic field at ngc 6334 s latitude ( @xmath22 ) , even in the short exposure",
    "mosaics most of the bright sources are surrounded by other point sources within the 24.4 box used to define the psf .",
    "if left alone , the flux from these nearby point sources will skew the derived psf and introduce additional systematic error into the photometry .",
    "we utilized a multiple - iteration method to converge on a satisfactory psf for each frame .",
    "we began with a psf composed purely of an analytical lorentz function and used it to subtract off the neighboring sources from each of the 10 or more selected psf stars .",
    "the source - subtracted image was then re - examined , and the psf re - derived , allowing corrections to the analytic function based on the observed shape of the psf .",
    "we progressed through four total iterations of fitting and subtracting the neighboring sources and then redefining the psf from the psf stars in the neighbor - subtracted frames .",
    "the high variability of the background nebular emission at irac wavelengths over small spatial scales proved challenging for a single point source detection threshold to be used across the entire mosaic .",
    "to better enable the detection of all faint point sources regardless of position in the mosaic , we used a multiple - iteration background subtraction method similar to the procedure in @xcite .",
    "we first used the photometry for the preliminary source list to subtract all point sources from each frame .",
    "the source - subtracted image was then median filtered with a 51 @xmath21 51 pixel box to produce an image of the background emission .",
    "this background image was then subtracted from the original mosaic .",
    "the background subtracted mosaics were then used to refine the location of the point sources and identify the ones that were lost in the background diffuse emission . for our newfirm images ,",
    "the variability of the sky background was low enough that we did not need to use the background subtraction method to achieve comparable completeness .",
    "the resulting source list was fed into daophot s _ allstar _ routine to psf - fit each source . to reduce the effect of crowding , only the flux within a 3 pixel radius was used to fit the model psf , corresponding to 2.6 in the irac images and 1.2 in the newfirm images .",
    "detected sources which deviate from the expected point source shape by more than @xmath23 were rejected .",
    "the majority of rejected sources were spurious detections along the extended emission , although they also can indicate partially resolved background galaxies as well as blended psfs from pairs of stars with extremely small angular separation .",
    "an example of the residuals left after subtracting the derived psf for a representative crowded field can be seen in figure  [ fig : sourcesubtraction ] .",
    "we ran the subtracted mosaics through daophot for two subsequent passes to find point sources that were missed during the first pass .",
    "occasionally when running a second or third iteration , the daophot _ find _ algorithm would detect bright pixels in the residuals of subtracted sources as a new legitimate point source . in all bands , any source detected in the second or third photometry iteration that had a centroid position matching within less than 2 ( approximately the mean fwhm of the irac point sources ) of a source from a previous iteration was considered a duplicate detection .",
    "the duplicate sources identified in this way were rejected from further analysis .",
    "sources brighter than magnitude 9.2 are saturated in the long exposure mosaic at 3.6 @xmath3 m .",
    "the saturation limit is 9.0 , 6.5 and 6.5 magnitudes for 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m respectively . where a source in the long exposure mosaic frame matched within 2.0 of a source with a short exposure magnitude brighter than the saturation limit",
    ", the short exposure photometry was used .",
    "the same method described above was used to compile a preliminary source list for each of the five images for the three near - infrared bands , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . in each photometric band , the newfirm pointings overlapped by approximately 3 , causing many sources to be detected in more than one newfirm stacked image .",
    "sources with centroid positions matching within 0.8 in different stacked images were combined ; we retained the average magnitude weighted by the exposure time contributing to that source in each stacked image .",
    "point sources detected in 2 or fewer stacked images ( out of the maximum possible 11 for each mosaic ) were rejected as being likely artifacts left over after pipeline processing . as a result ,",
    "120 seconds is the minimum exposure time for each newfirm source included in the point source catalog .",
    "the median point source exposure time was 600 seconds for @xmath0 and @xmath2 band and 480 seconds for @xmath1 band .",
    "we also applied the same photometry process to the mipsgal 24 @xmath3 m mosaics .",
    "similar to the 8.0 @xmath3 m mosaics from irac , the _ find _ algorithm identified many small bright areas along the extended emission as point sources .",
    "larger restrictions were placed on the daophot psf - fitting parameters of detected 24 @xmath3 m point sources to decrease the number of spurious detections . after these cuts 991 point sources in the mipsgal mosaics have a centroid matching within 1 of an irac / newfirm source .",
    "due to the issues with saturation , there is a large difference in the completeness of the mips portion of the source catalog across the region .",
    "we used the short exposure mosaic to calibrate the instrumental psf photometry in each irac band against 100 relatively isolated and bright stars measured with aperture photometry in photvis @xcite .",
    "the same procedure was used to calibrate the 24 @xmath3 m photometry . to determine the zero point for our near - infrared photometry , we matched up bright isolated stars from our newfirm catalogs with sources from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) source list . in the higher source - density portions of the field",
    "the 2mass photometry suffers more from crowding and blending due to the lower survey resolution ( 2.4vs .",
    "0.9 ) , leading to a larger number of sources with artificially bright magnitudes . to decrease the flux contamination effect from this crowding",
    ", sources for the near - infrared photometric calibration were carefully chosen from uncrowded portions of the mosaics .",
    "we created the final source list catalog by spatially matching the detected sources across the different bands .",
    "we first matched sources detected with the same instrument , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for newfirm and 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath3 m for irac .",
    "our cross - band correlation method first calculates whether there is an overall systematic shift in source centroid positions between the input frames , and then looks for sources with shifted centroid positions matching between bands .",
    "the newfirm sources were matched if their centroid positions differed by less than 0.8 .",
    "for irac , due to the larger pixel scale and broader fwhm , we required sources to have centroids that matched within 1.0 between bands . to combine the two catalogs together",
    ", we used the larger 1.0 matching criterion .",
    "to further increase reliability of our point source catalog , we first required simultaneous detection in 2 adjacent bands ( e.g. @xmath1 and @xmath2 on newfirm , or 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath3 m with irac ) . following",
    "that , we also included sources at the edges of the irac mosaics only visible at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath3 m or at 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath3 m bands .",
    "finally , due to the large number of very red sources in the field , we also retained photometry for approximately 7,000 @xmath2 band sources lacking detection at @xmath0 or @xmath1 but that matched within 0.5 with a source detected in 2 or more adjacent irac bands .",
    "histograms of all sources kept for the ngc 6334 point source catalog are presented in figure  [ fig : sourcehist1 ] .",
    "the completeness limit for each band was estimated from the turnover point in each histogram and the limiting magnitude reported is the faintest source detected at 5@xmath24 level or higher ( a maximum photometric error of 0.217 magnitudes ) .",
    "sample entries of the ngc 6334 point source catalog can be seen in table  [ tab : pscsamp ] .",
    "the full version is available in electronic format .",
    "a statistical summary of the point source catalog can be found in table  [ tab : catsumfull ] .",
    "observational methods of identifying ysos have been derived from evolutionary models and comparison to observed known ysos .",
    "one early method was to fit the slope @xmath11 of log(@xmath25f@xmath26 ) vs. log(@xmath25 ) between 2 and 24 @xmath3 m @xcite .",
    "other methods have referenced color selection criteria for yso stars , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we used the full range of observed wavelengths from @xmath0 band to 24 @xmath3 m for the purpose of identifying yso candidates in our point source catalog .",
    "the selection is based on color and magnitude criteria , similar to those defined in @xcite .",
    "we have however adapted these selection criteria to take into account the greater distance of ngc 6334 and the higher level of contamination due to crowding .",
    "furthermore , we have developed and validated new criteria designed to allow selection using only near - ir and warm spitzer bands ( 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "these new criteria are important for our follow - up programs on other high mass star - forming regions that have been observed after spitzer s liquid helium cryogen supply was exhausted as well as for other massive regions where existing 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m irac observations are compromised by saturation from the very strong pah extended emission .    to identify the ysos in ngc 6334 we have first applied the original @xcite criteria to sources with detection at all four irac bands , then applied our newly developed criteria to the combined near- and mid - ir point source catalog . as a comparison",
    ", we then compare the results of these yso identification methods to the classification devised by fitting a power law to the sed between 2 and 24 @xmath3 m .      the first stage of our yso identification followed the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method looks at a variety of color - color and color - magnitude relations for sources detected in all 4 irac bands .",
    "first , this method identifies non - ysos which share some similar color spaces to ysos and that could contaminate the final source statistics if not removed .",
    "these possible contaminants include active galactic nuclei , quasars , resolved knots of shocked gas emission , and faint stellar point sources where the longer wavelength photometry is contaminated by pah emission , which is a particularly common cause of contamination in this massive star forming region .",
    "we applied this classification scheme to the approximately 80,000 point sources in our catalog with 5@xmath24 detection at all 4 irac bands .",
    "we found that 10,327 sources were likely background galaxies , 41 sources were likely knots of shocked gas emission , and 13,791 sources were identified as faint sources with pah contaminated apertures at long wavelengths .",
    "after the decontamination process we were left with 260 sources matching the color selection criteria for class i ysos , and 915 sources were identified as class ii ysos .",
    "the application of each step of the full gutermuth contaminant object identification criteria is shown in figure  [ fig : irac4bandcont ] and the identified ysos are shown in figure  [ fig : irac4bandyso ] .",
    "the sed of a yso is characterized by excess emission above expected photospheric levels in the infrared , increasing towards longer wavelengths through the near- and mid - infrared . however , in regions where massive star formation is ongoing , the extreme levels of ionizing radiation from the massive o and b stars excites widespread emission from pah compounds embedded within the dust clouds .",
    "this extended emission dominates the observed emission at irac s 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m bands , drowning out the individual point sources nestled within these structures and saturating the detector in even modestly long integration times . for our second stage of our yso selection process",
    "we identified additional yso sources that lacked detection at 5.8 or 8.0 microns and were thus missed by the @xcite criteria .",
    "we used the combined newfirm and irac near - infrared catalogs for the over 260,000 sources detected at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , 3.6 @xmath3 m and 4.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "as mentioned before , these same criteria are also suitable for yso selection in fields observed during the spitzer warm mission .    for this stage",
    "we first identified the locus of main sequence stars ( assuming an average spectral type of k0 ) in the @xmath27 $ ] vs. @xmath28 - [ 4.5]$ ] and @xmath29 vs. @xmath30 $ ] color spaces subjected to interstellar reddening .",
    "we adopted the parameter @xmath31 , defined as the maximum error in color for two sources each having the maximum catalog cut - off photometric error of 0.217 magnitudes ( @xmath32 ) , or @xmath33 .",
    "sources falling within @xmath31 of the main sequence reddening vector were considered to be reddened field stars .",

    "the class ii sources are also strongly clustered , although a larger number of them are found further from the filamentary structure of ngc 6334 .",
    "although some additional spread in class ii location may be expected due to their expected more advanced age , this may also be an indication of the higher contamination fraction present in the class ii population .",
    "overall , the near - infrared cuts are somewhat more restrictive than the selection requiring 4 irac bands .",

    "we have not attempted a detailed characterization of the class iii / pre - main sequence population in this work due to the difficulty inherent in distinguishing a small physical infrared excess from the scatter due to photometric error and matching between different beam sizes in this crowded field .    due to the slight differences in the near - infrared and irac 4 bands yso identification methods in the overlapping @xmath39 @xmath3 m region , there is some mismatching between classification schemes .",

    "the suggested criteria for a `` mini - starburst '' are : @xmath103 10 - 100 @xmath63 myr@xmath8 @xmath104 and @xmath105 @xcite . in the irdc",
    "g035.39 - 00.33 these conditions are met over an approximately 8 pc@xmath106 region , comparable in size to the dense ridge in ngc 6334 .",
    "these conditions are found on a wider scale in the massive galactic star forming region w43 located at the intersection of the galactic bar and the scutum - centaurus arm .",
    "the ( conservative ) estimate @xmath77 for the global star formation rate we present in ngc 6334 is approaching the limit defining mini - starburst conditions .",
    "these conditions are fully met when we confine ourselves to the class i ysos located within @xmath80 , where we also expect the efficiency to increase as has been found in other star forming regions @xcite .",
    "this suggests ngc 6334 may also belong to the `` mini - starburst '' class of star forming regions .",
    "ngc 6334 does not appear to have any special galactic location to explain the abundance of dense gas and the subsequent extreme star formation activity taking place within this region .",
    "low - resolution observations of transitions of co , @xmath107co , cs , and nh@xmath108 found a @xmath109 km s@xmath8 velocity gradient along the main ridge indicative of a dynamic process such as large scale infall @xcite .",
    "a large scale infall or dynamic merger of multiple filamentary structures could help explain the origin of the high fraction of dense molecular gas in ngc 6334 , and in turn the high star formation activity .",
    "recent work attributes the velocity gradient along this ridge to global graviational collapse of the ngc 6334 molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : exgalcontext ] compares ngc 6334 to other galactic star forming regions observed by spitzer during the gould belt survey ( gbs , @xcite ) , the molecular cores to planet - forming disks project ( c2d,@xcite ) , and the prototypical `` mini - starburst '' regions w43 and g035 from @xcite .",
    "the range shown for ngc 6334 reflects the uncertainty in both the mass of the total cloud and the total age and mass of the yso population .",
    "ngc 6334 falls between the low mass galactic star forming regions at the lower left and the galactic `` mini - starburst '' regions at the upper right .",
    "the location of ngc 6334 and the galactic `` mini - starburst '' regions makes it unlikely that the vertical offset between the galactic star forming regions and other galaxies in the kennicutt - schmidt diagram is due to fundamental differences between regions that are forming high and low mass stars .",
    "instead , the high star formation rate found in ngc 6334 supports that the primary predictor of a high star formation rate is a large amount of dense gas , as suggested in e.g. @xcite and @xcite , with different dependencies on the density of the star forming gas . in a typical galaxy ,",
    "the total gas mass is diluted and only a small fraction is found in molecular clouds dense enough to participate in star formation activity .",
    "we have obtained deep observations of ngc 6334 in the near- and mid - infrared , cataloging @xmath4 galactic point sources in a @xmath110 deg@xmath48 region . based on their near- and mid - infrared colors ,",
    "2283 of these have been identified as class i or class ii ysos belonging to the ngc 6334 star forming complex .",
    "overall the observed yso population is found to be complete to just below 1 @xmath63 .",
    "we have modified existing yso identification schemes in order to identify the population of ysos in other star forming regions where long wavelength irac data is not available , as well as estimate the contamination , completeness , and reliability of those measurements .",
    "the full point source catalog was used to map the extinction across ngc 6334 to estimate the region s mass and from that the efficiency of star formation .",
    "the 0.8 deg@xmath48 area used to derive the yso catalog corresponds to approximately 600 pc@xmath54 at a distance of 1.6 kpc . over this wide - field view of ngc 6334",
    ", we find that the average star formation rate surface density is @xmath77 @xmath7 myr@xmath8 pc@xmath9 .    by fitting the observed ysos with a kroupa imf we can extrapolate down to the hydrogen - burning limit to account for the rest of the stellar mass that still remains below the observation detection threshold . combining this with the estimated pre - main sequence population from @xcite places the current global efficiency of star formation in ngc 6334 at @xmath84 based on a cloud mass of @xmath83  @xmath63 .",
    "the conservative estimate for the star formation rate is @xmath77 @xmath63 myr@xmath8 pc@xmath9 or  @xmath76  @xmath63  myr@xmath8 .",
    "our method assumes the detection of a complete sample of ysos down to the sensitiviy limits of our survey . the true values for the star formation rate may in fact lie closer to , or even above , the upper limits we report based on the uncertainties in the method of converting an incomplete yso count into a mass determination .    from the estimated mass in class i ysos",
    ", we find the current rate of star formation in ngc 6334 is 13.0@xmath111 @xmath7 myr@xmath8 pc@xmath9 in the dense star - forming gas within the @xmath80 contour .",
    "the high efficiency and rate of star formation in ngc 6334 indicates that this region may be undergoing a burst of star forming activity , possibly characterized as a @xmath112mini - starburst@xmath112 event .",
    "the methods of data reduction and yso identification we have derived here will be applied to a sample of 5 other massive galactic star forming complexes observed in a similar fashion with spitzer irac and newfirm .",
    "this combined sample will add to the statistical set of galactic regions with a resolved yso population characterizing both the high and low ranges of stellar mass .",
    "these regions can in turn be be directly compared to the kennicutt - schmidt relation to assist in bridging the gap between extragalactic star formation and nearby star forming regions .",

    "<S> the heavy concentration of protostars along the dense filamentary structures indicates that ngc 6334 may be undergoing a `` mini - starburst '' event with @xmath6 @xmath7 myr@xmath8 pc@xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used these estimates to place ngc 6334 in the kennicutt - schmidt diagram to help bridge the gap between observations of local low - mass star forming regions and star formation in other galaxies . </S>"
