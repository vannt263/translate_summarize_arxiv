    "there appears to be less experimental work on aggregation , but coalescence of suspended water droplets is clearly very important in the formation of rain drops in clouds @xcite . even less is known about aggregation . in particular",
    "it is not clear when a model of particles suspended in a random flow can exhibit aggregation , and when additional physical phenomena ( such as differential drift velocities under gravitational forces , or brownian diffusion ) must be invoked .",

    "the aggregation ( as opposed to clustering ) of particles by random flows has received relatively little attention .",
    "@xcite appears to have been the first to propose that particles subjected to a smooth random flow can coalesce , and showed numerical evidence that this can happen in one dimension .",
    "he argued that there is a transition between coalescing and non - coalescing phases , and identified the dimensionless parameter which determines the phase transition in one dimension .",
    "this paper describes results obtained from a new approach to characterising particle aggregation in random flows .",
    "it is based upon calculating a lyapunov exponent describing the rate of separation of nearby particles from a solution of a system of stochastic differential equations : the lyapunov exponent is the expectation value of one of the variables . in the limit",
    "as the correlation time of the flow approaches zero , the stochastic differential equations can be reduced to a pair of langevin equations . our results for three - dimensional flows which are discussed here build upon earlier work by two of the present authors in one dimension @xcite ( where we solved deutsch s model exactly ) and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional case is most important for physical applications , but involves substantial additional technical complications .",
    "we remark that @xcite also considered the two - dimensional case , and quotes an analytic expression for the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "his expression is incorrect in two dimensions , because the generating function that he uses is divergent for the equilibrium distribution .",
    "his calculation can be adapted to give the correct expression in the one dimensional case , as quoted in @xcite .",
    "the definition of lyapunov exponents is explained by @xcite , who also discuss the method we use for extracting the lyapunov exponents from direct numerical simulations .",
    "we note that in the case where inertia of the particles can be neglected , our results reduce to calculating the lyapunov exponent for a spatially correlated brownian motion , which was discussed from a mathematical point of view by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ 1.2 the model _",
    "the most natural model for theoretical investigation is the motion of spherical particles ( radius @xmath3 , mass @xmath4 ) moving in a random velocity field @xmath5 with specified isotropic and homogeneous statistical properties .",
    "the particles are assumed not to affect either the flow , or each other s motion , and to experience a drag force given by stokes s law : the force @xmath6 on a particle moving with velocity @xmath7 relative to the fluid is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "we will simplify the problem by assuming that the particles are made of a material which is much denser than the fluid in which they are suspended : this enables us to neglect the inertia of the displaced fluid .",
    "accordingly , we consider a large number of suspended particles , initially with random positions and zero velocity , having equations of motion @xmath10\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the random velocity field @xmath5 could be either externally imposed ( for example , if a gas is driven by an ultrasonic noise source ) , or self - generated ( as in the case of turbulence ) .",
    "the equations of motion with displaced mass effects included are discussed by @xcite .",
    "our neglect of displaced mass effects is justified for aerosol systems .    in order to fully specify the problem",
    "we must define the statistical properties of the random velocity field @xmath5 .",
    "the random force @xmath11 is generated from a vector potential @xmath12 and a scalar potential @xmath13 : @xmath14 the scalar fields @xmath15 have isotropic , homogeneous and stationary statistics .",
    "we assume that these fields are statistically independent , and that they all have the same correlation function , except that the intensity of @xmath13 exceeds that of the other fields by a factor @xmath16 : @xmath17 c(\\vert{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'\\vert , t - t ' ) \\ .\\ ] ] the random force @xmath18 is characterised by its typical magnitude @xmath19 , and by the correlation length @xmath20 and correlation time @xmath21 of the correlation function @xmath22 .",
    "in the case of a well - developed turbulent flow , the velocity field has a power - law spectrum with upper and lower cutoffs @xcite . if a random velocity field modeling fully - developed turbulence is used in our model , it is most appropriate to take the correlation length and time to be those of the dissipation scale , that is , the cutoff with the smaller length scale .",
    "the system of equations is characterised by three independent dimensionless parameters , which we take as @xmath23 the parameter @xmath24 is a dimensionless measure of the degree of damping , @xmath25 is a dimensionless measure of the strength of the forcing term and @xmath26 measures the relative magnitudes of potential and solenoidal components of the velocity field ( which is purely potential when @xmath27 , and purely solenoidal in the limit as @xmath28 ) .          _",
    "1.3 description of our results _",
    "we show that the phase transition is determined by a lyapunov exponent , @xmath29 , describing the separation of nearby particles : their trajectories coalesce if @xmath30 . here",
    "we describe a new and general approach to this problem , reducing the determination of the lyapunov exponent to the analysis of a simple dynamical system , described by a system of ordinary differential equations containing stochastic forcing terms : the lyapunov exponent is found to be proportional to the expectation value of one coordinate .",
    "these stochastic differential equations are derived in section [ sec : 2 ] .",
    "they introduce an apparent paradox : the structure of the equations appears to be identical in two - dimensional and three - dimensional flows , suggesting that the path - coalescence transition is fundamentally the same in two and three dimensions . that would be a very surprising conclusion .    in order to demonstrate and illuminate our method , in sections",
    "[ sec : 3 ] and [ sec : 4 ] we pursue the solution of this problem in considerable depth in one limiting case , namely the limit where the correlation time @xmath31 of the random velocity field is small and the random force is sufficiently weak ( strictly , we consider the case where @xmath32 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the system of ordinary differential equations described in section [ sec : 2 ] becomes a system of two coupled langevin equations . in section [ sec : 3 ] we show that there is in fact a difference between the three - dimensional problem and the two - dimensional case studied in @xcite , which is a rather subtle example of the difficulties in applying langevin approaches to nonlinear equations @xcite .    in section [ sec : 4 ]",
    "we discuss a perturbation theory for the lyapunov exponent describing the phase transition , expanded in powers of a parameter @xmath33 which is a dimensionless measure of the inertia of the particles .",
    "the perturbation theory is constructed by transforming the langevin equation first into a fokker - planck equation , and then into a non - hermite an perturbation of a three - dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "we are then able to use the harmonic - oscillator creation and annihilation operators @xcite to express the perturbation theory in a purely algebraic form , enabling us to compute the coefficients to any desired order .",
    "we investigate the phase diagram ( the line in parameter space separating coalescing and non - coalescing phases ) , using both monte carlo averaging of the langevin equation and the results of our perturbation theory .",
    "we find that aggregation can only occur if the random flow has a certain degree of compressibility , which increases as the effects of inertia increase , until there is no coalescing phase even for a purely potential flow field .",
    "the analysis in sections [ sec : 2 ] to [ sec : 4 ] considers the case where all of the suspended particles have the same mass @xmath4 and damping rate @xmath2 .",
    "this ideal can be approached quite accurately in model experiments , but in most applications in the natural world and in technology , the suspended particles will have different masses , sizes and shapes . in section [ sec : 5 ] we discuss the effect of dispersion in the distribution of masses in the one - dimensional case : these arguments can be adapted to treat higher dimensions and dispersion of the damping constant @xmath2 .",
    "we argue that path coalescence is not destroyed by mass dispersion ( although of course it is no longer a sharp transition ) . in this paper",
    "we give a quite comprehensive discussion of the the case where the correlation time of the random flow is very short , and the stochastic differential equations derived in section 2 can be approximated by langevin equations .",
    "section 6 discusses how our approach can be extended to other cases .",
    "to determine whether particles cluster together , we consider two nearby trajectories with spatial separation @xmath34 and momenta differing by @xmath35 .",
    "the linearised equations of motion derived from ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) are @xmath36 here @xmath37 is proportional to the strain - rate matrix of the velocity field , with elements @xmath38 it is convenient to parameterise @xmath34 and @xmath35 as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are orthogonal unit vectors , which depend upon time .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is a scale factor : trajectories coalesce if @xmath42 decreases with probability unity in the long - time limit . in the three - dimensional case , we find it convenient to introduce the third element @xmath43 of a time - dependent orthonormal basis so that @xmath44 differentiating ( [ eq : 2.2 ] ) , and substituting the resulting expressions into ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) gives @xmath45 projecting @xmath46 onto the unit vectors @xmath47 gives the following three scalar equations of motion @xmath48 the last of these equations implies that @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath41 : we write @xmath51 so that the equation for @xmath52 gives @xmath53 the first equation of ( [ eq : 2.6 ] ) indicates that @xmath42 is a product of random variables , and therefore has a log - normal distribution , that is , the logarithm of @xmath42 has a gaussian probability density . in the limit as @xmath54 ,",
    "the mean and variance of @xmath55 are both linear functions of time : @xmath56 where @xmath29 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants . if @xmath30 , the probability of @xmath55 exceeding any specified value approaches zero as @xmath54 , implying that trajectories of nearby particles almost always coalesce .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath29 is the mean value of the derivative @xmath60 , so that the first equation of ( [ eq : 2.6 ] ) gives @xmath61 now consider the three projections of @xmath62 , as given by equation ( [ eq : 2.5 ] ) : @xmath63 we introduce the notation @xmath64 and note that the statistics of the transformed matrix elements @xmath65 are the same as those of the original elements @xmath66 , because the statistics of the velocity field are isotropic .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : 2.6 ] ) to ( [ eq : 2.8 ] ) and @xmath67 to simplify , we find the following equations of motion for the variables @xmath68 @xmath69 finally , the equation for @xmath70 gives @xmath71 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : 2.9 ] ) and ( [ eq : 2.12 ] ) are the principal results of this paper .",
    "( [ eq : 2.9 ] ) shows that the lyapunov exponent ( the sign of which determines whether or not path coalescence occurs ) is given by the expectation value of a random variable @xmath72 of a simple , finite dimensional stochastic dynamical system , described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : 2.12 ] ) .",
    "this dynamical system is almost completely de - coupled from the other variables : the equations for @xmath72 and @xmath73 do not depend upon @xmath42 , and the vectors @xmath74 only enter these equations through the evaluation of the random matrix elements @xmath75 .",
    "we pointed out that statistics of these elements are independent of the orientation of the orthogonal triplet @xmath76 .",
    "in the two - dimensional case the analysis leading to ( [ eq : 2.12 ] ) proceeds along similar lines , and leads to the same pair of equations @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the equation ( [ eq : 2.13 ] ) is absent in the two - dimensional case .",
    "this suggests that the expression for the lyapunov exponent @xmath77 should be the same in two and three dimensions .",
    "this would be a surprising conclusion , but it is not obvious how it can be averted .",
    "however , it does prove to be false , as will be demonstrated in the next section for the limiting case where @xmath32 .",
    "let us now consider how to treat eqs .  ( [ eq : 2.12 ] ) in the limit where the correlation time @xmath21 of @xmath37 is very short . because the random field @xmath18 is fluctuating very rapidly , the position @xmath78 of a particle at time @xmath79 is independent of the instantaneous value of the force @xmath18 , so that the value if @xmath80 at the position of the particle is statistically indistinguishable from a random sample of the field @xmath81 .",
    "we also assume that the gradients of the fluctuating forces ( the quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 in equations ( [ eq : 2.12 ] ) ) are sufficiently small that the typical magnitude of the displacement of the variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 occurring during the correlation time @xmath21 is small compared to the typical magnitude of these variables .",
    "this condition is expressed in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath84 and @xmath85 later in this section . under these conditions of short correlation time and small amplitude , equations ( [ eq : 2.12 ] )",

    "this expectation is correct @xcite , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : 3.1 ] ) are the appropriate langevin equations . in the three - dimensional case",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that , in the three - dimensional case , @xmath73 is a non - linear function of the components of the vector @xmath91 because it is the magnitude of this vector .",

    "let us consider the integral of the stochastic forcing terms @xmath87 over a time interval @xmath92 which is long compared to @xmath21 , but short enough that the change in the variables @xmath68 occurring in time @xmath92 can be neglected .",

    "in most naturally occurring aerosols the suspended particles have different mass @xmath4 , and particles of differing sizes will also have different values of the damping coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to consider whether particles still have a tendency to coalesce even when the particles have differing values of @xmath4 and @xmath2 : we argue that the path coalescence effect is not destroyed by small mass dispersion .",

    "in this paper we described the path - coalescence transition , and showed that the transition point is determined by the change of sign of a lyapunov exponent .",

    "the statistics of @xmath75 are those of a randomly chosen static point , and the correlation time of @xmath65 will be @xmath21 .    case a2 : if the trajectory @xmath78 is moving sufficiently rapidly that its displacement in time @xmath31 is large compared to @xmath20 , then the correlation time of @xmath65 will be smaller than @xmath21 because the loss of correlations results primarily from changing the position at which @xmath297 is sampled .",
