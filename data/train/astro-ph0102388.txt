    "the time scale of variability for symbiotic stars is quite long : the orbital periods range from @xmath11 year up to several decades while rise and decay from an outburst may take anything from a few years to more than a century ( cf .",
    "kenyon 1986 ) .",
    "such long time scales tend to discourage stand - alone photometric campaigns from a single observatory , which could pay dividends only after ten or more years .",
    "most of the current photometric investigations of symbiotic stars therefore try to assemble as much as possible data from the widest set of current and archival sources .",
    "template examples are the reconstruction of the 1890 - 1996 lightcurve of yy  her by munari et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the 1885 - 1988 lightcurve of ch  cyg by mikolajewski et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . both required a huge effort in locating and measuring historical material in plate archives around the world .",
    "henden and munari ( 2000,2001 ) have so far provided accurate and extended _ ubv(ri)@xmath0 _ photometric comparison sequences around 40 symbiotic stars , intended to assist both present time photometry as well as measurement of photographic plates from historical archives .",
    "they should stimulate small observatories and/or occasional observers to obtain new data as well as to encourage those with access to old plate archives to search for valuable historical data .",
    "assembling such data ( obtained at various observatories against the same comparison sequences to minimize systematic errors ) will result in a much better understanding of the photometric evolution and therefore the physical nature of this intriguing class of interacting binaries .",
    "in this paper we present the results of digging the asiago plate archive for seven symbiotic stars : as  323 , ap  3 - 1 , cm  aql , v1413  aql (= as  338 ) , v443  her , v627  cas (= as 501 ) and v919  sgr .",
    "two schmidt telescopes were operated at asiago observatory .",
    "the smaller one ( 40/50 cm , 100 cm focal length ) collected 20417 plates from 1958 to 1992 , and the larger one ( 67/92 cm , 208 cm focal length ) 18811 plates from 1965 to 1998 .",
    "the asiago schmidt plate collection thus span 40 years .",
    "the majority of the plates match the @xmath2 band , but the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands are well represented too .    the plates are typically filed in the archive logs with the coordinates of the object to which they were aimed , that generally does not lay in the plate center ( which is instead usually the case for the guiding star ) .",
    "therefore , for a given program star , we initially selected from the archive logs the plates to inspect as if they were covering a 2@xmath72 wider area .",
    "a subsequent visual inspection of all the selected plates separated those actually containing the program star ( 602 plates ) from the others .",
    "we then proceeded to estimate at an high quality binocular microscope the magnitude of the program star against the _",
    "ubv(ri)@xmath0 _ comparison sequences calibrated by henden and munari ( 2000 ) .",
    "these comparison sequences proved to work perfectly , covering the range of variability of the program stars and with both the comparison stars and the variable visible at the same time in the eyepiece field of the microscope .",
    "the exception has been v627  cas , which was brighter than the comparison sequence in some of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 plates .",
    "we then searched outside the field explored by henden and munari ( 2000 ) for bright stars that have been found constant in brightness by hipparcos / tycho .",
    "we converted their tycho @xmath10 , @xmath11 magnitudes into johnson s standard @xmath2 and @xmath4 values , and using the transformations of caldwell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) we eventually derived their @xmath12 and @xmath13 magnitudes .",
    "these transformation relations between colors in the @xmath14 system gives accurate results _ provided _ that the stars belong to the solar neighborhood population , the reddening is not large and the luminosity class is roughly known .",
    "we have assumed all the selected tycho objects to be nearby main sequence stars .",
    "thus , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 so derived may be considered only as guidelines useful for estimating photographic plates .",
    "the two stars we used to extend the @xmath15 and @xmath16 comparison sequences around v627  cas are tyc  3997  2203  1 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and tyc  3997  1868  1 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .    the data are presented in table  1 . the date ( year/ month/ day/ format ) , the heliocentric jd and the estimated magnitude ( in steps of 0.05 mag ) are given .",
    "further details ( including plate number , exposure time , emulsion and filter types , etc . )",
    "are available via http://ulisse.pd.astro.it / symbio_pg/.",
    "brief notes follow to comment upon the photometric behavior displayed by the program stars .      _",
    "v1413  aql_. the 1962 - 1981 sub - set of plates were already analyzed by munari ( 1992 ) against a different comparison sequence .",
    "the table  1 data confirm the pre - outburst lightcurve modulated by a reflection effect following the 434.1 day orbital period of the post - outburst eclipses .    _",
    "v443  her_. 96 of the 100 @xmath2 band data in table  1 cover the period 1968 - 1977 .",
    "they confirm in periodicity ( 594 day ) and amplitude ( @xmath22 mag ) the later 1979 - 1993 @xmath2 lightcurve of kolotilov et al .",
    "unavoidable small differences in pass - band profiles between the photoelectric and photographic realization of the @xmath2 band can contribute to the slight difference in mean brightness ( @xmath2312.43 for kolotilov et al .",
    "photoelectric photometry , @xmath2312.53 for table  1 data ) .",
    "originally classified as a planetary nebula (= k  47 = pk  26  @xmath26 ) , the symbiotic nature of as  323 has been discovered by sabbadin ( 1986 ) and acker et al .",
    "the spectrum resembles a proto - type symbiotic star , with well developed tio bands in the red , veiling by the circumstellar nebula in the blue and a high ionization emission line spectrum ( he  ii 4686   and 6825   raman scattering of o  vi are both prominent ) , with weak or absent nebular lines .",
    "mikolajewska et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimated a m3 spectral type for the cool giant and @xmath27100 000  k and @xmath281200 @xmath29 for the hot companion .",
    "munari et al . (",
    "2001 ) report @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for observations obtained in 1999 .",
    "the as  323 data from table  1 are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the 1960 - 1990 lightcurve is characterized by a flat quiescence level at @xmath3515.3 , close to the 1999 value .",
    "a sudden brightening occurred at the very end of the observational period : its detection is solid given the careful check of the as  323 image on the plate that excluded local defects .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the as  323 lightcurve is however the series of drops below the quiescent level .",
    "a search for periodicities has revealed several possible periods , the stronger one being p=197.6 days .",
    "the @xmath2 data are phase - plotted against it in figure  1 , showing a lightcurve closely resembling a deep eclipsing binary ( @xmath36 mag )",
    ". more data are however necessary to firmly establish the periodicity , refine the period and confirm the suspected eclipsing nature .",
    "hopefully , similar programs could locate in other archives more plates containing as  323 and solve the issue .",
    "if the p=197.6 days should be confirmed as the orbital period of as  323 , it would be the shortest known among symbiotic stars , with the closest cases being tx cvn ( 199 days ) , t  crb ( 228 days ) and bd-21.3873 ( 282 days ; cf .",
    "belczyski et al .",
    "the m3 giant in as  323 would then quite probably fill its roche lobe and show the characteristic _ ellipsoidal _ distortion of its lightcurve .      according to kolotilov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , v627  cas ( = as  501 ) is an unusual type of symbiotic star because it could harbor a post - agb cool giant . during the post - agb phase",
    "a star is supposed to evolve very rapidly .",
    "the secular decrease in brightness evident in figure  2 could be then ascribed to global modifications of the cool giant that dominates the emission of v627  cas in the @xmath2 band .",
    "kolotilov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also reported on a small amplitude pulsation of the cool giant with a period of p=466 days .",
    "this periodicity ( or any other else ) does not seem to be present in the @xmath2 or @xmath9 band data of table  1 , which cover an earlier time interval .",
    "the fact that the cool giant may have started to pulsate on such short time scales may again argue in favor of the kolotilov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) scenario of a post - agb , rapidly evolving star .        our data in table  1",
    "extend over @xmath38 , the same as in older records , without evidence for separated quiescence and outburst phases and favoring instead a continuous variability .",
    "it has also to be noticed that at the time of the 1925  outburst \" heii  4686 was in strong emission ( harwood 1925 ) , contrary to the typical behavior of symbiotic stars .",
    "we argue that the variability so far observed in cm  aql is not modulated by outbursts , but it is instead periodic in nature . in figure  3 the data of harwood ( 1925 ) and those of table  1 are phase plotted according to a period of p=1058 days .",
    "the sinusoidal shape would suggest a _ reflection effect _ interpretation .",
    "a @xmath392 mag amplitude would however be unusually large for a symbiotic star .",
    "clearly , further data from other plate archives are necessary to firmly address the period , the nature of the sinusoidal - like variability and the absence of outbursts .",
