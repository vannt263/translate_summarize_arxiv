    "various astronomical and cosmological observations show that there is dark matter ( dm ) making up about 20% of the energy of our universe .",
    "although the evidence for dm has been established for many decades , the identity of its basic constituents has so far remained elusive .",
    "one of the popular candidates for dm is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . among a large number of possible wimps ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle has been studied most .",
    "although this possibility has many attractive features , direct experimental evidence for it has not been discovered .",
    "there are other possible wimps which can explain the dm relic density .",
    "the simplest model is the sm+d , which extends the sm by the addition of a real gauge - singlet scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "this singlet field , the darkon field , can play the role of dm .",
    "the darkon as dm was first considered by silveira and zee  @xcite .",
    "implications of this model and some variations of it have been explored by other groups  @xcite . in the sm+d model ,",
    "interactions between darkon and sm particles are only through higgs boson exchange .",
    "this may lead to significant modifications to the higgs boson property .    at present",
    "the dm mass is not known .",
    "it can be as heavy as a few hundred gev to a few tev from indirect dm search  @xcite , such as pamela  @xcite , atic  @xcite and fermi - lat  @xcite . a dm of mass 50 to 70 gev may also explain the gamma - ray excess observed in the egret data  @xcite .",
    "there are also evidences , such as dama  @xcite and cogent  @xcite , indicating that the dm mass can be as low as a few gev",
    ". the implications with a light or heavy dm can be very different .",
    "if the dm mass is smaller than a half of the higgs boson mass , in the sm+d model the higgs boson can decay into a pair of dm fields , which results in a large invisible branching ratio for the higgs boson .",
    "the higgs boson will be searched for at the lhc and may well be discovered in the near future .",
    "if a higgs boson with a small invisible decay width will be found , the sm+d model with small dm mass will be in trouble . other direct search of dm also provide constraints on the dm mass in this model  @xcite . in this work",
    "we study implications of low dm mass on sm+d and a two - higgs - doublet extension ( thdm+d ) .",
    "we find that in thdm+d it is possible to have a higgs boson with a small invisible branching ratio and at the same time the dm can have a low mass in the a few gev to about a half of higgs boson mass range .    before discussing thdm+d ,",
    "let us briefly summarize the main results of the dm in the sm+d model . since the darkon @xmath0 must interact weakly with the sm matter fields and be stable to play the role of dm , the simplest way to introduce the darkon is to impose a discrete @xmath1 symmetry so that it can only be created or annihilated in pairs",
    ". in a renormalizable theory @xmath0 can only couple to the higgs doublet field @xmath2 .",
    "so besides the kinetic energy term @xmath3 , the lagrangian of the darkon interaction part takes the form  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are free parameters .",
    "@xmath8 is invariant under the @xmath1 symmetry where only @xmath0 is odd and all other sm fields are even .",
    "the parameters in the potential should be carefully chosen such that @xmath0 does not develop a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the @xmath1 symmetry is unbroken , which will ensure that the darkon does not mix with the higgs field and thus possible fast decays into other sm particles will be avoided .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) can be rewritten to describe the interaction of the physical higgs boson @xmath9 with the darkon as @xmath10 where @xmath11gev is the vev of the neutral component of @xmath2 , the second term contains the darkon mass @xmath12 , and the last term , @xmath13 , plays an important role in determining the relic density of the dm . at the leading order , the relic density of the darkon results from the annihilation of a darkon pair into sm particles through higgs exchange , namely @xmath14 , where @xmath15 indicates sm particles .",
    "since the darkon is cold dm , the speed of darkon is highly non - relativistic and the invariant mass of a darkon pair is roughly @xmath16 . given the determined sm+d lagrangian , the @xmath9-mediated annihilation cross - section of a darkon pair into sm particles is then given by  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative speed of the @xmath19 pair in their center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , @xmath20 is a virtual higgs boson with an invariant mass @xmath21 which couples to the other states as the physical @xmath9 with mass @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is any possible decay mode of @xmath20 . for a given model , @xmath24",

    "the elastic cross section of dm with nucleon can also be calculated and compared with the direct dm search data .",

    "we will use the numerical value for @xmath32 in ref .",
    "@xcite based on chiral perturbation theory estimate , @xmath33    the @xmath34 decay width is given by @xmath35    there are only a small number of unknown parameters in this model .",
    "besides the higgs boson mass @xmath36 , the other two unknown parameters we concern are the darkon mass @xmath37 and the coupling constant @xmath7 . for a given @xmath36 , the standard relic density calculation  @xcite can be used to constrain the allowed parameter space for @xmath37 and @xmath7 . with this constraint ,",
    "the cross section for direct dm search can be calculated and then compared with the current direct dm searching data , which further constrains the parameter space allowed .",

    "[ fig : smd ] that a low mass dm roughly in the range of 10 gev to a half of higgs boson mass is in conflict with direct dm search .",

    "[ fig : smdbr ] that when the dm mass is low enough that @xmath38 is kinematically allowed , the properties of the higgs boson will be dramatically affected .",

    "[ fig : smdbr ] . the invisible decay of higgs boson can be detected only if there are additional objects produced together with the higgs boson , since a hadron collider only measures the transverse missing energy .",
    "thus the invisible decay of the higgs boson can be detected in the associated production channels like @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite , which has been further studied in detail in a recent atlas analysis  @xcite .",
    "a low dm mass will be ruled out if a higgs boson with a small invisible decay branching ratio is found at the lhc .    in this work",
    "we investigate whether a low mass dm and a higgs boson with a small invisible branching ratio are able to be reconciled in two higgs doublet extensions of darkon models ( thdm+d ) .",
    "we find that such a possibility can actually be realized in this model .",
    "depending on how the two higgs doublets @xmath45 and @xmath46 couple to the fermions in the sm , there are three types of thdm  @xcite . in the thdmi ,",
    "only one of the higgs doublets gives masses to all the fermions . in the thdmii ,",
    "the up - type fermions get mass from only one of the higgs doublets , say @xmath46 , and the down - type fermions from the other doublet . in the thdmiii ,",
    "both @xmath45 and @xmath46 give masses to all the fermions .",
    "since only one higgs doublet generates the fermion masses in the thdmi , the higgs couplings to fermions are the same as in the sm , up to an overall scaling factor .",
    "therefore the higgs couplings in the thdmi+d are similar to those in the sm+d studied in the previous section and thus can not help to ease the tension between the direct searches and the invisible branching ratio . in the thdmiii , there are flavor - changing higgs - quark couplings which introduce too many parameters for the model to be predictable .",
    "so we will concentrate on the thdmii with a darkon field ( thdmii+d ) .",
    "the yukawa interactions of the higgs fields in the thdmii are given by  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 represent the usual quark and lepton fields and @xmath53 are yukawa couplings .",
    "a discrete @xmath54 symmetry , under which @xmath46 and @xmath55 are the only odd fields , has to be introduced to forbid @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 to obtain the yukawa couplings above .",

    "consequently @xmath66 is irrelevant to our darkon relic - density study and direct dm search .",
    "we now write down explicitly the couplings between the cp - even higgs bosons and the vector bosons which are relevant to the higgs decay calculation .",

    "@xmath93    the existence of an additional cp even higgs boson will modify the sm+d model in several ways .",

    "[ fig : smdbr ] , the higgs boson invisible branching ratio is increasing for smaller higgs mass , since the higgs partial width into sm particles is suppressed . the large invisible widths will change the traditional paradigm used for higgs hunting .",
    "although difficult , it may still be possible for such a higgs to be detected directly at cms through the usual sm modes with 30 fb@xmath140 of integrated luminosity  @xcite or by missing transverse energy search at atlas  @xcite .",
    "if no large invisible decay width for higgs boson will be found , the possibility of a low dm mass smaller than half of the higgs boson mass will be ruled out .    in thdm+d",
    ", there are two cp - even higgs bosons and both couple to the dm darkon field .",
    "there are a few extra parameters , which does not help to make the higgs invisible width much smaller if we continue to consider the strategy in sm+d , namely the higgs boson to be detected at the lhc is also the one responsible for the dm relic density .",
    "if we change the strategy and let one higgs boson to be detected at the lhc and the other one to be responsible for the dm relic density , the situation changes instantly .",
    "it is possible to have cancelation in the direct dm detection cross section allowing dm mass to be in the range ruled out in the sm + d model .",
    "the decay branching ratio of the higgs boson , which is the usual one to be detected at the lhc , shows a familiar change for small and large @xmath115 as in the other two higgs doublet models like the thdmii and minimal supersymmetric standard model .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the constraints from dm relic density , direct searches and some implications for the collider experiments in both sm+d and thdm+d . in the sm+d ,",
    "a darkon with mass roughly in the ranges of 10 gev to half of the higgs boson mass is ruled out as a wimp candidate by the direct searches .",
    "for dm roughly lighter than 10 gev , the invisible branching ratio is always very large which may be ruled out if a small invisible width for higgs boson will be found at the lhc . in thdm+d",
    ", the experimental limits can be circumvented due to suppression of the darkon - nucleon elastic cross - section at some values of @xmath73 and @xmath79 . however ,",
    "if the higgs boson is responsible for dark matter physics and also be detected at the lhc , using the darkon - higgs coupling extracted from the dm relic density , the invisible branching ratio of the would be substantial increase by a large contribution from the invisible mode @xmath34 , if kinematically allowed .",
    "if a higgs boson with a small invisible decay width will be found at the lhc , the possibility will also be in trouble .",
    "we find that with thdm+d , it is possible to adjust parameters such that one of the higgs bosons is primarily responsible for the dm relic density .",
    "the additional higgs boson to be the lighter one to be detected at the lhc with a small invisible branching ratio .",
    "future dm search experiments can further constrain the parameter space of the model .",
    "this could significantly affect higgs searches at the lhc , we expect that it will still be able to probe the darkon model .",
