    "the hypertriton consisting of a neutron , proton and a @xmath1 or @xmath2 , which strongly convert into each other , is bound against @xmath1-deuteron decay by 0.13 @xmath3 0.05 mev . recently",
    "that number could be reproduced  @xcite by solving the faddeev equations based on realistic nn forces and the nijmegen hyperon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "the resulting wavefunction has all two - body correlations exactly built in as enforced by the various two - body forces . as the lightest hypernucleus the hypertriton plays the same role in hypernuclear physics that the deuteron does in nuclear physics .",
    "however , in contrast to the deuteron , the hypertriton is subject to the weak decay and has a lifetime comparable to that of the free @xmath1 , @xmath4 seconds .",
    "the first data on light hypernuclear lifetimes have been obtained using bubble chamber experiments and emulsion works which in most cases only detected the mesonic decay modes .",
    "these measurements suffered from low precision , very poor statistics and difficulties with particle identification , leading to fairly large error bars .",
    "along with the mesonic two - body decay mode @xmath5 there are the corresponding mesonic multi - body decay modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the most precise experiment to date for the combined two- and multi - body decay modes gave a value of @xmath8 seconds  @xcite .",
    "a similar measurement furthermore was also able to estimate the decay branching ratio @xmath9 all @xmath10 mesonic modes ) as @xmath11 .",
    "besides the mesonic decay channels there are also two nonmesonic modes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "while it is well known that these channels dominate the weak decay of heavy hypernuclei they are expected to be rare for the hypertriton since the mesonic modes are not pauli suppressed  @xcite . as a first step this two - baryon decay mode @xmath14 can be understood in terms of the free - space decay mechanism @xmath15 with virtual pion that is absorbed on a second nucleon bound in the hypernucleus  @xcite .",
    "however , the large momentum transfer involved in the reaction leads to a mechanism that is sensitive to the short distance behavior of the amplitude and allows for the exchange of heavier mesons .",
    "the production of these mesons would be below threshold for the free - space @xmath1 decay , but they can contribute through virtual exchange in a two - baryon decay channel .",
    "the weak nonmesonic decay channel is important since it allows access to the fundamental aspects of the four - fermion , strangeness changing weak interaction . in general , starting with the standard model electroweak hamiltonian and taking into account qcd corrections at short distances yields an effective weak @xmath16 interaction that could presumably predict the relative strength of the @xmath17=0 and @xmath17=1 transition .",
    "thus , hadronic weak matrix elements of the form @xmath18 can be calculated  @xcite .",
    "using these weak vertices as a starting point for effective nuclear two - body operators that are then implanted into the nucleus with the usual nuclear many - body wave functions provides the testing ground for the effective interaction .",
    "parity violation in hadronic systems represents a unique tool to study aspects of the nonleptonic weak interaction between hadrons .",
    "the nonmesonic process resembles the weak @xmath19s=0 nucleon - nucleon interaction that has been explored experimentally in parity - violating nn scattering measurements .",
    "however , the @xmath14 two - body decay mode can explore both the parity - conserving ( pc ) and the parity - violating ( pv ) sector of the @xmath19s=1 weak baryon - baryon interaction while in the weak nn system one is limited to the weak pv interaction .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches to the @xmath14 decay mode have been developed over the last thirty years which are more extensively reviewed in ref .",
    "the @xmath20 weak nucleon - nucleon interaction at low and intermediate energies has generally been described in a meson exchange model involving one strong interaction vertex and one weak one ; the same approach can be used for a microscopic description of the @xmath17=1 @xmath14 mechanism .    a recently completed major study of the nonmesonic decay of p - shell hypernuclei  @xcite found that proper short - range correlations in the initial and final state are of major importance in predicting decay rates and asymmetry observables .",
    "however , in a shell - model framework bound state wave functions , spectroscopic factors , short - range correlations and final state interactions do not all originate from the same underlying dynamics and , therefore , introduce approximations that may be difficult to quantify .",
    "since the aim of investigating the nonmesonic decay is to extract information on hadronic weak vertices from the @xmath21 process the decay of few - body hypernuclei offers a window since all nuclear structure ingredients are derived from the same baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "it thus appears worthwhile to repeat a former study  @xcite on the weak nonmesonic decay of the hypertriton , where a simplified uncorrelated deuteron-@xmath1 wavefunction has been used .",
    "we expect that correlations should play an important role , since the mesons emitted by the weak hyperon - nucleon transition are reabsorbed by the nucleons .",
    "the resulting meson - exchange operator acts like a two - body force and consequently probes the hypertriton wavefunction in its dependence on the pair distance between a hyperon and a nucleon .",
    "furthermore , the final three nucleons will interact strongly with each other , which might influence significantly the decay process .",
    "this dynamical ingredient has been neglected in ref .",
    "@xcite and will now be fully incorporated .    in section  [ secii ]",
    "the theoretical formalism for the evaluation of the decay matrix element will be given .",

    "the final scattering state carries , however , additional isotopic spin quantum numbers @xmath55 .    throughout the paper",
    "the normalisation of the momentum states is always like .",
    "the operator @xmath28 is of two - body character and acts between the @xmath1 and a nucleon . in the hypertriton wavefunction",
    "let us denote the @xmath1 to be particle 1 , then @xmath56 because of the antisymmetry of the hypertriton state and the scattering states with respect to the two nucleons 2 and  3 the nuclear matrix element simplifies to @xmath57    the exact inclusion of the final state interactions among the 3 final nucleons can be performed in analogy to electron scattering on @xmath58he  @xcite .",
    "we exemplify it for the nnp breakup process . for our notation in general",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the scattering state @xmath59 is faddeev decomposed @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the sum of a cyclical and anticyclical permutation of 3 objects and @xmath62 is one faddeev component .",
    "it obeys the faddeev equation @xmath63 with @xmath64 @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the free three - nucleon propagator , @xmath67 the nn ( off - shell ) t - matrix and @xmath68 takes care of the identity of the three nucleons . note that @xmath69 acts in the two - body subsystem described by the relative momentum @xmath70 .",

    "it is then easily seen that this can be put into the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 obeys the faddeev equation @xmath77 note the driving term of that integral equation contains the operator @xmath78 applied to the hypertriton bound state @xmath79 and it also includes rescattering terms of first order in @xmath80 .",
    "the pure plane wave impulse approximation is the first term on the right hand side of ( [ e14 ] ) .    a similar reduction yields for the nd breakup process @xmath81 where now @xmath82 contains the deuteron state @xmath83 : @xmath84 and the same state @xmath85 appears .",
    "using the weak transition operator @xmath86 in the context of a strictly nonrelativistic framework requires some approximations , which we would like to describe in the example of pion exchange  @xcite . according to fig .",

    "the nucleon mass , @xmath96 , and the @xmath1 mass , @xmath97 , are replaced by their average , @xmath98 .",
    "then one finds @xmath99 with @xmath100    we have to use two types of jacobi momenta , one set referring to the hypertriton composed of @xmath101 and another set for the final state of three nucleons .",

    "the @xmath1 has to change into a neutron or a proton by emission of a @xmath111 or @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "this can be formally accomplished by setting artificially the @xmath1 state to be @xmath112 in isospin and introducing @xmath113 at the vertex .",
    "this is a well known trick  @xcite and is in agreement with the empirical @xmath114 rule . as a consequence the two - body force  ( [ e21 ] ) has to be multiplied by @xmath115 .    now in the hypertriton the @xmath1-particle is treated as a strongly interacting particle and has therefore isospin zero .",
    "the isospin part of the hypertriton ( @xmath1 part only ) is @xmath116 where the indices denote the particles and @xmath117 the obvious isospin coupling for the two nucleons .",

    "the @xmath128 conversion is crucial for the binding of the hypertriton , nevertheless the @xmath127 admixture is extremely small  @xcite .",
    "thus we neglect the contribution of the @xmath129 decay and keep only the @xmath126 part .    in  @xcite the hypertriton state has been determined in a partial wave representation and we refer to  @xcite for the details of our notation .",
    "here we need only the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 are the magnitudes of the jacobi momenta ( [ e23 ] ) and @xmath132 denotes the following set of discrete quantum numbers @xmath133 here @xmath134 describe the coupling of orbital angular momentum @xmath135 and total spin @xmath136 to the total two - body angular momentum @xmath137 of the @xmath138 subsystem , @xmath139 the corresponding coupling of orbital and spin angular momentum of the other nucleon to its total angular momentum @xmath140 , @xmath141 , the resulting @xmath142 coupling to the total angular momentum @xmath143 and finally the isospin coupling of @xmath144 and @xmath145 to total isospin @xmath146 , as described above .    also for the evaluation of the matrix elements ( [ e14 ] ) and  ( [ e16 ] ) and the solution of the faddeev equation  ( [ e15 ] ) we work in a partial wave representation , using a complete set of basis states now for three nucleons . they are again denoted as @xmath147 but adding a subscript @xmath148 to indicate that the jacobi momenta are now from ( [ e4 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : c][fig : pv ] this is hardly surprising . the final result , however , is such that one ends up close to the value with pion exchange only .",

    "if we denote the @xmath70 from the first matrix element as @xmath243 , then it turns out that @xmath244 and @xmath245 in the second ( third ) matrix element , respectively , and for such a @xmath236-value @xmath246 is suppressed .",
    "the other two matrix elements also peak if particles 1 or  2 emerge with zero momenta .",

    "note that the @xmath266-dependence also removes the highest peak values for all 3 peaks .    for the choice of nucleons 1 and 3 being neutrons and 2 a proton we have thus to expect that for a neutron induced decay there should be only one peak at the position @xmath267 and @xmath268 , which is indeed the case as shown in fig .",

    "this is due to the strong interaction in the @xmath274 state , where the nn t - matrix has a pole close to zero energy ( virtual state ) .",

    "it is interesting to see despite the fact that fsi decreases the @xmath277 values significantly , which means a strong rescattering among the three nucleons , that there is only one peak for the n  induced decay and the rescattering does not populate the other two peak areas .",
    "corresponding is also true for the p  induced decay .",
    "again the events for n and p  induced decays seem to add up incoherently in the quantity @xmath277 .",
    "let us now discuss the form ( [ e8.6 ] ) of the differential decay rate expressed in individual momenta in the total momentum zero frame of the decaying hypertriton . after averaging over the initial state polarization and summing over the spin magnetic quantum numbers of the final 3 nucleons the decay rate can depend only on the angle between the two nucleon detectors , @xmath279 .",

    "like in nd scattering we shall from now on call such a configuration , where one final nucleon has zero momentum , a quasi free scattering ( qfs ) configuration .",
    "the final state interaction reduces that enhancement , but it is still pronounced .",
    "in addition we see two fsip s in the full calculation .",

    "that enhancement is reduced and two peaks emerge at the beginning and the end of the s - curve . since there either @xmath287 or @xmath288 are small , we have again configurations , which are close to qfs conditions , now for the nucleon pairs 2,3 and 1,3 , respectively .",
    "this explains the additional enhancements .",
    "now at @xmath289 the enhancement in the middle of the s - curve has disappeared .",
    "that point on the s - curve corresponds exactly to the so called space - star configuration in a @xmath290 process .",
    "all three nucleons receive the same energy and emerge completely symmetrically under @xmath291 pairwise angles .",
    "this is far away from qfs conditions and no enhancement is expected . of course",
    ", at the beginning and end of the s - curve the peaks correspond again to conditions close to qfs .",
    "the situation remains similar at @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "finally a new structure appears at @xmath294 and above all at @xmath295 in the middle of the s - curve .",
    "this is a fsip , which is fully developed for @xmath295 . in principle",
    "it could be used to extract information on the np and nn scattering lengths like in nd breakup processes .    in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] we compare the full calculations to the separate decay rates for n and p  induced processes .",
    "note that in this figure pn means that the proton is nucleon  1 and a neutron is nucleon  2 , which corresponds to @xmath296 , @xmath297 and @xmath298 in the matrix element of eq .",

    "this is no longer true .",
    "the p  induced rate and even more the n  induced rate is significantly lower than the rate built up by the full physical process .",
    "it is interesting to see in cases of fig .",
    "[ f12](b  f ) that the n  induced decay rate for pn detection at the upper end of @xmath51 is practically identical to the decay rate corresponding to the full physical process .",
    "the reason is that at the upper end of @xmath51 the energy @xmath48 ( the proton energy ) is nearly zero ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) , and therefore two neutrons carry essentially all the energy . without fsi",
    "such a case can only be generated by a n  induced decay and qualitatively this picture does not change due to fsi . in case of p  induced decay",
    "its rate for pn and nn detection at the lower end of @xmath51 is practically identical with the full decay rate .",
    "the reason is similar as for the n  induced decay . at the lower end of @xmath51 the energy @xmath49 ( a neutron energy )",
    "is nearly zero .",
    "therefore a proton  neutron pair has to carry essentially all the energy and this has to be generated by a p  induced process .",

    "interesting are also the fsip s , especially pronounced at @xmath295 and @xmath301 . at @xmath295 and for neutron - neutron detections",
    "the proton has to fly in the opposite direction , therefore the p ",
    "induced process has to be mainly responsible for the peak , as is the case . for p - n detection ,",
    "however , both p and n  induced decays can contribute to a fsip and they do .",
    "apparently the p and n  induced decays have to interfere , since the individual rates do not add up to the total physical decay . as a further example we comment on the left strong fsip at @xmath302 .",
    "there are two peaks according to pn and nn detections . for nn detection",
    "( the neutrons have opposite momenta ) this has to be necessarily a pn fsip .",
    "as we see from the figure it receives contributions from n and p  induced processes , again coherently . in case of pn detection ( the proton an a neutron have opposite momenta ) the special location on the @xmath51-curve ( high proton energy ) requires that it is a nn fsip .",
    "therefore the very dominant contribution has to come from the p  induced process .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] .    the corresponding curves , when all mesons are included , are qualitatively the same and only very few examples are displayed in fig .  [ f12.5 ] .",
    "the heights of the fsip s have changed , however , significantly .",
    "finally we consider the question , whether the total n and p  induced decay rates can be separated experimentally . as we already saw",
    "this is not possible in the nd decay channel .",
    "there the two processes interfere coherently and the individual theoretical rates do not sum up to the total rate . in the 3n decay channel",
    "the total rate is very close to the sum of the individual rates for the n and p  induced processes .",

    "( [ e8.5 ] ) ) and displayed in figs .",
    "[ f9][f10 ] the events from the two different processes appear to be nicely separated . on the other hand , in the @xmath305 representation , which is directly accessible using two detectors",

    "the total decay rate into 3 nucleons is @xmath306 we used the fact that @xmath307 depends only on @xmath308 and @xmath51 and introduced the length @xmath309 of the s - curve depending on @xmath308 .",
    "first of all we notice immediately that the pure qfs cases , where a final nucleon momentum is zero , do not contribute , since for @xmath310 @xmath299 and for @xmath311 or @xmath252 the phase space factor in eq .",
    "( [ e8.6 ] ) is zero .",
    "nevertheless an angular configuration with @xmath299 can and should be measured by itself , since along the s - curve there will be one point with the exact qfs conditions and as we saw in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] there the n and p  induced processes can be cleanly separated .",
    "one measures either a pn or a nn pair and they are generated by p and n  induced decays , respectively .",
    "we now discuss the quantity @xmath312 for np and nn detection , respectively .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ f13][f14 ] together with the individual contributions of the p and n  induced processes .",

    "a closer inspection reveals that the sum of the p and n  induced values for each @xmath308 do not sum up very well to the value according to the true physical process , but there are differences up to 10 % ( nn detection ) around @xmath314 .",
    "this is a clear signal for interference .",
    "let us quantify this question .",
    "the representation ( [ e8.5 ] ) of @xmath247 , which has been displayed in figs .",
    "[ f4][f10 ] yields the decay rates for the individual n and p  induced processes as well as for the full physical process ( neutron and proton induced ) when integrated over the whole @xmath248@xmath40 plane . according to figs .",
    "[ f9 ] and  [ f10 ] the n and p  induced processes appear to receive their contributions from well separated areas in the @xmath248@xmath40 plane .",
    "quantitatively , however , this is not true . restricting the integration in @xmath40 and @xmath248 to the region where the peaks in figs .",
    "[ f9][f10 ] are located results in only a certain fraction of the full rates .",
    "quantitatively , if we fix that fraction to 60  % , say , for p and n  induced decays , respectively , we find that the regions displayed in fig .  [ f15 ] contribute . in choosing a certain fraction",
    "we always start integration from the highest values ( located in the peaks ) downwards and stop when the assumed fraction has been reached . except for a small domain ( @xmath315 and",
    "@xmath248 large ) the regions for p and n  induced decays are clearly separated .",
    "of course for fractions smaller than 60  % this will be even more the case . for fractions larger than 60  % , however ,",
    "the regions overlap considerably .",
    "an example for 90  % is also shown in fig .  [ f15 ] .",
    "clearly in such a case the events coming from for p and n  induced decays can not be separated any more experimentally .",
    "we show the fractional decay rates evaluated over corresponding increasing regions in tables  [ t8 ] , [ t9 ] and in figs .",
    "[ f15][f17 ] , where the results refer to full calculations and include all meson exchanges . there",
    "the p and n  induced rates are compared to the observed rate @xmath316 , produced by the full physical process .",
    "thus if we require that the measured value is equal to the p or n  induced decay within a few percent , one has to restrict the integration in the @xmath40@xmath248 plane to certain subregions and the rates to only about 60  % of the full rate .",
    "let us map the @xmath40@xmath248 values into the variables @xmath308@xmath51 , which are directly accessible experimentally .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "( for small neutron energies . )",
    "a correspondingly modified figure could be shown if two neutrons would be detected .",
    "if on the other hand 90  % of the corresponding rates should be detected then the two detectors would receive events from both processes under the same angle @xmath308 and for the same energies in a large portion of the phase space .",
    "thus experimentally it is not possible to separate those processes .",
    "we have to conclude that despite the fact that @xmath318 is rather close to the sum of @xmath319 and @xmath320 , the latter values can not be determined experimentally , only fractions , the smaller , the cleaner .",

    "the final state interaction turned out to be very important and reduces the rates for pwias by about a factor of @xmath240 .",
    "the total nonmesonic decay rate turns out to be @xmath321 of the free @xmath1 decay rate and is smaller by an order of magnitude than a previous estimation[4 ] which used the pion - exchange model , a much more simplified hypertriton wavefunction and no fsi .",
    "while the p and n  induced decays add up manifestly in a coherent manner in the nd decay process , the nnp decay rate is rather well given as the sum of the n and p  induced decay rates .",
