    "<S> we show that a meaningful statistical description is possible in conservative and mixing systems with zero lyapunov exponent in which the dynamical instability is only linear in time . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , ( i ) the sensitivity to initial conditions is given by @xmath0^{1/(1-q)}$ ] with @xmath1 ; ( ii ) the statistical entropy @xmath2 in the infinitely fine graining limit ( i.e. , @xmath3 _ number of cells into which the phase space has been partitioned _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 ) , increases linearly with time only for @xmath1 ; ( iii ) a nontrivial , @xmath5-generalized , pesin - like identity is satisfied , namely the @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these facts ( which are in analogy to the usual behaviour of strongly chaotic systems with @xmath7 ) , seem to open the door for a statistical description of conservative many - body nonlinear systems whose lyapunov spectrum vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to derive macroscopic laws from the underlying microscopic deterministic dynamics crucially depends on whether the latter satisfies or not the randomness assumptions required by statistical mechanics . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> exponentially unstable systems appear precisely those deterministic random systems tacitly required by macroscopic laws of physics . in fact the exponentially unstable motion is called chaotic since almost all orbits , though deterministic , are unpredictable . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the alekseev - brudno theorem @xcite in the algorithmic theory of dynamical systems , according to which the information @xmath8 associated with a segment of trajectory of length @xmath9 is equal , asymptotically , to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the so called ks ( kolmogorov - sinai ) entropy which is positive when the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath12 is positive . + this means that in order to predict a new segment of a chaotic trajectory one needs an additional information proportional to the length of this segment and independent of the previous length of the trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation information can not be extracted from the observation of past history of motion . this inherent randomness exhibited by many newtonian systems </S>",
    "<S> provides hope that classical statistical mechanics can at last be rigorously derived without the use of additional _ ad hoc _ assumptions such as correlations decay and the like .    on the other hand one would like to know whether such a strong property , being sufficient , is also necessary . </S>",
    "<S> certainly ergodicity only is not sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it is known that ergodicity alone , by merely implying that time averages are equal to phase averages , is sufficient to justify equilibrium statistical mechanics , but does not lead to any approach to statistical equilibrium . for the latter , continuous spectrum of the motion and correlations decay is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this property , in the ergodic theory of dynamical systems , is called _ mixing _ and provides statistical independence of different parts of a dynamical trajectory thus allowing a statistical description in terms of few macroscopic variables . </S>",
    "<S> mixing is therefore a stronger property than ergodicity . </S>",
    "<S> however it does not require , in principle , exponential instability . </S>",
    "<S> recently strong empirical evidence has been provided of mixing and diffusive behaviour in dynamical systems with linear instability(zero lyapunov exponent)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , quite remarkably , normal heat transport , obeying the fourier law , has been found in a quasi-1d gas with triangular scatterers @xcite and in the 1d alternate masses hard point gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results clearly demonstrate that linear instability can be sufficient for the derivation of macroscopic laws of physics .    </S>",
    "<S> along these lines , a quite natural step forward is to analyze the connection between linear dynamical instability and the statistical entropy @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , differently from the dynamical ks entropy , is a function of time and depends on the initial probability distribution ( ensemble ) for the state of the system . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was numerically shown that , for symplectic chaotic systems , the time evolution of the _ phase - space averaged _ statistical entropy of out - of - equilibrium initial ensembles displays a stage of linear increase with a slope that coincides with @xmath11 ( and , through the pesin equality , with the sum of positive lyapunov exponents ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the above numerical result , though very interesting , is far from being rigorous . </S>",
    "<S> actually , as pointed out also in a recent paper @xcite , such connection does not hold in systems with intermittent behavior or in systems which , though mixing and exponentially unstable , are characterized by different time scales in the relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of systems like the sinai billiard or the bunimovich stadium in which the local lyapunov exponent is not constant .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address precisely the above problem , namely the connection between statistical entropy and dynamical instability , for a system which is linearly ( instead of exponentially ) unstable . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that in order to recover results analogous to those relating to exponentially unstable systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) a _ generalization _ of the definition of the classical entropic functional @xmath14 ( @xmath15 stands for _ boltzmann - gibbs _ , @xmath16 ) is needed . </S>",
    "<S> a convenient such generalization has been proposed in 1988 @xcite as a basis for generalizing bg statistical mechanics ( for reviews see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this new functional is defined as @xmath17 for equal probabilities @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> if we extremize entropy ( 2 ) with appropriate constraints , we obtain @xcite @xmath21 for the canonical ensemble , where @xmath22 is an inverse - temperature - like parameter , @xmath23 is the hamiltonian , and @xmath24 is the inverse function of @xmath25 , called @xmath5-exponential , i.e. , @xmath26^{1/(1-q ) } \\ ; ( e_1^x = e^x)$ ] . for systems for which @xmath15 statistical mechanics is valid , we have @xmath7 . for anomalous systems ( e.g. , for long - range interactions @xcite ) , we expect @xmath5 to be univocally determined by the ( nonextensive ) universality class to which the system belongs . for example , for the edge of chaos of unimodal maps </S>",
    "<S> it has been exactly shown @xcite , through a renormalization group approach , that : ( i ) in correspondence with the feigenbaum attractor the sensitivity to initial conditions has an upper - bound envelope which is algebraic in time and _ precisely _ given by a @xmath5-exponential function for the specific value @xmath27 ( this value is exactly deduced from the @xmath28 feigenbaum s universal constant ) ; ( ii ) the connection between this power - law dynamical instability and a _ linear _ statistical entropy production - rate is obtained through the form ( [ q_entropy ] ) , for the same value of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are available through a number of different methods ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider instead a conservative , linearly unstable system , defined by the area preserving triangle map @xmath29 @xcite on a torus @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sign of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two parameters ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the following facts and numerical results have been established @xcite : for rational values of @xmath34 the system is pseudo - integrable , as the dynamics is confined on invariant curves . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath36 and @xmath28 is irrational , the dynamics is ergodic but the phase - space is filled very slowly ( see also ref.@xcite ) , while for incommensurate irrational values of @xmath34 the dynamics is ergodic and mixing with dynamical correlation function decaying as @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress here that , as shown in @xcite , the triangle map does not have any secondary time scales and that the exploration of the phase phase by a given orbit is arbitrarily close to that of a random model .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be argued that the triangle map possesses essential features of bounce maps of polygonal billiards and 1d hardpoint gases @xcite , namely the parabolic stability type in combination with decaying dynamical correlations , and as such represents a paradigmatic model for a larger class of systems . for the sake of definiteness , in the following we will fix the parameter values @xmath38/2 $ ] , </S>",

    "<S> the action of the map ( [ triangle ] ) initially divides the area covered by the ensemble into different unconnected portions , each essentially stretched along a straight line . after a certain amount of time these portions overlap until a slow relaxation process to a complete mixing </S>",
    "<S> is observed .     </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath43 the fraction of orbits which after @xmath44 time steps overlap with the cell of label @xmath45 . by means of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q_entropy ] ) we can then compute @xmath40 . typically , in order to get reliable results the statistics needs to be improved by averaging over many random initial cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for a chaotic system with dynamical entropy @xmath11 , one expects @xmath46 in the limit @xmath47 and for sufficiently large @xmath44 ( i.e. , after a possible initial transient ) @xcite , whereas for a finite @xmath48 , @xmath49 grows linearly with @xmath44 during an _ intermediate stage _ , before saturation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with such a behaviour , the time - evolution of the bg entropy associated to the triangle map ( [ triangle ] ) is characterized by an intermediate stage where the entropy @xmath50 grows _ logarithmically _ with time @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations of @xmath40 provide clear empirical evidence that , in analogy with the results for the edge of chaos of unimodal maps @xcite , there is only a specific value of @xmath51 for which a linear entropy production rate is observed when @xmath48 is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , only for @xmath1 we get @xmath52 with the numerical constant @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this production - rate regime is associated to the first stage of the mixing process ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) shows that the linear increase with slope @xmath53 is reached , in the limit @xmath47 , from above . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that for a meaningful definition of the probabilities @xmath18 the condition @xmath58 has to be fulfilled .    the above numerical result </S>",
    "<S> directly follows from the fact that the mixing process occurs essentially along straight lines . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the length of the segment that describes the maximum separation between points of the ensemble at time @xmath44 , and @xmath61 is the size of a single cell partition . </S>",
    "<S> if we linearize map ( [ triangle ] ) then the growth of the tangent vector is given by @xmath62 which leads to @xmath63 this linear increase of @xmath60 implies the linear increase of @xmath56 in ( [ w_sen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that if the partition is not fine enough , relation ( [ w_sen ] ) breaks down . </S>",

    "<S> these results suggest that a thermostatistical approach of such systems is possible . indeed , the structure that we have exhibited here for the time dependence of @xmath57 , is totally analogous to the one that has been recently exhibited @xcite for the @xmath42-dependence of @xmath57 , where @xmath42 is the number of elements of a many - body system . </S>",

    "<S> in this paper we have considered an abstract model of dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> however the same features of linear instability together with a nice diffusive behaviour are exhibited by more realistic systems like billiards in irrational polygons and one dimensional systems of unequal masses hard point particles . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand this fact generalizes the validity of our conclusions . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> all these systems belong to the extreme case of linear instability leading to the value @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> . certainly it would be much more interesting to find dynamical systems leading to @xmath83 . </S>",
