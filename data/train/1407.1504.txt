    "in the classical general relativity the geometry of the spacetime near a charged black hole is described by reissner - nordstrm metric . in the low - energy string theory ,",
    "the solution for the static charged black hole was obtained by gibbons and maeda ( 1988 ) and three years later , independently , by garfinkle , horowitz and strominger ( 1991 ) .",

    "dilaton the solution found by horowitz corresponds to a gmghs black hole .",
    "the line element of the metric is : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is related to the electrical charge of the black hole and @xmath2 to its mass . if @xmath3 the singularity is inside the event horizon .",
    "if @xmath4 , the area of the events horizon shrinks to zero .",
    "this case is known as _",
    "extremal limit_.    the region inside the events horizon of a black hole can not be seen by an external observer .",
    "all the information concerning the black hole are derived studying the behaviour of matter and light in its exterior . a free test particle moves on a timelike geodesics and a photon on a null geodesics .",
    "this is the reason why if we want to describe the motion in the vicinity of a black hole we have to solve the geodesic equations .    in classical general relativity as well as in string",
    "theory , geodesics of black holes are studied extensively .",
    "the critical parameters for photon and timelike geodesics for kerr black holes and reissner - nordstrm black holes have been found from conditions for multiple roots of corresponding polynomials by zakharov ( 1994 , 2014 ) and zakharov et .",
    "al . ( 2005a , b , 2012 ) . the null geodesics of static charged black holes in heterotic string theory were analysed by fernando ( 2012 ) .",
    "the circular null and timelike geodesics for non - extremal and extremal gmghs black hole were investigated by pradhan ( 2012 ) .",
    "the exact solutions of timelike geodesics of an extremal gmghs black hole were derived in blaga and blaga ( 1998 ) . the existence and stability of the circular orbits for the timelike geodesics of a gmghs black hole were examined in blaga ( 2013 ) .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the timelike geodesics of a charged black hole in heterotic string theory was done by olivares and villanueva ( 2013 ) , article in which the authors obtained the solution of the geodesic equations in terms of elliptic @xmath5-weierstrass function .",
    "our goal is to classify the orbits of free test particles in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric dilaton black hole using the effective potential .",
    "this approach enables us to identify the type of orbit described by a particle around a gmghs black hole without solving the equations of motion .",
    "the type of the orbit described by a free test particles around a given gmghs black hole depends on its angular momentum , energy and initial position .",
    "the qualitative results are accompanied by plots of possible orbits described by free test particles around different gmghs , obtained by numerical integration of the equations of motion . the initial condition for a given type of black hole",
    "were chosen using the knowledge about the peculiarities of the effective potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the section 2 we derive the geodesic equations from the lagrangian corresponding to the metric ( [ metr ] ) . in the section 3",
    "we emphasize some properties of the effective potential of a free test particle for both a non - extremal and extremal gmghs . in the section 4",
    "we classify the possible trajectories around a gmghs black hole with @xmath6 , respectively @xmath7 and plot the numerical solution of the geodesic equations for different values of the parameters involved in our analysis .",
    "the conclusion are given in the last section .",
    "we can derive the geodesic equations directly computing the christoffel coefficients for the given metric or using hamilton - jacobi theory ( see for example blaga and blaga 1998 ) or writing the euler - lagrange equations ( see fernando 2012 ) .",
    "we follow here the later approach described by chandrasekhar ( 1983 ) .",
    "the lagrangian for the metric ( [ metr ] ) is : @xmath8 where the dot means the differentiation with respect to @xmath9 - affine parameter along the geodesic .",
    "this parameter is chosen so that @xmath10 on a timelike geodesics , @xmath11 on a null geodesics and @xmath12 on a space - like geodesics .    the coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 are cyclic .",
    "therefore the motion has two first integrals derived from the euler - lagrange for time and latitude as follows . from the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath13",
    "we get @xmath15 known as the energy integral .",
    "the real constant @xmath16 is the total energy of the particle .",
    "the second integral of motion is obtained from the euler - lagrange for @xmath14 @xmath17 known as the integral of angular momentum .    from the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath18",

    "this means that the motion is confined in a plane as in schwarzschild spacetime or in newtonian gravitational field .    if @xmath23 during the motion the angular momentum integral ( [ imc ] ) becomes @xmath24 where the real constant @xmath25 is the angular momentum about an axis normal at the plane in which the motion took place",
    ".    the euler - lagrange equation corresponding to the radial coordinate is complicated .",
    "therefore , we replace it with a relation derived from the constancy of the lagrangian . if we substitute in eq .",

    "these two equations are identical with the equations of radial timelike geodesics in schwarzschild spacetime ( chandrasekhar 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , the motion of free test particles on radial geodesics in the vicinity of these two kind of black holes will have the same properties .",
