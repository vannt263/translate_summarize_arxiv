    "the possibility of controlling the flow of the electron spins in semiconductor structures by external electric means through spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) has dominated the recent past of spintronics research .",
    "this fundamental principle , first explored in the datta - das spin transistor configuration,@xcite has been guiding a sustained effort in understanding all the phenomenological implications of this interactions on systems of electrons .",
    "the coupling between spin and orbital motion results either from the two - dimensional confinement ( rashba)@xcite or from the inversion asymmetry of the bulk crystal structure ( dresselhaus).@xcite the usual expression of the the spin - orbit hamiltonian @xmath0 retains only the linear terms in the electron momentum @xmath1 and is given by @xmath2 the rashba and dresselhaus coupling constants are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , while @xmath5 are the pauli matrices . in general , the two interactions are simultaneously present and often have comparable strengths .",
    "while @xmath3 , the coupling constant of the rashba interaction , can be modified by external electric fields induced by external gates , the strength of the dresselhaus soi , @xmath4 , is fixed by the crystal structure and by the thickness of the quasi two - dimensional electron system.@xcite in many situations of interest , an additional energy scale is introduced by the zeeman interaction of the electron spin with an external magnetic field , proportional to the effective gyromagnetic factor , @xmath6 , which depends on the material energy - band structure . while @xmath7 is very small in gaas , it can be more that 100 times larger in insb .",
    "the interplay between the two types of soi , which have competing effects on the precession of the electron spin as they rotate it in opposite directions , and the zeeman splitting , which minimizes the energy by aligning the spin parallel to the external field , determines the ground state polarization of the electron system and the characteristics of spin transport .",
    "the investigation of such problems in mesoscopic rings has been pursued intensively by several authors .",
    "@xcite in particular , it was noticed that , in the absence of the coulomb interaction among the electrons , the interference between the rashba and dresselhaus precessions relative to the orbital motion , leads to the creation of an inhomogeneous spin and charge distribution around the ring.@xcite the charge inhomogeneity created in this situation has a symmetric structure with two maxima and two minima around the ring and will be called here a charge - density deformation ( cdd ) .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction on this type of charge distribution has been considered for two electrons .",
    "it was obtained that , on account of the electrostatic repulsion , the two electrons become even more localized in the potential minima associated to the cdd , leading to an amplitude increase.@xcite    in this work we obtain an estimate of the effect of the coulomb interaction on the charge and spin distribution associated with @xmath8 and @xmath9 electrons in a ring with soi coupling by an exact diagonalization procedure that uses the configuration interaction method .",
    "our results indicate that when the number of electrons increases , the mutual repulsion leads to more uniform charge distribution around the ring , generating a dramatically flattened cdd .",
    "in contrast , the spin - density deformation ( sdd ) is amplified by the coulomb effects .",
    "this can be explained by the appearance of a stronger repulsion between same spin electrons , leading to more favorable spin orientations .",
    "the system of interest in our problem is a two - dimensional quantum ring of exterior and interior radii , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
