    "consider the ordinary differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are smooth and @xmath6-periodic in time @xmath7 ( @xmath4 is also @xmath6-periodic in @xmath8 ) ; the dots denote derivatives with respect to time .",
    "equations to describe the motion of one - dimensional physical systems are often of this form , in which case the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be considered as an external driving force and the parameter @xmath11 represents the damping coefficient , which we shall assume positive .",
    "first , for convenience , let us summarise some of the already known ideas regarding systems of the form , which can be found in the literature @xcite . when @xmath11 is fixed at zero , the system is hamiltonian and no attractors are present",
    ". for @xmath12 numerical experiments show that a finite set of attractors exist : this is consistent with palis conjecture @xcite .",
    "the number of attractors present and the percentage of phase space covered by their basins of attraction depend upon the chosen values of the parameters ( perturbation parameter @xmath13 and damping coefficient @xmath11 ) , but , for all values of the parameters , the union of the corresponding basins of attraction completely fill the phase space , up to a set of zero measure . moreover",
    "if the system is a perturbation of an integrable system ( perturbation regime ) , all attractors found numerically turn out to be either fixed points or periodic solutions with periods that are rational multiples of the forcing period ( subharmonic solutions ) ; we can not exclude the presence of chaotic attractors @xcite , but apparently they either do not arise or seem to be irrelevant .    generally in the literature the damping coefficient is taken as constant , but in many physical systems it changes non - periodically over time .",
    "this can be due to several factors , such as the heating or cooling of a mechanical system and the wear out or rust on mechanical parts . despite this ,",
    "usually models and numerical simulations of such systems only take the final value of dissipation into account when calculating basins of attraction .",
    "the recent paper @xcite puts forward the idea that , although the final value of dissipation determines which attractors exist , the relative sizes of their basins of attraction depend on the evolution of the dissipation .",
    "in particular the effect of dissipation increasing to some constant value over a given time span induces a significant change to the sizes of the basins of attraction in comparison to those when dissipation is constant .",
    "let us illustrate in more detail the phenomenology .",
    "suppose that for two values @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the damping coefficient , with @xmath16 , the same set of attractors exists .",
    "provided the difference between the two values is sufficiently large , the relative sizes of the basins of attraction under the two coefficients will in general be appreciably different .",
    "if we allow the damping coefficient @xmath11 to depend on time , @xmath17 , and vary from @xmath18 to @xmath19 over an initial period of time @xmath20 , after which it remains constant at the value @xmath15 , then the sizes of the basins of attraction will be different from those where the system has constant coefficient @xmath15 throughout . moreover if @xmath20 is taken larger , the sizes of the basins of attraction tend towards those for the system under constant @xmath21 : this reflects the fact that the damping coefficient remains close to @xmath18 for longer periods of time .",
    "now consider two values @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the damping coefficient for which the corresponding sets of attractors @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not the same . as a system evolving under dissipation",
    "is expected to have only finitely many attractors , there can only be a finite number of attractors which exist for one of the two values and not for the other one .",
    "what happens is that , by varying @xmath24 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , an attractor can either appear or disappear , and in the latter case it can disappear either without leaving any trace or being replaced by a new attractor by bifurcation .",
    "suppose , for instance , that the only difference between @xmath25 and @xmath23 is that the attractor @xmath26 simply disappears , that is @xmath27 ; then , if the time @xmath20 over which @xmath24 varies is large , each remaining attractor tends to have a basin of attraction not smaller than that it has for @xmath11 fixed at @xmath18 : the reason being , again , that the damping coefficient remains close to @xmath18 for a long time and , moreover , the trajectories which would be attracted by @xmath28 at @xmath29 will move towards some other attractor when @xmath28 disappears .",
    "if , instead , the only difference between the sets of attractors @xmath22 and @xmath30 is that the attractor @xmath31 is replaced by an attractor @xmath32 , say by period doubling bifurcation , then , letting @xmath24 vary from @xmath18 to @xmath19 over a sufficiently large time @xmath20 causes the size of the basin of attraction of @xmath32 to tend towards that of the basin of attraction that @xmath33 has for @xmath29 .",
    "we summarise our results by the following statements .    1 .",
    "if @xmath22 , the set of attractors at @xmath21 , is a subset of @xmath30 , the set of attractors which exist at @xmath34 , that is @xmath35 , then , as the time @xmath20 over which @xmath24 is varied from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is taken larger , the basins of attraction tend towards those when @xmath11 is kept constant at @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , if an attractor belongs to @xmath36 , then the larger @xmath37 the more negligible is the corresponding basin of attraction .",
    "if the set of attractors at fixed @xmath38 is a proper subset of those which exist at @xmath21 , that is @xmath39 , then , as @xmath20 is taken larger , the basins of attraction for the attractors which exist at both @xmath18 and @xmath19 change so that for @xmath24 varying from @xmath18 to @xmath15 they tend to become greater than or equal to those for constant @xmath21 .",
    "3 .   if an attractor @xmath28 exists for @xmath21 but is destroyed as @xmath24 tends towards @xmath19 , and a new attractor @xmath40 is created from it by bifurcation ( we will explicitly investigate the case of saddle - node or period doubling bifurcations ) , then the size of the basin of attraction of @xmath32 , as @xmath20 is taken larger , tends towards that of @xmath28 at constant @xmath21 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath41 is the set of attractors which exist at both @xmath29 and @xmath34 , that is @xmath42 , and none of the elements in @xmath43 are linked by bifurcation to elements in @xmath44 , then , as @xmath20 is taken larger , the phase space covered by the basins of attraction of the attractors which belong to @xmath41 tends towards 100% .",
    "moreover , all such attractors have a basin of attraction larger than or equal to that they have when the coefficient of dissipation is fixed at @xmath29 .    the main model used in @xcite to convey some of the ideas above is a version of the forced cubic oscillator , which is of the form of the first equation in , with @xmath45 .",
    "this system , considered in the perturbation regime ( both @xmath13 and @xmath11 small ) , apart from the fixed point and as far as the numerics fortells , exhibits only oscillatory attractors with different periods depending on the parameter values .",
    "also discussed in @xcite is the relevance to the spin - orbit problem , describing an asymmetric ellipsoidal satellite moving in a keplerian elliptic orbit around a planet @xcite : the corresponding equations of motion are of the form of the second equation in , with the tidal friction term @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 , with @xmath24 slowly increasing in time because of the the cooling of the satellite .    in the present paper",
    "we wish to extend the discussion to the pendulum with periodically oscillating support @xcite .",
    "the latter is a system which has been already extensively studied in the literature ( we refer to @xcite for a list of references ) : it offers a wide variety of dynamics and , because of the separatrix of the unperturbed system , in the perturbation regime , unlike the cubic oscillator , also includes rotatory attractors in addition to the oscillatory attractors .",
    "an important difference with respect to the results in @xcite is the following . in @xcite ,",
    "if an attractor exists for some value of @xmath11 , it is found to exist for smaller values of @xmath11 too .",
    "this is not always true for the pendulum considered in the present paper , where we will see that , at least for some values of the parameters , both increasing and decreasing @xmath11 can destroy attractors as well as create new ones .",
    "however , this occurs away from the perturbation regime , where the system can no longer be considered as a perturbation of an integrable one : the appearance and disappearance of attractors would occur also in the case of the cubic oscillator for larger values of the forcing .",
    "in addition to the case of increasing dissipation studied in @xcite , here we also include the case where the damping coefficient decreases to a constant value , which is appropriate for physical systems where joints are initially tight and require time to loosen . in this case similar phenomena are expected .",
    "for instance , as the value of variation time @xmath20 is taken larger , the amount of phase space covered by each of the basins of attraction should tend towards that corresponding to original value @xmath18 of @xmath11 , providing the set of attractors remains the same .",
    "the non - linear pendulum with vertically oscillating support is described by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a smooth @xmath6-periodic function and the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the length , amplitude and frequency of the oscillations of the support and the gravitational acceleration , respectively , all of which remain constant ; for the sake of simplicity we shall take @xmath54 in , as in @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", the parameter @xmath11 represents the damping coefficient , which , for analysis where it remains constant , we shall model as @xmath55 , where @xmath13 is small and @xmath56 is an integer .",
    "we shall consider as a pair of coupled first order non - autonomous differential equations by letting @xmath57 and @xmath58 , such that the phase space is @xmath59 and the system can be written as @xmath60 the system described by can be non - dimensionalised by taking @xmath61 so that it becomes @xmath62 or , written as a system of first order differential equations , @xmath63 where the dashes represent differentiation with respect to the new time @xmath64 and @xmath11 has been normalised so as not to contain the frequency .",
    "linearisation of the system about either fixed point results in a system of the form of mathieu s equation , see for instance @xcite .",
    "when the downwards fixed point is linearly stable , it is possible , for certain parameter values , to prove analytically the conditions for which the fixed point attracts a full measure set of initial conditions ; see appendix [ linearisedapp ] .    in the sections that follow we shall use the non - dimensionalised version of the system , preferable for numerical implementation as it reduces the number of parameters in the system . in section [ thresholdssect ] we detail the calculations of the threshold values for the attractors , that is the values of constant @xmath11 below which periodic attractors exist in the perturbation regime ( small @xmath65 ) .",
    "as we shall see , because of the presence of the separatrix for the unperturbed pendulum , this will be of limited avail for practical purposes : the persisting periodic solutions found to first order are in general too close to the separatrix for the perturbation theory to converge . in section [ pennumericsect ]",
    "we present numerical results , in the case of both constant and non - constant ( either increasing or decreasing ) dissipation , for values of the parameters in the perturbation regime . since for such values",
    "the downwards position turns out to be stable , we shall refer to this case as the downwards pendulum .",
    "next , in section [ invpennumericsect ] we perform the numerical analysis for values of the parameters for which the upwards position is stable ( hence such a case will be referred to as the inverted pendulum ) .",
    "of course such parameter values are far away from the perturbation regime : as a consequence additional phenomena occur , including period doubling and saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "in section [ numericssection ] we include a discussion of numerical methods used .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions and briefly discuss some open problems and possible directions for future investigation .",
    "the method used below to calculate the threshold values of @xmath11 below which given attractors exist follows that described in @xcite , where it was applied to the damped quartic oscillator and the spin - orbit model .",
    "we consider the system , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "this approach is well suited to compute the leading order of the threshold values . in general , it would be preferable to write @xmath11 as a function of @xmath13 of the form @xmath69 ( bifurcation curve ) , and fix the constants @xmath70 by imposing formal solubility of the equations to any perturbation order , see @xcite ; however this only produces higher order corrections to the leading order value .    for @xmath71",
    "the system reduces to the simple pendulum @xmath72 , which admits periodic solutions inside the separatrix ( librations or oscillations ) and outside the separatrix ( rotations ) . in terms of the variables",

    "nevertheless , once more , the larger @xmath20 the smaller is the variation in the relative area : for instance in table [ tap00502 ] for @xmath208 the relative area of the basin of attraction of the fixed point has become nearly @xmath209 of the value for @xmath210 constant , while in order to have a further reduction by a factor of @xmath211 one has to take @xmath212 .    .5truecm",
    ".5truecm    we now consider the case where either @xmath213 and @xmath214 or @xmath215 or @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "such values for @xmath11 offer more complexities as not only are there more attractors to consider , but one may have attractors ( pr and nr ) that are destroyed without leaving any trace .",
    "when this happens it is not obvious which persisting attractor will inherit their basins of attraction .",
    "the result of this could cause the final basins of attraction to be drastically different from those for constant @xmath11 and even not monotonically increasing or decreasing as the value of @xmath20 is increased .    in table",
    "[ tap02023 ] we see that initially , for values of @xmath20 not too large , the basin of attraction of fp slightly reduces in size , while those of the rotating solutions pr / nr increase substantially . instead , for larger values of @xmath20 , the basin of attraction of fp increases appreciably , while those of pr / nr increase very slowly .",
    "apparently , the rotating solutions react more quickly as @xmath11 is varied , attracting phase space faster , so that the relative areas of their basins of attraction tend towards the values at @xmath21 for shorter initial times @xmath20",
    ". it would be interesting to study further this phenomenon .",
    "when @xmath24 varies from @xmath210 to @xmath218 and from @xmath219 to @xmath218 , the rotating solutions pr / nr disappear , so that their basins of attractions are absorbed by the persisting attractors . in table",
    "[ tap0202725 ] one sees a very slow movement towards global attraction of the upwards fixed point , which is the only attractor persisting for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the results in table [ tap02302725 ] show that , by taking @xmath20 larger and larger , the relative areas of the basins of attraction of fp and do4 both tend to the values corresponding to @xmath216 ( in particular the basin of attraction of do4 becomes negligible ) .",
    "nearly all trajectories which were converging towards the rotating solutions before the latter disappeared are attracted by the period two oscillations .",
    "this could be due to the fact that do2 is the closest attractor in phase space which persists at both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    .5truecm",
    "however , the more striking feature of figures [ fap0202725 ] and [ fap02302725 ] are the jumps corresponding @xmath221 in the prior and @xmath222 and @xmath223 in the latter .",
    "moreover such jumps are very localised : for instance in figure [ fap02302725 ] for @xmath224 and @xmath208 the basins of attraction of fp and do2 are found to be about @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively , whereas by slightly increasing or decreasing @xmath20 they settle around @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the quantity of phase space exchanged in these instances is roughly equal to that attracted to the rotating solutions for @xmath18 .",
    "for particular values of @xmath20 when the rotating attractors disappear their trajectories move to the upwards fixed point rather than the period 2 oscillations .",
    "the reason for this to happen is not clear .",
    "moreover , note that in principle there could be other jumps , corresponding to values of @xmath37 which have not been investigated : however , it seems hard to make any prediction as far as it remains unclear how the disappearing basins of attractions are absorbed by the persisting ones .    .5truecm",

    "we consider the situation in which the attractor do2 , which has a large basin of attraction for @xmath216 , is no longer present when @xmath24 has reached the final value @xmath230 : as a consequence the trajectories which would be attracted by do2 at @xmath29 end up onto the other attractors : in fact most of them are attracted by the fixed point .    .5truecm",
    ".5truecm    we also notice the interesting features in table [ tap0272502 ] : as the fixed point is the only attractor which exists for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we find that as @xmath20 increases its basin of attraction tends towards 100% , which corresponds to attraction of the entire phase space , up to a zero - measure set .",
    "this happens despite the fact that @xmath24 does not pass through any value for which global attraction to the fixed point is satisfied .",
    "it also suggests that it is possible to provide conditions on the intersection of the two sets @xmath22 and @xmath30 of the attractors corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , in order to obtain that all trajectories move towards the same attractor when the time @xmath20 over which @xmath24 is varied is sufficiently large . in particular",
    ", it is remarkable that it is possible to create an attractor for almost all trajectories by suitably tuning the damping coefficient as a function of time .    in table",
    "[ tap02725023 ] , the relative areas of the rotating solutions , which are absent at @xmath29 , tend to become negligible when @xmath20 is large .",
    "similarly , in table [ tap0302725 ] , the basin of attraction of the period 4 oscillating attractor , which exists only for the final value @xmath19 of the damping coefficient , tends to disappear when @xmath20 is taken large enough .",
    "this confirms the general expectation : the basin of attraction of the disappearing attractor is absorbed by the closer attractor , that is the solution do2 in this case .    .5truecm",
    "the two main numerical methods implemented for the simulations throughout were a variable order adams - bashforth - moulton method and the method of analytic continuation @xcite ; the latter consists in a numerical implementation of the frobenius method . also used to check the results was a runge - kutta method .",
    "the adams - bashforth - moulton integration scheme used is the built in integrator found in matlab , ode113 , whereas the programs based on the method of analytic continuation and runge - kutta scheme were written in c. of the three methods , the slowest was the adams - bashforth - moulton method , however it was found that the method worked well for the system with the chosen parameter values and the results produced were reliable .    both the adams - bashforth - moulton and runge - kutta methods are standard methods for solving odes of this type . when implementing these two integrators to calculate the basins of attraction , two different methods for both choosing initial conditions in phase space and classifying attractors were used .",
    "the first method for picking initial conditions was to take a mesh of equally spaced points in the phase space : this method ensures uniform coverage of the phase space .",
    "when taking this approach a mesh of either 321 141 or 503 289 points was used depending on the desired accuracy .",
    "the second method was to take random initial conditions : this can be done by choosing initial conditions from a stream of random points , which allows the user to use the same random initial conditions in each simulation if required .",
    "this method is often preferred as the accuracy of the estimates of the relative areas of the basins of attraction compared to the number of initial conditions used can be calculated @xcite ; also it is easier to run additional simulations for extra random points to improve estimates later on , when needed . when using random points , the number of points used to calculate the basins of attraction was 300 000 or 400 000 depending on the expected complexity of the system under given parameters .",
    "in some cases where extra accuracy was required due to some attractors having particularly small basins of attraction , additional 200 000 or 300 000 random points were used .",
    "this allowed us to obtain an error less than 0.20 on the relative areas of the basins of attraction .",
    "in the most delicate cases , where more precise estimates were needed to distinguish between values very close to each other ( for instance in table [ table - cubic ] ) , the error was made smaller by increasing the number of points .",
    "we decided to express in all cases the relative areas up to the second decimal digit because often further increasing the number of points did not alter appreciably that digit .    to detect and classify solutions ,",
    "two methods can be used .",
    "the first method consists in finding all attractors as a first step , before computing the corresponding basins of attraction : this required a complete characterisation of both the period and the location in phase space of the attractors . in principle , this works very well , but has the downside of having to find initially all the attractors , and differentiate between those that occupy the same region in phase space . the second method for classifying the solutions was to create a library of solutions .",
    "this was created as the program ran and built up as new solutions were found .",
    "the solution of each integration was then checked against the library and , if not already known , was added . in this way",
    ", the program finds solutions as it goes , so has the advantage of the user not having to know the existing solutions in the system prior to calculating the basins of attraction .",
    "the method of analytic continuation was implemented and produced results very similar to those of the adams - bashforth - moulton method , but in general was much quicker to run .",
    "when implementing this method of integration , we only used random initial conditions in the phase space and the library method for classifying solutions .",
    "the reason for using the adams - bashforth - moulton method , despite being the slowest of the three integrators , was for comparison with the method of analytic continuation .",
    "analytic continuation has not previously been used for numerically integrating an ode of the form , that is an equation with an infinite polynomial nonlinearity that satisfies an addition formula , thus it was good to have a reliable method to check results with . the method for using analytic continuation for integrating ode s that have infinite polynomial nonlinearity that satisfy an addition formula",
    "will be described more extensively in @xcite .",
    "the similarity in results of these completely different methods for integration , initial condition selection and solution classification provides reassurance and confidence that the results produced are accurate .",
    "in this work we have numerically shown the importance of not only the final value of dissipation but its entire time evolution , for understanding the long time behaviour of the pendulum with oscillating support .",
    "this extends the work done in @xcite to a system which , even for values of the parameters in the perturbation regime , exhibits richer and more varied dynamics , due to the presence of the separatrix in the phase space of the unperturbed system .",
    "in addition we have considered also values of the parameters beyond the perturbation regime ( the inverted pendulum ) , where the system can not be considered a perturbation of an integrable one . in particular",
    "this results in a more complicated scenario , with bifurcation phenomena and the appearance of attractors which exist only for values of the damping coefficient @xmath11 in finite intervals away from zero , say @xmath236 $ ] , with @xmath237 .",
    "we have preliminarily studied the behaviour of the system in the case of constant dissipation .",
    "firstly , in the perturbation regime , we have analytically computed to first order the threshold values below which the periodic attractors exist .",
    "we have also discussed why this approach fails due to intrinsic perturbation theory limitations , in particular why the method can not be applied to stable cases of the upwards configuration or to solutions too close to the unperturbed separatrix .",
    "next , we have studied numerically the dependence of the sizes of the basins of attraction on the damping coefficient .",
    "then we have explicitly considered the case of damping coefficient varying monotonically between two values and outlined a few expectations for the way in which the basins of attraction accordingly change with respect to the case of constant dissipation .",
    "these expectations were later illustrated and backed up with numerical simulations : in particular the relevance of the study of the dynamics at constant dissipation was argued at length . while the expectations account for many features observed numerically , there are still some facts which are difficult to explain , even at an heuristic level , and which would deserve further investigation , such as the relationship between the fixed point solution and the oscillating attractors , to better understand why in some cases they exchange large areas of their basins of attraction when the damping coefficient varies in time .",
    "more generally , an in - depth numerical study of the system with constant dissipation , also for other parameter values , would be worthwhile .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to perform a more detailed bifurcation analysis with respect to the parameter @xmath11 and to study the system for very small values of the damping coefficient @xmath11 ( which relates to the spin - orbit model in celestial mechanics ) , both in the perturbation regime and for large values of the forcing amplitude .",
    "we think that , in order to study cases with very small dissipation , the method of analytical continuation briefly described in section [ numericssection ] could be particularly fruitful .",
    "some interesting features appeared in our analysis which would deserve further consideration are :    * the increase in the basin of attraction of the fixed point observed in figure [ fapcfd ] when the damping coefficient becomes small enough ; * the appearance of the period 4 solution for a thin interval of values of the damping coefficient , as emerges in table [ tapcf ] ; * the rate at which the values of the relative areas of the basins attraction corresponding to the initial value @xmath18 of @xmath24 are approached as the variation time @xmath20 increases ; * the way in which the basins of attraction of the disappearing attractors distribute among the persisting ones ; * the oscillations through which the relative areas of the basins of attraction approach the asymptotic value when taking larger and larger values of the variation time @xmath20 , as observed for instance in tables [ tap0202725 ] and [ tap02302725 ] ; * the jumps corresponding to @xmath221 in figure [ fap0202725 ] and @xmath208 , @xmath223 in figure [ fap02302725 ] ; * the computation of the threshold values to second order , so as to include the rotating solutions found numerically in the perturbation regime investigated in section [ pennumericsect ] .",
    "finally , investigating analogous systems such as the pendulum with periodically varying length to see if similar dynamics occur would also be fascinating in its own right .",
    "another interesting model to investigate further , especially in the case of very small dissipation , is the spin - orbit model already considered in @xcite , which is expected to be of relevance to understand the locking into the resonance @xmath238:@xmath239 of the system mercury - sun .",

    "<S> where the systems can be considered as a perturbation of the simple pendulum , which is integrable , we characterise analytically the conditions under which the attractors exist and study numerically how the sizes of their basins of attraction depend on the damping coefficient . away from the perturbation regime , </S>",
    "<S> a numerical study of the attractors and the corresponding basins of attraction for different constant values of the damping coefficient produces a much more involved scenario : changing the magnitude of the dissipation causes some attractors to disappear either leaving no trace or producing new attractors by bifurcation , such as period doubling and saddle - node bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> finally we pass to the case of an initially non - constant damping coefficient , both increasing and decreasing to some finite final value , and we numerically observe the resulting effects on the sizes of the basins of attraction : when the damping coefficient varies slowly from a finite initial value to a different final value , without changing the set of attractors , the slower the variation the closer the sizes of the basins of attraction are to those they have for constant damping coefficient fixed at the initial value . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> if during the variation of the damping coefficient attractors appear or disappear , remarkable additional phenomena may occur . </S>",
    "<S> for instance it can happen that , in the limit of very large variation time , a fixed point asymptotically attracts the entire phase space , up to a zero measure set , even though no attractor with such a property exists for any value of the damping coefficient between the extreme values .    </S>",
