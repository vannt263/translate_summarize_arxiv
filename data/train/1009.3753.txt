    "portfolio optimization is one of the main topics in quantitative finance .",
    "the aim is to maximize investment return while simultaneously minimizing its risk ( see @xcite for a review of the modern portfolio theory ) .",
    "pioneering works on this problem were mainly focused on the mean - variance approach  @xcite where the portfolio variance is minimized under the constraint of a fixed expected return value .",
    "a different approach has been put forward by kelly  @xcite who focused on repeated investments and proposed to maximize the long - term growth rate of the investor s capital .",
    "this so - called growth - optimal or kelly portfolio has been shown to be optimal according to various criteria  @xcite and generalized in different ways .",
    "for example , the question of diversification and constant rebalancing among a certain number of uncorrelated stocks was investigated in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that there is a close connection between the mean - variance approach and the kelly portfolio and that in many cases , the kelly - optimal portfolio includes only a small fraction of the available profitable assets . when investing in games without specified levels of risk and reward ,",
    "the kelly criterion can be merged with bayesian statistical learning as in , for example , @xcite , yielding generalized results for the optimal investment fractions .",
    "stochastic portfolio theory  @xcite is also a descendant of kelly s approach by utilizing on a logarithmic representation of price processes .",
    "application of kelly s optimization process to real stock prices was studied in  @xcite with the conclusion that non - trivial investment ( _ i.e. _ , investing only a part of one s wealth ) occurs rarely .",
    "this is related to the general notion that kelly s portfolio is very aggressive and investment outcomes are sensitive to errors in estimates of assets properties .",
    "modifications such as fractional kelly strategies  @xcite and controlled downturns  @xcite have been consequently proposed to make the resulting portfolios more secure ( these modifications can be of particular importance for risky assets  @xcite ) .",
    "optimization in the long - term can even explain the emergence of cooperation in environments where outcomes of the participants are of multiplicative nature  @xcite .",
    "an interested reader is referred to @xcite for a comprehensive introduction to the kelly portfolio .",
    "kelly s optimization scheme is based on the long - term prospects of the investor and requires continual rebalancing of the portfolio which ensures that the investment fraction is kept constant .",
    "this rebalancing represents the key advantage of the kelly portfolio over the simple buy - and - hold strategy . on the other hand , when non - zero transaction costs are imposed ,",
    "resulting investment performance may deteriorate considerably ( for an example of how the transaction costs influence real traders and their decisions see  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we intend to study the effect of non - zero transaction costs on the kelly portfolio .",
    "we study the situation where portfolio is rebalanced less often ( intermittent rebalancing ) .",
    "our key quantity of interest is the optimal rebalancing period which minimizes the negative effects of transaction fees while maintaining the positive effects of frequent rebalancing .",
    "another reason for intermittent rebalancing is that the distribution of returns may differ from one turn to another .",
    "we approach this problem by postulating a risky asset which evolves on two different time scales and its return distribution hence regularly varies in time .",
    "this setting allows us to study the interplay between the time scales and portfolio rebalancing .",
    "considering a risky asset with a lognormal return distribution allows us to obtain an analytical form for the optimal rebalancing period .",
    "this result is further generalized to other stationary return distributions with finite variance and used to explain some observations made for binary return distributions .",
    "our numerical simulations show that similar behavior can be observed even for returns generated by the standard @xmath4 process where consecutive returns are not independent .",
    "finally , we briefly study partial rebalancing where the investor transfers only a certain part of the required amount between cash and the risky asset .",
    "we show that this strategy can enhance the long - term growth rate more than intermittent rebalancing .",
    "consider a situation where an investor with an initial wealth @xmath5 is allowed to repeatedly invest a fraction @xmath6 of the current wealth to a risky asset while keeping the rest in cash .",
    "we assume that the asset price @xmath7 undergoes a multiplicative stochastic process @xmath8 at discrete time steps @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is a positive parameter ( @xmath13 ) representing the rate of gain or loss of the investment , @xmath14 is the `` winning '' probability and @xmath15 $ ] ( when @xmath16 , the asset is not profitable and it is advisable to refrain from investment ) ; it is assumed that they are both constant and known to the investor . is different from the common one but it will prove very useful in later calculations where it will allow us to obtain approximate results assuming that @xmath17 is small . ]",
    "this `` symmetric '' setting can be easily generalized by assuming distinct rates of gain / loss ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath12 and @xmath18 ) as well as their probabilities ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath17 and @xmath19 ) . to keep the notation simple and to limit the number of parameters to minimum",
    ", we treat only the symmetric case here . by setting @xmath20 ,",
    "one recovers the original kelly game studied in  @xcite .",
    "since asset s properties do not change with time and investor s wealth follows a multiplicative process , the investment fraction set by a rational investor has to be the same in all time steps .",
    "investor s wealth after @xmath21 investment turns is therefore @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the number of `` winning '' and `` loosing '' turns , respectively .",
    "now we can introduce a so - called exponential growth rate of investor s wealth , @xmath25 , which is defined by the relation @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "its limit value has the form @xmath27 one can easily show that for the given model parameters this converges to the unique value @xmath28 in the case of a general risky asset with return distribution @xmath29 , this formula generalizes to the form @xmath30 where the average is over the return distribution @xmath29 .",
    "the long - term profitability of the risky asset can be measured by the average return per time step , @xmath31 . by definition , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "starting from eq .",

    ", increasing @xmath12 enhances the asset s expected return ( when @xmath37 ) but it also increases the magnitude of losses ; overall it leads to a decreased value of @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 which means that the investor is advised to borrow additional money and invest them in the risky asset too .",
    "when @xmath16 ( the asset is not profitable ) , @xmath41 which corresponds to the so - called short selling . for simplicity",
    "we assume that both borrowing and short selling are forbidden and hence @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the requirement of keeping the investment fraction @xmath6 constant implies that the investor needs to constantly rebalance the portfolio : after a `` winning '' turn , some part of wealth has to be moved from the asset to cash and after a `` loosing '' turn , some additional wealth has to be invested in the asset .",
    "this constant portfolio rebalancing may require payment of substantial transaction fees .",
    "the question is , how the fees affect the portfolio optimization process . in particular",
    ", we are interested whether there are situations where the investor fares better with intermittent rebalancing which is sub - optimal from the point of view of the kelly strategy but requires fewer money transfers and hence lowers the transaction fees .",
    "we assume that for any wealth @xmath43 transferred from or to the risky asset , a transaction fee @xmath44 must be paid ( @xmath45 ; the absolute value reflects the fact that transaction fees are paid regardless of the direction of the transfer ) . is asymptotically zero in the long term .",

    "given that the portfolio is properly balanced at a certain moment , the total amount invested in the risky asset is @xmath47 . if the realized return from the risky asset is @xmath48 , the total wealth changes to @xmath49 and the invested amount changes to @xmath50 . if @xmath51 , wealth @xmath52 needs to be transferred from the risky asset to cash to keep the portfolio balanced .",

    "now we know the wealth lost to transaction fees which allows us to write investor s wealth after @xmath21 time steps @xmath61^w \\left[1-fr_1-\\frac{\\alpha r_1f(1-f)}{1-\\alpha(1-f)}\\right]^{n - w}.\\ ] ] this is a generalization of eq .",

    "it is straightforward to use eq .",
    "( [ w_n - fees ] ) to obtain the exponential growth rate @xmath62 and maximize it to get the optimal investment fraction .",
    "since the resulting quadratic equation has complicated coefficients and provides little insights to the behavior of the system , we introduce an approximate approach which will be of great importance in later more complicated cases . we expand @xmath63 in terms of @xmath64 and keep only terms up to order @xmath46 ( this is motivated by the fact that the transaction fee coefficient @xmath46 is nowadays usually small in practice ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath17 and @xmath12 are sufficiently small , we neglect terms that are of the order higher than @xmath65 , @xmath66 , or @xmath67 .",

    "similarly , one can solve the equation @xmath77 to obtain an upper bound for @xmath17 at which the investor is advised to invest all wealth in the asset , @xmath78 which is less than the threshold @xmath79 valid for @xmath71 .",
    "we can conclude that transaction fees narrow the region where non - trivial optimal investment fractions ( @xmath80 ) realize ( this effect is well visible in fig .",

    "another point of view is that transaction fees modify the optimal investment fraction @xmath38 so that the transferred amounts ( which are approximately proportional to @xmath81 ) are lowered .",
    "transaction fees are in this sense similar to friction in mechanics which also both attenuates motion and leads to dissipation of energy ( in the case of transaction fees we face dissipation of wealth ) .      while in the original kelly game the investor should rebalance the portfolio as often as possible ( _ i.e. _ , after each time step ) , in the presence of transaction fees it may be profitable to rebalance the portfolio less often .",

    "this is confirmed by our simulations with returns generated by a @xmath4 process  @xcite with parameters @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 ( these parameter values are similar to those inferred from s&p index data in  @xcite ) .",
    "the optimal rebalancing period  obtained by the same simulation approach as above for the student - based returns  is again proportional to @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : topt2]b ) .",
    "this confirms that our main result is highly robust with respect to the nature of the return distribution .",
    "detailed insights on the degree of dependence at which this scaling breaks down are however yet to come .",
    "so far we only considered mitigating the impact of transaction fees by intermittent rebalancing .",
    "there is another approach , which we call _ partial rebalancing _",
    ", where only part of the required amount is transferred between cash and the asset . the transferred amount required to keep the investment fraction fixed is represented by @xmath43 in eq .  ( [ transfer - basic ] ) .",
    "if only part @xmath230 of the required capital is transferred ( @xmath231 $ ] is a rebalancing parameter ) , @xmath232 steps would be needed to transfer the whole .",
    "hence one can expect that partial rebalancing with @xmath230 should be similar to intermittent rebalancing with period @xmath233 .",
    "since partial rebalancing is parametrized by a continuous parameter @xmath230 , it allows for smoother setting of the portfolio than intermittent rebalancing where the rebalancing period is integer .",
    "when @xmath234 , the desired investment fraction is almost never achieved by partial rebalancing and the actual invested fraction fluctuates around it .",
    "( the smaller the value of @xmath230 , the larger the deviations ; when @xmath235 , the standard rebalancing is recovered and the stake is always adjusted accurately . ) due to these irregularities , partial rebalancing is less accessible to analytical treatment and we present only numerical results here . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : partial ] , the optimal growth rates are achieved for @xmath230 inside the range @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "these rates outperform the optimal values obtained with intermittent rebalancing for both studied values of @xmath46 .",
    "if growth rate improvement is measured in respect to standard rebalancing ( the same as obtained with @xmath235 ) , improvements obtained with partial rebalancing are 23% ( for @xmath237 ) and 18% ( for @xmath238 ) better than those obtained with intermittent rebalancing .",
    "as foreseen above , optimal values of @xmath230 ( @xmath239 and @xmath240 , respectively ) approximately correspond to the optimal periods of intermittent rebalancing ( @xmath241 and @xmath242 , respectively ) .",
    "vs @xmath230 for binary returns with @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "the two thick dotted lines show performance of intermittent rebalancing for @xmath237 , @xmath245 ( upper ) and @xmath238 , @xmath246 ( lower ) , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "while transaction fees represent an important factor limiting investor s profit , in finance literature they are often considered as uninteresting and neglected in order to keep the analysis simple and focused . however , money transfers required by active portfolio optimization strategies may be considerable and the effect of transaction fees significant . in this work we investigated this effect on the growth - optimal / kelly portfolio in detail .",
    "to this end we studied a toy risky asset with a binary return distribution , an asset with time - depending return distribution , and more realistic assets with lognormal and fat - tailed return distributions .",
    "our results show that transaction fees indeed have substantial impact on investment profitability , in particular when the average return of the risky asset is low .",
    "their influence is greatest when the investment fraction is @xmath100 .",
    "this is natural because the wealth volumes transferred in rebalancing are proportional to @xmath247 and hence they are maximized at @xmath248 .",
    "we showed for various settings that when the transaction fee coefficient @xmath46 is sufficiently high , for the investor it may be more profitable to adjust the portfolio less frequently and an optimal rebalancing period @xmath125 arises . in the case of a lognormal distribution of returns ,",
    "the optimal optimal rebalancing period was analytically shown to be proportional to @xmath128 for small @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath46 is small yet @xmath125 is sufficiently long for the central limit theorem to be an appropriate approximation , the optimal rebalancing period scales with @xmath128 for any independent returns drawn from a distribution with finite mean and variance .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm this for binary returns , returns based on student s distribution , and even for returns with memory modeled by a @xmath4 process where the requirement of independence is violated .",
    "we showed that a so - called partial rebalancing can also reduce the impact of transaction fees and hence improve the performance of the kelly strategy .",
    "besides presented results , several research questions remain open .",
    "firstly , while transaction fees are maximized by @xmath248 when investing in one asset , the situation gets more complicated when investment is distributed among several assets .",
    "that situation can be further generalized by assuming correlated asset returns .",
    "secondly , through the paper we have assumed that parameters of the return distribution are known to the investor .",
    "investment optimization hence only consists of choosing the right investment fraction . in real life , the return distribution itself is unknown and its estimation is part of the optimization process . whether the presented results hold also this case is an open question .",
    "finally , results for partial rebalancing presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : partial ] show that this can be a superior approach to the kelly optimization in presence of transaction fees . observed similarity between optimal values of rebalancing parameters @xmath82 and @xmath230 suggests that many of analytical results found here for intermittent rebalancing may hold also for partial rebalancing .",
    "verification of this hypothesis remains as an important challenge for future research .",
