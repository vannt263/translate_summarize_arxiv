    "in this article , we consider the limiting behaviour for a class of stochastic recursions .",
    "these recursions are natural approximations of continuous time stochastic equations .",
    "they arise as models for fast , discretely evolving random phenomena @xcite and also as numerical discretizations of continuous stochastic equations @xcite .",
    "the class is similar to the rough path schemes of @xcite ( see also @xcite , section  8.5 ) , but more general in the sense that the noise driving the recursion is not required to be a rough path , but may be an approximation ( or discretization ) of a rough path .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 is defined by @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "for each @xmath8 , define @xmath9 by the recursion @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are noise sources and we use the notation @xmath13 to denote the matrix inner product .",
    "let @xmath14 be a partition of a finite time interval @xmath15 $ ] , which gets finer as @xmath16 tends to infinity .",
    "the vector @xmath17 should be thought of as an approximation of a random increment @xmath18 where @xmath19 is some given stochastic process ( a semi - martingale or fractional brownian motion , e.g. ) .",
    "formally , the symbol @xmath20 means that the approximation gets better as @xmath16 tends to infinity .",
    "likewise , the matrix @xmath21 should be thought of as some approximation of an iterated stochastic integral @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the outer product and where the notion of stochastic integration ( it , stratonovich or otherwise ) is given .",
    "define the path @xmath24 \\to\\mathbb{r}^e$ ] by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the largest mesh point in @xmath27 with @xmath28 [ note that we could equally define @xmath29 by linear interpolation , without altering the results of the article ] .",
    "our objective is to show that the path @xmath29 converges to the solution of a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) driven by @xmath19 as @xmath16 tends to infinity .    in the case where @xmath30 are the increments of a rough path ,",
    "that is , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the recursions we consider are precisely the rough path schemes defined in @xcite .",
    "however , we only require that @xmath30 be _ approximations _ of rough paths .",
    "this means the class of recursions we consider is much more general than the class of rough path recursions and includes many natural approximations that do not fall under @xcite .",
    "this fact will be illustrated by the examples below .    to see why such diffusion approximations should be possible ,",
    "it is best to look at a few examples .",
    "the most common variant of ( [ erecu ] ) is the `` first - order '' recursion , where @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 this resembles an euler scheme with approximated noise @xmath35 .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to believe that there should be a diffusion approximation @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 denotes weak convergence of random variables ) , where @xmath38 satisfies the sde @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes some method of stochastic integration ( e.g. , it , stratonovich or otherwise ) .",
    "it turns out that the choice of approximating sequence @xmath41 of the increment @xmath42 has a huge influence as to what type of stochastic integral arises in the limit .",
    "we now explore this idea with a few examples .",
    "the first four examples are first - order recursions as in ( [ erec ] ) and the final two are higher order recursions , as in  ( [ erecu ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath43 is a @xmath44-dimensional brownian motion , let @xmath45 and define the partition @xmath27 with @xmath46 .",
    "then clearly @xmath47 defines the usual euler ",
    "maruyama scheme on the time window @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "it is well known that @xmath49 where @xmath38 satisfies the it sde @xmath50 this creates a feeling that any euler looking scheme , like ( [ erec ] ) , should produce it integrals . as we shall see in the next few examples , when some _ correlation _ is introduced to the random variables @xmath41 , this is certainly not the case .",
    "less trivial recursions of the form ( [ erec ] ) have shown up in the areas of population genetics @xcite , econometric models @xcite , psychological learning models @xcite , nonlinear time series models @xcite and mcmc algorithms @xcite , to name but a few . here , we will list the example from @xcite ; our analysis follows that performed in  @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the stochastic difference equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a stationary sequence of random variables with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and with mixing assumptions on the centered sequences @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this recursion arises naturally in models for population growth and also gene selection , where the environment is evolving in a random way .    since the equation ( [ eguess ] )",
    "is linear , the solution can be written down explicitly . as a consequence ,",
    "it is easy to directly identify the limiting behaviour of each term appearing in the solution , for instance with the help of prokhorov s theorem .",
    "alternatively , we can incorporate the problem into the scope of this article by making  ( [ eguess ] ) look more like the recursion ( [ erec ] ) .",
    "we first write @xmath59 now if we replace @xmath60 and @xmath61 by their second - order taylor expansion , we obtain @xmath62 thus , if we set @xmath63 and @xmath64 then @xmath47 satisfies the recursion @xmath65 moreover , due to the assumptions on @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the functional central limit theorem for stationary mixing sequences implies that @xmath68 where @xmath69 are brownian motions with a computable covariance structure .",
    "thus , we should expect a diffusion limit of the form @xmath70 by writing down the solution explicitly , it is shown in @xcite that this is indeed the case and the method of integration involves a correction term that is neither it nor stratonovich .    in nonlinear scenarios ,",
    "more sophisticated machinery is required @xcite , but this still entails quite heavy and often nonrealistic mixing assumptions on the stationary sequence .",
    "the framework of martingale problems @xcite has proved quite suitable for this analysis @xcite . in @xcite , the authors beautifully address the case where the noise is a semi - martingale sequence , using the idea of a _ good _ sequence of semi - martingales .",
    "the following example is taken directly from @xcite .",
    "[ eggood ] let @xmath71 denote the periodic rate of return for a security with value @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that @xmath73 the authors consider the case where @xmath71 is a semi - martingale difference sequence defined in such a way that , if @xmath74 denotes the partial sum process @xmath75 then @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a semi - martingale .",
    "it is natural to expect a diffusion approximation @xmath78 with some undetermined method of integration @xmath79 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a natural condition on @xmath74 that ensures this method of integration is it type , which is clearly the most natural .",
    "sequences @xmath74 that satisfy this condition are called _ good _ semi - martingales .",
    "thus , if @xmath74 is good , then @xmath80 where the integral is of it type .",
    "the authors also permit for a class of semi - martingales which are a reasonable perturbation of a good semi - martingale .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a good sequence of semi - martingales and @xmath83 is a sequence of semi - martingales with @xmath84 as @xmath85 ( hence @xmath86 ) .",
    "now define @xmath87 where the integral is of it type and @xmath88_t$ ] where @xmath89 $ ] denotes quadratic covariation and suppose that @xmath90 as @xmath91",
    ". then @xmath92 where @xmath93 satisfies the it sde @xmath94 so formally speaking , we have @xmath95 .",
    "thus , two equally reasonable approximations of @xmath77 can yield two vastly different limiting diffusions .",
    "this class of perturbed semi - martingales is comprehensive enough to cover virtually every diffusion approximation where the recursion is driven by a semi - martingale sequence .",
    "the next example is a rather important one , which unfortunately does not fit into the classes of diffusion approximations already studied in the literature .",
    "understanding the diffusion approximation for this example is one of the main motivations of this paper .",
    "[ egfastslow ] let @xmath96 describe a chaotic dynamical system with invariant ergodic measure @xmath97 . define the fast  slow system @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the torus @xmath102 and @xmath103 satisfies the centering condition @xmath104 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath105 is a random variable with law @xmath97 , then the path @xmath106 becomes a random variable on cdlg space .",
    "note that the assumption @xmath107 simply means that the chaotic dynamical system is started in stationarity .",
    "fast  slow systems of this type have been considered in @xcite and are fundamental to the understanding of naturally occurring physical systems with separated time scales @xcite .",
    "previous attempts at diffusion approximations typically involve heavy mixing assumption on the dynamical system @xmath108 which are difficult to prove for most reasonable systems @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author develops an alternative it calculus , but only in the case where @xmath108 defines a partially hyperbolic dynamical system . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the special case where the noise is additive .",
    "this allows them to use path - space continuity properties to lift convergence of the partial sum process to convergence of @xmath47 .",
    "let us see how fast  slow systems fit into the recursion framework ( [ erec ] ) .",
    "using a fourier expansion truncated at level @xmath44 , we can replace @xmath109 with the product @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and similarly replace @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath116 this clearly satisfies the recursion ( [ erec ] ) with @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the limiting behaviour of the partial sums @xmath119 is well understood under extremely weak conditions on the dynamical system @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a multiple of brownian motion and @xmath122 .",
    "thus , we would expect a diffusion approximation of the form @xmath123 in the situations that are already understood , namely partially hyperbolic dynamical systems @xcite or additive noise @xcite , the limiting stochastic integral shown to be neither it^ o nor stratonovich type .",
    "thus , the interpretation of the integral in a more general setting is an important problem .",
    "the more general family of recursions defined in ( [ erecu ] ) ( with @xmath124 ) arise when using a second - order approximation . naturally , it is easy to find examples from numerical analysis .",
    "[ egtheta ] let @xmath19 be some stochastic process ( e.g. , fractional brownian motion ) and introduce the shorthand @xmath125 .",
    "suppose we approximate a stochastic equation using a semi - implicit method of integration , for instance , @xmath126 it is easy to show that @xmath47 satisfies ( [ erecu ] ) with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "for a simple stochastic process @xmath19 , like brownian motion , it is well known that the limit of this numerical scheme is @xmath129 where the integral is of stratonovich type .",
    "but for more complicated objects like fractional brownian motion , it is not so simple @xcite .",
    "thus , studying recursions of the type ( [ erecu ] ) can lead to a better understanding well - posedness for numerical schemes , that is , whether they are approximating the correct continuous time limit .",
    "[ egsubdiff ] despite the article s title , its scope is not restricted to diffusions , in particular the results also concern sub - diffusions . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider partial sum processes of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a stationary dependent sequence of random variables and @xmath132 is some normalizing constant , such that @xmath133 in the skorokhod topology , where @xmath19 is fractional brownian motion with some hurst parameter @xmath134 depending on the correlation structure . with this in mind , it is natural to consider a recursion @xmath135 where @xmath21 is some approximation of an iterated integral defined using the sequence @xmath136 .",
    "for instance , as indicated by example  [ egtheta ] , if @xmath137 then the above recursion corresponds to a mid - point rule approximation of a stochastic integral .",
    "in particular one would expect @xmath36 where @xmath138 and where the integral is of _ symmetric _ type @xcite , which is the natural limit of the mid - point scheme .",
    "of course , this is only a guess and it is quite possibly wrong .",
    "as we will see , the tools introduced in this article provide a natural basis for the investigation of such sub - diffusion approximations .",
    "understanding such recursions is vastly important and could facilitate for the design of new methods for simulating stochastic differential equations driven by fractional brownian motion .",
    "the technique employed in this article is similar in spirit to that found in @xcite , in that we will lift an approximation result for the noise signal into diffusion approximation for the recursion .",
    "however , in our more general scenario , where we do not assume any particular probabilistic structure on the noise , we require not just an invariance principle for the noise but also for its _ iterated integral_. more precisely , define the noise signal @xmath139 which is the natural approximation of the limiting noise signal @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , define the discrete iterated integral @xmath140 which is the natural approximation of the limiting iterated integral @xmath141 . in this paper",

    ", this suggest that we can interpret the integral @xmath145 , provided we can identify the limit of the discrete iterated integral @xmath146 to derive this diffusion approximation technique , we use tools from _ rough path theory _ @xcite .      for stochastic differential equations driven by piecewise smooth signals ,",
    "the relationship between the noise and the solution is extremely well understood  mostly thanks to rough path theory .",
    "for the purpose of exposition , suppose that @xmath19 is some piecewise smooth stochastic process and that @xmath38 solves the equation @xmath147 where the integral is defined in the riemann ",
    "stieltjes sense .",
    "it is well known that the map @xmath148 is not continuous in the sup - norm topology .",
    "the theory of rough path proposes that we can build a continuous map from the noise to the solution , provided we know a bit more information about @xmath19 . in particular , suppose that we can define @xmath149 where the integral is again of riemann  stieltjes type .",
    "then one can show that the map @xmath150 is continuous in a topology called the @xmath151 topology ( known colloquially as the _ rough path topology _ ) .",
    "this topology can be thought of as an extension of the @xmath152-hlder topology , defined on the space of objects similar to the pair @xmath153 .",
    "the objects @xmath154 are called rough paths and the metric space of such objects is called the space of @xmath152-hlder rough paths .",
    "this idea clearly has ramifications to the diffusion approximations . indeed , suppose that @xmath47 solves the stochastic equation @xmath155 for some smooth stochastic process @xmath143 and also define the iterated integral @xmath156 . since continuous maps preserve weak convergence , this suggests that a weak limit theorem for the pair @xmath142 in the @xmath151 topology can be lifted to a weak limit theorem for @xmath47 .",

    "show that @xmath157 , where @xmath158 denotes convergence of finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "show that the sequence is tight in the @xmath151 topology .",
    "for instance , one could use a kolmogorov type argument , by checking estimates of the form latexmath:[\\[\\label{eestimates0 } \\bigl ( \\mathbf{e}\\bigl|x^n(s , t)\\bigr|^q \\bigr)^{1/q } \\lesssim|t - s|^\\gamma\\quad \\mbox{and}\\quad \\bigl ( \\mathbf{e}\\bigl| \\mathbb{x}^n(s , t)\\bigr|^{q/2 } \\bigr)^{2/q } \\lesssim    suitable @xmath152 and with @xmath160 large enough .    since the map : _ rough path _",
    "solution _ is continuous in the rough path topology , the conclusion from these two steps is that @xmath36 where @xmath38 is the solution to an sde whose form can be determined by the limit @xmath162 .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath19 were a continuous semi - martingale and that @xmath163 where the above integral is stratonovich type .",
    "then the limiting equation can be written @xmath164 this precise idea has proved useful in the areas of stochastic homogenization @xcite and equations driven by random walks @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for the recursion ( [ erecu ] ) the path @xmath47 does not satisfy a stochastic equation in the sense of rough path theory , so we can not simply apply the above procedure .",
    "the objective of this article is to overcome this obstacle .",
    "it turns out that the same two step procedure defined above , more or less still works .",
    "all we have to do is replace iterated integrals with their discrete counterparts and replace step @xmath165 with the same statement _ up to some resolution_. that is , we need only check the estimates ( [ eestimates0 ] ) for all @xmath166 , which requires no continuity at all . in checking these discrete estimates , we obtain a tightness - like result for a discrete version of the hlder metric , defined ( on cdlg paths ) by @xmath167 this is of course _ always _ finite , since it is a maximum over a finite set , but the tightness result will tell us something about the asymptotics .    at the heart of the proof is an approximation theorem ( theorem  [ thmmod ] ) , which we believe to be useful in its own right .",
    "the theorem allows us to approximate the recursion ( [ erecu ] ) with the solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by piecewise smooth paths .",
    "this approximation theorem can be thought of as a generalization of _ the method of modified equations _ for sdes @xcite ( otherwise known as _",
    "backward error analysis _",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
