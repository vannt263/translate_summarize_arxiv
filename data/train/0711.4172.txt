    "<S> we report on a tunable all - optical delay line for pulses with optical frequency within the rb @xmath0 absorption line . using frequency tuning between absorption components from different isotopes , pulses of 10  ns duration </S>",
    "<S> are delayed in a 10  cm hot vapour cell by up to 40  ns while the transmission remains above 10% . </S>",
    "<S> the use of two isotopes allows the delay to be increased or decreased by optical pumping with a second laser , producing rapid tuning over a range of more than 40% of the initial delay at 110@xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the frequency and intensity ranges in which this delay line can be realised . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are in good agreement with a numerical model of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> ` slow light ' refers to the propagation of a pulse of light in a dispersive medium at a group velocity much less than @xmath2  @xcite . by its use </S>",
    "<S> , optically encoded information can be controllably delayed without the need for electronic transduction . </S>",
    "<S> this is of great interest for telecommunications , where there is a need for tunable all - optical delay lines for high - speed optical signal processing , e.g. , buffering optical data packets  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , such a system may be included in the growing repertoire of tools available for quantum information processing .    </S>",
    "<S> to minimise pulse distortion , an optical delay line should have approximately constant positive dispersion in a spectral region @xmath3 of width larger than the inverse of the pulse duration , i.e. , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission should be high and the fractional delay ( the ratio of the delay @xmath5 to the pulse duration ) , which provides a practical metric , should exceed unity , i.e. , @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> narrow spectral features in the refractive index of atomic media due to light - induced ground - state coherence can result in sub and superluminal pulse propagation  @xcite and even ` light storage '  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using atomic media to produce optical delay has predominantly exploited the steep dispersion associated with electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite . while eit in atomic vapour can produce extremely low group velocities it has a severe bandwidth limitation owing to the narrow spectral range over which the transparency and steep dispersion occurs , making @xmath7 difficult to obtain . because of this , it has been suggested that ultracold atomic samples may be required to achieve large fractional delays in eit - based delay lines  @xcite .    in solid - state media , attempts to obtain larger bandwidth </S>",
    "<S> include methods based on spectral hole burning  @xcite and the use of gain features such as stimulated brillouin scattering  @xcite and raman amplification  @xcite in optical fibres .    </S>",
    "<S> an attractive approach to realising a wide - bandwidth delay line utilises the intrinsic positive dispersion and high transmission between two absorption lines in an atomic vapour . </S>",
    "<S> this has allowed , camacho _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . </S>",
    "<S> _ to observe large fractional delays for light pulses tuned between the @xmath8rb hyperfine components of the @xmath0 line  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this technique provides a high degree of spatial homogeneity in both dispersion and absorption , allowing the delay of transversely encoded optical information ( images )  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the delay and transmission properties of optical pulses tuned within the rb @xmath0 line in a heated vapour with natural isotopic abundance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we modify the dispersion by optical pumping to either reduce or enhance the number of interacting atoms on one of the absorption components , allowing rapid control of the delay .    the scheme of our experimental setup is shown in figure  [ setup]a . </S>",
    "<S> signal and optical pumping radiation is produced using extended cavity diode lasers tuned to the rubidium @xmath0 ( figure  [ setup]b ) and @xmath9 lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the laser frequencies are controlled with reference to doppler - free saturation spectroscopy performed in auxiliary rb cells and the spectral purities are analysed using fabry - perot cavities .    </S>",
    "<S> optical pulses of 9.3  ns duration ( fwhm ) with a repetition rate of 10  mhz are generated from the cw signal laser using an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) triggered by a waveform generator ( figure  [ setup]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical intensity is controlled by a neutral density filter ( nd ) before propagation through a 10  cm vapour cell heated in a thermally insulated oven . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted pulses are detected using a fast photodiode and recorded on an oscilloscope .    </S>",
    "<S> line absorption spectrum at room temperature where the arrow indicates the region of the signal laser frequency used . </S>",
    "<S> , width=604 ]    for rapid tuning of the delay , optical pumping radiation at either the @xmath10rb  ( f=1 ) or ( f=2 ) component of the @xmath9 line is applied , approximately counter - propagating to the signal beam . </S>",
    "<S> a lens minimises spatial deviation of the signal beam induced by optical pumping .    </S>",
    "<S> the signal laser frequency is tuned to the @xmath0  line at @xmath11  nm between the @xmath8rb  ( f=2 ) and @xmath10rb  ( f=1 ) components , which have a separation of @xmath122.5  ghz ( figure  [ setup]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inherent positive dispersion and low absorption in this broad spectral region allows large fractional delays with high transmission . in figure  [ pulsedelays]a </S>",
    "<S> the observed optical delays for pulses at the frequency of peak transmission are shown relative to a non - interacting reference pulse for temperatures between 105@xmath1c and 135@xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> a fractional delay @xmath13 was observed for a transmission of 9% with good pulse shape preservation , where the pulse duration narrowed by less than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the fractional delay is limited in these experiments by the pulse duration we are able to generate . the observed delay and transmission </S>",
    "<S> are plotted against temperature in figure  [ pulsedelays]b , along with our numerical predictions .    for our numerical predictions , we model the absorption coefficient @xmath14 and the real part of the refractive index @xmath15 of the rb @xmath0  line using a convolution of profiles arising from homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the homogeneous profile includes contributions from natural broadening , collisional broadening  @xcite and power broadening and is convolved with the thermal gaussian doppler profile . </S>",
    "<S> the group velocity is then approximated using the first derivative of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath16 , @xmath17    at the frequency of peak transmission between the two absorption lines , the probability for resonant interaction via the doppler shift is small , even at the temperatures used in these experiments . </S>",
    "<S> instead , interaction occurs mainly through the broad wings of the homogeneous component of the profile . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath18c the probability of an atom belonging to a velocity class with a detuning of 1  ghz from resonance and an optical bandwidth of 110  mhz ( appropriate for our pulse duration ) is about @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> using an estimated number density of @xmath20 @xmath21 ( based on ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and taking into account the natural isotopic ratio ) , the optical depth @xmath22 is 0.4 for a 10  cm cell .    ) and delay ( @xmath23 ) with numerical predictions ( curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=15 ]    our pulse bandwidth of @xmath24  mhz is less than the width of the transmission window of approximately 1  ghz which allows the variation in @xmath25 and @xmath14 between the absorption components to be explored . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependence of the pulse delay and transmission at different temperatures is shown in figure  [ freqtuning ] . for 10% transmission , suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as a practical limit for a delay line , the usable bandwidth decreases from 1.1  ghz at @xmath26c to 540  mhz at @xmath27c . at the former temperature </S>",
    "<S> we expect that a fractional delay an order of magnitude larger could be achieved with shorter pulses that utilise the available bandwidth .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of saturation is quantified in our numerical model by the saturation parameter @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the saturation intensity which is inversely proportional to the frequency dependent absorption cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this means saturation has little effect on the wings of a homogeneously broadened line . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for an inhomogeneously broadened line , saturation can occur over the entire profile . </S>",
    "<S> this means that although increasing the temperature decreases the usable bandwidth due to doppler broadening ( figure  [ freqtuning ] ) , at a given temperature the bandwidth may be increased by increasing the saturation .    </S>",
    "<S> rb  ( f=2 ) component . </S>",
    "<S> the points are experimental observations and the solid curves are our numerical predictions for transmission . the saturation parameter @xmath30  20 , 8 and 4 for @xmath31  127 , 120 and 110@xmath1c , respectively . interpolations ( dashed ) are included as a guide to the eye for the delay . </S>",
    "<S> , width=453 ]    expression ( [ vg ] ) for @xmath32 provides an accurate approximation for the delay at frequencies near the point of peak transmission . </S>",
    "<S> however , the agreement is found to reduce for frequencies closer to the absorption peaks </S>",
    "<S> . this may be due to higher spectral derivatives in @xmath15 becoming more significant . </S>",
    "<S> it was observed that the pulse shape suffers little distortion from dispersive and absorptive mechanisms and remains preserved . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the finding in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that these mechanisms compensate one another .    rb  ( f=1 ) ground state , respectively . , </S>",
    "<S> width=9 ]    c , where the small and large beam diameters used were 1 and 3  mm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> , width=566 ]    temperature tuning provides a method for changing the delay over a wide range , but the change is inherently slow as the cell heats or cools . </S>",
    "<S> fast control of the delay was achieved in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by using two additional laser fields to modify the dispersion by saturating both absorption lines to reduce the atomic ground state population . </S>",
    "<S> while this approach gives rapid delay tunability , it produces a relatively small tuning range . in the present work , where the pulses are tuned between absorption resonances from different isotopes , </S>",
    "<S> hyperfine optical pumping allows the ground state population of one of the resonances to be strongly modified with minimal modification of the other . </S>",
    "<S> an optical pumping laser tuned to one of the @xmath10rb components of the @xmath9 line is used to modify the population of @xmath10rb  ( f=1 ) ground state atoms interacting with the signal . </S>",
    "<S> tuning the optical pumping laser to the @xmath9 @xmath10rb  ( f=1 ) or ( f=2 ) component respectively reduces or increases the population in the f=1 ground state ( figure  [ pumping]b  and  c ) . </S>",
    "<S> pumping on the @xmath9 line is more efficient than on the @xmath0 line as it has no cycling transition . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the optical depth is less both for this line and for the @xmath10rb component , giving greater longitudinal pumping homogeneity . in this manner , at @xmath26c the delay was reduced by approximately 17.5% or increased by 25% of the unmodified delay ( figure  [ pumping]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the delay reconfiguration time is mainly limited by atomic time of flight , which is expected to be of the order of microseconds . a range of delay tuning greater than the pulse duration should be possible with shorter pulses .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the delay of optical pulses with very low intensity have previously been performed with an average of less than one photon per pulse  @xcite . in this work however , we are interested in establishing high intensity limits , which we do by using both positive and negative pulse shapes ( figure  [ intensity]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a negative pulse shape is an interval of reduced intensity on a relatively large optical dc background . </S>",
    "<S> negative pulse shapes are found to exhibit similar delay to positive pulses of comparable intensity , and they may be useful for other applications in that the signal to noise ratio can be higher . furthermore , such pulses may be of interest in experiments involving atomic or optical coherence . by neutral density filtering and adjusting the beam waist , </S>",
    "<S> the delay was measured for a range of values of the intensity of the 10  mhz pulse train ( figure  [ intensity]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the delay decreases with increasing intensity by approximately 1.8  ps/(mw/@xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the increase in saturation of the atomic medium , which has the effect of reducing the dispersion .    in conclusion , optical pulses of 9.3  ns duration ( fwhm ) with frequency tuned between the @xmath8rb  ( f=2 ) and @xmath10rb  ( f=1 ) components of the @xmath0 line </S>",
    "<S> were delayed in a 10  cm vapour cell at @xmath34c with low distortion by more than 40  ns ( fractional delay 4.3 ) and with approximately 10% transmission . </S>",
    "<S> the delay arises from the intrinsic positive dispersion between the two absorption peaks . in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> the fractional delay was limited by the pulse duration , but should be ultimately limited by the @xmath121  ghz transmission window , making a fractional delay of 40 possible .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of delay , transmission and usable bandwidth with temperature and frequency was investigated . with increasing temperature and atomic density the delay increases and </S>",
    "<S> the transmission reduces . </S>",
    "<S> this trend also applies as the optical frequency is tuned closer to one of the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> a reduction in usable bandwidth was measured with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the delay was found to reduce with increasing intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this was observed using negative pulses , which were delayed in a similar manner to positive pulses .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to eit - based delay lines this technique provides the large bandwidth necessary for delaying short optical pulses and also operates at both low and high intensity levels .    </S>",
    "<S> using the spectral region between absorption components of different isotopes for an all - optical delay line allows optical pumping with a single laser to modify the interacting population of one absorption component without modifying the other . </S>",
    "<S> rapid tuning of the delay was obtained in this way over a range more than 40% of the unmodified pulse delay at @xmath26c .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that such broadband delay lines may be used to delay many forms of optical quantum information encoding such as weak coherent pulses or squeezed states . </S>"
