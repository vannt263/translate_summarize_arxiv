    "the theory of conductance in mesoscopic electronics was developed some years ago by buttiker , following upon earlier ideas of landauer@xcite .",
    "the conductance of a mesoscopic system is given in terms of the scattering within and between quantum channels and involves the transmission and reflection coefficients as well as the thermal occupation of reservoirs feeding or draining those channels . the theory makes direct contact with measured currents through averages of quadratic functions of fermi field operators in the channels .",
    "the computation of the scattering matrices depends on the nature of the systems connected to the reservoirs , which could be a simple tunnel barrier or an array of coherently coupled quantum dots . in the buttiker approach",
    "once the scattering matrices are calculated we do not need to refer to the dynamics of any local systems to which the input and output channels are coupled .",
    "in many ways this theory is a fermion analogue of the quantum description of optical fields interacting with an optical cavity under the markov approximation .",
    "such systems are described by the input / output theory of collett and gardiner@xcite .",
    "the properties of the fields outside the cavity are determined by a scattering matrix connecting the input and output fields to the cavity and the dynamics inside the cavity .",
    "the input / output theory for optical fields has been shown to be an example of the quantum stochastic calculus for boson fields@xcite .",
    "the buttiker approach is particularly useful in determining measured properties of the mesoscopic system , such as conductance .",
    "however recent interest in coherently coupled quantum dots for quantum computation@xcite has focussed attention on the dynamics of localised systems , such as quasibound states on quantum dots , rather than the transport through input and output channels . in the input / output theory of quantum optics ,",
    "the dynamics of the local system is described through a markov master equation , and there is a consistency between a description entirely in terms of the input and output modes and the irreversible dynamics of the local system to which they couple . in this paper",
    "we establish the connection between a description in terms of input and output channels and the irreversible dynamics of a localised quasibound state on a single quantum dot .",
    "the analysis is easily extended to more complex local systems .",
    "this enables us to make a connection between two very successful theories , quantum optics and quantum mesoscopics , for the treatment of quantum stochastic processes .",
    "we expect that analogies between quantum optics and mesoscopic electronics will prove useful as the latter explores the physics of strong coherent coupling between local systems ( eg quantum dots@xcite ) , quantum limited measurements ( eg . using single electronics@xcite ) , and proposals for quantum computation@xcite .",
    "our treatment will be based on a particularly simple system ; a single quantum dot coupled to two quantum channels , see figure [ fig1 ] , as this system is the electronic analogue of a single fabry - perot cavity in quantum optics .",
    "the conductance properties of this system can easily be obtained by the method of buttiker@xcite . recently",
    "a similar result was obtained using a markov master equation description of the quasibound state of the dot@xcite . in this paper",
    "we give an equivalent description in terms of the quantum stochastic calculus for fermi fields .",
    "the free hamiltonian for a fermion channel is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a fermi annihilation operator satisfying the anti commutation relations @xmath2 we now define the fermi field operator @xmath3 which represents free field dynamics with respect to a frame rotating at frequency @xmath4 .",
    "this frequency will later be taken to characterise the energy of the quasi bound state to which the fermi field is coupled .",
    "the field operator satisfies the continuum anti commutation relations @xmath5 our objective is to define a quantum stochastic process to accurately characterise the fermi statistics of these fields . to that end",
    "we define the integrated operators , @xmath6 and the corresponding ito increment @xmath7 we now need to specify the state of the free fields .",
    "we will take these to be thermal equilibrium states of a noninteracting fermi system at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "it is then easy to show , under appropriate assumptions that @xmath9 where the equilibrium occupation probability @xmath10 is evaluated at the reference energy @xmath11 .",
    "later this will be the probability that a free field fermi state , resonant with quasi bound state , is occupied .",
    "the important point to note here is that these quantities , while quadratic in the field increments , are only first order in the time increment . this is a quantum analogue of the classical wiener stochastic process@xcite .",
    "stochastic integrals of averaged field operators are found using a generalisation of the ito calculus for classical stochastic processes@xcite . in particular",
    "we have , @xmath12 where @xmath13 may be operator valued functions .",
    "we also note that in the ito calculus the chain rule is modified according to@xcite @xmath14 the final term must be included to ensure a correct expansion to linear order in the time increment .",
    "we need now to specify how the free field is coupled to a local electronic degree of freedom described by the fermi annihilation and creation operators @xmath15 .",
    "this degree of freedom could for example be a quasi bound state of a single quantum dot or donor atom .",
    "this interaction will be taken to be linear in the system operators .",
    "the usual tunnelling interaction is then specified by the hamiltonian , @xmath16 such a coupling is the usual way to describe tunnel coupling between a reservoir and a localised degree of freedom@xcite we now anticipate the markov approximation by assuming that around the reference energy , the coupling constants , @xmath17 are very slowly varying functions of @xmath18 and replace them by a constant , @xmath19 . for further discussion see@xcite . @xmath20",
    "the time evolution operator over the time increment @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 this enables us to define the output field stochastic process as @xmath23 this equation suggests that we regard @xmath24 as the input field stochastic process @xmath25 .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath26 this expression may be written directly in terms of the reservoir field operators as @xmath27 this expression can be used to establish a connection between input and output fields once the dynamics of the local system operators is given . in the frequency ( energy )",
    "domain the resulting expression is equivalent to the scattering matrix in the method of buttiker",
    ".    the dynamics of the local system is specified by a quantum stochastic differential equation , for example @xmath28 where the noise operators are @xmath29 it is at this point that we recognise the difference between fermi and bose quantum stochastic calculus . in the bose case",
    "the noise operator does not depend on system operators , and is in fact simply given by @xmath24 , as the commutator in eq [ sde ] is unity . in the fermi case",
    "however _ the noise depends on the system operators_. this will ensure that the dynamics of the local system reflects fermi statistics , in particular it will ensure that the stochastic differential equation for the number operator @xmath30 takes the correct form .",
    "despite the fact that the noise operators depend on the system operators , the average over quadratic combinations do not depend on the system .",
    "this is because the system operator appearing in eq([sde ] ) has only two eigenvlaues @xmath31 , which when squared is unity .",
    "thus we find @xmath32    the quantum stochastic differential equation for the system number operator is given by @xmath33 where the noise operator is @xmath34 equation [ num - qsde ] correctly reflects the fermi statistics of the local system .",
    "if the ito correction term , @xmath35 had been neglected , this would not have occurred . when this term is evaluated , the dependence of the noise operators on system variables in eq .",
    "[ sde ] is crucial . as a result",
    "the average occupation of the local system in the steady state is given correctly by @xmath36 as would be expected for a fermi particle .",
    "we can also obtain the master equation for the local system by @xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the state of the total system ( localised system and the external fields ) , and trace refers to a trace over external field variables . using the noise moments we find , @xmath39+\\gamma f(\\omega_0)(2c^\\dagger\\rho c - cc^\\dagger\\rho(t)-\\rho(t)cc^\\dagger)\\\\ \\nonumber & & \\mbox{}+\\gamma(1- f(\\omega_0))(2c\\rho c^\\dagger - c^\\dagger c\\rho(t)-\\rho(t)c^\\dagger c)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is an easy matter to verify that the mean occupation of the dot @xmath40 obeys the same equation that results from taking moments of both sides of eq .",
    "[ num - qsde ] .",
    "the master equation represents the schrdinger picture dynamics , while the quantum stochastic differential represents the heisenberg picture .",
    "the system we will discuss in this paper is a standard mesoscopic configuration@xcite in which ohmic contacts couple to propagating channels to either side of a quantum dot ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we suppose that there is a single quasi bound state between two tunnel barriers .",
    "spin will be ignored .",
    "it can easily be included as another state in the dot .",
    "we will also ignore coulomb blockade , which for a single bound state simply leads to a shift in the energy of the state .",
    "we also take the so called zero - temperature limit , and assume that the bound state energy is below the effective fermi energy in the source ( l , in figure [ fig1 ] ) and above the effective fermi energy in the drain ( r in figure [ fig1 ] ) . the ohmic contact at the left of the dot is assumed to be a perfect emitter while the ohmic contact at the right of the dot is a perfect absorber .",
    "this ensures that both reservoirs will remain close to thermal equilibrium at all times , provided they are connected to an external emf .",
    "these assumptions will be important when we consider the measured quantities in this system .",
    "we need now to specify how the free fields in the left and right channels are coupled to a local electronic degree of freedom described by the fermi annihilation and creation operators @xmath15 .",
    "this degree of freedom could for example be a quasi bound state of a single quantum dot or donor atom .",
    "this interaction will be taken to be linear in the system operators .",
    "the usual tunnelling interaction , anticipating the markov approximation as in the previous section , is then specified by the hamiltonian , @xmath41 where @xmath42 refers to the tunnelling rate across the left and right barrier respectively , while @xmath43 are the fermi fields in the left channel and right channel respectively .",
    "the corresponding unitary evolution operator for a time increment @xmath21 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the quantum stochastic processes in the left and right channels respectively .",
    "the input / output relations are then found to be @xmath46 with the following averages for the noise @xmath47 all other averages are zero .",
    "alternatively we may write the input - output relations as @xmath48    the quantum stochastic differential equation for the destruction operator in the dot is , @xmath49 the quantum stochastic differential equation for the number operator on the dot is @xmath50 if we take moments of both sides of eq.[dot - qsde ] we find , @xmath51 the first term corresponds to injection from the source onto the dot .",
    "this term is zero if the dot is already occupied and @xmath52 .",
    "the second term correspond to emission from the dot through the right barrier into the drain .",
    "the steady state occupation number on the dot is @xmath53 the master equation for the dot is found to be @xmath54 this equation was previously derived by more direct methods in reference @xcite .",
    "it is at this point we need to make contact with measurable quantities . in the case of electron transport",
    ", the measurable quantities reduce to current @xmath55 and voltage @xmath56 .",
    "the measurement results are a time series of currents and voltages which exhibit both systematic and stochastic components .",
    "thus @xmath55 and voltage @xmath56 are classical conditional stochastic processes , conditioned by the underlying quantum dynamics of the quasi bound state on the dot .",
    "the reservoirs in the ohmic contacts play a key role in defining the measured quantities and ensuring that they are ultimately classical stochastic processes .",
    "transport through the dot results in charge fluctuations in either the left or the right channels .",
    "these fluctuations decay extremely rapidly , ensuring that the channels remain in thermal equilibrium with the respective ohmic contacts . for",
    "this to be possible charge must be able to flow into and out of the channels from an external circuit .",
    "we assume that a constant potential difference is maintained between the two reservoirs either side of the dot . while the entire system is clearly not in thermal equilibrium , we assume that the left and right channels are themselves close to thermal equilibrium and can each be specified by a separate chemical potential @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and these are held constant by a external voltage source , @xmath59 .    if a single electron tunnels out of the dot into the right channel between time @xmath60 and @xmath61 , its energy is momentarily above the fermi energy .",
    "this electron scatters very strongly from the electrons in that channel and propagates into the right ohmic contact where it is perfectly absorbed .",
    "the net effect is a small current pulse , @xmath62 in the external circuit .",
    "this is completely analogous to perfect photodetection : a photon emitted from a cavity will be detected with certainty by a detector which is a perfect absorber .",
    "likewise when an electron in the right channel tunnels onto the dot , there is a rapid relaxation of this unfilled state back to thermal equilibrium as an electron is emitted from the right ohmic contact into the depleted channel .",
    "this again results in a current pulse in the circuit connected to the ohmic contacts .",
    "the energy gained when one electron is emitted from the left reservoir is , by definition , the chemical potential of that reservoir , @xmath57 while the energy lost when one electron is absorbed into the right reservoir is @xmath58 .",
    "the net energy transferred between reservoirs is @xmath63 .",
    "this energy is supplied by the external emf , @xmath59 and thus @xmath64 .",
    "it should not be supposed that the electron injected from the left contact and emitted into the right contact have the same energy as the energy of an electron on the dot .",
    "in fact any electron energy at all will suffice to restore thermal equilibrium in the left and right leads .",
    "if an electron is emitted into the left channel between times @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the ( unnormalised ) sate of that channel is @xmath65 .",
    "the probability of this event occurring is simply the normalisation constant and is @xmath66 .",
    "that is to say the probability of emission of electrons into the left channel is determined by the _",
    "anti normally ordered _ number flux operator in the left channel .",
    "a similar argument indicates that the probability of absorption of an electron in the right ohmic contact is given by the mean of the _ normally ordered _ number flux operator in the right most channel , @xmath67 .",
    "this is precisely analogous to perfect photodetection from an optical source@xcite .",
    "both the emission into the left channel and absorption from the right channel are conditional point processes , conditioned on the quantum state of the quasi bound state on the dot .    on average of course the same current flows in both reservoirs",
    ", however as the current is stochastic it is made up of contributions from pulses in each lead , which do not necessarily occur at the same time . indeed they are necessarily separated in time by a degree depending on the life time of the quasi bound state in the dot . in mesoscopic devices",
    "however current in measured locally in each lead , thus we can consider either the current in the left lead , @xmath68 or the current in the right lead @xmath69 and correlations between them .",
    "the current that flows in the right lead is simply given by the probability per unit time that an electron in that channel is absorbed by the perfect absorber that is the right ohmic contact .",
    "thus @xmath70 the average current that flows in the left lead is given by the average probability per unit time that an electron is emitted by the perfect emitter that is the left ohmic contact .",
    "@xmath71 note that the average on the left hand side is an average of a classical stochastic process , while the average on the right is of a quantum stochastic process .",
    "we may now substitute the relationship between the output fields , the input fields and the operator for the local state , eqs(37,38 ) .",
    "the average currents are then found to be @xmath72 in the stationary state both currents are equal and given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 .    the stationary two time correlation matrix is given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 is determined by the appropriately ordered two time correlation function for the quantum fields in the channels . as both emission and absorption are point processes we find , @xmath78    using equations 37 and 38 , the steady state @xmath79 ) field correlation functions may be expressed solely in terms of the correlation functions for the quasibound state as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the steady state solution to the master equation , eq [ master_eq ] for the quasi bound state on the dot .    upon solving the master equation we may evaluate each correlation function to give ; @xmath82 where @xmath74 .",
    "the power spectrum of the noise in either the left or the right lead is then given by the fourier transform of the current correlation function in either lead @xmath83 note that at zero frequency and symmetric rates ( @xmath84 ) the current noise is suppressed by a factor of 0.5 over shot noise .",
    "this is the same as that obtained by buttiker@xcite , and is equivalent to that obtained in reference @xcite .",
    "note however that in that paper it was assumed , following earlier work@xcite , that the measured current is a superposition of the two poisson processes of emission and absorption .",
    "this however is not the case for mesoscopic measurements .",
    "as has been stressed by buttiker , the current is measured in one lead at a time and thus the correct expression for the current noise is that given above .",
    "in this paper we have shown an equivalence between the approach of buttiker and the approach of quantum stochastic calculus to the current through mesoscopic systems . to illustrate the equivalence we have discussed the current fluctuations in two terminal mesoscopic circuit with two tunnel barriers containing a single quasi bound state on the well .",
    "the method enables us to focus on either the incoming and outgoing fermi fields in the leads , or on the irreversible dynamics of the well state itself .",
    "we have of course made the markov approximation in order to obtain the quantum langevin equations for the system .",
    "the markov assumption is equivalent to the assumption of the breit - wigner ( lorentzian ) assumption for the transmission coefficients though a double barrier structure , and is discussed in some detail in reference @xcite .",
    "we believe there are two advantages in our approach .",
    "firstly it is useful to be able to refer to the quantum irreversible dynamics of the quasi bound states on local systems defined by barriers , as well as the input and output fermi fields .",
    "this is particularly important in coherently coupled quasibound states .",
    "this is essential for recent condensed matter schemes for quantum computation , where the focus is not so much on the properties of the external , classical currents but rather on the dynamics of the local systems themselves .",
    "secondly , our method parallels a similar approach to strongly coupled field modes in quantum optics , thus suggesting useful directions for future work .",
    "we mention one such direction . in quantum optics",
    "the method of quantum trajectories@xcite enables a description to be given of quantum limited measurement@xcite , quantum control ( feedback and feed forward)@xcite , and cascaded local systems ( irreversible but directional coupling)@xcite .",
    "as mesoscopic technology advances these topics will become increasingly important .",
    "the presentation in this paper shows how the quantum stochastic methods of quantum optics may be taken over to fermi systems .",
