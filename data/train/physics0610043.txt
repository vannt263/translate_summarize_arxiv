    "the topic of invisibility    which is a very old one in optics and electromagnetics ( wolf & habashy 1993 )    has lately acquired a new lease of life with the advent of metamaterials ( fedotov , mladyonov , prosvirnin & zheludev 2005 ; al & engheta 2006 ) . in a similar vein , it has recently been proposed that the exotic electromagnetic possibilities offered by metamaterials may be harnessed to achieve cloaking , at least in principle ( leonhardt 2006 ; milton & nicorovici 2006 ; pendry , schurig & smith 2006 ) .",
    "the theoretical arguments underlying this proposed cloaking are based on the facilitation of coordinate transformations by nonhomogeneous metamaterials .",
    "a quite different approach to concealing a material is pursued in this paper .",
    "it is based on the perceived deflection of light by a material slab translating at constant velocity .",
    "no special material properties are required , but for illustrative purposes , we consider an isotropic , homogeneous , dielectric material . in two previous studies , we have demonstrated that the much  heralded negative  phase  velocity phenomenon often associated with negatively refracting electromagnetic metamaterials can be realized by conventional materials through the process of uniform motion ( mackay & lakhtakia 2004 , 2006a ) . here",
    ", we demonstrate that a substantial degree of concealment may also be realized by uniform motion .",
    "as regards notational matters , 3 vectors are in boldface , with the @xmath2 symbol identifying unit vectors .",
    "double underlining signifies a 3@xmath33 dyadic and @xmath4 is the identity 3@xmath33 dyadic .",
    "the superscript @xmath5 denotes the transpose of a column vector .",
    "the permittivity and permeability of vacuum are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the vacuum wavenumber is @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the angular frequency , and the vacuum wavelength is @xmath10 .",
    "pw_section    as a preliminary to concealment of a moving slab (  [ beam_section ] ) , let us consider a uniformly moving half  space .",
    "suppose that a plane wave is launched with wavevector @xmath11 from vacuum ( @xmath12 ) towards the half ",
    "space @xmath13 occupied by an isotropic , nondissipative , dielectric material .",
    "this material moves at constant velocity @xmath14 , parallel to the interface and in the plane of incidence . in an inertial frame of reference that moves with the same velocity @xmath15 with respect to the laboratory frame of reference wherein @xmath16 is specified , the refracting material is characterized by relative permittivity @xmath17 .",
    "the minkowski constitutive relations of the moving half  space in the laboratory frame of reference are ( chen 1983 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 & \\#m = m \\hat{\\#v}\\ , ,   \\quad \\displaystyle { m= \\frac{\\beta \\le \\eps_r - 1 \\ri}{1 - \\eps_r \\beta^2}}\\ , , & \\beta = v \\sqrt{\\epso \\muo}\\ , \\end{array } \\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] in order to exclude the possibility of evanescent plane waves , @xmath20 is assumed .",
    "the envisaged scenario is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the angle @xmath21 between the refracted wavevector @xmath22 , as observed from the laboratory frame of reference , and the unit vector @xmath23 normal to the interface is related to the angle of incidence @xmath24 by ( chen 1983 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the wavenumber of the refracted wave and @xmath27 . since @xmath28 , refraction is positive @xmath29 ( mackay & lakhtakia 2006b ) .",
    "the time  averaged poynting vector of the refracted plane wave is given by ( chen 1983 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants , and the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath33 is @xmath34 as an illustrative example , the angle @xmath35 is plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] against @xmath36 for @xmath37 , for the half ",
    "space characterized by @xmath38 .",
    "the orientation of the refracted time ",
    "averaged poynting vector rotates towards the direction of motion as @xmath39 increases from @xmath40 .",
    "the counterposition regime    which occurs where @xmath41 for @xmath42    is discussed elsewhere ( lakhtakia & mccall 2004 ; mackay & lakhtakia 2006b ) .    in connection with figure  [ fig2 ] ,",
    "it is of particular interest here that @xmath43 at ( i ) @xmath44 for @xmath45 , ( ii ) @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and ( iii ) @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "that is , there exist angles of incidence at which the time  averaged poynting vector is not deflected by the uniformly moving half  space .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible for a light beam    not to be confused with a plane wave    to pass through a uniformly moving slab at an oblique angle without experiencing a lateral shift in position .",
    "that suggestion inspired the research presented in the next section .",
    "beam_section    suppose that the uniformly moving half  space considered in  [ pw_section ] is now replaced by a slab of thickness @xmath50 moving at constant velocity @xmath51 parallel to its two surfaces , as schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the slab    which is characterized , as before , by @xmath20 in a co  moving reference frame    is immersed in vacuum .    a 2d beam with electric field phasor ( haus 1984 ) @xmath52 is incident upon the slab at a mean angle @xmath53 relative to the slab normal direction @xmath54 .",
    "the beam is represented as an angular spectrum of plane waves , with @xmath55 being the wavevector of each planewave contributor .",
    "the angular  spectral function @xmath56 is taken to have the gaussian form ( haus 1984 ) @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the width of the beam waist .",
    "two polarization states are considered : parallel to the plane of incidence , i.e. , @xmath59 and perpendicular to the plane of incidence , i.e. , @xmath60    the electric field phasor of the reflected beam is given as @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 & \\mbox{for } & \\#e_i ( \\vartheta ) = \\#e_\\parallel \\vspace{4pt }   \\\\",

    "in view of figure  [ fig2 ] , we fixed the mean angle of incidence of the beam at @xmath69 and explored the behaviour of the transmitted beam for @xmath70 , @xmath46 and @xmath71 .",
    "the energy density of the beam in both half  spaces , as measured by @xmath72 is mapped for @xmath73 and @xmath74 in figure  [ fig4 ] with the slab thickness @xmath75 .",
    "the restriction @xmath76 $ ] was imposed to exclude evanescence .",
    "a beam waist of @xmath77 was selected for all calculations .",
    "we considered @xmath78 for both @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "regardless of the polarization state , the transmitted beam does not undergo a lateral shift ( relative to the incident beam ) when @xmath46 .",
    "however , the transmitted beam is laterally shifted in the direction of @xmath81 when @xmath70 and in the direction of @xmath82 when @xmath83 . the energy densities of the reflected and transmitted beams are sensitive to @xmath39 and the polarization state of the incident beam .",
    "a more quantitative representation of the transmitted beam is provided in figure  [ fig5 ] , wherein @xmath84 is plotted against @xmath85 for @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "for comparison , @xmath84 for the beam in the absence of the moving slab is also plotted .",
    "it is clear that the beam position for @xmath46 coincides with the beam position in the absence of the moving slab . at @xmath46 ,",
    "the peak energy density of the transmitted beam for the case of parallel polarization is approximately 11@xmath88 less than it would be if the slab were absent ; the corresponding figure for perpendicular polarization is @xmath89 .",
    "the median shift of transmitted beam in relation to the incident beam is defined as @xmath90 for both parallel and perpendicular polarizations , @xmath91 is plotted against @xmath36 in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "thus , regardless of the polarization state , the beam can be shifted laterally along @xmath92 by means of uniform motion . in particular , the zero beam shift at @xmath46 is further confirmed in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "our numerical investigations show that a 2d beam can pass obliquely through a uniformly moving slab without undergoing a lateral shift in its position . at a fixed angle of beam incidence ,",
    "this effect occurs only for a unique translational slab velocity .",
    "however , extrapolating from figure  [ fig2 ] , for every angle of beam incidence a slab velocity can be found at which the beam undergoes no lateral shift .",
    "furthermore , for a fixed angle of incidence , a pulsed beam will undergo zero lateral deflection , provided that the constitutive parameters do not vary with angular frequency in the pulse spectrum .",
    "the degree of concealment achieved by uniform motion is not 100@xmath88 due to reflections but , in the particular case of the example considered in",
    " [ beam_section ] , almost 90@xmath88 of the peak energy density of the beam can be transmitted without deflection .",

    "the reflection coefficients @xmath67 and transmission coefficients @xmath68 are straightforwardly calculated by solving the reflection ",
    "transmission problem as a boundary value problem .",
    "we outline the procedure here , further details being available elsewhere ( lakhtakia & messier 2005 ) .",
    "consider the plane wave with electric and magnetic field phasors @xmath93 propagating in the @xmath94 plane .",
    "as in  [ beam_section ] , a moving slab described by the minkowski constitutive relations occupies the region between @xmath95 and @xmath96 ; elsewhere there is vacuum .",
    "we write @xmath97 substitution of equations and into the source  free maxwell curl postulates @xmath98 delivers four differential equations and two algebraic equations .",
    "the latter two equations are easily solved for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thereby , the four differential equations may be expressed in matrix form as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a column vector and @xmath103 is a 4@xmath34 matrix with @xmath104 the solution to is conveniently expressed as @xmath105 in terms of the transfer matrix @xmath106    now we turn to the incident , reflected and transmitted plane waves .",
    "let the incident plane wave be represented in terms of linear polarization components as @xmath107 the corresponding reflected and transmitted plane waves are given as @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "by application of the boundary conditions at @xmath110 and @xmath96 to the solution , the reflection and transmission coefficients are found to be related by the matrix algebraic equation @xmath111 wherein @xmath112 thus , after some manipulation , the reflection and transmission coefficients emerge as @xmath113"
