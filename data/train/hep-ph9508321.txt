    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite ( mssm ) is one of the leading candidate theories for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the mssm is a globally supersymmetric version of the sm , where supersymmetry breaking is implemented by the explicit introduction of soft - supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "the mssm is minimal in the sense that the fewest number of additional new particles and interactions are incorporated which are consistent with phenomenology . in particular , possible baryon ( @xmath3 ) and lepton ( @xmath4 ) number violating interactions are excluded from the superpotential ( the presence of _ both _ @xmath3 and @xmath4 violating interactions can lead to catastrophic proton decay rates ) . as a result , there exists a conserved @xmath5-parity , where the multiplicative quantum number @xmath6 for ordinary particles , and @xmath7 for superpartners .",
    "a consequence of @xmath5-parity conservation is that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable .",
    "theoretical prejudice coupled with experimental constraints strongly favor a color and charge neutral lsp@xcite .",
    "in addition , in the mssm , the lsp is strongly favored to be the massive , weakly interacting lightest neutralino @xmath8@xcite .",
    "@xmath8 s , if they exist , would have been abundantly produced in the early universe ; if so , then relic neutralinos could well make up the bulk of the dark matter in the universe today@xcite .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the framework of the low energy effective lagrangian which is expected to result from , for instance , supergravity grand unified models@xcite . in these models , it is assumed that supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector of the theory .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is then communicated to the observable sector via gravitational interactions , leading to a common mass @xmath9 for all scalar particles , a common mass @xmath10 for all gauginos , a common trilinear coupling @xmath11 , and a bilinear coupling @xmath12 .",
    "these soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are induced at energy scales at or beyond the unification scales , but with ( theoretically motivated ) values typically in the range @xmath13 gev .",
    "the resulting theory , the mssm with universal soft breaking terms , is then regarded as an effective theory with lagrangian parameters renormalized at an ultra - high scale @xmath14 , and valid only below this scale .",
    "the corresponding weak scale sparticle couplings and masses can then be calculated by evolving 26 parameters via renormalization group equations@xcite from the unification scale to the weak scale .",
    "an elegant by - product@xcite of this mechanism is that one of the higgs boson mass squared terms is driven negative , resulting in a breakdown of electroweak symmetry .",
    "the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking constraint allows one to essentially eliminate @xmath3 in favor of @xmath15 ( the ratio of higgs field vev s ) , and to calculate the magnitude of the superpotential higgs mixing term @xmath16 in terms of @xmath17 ( where we actually minimize the full one - loop effective potential ) .",
    "the model is then specified by only four susy parameters ( in addition to sm masses and couplings ) .",
    "a hybrid set consisting of the common gut scale scalar mass @xmath9 , common gaugino mass @xmath10 , common susy - breaking trilinear coupling @xmath11 , along with the weak scale value of @xmath15 proves to be a convenient choice .",
    "in addition , the sign of @xmath16 must be stipulated .",
    "these parameters fix the weak scale masses and couplings of all the sparticles@xcite .",
    "the matter density of the universe @xmath18 is usually parametrized@xcite in terms of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 g/@xmath21 , and @xmath22 , the hubble scaling constant , is related to the hubble constant @xmath23 by @xmath24 km / sec / mpc . here",
    "@xmath22 parametrizes our ignorance of the true value of @xmath23 , so that @xmath25",
    ". measurements of galactic rotation curves suggest @xmath26 , compared to a luminous matter density of @xmath27 .",
    "galactic clustering and galactic flows suggest even larger values of @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the theoretically attractive inflationary cosmological models require a flat universe with @xmath29 .",
    "meanwhile , estimates of the baryonic contribution to the matter density of the universe from big - bang nucleosynthesis suggest that @xmath30 .",
    "these analyses and estimates suggest that the bulk of matter in the universe is ( non - baryonic ) dark matter .",
    "finally , analyses of structure formation in the universe in light of the cobe measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation suggest that dark matter may be made of @xmath31 cold - dark matter ( weakly interacting massive particles or wimps , such as the lightest neutralino @xmath8 ) , @xmath32 hot dark matter ( such as relic neutrinos ) , and @xmath33 baryonic matter .",
    "this is the so - called `` mixed dark matter '' scenario .",
    "the central idea@xcite behind relic density calculations is that in the very early universe , neutralinos were being created and annihilated , but that they were in a state of thermal equilibrium with the cosmic soup . as the universe expanded and cooled , temperatures dropped low enough that neutralinos could no longer be produced ( @xmath34 ) , although they could still annihilate with one another , at a rate governed by the total neutralino pair annihilation cross section , and the neutralino number density",
    "ultimately , as the universe expanded further , the expansion rate outstripped the annihilation rate , thus freezing out the remaining neutralino population of the universe , and locking in a neutralino relic density .",
    "our goal in this paper is to carry out estimates of the neutralino relic density expected from the minimal sugra model .",
    "one solid constraint on supersymmetric models with relic dark matter particles comes from the age of the universe , which ought to be greater than @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) gyrs ; this implies @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , models with too large a relic density would yield too young of a universe , in violation at least with the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , models with @xmath39 would not even be able to account for the dark matter needed to explain galactic rotation : such models would be considered cosmologically uninteresting .",
    "models with intermediate values of @xmath40 are considered cosmologically interesting , as they might explain galactic rotation and clustering , or might even make up the matter density needed for inflationary cosmology , given a cold - dark matter ( cdm : @xmath41 ) or mixed hot / cold dark matter scenario ( mdm : @xmath42 ) .    following the procedures outlined by lee and weinberg@xcite ,",
    "many groups have calculated the relic neutralino abundance@xcite .",
    "early works involved calculating the most important neutralino annihilation channels , usually assuming the lsp was a photino .",
    "later studies included various improvements , including more annihilation channels , more general neutralino mixings , and more realistic supersymmetric particle spectra .",
    "a common thread amongst many papers was the calculation of the boltzmann - averaged quantity @xmath43 using a power series expansion in velocity .",
    "such an approach was shown to be inaccurate when relativistic effects were important , when annihilation proceeded through @xmath44-channel poles , when threshold effects were important , or when co - annihilation processes occured@xcite .",
    "many recent calculations have included some or all of these effects .",
    "we have several goals in mind for the present paper .",
    "* we wish to present reliable calculations for the neutralino relic density in supersymmetric models . to this end",
    "we evaluate _ all _ @xmath45 neutralino annihilation diagram amplitudes numerically as complex numbers , without approximation .",
    "we perform boltzmann averaging using the gondolo - gelmini formalism@xcite .",
    "this takes into account relativistic thermal averaging , while our numerical helicity amplitude technique avoids the usual uncertainties inherent in the velocity expansion , so that breit - wigner poles and threshold effects are fully accounted for .",
    "co - annihilation can occur when the two lightest superpartners are very close in mass this situation rarely occurs within the sugra framework adopted in this paper , and hence we ignore it .",
    "* we present results in the well - motivated sugra framework , which includes gauge coupling unification , higgs mass radiative corrections@xcite , and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking using the one - loop effective potential@xcite . *",
    "our results for the relic density calculation can be directly related to recent calculations for various supersymmetry signals expected at the lep2@xcite , tevatron@xcite and lhc colliders@xcite .",
    "in particular , relic density calculations have a preference for light sleptons .",
    "such light sleptons may well be observable at lep2 or lhc colliders , and yield enhanced rates for @xmath46 states at the tevatron collider@xcite .    to accomodate these goals ,",
    "we present in sec .",
    "ii various details of our relic density calculation , including those peculiar to the present approach . in sec .",
    "iii , we present numerical results for our relic density calculations in the @xmath47 plane of the minimal sugra model . in sec .",
    "iv , these results are explicitly compared to expectations for minimal sugra at various collider experiments , as worked out in a series of previous papers . finally , in sec .",
    "v we present an overview and some conclusions .",
    "we begin our determination of the neutralino relic density from minimal supergravity by selecting a point in the sugra parameter space @xmath48 where in addition we take the top quark mass @xmath49 gev .",
    "the 26 renormalization group equations are iteratively run between the weak scale and the gut scale , which is defined as the point where the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 gauge couplings unify , and is typically @xmath53 gev .",
    "we use 2-loop rge equations for gauge and yukawa couplings ( with susy particle threshold effects ) , but only 1-loop equations for the running of the various soft breaking terms .",
    "the 1-loop effective higgs potential is minimized to enforce radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "our procedure has been described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has been incorporated into the event generator isajet@xcite . at this point ,",
    "a correlated sparticle mass spectrum and couplings emerge from our input point in sugra parameter space .",
    "the next step in our computation , after obtaining the superparticle spectrum , is to evaluate the neutralino relic density by solving the boltzmann equation as formulated for a friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology@xcite .",
    "central to the evaluation of the relic density is the computation of the fully relativistic , thermally averaged neutralino annihilation cross section times velocity , defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) are the momentum and energy of the two colliding particles in the cosmic , co - moving frame of reference , and @xmath59 is the temperature .",
    "the above expression has been reduced to a one - dimensional integral by gondolo and gelmini@xcite , which yields @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the subprocess energy , and @xmath64 are modified bessel functions of order @xmath65 .",
    "we evaluate the neutralino annihilation cross section for @xmath66 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the spin summed and averaged squared matrix element .",
    "our calculation of the relic density is distinct in that we evaluate @xmath69 for _ all _ feynman diagrams listed in table 1 as complex numbers , using the helas@xcite helicity amplitude subroutine package .",
    "thus , our approach avoids the usual uncertainties associated with the expansion of cross section in terms of a power series in velocity .",
    "the integration over @xmath70 is performed numerically using gaussian quadratures .    to evaluate the neutralino relic density ,",

    "we integrate the above expression numerically with gaussian quadratures , taking care to scan finely the regions with a breit - wigner pole . in the region of a pole",
    ", the domain of integration must be broken into very tiny intervals , and obtaining convergence for a single point in parameter space can take up to several hours of cpu time on a dec alpha .",
    "our first numerical results for the relic density from minimal sugra models are given in fig .",
    "1 , where we plot contours of the neutralino relic density @xmath84 in the @xmath47 parameter plane , where we take @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath49 gev .",
    "changes in the @xmath11 parameter mainly affect 3rd generation sparticle masses , and consequently result in only small changes in the relic density .",
    "the regions labelled th are excluded by theoretical considerations : either there is a charged or colored lsp ( or the @xmath88 is lsp ) , or the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking constraint breaks down .",
    "the region labelled by ex corresponds to parameter space already excluded by susy searches at lep or fermilab tevatron experiments@xcite .    in almost all of the plane , we find @xmath89 , _",
    "i.e. _ large enough to explain the galactic rotation curves .",
    "however , the region to the right of the @xmath90 contour is certainly excluded in that the age of the universe would be younger than @xmath35 gyrs . meanwhile , a dominantly cdm inflationary universe would lie in between the @xmath91 contours .",
    "the cobe favored mdm inflationary universe would lie between the @xmath92 contours .",
    "for this latter favored region , @xmath10 is bounded by @xmath93 gev ( corresponding to @xmath94 gev ) , and @xmath95 gev , unless the gluino is very light ( @xmath96 gev ) .",
    "( for comparison , various susy particle mass contours for the same parameter choices are listed in refs .",
    "we find in general that large values of @xmath97 gev ( corresponding to @xmath98 gev ) yield too young a universe ( due to suppression of @xmath99-channel slepton exchange diagrams ) , except for the two narrow corridors in the lower right region of the figure .",
    "the upper of the two corridors corresponds to neutralino annihilation through the @xmath100 pole , so the relic density is largely reduced by @xmath100 mediated @xmath44-channel annihilation diagrams .",
    "the lower of the two corridors corresponds to annihilation through an @xmath44-channel light higgs @xmath22 pole in this case , the relic density falls rapidly to values even below @xmath101 .",
    "a qualitative feel for the relative importance of different annihilation channels can be gleaned from fig .",
    "we plot for @xmath9 fixed at 200 gev , as a function of @xmath10 , the thermally averaged annihilation cross section times velocity , integrated over temperature , which enters into the relic density calculation ( eq .",
    "larger cross sections correspond to smaller relic densities . as @xmath10 increases ,",

    "annihilation into other channels such as @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 amd @xmath113 are included in our calculation , but unimportant given our sugra sparticle mass spectrum , which yields very large masses for higgs bosons other than @xmath22 .",
    "the onset of the @xmath114 can be detected in the @xmath115 curve around @xmath116 gev .",
    "if we plot the relic density for the same parameter choices , but flip the sign of @xmath16 , so that @xmath117 , then we obtain the results of fig .",
    "the relic density contours in this case are similar to those of fig .",
    "1 for large values of @xmath10 , where annihilation dominantly occurs via slepton exchange .",
    "the kink in the contours is due to the onset of the @xmath114 channel . in this case ,",

    "in fact , inflationary models , which require @xmath124 , are only allowed if @xmath125 gev , corresponding to @xmath126 gev . in this plot , there is a significant region extending to large values of @xmath9 , corresponding to large @xmath127 and large @xmath128 , for @xmath129 gev .",

    "the rough overlap of these two pole contributions leads to the single broad corridor of low @xmath84 shown in fig .",
    "recently , various papers have been written on the prospects for supersymmetry at the lep2 @xmath2 collider@xcite , the fermilab tevatron @xmath133 collider@xcite and the cern lhc @xmath0 collider@xcite .",
    "our objective in this section is to assess the prospects for discovery of sugra at hadron and @xmath2 colliders , given the additional constraints from requiring a reasonable value for the neutralino relic density .",
    "we mainly focus on the collider results of refs .",
    "@xcite , since they were performed in a consistent framework , in the same @xmath47 plane .    in fig . 7",

    "the lower - left bulge in the lep2 contour is where sleptons ought to be detectable , while beneath the contour running along @xmath137 gev ( which runs through the neutralino @xmath100-pole annihilation region ) , charginos ought to be detectable . by comparing , we see that the region accessible by lep2 generally has @xmath138 _",
    "i.e. _ not the most cosmologically favored region , but with enough dark matter to explain galactic rotation",
    ". however , the contour labelled with lep2-higgs shows the reach of lep2 for the light susy higgs boson @xmath22 , which is just below @xmath116 gev .",
    "this region completely encloses the favored mdm region .",
    "the implication is that if mdm explains dark matter in the universe , and if @xmath15 is small and @xmath87 , then lep2 ought to discover at least the light susy higgs boson .",
    "the dashed contour labelled tevatron is a composite of the reach of tevatron main injector era ( @xmath139 tev ; @xmath140 fb@xmath136 integrated luminosity ) experiments for multi - jet@xmath141 events@xcite , and mainly , for @xmath46 events@xcite .",
    "we see that the largest reach by tevatron experiments occurs exactly in the cosmologically favored mdm region , and can reach to @xmath142 gev , corresponding to @xmath143 gev .",
    "this is no accident : a reasonable neutralino annihilation cross section generally requires @xmath144 gev ; these lighter sleptons give rise to enhanced leptonic decay of neutralinos , leading to large rates for @xmath46 events .",
    "since lower values of @xmath10 are preferred by fine - tuning arguments@xcite , there is a good chance tevatron experiments could discover susy via @xmath145 events if nature chose this parameter set .",
    "we also compare the results of fig . 7 with expectations for supersymmetry at the cern lhc collider",
    "of course , lhc experiments can cover the whole parameter plane up to @xmath146 gev with only @xmath147 fb@xmath136 of integrated luminosity , at @xmath148 tev , via searches for multi - jet@xmath141 events from gluino and squark cascade decays@xcite , so discovery of susy would be no problem .",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "7 the contour beneath which sleptons ought to be visible at lhc@xcite .",
    "we see that the cosmologically favored mdm region falls almost entirely within the slepton discovery region , so that if the mdm scenario is correct , then lhc has a very high probability to discover a slepton . since sleptons are relatively light , lhc experiments ought as well to be sensitive to @xmath46 events over much , but not all , of the favored mdm region@xcite .",
    "( in some of the favored region , @xmath149 or @xmath150 , thus spoiling the signal . ) finally , since @xmath151 gev in the mdm scenario , sleptons would then likely be visible at a linear @xmath2 collider operating at @xmath1 gev .    in fig .",

    "the lep2 higgs contour in this case lies at @xmath154 gev , and thus covers only a portion of the mdm favored region .",

    ", we note that the mdm favored region lies entirely above the region that is searchable at lep2 . in addition , for this case , the lightest higgs boson has mass @xmath156 gev throughout the plane , beyond the reach of lep2 at @xmath134 gev . hence ,",
    "if @xmath15 is large , and the mdm scenario is correct , then there would be little hope of seeing susy at lep2 . in this case , the prospect for minimal sugra at tevatron mi is even worse , except for the narrow region extending along @xmath157 gev , which enters into the cosmologically favored mdm region .",

    "<S> working within the framework of the minimal supergravity model with gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , we evaluate the cosmological relic density from lightest neutralinos produced in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical calculation is distinct in that it involves direct evaluation of neutralino annihilation cross sections using helicity amplitude techniques , and thus avoids the usual expansion as a power series in terms of neutralino velocity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our calculation includes relativistic boltzmann averaging , neutralino annihilation threshold effects , and proper treatment of integration over breit - wigner poles . </S>",
    "<S> we map out regions of parameter space that give rise to interesting cosmological dark matter relic densities . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these regions with recent calculations of the reach for supersymmetry by lep2 and tevatron main injector era experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmologically favored regions overlap considerably with the regions where large trilepton signals are expected to occur at the tevatron . the cern lhc @xmath0 collider can make a thorough exploration of the cosmologically favored region via gluino and squark searches . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , over most of the favored region , sleptons ought to be light enough to be detectable at both lhc and at a @xmath1 gev @xmath2 collider . </S>"
