    "it is well - known that the long - time behaviour of solutions of partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics can , in many cases , be described in terms of global attractors of the associated semigroups ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for a large class of equations of mathematical physics , including parabolic partial differential equations modelling reaction , diffusion and drift , hyperbolic type equations , and so on ,",
    "the corresponding attractor has finite hausdorff and fractal dimensions .",
    "thus , the dynamics on the attractor happens to be finite - dimensional , even though the system is governed by a set of partial differential equations .",
    "as the dimension of the attractor is indicative of the number of degrees of freedom needed to simulate a given dynamical system , it is then crucial to obtain more realistic estimates for its dimension in terms of observable physical quantities .    aside from some applied motivation ,",
    "much of the mathematical interest nowadays is centered on the dynamics of boundary value problems with _",
    "static _ boundary conditions of dirichlet and neumann - robin type , or even periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the influence of these dissipative boundary conditions on a given model has only been recently investigated in connection with a class of reaction - diffusion systems . in @xcite",
    ", a first contribution is made to the understanding of this problem with a robin boundary condition .",
    "in particular , it is shown , for a fixed nonlinearity , how the flow defined by the reaction - diffusion system depends on the interaction between diffusion @xmath4  and another parameter @xmath5involved in the boundary condition ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "a classification of points in @xmath6-space , as structurally stable , or bifurcation points , for a one - dimensional scalar reaction - diffusion equation with a cubic nonlinearity is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "other studies on the influence of boundary conditions upon the solution structures of partial differential equations have also been done by other scientists .",
    "these studies have analyzed the detailed effect of boundary conditions on the structure of global attractors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the equilibrium is nonhyperbolic and a bifurcation occurs , the structure of attractors may vary with respect to boundary conditions .",
    "this has been observed in the analysis of pattern formation in a 1d reaction - diffusion system @xcite , in lattice systems @xcite , in the study of steady state bifurcations @xcite , and finally in @xcite , on mode - jumping of the von karman equations .",
    "although the global attractors of these systems will depend , for a given nonlinearity , on the choice of the boundary conditions , their finite dimension does generally _",
    "not_. this result can be easily formulated for a scalar reaction - diffusion equation , as follows .",
    "consider the parabolic partial differential equation@xmath7where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is a bounded domain with sufficiently smooth boundary @xmath11 @xmath12 , and @xmath4 , @xmath13 are positive constants .",

    "this semigroup possesses the global attractor @xmath23 , which may depend on the choice of the boundary conditions , and @xmath23 has finite fractal dimension for each @xmath24 .",

    ", we observe that these estimates are sharp with respect to @xmath32 ( for each fixed @xmath33 ) , or sufficiently large @xmath13 ( for each fixed @xmath34 ) .",
    "hence , these bounds for the dimension of @xmath23  are of the same order for each @xmath25 .",
    "these remarkable estimates  also depend linearly on the `` volume '' of the spatial domain @xmath35 , which is consistent with physical intuition .",
    "this property of the dimension of the attractor has not been proved for all equations , such as , the kuramoto - sivashinski equation .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to investigate the dependance of the dimension of the global attractor for equation ( [ she ] ) subject to a completely new class of boundary conditions , which are sometimes dubbed as _ wentzell _ boundary conditions , and which have some applications in probability theory , specifically , markov processes .",
    "but what are they really ? to put them into a context , let @xmath36 be an elliptic differential operator of the second order ( e.g. , @xmath37 ) with coefficients that are well - defined over @xmath38 .",
    "it is known that there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath39-semigroups and markov processes in @xmath38 which are homogeneous in time and satisfy the condition of feller @xcite ( that is , the range of the resolvent operator coincides with a prescribed set ) .",
    "thus , to each such markov process there is a corresponding semigroup of operators@xmath40where the markov transition function @xmath41 satisfies @xmath42 for @xmath43 @xmath44 and any borel set @xmath45 . as a function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 is a probability measure .",
    "what are the most general boundary conditions which restrict the given operator @xmath36  ( more correctly , its closure ) to the infinitesimal operator of a semigroup of positive contraction operators acting on @xmath48 ?",
    "wentzell @xcite gave a partial answer to this question in higher space dimensions by finding a sufficiently large class of boundary conditions which involve differential operators on the boundary that are of the same order as the operator acting in @xmath30 .",
    "he discovered the following form of boundary conditions:@xmath49where @xmath50 denotes the outward normal at @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a positive constant and @xmath53 is the outward co - normal derivative of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "we refer also to the pioneering work of @xcite , for generation theorems for @xmath36 with wentzell boundary conditions in one space dimension . until the work of @xcite , the study of the operator @xmath36  with wentzell boundary conditions was usually confined to generation properties of this operator in the space @xmath54 . in 2002",
    ", the authors in @xcite have found a way to introduce the wentzell boundary condition ( [ wbc ] ) in an @xmath55-context , which led to the discovery of the natural space for these type of problems ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for an extensive survey of these results and some history .    for the homogeneous linear heat equation ( [ she ] ) ( that is , @xmath56 ) , the wentzell boundary condition ( [ wbc ] )  is equivalent to a purely differential equation of the form@xmath57thus ,",
    "the main attraction here is that there is a dynamic element introduced into the boundary condition .",
    "the heat equation , supplemented by either ( wbc ) or ( [ dyn ] ) , corresponds to the situation where there is a heat source ( if @xmath58 ) or sink ( if @xmath59 ) acting on the boundary @xmath51 . mathematically speaking , this kind of conditions ( [ dyn ] ) arises due to the presence of additional boundary terms in the free energy , which must also account for the action of a source on @xmath51  ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) , for an extensive derivation and physical interpretation of ( [ dyn ] ) for ( [ she ] ) . for the nonlinear parabolic equation ( [ she ] ) , the boundary condition ( wbc )",
    "can be formally be transformed into a condition of the form@xmath60generally , one may replace @xmath61 in ( [ dyn2 ] ) by another arbitrary function @xmath62 , satisfying suitable assumptions . with more sophisticated arguments , using techniques from semigroup theory , and a variation of parameter formula , it is possible to prove that the regularity of the solution for ( [ she]),([dyn2 ] ) increases as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath63 become more regular ( see section 2 ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath64 , if @xmath30 is a bounded @xmath65 domain and @xmath29 is a @xmath66 function , regularity theory implies that the solution @xmath67 to ( [ she]),([dyn2 ] ) belongs @xmath68 for all @xmath69 and all positive times . at least in this case",
    ", the boundary condition ( [ wbc ] ) , for equation ( [ she ] ) , is equivalent to the boundary condition ( [ dyn2 ] ) .",
    "however , in general , this may not be so if the solution , for the semilinear problem ( [ she ] ) and the wentzell condition ( [ dyn2 ] ) , is not smooth enough .",
    "since we wish to treat the most general case , by imposing the least regularity assumptions on @xmath70 @xmath63 and @xmath71 we will devote our attention only to the study of ( [ she ] ) , subject to linear boundary conditions of the form ( [ dyn ] ) .",
    "our results below can be immediately extended to other classes of nonlinear wentzell boundary conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "boundary conditions of the form ( [ dyn2 ] ) arise for many known equations of mathematical physics .",
    "they are motivated by heat control problems formulated in the book of duvaut and lions @xcite , problems in phase - transition phenomena @xcite ( and their references ) , special flows in hydrodynamics @xcite , stefan problems @xcite , models in climatology @xcite , and many others .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a more complete list of references involving the application of such boundary conditions to real - world phenomena .    by keeping our treatment of the boundary condition simple ,",
    "we wish to prove that the problem ( [ she ] ) , ( [ dyn ] ) generates a dynamical system on a suitable phase - space , possessing a finite dimensional global attractor @xmath72 then , we establish that the haussdorf and fractal dimensions of @xmath0 satisfy the following  upper and lower bounds:@xmath73for @xmath74 and@xmath75 in one space dimension .",

    "we remark that the bounds we obtain in ( [ lb2])-([lb3 ] ) are quite simple and their explicit dependance on the physical parameters is transparent .",

    "it is worth pointing out that the bounds in ( [ lb4 ] ) are proportional to the `` surface area '' @xmath84 of @xmath11 and _ not _ the `` volume '' @xmath85  of @xmath86 this is remarkable ; most nonlinear equations arising in mathematical physics , involving the laplacian on bounded domains , have the dimension of the attractor of the order of @xmath87 for some @xmath88 and for sufficiently large domains .",
    "this property may have profound implications in the prediction of weather and climate .",
    "the reader is referred to section 4 where this interesting physical observation is further discussed for the balance equations governing the large - scale oceanic motion .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ ub ]",

    "unlike the previous results , the dimension of the attractor is proportional to the surface area @xmath350 for large domains @xmath30 and fixed parameters @xmath181 @xmath13 and @xmath52 .",
