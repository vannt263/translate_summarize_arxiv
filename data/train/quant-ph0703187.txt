    "the topic whether orbital angular momentum ( oam ) is conserved in spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has been studied for many years @xcite .",
    "conservation of oam in the spdc process has been theoretically attributed to phase matching @xcite , transfer of plane - wave spectrum from pump beam to down - converted beams @xcite , or to collinear geometry @xcite . however , according to quantum mechanics , the conservation of angular momentum ( am ) arises from the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian describing the studied physical process .",
    "recently , experimental evidence @xcite has been found which shows that am non - conservation can occur in spdc process due to spatial asymmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "it can be theoretically shown @xcite , under the paraxial approximation , that oam is conserved in the spdc process for thin non - linear media if one assumes that the two - photon detection amplitude ( the definition follows soon ) in the spdc process reproduces the pump beam transverse profile .",
    "this assumption could be invalid in type - ii spdc process where oam non - conservation was observed @xcite , which stimulated our study presented here .",
    "the two - photon detection amplitude in the spdc process has been extensively explored both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite without considering the physical variable of oam .",
    "more works have been published on the same topic when non - zero oam is concerned @xcite .",
    "further inspection shows that all these works implicitly assume rotationally symmetric hamiltonian for the spdc process , which is intrinsically related to am conservation .",
    "we investigate the cases where both oam conservation and oam non - conservation are taken into account .",
    "we follow arnaut and barbosa @xcite in our theoretical treatment .",
    "as one will see , there is an essential difference between the notations in @xcite and those used in @xcite .",
    "in most theoretical works involving the variable of oam @xcite , coordinates were chosen such that the @xmath0-axis is along the direction of the oam carried by the light beam under study for convenience .",
    "we consider the general case where the coordinates are arbitrarily chosen ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    the vector of oam * j * in arbitrarily chosen coordinates .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the polar angle and the azimuthal angle , respectively . ]",
    "when the conservation of a vector is concerned , one should always break the vector into components , for example , along @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0-axes .",
    "the conservation of the vector means all these components are conserved .",
    "if one of the components is not conserved , the vector is said to be non - conserved .",
    "the same argument applies to the cases of oam ( non-)conservation in the spdc process .    to exam",
    "whether the oam is conserved along the pump propagation direction ( @xmath0-direction ) in the spdc process , one needs to theoretically describe the state of the down - converted light beams that carry oams , the @xmath0-components of which are , say @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "an elegant approach exploiting orbital poincar spheres to study this general case was provided in @xcite , where the @xmath0-component of oam carried by photons is , however , not guaranteed to be integer times @xmath7 .",
    "we quantize the studied field along @xmath0-axis . in quantum theory",
    ", the eigenstate of the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath8 can be found by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath9 which leads to a solution for a one - photon field in free space as follows @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath0-component of the oam carried by the photon ( @xmath12 is any integer ) , and @xmath13 the azimuthal angle of the wave vector @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 is a function _ independent _ of the azimuthal angle @xmath13 and , therefore , can be written in the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the amplitude of the transverse component @xmath18 of @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath19 is the photon creation operator .",
    "one notes that the freedom of the field polarization is neglected and emphasizes that the @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) has a physical meaning ( oam along the @xmath0-axis ) that is essentially _ different _ from what means by the same notation in @xcite , where the @xmath20 represents the oam carried by photons along the axes dictated by the _ signal _ , _ idler _ , or pump central vectors .",
    "the one - photon detection amplitude @xmath21 , where @xmath22 [ @xmath23(*k * ) is the annihilation operator , @xmath24 is a coefficient that depends on the amplitude of @xmath25 , for the one - photon field in the eigenstate of the operator @xmath8 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 . in a plane ( @xmath28 ) transverse to the @xmath0-axis , the one - photon detection amplitude will be @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "now we show that @xmath32 is azimuthally symmetric , i.e. , it is invariant under the operation of rotation around the @xmath0-axis ( azimuthal rotation ) defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    under the operation @xmath36 , the function @xmath37 is transformed into a new one : @xmath38 . given that @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "with the integral variable @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 [ please note that @xmath45 is independent of the azimuthal angle , i.e. , @xmath46 , which means invariant modulus for @xmath37 under the rotational operation : @xmath47 .",

    "here we consider the general case , in which the oam conservation may be violated in the spdc process .    assuming a classical pump beam , two down - converted modes , _ signal _ and _ idler _ , which are initially empty , and linear polarization for all involved light beams , the hamiltonian describing the non - linear process of spdc in the interaction picture is @xcite    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the non - linear interaction volume , @xmath57 , @xmath58 are unit vectors representing the linear polarizations of the down - converted modes , and @xmath59 is the electrical field associated with the pump beam .",

    "it is well known that , in the type - i case , the down - conversion is a single - ring pattern , which has azimuthally spatial symmetry [ fig . [ fig2](a ) ] .",
