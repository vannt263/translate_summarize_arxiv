    "in the next few years it is expected that a large amount of novel informations on neutron stars ( ns s ) will be available from the new generation of x  ray and @xmath6ray satellites .",
    "therefore , a great interest is devoted presently to the study of ns s and to the prediction of their structure on the basis of the properties of dense matter .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of ns matter covers a wide density range , from @xmath7 g/@xmath8 in the surface to several times nuclear matter saturation density ( @xmath9 g/@xmath8 ) in the center of the star ( shapiro et al .",

    "the possible appearance of such an exotic core has enormous consequences for the neutron star and black hole formation mechanism ( bombaci 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately large uncertainities are still present in the theoretical treatment of this ultra  dense regime ( glendenning 1985 , prakash et al .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we consider a more conventional picture assuming the ns core is composed only by an uncharged mixture of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction ( @xmath11stable matter ) . even in this picture",
    ", the determination of the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter to describe the core of the ns , remains a formidable theoretical problem ( hjorth - jensen et al .",

    "any `` realistic '' eos must satisfy several requirements : i ) it must display the correct saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) ; ii ) it must give a symmetry energy compatible with nuclear phenomenology and well behaved at high densities ; iii ) for snm the incompressibility at saturation must be compatible with the values extracted from phenomenology ( myers et al .",
    "1996 ) ; iv ) both for neutron matter ( nem ) and snm the speed of sound must not exceed the speed of light ( causality condition ) , at least up to the relevant densities ; the latter condition is automatically satisfied only in fully relativistic theory .    in this work we present results for some ns properties obtained on the basis of a microscopic eos which satisfies requirements i",

    "the two methods give results in reasonable agreement in the case of snm up to a density @xmath32 , whereas sizeable differences are evident for nem already at densities @xmath33 .",
    "a similar outcome has been found by comparing variational and @xmath24 saturation curves for the same nn potential ( day , et al 1985 ) .",

    "in fig.2 we report the energy per nucleon as a function of the number density @xmath15 calculated in the bhf approximation using the paris ( solid curves ) and the av14 potentials ( dashed curves ) up to densities typically encountered in the core of a neutron star .",
    "the upper curves refer to neutron matter and the lower ones to symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we notice that the eos derived with the paris potential is stiffer than the one obtained with the av14 interaction .",
    "this is possibly due to the momentum dependence of the paris potential , as discussed recently in ref.(engvik et al .",

    "[ h ]      non  relativistic calculations , based on purely two  body interactions , fail to reproduce the correct saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter ( coester et al .",
    "this well known deficiency is commonly corrected introducing three - body forces ( tbf ) .",
    "unfortunately , it seems not possible to reproduce the experimental binding energies of light nuclei and the correct saturation point accurately with one simple set of tbf ( wiringa et al .",
    "relevant progress has been made in the theory of nucleon tbf , but a complete theory is not yet available .",
    "a realistic model for nuclear tbf has been introduced by the urbana group ( carlson et al . 1983 ; schiavilla et al .",
    "the urbana model consists of an attractive term @xmath34 due to two  pion exchange with excitation of an intermediate @xmath35-resonance , and a repulsive phenomenological central term @xmath36    @xmath37    the two  pion exchange contribution is a cyclic sum over the nucleon indices _ i , j , k _ of products of anticommutator \\ { , } and commutator [ , ] terms    @xmath38 [ \\tau_i \\cdot \\tau_j,\\tau_j \\cdot \\tau_k ] \\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath39    is the one  pion exchange operator , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the pauli spin and isospin operators , and @xmath42 $ ] is the tensor operator .",

    "1983 ) .",
    "we introduced the same urbana three - nucleon model within the bhf approach . to incorporate the tbf in the brueckner scheme we followed the method of lejeune et al .",
    "the tbf is reduced to an effective two - body force by averaging on the position of the third particle , assuming that the probability of having two particles at a given distance is reduced according to the two - body correlation function .",
    "the resulting effective two - body force is of course density dependent .",
    "further details will be given elsewhere ( baldo et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have adjusted the parameters a and u in order to reproduce closely the correct saturation point of snm , since for ns studies this is an essential requirement , and there is no reason to believe that tbf be the same as in light nuclei .",
    "our values for the tbf parameters are @xmath50 and @xmath51 both for the paris and the av14 potentials .",
    "the corresponding eos s obtained using the paris ( solid line ) and the av14 potentials ( short dashed line ) are depicted in fig . 3 for symmetric ( panel ( a ) ) and neutron matter ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the corresponding values are reported in table 1 .",
    "those eos s saturate respectively at    @xmath52    and    @xmath53    they are characterized by an incompressibility @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the latter being very close to the recent phenomenological estimate of myers ( 1996 ) .",

    "in conclusion , we computed some properties of ns s on the basis of a microscopic eos obtained in the framework of bbg many  body theory with two and three  body nuclear interactions .",
    "our brueckner - hartree - fock eos with three - body forces satisfies the general physical requirements ( points i  iv ) discussed in the introduction .",
    "this is the main feature which distinguishes our eos s with respect to other microscopic non  relativistic eos ( wiringa et al .",
    "1988 , engvik et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "two different two - body potentials have been used , the argonne av14 and the paris interactions .",
    "the latter turns out to produce a slightly stiffer eos already at two - body level .",
    "the same three - body force , within the urbana model , has been added to both two - body interactions , and this produces similar saturation points close to the empirical one .",
    "the bhf calculations with three - body forces show again that the paris potential gives an eos stiffer than the one from the argonne av14 and a larger symmetry energy as a function of density . as a consequence",
    "the proton fraction is larger for the paris and the urca process onset appears at lower density .",
    "the calculated maximum mass is in agreement with observed ns masses ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "however the limiting mass , radius and central density are relatively close to each other for the two interactions . in particular",
    "the critical masses differ by no more than @xmath56 , while the radius and central density are essentially equal . on the contrary all these three critical physical parameters are appreciably different from the ones derived from the dirac - brueckner approach ( li et al . 1992 ) as well as from the variational results .",
    "the latter displays also a rather different trend of the symmetry energy .    for the argonne av14 ( paris )",
    "potential the bhf approach with three - body forces predicts a lower limit for the mass above which neutron stars can support the direct urca process , @xmath4 ( @xmath57 ) . the stars with mass larger than this value",
