    "the production and measurement of sub - picosecond bunches is an important topic for modern accelerators . to measure",
    "reliably the length of such short bunches with destroying them several approaches are possible :    * electro - optic ( eo ) sampling  @xcite uses a non linear crystal in which the bunch wakefield will induce optical changes .",
    "it requires a femtosecond laser .",
    "its limitations due to material properties are discussed in  @xcite . * coherent transition radiation ( ctr )  @xcite uses the radiation emitted when the beam crosses a thin foil . in some cases",
    "it may be difficult to discriminate the signal from ctr for other sources of radiation ( e.g. : synchrotron radiation ) generated further upstream . *",
    "coherent smith - purcell radiation  @xcite ( cspr ) , uses a grating to induce the emission of radiation .",
    "it has the advantage of dispersing the radiation at the point of emission and therefore being more immune to background noise .",
    "it is described below .    to correctly interpret the cspr signal and use it to reconstruct the bunch profile it is important to have a sound understanding of the theoretical model .",
    "the focus of this paper is to compare several spr single electron yield ( sey ) models to show that the model uncertainty does not significantly affect experimental measurement and profile reconstruction and to compare the signal behavior close from the grating ( near - field zone ) .",
    "smith - purcell radiation is produced by a charged particle passing near a surface of a conducting periodical grating . in multiple papers  @xcite authors considered a profile of the grating as a set of the periodically repeating `` @xmath0 '' pairs of `` rising '' an `` falling '' facets as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : geom1 ] , with the period of repetition `` @xmath1 '' , a blaze angle `` @xmath2 '' ( @xmath3 in  @xcite ) , the width `` @xmath4 '' and the length `` @xmath5 '' .",
    "the choice of such profile is explained in  @xcite , by a possibility to do derive simpler analytical expressions and thus define the relation between the grating parameters and the spr characteristics .",
    "it is convenient to chose the same profile for a comparison purposes .",
    "the leading models to calculate the spr single electron yield ( sey ) are :    * the surface current model  @xcite , that explains spr through the currents that are being induced on the surface of the grating by a charge passing nearby .",
    "this theory has proven to be in a good agreement with experiments for energies from a few  mev to 28.5  gev  @xcite .",

    "@xmath13 is a grating efficiency parameter , that depends on the radiation angle and blaze angle .",

    "the gfw model gives intensity 10 times bigger , than the rdr and sc models , which could be explained by the fact , that in gfw calculations authors take into account the width of the grating , and the grating efficiency parameter is calculated numerically , for the case of n grating facets .",
    "the sey of the several leading models of the spr were compared .",
    "the simulation shows that the sc and rdr models are in agreement within experimental errors .",
    "the rrr model is also close to the rdr and sc , but in our calculation one constant had to be adjusted .",
