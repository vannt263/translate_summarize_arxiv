    "the dynamics of reheating after inflation have been studied intensively  @xcite ever since the first models of inflation were formulated . in many cases ,",
    "this process takes place non - perturbatively via a parametric resonance between the inflaton and matter fields  @xcite . in this scenario , which is known as preheating ,",
    "the long - wavelength matter modes are exponentially amplified to a very high effective temperature .",
    "this may have the consequence that certain symmetries , which are spontaneously broken at the reheat temperature , are temporarily restored during this non - thermal stage  @xcite .",
    "when the fields thermalize , the symmetry breaks again , leading possibly to formation of topological defects  @xcite . in models of electroweak scale inflation",
    ", the period of non - thermal symmetry restoration may also explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued more recently by felder _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that in hybrid inflationary models , this parametric resonance often fails to take place . in these models",
    ", inflation ends because a scalar field becomes unstable and its long - wavelength modes grow while the inflaton field rolls down the potential .",
    "the dynamics of this `` tachyonic '' or spinodal instability have been studied by many authors  @xcite , using a range of different methods .",
    "naively , the inflaton field would be expected to start oscillating once it reaches the minimum of the potential .",
    "what felder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed was that the oscillations die away almost immediately , and coined the term `` tachyonic preheating '' to describe this phenomenon .",
    "this damping rules out the possibility of ordinary preheating , but the tachyonic instability itself still can lead to many similar effects , such as generation of baryon asymmetry  @xcite , defect formation  @xcite and particle production  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the physical origin of the damping has remained unclear until now .    in this paper",
    ", we use both detailed analytical calculations and non - perturbative numerical simulations to study the dynamics of tachyonic preheating after hybrid inflation .",
    "analytical results show that the upper limit , @xmath0 , of the range of momenta amplified during the instability has a simple dependence on the velocity @xmath1 of the inflaton field at the instability point , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this is essentially equivalent to calculations of the number of topological defects formed in a phase transition  @xcite .",
    "we confirm this result in our numerical simulations , in which we include also the inflaton as a dynamical field , by measuring the power spectrum directly and also by measuring the number of topological defects formed in the transition .",
    "furthermore , we study the later evolution of the system , and show that because the potential in hybrid models is extremely flat above the critical value , the oscillations of the inflaton field form roughly spherical `` hot spots '' , inside which the energy density is very high and symmetry restoration can take place locally . depending on the values of the couplings",
    ", these hot spots may appear already during the first oscillation of the inflaton field .",
    "we believe this explains the strong dissipation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the inflaton field was observed to settle down in its minimum after only few oscillations .",
    "we carry out most of our simulations in two dimensions , because that allows us to treat a wider range of length scales in a single simulation , but in order to check that our results are not specific of two dimensions , we repeat some of the simulations in three dimensions .",
    "the breaking of global symmetries leads to the existence of massless goldstone bosons , which are instead not present in the case of the breaking of local gauge symmetries .",
    "we recall that there is no experimental evidence for the existence of such scalars whose couplings to the particles of the standard model of particle physics are severely constrained by the present data .",
    "therefore we study also the case in which the broken symmetry is a local gauge invariance .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : we start by reviewing the basic features of hybrid inflationary models in section  [ sect : hybrid ] . in section  [",
    "sect : instability ] , we study the instability of the scalar field analytically both in the approximation that the mass term changes instantaneously and in the more realistic case of hybrid inflation .",
    "we present the details of our two - dimensional lattice simulations , together with the results for the power spectrum in section  [ sec : simu ] , and the results for the defect density in section  [ sect : defects ] . in section  [",
    "sect : locres ] , we show that the oscillations of the inflaton field lead to `` hot spots '' with local symmetry restoration . in section  [ sect:3dsimu ] ,",
    "we present results of three - dimensional simulations showing that our findings apply to that case as well .",
    "in models of hybrid inflation  @xcite , the inflaton field @xmath3 is coupled to another scalar field @xmath4 , which becomes unstable at a certain critical value of @xmath5 .",
    "this causes the slow roll conditions to break down , and inflation ends .",
    "the simplest realization of this idea has the potential @xmath6 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real scalars . during inflation",
    ", the inflaton has a large value , @xmath7 , where we have defined @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the effective mass term of the @xmath4 field , @xmath9 , is positive and the symmetry @xmath10 is restored .",
    "eventually , @xmath3 reaches @xmath11 , and @xmath12 becomes negative , implying that the @xmath4 field becomes unstable , or tachyonic .",

    "@xcite . ) when the symmetry breaks , all directions on the vacuum manifold are equally probable , and whichever the system happens to choose is purely a matter of chance .",
    "however the correlation length of the @xmath4 field can not be infinite at the time of the transition , and therefore the system can not choose the same direction everywhere in space but only inside domains whose size is determined by the correlation length @xmath144 at the time of the transition .",
    "this argument was made more accurate by zurek  @xcite , who related @xmath144 to the rate of the transition and the critical indices of the theory .",
    "the present case in which the defects are formed at the end of inflation is particularly simple , because , as the inflation has diluted away all the energy density , we can assume that the universe is at zero temperature .",

    "each data point is an average of eight different runs with different random initial conditions , but we used the same set of eight initial conditions for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "testing the prediction in eq .",
    "( [ equ : predlwall ] ) is not entirely straightforward , because , as the domain wall network evolves with time , the measured value of @xmath155 depends on when the measurement was carried out .",
    "this choice is more or less arbitrary , and we have used two different ways of determining the time of the measurement : either when @xmath157 crosses a certain threshold value , or when @xmath158 crosses zero .",
    "these choices can be interpreted as different ways of giving the quantity @xmath155 a precise definition .    when @xmath157 is small , domain walls are ill - defined objects , because the sign of @xmath4 can vary simply due to random fluctuations . therefore the measurements at @xmath159 give high values and do not agree with the predicted power law .",
    "later , when @xmath160 or @xmath161 , the correspondence between the measurements and the prediction ( [ equ : predlwall ] ) is good at high values of @xmath1 , apart from a constant factor of around five . because the prediction was intended to give the order of magnitude only , we can conclude that the agreement is good .",
    "however , we can see that at very low values of @xmath1 , the predicted power law breaks down .",

    "of course , we can not rule out the possibility that the prediction ( [ equ : predlwall ] ) breaks down at low @xmath1 in the full quantum theory , either .",

    "we can see that at high @xmath1 , the power - law prediction breaks down in this case .",
    "this all illustrates that measuring @xmath155 accurately is rather difficult , because the result depends on the time when the measurement is carried out .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that the prediction ( [ equ : predlwall ] ) works reasonably well in a wide range of velocities @xmath1 .",
    "in ordinary thermal phase transitions , the defect network formed in the transition evolves mostly dissipatively , and the domain wall loops would simply collapse and disappear with time .",
    "however , in the case of hybrid inflation , the dynamics of the inflaton field may have significant effects on the later evolution of the system .",
    "( [ equ : sigma - hybrid-01 ] ) shows that if the @xmath4 field were completely homogeneous , the inflaton would oscillate with roughly the frequency @xmath165 .",
    "however , the presence of a defect network means that @xmath4 is far from being homogeneous : it vanishes in the cores of the defects , and furthermore , when the defects annihilate , they release energy , which heats up the system locally and leads to inhomogeneities in @xmath4 . in this case , the frequency of @xmath3 becomes dependent on the position in space .    in regions where the effective @xmath166 is lower than the average value ,",

    ", this means that the amplitude of the oscillations of the @xmath3 field can eventually exceed @xmath11 at certain localized points . above that value ,",
    "the potential becomes flat , and @xmath191 can shoot to very high values .    a somewhat similar phenomenon has been discussed by mcdonald  @xcite , who showed using a linear analysis that the self - interaction of the inflaton field may lead to the formation of `` condensate lumps '' . in our case ,",
    "the interaction with the matter field @xmath4 plays a more important role , because the inflaton - matter coupling is stronger than the inflaton self - coupling and because the instability at the end of inflation generates large inhomogeneities in the @xmath4 field .",
    "if the damping of the oscillations caused by the expansion of the universe or by interactions with other fields is very weak , this overshoot may happen already when @xmath3 reaches its turning point for the first time .",
    "a very rough way of estimating how likely this is consists in calculating the damping of the amplitude during the first oscillation , @xmath192 thus , if @xmath193 , this localized overshoot is likely to happen at the first turning point .    even if there is no overshoot at that time , the amplitude of oscillations grows gradually at points where the frequency is lower , and @xmath191 may therefore exceed @xmath11 at some later time .",
    "we can see this effect in our two - dimensional simulations , even when we take into account the expansion of the universe with the hubble rate @xmath194 , which corresponds to @xmath195 .",

    "eventually , @xmath191 exceeds @xmath11 in these regions , and the @xmath152 symmetry is locally restored . because the potential of @xmath3 is extremely flat above @xmath11 , the force that pulls @xmath3 back towards its minimum , effectively disappears at this point .    a snapshot of the energy density at this stage is shown in fig .  [ fig : bubbles ] . the bright , almost circular disks are regions in which the energy density is very high . in this particular case ,",
    "all these `` hot spots '' are located at a domain wall , but this is not always the case . in some simulations , they appeared in places where shock waves form cusps or loop collapses hit each other .",
    "we stress that for the existence of these hot spots , it is crucial that in hybrid inflationary models , the inflaton potential is extremely flat above the critical value . in a model with a convex potential , they would only appear as regions with a slightly higher amplitude .",
    "even with the flat potential , the gradient energy pulls @xmath3 towards the origin , and therefore it is slowly oscillating around zero with a high amplitude .",
    "of course , there is nothing that would stabilize these hot spots , and therefore they eventually die away having radiated away their energy .",
