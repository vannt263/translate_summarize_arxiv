    "laser cooling is today an established technique to produce samples of atoms with temperature approaching the zero kelvin limit .",
    "ultra - cold strontium samples are largely studied , with experiments ranging from quantum degeneracy , quantum computation , to applications as quantum sensors of force and highly accurate optical clocks .",
    "these experiments are all based on an oven , which provides the needed flux of atoms in an ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) environment ( pressure @xmath4 mbar ) . at room temperature",
    "the vapor pressure of alkaline earth metals ( as strontium ) is lower than that of alkali at the same temperature , for this reason relatively high temperature ovens are typically needed ( @xmath5c for @xmath6 ) . in particular the application of alkaline earth metals for optical clocks is today prompting significant scientific and technological efforts for the realization of compact , reliable and transportable apparatus , in the perspective of a their future use in space @xcite .",
    "this background is at the basis of our study on an efficient strontium oven , which represents one of the critical parts in an optical clock in terms of power consumption , size and heat management .",
    "here we describe a compact and efficient strontium oven essentially based on a heater placed in vacuum .",
    "the novelty of the proposed oven concerns the synthesis of the solutions proposed so far for high efficient atomic beam sources ( for a general review of atomic sources see @xcite ) , such as capillaries and thermal shield , into a compact design , for both horizontal and vertical operation , without the complication of independent heaters for capillaries and crucible and without water cooling of the thermal shield .",
    "additionally reduced size and high efficiency ( high flux at lower temperature and power consumption ) imply a simplified heat management of the test chamber where clock spectroscopy is performed , with important consequences on the uncertainty budget of clock measurement , nowadays limited by the lack of control of the homogeneity of the blackbody environment @xcite .",
    "the use of this oven can be extended to other alkali and alkaline earth metals not reacting with stainless - steel at high temperature .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) section view of the compact strontium oven showing the internal components and layout .",
    "( b ) picture of the oven with the aluminum thermal shield . for the sake of comparison a one euro coin is displayed . ]",
    "the oven design is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oven_design ] . about 6@xmath7 g of metallic strontium are placed in a stainless - steel reservoir , with internal length and diameter respectively of 34@xmath7 mm and 10@xmath7 mm . the reservoir is electrically heated in vacuum by a 0.3 mm diameter tantalum wire threaded through an alumina ( al23 ) multi - bore tube .",
    "this material has been chosen since it ensures both a high electrical insulation ( specific resistance @xmath8 at @xmath9 ) and a good thermal conductivity ( @xmath10 at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the reservoir is closed by a dn16cf flange ( removable for strontium refilling ) sealed by a standard nickel gasket .",
    "the opposite side of the reservoir is terminated by a nozzle ( diameter @xmath11 mm , length @xmath12 mm ) filled with @xmath13 stainless - steel capillaries @xmath14 mm long and with an internal radius @xmath15 . the high temperature assembly",
    " reservoir + closing flange \" is supported by three stainless - steel rods ( diameter @xmath16 mm ) welded on a dn40cf flange .",
    "the thermal contact between the high temperature assembly and the supporting rods is reduced by using steatite split bushes uhv cleaned , having a thermal conductivity of @xmath17 at @xmath9 , about one order of magnitude below that of 304 stainless - steel at the same temperature .",
    "the oven can be hosted in a standard dn40cf cube , which can be connected to an ion pump and to a generic vacuum system for laser - cooling experiments .",
    "the vacuum environment prevents the convection mechanism of heat transfer .",
    "the remaining heat transfer channel is represented by the thermal radiation ( blackbody radiation ) of the hot reservoir at @xmath1 . in order to shield this radiation the oven",
    "is surrounded by a @xmath18 mm thick aluminum cylinder .",
    "aluminum has been chosen for its low emissivity coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "electrical power is applied by means of two uhv electrical feedthroughs . here",
    "two stainless - steel clamps are used to electrically connect the two feedthrough pins to the tantalum heating wire .",
    "short circuits are prevented by beading the two tantalum wire terminations with alumina tubes ( 0.4 mm internal diameter ) .",
    "tantalum wires go through the dn16cf flange and reservoir and finally into the multi - bore tube heater by means of an alumina tube 28 mm long and with two @xmath20 mm diameter holes .",
    "the temperature of the oven is measured by a thermocouple in thermal contact with the rear side of the dn16cf flange .",
    "an aluminum plate is placed between the dn40cf and the dn16cf flange to shield the blackbody radiation .",
    "the thermocouple is electrically connected through the dn40cf flange by means of an uhv feedthrough .",
    "schematic view of the experimental setup .",
    "the oven is placed in vacuum and the atomic beam is further collimated by an aperture with radius @xmath21 placed at distances @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively from the nozzle and magneto - optical trapped atoms . an orthogonal laser beam resonant with the strontium transition at @xmath24 nm and horizontally polarized",
    "is used to estimate flux and divergence of the atomic beam by measuring the atomic fluorescence . ]    in our experimental setup ( see fig . [",
    "fig : experimental_setup ] ) the oven is placed in a custom vacuum chamber evacuated by a @xmath25l / s ion pump .",
    "an aperture with radius @xmath26 mm is placed at a distance @xmath27 mm from the nozzle of the oven to further increase the collimation of the atomic beam ( @xmath28mrad ) and to avoid the effusion of strontium toward the optical windows of the vacuum chamber .",
    "the equilibrium pressure in the vacuum chamber at the working oven temperature of @xmath29c is @xmath30 mbar .",
    "in such environment this temperature is reached with a power consumption of @xmath2w ( @xmath31a - @xmath32v ) .",
    "[ fig : thermal_properties ] shows that the measured equilibrium temperature @xmath33 is not linear with the electrical power consumption @xmath34 , since the thermal properties of the used materials depend on temperature and the loss of energy by thermal radiation increases with @xmath35 .",
    "however it is possible to define a total thermal resistance @xmath36 given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the room temperature . at the working temperature of",
    "@xmath39 we experimentally find a thermal resistance @xmath40 .",
    "oven equilibrium temperature as a function of the electrical power consumption .",
    "the oven working temperature of @xmath29c is reached with @xmath2w of power consumption .",
    "the vertical error bars are given by the temperature uncertainty of the thermocouple ( @xmath41c ) . ]",
    "maximum temperature is limited by the thermal shield in aluminum having the melting point at @xmath42c .",
    "however by using stainless - steel it is possible to increase the maximum operating temperature at the @xmath43c level .    in order to evaluate whether the main heat losses are due to conduction or blackbody radiation ( at @xmath29c )",
    "we consider a simplified thermal model of the oven ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal_model ] ) with the aluminum thermal shield at @xmath29c in contact with the environment at @xmath44c ( at distance of @xmath45 mm ) through three stainless - steel supporting rods , one stainless - steel thermocouple and two tantalum heating wires . from the simple expression @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the thermal conductivity",
    ", @xmath48 is the area of the conducting surface , @xmath49 is the temperature difference and @xmath50 is the thickness of the conducting surface separating the two temperatures , we find that the heat conduction loss due to the supporting rods is @xmath51w , thermocouple and heating wires together are at level of @xmath52w .",
    "the main loss is due to the blackbody radiation emitted by the aluminum thermal shield at @xmath29c , given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is total surface area of the thermal shield , @xmath55 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath19 is the emissivity of aluminum . the total estimated power loss is below @xmath56w , close to the measured value @xmath2w .",
    "the latter value can be now put in perspective and we can conclude that the thermal properties of the oven can be further improved by choosing for the thermal shield a material or a surface finishing ( lapping or plating ) with reduced emissivity ( @xmath57 ) .    additionally , compact size and high efficiency of the oven ensure a better control on the blackbody radiation ( bbr ) coming from the hot furnace into the atoms trapping region . in our experimental configuration atoms",
    "are magneto - optical trapped at a distance @xmath58 mm from the cold ( at room temperature ) aperture , leading to a total bbr frequency shift due to the oven , on the strontium clock transition @xmath59 , given in fractional units by @xcite    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the frequency of the strontium clock transition , @xmath62 is the temperature of the oven and @xmath63 is the solid angle under which the atoms see the cold aperture .",
    "remarkably this estimation makes the bbr frequency shift produced by the oven in this configuration completely negligible in the state of art strontium clocks corrections and uncertainty budget @xcite .",
    "the latter is nowadays dominated by the bbr effect of the environment at room temperature and a compact and thermally insulated oven can additionally simplify the heat management of the test chamber ( where the clock spectroscopy is performed ) and improve its temperature homogeneity with a great benefit in the final uncertainty budget of strontium clock .",
    "simplified thermal model of the proposed oven to trace out the origin and nature of the heat losses ( see the text ) . ]",
    "in order to characterize the atomic beam produced by the oven , spectroscopy on the strontium transition @xmath64 at @xmath24 nm ( saturation intensity @xmath65 ) is performed .",
    "a linearly polarized probe beam , with a diameter @xmath66 mm ( @xmath67 ) and an optical power of @xmath68w ( saturation parameter @xmath69 ) , is sent orthogonally with respect to the direction of the atomic beam ( see fig . [",
    "fig : experimental_setup ] ) .",
    "in this linear absorption regime with a single probe beam , the atomic fluorescence signal is measured as a function of the probe frequency ( see fig . [",
    "fig : single_beam_spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "this spectrum is fitted with the sum of six voigt functions , one for each bosonic isotope ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) and hyperfine components of the fermionic @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . by knowing the natural linewidth ( @xmath75 ) , the isotope shifts , hyperfine splittings , relative strengths and the natural abundances @xcite , it is possible to obtain from the fit the remaining five free parameters given by an overall amplitude and offset , a center frequency offset , the gaussian width ( not calibrated ) and more importantly the time / frequency scaling factor to calibrate in frequency our scan . with this calibration",
    "we obtain a full - width - half - maximum of @xmath76 for the @xmath72 peak .",
    "this value essentially depends on the transverse velocity distribution of atoms ( or equivalently to the collimation of the atomic beam ) .",
    "indeed , the limited transit - time of atoms across the probe beam @xmath77 , with @xmath78 the most probable longitudinal speed in an effusive atomic beam @xmath79 ( @xmath80 boltzmann constant , @xmath81 strontium mass ) , corresponds to a fourier - limited frequency width @xmath82 of @xmath83 , that can be neglected . now considering for simplicity just one isotope peak , by assuming a normal transverse velocity distribution @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the velocity standard deviation , the fluorescence signal is given by the voigt profile @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the angular frequency detuning from the resonance @xmath88",
    ", @xmath89 is the modulus of the probe beam wavevector ( here we assumed a perfect orthogonality ) and @xmath90 is the natural linewidth ( in angular frequency ) .",
    "we find from the frequency axis calibration that the fit value of the standard deviation @xmath85 is @xmath91 m/s , from which we obtain the experimental value of the atomic beam collimation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the half width half maximum of the transverse velocity distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transverse_distribution ] ) .",
    "the measured value of the beam collimation is very close to the angular selection given by the presence of the aperture ( @xmath28mrad ) .",
    "( color online ) fluorescence spectrum of the strontium @xmath64 transition ( blue dots ) obtained in an orthogonal crossed - beam spectroscopy with a single probe beam .",
    "the fit function ( red line ) given by the sum of six voigt functions ( adjusted r - square of fit 0.998 ) is used to calibrate the frequency axis .",
    "each voigt peak ( black dashed lines ) represents the contribution of the three bosonic isotopes @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the three hyperfine components of the fermionic @xmath73 .",
    "the error signal associated to the spectrum can be used to frequency stabilize the laser on the atomic transition . ]",
    "such collimated atomic beam is a good tool to frequency stabilize a laser at the mhz level on the strontium transition @xmath64 ( error - signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_beam_spectroscopy ] ) and is thus an alternative to hollow cathode lamps , sealed vapor cells @xcite and split - photodiode technique @xcite .",
    "as the transverse doppler width is comparable to the natural linewidth , the doppler - free saturation spectroscopy on the atomic beam has not advantage with respect to single beam excitation .",
    "for this application the orthogonality between the probe and the atomic beam is critical to avoid any systematic shift @xmath94 between the atomic resonance and the stabilized laser frequency .",
    "the sensitivity to this effect is given by the projection of the most probable longitudinal velocity onto the probing direction @xmath95 where @xmath96(@xmath97 ) represents the angular deviation from the perpendicular to the atomic beam .",
    "the condition of orthogonality ( and zero systematic frequency shift ) is experimentally achieved by maximizing the peak and minimizing the width of the fluorescence signal .",
    "additionally an estimation of the residual systematic shift @xmath94 can be obtained from the width variation when the probe beam is retroreflected and is given by the simple expression @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 represents respectively the width of the fluorescence signal with and without retro - reflection . in our experimental configuration",
    "we find a systematic shift ( modulus ) lower than @xmath101mhz , well below the natural linewidth of the strontium @xmath64 transition ( @xmath102mhz ) .      in order to estimate the atomic flux , the fluorescence peak produced in the orthogonal spectroscopy",

    "the flux of atoms @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) is given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 atomic density .",
    "the latter is related to the measured fluorescence optical peak power @xmath107 ( w ) through @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the interaction volume , @xmath110 is total solid angle of dipole emission , @xmath111 is the solid angle under which the atomic fluorescence is seen by the photodiode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental_setup ] ) and @xmath112 is the reduced planck s constant . at @xmath113",
    "taking into account the contributions of all the strontium isotopes we estimate a total flux of @xmath114 , corresponding to a flow rate of @xmath115 .",
    "since from eq .",
    "[ eq : collimation ] we find that atomic beam divergence ( @xmath116 ) is determined by the cold aperture ( @xmath117 ) and not by the geometry of the capillaries ( @xmath118 @xcite ) , we can define an atomic beam intensity peak ( @xmath119 ) given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the solid angle selection performed by the cold aperture ( see fig . [",
    "fig : experimental_setup ] ) . in order to establish the effusion regime",
    "the atomic beam intensity peak is measured as a function of the oven temperature and is compared with the theoretical calculation in the limit of no collisions occurring in the capillaries ( knudsen regime ) @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are respectively the mean atomic speed and the atomic density in the reservoir , with @xmath125 vapor pressure of strontium given by @xcite @xmath126     semilog plot of the measured atomic beam peak intensity ( dots ) as a function of the oven temperature , in comparison with the theoretical curve ( solid curve ) for a collision - free source .",

    "the disagreement between the experimental and theoretical absolute values of the atomic beam intensity , together with the evidence that the measured atomic beam divergence is larger than the theoretical knudsen regime value @xmath134 @xcite can be both explained by a slightly imperfect mutual alignment of the capillaries . to understand more quantitatively if the reduced intensity is compliant with the measured increased divergence we can assume that for a small misalignment of the capillaries the number of atoms effused in the half - intensity solid angle @xmath135 is the same of ideal case @xmath136 , leading to @xmath137 , which is very close to the measured value .    in our collision - free regime the total flow rate of atoms emitted in the half solid angle by the oven ( @xmath138c )",
