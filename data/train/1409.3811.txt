    "from the time of the seminal paper @xcite of hardy and littlewood , geometric maximal functions have played a central role in analysis . for example",
    ", the hardy - littlewood maximal operator @xmath12 has been used in a proof of the lebesgue differentiation theorem as well as in proofs of the @xmath13 boundedness of a wide class of singular integral operators ; @xcite provides a well - known exposition of these facts .    a key property that the maximal operator @xmath12 satisfies is the so - called _ weak type ( 1,1 ) estimate _ : @xmath14 it is this property that enables us to show that the collection of cubes or balls in @xmath1 differentiates @xmath15 .",
    "now , the _ strong maximal operator _",
    "@xmath16 , defined by taking maximal averages of a function over rectangular parallelepipeds whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes , does not satisfy a weak type @xmath17 condition , although it does satisfy a weak type estimate of the form @xmath18 this weak type estimate can be used to show that the collection of rectangular parallelepipeds whose sides are parallel to the axes differentiates functions that are locally in @xmath19 ; details in this regard may be found in @xcite .    in order to describe more general results along these lines",
    "we introduce some terminology .",
    "a _ basis _",
    "@xmath20 is a collection of bounded open sets in @xmath21 .",
    "a collection @xmath20 is called a _",
    "density basis _ if it differentiates functions in @xmath22 . given a basis @xmath0 we explicitly define the maximal operator @xmath23 by @xmath24 if @xmath25 while we set @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "we use the special notations @xmath27 when @xmath20 is the collection of all euclidean balls in @xmath21 , @xmath28 when @xmath20 is the basis of all cubes in @xmath21 with sides parallel to the coordinate axes , and @xmath16 when @xmath20 consists of all rectangular parallelepipeds in @xmath21 with sides parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "if a maximal operator @xmath23 associated with a basis @xmath0 satisfies a weak type @xmath29 estimate , with @xmath30 being a convex non - negative , non - decreasing function in @xmath31 with @xmath32 , the basis @xmath0 is known to differentiate functions for which @xmath33 is locally integrable . for this reason ,",
    "given a maximal operator @xmath2 , it is highly desirable to place bounds on its distribution function @xmath34 ; that enables us to establish differentiation results for the basis @xmath0 .",
    "a somewhat weaker estimate on a maximal operator is a so - called _",
    "tauberian condition_. a maximal operator @xmath2 associated with a basis @xmath0 is said to satisfy a tauberian condition with respect to @xmath35 if there exists a constant @xmath36 such that @xmath37 holds for all measurable sets @xmath38 .",
    "this condition is quite useful .",
    "crdoba and fefferman related tauberian conditions of maximal operators to @xmath13 bounds of multiplier operators in @xcite , and hagelstein and stokolos showed in @xcite that if @xmath20 is a homothecy invariant basis consisting of convex sets and the maximal operator @xmath23 satisfies a tauberian condition with respect to some @xmath39 then @xmath40 must be bounded on @xmath41 for sufficiently large @xmath42 .",
    "subsequent papers extending these ideas include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ halo function _ @xmath9 associated with a density basis @xmath0 is defined as @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and by convention it is defined as @xmath45 for @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the growth of the halo function @xmath47 as @xmath48 enables us to establish _ weak type bounds _ on @xmath40 ; in particular , if @xmath49 for @xmath50 , then @xmath2 is of restricted weak type @xmath51 and accordingly @xmath0 differentiates all functions which are locally in @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "a prominent unsolved problem in differentiation theory is the _ halo conjecture _ which asserts that if @xmath0 is a homothecy invariant density basis , then @xmath0 must differentiate any measurable function @xmath54 for which @xmath55 is locally integrable .",
    "partial results regarding the halo conjecture may be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", it is the issue of the growth properties of halo functions that has received the majority of attention in the field of differentiation theory in recent decades .",
    "a fundamental but until recently overlooked issue is that of _ continuity and smoothness _ of halo functions .",
    "beznosova and hagelstein proved in @xcite that the halo function of a density basis must be continuous on @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath5 .",
    "however , they also provided an example of a density basis consisting of nonconvex sets whose halo function exhibits a jump discontinuity at 1 .",
    "these results immediately motivate a closer study of the behavior of halo functions near @xmath57 .",
    "the first results in this regard are due to a. a. solyanik , who proved in @xcite that the halo functions associated with the centered hardy - littlewood maximal operator and the strong maximal operator tend to @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "similar estimates were shown for the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator , defined with respect to balls , by hagelstein and parissis in @xcite , and analogues of these results were proved in the weighted case by hagelstein and parissis in @xcite .",
    "our previous work on solyanik estimates was motivated primarily out of intrinsic interest .",
    "however , michael lacey has subsequently brought to our attention that he and sarah ferguson implicitly used solyanik - type estimates for the strong maximal operator in their work establishing a commutator estimate enabling one to give a characterization of the product bmo space @xmath59 of chang and r. fefferman in terms of commutators ; see the appendix of their paper @xcite .",
    "two other papers where solyanik - type estimates were implicitly used include @xcite by cabrelli , lacey , molter , and pipher as well as @xcite by lacey and terwilliger .",
    "given a density basis @xmath0 it will be convenient for us to define the _ sharp tauberian constant @xmath60 _ by @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "in particular @xmath63 recall that if a density basis @xmath0 is homothecy invariant then @xmath60 is always finite for @xmath64 ; see @xcite .",
    "a more precise quantitative version of the solyanik estimates discussed above , collectively due to hagelstein , parissis , and solyanik , is the following .",
    "@xcite[t.t1 ] let @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 denote the sharp tauberian constants for the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator with respect to balls , the uncentered hardy - littlewood maximal operator with respect to cubes , and the strong maximal operator , respectively .",
    "then we have the following asymptotic estimates for @xmath35 sufficiently close to @xmath57 : @xmath68    the estimates for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are sharp in the sense that the exponent @xmath69 can not be replaced by any larger exponent . whether or not the exponent associated with @xmath65 can be improved to @xmath69 or possibly @xmath70 is an open problem ; see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the above quantitative _ solyanik estimates _ may be used to establish hlder continuity results for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath71 , and accordingly yield hlder continuity results for the corresponding halo functions .",
    "we will moreover see that , given a homothecy invariant density basis @xmath0 consisting of convex sets , a solyanik estimate of the form @xmath72 implies that @xmath9 lies in the hlder class @xmath73 .",
    "a key ingredient of the proof of this result will be the careful use of the caldern - zygmund decomposition to show that _ halo sets _ of the form @xmath74 satisfy an imbedding relation @xmath75 whenever @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 is a dimensional constant .",
    "in this paper we will make frequent use of the following notational conventions .",
    "we write @xmath79 for numerical constants that can change value even in the same line of text .",
    "the presence of a subscript as in @xmath80 denotes dependence on some parameter @xmath81 .",
    "we write @xmath82 whenever @xmath83 for some constant @xmath84 and @xmath85 if @xmath82 and @xmath86 .",
    "we write @xmath87 whenever the implied constant depends on the parameter @xmath81 , and @xmath88 if @xmath87 and @xmath89 .",
    "also , given an interval @xmath90 , we say that a function @xmath54 lies in the hlder class @xmath91 whenever for any compact set @xmath92 we have @xmath93 for all @xmath94 .",
    "this condition corresponds to @xmath54 being _ locally hlder continuous _ with exponent @xmath42 in @xmath95 .",
    "we are following here the notation and terminology found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "we many times refer to a rectangular parallelepiped @xmath96 as a _ rectangle _ in @xmath21 .",
    "any rectangle @xmath96 gives rise to a dyadic grid consisting of homothetic copies of @xmath96 simply by bisecting each side of @xmath96 and iterating .",
    "thus any @xmath96 gives rise to @xmath97 _ dyadic children _ and any dyadic descendant @xmath98 of @xmath96 is contained in a unique _ dyadic parent _ that we always denote by @xmath99 .",
    "in this section we provide the statement and proof of the following theorem regarding the embedding of halo sets associated with bases of rectangular parallelepipeds .",
