    "interestingly , it turns out that the particle perfectly maintains the amplitude of its motion because the exact solution of ( [ small_diff ] ) , constrained by @xmath169 from ( [ 3gp ] ) , is @xmath170 additionally , we stress the fact that _ this solution is valid for any smooth @xmath63 dependence _ and not just ( [ q_od_t ] ) . in particular , in the opposite limit when @xmath63 decreases in time the `` anti - friction '' term works as a special friction term that slows the particle down so that it oscillates with constant amplitude instead of spreading out .",
    "this phenomenon can be qualitatively explained as follows .",
    "as it happens at @xmath164 we can safely assume that the magnon modes of the system do not become excited any more during driving .",
    "this is so because they have energy gap that becomes large far away from the critical point .",
    "these modes are responsible for the scattering of atoms between @xmath171 and @xmath172 condensate components @xcite . in the absence of that process",
    "the populations of @xmath30 sublevels should be constant , which implies that @xmath173 will undergo _ fixed _ amplitude oscillations induced by rotation of the condensate phases .",
    "in this section we would like to compare the results obtained from a single mode approximation enforcing the translational symmetry onto wave - function of the system to the more experimentally relevant inhomogeneous ( `` disordered '' ) problem .",
    "to this aim we assume that the atom cloud is placed in a box - like trap and impose density and phase fluctuations onto it .",
    "these may come from experimental imperfections and quantum fluctuations .",
    "the results presented here come from numerics done in a one - dimensional configuration and so we present an explicitly 1d description below unless stated otherwise .",
    "we consider untrapped system : atoms in the box as in the experiment @xcite done with spinless bosons .",
    "we estimate the parameters for these 1d simulations as in @xcite taking into account the experimental setup of @xcite .",

    "we introduce disorder by modifying the initial wave function at @xmath176 in the following way : @xmath177 where the mode amplitude is proportional to : @xmath178 there @xmath179 gives the strength of the disorder , @xmath180 are random phases , @xmath181 $ ] are random amplitudes , and @xmath182 $ ] are random positions of gaussian disturbances .",
    "all these parameters are generated with uniform probability density .",
    "we have chosen @xmath183 to be equal to the spin healing length @xmath184 and assumed that the average spacing between gaussian perturbations is @xmath185 .",
    "the spin healing length in the experiment @xcite is @xmath186 , so that @xmath187 , the number of gaussians in ( [ disorder ] ) , is about @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the meaning of @xmath179 is that it provides a characteristic relative - to - background size of density variations . a typical disordered pattern in ( [ disorder ] )",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ disorder1 ] .",
    "now our goal is to answer what is the range of the @xmath179 parameter that allows for observation of qualitatively the same physics as in the homogeneous system described in secs .",

    "the patterns are independently generated for every evolution , which shall resemble the experimental situation where the structure of `` imperfections '' fluctuates from run to run .",
    "then for each pair @xmath192 we average the mean system magnetization over @xmath193 runs , @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the condensate transverse magnetization in the @xmath196-th run .",
    "we look at two quantities : the distance @xmath197 from the critical point where the system starts the non - adiabatic evolution due to approaching the critical point , and the scaling of the condensate magnetization at the critical point . both are defined in the same way as in sec .",

    "our results suggest that the scaling exponents in the disordered system can match the sma predictions within a few percent accuracy for @xmath199 .",
    "quantitatively , as we see in table [ table ] , the scaling exponent @xmath200 given by @xmath201 stays reasonably close to the @xmath79 value for the homogeneous system for @xmath179 as large as @xmath202 . for larger @xmath179 , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath203 the numerical data clearly departs from the power law .",

    "second , our prediction of the scaling exponents is based on translationally invariant theory , i.e. , momentum @xmath212 problem , while the introduction of disorder leads to population of @xmath213 modes .",
    "a more involved description with the gap @xmath2 ( [ ddd ] ) being a function of @xmath214 should be used when the population of @xmath213 modes becomes significant .    .",

    "arrows indicate which inset belongs to what box .",
    "the initial state for that evolution is the same as in fig .",
    "[ stop2_disorder ] . ]",
    "now we would like to look at the system dynamics in the polar phase . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we have observed that the transverse magnetization undergoes periodic oscillations in a homogeneous problem after stop of driving .",
    "now we see dephasing dynamics spoiling this picture after a time inversely proportional to the disorder magnitude and the quench time @xmath19 .",
    "the latter observation results from the fact that the slower we go at fixed @xmath179 , the more significant the disorder is compared to the system magnetization in the polar phase .",
    "[ stop2_disorder ] presents the evolution with @xmath219 and @xmath216 .",
    "the change of @xmath0 stops at the critical point there .",
    "for these parameters the scaling exponents are very close to the single mode approximation result ( see table [ table ] ) . as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stop2_disorder ] , however , dephasing takes place after about @xmath220 oscillations . to observe more magnetization oscillations closely following the sma result , for twice that time",
    ", @xmath179 has to be about one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "therefore , the system dynamics is quite sensitive to inhomogeneities when the condensate is left at the critical point .",
    "this should result from the coupling between different @xmath214 modes due to nonlinear terms in the evolution equation .",
    "[ stop3_disorder ] presents the evolution where driving stops at @xmath142 ( similarly as in fig .",
    "[ dampl ] ) .",
    "the parameters and the initial state taken for this simulation are the same as in fig .",
    "[ stop2_disorder ] .",
    "this time the undriven dynamics takes place in the regime where nonlinear couplings are small . as a result",
    ", the dephasing occurs after hundreds of oscillations even though the disorder amplitude , @xmath216 , is the same as in fig .",
    "[ stop2_disorder ] .    to explain dephasing",
    "when the evolution stops away from a critical point , we can linearize the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "below we do it in an explicitly 3d configuration to use the same notation as in secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] ( the 1d result is qualitatively the same ) .",

    "is given by @xmath227 where the last term is known from ( [ xxx ] ) . that can be solved by the substitution @xmath228 , giving @xmath229 where @xmath230 . when disorder is present , different @xmath214 modes will be occupied and they will oscillate at different frequencies @xmath231 , which will result in the dephasing observed in fig .",
    "[ stop3_disorder ] .",
    "the expression for @xmath231 shall not be used at @xmath87 , where linearized theory fails as was shown within the sma in sec .",
    "we have analyzed transitions from the broken - symmetry phase to the polar phase occurring on the finite timescale @xmath19 .",
    "our focus was on slow transitions , when the condensate goes out of equilibrium near a critical point .",
    "we have presented a simple theory predicting that the evolution will cease to be adiabatic before reaching the polar phase at the distance @xmath232 from the critical point .",
    "this result was found to be in excellent agreement with numerics . applying the basic assumptions of the adiabatic - impulse approach @xcite , which originates from the kibble - zurek theory of nonequilibrium dynamics of classical phase transitions @xcite ,",
    "we have explained why the transverse magnetization of the condensate driven to the critical point scales as @xmath86 as well .",
    "subsequently we have analyzed how the latter result can be experimentally extracted from the observation of magnetization oscillations .",
    "three cases were considered .",
    "first , we have studied what happens when the quench stops at the critical point and the system follows free evolution .",
    "it was shown that the periodic oscillations appear with the repetition period coupled to the amplitude of transverse magnetization oscillations .",
    "the repetition period was found to scale as @xmath129 , where the exponent was directly related to the scaling of the transverse magnetization at the critical point .",
    "that nonlinear dynamics was exactly described within the mean - field approach in terms of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "second , we have studied what happens when the system is driven into the polar phase , and then undergoes a free evolution . in that case",
    "we have shown that its excitation at the critical point can be easily extracted from the scaling of the amplitude of the free magnetization oscillations given by @xmath14 .",
    "third , we have studied what happens when the condensate is driven without any interruptions not only in the broken - symmetry phase , but also in the polar phase . in this case",
    "the amplitude of driven magnetization oscillations reaches a non - zero asymptotic value : the condensate magnetization is described as an unusual harmonic oscillator with anti - friction term that perfectly cancels the squeezing induced by the increase of the harmonic oscillator frequency .",
    "all the above results were obtained within a translationally invariant single mode approximation whose range of applicability was determined by introducing a controlled disorder into an initial wave function . we have found out that the amount of disorder has to be quite small to have the homogeneous system predictions applicable .",
    "future extensions of this work will include studies of quantum phase transitions dynamics in a harmonically trapped ferromagnetic condensate and investigations of the role of quantum fluctuations on the condensate dynamics .",
