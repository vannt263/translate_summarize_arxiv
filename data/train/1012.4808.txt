    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the susy completion of the technicolor sector . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss a susy model in which the strong dynamics in the top sector arises from strong dynamics in the third generation ( `` topcolor '' ) . in section 4",
    ", we discuss a susy model in which all three generations are treated equally . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the phenomenology at the tev scale , particularly the pngbs .",
    "section 6 contains some remarks on cosmology , and section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we describe the technicolor sector above the susy breaking scale @xmath28 , and how this matches onto minimal conformal technicolor below @xmath28 .",
    "this sector is the same for both models of the strong top dynamics that we discuss below .",
    "the gauge group is su(3)_sctc su(2)_l su(2)_r with @xmath23 .",
    "the fields in the technicolor sector are & ~(3 , 2 , 1 ) , + & ~(|3 , 1 , 2 ) , + _ a & ~(3 , 1 , 1 ) , + _ a & ~(|3 , 1 , 1 ) , with @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 has 6 flavors , and therefore has a maximally strongly - coupled ( self - dual ) conformal fixed point @xcite .",
    "the technicolor gauge group has been extended from @xmath0 to @xmath39 for two reasons .",
    "the first has to do with the anomalous dimensions of mass - squared terms for technicolored scalars .",
    "mass - squared terms proportional to anomaly - free flavor symmetry generators are not renormalized , while all other mass - squared terms are suppressed @xcite . therefore ,",
    "some of the technicolored scalars have negative mass - squared at the scale @xmath28 , and hence partial breaking of the technicolor gauge symmetry is inevitable . actually ,",
    "because the technicolor gauge group is at a strongly coupled fixed point , we can not rigorously conclude that the gauge group is spontaneously broken . here and throughout this paper",
    "we make the dynamical assumption that strongly - coupled broken susy theories such as this are in the same universality class as a weakly - coupled theory with the same gauge group and matter content .",
    "the second reason the gauge group is extended is that the partial breaking of the strong gauge group fixes a mismatch between the number of colors and flavors required for a strong fixed point . for a strong susy fixed point ,",
    "we want @xmath45 , while for a non - susy fixed point we probably want @xmath46 .",
    "the latter estimate is very uncertain .",
    "it is suggested by a number of lattice studies for @xmath47 @xcite ( but see also ) , and agrees with model estimates @xcite .",
    "we assume vevs of the form , = that break @xmath48 at the @xmath28 .",
    "below @xmath28@xmath24 has 7 light fermion flavors ( as we will explain below ) , roughly where we expect a strong conformal fixed point .",
    "there are an odd number of @xmath49 doublets in , so there is a global gauge anomaly .",
    "we cancel this by adding the `` partner '' fields p & ~(1 , 2 , 1 ) , + & ~(1 , 1 , 2 ) .",
    "the fields @xmath50 do not cancel any gauge anomaly , but they give rise to dirac fermion masses , as we will see .",
    "the higher dimension operators that give masses to quarks and leptons arise from the exchange of heavy electroweak doublet scalars .",
    "these have the quantum numbers of the mssm higgs fields , namely ~(1 , 2 , 2 ) .",
    "these fields have positive mass - squared , and therefore do not get vevs at the scale @xmath28 .",
    "we will refer to these fields as `` flavor messengers . ''",
    "writing out the @xmath51 doublets explicitly , the relevant fields have @xmath52 quantum numbers & ~(3 , 2)_0 , + _ 1 & ~(|3 , 1)_12 , + _ 2 & ~(|3 , 1)_-12 , + _ 1 & ~(1 , 2)_12 , + _ 2 & ~(1 , 2)_-12 .",

    "@xmath55 couples to the top quark . as discussed in the introduction , explaining the large value of the top quark mass requires that @xmath56 must be strong at the scale @xmath28 .",
    "below , we will demonstrate that this is not necessarily a coincidence . in section",
    "[ sec : strongyukhid ] , we will show that a mechanism similar to the giudice - masiero mechanism for the @xmath57 term @xcite can naturally generate relevant interactions of this kind that get strong at @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , in section [ sec : strongyukfix ] , we will show that it is very plausible that relevant yukawa couplings , such as in , run to a fixed point when they become strong .",
    "susy breaking automatically gives masses to all scalars , but fermion masses must arise from superpotential couplings .",
    "the `` 3rd technicolor '' components of the fermions in @xmath58 and @xmath59 get masses with the `` partner '' fields @xmath60 and @xmath50 via the superpotential interactions w = y_p p + y _ . at the strong fixed point , the operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 have dimension @xmath63 , so the couplings @xmath64 have dimension @xmath65 . these particles carry electroweak quantum numbers , so their mass must be larger than of order @xmath66 .",
    "this means that we must require y_p , y _",
    "@xmath28 ^ 1/2 .",
    "the same mechanism that explains why the couplings in are strong near the scale @xmath28  can work for the couplings @xmath67 as well , leading to masses of these fields near @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath44 gaugino has a majorana mass term from susy breaking , but the majorana mass operator @xmath68 has scaling dimension @xmath69 from the strong conformal dynamics @xcite . the simplest susy breaking scenarios have susy broken at an energy scale much larger than @xmath28 , with susy breaking communicated to the hidden sector by weak interactions . in this case , the majorana mass term will be strongly suppressed compared to other susy breaking terms at @xmath28 .",
    "the vevs , , that break @xmath44 are of order @xmath28 , and give a mass to the @xmath44 gauginos corresponding to broken gauge generators due to the super - higgs mechanism .",
    "there is one linear combination of the @xmath24 singlet fermions in @xmath70 that is left massless .",
    "( this can be understood from a counting argument : there are @xmath71 broken generators , but there are 6 fermions in @xmath70 . )",
    "this fermion can get mass from superpotential interactions of the form w ~(^ ) ^2 .",
    "this operator has dimension 4 at the fixed point .",
    "this means that it can naturally be unsuppressed at the scale @xmath28and give rise to masses of order @xmath28 .",
    "we also need small mass terms for sterile fermions to softly break conformal symmetry at the tev scale .",
    "these arise from the superpotential couplings w ~+ where the @xmath44 indices are contracted with an epsilon symbol .",
    "similarly , we may also require fermion masses for the technifermions in @xmath58 and @xmath59 to control the vacuum alignment below the electroweak breaking scale @xcite .",
    "such masses can arise from w ~+ .",
    "these terms have dimension @xmath72 , and are therefore also relevant .",

    "we now discuss whether it is a coincidence for the relevant couplings in and to be at or near their strong coupling values at @xmath28 .",
    "this may be viewed as analogous to the @xmath57 problem in the mssm , which also requires a relevant supersymmetric interaction to be important at the scale of susy breaking . in this subsection , we present a simple model of hidden sector susy breaking that naturally explains this coincidence using a mechanism similar to the giudice - masiero mechanism for the @xmath57 problem .",
    "we assume that susy is broken in the hidden sector by a chiral superfield @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "we assume the usual couplings between @xmath73 and the visible sector fields k ~ x^x q^q + where @xmath75is the planck scale .",
    "these give rise to visible sector susy breaking at the scale @xmath28~. suppose that in addition the hidden sector has a field @xmath76 with ~^1/2 , ^1/2 @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath77 corresponds to the scale of susy breaking dynamics , this is very natural as we will see below . a coupling between the hidden and visible sectors of the form w ~ y _ 2 _ 1 then generates an effective yukawa coupling y_tc1 ~ ~@xmath28 ^ 1/2 .",
    "this is just what we require in order for the yukawa coupling to be strong at the scale @xmath28 .",
    "the second condition in ensures that visible sector susy breaking from @xmath78 is no larger than @xmath28 .    a simple hidden sector that accomplishes this has a superpotential w = x + y^4 .",
    "note that this preserves a @xmath79 symmetry under which @xmath80 .",
    "we are looking for vevs of the form with @xmath81 , so we can expand around @xmath82 in inverse powers of @xmath83 .",
    "in this case , a theorem due to weinberg @xcite guarantees that if there is a vacuum with the desired properties in the global susy limit , turning on sugra corrections will only perturb the vevs .",
    "we therefore analyze the potential neglecting sugra corrections .",
    "the most general @xmath79 invariant potential is therefore k & = x^x + y^y + & + + & + ( @xmath75 ^ -3 ) . where we have omitted holomorphic terms .",
    "the potential is then v = + ( @xmath75 ^ -3 ) . assuming c_xx < 0 , c_xy > 0 , the potential is minimized for = 0 , ||^2 = - , which implies = , = ~ ~^1/2@xmath28for @xmath84 .",
    "if we ignore sugra corrections , this theory has a massless `` @xmath85-axion '' from the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath86 symmetry under which @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "when we include sugra corrections , a crucial ingredient is the addition of a constant term in the superpotential to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "this explicitly breaks @xmath86 and gives rise to a mass for the @xmath85-axion @xcite .",
    "of course there can be other sources of explicit @xmath86 breaking that also contribute to the @xmath85-axion mass .",
    "the conformal fixed point is no longer exact when a relevant coupling like @xmath56 is nonzero .",
    "the strength of such couplings grows in the ir , and causes the theory to flow away from the original fixed point .",
    "a natural possibility is that the theory flows to a new fixed point where the coupling @xmath56 is itself at a strong fixed point value .",
    "there is a highly nontrivial consistency check on this hypothesis from `` @xmath89 maximization '' @xcite .",
    "provided that the superconformal @xmath86 symmetry can be identified with an anomaly - free @xmath86 symmetry acting on fundamental fields , the quantity a = ( 3 r^3 - r ) is maximized over all allowed values of the @xmath85 charges .",
    "this allows one to find the dimensions of all chiral operators for a claimed fixed point .",
    "these dimensions must be physical , for example the dimension of scalar operators must be @xmath90 .",
    "the complete theory has strong dynamics in both the technicolor and the strong sector , and the strong yukawa coupling for the top quark means that these sectors are also strongly coupled to each other .",
    "nonetheless , we will discuss the possible new fixed point in the technicolor sector to illustrate the main points in a simpler setting .",
    "we consider the case where only the coupling @xmath56 is strong . here",
    ", we must maximize @xmath89 subject to the condition @xmath91 .",

    "this is to be compared with the fixed point for small @xmath56 , in which @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we see that the dimensions of the strongly interacting fields have shifted only slightly , while the field @xmath55 has a large anomalous dimension in the new fixed point .",
    "all gauge - invariant operators have physical dimensions , and no scalar field has a dimension near 1 , which is consistent with a strongly interacting fixed point .    because the field @xmath55 has dimension larger than 1 at the new fixed point , weakly coupled yukawa interactions involving @xmath55 are _ irrelevant _ interactions at the new fixed point .",

    "it transforms as + 2 f_where @xmath239 is the decay constant of the pngb .",
    "the field @xmath230 is @xmath29-odd , so @xmath230 and @xmath238 will mix in general .",
    "the potential for the pngbs arises from interactions that explicitly break the @xmath240 symmetry .",
    "we follow and consider the case where the pngb potential is dominated by top quark loops and technifermion mass terms . justification and more detailed discussion of the potential",
    "can be found in that paper .",
    "we focus on the @xmath29-odd pngbs , since the potential for @xmath237 is unchanged from .",
    "the technifermion mass terms break @xmath228 , and therefore give mass to the @xmath230 .",
    "defining k = , the leading term in the potential is v_mass & = 14 _ ( ^t ) e^i / f _ + + & = _ . here",
    "we assume that @xmath106 are real , and _ ~.    the potential due to top quark loops does not break @xmath228 , and is therefore the same as in .",
    "minimizing the total effective potential with respect to @xmath237 gives = , where @xmath241 is an effective lagrangian coefficient given by c_t ~. combining this with the estimate of the top quark mass , we find m_h^2 = c_t n_c m_t^2 with @xmath242 .",
    "the @xmath238-@xmath230 mass matrix is then v_eff = 12 ^t , where r_= , r_= .",
    "the potential has a minimum at @xmath243 provided that @xmath244 .",
    "the mass eigenstates are = , where = 12 ( -x + ) , x = .",
    "the mass eigenvalues are m^2_a_2 , a_1 = .",
    "note that m_a_1 ^ 2 ( 1 - r_^2 ) , so there is always one mass eigenstate lighter that @xmath245 , the value of the @xmath29-odd pngb mass in the model without the light @xmath101 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) where @xmath248 one linear combination of @xmath238 and @xmath230 is massless , as can be easily seen from the determinant of the mass matrix .",
    "this arises because the mass terms preserve an anomaly - free @xmath249 symmetry in this limit , namely ( for @xmath250 ) e^-i , e^-2i , .",
    "this limit is therefore completely natural . in this limit , the mass eigenvalues are m^2_a_2 & ( 1 + r_^2 ^2 ) , + m^2_a_1 & ( 1 - r_^2 ) , where 1 - r_^2 =    -4/ & if @xmath251 , -4/ & if @xmath252 .",
    "we now consider the couplings of the @xmath29-odd pngbs .",
    "the @xmath238 field has suppressed couplings to fermions due to the @xmath231 custodial symmetry . specifically , we have @xcite g_a|ff ~v n_c ( ) ^2 r _ .",
    "the first factor is the `` going rate '' for a pngb with decay constant @xmath253 , while the second factor is typically @xmath254 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath230 field has unsuppressed couplings to fermions via the operator that generates fermion masses : _ eff & = m_f f e^i / f _ + + & = m_f |f f + |f i_5 f + , where the @xmath230 dependence is dictated by the fact that the mass operator breaks @xmath228 by 2 units . neglecting the suppressed coupling of @xmath238 to fermions we obtain couplings g_a_2 |ff & = - r _ , + g_a_1 |ff & = r _ , it does not appear natural to have either @xmath255 or @xmath256 very small , and small @xmath257 is the fine - tuned standard model limit .",
    "therefore , these couplings are generally comparable to the corresponding standard model yukawa couplings .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for single @xmath29-odd pngbs at a hadron collider is therefore gluon fusion with a top loop or associated production with @xmath258 .",
    "the dominant decay is to the heaviest kinematically allowed fermion pair , just like the @xmath29-odd higgs fields in multi - higgs models .",
    "this is challenging at the lhc , associated production with @xmath258 and a boosted @xmath259 may be possible , since this is similar to the analogous higgs search discussed in .",
    "this has the possibility to measure the coupling of the scalar to the top quark , and can therefore distinguish between the @xmath259 and the higgs .",
    "another possibility is pair production of @xmath29-odd pngbs via heavy resonances associated with the strong dynamics at the scale @xmath42 .",
    "this is similar to strong double higgs production in composite higgs scenarios , which may require very high integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "we intend to investigate these signals in future work .",
    "in this section , we make some brief remarks about the cosmology of these models .",
    "as written , the models have serious cosmological problems if the reheat temperature of the universe is larger than @xmath260 .",
    "the reason is the theory at the scale @xmath35 contains resonances with half - integer charge , for example resonances with the quantum numbers @xmath261 or @xmath262 ( see ) .",
    "such particles are necessarily absolutely stable , since there is no final state that they can decay to .",
    "these particles are strongly interacting at the scale @xmath42 , and therefore have have large annihilation cross sections .",
    "if their present cosmic abundance is determined by thermal freeze - out , their abundance is somewhat less than that of dark matter .",
    "nonetheless , it is almost certain that such particles are ruled out by the many constraints on charged stable matter .",
    "for example , direct searches for the flux of fractionally charged particles @xmath73 at the earth give a limit @xmath263 @xcite , many orders of magnitude less than the expected flux for dark matter _",
    "x ~10 ^ 8  ^-2 ^ -1 ( ) ( ) ^-1 .",
    "see for additional constraints .    we can change the hypercharge assignments to eliminate half - integer charged particles at the scale @xmath42 .",
    "for example , we can assign the particles @xmath264 in hypercharge @xmath265 . in this case",
    ", the particles that previously had half - integer charges are still stable if we add no additional interactions , but higher - dimension interactions can be added to allow them to decay .",
    "however , we then find that the susy model discussed in section [ sec : susyctc ] has half - integer charges that can not be eliminated by changing the hypercharge assignments .",
    "we suspect that susy completions can be found without fractionally charged particles , but we will not pursue this here .",
    "a simple solution to these difficulties is to assume that the universe has a reheat temperature low enough that the troublesome particles discussed above are never in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this means a temperature below the temperature where they would normally freeze out , of order 100  gev for particles at the scale @xmath42 .",
    "this preserves the successes of big - bang nucleosynthesis , the highest temperature direct experimental test of cosmology .",
    "a cosmology with a low reheat temperature does not allow standard mechanisms for dark matter and baryogenesis , but there are simple and plausible mechanisms in the literature that can be used in the present context @xcite .",
    "we leave a full investigation of the cosmology of these models to future work .",
    "we have constructed complete models of flavor that reduce to minimal conformal technicolor at low energies .",
    "the models are based on supersymmetry broken at a high scale @xmath27 , and generate the required higher - dimension operators via heavy scalar exchange .",
    "we have argued that such a theory requires strong ( super)conformal dynamics at the scale @xmath28 in both the technicolor and the top sector . in such a model ,",
    "the top quark mass is given by m_t ~4v ( ) ^d-1 where @xmath7 is the dimension of the `` higgs '' operator in the theory above the scale @xmath266 , and @xmath267 for a composite higgs model .",
    "we argued that the models are safe from flavor - changing neutral currents for @xmath176 . saturating this bound",
    ", the observed value of the top quark mass can be obtained with @xmath268 for @xmath19 .",
    "vacuum misalignment ( @xmath269 ) can relax these bounds even more .",
    "the models have a number of desirable features .",
    "most importantly , there are only two mass scales in the theory , the susy breaking scale @xmath28and the scale @xmath270 where conformal symmetry is broken and chiral symmetry breaking takes place . both of these scales arise naturally , with no fine - tuning .",
    "nontrivial susy fixed points or generalizations of the giudice - masiero mechanism can explain why supersymmetric mass terms are near the susy breaking scale , so that all unwanted fermions naturally get a mass of order @xmath28 .",
    "another interesting result of this work is that this class of models makes a robust prediction for physics below the tev scale , namely the existence of an additional @xmath249 pngb .",
    "this has couplings similar to a pseudoscalar higgs , and may be observable using jet substructure techniques .",
    "a less attractive feature of the specific models we present is that they require additional nontrivial flavor structure .",
    "this arises from the sector responsible for making the top quark strongly interacting at the susy breaking scale . for the `` topcolor models '' of section  [ sec : stopcolor ] ,",
    "additional flavor - dependent couplings are required to mix third generation quarks with the first two generation . for the `` extended color '' models of section  [ sec : susyec ]",
    "additional flavor dependent couplings are required to give mass to the extra quark colors .",
    "the need for this additional flavor structure arises for technical reasons , and is not obviously inherent in our approach .",
    "specifically we require that the strong color group @xmath271 gauge group have @xmath272 flavors in order to be at a strong ( self - dual ) conformal fixed point . in the `` topcolor '' model of section",
    "[ sec : stopcolor ] the strong color group is @xmath39 , but this is not strong if all 3 generations feel the strong color force . in the `` extended color '' model of section  [ sec : susyec ]",
    "we extend the strong color group to @xmath40 , but then we need additional flavor - dependent couplings to eliminate the extra colors of quarks .",
    "all this depends on a `` higgs '' picture of the dynamics where we identify the fundamental degrees of freedom with the composite quarks that emerge below the susy breaking scale .",
    "this picture allows us to construct specific models , but it is quite possible that there are strongly coupled conformal theories with 3 generations of composite fermions that do not require flavor - dependent interactions beyond the usual yukawa couplings .",
    "finding such models would be very interesting .",
    "however , the details of the models should not distract from the fact that this work gives the first concrete proposal for a realistic and uv complete dynamics of flavor in a theory of strong electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we believe that this removes a significant barrier to taking this class of theories seriously as a framework for new physics at the tev scale .",
