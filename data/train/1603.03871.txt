    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the planar domains that minimize the principal harmonic frequency ( i.e. , the lowest dirichlet eigenvalue of the negative laplacian or the base frequency of the drum of this shape ) subject to a hard constraint on the perimeter defined using a general norm .",
    "let us introduce the problem and state our results on it first and leave the discussion of our motivation as well as connections to existing literature to a later section .",
    "we will consider the following class of admissible domains @xmath2 note that each  @xmath3 is open , bounded , connected and simply connected with  @xmath4 being the trace of a simple closed curve .",

    "our main result concerning this problem is as follows :    [ thm-0 ] for any choice of the norm  @xmath10 , the functional @xmath18 achieves its minimum on  @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the minimizer is unique modulo translates : there is @xmath20 such that @xmath21 the set @xmath22 is convex and has all symmetries of  @xmath9 that preserve  @xmath10 .    to see that this does resolve also the problem with the hard constraint on the perimeter we note that the sheer existence of a minimizer  @xmath22 of  @xmath23 implies @xmath24 in light of and the scaling relations @xmath25 where @xmath26 , every minimizer of  @xmath15 subject to  @xmath16 is then a translate of  @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "a natural next problem is the determination of the shape  @xmath22 for specific choices of  @xmath10 . here",
    "are three examples where  @xmath22 can explicitly be found :    1 .",
    "@xmath10 : = euclidean norm @xmath29 @xmath22 = a euclidean ball , 2 .",

    "however , the above examples are very special and the connection fails in general :    [ prop-1.2 ] there exists a norm  @xmath10 on  @xmath9 such that the minimizer  @xmath22 is not homothetic to the ( unique ) minimizer of  .",
    "in fact , if the norm is smooth outside the origin and  @xmath43 is @xmath44 , then the minimizers of and are homothetic if and only if  @xmath22 is a euclidean ball and  @xmath10 is proportional to the euclidean norm",
    ".    one can also wonder about the analytic form of the dependence of the minimizer of  @xmath22 on the underlying norm  @xmath10 .",
    "related to this is the question whether , and by what quantitative means , the near minimizers are close to the actual minimizers .",
    "we will measure this closeness using the hausdorff metric @xmath45 where  @xmath46 will henceforth denote the euclidean norm on  @xmath9 .",
    "we then have :    [ thm-1 ] recall the notation  @xmath47 from . for each @xmath48",
    "there is @xmath49 such that , for each @xmath3 , @xmath50 moreover , if we center  @xmath22 so that @xmath51 and then regard it as an element of the metric space  @xmath52 and  @xmath10 as an element of the space of continuous functions on the unit ( euclidean ) sphere in  @xmath9 endowed with the supremum norm , then  @xmath22 depends continuously on  @xmath10 .",
    "we remark that is analogous to the bonnesen inequality known from the context of the isoperimetric problem .",
    "( a formulation of this inequality for perimeters defined using a general norm has been given by dobrushin , koteck and shlosman  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2 ) . )",
    "the only quantitative connection we know of between the shape and the norm requires passage through the corresponding eigenfunction ( see remarks  [ rem1][rem2 ] ) and thus remains quite inexplicit .",
    "our next item of concern is the appearance of facets and corners on the boundary of  @xmath22 . here",
    "a _ facet _ is a maximal ( with respect to inclusion ) non - trivial closed linear segment contained in  @xmath43 .",
    "a _ corner _ is in turn a point on  @xmath43 , regarded as an oriented curve , where the unit tangent vector undergoes a jump .",
    "( by convexity of  @xmath22 , the left and right unit tangent is well defined at all points of  @xmath43 . )",
    "we will link the facets of  @xmath22 to ( what we will call ) _ degenerate directions _ of  @xmath10 . to define this concept , fix  @xmath10 and let @xmath53 and  @xmath54 be two orthogonal unit vectors . by the triangle inequality ,",
    "the function @xmath55 is convex and so the one - sided derivatives @xmath56 are well defined . as an immediate consequence of the definitions we obtain @xmath57 and",
    "if we mark the dependence on  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 explicitly as @xmath58 , we also have @xmath59 in particular , the difference @xmath60 is preserved under the reversal of the orientation of any ( or both ) of the vectors  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 .",
    "we now put forward :    let  @xmath53 be a unit vector and @xmath54 a unit vector orthogonal to  @xmath53 .",
    "given a norm  @xmath10 on  @xmath9 , we say that  @xmath53 is _ degenerate for  @xmath10 _ if @xmath61    we then claim :    [ prop-2.12 ] let  @xmath20 be the ( unique , convex ) minimizing shape of  @xmath18 for  @xmath23 defined using a norm  @xmath10 .",
    "let  @xmath53 be a unit vector in  @xmath9 .",
    "then the curve constituting @xmath43 contains a non - trivial linear segment in the direction of  @xmath53 if and only if  @xmath53 is degenerate for  @xmath10 .",
    "as is easy to check , the @xmath30-norm has @xmath62 as its degenerate directions , and this will remain in effect even when we add an arbitrary norm to the @xmath30-norm . by adding appropriately weighted rotations of the @xmath30-norm , we can thus construct a norm whose minimizing shape will have infinitely many facets .",
    "let us now move to the appearance of corners . pick @xmath3 and let @xmath63 be the parameterization of  @xmath4 by the _",
    "euclidean _ arc - length in the counterclockwise direction . if  @xmath37 is convex , then  @xmath64 is right / left differentiable which means that @xmath65 exist with the vectors @xmath66 having unit euclidean norm .",
    "note that , since the definition is for a fixed parametrization of the curve , we may and will regard  @xmath67 as functions of  @xmath68 .",
    "we say that a convex set @xmath3 has a _ corner _ at a point  @xmath69 if @xmath70    we then have :    [ prop-2.16 ] let  @xmath10 be a norm on  @xmath9 and let  @xmath22 be a ( convex ) minimizer of @xmath18 for the norm  @xmath10 . if  @xmath22 has a corner at a point  @xmath69 , then  @xmath10 and the vectors @xmath71 must obey @xmath72 on the other hand , if holds for two distinct unit vectors @xmath73 , then there is a point @xmath69 such that @xmath74 and  @xmath22 thus has a corner at  @xmath75 . in particular , @xmath43 is continuously differentiable if and only if  @xmath10 is strictly convex .    by the symmetries of the norm , if  @xmath22 is centered and has a corner at  @xmath75 with tangent vectors  @xmath76 , then it also has a corner at @xmath77 with tangent vectors @xmath78 .",
    "however , this does not imply that  @xmath22 is a parallelogram as that would require for all @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , there are norms for which  @xmath22 has corners and yet no facets at all .",
    "this is best seen from the fact that the above characterizations of facets and corners ( including the proofs thereof ) apply equally well to the isoperimetric problem .",
    "there we can enforce the desired features of the minimizing shape  @xmath80 from directly and then extract @xmath10 by the duality transformation @xmath81 .",
    "having introduced the problem and stated the main results , let us now discuss briefly the context of this work including the prior literature on the subject .",
    "we will then also outline the key ideas and give a list of remarks and directions for possible extensions .",
    "shape optimization for dirichlet eigenvalues of the laplacian has been a topic of considerable interest in recent years .",
    "early work focused on optimizing the eigenvalues under a constraint on the lebesgue volume . here the case of the principal eigenvalue goes back to faber and krahn s solution of the problem posed by lord rayleigh in his `` theory of sound . ''",
    "the case of higher eigenvalues has been resolved only in the last 10 - 15 years ; see , e.g. , the books by henrot  @xcite and velichkov  @xcite for details as well as some historical perspective .",
    "more recently , attempts have been made to find shapes optimizing dirichlet eigenvalues of the laplacian subject to other types of constraints than volume .",
    "in particular , this includes constraints on the perimeter .",
    "the relevant references are the papers of bucur and freitas  @xcite , bucur , butazzo and henrot  @xcite , van den berg and inversen  @xcite and de philippis and velichkov  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these works focus solely on the perimeter defined using the euclidean norm and , since this makes the case of the principal eigenvalue directly solvable , on higher - order eigenvalues .",
    "our interest in perimeters that are defined using non - isotropic norms arises from a study of a random walk on  @xmath82 that ( self-)interacts through the size of its boundary . as a result of the interaction ,",
    "the random walk gets squeezed to a subdiffusive spatial scale .",
    "berestycki and yadin  @xcite , who introduced this problem in the first place , identified the typical diameter of the support of the walk for large times . in  @xcite ,",
    "the present authors show that ( in the limit of large times and vanishing temperatures ) the asymptotic shape of the visited set is given by minimizing the functional for a suitably defined underlying norm  @xmath10 .",
    "this norm is model dependent , invariably non - isotropic ( due to persistent lattice structure ) and exhibiting degenerate directions as well as directions where strict convexity fails .",
    "hence our interest in the understanding of the resulting effects on the shape of the minimizer .",
    "let us now move to discuss some aspects of the proofs in the present paper .",
    "some of these are fairly straightforward ( e.g. , the existence and convexity of a minimizing set ) but others require novel and ( we think ) interesting ideas .",
    "one such case is the proof of uniqueness ( up to translates ) of the minimizing set which is based on a convexity argument with respect to the minkowski addition of sets : for @xmath32 and @xmath83 $ ] , let @xmath84 for convex  @xmath37 and  @xmath85 the principal eigenvalue turns out to be convex , @xmath86,\\ ] ] and , in fact , _ strictly _ so for @xmath87 unless the sets  @xmath37 and  @xmath85 are homothetic ( see  lemma  [ lemma-2.9 ] whose proof we extract from colesanti  @xcite ) .",
    "the perimeter is affine ( for convex  @xmath37 and  @xmath85 ) , @xmath88,\\ ] ] ( cf lemma  [ lem : parconv ] ) , and so this leads to a type of strict convexity for  @xmath18 that rules out simultaneous occurrence of two non - homothetic minimizers .",
    "the proof of uniqueness via the stated convexity argument is exactly what forces us to restrict attention to spatial dimension @xmath89 .",
    "indeed , the perimeter is no longer affine in  @xmath90 and , in fact , the inequality one finds in counterexamples ( see remark  [ rem - notaffine ] ) shows that  @xmath18 is not convex with respect to minkowski set addition in  @xmath90 .",
    "( in these dimensions , taking the convex hull does not necessarily decrease the perimeter and so even showing that the minimizer is convex constitutes a non - trivial problem ; cf bucur , buttazo and henrot  @xcite . )",
    "we remark that the results on higher - order eigenvalues ( for euclidean perimeter ) in the aforementioned references @xcite above do not seem to address uniqueness of a minimizing shape at all .",
    "unfortunately , our method does not appear to contribute in this context either .",
    "another aspect where our results are limited to @xmath89 is the control of the hausdorff distance to the minimizing set using the value of  @xmath23 . indeed , similarly to the isoperimetric problem",
    ", one can fairly easily find a sequence of sets in @xmath90 whose  @xmath23-value approaches the minimum and yet the sets stay a uniform hausdorff distance away from the class  @xmath47 of the minimizing sets .",
    "( here the @xmath10-perimeter of  @xmath91 for  @xmath90 is defined as @xmath92 where  @xmath93 is the normal vector to  @xmath4 at  @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the @xmath96-dimensional hausdorff measure on  @xmath4 . )",
    "a technical reason for the restriction to  @xmath89 is that our proof of theorem  [ thm-1 ] is conveniently based on a theorem of verk  @xcite that provides continuity of the principal eigenvalue under ( properly formulated ) hausdorff convergence , but only in @xmath89 .",
    "both the uniqueness of the minimizer and the control of the hausdorff distance to the minimizers by the value of the functional  @xmath23 are crucial for the application of the above results in the context of the above mentioned random walk problem  @xcite .",
    "the same applies to our characterization of facets / corners appearing on the minimizing shape .",
    "such features have been of large interest in probabilistic shape theorems ( e.g. , the recent review by auffinger , damron and hanson  @xcite of shape theorems in first passage percolation ) .",
    "we continue with five remarks .",
    "the first one addresses certain limitations that were built into the setting of the very problem :    recall that we look for minimizers only in the class of jordan domains , which are in particular simply connected , connected and with the boundary being the trace of a simple curve . here",
    "are some reasons why we chose this setting .",
    "simple connectedness is necessary for uniqueness : removing an isolated point or , in general , a small - enough polar set changes neither the principal eigenvalue nor the perimeter of the set .",
    "the restriction to connectedness is more or less an irreducibility statement : the principal eigenvalue of a set with more than one connected components is the minimum of the eigenvalues in the individual components .",
    "dropping all but the minimizing component decreases the perimeter . finally , the restriction to domains whose boundary is a simple curve is a matter of convenience ; particularly , in the definition of the perimeter using the classical arc - length formula  .",
    "the other two remarks are concerned with a direct characterization of the minimizing sets .",
    "[ rem1 ] in some special cases ( as noted above ) , the minimizer  @xmath22 can be characterized explicitly .",
    "for instance , if  @xmath10 is the euclidean norm , the faber - krahn and isoperimetric inequalities imply that , in the class of sets with a given lebesgue volume , both the eigenvalue and the perimeter are minimized by the euclidean ball . by some scaling arguments ,",
    "the same then applies to the sum thereof . for the @xmath30 , resp .",
    ", @xmath31 norm , the minimizer is an @xmath31 , resp .",
    ",  @xmath30 ball .",
    "this follows by the dual relation of these norms and the monotonicity of the eigenvalue in the underlying set .",
    "unfortunately , unlike for the isoperimetric problem   where the minimizing shape is simply a ball in the dual norm , for general norm  @xmath10 we do not seem to have a way to describe the minimizing set  @xmath22 directly . for smooth norms with smooth minimizing shape , variational calculus shows that the minimizing shape satisfies @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the normalized principal eigenfunction of the laplacian in  @xmath37 and  @xmath99 is the curvature of  @xmath43 at point  @xmath94 relative to the arc - length defined by the norm  @xmath10 ; see the proof of theorem  [ prop-1.2 ] in section  [ sec - last ] .",
    "this generally leads to an overdetermined elliptic problem that we do not see prospects of it being explicitly solvable except for one case : @xmath10 = euclidean norm .",
    "[ rem2 ] instead of relying on variational calculus , one might try to mimic the proof that the isoperimetric set for  @xmath10-perimeter is a dilation of the support set of the norm  @xmath10 .",
    "one is prompted to try this by the fact that the main tool of this proof , the brunn - minkowski inequality for the lebesgue volume , generalizes to the principal eigenvalue of the laplacian .",
    "indeed , colesanti  @xcite showed that for any bounded , open and convex @xmath100 , @xmath101 this leads to the following inequality for any bounded open and convex @xmath100 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the normal to @xmath4 at point  @xmath94 , @xmath104 and  @xmath105 is the @xmath96-dimensional hausdorff measure on  @xmath4 .",
    "the point where this approach currently runs into a dead end is the appearance of the eigenfunctions  @xmath106 and  @xmath98 , which seem to prevent us from interpreting the integral as a perimeter functional in .",
    "finally , we want to make the following notes on the qualitative nature of our conclusions :    our proof of theorem  [ prop-2.12 ] links degenerate directions to facets . however , the argument is not quantitive and so we do not know how the size of the facet depends on the size of @xmath107 .",
    "progress on this questions may be of interest .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ thm-1 ] goes through a limit argument and thus gives no specific relation between  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 .",
    "it would be interesting to derive a quantitative ( bonnesen - like ) inequality between @xmath110 and some function of @xmath111 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to the proof of the above results .",
    "the strategy is as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we first establish the existence of a convex minimizer and then use the aforementioned argument to show that the convex minimizer is unique up to spatial shifts .",
    "this proves theorem  [ thm-0 ] .",
    "we then also control the continuity in the underlying norm and rule out non - convex minimizers ( and thus prove theorem  [ thm-1 ] ) .    in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we address the criteria for existence / absence of facets ( proving theorem  [ prop-2.12 ] ) and relate appearance of corners to non - strict convexity of the norm ( proving theorem  [ prop-2.16 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we also give an explicit example of a norm for which the isoperimetric shape differs from the minimizer of  @xmath23 , and prove that these are generically different in the class of smooth norms with smooth minimizers ( proving theorem  [ prop-1.2 ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to begin the proofs of our main results . here",
    "we will show all needed facts underlying the proofs of theorem  [ thm-0 ] and  [ thm-1 ] .",
    "recall the notation  @xmath112 for the function in and  @xmath19 for the class of admissible domains in .",
    "the key point of this subsection is the observation that , as far as finding a minimizer is concerned , we can safely restrict attention to convex sets :    [ prop-2 ] let  @xmath10 be any norm on  @xmath9 .",
    "given  @xmath3 , let @xmath113 denote the convex hull of  @xmath37",
    ". then @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we begin with a lemma that gives _ a priori _ estimates on the volume and the perimeter of sets we need to consider .",
    "these will be used later in our proofs .",
    "[ lemma-2.1 ] let  @xmath10 be an arbitrary norm on  @xmath9",
    ". then @xmath116 and there are constants @xmath117 such that the infimum problem is not affected by restricting to sets satisfying @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes the perimeter of  @xmath37 in the euclidean norm on  @xmath9 .",
    "proof let @xmath120 , resp .",
    ", @xmath121 denote the minimal , resp . , maximal value of @xmath122 for  @xmath94 on the unit euclidean sphere in  @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath123 so it suffices to prove the lemma just for the euclidean norm . here the @xmath124-dimensional faber - krahn inequality states @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the value of @xmath15 for @xmath37 being a disc of unit lebesgue area , while the isoperimetric inequality yields @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the euclidean perimeter of a disc of the unit area .",
    "putting these bounds together , an upper bound on  @xmath112 thus yields both upper and lower bounds on  @xmath36 .",
    "the above then extend these to upper and lower bounds on  @xmath119 as well .",
    "the main step of the proof of proposition  [ prop-2 ] is that fact that ( in  @xmath89 ) , taking the convex hull does not increase the perimeter of the set . to prove this fact we have to show that every polygonal approximation of the boundary of the convex hull  @xmath129 of a set  @xmath3 can be reduced to a polygonal approximation of  @xmath4 of at least that much length .",
    "although this appears intuitively obvious , a formal proof requires some geometric details of how  @xmath37 is related to  @xmath129 . instead of bundling these with the actual argument , we make them the content of a separate lemma .",
    "[ lemma-2.3 ] let @xmath3 and let @xmath113 be the convex hull of  @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath113 is open and , in fact , @xmath130 in particular , @xmath113 is connected .",
