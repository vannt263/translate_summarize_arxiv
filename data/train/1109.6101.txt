    "we consider the two - way wireless relaying scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ relay_channel ] , where bi - directional data transfer takes place between the nodes a and b with the help of the relay r. it is assumed that all the three nodes operate in half - duplex mode , i.e. , they can not transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band .",
    "the relaying protocol consists of the following two phases : the _ multiple access _ ( ma ) phase , during which a and b simultaneously transmit to r and the _ broadcast _ ( bc ) phase during which r transmits to a and b. network coding is employed at r in such a way that a ( b ) can decode the message of b ( a ) , given that a ( b ) knows its own message .",
    "the concept of physical layer network coding has attracted a lot of attention in recent times .",
    "the idea of physical layer network coding for the two way relay channel was first introduced in @xcite , where the multiple access interference occurring at the relay was exploited so that the communication between the end nodes can be done using a two stage protocol .",
    "information theoretic studies for the physical layer network coding scenario were reported in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the design principles governing the choice of modulation schemes to be used at the nodes for uncoded transmission were studied in @xcite .",
    "an extension for the case when the nodes use convolutional codes was done in @xcite .",
    "a multi - level coding scheme for the two - way relaying scenario was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that for uncoded transmission , the network coding map used at the relay needs to be changed adaptively according to the channel fade coefficient , in order to minimize the impact of the multiple access interference .",
    "in other words , the set of all possible channel realizations is quantized into a finite number of regions , with a specific network coding map giving the best performance in a particular region . in @xcite , a quantization",
    "was obtained using computer search for 4-psk signal set . in this paper , we obtain such a quantization analytically for any @xmath0-psk signal set , where @xmath3 , for some positive integer @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the @xmath0-psk constellation used at a and b , where @xmath0 is of the form @xmath6 , @xmath4 being a positive integer .",
    "assume that a ( b ) wants to transmit an @xmath4-bit binary tuple to b ( a ) .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the mapping from bits to complex symbols used at a and b. let @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath10 denote the complex symbols transmitted by a and b respectively , where @xmath11 .",
    "the received signal at @xmath12 is given by ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the fading coefficients associated with the a - r and b - r links respectively .",
    "the additive noise @xmath16 is assumed to be @xmath17 , where @xmath17 denotes the circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath18 .",
    "we assume a block fading scenario , with the ratio @xmath19 denoted as @xmath20 referred to as the fading state , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "also , it is assumed that @xmath23 is distributed according to a continuous probability distribution .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the effective constellation at the relay during the ma phase , i.e. ,    @xmath25    let @xmath26 denote the minimum distance between the points in the constellation @xmath24 , i.e. ,    @xmath27    from , it is clear that there exists values of @xmath28 for which @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 .",
    "the elements of @xmath31 are said to be the singular fade states .",
    "a fade state @xmath28 is said to be a singular fade state , if the cardinality of the signal set @xmath32 is less than @xmath33 .",
    "for example , consider the case when symmetric 4-psk signal set used at the nodes a and b , i.e. , @xmath34 . for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , since ,    @xmath37    alternatively , when @xmath35 , the constellation @xmath24 has only 12 ( @xmath3816 ) points .",
    "hence @xmath35 is a singular fade state for the case when 4-psk signal set is used at a and b.    let @xmath39 denote the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimate of @xmath40 based on the received complex number @xmath41 , i.e. ,     @xmath42      depending on the value of @xmath28 , r chooses a map @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the signal set used by r during @xmath45 phase .",
    "the elements in @xmath46 which are mapped on to the same complex number in @xmath44 by the map @xmath47 are said to form a cluster .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the set of all such clusters .",
    "the formation of clusters is called clustering , denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the received signals at a and b during the bc phase are respectively given by ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the complex number transmitted by r. the fading coefficients corresponding to the r - a and r - b links are denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively and the additive noises @xmath54 and @xmath55 are @xmath56 ) .    in order to ensure that a ( b ) is able to decode b s ( a s ) message , the clustering @xmath49 should satisfy the exclusive law @xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath57    from an information theoretic perspective , the mapping @xmath47 needs to satisfy the exclusive law for the reason outlined below .",
    "consider the ideal situation where the additive noises at the nodes are zero .",
    "it is assumed that the fading state @xmath58 . the assumption is required since r can decode unambiguously to an element in @xmath46 only if @xmath28 is not a singular fade state and is justified",
    "since @xmath28 takes values from a continuous probability distribution and the cardinality of @xmath31 is finite . during the ma phase ,",
    "assume the relay jointly decodes correctly to the pair @xmath59 and transmits @xmath60 during the bc phase .",
    "the received complex symbols at a and b are respectively @xmath61 and @xmath62 . at node a , the amount of uncertainty about @xmath63 which gets resolved after observing @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( since @xmath63 and @xmath66 are independent ) . since @xmath67 if and only if the mapping @xmath47 satisfies the exclusive law , the amount of uncertainty about @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) which gets resolved at a ( b ) is maximized if and only if the clustering satisfies the exclusive law .",
    "the cluster distance between a pair of clusters @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the minimum among all the distances calculated between the points @xmath70 which satisfy the conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the _ minimum cluster distance _ of the clustering @xmath49 is the minimum among all the cluster distances , i.e. ,    @xmath73    the minimum cluster distance determines the performance during the ma phase of relaying .",
    "the performance during the bc phase is determined by the minimum distance of the signal set @xmath44 . throughout",
    ", we restrict ourselves to optimizing the performance during the ma phase . for values of @xmath28 close to the singular fade states , the value of @xmath26 is greatly reduced .",
    "hence for each singular fade state , a clustering needs to be chosen such that the minimum cluster distance at the singular fade state is non - zero and is also maximized .",
    "a clustering @xmath74 is said to remove a singular fade state @xmath75 , if the minimum cluster distance of the clustering @xmath74 for @xmath76 is greater than zero .",
    "let @xmath77 denote the set of all such clusterings",
    ". for examples of clusterings , see @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the clusterings were obtained using a computer search algorithm , whereas in @xcite , it is obtained analytically using the mathematical structure called latin square .",
    "let @xmath78 denote the minimum cluster distance of the clustering @xmath79 evaluated at @xmath80 . for @xmath58",
    ", the clustering @xmath49 is chosen to be @xmath79 , which satisfies @xmath81 .",
    "the clusterings which belong to the set @xmath82 need not be distinct , since a single clustering can remove more than one singular fade state .",
    "it is assumed that the channel state information is not available at the transmitting nodes a and b during the ma phase .",
    "a block fading scenario is assumed and the clustering used by the relay is indicated to a and b by using overhead bits .",
    "the procedure suggested in @xcite to obtain the set of all clusterings , was using a computer algorithm ( closest neighbour clustering algorithm ) , which involved varying the fade state values over the entire complex plane , i.e. , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and finding the clustering for each value of channel realization .",
    "the total number of network codes which would result is known only after the algorithm is run for all possible realizations @xmath28 which is uncountably infinite and hence the number of overhead bits required is not known beforehand . moreover , performing such an exhaustive search is extremely difficult in practice , especially when the cardinality of the signal set @xmath0 is large .",
    "the implementation complexity of the scheme suggested in @xcite is extremely high .",
    "it appears that , for each realization of the singular fade state , the closest neighbour clustering algorithm @xcite needs to be run at r to find the clustering .",
    "in contrast , we provide a simple criterion ( section iv a ) based on which a clustering from the set @xmath82 is chosen depending on the value of @xmath28 . in this way",
    ", the set of all values of @xmath80 ( the complex plane ) is quantized into different regions , with a clustering from the set @xmath82 used in a particular region .    in the closest neighbour clustering algorithm suggested in @xcite ,",
    "the network coding map is obtained by considering the entire distance profile .",
    "the disadvantages of such an approach are two - fold .    * considering the entire distance profile , instead of the minimum cluster distance alone which contributes dominantly to the error probability , results in an extremely large number of network coding maps .",
    "for example , for 8-psk signal set , the closest neighbour clustering algorithm results in more than 5000 maps . *",
    "the closest neighbour clustering algorithm tries to optimize the entire distance profile , even after clustering signal points which contribute the minimum distance . as a result , for several channel conditions , the number of clusters in the clustering obtained is greater than the number of clusters in the clustering obtained by taking the minimum distance alone into consideration .",
    "this results in a degradation in performance during the bc phase , since the relay uses a signal set with cardinality equal to the number of clusters .    in @xcite , to overcome the two problems mentioned above , another algorithm is proposed , in which for a given @xmath28 , an exhaustive search is performed among all the network coding maps obtained using the closest neighbour clustering algorithm and a map with minimum number of clusters is chosen .",
    "the difficulties associated with the implementation of the closest neighbour clustering algorithm carry over to the implementation of this algorithm as well .    to avoid all these problems we suggest a scheme , which is based on the removal of all the singular fade states . since the number of singular fade states is finite ( the exact number of singular fade states and their location in the complex plane",
    "are discussed in section ii ) , the total number of network coding maps used is upper bounded by the number of singular fade states .",
    "in fact , the total number of network coding maps required is shown to be lesser than the total number of singular fade states in section vi in @xcite .",
    "in other words , the total number of network coding maps required is known exactly , which determines the number of overhead bits required .",
    "it is shown in section iii in @xcite that the problem of obtaining clusterings which remove all the singular fade states reduces to completing a finite number of partially filled latin squares , which totally avoids the problem of performing exhaustive search for an uncountably infinite number of values .",
    "the contributions and organization of the paper are as follows :    * it is shown that the singular fade states lie on @xmath85 circles , with @xmath0 singular fade states lying on each circle , when @xmath0-psk signal set is used at a and b ( section ii ) .",
    "* it is shown analytically that the @xmath28 ( complex ) plane can be classified into two regions : a region called the singularity - free region containing no singular fade states in which any clustering satisfying the exclusive law gives the same minimum cluster distance and the other region called the singularity region in which the choice of the clustering impacts the minimum cluster distance ( section iii a ) .",
    "* for the case when @xmath0-psk signal set is used at a and b , the explicit boundaries of the singularity - free region are obtained ( section iii b ) . * a quantization of the singularity region for @xmath0-psk signal set",
    "is obtained analytically , with each one of the partitioned regions containing one singular fade state ( section iv a and iv b ) . * as an example of the channel quantization obtained analytically , the channel quantization for the case when the nodes a and b use 4-psk signal set is provided in section iv c. the channel quantization obtained is shown to be the same as the one which was obtained in @xcite using computer search .",
