    "multi - solitons in noncommutative euclidean two - dimensional sigma models are of interest as static d0-branes inside d2-branes with a constant b - field background  @xcite but also per se as nonperturbative classical field configurations . adding a temporal dimension , they represent static solutions not only of a ( wzw - extended ) sigma model but also of the yang - mills - higgs bps equations on noncommutative @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the full bps sector of the yang - mills - higgs system is , in a particular gauge , given by the ( time - dependent ) solutions to the sigma - model equations of motion .    in the commutative case ,",
    "the classical solutions of euclidean two - dimensional sigma models have been investigated intensively by physicists as well as by mathematicians ( for a review see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "prominent target spaces are u(@xmath0 ) group manifolds or their grassmannian cosets gr@xmath2 for @xmath3 ( which are geodesic submanifolds of u(@xmath0 ) ) . models . ]",
    "any classical solution  @xmath4 for the u(@xmath0 ) sigma model can be constructed iteratively , with at most @xmath5 so - called unitons as building blocks @xcite .",
    "the subset of hermitian solutions , @xmath6 , coincides with the space of grassmannian solutions , @xmath7 for some rank @xmath8 , of which again a subset is distinguished by a bps property .",
    "these bps configurations are precisely the one - uniton solutions and can be interpreted as ( static ) multi - solitons .",
    "let us now perturb such multi - solitons within the configuration space of the two - dimensional ( i.e.  static ) sigma - model , either within their grassmannian or , more widely , within the whole group manifold .",
    "a linear stability analysis then admits a two - fold interpretation .",
    "first , it is relevant for the semiclassical evaluation of the euclidean path integral , revealing potential _ quantum _ instabilities of the two - dimensional model .",
    "second , it yields the ( infinitesimal ) time evolution of fluctuations around the static multi - soliton in the time - extended three - dimensional theory , indicating _ classical _ instabilities if they are present .",
    "more concretely , any static perturbation of a classical configuration can be taken as ( part of the ) cauchy data for a classical time evolution , and any negative eigenvalue of the quadratic fluctuation operator will give rise to an exponential runaway behavior , at least within the linear response regime . furthermore",
    ", fluctuation zero modes are expected to belong to moduli perturbations of the classical configuration under consideration .",
    "the current knowledge on the effect of quantum fluctuations is summarized in @xcite .",
    "the moyal deformation of euclidean two - dimensional sigma models has been described in  @xcite , including the construction of their bps solutions .",
    "the operator formulation of the noncommutative u(@xmath0 ) theory turns it into a ( zero - dimensional ) matrix model with u(@xmath9 ) as its target space , where @xmath10 denotes a heisenberg algebra representation module .",
    "each bps configuration again belongs to some grassmannian , whose rank  @xmath11 can be finite or infinite .",
    "the latter case represents a smooth deformation of the known commutative multi - solitons , while the former situation realizes a noncommutative novelty , namely abelian multi - solitons ( they even occur for the u(1 ) model ) .",
    "although these solutions are available in explicit form , very little is known about their stability .",
    "our work sheds some light on this issue , in particular for the interesting abelian case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the noncommutative two - dimensional u(@xmath0 ) sigma - model and present nested classes of finite - energy solutions to its equation of motion .",
    "we focus on bps configurations ( multi - solitons ) and their moduli spaces , unifying the previously different descriptions of abelian and nonabelian multi - solitons .",
    "section  3 is devoted to a study of the fluctuations around generic multi - solitons and detects a universal unstable mode .",
    "section  4 analyzes the spectrum of the hessian specifically for u(1 )  backgrounds and settles the issue for diagonal bps solutions , analytically as well as numerically .",
    "section  5 addresses the fluctuation problem in the nonabelian case for the example of the noncommutative u(2 )  model .",
    "we close with a summary and a list of open questions .",
    "before addressing fluctuations , it is necessary to present the noncommutative two - dimensional sigma model and its multi - soliton solutions which we will set out to perturb later on .",
    "these solutions have been discussed as static solutions of a @xmath12 dimensional noncommutative sigma model @xcite which results from moyal deforming the wzw - modified integrable sigma model @xcite . here",
    "we review the results pertaining to the static situation .",
    "a moyal deformation of euclidean @xmath13 with coordinates @xmath14 is achieved by replacing the ordinary pointwise product of smooth functions on it with the noncommutative but associative moyal star product .",
    "the latter is characterized by a constant positive real parameter  @xmath15 which prominently appears in the star commutation relation between the coordinates , @xmath16_\\star \\= \\ic\\,\\th \\ .\\ ] ] for a concise treatment of the moyal star product see  @xcite .",

    "the star - product and operator formulations are tightly connected through the moyal - weyl map : coordinate derivatives correspond to commutators with coordinate operators , @xmath22 and the integral over the noncommutative plane reads @xmath23 where the function @xmath24 corresponds to the operator  @xmath25 via the moyal - weyl map and the trace is over the fock space  @xmath10 .",
    "we shall work with the operator formalism but refrain from introducing special notation indicating operators , so all objects are operator - valued if not said otherwise .",
    "the fields @xmath4 of the noncommutative two - dimensional u(@xmath0 ) sigma model are unitary @xmath26 matrices with operator - valued entries , i.e.  @xmath27 , and thus subject to the constraint @xmath28 the euclidean action of the model coincides with the energy functional of its @xmath12 dimensional extension evaluated on static configurations  @xcite , is the squared hilbert - schmidt norm of u(@xmath0)-valued operators on @xmath10 . we restrict ourselves to finite - energy configurations , i.e.  we demand that @xmath29 $ ] exists and is hilbert - schmidt .",

    "it follows that @xmath45 is orthogonal to @xmath567 . inserting @xmath568 into  ( [ ev ] )",
    ", we learn that the polynomial @xmath569 is proportional to @xmath570 .",
    "but then the first equality in  ( [ fsol2 ] ) demands that @xmath571 , constraining  @xmath541 . feeding this into the second expression for  @xmath45 in  ( [ fsol2 ] ) we see that the sum runs to @xmath572 only , implying that @xmath45 is orthogonal to @xmath573 as well .",
    "this finally simplifies the eigenvalue equation  ( [ ev ] ) to the one for @xmath574 , namely @xmath575 as required .",
    "hence , the non - negative part of the spectrum of  @xmath498 is purely continuous .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the hessian on  @xmath403 . in this case , the appropriate polynomials are the normalized ( generalized ) laguerre polynomials  @xmath576 , which form an orthonormal basis for @xmath577 .",
    "one rediscovers the @xmath11 proper eigenvalues as zeroes of the characteristic polynomial for @xmath578 , accompanied by a continuous spectrum covering the positive semiaxis for @xmath440 , as claimed earlier .",
    "if we do not care for resolving non - isolated eigenvalues , we may also infer the spectrum of the hessian  @xmath285 from the classical weyl theorem ( see  @xcite , theorem iv.5.35 and @xcite , ",
    "xiii.4 , example  3 ) .",
    "* assertion*. _ let @xmath579 be the diagonal _ bps    _ solution of rank  @xmath580 .",
    "then @xmath581)\\=\\{\\lambda_r\\}\\cup\\,[0,+\\infty)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath552 is a negative eigenvalue of multiplicity  @xmath582 and @xmath583 is the essential spectrum .",

    "weyl s theorem asserts that the essential spectrum is preserved under compact perturbations .",
    "the essential spectrum of @xmath55 ( on all subspaces  @xmath388 ) is known to be equal to @xmath583 .",
    "( this follows , for example , from the explicit diagonalization of @xmath585 in terms of the laguerre polynomials , as indicated above . )",
    "since the perturbation @xmath586 is finite - dimensional , weyl s theorem applies to show that the essential spectrum of  @xmath285 is also equal to @xmath583 .",
    "although we have explicitly shown that @xmath433 is positive semi - definite for  @xmath445 , the essential spectrum  @xmath441 can not exhaust the whole spectrum because the operator  @xmath498 is not positive semi - definite on @xmath393 .",
    "( indeed , ( [ qphi0 ] ) shows that the quadratic form  @xmath326 is negative on many finite vectors . )",
    "hence , @xmath498 must have negative eigenvalues of finite multiplicity .",
    "the above lemma implies that there can be only one such eigenvalue , and its multiplicity must be equal to  1 .",
    "this proves ( [ assert ] ) and the inequality @xmath587 .",
    "the estimate @xmath588 follows because the norm of the operator @xmath586 is equal to @xmath473 , so @xmath589 + 2r{\\mathbbm{1}}_{{\\mathcal h}}\\ge\\delta$ ] is non - negative definite and hence can not have negative eigenvalues .",
    "even though any non - diagonal bps background  @xmath4 can be reached from a diagonal one by a unitary transformation  @xmath81 which does not change the value of the energy , the fluctuation problem will get modified under such a transformation because @xmath590 will in general not have an action as simple as @xmath20 and @xmath34 in the original oscillator basis .",
    "the exceptions are the symmetry transformations , of which only the rigid translations @xmath54 and rotations @xmath52 keep @xmath4 within the grassmannian . to be specific , we recall that @xmath591 \\= e\\,[\\phi ] \\ , \\\\[4pt ]",

    "any solution is a translation of  @xmath593 , and hence our previous discussion of fluctuations around diagonal u(1 ) bps backgrounds completely covers that case .",
    "this is no longer true for higher - rank bps backgrounds . for a complete stability analysis of abelian @xmath11-solitons",
    "it is therefore necessary to investigate separately the spectrum of  @xmath285 around each soliton configuration ( [ pcoherentr ] ) based on @xmath11  coherent states , whose center of mass may be chosen to be the origin . since the background holomorphically depends on @xmath11 parameters  @xmath594 and passes to @xmath446 when all parameters go to zero , one may hope to show that the spectrum of  @xmath285 does not change qualitatively when @xmath4 varies inside the rank-@xmath11 moduli space .",
    "in this section we investigate the behavior of a simple u(2 ) bps solution under perturbations and conclude that the fluctuation analysis reduces to the u(1 ) case discussed in the previous section .",
    "we consider a nonabelian bps projector of the diagonal type considered in : @xmath595 clearly this describes a bps solution @xmath596                          \\phi^{(2,1 ) } & \\phi^{(2,2 ) } \\end{pmatrix }       \\= \\begin{pmatrix } - { \\mathbbm{1}}_{{\\mathcal h } } & 0\\\\[4pt ]                                 0        & { \\mathbbm{1}}_{{\\mathcal h}}-2p_q \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] of energy @xmath597 . inserting this into the expression ( [ qform ] ) for the quadratic energy correction  @xmath326 one obtains @xmath598 & \\= 2\\pi\\,\\tr\\bigl\\ { \\phi^\\+\\,\\delta\\phi\\ -\\ \\phi^\\+\\,(\\phi\\delta\\phi^\\+)\\;\\phi \\ } \\\\[4pt ] & \\= 2\\pi\\,\\tr\\bigl\\ { \\phi^\\+\\,\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)\\ , \\delta\\phi\\ -\\ \\phi^\\+\\,\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0&0\\\\0&1\\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)\\ , 2q \\bigl ( |q{-}1\\>\\<q{-}1| + |q\\>\\<q| \\bigr)\\,\\phi \\bigr\\ } \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the action of the hessian is obviously diagonal , we find that @xmath599 \\=   \\sum_{i , j=1}^2 e^{(2)}\\bigl[\\phi^{(i , i)},\\phi^{(i , j)}\\bigr ] \\ , \\ ] ] which reduces the fluctuation analysis to a collection of abelian cases . for the case at hand ,",
    "the hessian in the @xmath600 sectors is given by the laplacian and thus non - negative , while in each @xmath601 sector it is identical to the hessian for the abelian rank-@xmath72 diagonal bps case .",
    "hence , the relevant results of the previous section carry over completely .",
    "this mechanism extends to any diagonal u(2 ) background ( not necessarily bps ) , mapping the u(2 ) fluctuation spectrum to a collection of fluctuation spectra around corresponding diagonal u(1 ) configurations .",
    "the fluctuation problem around non - diagonal backgrounds , in contrast , is not easily reduced to an abelian one , except when the background is related to a diagonal one by a rigid symmetry , as defined in ( [ globalsym ] ) , ( [ globaltrans ] ) and ( [ globalrot ] ) .",
    "only a small part of the moduli , however , is generated by rigid symmetries , as our example of @xmath602 in ( [ umu ] ) demonstrates even for @xmath603 .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to extend these considerations to the general u(@xmath0 ) case .",
    "after developing a unified description of abelian and nonabelian multi - solitons in noncommutative euclidean two - dimensional sigma models with u(@xmath0 ) or grassmannian target space , we have analyzed the issue of their stability .",
    "thanks to the bps bound , multi - solitons in grassmannian sigma models are always stable . as in the commutative case ,",
    "their imbedding into a unitary sigma model renders them unstable however , as there always exists one negative eigenvalue of the hessian which triggers a decay to the vacuum configuration .",
    "our results are concrete and complete for abelian and nonabelian @xmath72-soliton configurations which are diagonal in the oscillator basis ( or related to such by global symmetry ) . for this case",
    ", we proved that the spectrum of the hessian consists of the essential spectrum @xmath604 and an eigenvalue @xmath605 of multiplicity one with @xmath606 .",
    "this assertion was confirmed numerically , and the value of @xmath605 was given as a zero of a particular function composed of monomials in  @xmath541 and the special function @xmath607 .",
    "furthermore , the complete set of zero modes of the hessian was identified .",
    "each abelian diagonal @xmath72-soliton background is characterized by a diagonal projector  @xmath70 of rank  @xmath72 , whose image and kernel trigger a decomposition of the space of fluctuations into three invariant subspaces , namely @xmath608 , @xmath609 and @xmath610 .",
    "in addition , every side diagonal together with its transpose is seperately invariant under the action of the hessian .",
    "this leads to a particular distribution of the admissible zero modes of the hessian , displayed here for the example of  @xmath611 : -5 mm        -5 mm where the double line denotes the single negative eigenvector , each solid diagonal segment represents a real normalizable zero mode , the dashed line depicts an admissible non - normalizable zero mode , and empty areas do not contain admissible zero modes .",
    "in addition , each side diagonal features a non - admissible zero mode at the edge of the continuous part @xmath604 of the spectrum .",
    "we plot the complete spectrum of the hessian at  @xmath611 ( cut off at size @xmath612 ) for each invariant subspace @xmath613 ( boxes ) , @xmath614 ( stars ) , @xmath615 ( crosses ) and @xmath393 ( circles ) , up to @xmath616 : -5 mm      since most soliton moduli are not associated with global symmetries , our explicit results for diagonal backgrounds do not obviously extend to generic ( non - diagonal ) backgrounds .",
    "we have not been able to compute the fluctuation spectrum across the entire soliton moduli space .",
    "the only exception is the abelian single - soliton solution which always is a translation of the diagonal configuration and therefore fully covered by our analysis .",
    "already for the case of two u(1 ) solitons , the unitary transformation which changes their distance in the noncommutative plane is only partially known .",
    "this leads us to a number of unsolved problems .",
    "the most pressing one seems to be the extension of our fluctuation analysis to non - diagonal backgrounds .",
    "next , following the even zero modes one can now find new non - bps solutions . also , it is worthwhile to investigate the commutative limit of the hessian and its spectrum .",
    "another interesting aspect is the existence of infinite - rank abelian projectors , i.e.  via an infinite array of coherent states , associated with bps solutions of infinite energy .",
    "furthermore , some technical questions concerning the admissible set of fields and their fluctuations have remained .",
    "finally , it would be rewarding to extend the geometrical understanding of sigma models to the noncommutative realm .",
