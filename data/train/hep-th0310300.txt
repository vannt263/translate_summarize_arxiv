    "as observed by t hooft @xcite , the standard model does not absolutely conserve baryon and lepton number due to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly .",
    "in particular t hooft considered spontaneous fermion number violation due to instanton transitions between topologically inequivalent vacua .",
    "manton @xcite considered the possibility of fermion number violation in the weak interactions from another point of view . showing the existence of non - contractible loops in configuration space , he predicted the existence of a static , unstable solution of the field equations , a sphaleron @xcite , representing the top of the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua . at finite temperature the energy barrier between distinct vacua can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations of the fields , and vacuum to vacuum transitions can occur , accompanied by a change of baryon and lepton number .",
    "the rate for baryon number violating processes is largely determined by a boltzmann factor , containing the height of the barrier at a given temperature , and thus by the energy of the sphaleron @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial topology of configuration space of weinberg - salam theory gives rise to further unstable classical solutions .",
    "a superposition of sphalerons , for instance , leads to static axially symmetric solutions , multisphalerons , whose energy density is torus - like @xcite .",
    "klinkhamer , on the other hand , has constructed a static axially symmetric solution , which may be thought of as a bound sphaleron - antisphaleron system , in which sphaleron and antisphaleron are located at an equilibrium distance on the symmetry axis @xcite",
    ". a conjectured generalization of these solutions @xcite are static axially symmetric sphaleron - antisphaleron chains @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we show , that weinberg - salam theory possesses a new type of unstable classical solutions : sphalerons , which have no rotational symmetry at all .",
    "the symmetries of these sphalerons are only discrete , and can be identified with the symmetries of platonic solids or crystals .",
    "we therefore refer to them as platonic sphalerons .",
    "classical solutions with platonic symmetries were first observed in the skyrme - model of baryons and nuclei , where these stable soliton solutions with higher baryon number are interpreted in terms of small nuclei @xcite .",
    "solitons with platonic symmetries are also known in the georgi - glashow model , where they represent monopoles with higher magnetic charge @xcite , and they arise as skyrmed monopoles in a modified georgi - glashow model with higher derivative terms @xcite .    monopoles with magnetic charge @xmath0 and skyrmions with baryon number @xmath0 are related to rational maps of degree @xmath0 @xcite . in particular certain rational maps of degree @xmath0 give rise to solitons with platonic symmetries @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the energy densities of the known classical solutions based on the same rational map but obtained in different physical models are qualitatively very similar .",
    "we here base our construction of sphaleron solutions of weinberg - salam theory on rational maps of degree @xmath0 as well .",
    "the rational maps then determine the behaviour of the higgs and gauge fields at infinity .",
    "we solve the general set of static equations of motion numerically , subject to the boundary conditions specified by the rational maps .",
    "we show , that the degree @xmath0 of the maps is related to the baryon number @xmath5 of the sphalerons : @xmath1 .    in particular ,",
    "we here consider sphalerons based on maps with degree @xmath6 . besides reproducing the axially symmetric sphalerons @xcite",
    ", we construct platonic sphalerons for @xmath7 , whose energy density has tetrahedral , cubic and octahedral symmetry , respectively .",
    "we compare the masses of the platonic sphalerons with those of the axially symmetric sphalerons , discuss the node structure of the modulus of the higgs fields for the platonic sphalerons , and compare with the node structure of the corresponding platonic monopoles .",
    "we obtain their magnetic moments perturbatively @xcite , because we construct the platonic sphalerons in the limit of vanishing weak mixing angle @xcite .",

    "it is inconsistent to set the u(1 ) field to zero , since the u(1 ) current @xmath37 acts as a source for the gauge potential @xmath38 .",
    "this current also determines the magnetic moment @xmath39 of a classical configuration , since @xmath40 when @xmath41 , the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath42 decouples and may consistently be set to zero .",
    "since we here construct sphaleron solutions in the limit of vanishing weinberg angle , we determine their magnetic moments only perturbatively @xcite .",
    "we note , that the ratio @xmath43 remains finite for @xmath44 .",
    "to obtain sphaleron solutions with discrete symmetry we make use of rational maps , i.e.  holomorphic functions from @xmath45 @xcite . treating each @xmath46 as a riemann sphere ,",
    "the first having coordinate @xmath47 , a rational map of degree @xmath0 is a function @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are polynomials of degree at most @xmath0 , where at least one of @xmath50 and @xmath51 must have degree precisely @xmath0 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 must have no common factors @xcite .",
    "we recall that via stereographic projection , the complex coordinate @xmath47 on a sphere can be identified with conventional polar coordinates by @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "subject to these boundary conditions , and the gauge condition @xmath62 we then solve the general set of field equations , involving 4 functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the higgs field and 9 functions @xmath65 for the gauge field , and @xmath66 .",

    "( [ q ] ) , after performing a gauge transformation with @xmath76 where @xmath77 tends to @xmath78 at infinity and vanishes at the origin .",
    "we note , that the non - gauge transformed chern - simons density @xmath79 vanishes identically for the spherically and axially symmetric sphalerons , due to the ansatz of the gauge potential @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for the platonic sphalerons the non - gauge transformed chern - simons density @xmath79 is non - trivial , and we checked numerically that it does not contribute to the baryon number for the platonic sphalerons .",
    "thus the only contribution arises from the gauge transformation @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ gtu ] ) .",
    "consequently , the platonic sphalerons have baryon number @xmath80",
    "to construct platonic sphalerons , we transform to dimensionless coordinates @xmath81 , and scale the gauge potential @xmath82 .",
    "the set of classical equations of motion is then solved numerically , subject to the boundary conditions specified by ( [ bchiggs])-([bca ] ) for the rational maps ( [ map1])-([map3 ] ) .",
    "we employ the gau - seidel algorithm on an equidistant mesh in the coordinates @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 defines the extend of the integration volume and @xmath86 defines the range @xmath87 $ ] of the coordinates @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",

    "turning to the numerical results , we first address the energy density of the platonic sphalerons . defining the energy density @xmath98 by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mass in units of @xmath101 , we present surfaces of constant energy density @xmath98 in figs .  1 for the platonic sphalerons based on the maps ( [ map1 ] ) , ( [ map2 ] ) , and ( [ map3 ] ) , for @xmath102 .",
    "the energy density of these sphalerons clearly exhibits tetrahedral , cubic and octahedral symmetry , respectively .",
    "since the energy density of a platonic sphaleron is qualitatively very similar to the energy density of a platonic monopole and a platonic skyrmion obtained from the same map @xcite , this indicates , that the shape of the energy density of a classical solution is determined primarily by the rational map , and rather independent of the model and the stability of the solution .    in table  1 we present the masses of these platonic sphalerons with @xmath7 in units of @xmath101 for two values of the higgs mass , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "also exhibited are the masses of the axially symmetric sphalerons @xcite with winding number @xmath104 , @xmath105 represents the spherically symmetric sphaleron @xcite . for the higgs masses considered ,",
    "the mass @xmath106 of the platonic sphalerons is slightly smaller than the mass of the corresponding axially symmetric sphalerons .",
    "( we note , that the mass difference is significantly larger than the numerical error for the masses . ) likewise , the mass of platonic skyrmions is smaller than the mass of the corresponding axially symmetric skyrmions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the mass of platonic skyrmed monopoles is slightly higher than the mass of the corresponding axially symmetric skyrmed monopoles @xcite . comparing the mass @xmath106 of the platonic sphalerons with @xmath0 times the mass @xmath107 of the spherically symmetric sphaleron",
    ", we observe , that for the higgs masses considered here , their ratio @xmath108 is close to one .",
    "( for axially symmetric sphalerons , the mass ratio @xmath108 is smaller than one for small higgs masses and larger than one for large higgs masses @xcite . )    we next address the modulus of the higgs field , and in particular , the location of its nodes .",
    "all sphalerons possess a node at the origin , which is the only node for the spherically symmetric sphaleron @xcite and the axially symmetric sphalerons @xcite .",
    "for the platonic sphalerons we expect a pattern of nodes , in accordance with the symmetries of the solutions .",
    "for the tetrahedral sphaleron ( @xmath2 ) , for instance , four ( @xmath109 ) additional nodes may be located along the four spatial diagonals , which pass through the maxima of the energy density .",
    "alternatively , four additional nodes could be located at the centers of the faces of the tetrahedron .    in figs .  2 we exhibit the components of the higgs field @xmath110 , @xmath111 , in units of @xmath112 along those spatial directions , where in accordance with the symmetries of the platonic sphalerons nodes of the modulus of the higgs field may be found .",
    "at a node of the modulus of the higgs field all components must vanish . as seen in figs .",
    "2a , b , the modulus of the higgs field of the tetrahedral sphaleron has indeed five nodes , four located on the diagonals close to the maxima of the energy density , and one located at the origin .",
    "one may thus be tempted to interpret the tetrahedral sphaleron as a superposition of four sphalerons ( @xmath105 ) located at the nodes along spatial diagonals and one antisphaleron ( @xmath113 ) located at the origin .",
    "the energy density at the origin is small however .",
    "similarly , we observe seven nodes for the modulus of the higgs field of the octahedral sphaleron ( @xmath4 ) , as seen in fig .  2c . in accordance with the symmetries ,",
    "one node is located at the origin , and six ( @xmath109 ) nodes are located symmetrically on the cartesian axes . again these six nodes are associated with the six maxima of the energy density , suggesting to interpret the octahedral sphaleron as a superposition of six sphalerons ( @xmath105 ) and one antisphaleron ( @xmath113 ) , although the energy density at the central node is small .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath114 nodes of the tetrahedral and octahedral sphalerons , we observe only a single node for the cubic sphaleron ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "there are no nodes along the spatial diagonals close to the eight ( @xmath115 ) maxima of the energy density , which would be required for an interpretation of the cubic sphaleron in terms of a superposition of sphalerons ( @xmath105 ) and antisphalerons , and there are no nodes along the cartesian axes as well .    comparing the node structure of the platonic sphalerons with the node structure of the platonic monopoles , we note , that they are completely analogous for the rational maps considered @xcite .",
    "associating for the monopoles a node of the higgs modulus with the location of a magnetic charge , an @xmath2 tetrahedral monopole , for instance , would then be composed of four monopoles and one antimonopole , and thus possess the proper total magnetic charge @xcite .    in table  1",
    "we also exhibit the magnetic moment @xmath116 in units of @xmath117 of the platonic and axially symmetric sphalerons @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moment is obtained perturbatively , since the sphaleron solutions are constructed in the limit of vanishing weak mixing angle .",
    "( for the axially symmetric sphalerons the deviation of the perturbative value of @xmath116 from the non - perturbative value @xcite is only 1% for @xmath118 and @xmath102 . ) the magnetic moment @xmath119 of the axially symmetric sphalerons increases strongly with @xmath0 , yielding a ratio @xmath120 on the order of one .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath119 of the corresponding platonic sphalerons is considerably smaller , yielding a ratio @xmath120 of only about one third for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , while the magnetic moment of the @xmath3 platonic sphaleron vanishes ( within numerical accuracy : @xmath121 ) .",
    "we have constructed sphalerons in weinberg - salam theory which possess only discrete symmetries .",
    "these sphalerons are based on rational maps of degree @xmath0 and have baryon number @xmath1 .",
    "the energy density of the platonic sphalerons constructed for @xmath7 possesses tetrahedral , cubic and octahedral symmetry .",
    "interestingly , the energy densities of platonic sphalerons are qualitatively very similar to the energy densities of platonic monopoles and platonic skyrmions , obtained from the same rational map @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude , that the shape of the energy density of a classical solution is determined primarily by the rational map , and rather independent of the model and the stability of the solution .",
    "the mass @xmath106 of the platonic sphalerons is lower than the mass of the corresponding axially symmetric sphalerons , for the higgs masses considered , and their mass ratio @xmath108 is close to one . for skyrmions , monopoles and skyrmed monopoles",
    "a second map with degree @xmath4 has been considered , leading to solutions with dihedral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the dihedral skyrmion and skyrmed monopole possess a slightly smaller mass than their octahedral counterparts @xcite .",
    "we expect a dihedral sphaleron ( @xmath4 ) in weinberg - salam theory as well , and also platonic sphalerons based on maps of higher degree @xmath122 .",
    "the node structure of the modulus of the higgs field of the platonic sphalerons and of the platonic monopoles is also completely analogous for the rational maps considered .",
    "the tetrahedral sphaleron has five nodes , four located on the diagonals close to the maxima of the energy density , and one located at the origin .",
    "similarly , the octahedral sphaleron has seven nodes , six located symmetrically on the cartesian axes close to the maxima of the energy density , and one located at the origin .",
    "the cubic sphaleron , in contrast , has a single node located at the origin .",
    "the perturbatively obtained magnetic moments of the platonic sphalerons do nt exhibit the ( almost ) linear growth with @xmath0 , observed for the axially symmetric sphalerons @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments of the tetrahedral and octahedral sphalerons are only about one third of the magnetic moments of the corresponding axially symmetric sphalerons , and the magnetic moment of the cubic sphaleron vanishes .",
    "the influence of a finite mixing angle on the magnetic moment and on the masses is expected to be small @xcite , and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the solutions constructed here possess an additional property , they satisfy @xmath123 , corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "thus only three of the four higgs field functions are non - trivial . without this symmetry property",
    "more general solutions may be found . in the case of spherical symmetry , for instance , additional unstable solutions , bisphalerons ,",
    "appear @xcite .",
    "their generalization to axial symmetry and platonic symmetries remains open .",
    "we conclude from our results , that the occurrence of localized finite energy solutions with platonic symmetries is a more general phenomenon than previously thought , since it appears to be present in various non - abelian field theories . in particular ,",
    "since the solutions constructed here are sphalerons , stability is clearly not needed for such solutions to exist .",
    "consequently , we expect the presence of platonic sphalerons in further theories , such as pure yang - mills theory coupled to gravity @xcite .",
