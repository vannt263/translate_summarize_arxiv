    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , discovered during the _ iras _ all - sky survey , radiate the bulk of their very large luminosities ( @xmath4 ) as dust emission in the infrared @xcite .",
    "hence , powerful energy sources , such as starbursts or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , must be present hidden behind dust . since distant ulirgs dominate the cosmic infrared background emission , the sum of the dust - obscured activity in the universe @xcite , establishing the energy sources of ulirgs is closely related to understanding the connections between obscured agns and starbursts .",
    "distant ulirgs are too faint to investigate in detail with existing facilities and so the study of nearby ulirgs continues to be an important means of understanding the distant ulirg population .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the majority of nearby ulirgs are energetically dominated by compact ( @xmath5500 pc ) , highly dust - obscured nuclear cores , rather than by extended ( @xmath2kpc ) , weakly obscured ( a@xmath6 @xmath5 15 mag ) starburst activity in host galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , a primary goal in the study of nearby ulirgs is to establish whether the obscured compact cores are very compact starbursts or agns .",
    "optical spectroscopy is an often used way to distinguish an agn from a starburst . in the presence of an agn obscured by dust in a torus geometry ,",
    "clouds that are photo - ionized by the radiation from the agn develop along the torus axis above a torus scale height ( the so - called narrow line regions : nlrs ) @xcite .",
    "the nlrs produce optical emission lines whose flux ratios differ from the clouds in starburst galaxies ; galaxies that contain an agn obscured by torus - shaped dust are classified optically as seyfert 2s @xcite .",
    "hence , this type of obscured agn can be identified by using optical spectroscopy . however , the nuclear regions of ulirgs contain sufficiently highly concentrated molecular gas and dust that putative agns may be obscured by dust in virtually all directions @xcite .",
    "such _ buried _ agns without significant nlrs are classified optically as `` non - seyferts '' , and so very difficult to find @xcite ; however , they are predicted to be abundant in the universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , the initial evidence of powerful buried agns has been detected in several optical non - seyfert ulirgs @xcite , so that it is essential to understand the contribution from buried agns to the total energy output of the ulirg population .",
    "one of the most effective ways to distinguish a buried agn from a very compact starbust as the primary energy source in the core of a ulirg is to investigate whether there is a strong x - ray - emitting source .",
    "a luminous buried agn should exhibit intrinsically strong x - ray emission at e @xmath2 2 kev from the vicinity of the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole @xcite , whereas in a starburst , the intrinsic x - ray emission above @xmath7 kev , relative to bolometric luminosity , is significantly weaker @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of intrinsically strong , but highly absorbed , x - ray emission can provide strong evidence for a powerful buried agn .",
    "although moderately x - ray absorbed , compton thin ( n@xmath8 @xmath5 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ) agns are easy to find with currently available x - ray data at e = 210 kev @xcite , it is very difficult to unveil and quantify the luminosities of compton thick ( n@xmath8 @xmath2 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ) buried agns using such data . given that most of the agns detected so far in optical seyfert-2 ulirgs @xcite and non - seyfert galaxies with l@xmath11 @xmath12 10@xmath13l@xmath14 @xcite suffer from compton - thick absorption , it is very likely that the majority of the putative buried agns in optical non - seyfert ulirgs are also compton thick .",
    "high - sensitivity observations at e @xmath2 10 kev using a next - generation x - ray satellite are required to properly evaluate the energetic importance of buried agns in a large ulirg sample .",
    "another approach to investigating whether a ulirg core has an intrinsically strong x - ray emitting source is to search for signatures of the effects of the luminous x - ray source on the surrounding interstellar medium . around a buried agn , x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ; maloney et al .",
    "1996 ) should develop , rather than the photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) usually found in starburst regions .",
    "xdrs and pdrs can be distinguished if they show different flux ratios of emission lines .",
    "in particular , emission lines in the far - infrared to millimeter wavelength range are potentially a powerful tool , because low dust extinction at these wavelengths makes it possible to uncover the signatures of xdrs around powerful buried agns that are usually deeply embedded in dust . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that the hcn ( j=10 ) ( @xmath15=3.38 mm ) , hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) ( @xmath15=3.36 mm ) , and co(j=10 ) ( @xmath15=2.60 mm ) lines are useful for this purpose , and argued that agn - dominated galaxies ( xdrs ) show systematically larger hcn / hco@xmath1 and hcn / co ratios in brightness temperature than starburst - dominated galaxies ( pdrs ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio is particularly effective for investigating the nature of heavily obscured ulirg cores for the following reasons : ( 1 ) since both molecular lines probe high - density molecular gas ( @xmath16 @xmath210@xmath17 @xmath18 ) , their relative ratios are not strongly contaminated by more extended lower density gas , whose relative fraction can vary among different galaxies , and ( 2 ) the wavelengths of the two lines are sufficiently close that they are observable simultaneously with wide - band receiving systems , reducing the net observing time and systematic errors . since hcn and hco@xmath1 are both moderately strong lines , this method is applicable to a larger number of galaxies than that proposed by @xcite , which uses various faint molecular lines for the purpose of distinguishing between xdrs and pdrs .",
    "interferometric maps are preferable to single - dish large - aperture observations for investigating the cores of ulirgs in the millimeter wavelength range , because they reduce the contamination from extended star - formation emission in the host galaxy .",
    "we applied this millimeter interferometric method to the infrared luminous galaxy ngc 4418 ( l@xmath11 @xmath3 10@xmath19l@xmath14 ) , which likely contains a powerful buried agn @xcite , and were successful in finding signatures of a buried agn from the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio @xcite , demonstrating the potential of this method . in this paper , we report the application of this interferometric hcn / hco@xmath1 method to three ulirgs : ugc 5101 , mrk 273 , and iras 17208@xmath00014 . throughout this paper , we adopt @xmath20 @xmath21 75 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 = 0.3 , and @xmath24 = 0.7 .",
    "the target ulirgs were selected based on the following criteria : 1 ) strong hcn emission is detected with single - dish radio telescopes , so that the study of hcn and hco@xmath1 emission - line ratios at the nuclei is feasible with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) , our observing facility .",
    "( 2 ) they are nearby ( @xmath25 0.06 ) , so that redshifted hcn and hco@xmath1 emission lines are observable with the nma receiving systems .",
    "the three ulirgs ugc 5101 , mrk 273 , and iras 17208@xmath00014 were selected as the first targets .",
    "table 1 summarizes the detailed information about these sources .",
    "an angular scale of 1@xmath26 corresponds to a physical size of 0.70.8 kpc for the three ulirgs .",
    "ugc 5101 ( z = 0.040 ) is included in the original ulirg sample @xcite and is a well - studied ulirg .",
    "it is classified optically as a liner @xcite or as a seyfert 2 in a slightly different classification scheme by a different group @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed infrared 34 @xmath27 m spectroscopy and detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission at 3.3 @xmath27 m , a starburst indicator , as well as signatures of a powerful agn deeply buried at the core .",
    "they inferred that the infrared luminosity of ugc 5101 is dominated by the buried agn , rather than the detected starburst activity .",
    "radio vlbi observations @xcite and a near - infrared high - spatial - resolution image @xcite showed compact , high surface - brightness emission , which was interpreted as an agn by these authors .",
    "similar compact emission was detected in the infrared at 12.5 @xmath27 m @xcite .",
    "the presence of a powerful obscured agn was confirmed by subsequent 210 kev x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected weak high - excitation forbidden emission lines originating in the nlrs in a mid - infrared 540 @xmath27 m high - resolution spectrum .",
    "judging from the detection of nlr - originating emission lines in the optical @xcite and mid - infrared @xcite , there may be a small angular range that is transparent to the agns ionizing photons ( mostly uv and soft x - rays ) .",
    "hcn ( j=10 ) data based on a single - dish telescope are available @xcite and indicate that if a significant fraction of the detected hcn emission comes from the nucleus of ugc 5101 , then an investigation of the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio at the core should be feasible using the nma with a reasonable integration time .",
    "mrk 273 ( z = 0.038 ) is also a well - studied ulirg @xcite .",
    "it is classified optically as a seyfert 2 @xcite .",
    "its seyfert-2 classification and the detection of strong nlr - originating high - excitation forbidden emission lines in the mid - infrared 511 @xmath27 m spectrum @xcite suggest that the dust distribution around the putative agn is torus - shaped and that a significant amount of ionizing radiation is escaping the agn .",
    "210 kev x - ray data have revealed the presence of a moderately absorbed compton - thin agn @xcite .",
    "the presence of an obscured agn in mrk 273 is also suggested from ( 1 ) a smaller equivalent width of 3.3 @xmath27 m pah emission than the typical value for starburst galaxies @xcite , ( 2 ) deep 9.7 @xmath27 m silicate dust absorption and weak pah emission features in the 813 @xmath27 m spectrum @xcite , and ( 3 ) compact high surface brightness mid - infrared emission at 12.5 @xmath27 m @xcite .",
    "the hcn flux from mrk 273 observed with a single - dish telescope is as strong as that from ugc 5101 @xcite , so that investigations of nuclear hcn and hco@xmath1 emission are also feasible for mrk 273 .",
    "iras 17208@xmath00014 ( z = 0.042 ) is classified optically as an hii - region @xcite . unlike other ulirgs ,",
    "the mid - infrared 823 @xmath27 m emission of iras 17208@xmath00014 is spatially extended , with no prominent core @xcite .",
    "its radio emission as detected with the vla is relatively compact @xcite , but its surface brightness is not high enough to indicate strongly the presence of an agn @xcite .",
    "its 813 @xmath27 m spectrum is typical of starburst galaxies , with prominent pah emission features @xcite its 34 @xmath27 m spectrum also displays a clear 3.3 @xmath27 m pah emission feature , but the detection of a moderately strong 3.1 @xmath27 m ice absorption feature suggests an energy source more centrally - concentrated than the surrounding dust , such as a buried agn @xcite .",
    "however , in iras 17208@xmath00014 , the agn signature is much weaker than ugc 5101 and mrk 273 .",
    "the detected hcn flux using a single - dish telescope is the largest among the three ulirgs @xcite .",
    "interferometric observations of hcn ( j=10 ) ( @xmath28 = 3.3848 mm or @xmath29 = 88.632 ghz ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) ( @xmath28 = 3.3637 mm or @xmath29 = 89.188 ghz ) were performed with the nma and rainbow interferometer at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) between december 2004 and march 2005 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the detailed observing log .",
    "the nma consists of six 10-m antennas , and observations were performed using the d ( the longest baseline was 82 m ) , c ( 163 m ) , and ab ( 351 m ) configurations .",
    "the rainbow interferometer is a seven - element combined array that includes six 10-m antennas ( nma ) and the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "the rainbow observations were performed when the nma array was in the ab configuration , and the longest baseline was 410 m. the sensitivity of rainbow is about twice that of the nma array in the 3-mm wavelength range , because the inclusion of the nro 45-m telescope increases the total aperture size by a factor of four .",
    "the backend was the ultra - wide - band correlator ( uwbc ) @xcite , which was configured to cover 1024 mhz with 128 channels at 8-mhz resolution .",
    "the central frequency was set to 85.49 , 85.67 , and 85.24 ghz for ugc 5101 , mrk 273 , and iras 17208@xmath00014 , respectively , so that both the redshifted hcn and hco@xmath1 lines were observable simultaneously .",
    "a bandwidth of 1024 mhz corresponds to @xmath33500 km s@xmath22 at @xmath30 @xmath3 86 ghz .",

    ". the hcn / co brightness - temperature ratio can increase if a galaxy contains a larger fraction of high - density molecular gas ( e.g. , solomon et al .",
    "1992 ; helfer & blitz 1993 ; kohno et al .",
    "1999 ; curran et al .",
    "in fact , ulirgs are expected to have a larger fraction of high - density molecular gas than less infrared - luminous galaxies do @xcite , so that hcn / co brightness - temperature ratios can be high in ulirgs , even without the hcn abundance enhancement caused by powerful agns .",
    "furthermore , the hcn and co data were taken on different observing runs , with different beam sizes , under different weather conditions , all of which could introduce additional systematic uncertainties . therefore , the interpretation of hcn / co brightness - temperature ratios in ulirgs is not simple .",
    "such uncertainties are much reduced if we use the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios .",
    "both hcn and hco@xmath1 ( @xmath27 @xmath34 debye ; botschwina et al .",
    "1993 ) probe high - density molecular gas ( @xmath16 @xmath2 10@xmath17 @xmath18 ) , so that the hcn / hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratio is insensitive to the different fraction of dense molecular gas , relative to diffuse one , in individual galaxies . furthermore , since both the hcn and hco@xmath1 emission lines were observed simultaneously with nma / rainbow for all the sources plotted in figure 8 , systematic errors are not a serious concern .",
    "for this reason , we use the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios ( ordinate ) in our discussion of the possible presence of powerful agns .",
    "our new millimeter interferometric data for ugc 5101 and mrk 273 reveal that the hcn / hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratios are high and in the range expected for agn - dominated galaxies ( hcn / hco@xmath1 @xmath42 2 ; kohno 2005 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that previous data have found the signatures of powerful agns in ugc 5101 and mrk 273 ( @xmath432 ) .",
    "the interpretation of our data for iras 17208@xmath00014 is rather unclear .",
    "no strong evidence for a luminous buried agn in iras 17208@xmath00014 has been found at other wavelengths ( @xmath432 ) .",
    "the hcn / hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratio for iras 17208@xmath00014 ( @xmath31.7 ) is located in between the expected values for agn- and starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "a powerful agn possibly hidden in iras 17208@xmath00014 may slightly increase the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio , but the presence of an agn is not clear from our data .      in ulirgs ,",
    "the profiles of hcn ( j=10 ) and co ( j=10 ) lines are generally similar ( solomon et al .",
    "1992 ; gao & solomon 2004 ; this paper ) , despite the difference of their optical depths .",
    "the similar line profiles are naturally explained by the widely accepted mist model @xcite , where a molecular gas cloud consists of a large number of small clumps , with a filling factor of @xmath51 at any fixed velocity . in this model ,",
    "even if each clump is optically thick for a molecular line , we can probe clumps at the background side of the molecular gas cloud .    if each clump is optically thin for a molecular line , its flux will increase linearly with increasing abundance .",
    "however , each clump is thought to be optically thick for co ( j=10 ) lines @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether each clump is optically thick or thin for hcn ( j=10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) lines , but we can roughly estimate their optical depths ( @xmath44 ) , based on the formula of @xmath45 where _ a _ is the einstein coefficient and is proportional to @xmath46 , where @xmath27 is the value of dipole moment @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the hcn and hco@xmath1 abundance , relative to co , are 10@xmath47 @xmath3 5@xmath3210@xmath48 @xcite , the optical depths of both hcn ( j=10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) lines are 0.22 times as large as that of co ( j=10 ) line .",
    "thus , this simple estimate suggests that each clump can be optically thick for hcn ( j=10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) lines .",
    "nguyen - q - rieu ( 1992 ) also showed that each clump can have optical depth slightly larger than unity for hcn ( j=10 ) line , if the volume filling factor of the clump is as small as f @xmath37 0.1 @xcite .",
    "for an optically thick case , although the relation between flux and abundance is not so simple , their positive correlation is still expected for the following main reason . assuming that each clump has a decreasing radial density profile ( @xmath39 r@xmath49 ; gierence et al .",
    "1992 ) , line emission comes mainly from the layer where an optical depth reaches unity @xcite .",
    "when a molecular abundance increases ( decreases ) , the @xmath44 = 1 layer for that molecular line moves outward ( inward ) .",
    "consequently , the surface area of the layer , or its area filling factor , becomes larger ( smaller ) , increasing ( decreasing ) the flux of that molecular line .",
    "unless the optical depth is extremely large , this effect can be significant and flux will increase with increasing abundance , if not completely linearly , as was demonstrated for the optically thick co ( j=10 ) line @xcite . hence , qualitatively , the high hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio in the brightness temperature can be explained by an enhanced hcn / hco@xmath1 abundance ratio in dense molecular gas from which the bulk of the observed hcn and hco@xmath1 fluxes originate .",
    "theoretical models allow the calculation of the abundance of molecules , including hcn and hco@xmath1 , as a function of distance from a central uv illuminating source or x - ray emitting agn deeply buried in molecular gas and dust @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the abundance of hcn can be enhanced relative to hco@xmath1 if a strong x - ray source is present inside molecular gas .",
    "@xcite calculated the effects of a central x - ray - illuminating agn on the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "they found that the hcn / hco@xmath1 abundance ratio in uniformly - distributed dense molecular gas ( 10@xmath50 @xmath18 ) , as probed by hcn and hco@xmath1 , around a luminous x - ray - emitting source can be substantially higher than the ratio in dense molecular gas illuminated only by a central uv source ( their fig.10 , model 4 ) .",
    "thus , we have some theoretical basis for the enhanced hcn abundance , relative to hco@xmath1 , in the presence of an x - ray - emitting agn .",
    "however , further sophisticated model calculations are definitely required to _ quantitatively _ interpret our observational results .",
    "models available to date @xcite have only calculated the hcn / hco@xmath1 abundance ratio and showed that the abundance ratio is a function of distance from the central illuminating source . to convert from the hcn / hco@xmath1 abundance ratio to brightness - temperature ratio , we have to know the region from where the bulk of the observed hcn and hco@xmath1 fluxes come , which has not been explicitly mentioned in any available model calculations .",
    "furthermore , the models assume uniform dust / gas distribution for simplicity .",
    "if the distribution is clumpy , which is more realistic @xcite , the abundance ratio can change substantially .    in order for our millimeter interferometric hcn / hco@xmath1 method to help to detect buried agn signatures , high - density molecular gas must be concentrated near the core region where putative agns reside and can affect the gas . if high - density molecular gas is distributed in between double nuclei , for example as in ngc 6240 @xcite , then our method may no longer work .",
    "furthermore , shocks may enhance hco@xmath1 emission @xcite .",
    "if shocks driven by outflows or superwind from starbursts coexist with powerful buried agns , and if there is a large amount of high - density molecular gas that is affected by the shocks , then the hcn / hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratio may decrease compared to that of a pure buried agn .",
    "thus , some fraction of the galaxies containing powerful agns can show low hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios and may be missed when searching based on the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio .    despite these remained ambiguities",
    ", this millimeter interferometric method can empirically be an effective means of revealing the presence of deeply buried agns at ulirg cores , because of the negligible dust extinction in this wavelength range .",
    "if this method is established from a larger number of sources , future observations with high spatial resolution and high sensitivity using alma are potentially a powerful probe for optically and even 210 kev x - ray - elusive buried agns in ulirg cores .",
    "we performed millimeter interferometric observations of the hcn ( j=10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) lines of the three ultraluminous infrared galaxies , ugc 5101 , mrk 273 , and iras 17208@xmath00014 , using nma / rainbow .",
    "these are the first interferometric maps of a ulirg sample for which the hcn ( j = 10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j = 10 ) molecular lines were observed simultaneously .",
    "we extracted the hcn to hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratios at the cores of these ulirgs , and compared the ratios with those previously estimated for less - luminous , agn - dominated and starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "we then looked for possible signatures of the influence of agns , strong x - ray emitters , on the surrounding interstellar medium at the nuclei .",
    "we found that :    1 .",
    "continuum and hcn emission were clearly detected in all ulirgs .",
    "hco@xmath1 emission was found in ugc 5101 and iras 17208@xmath00014 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emission , when detected , is coincident with the nuclear positions of these ulirgs .",
    "2 .   ugc 5101 and mrk 273 showed high hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios in brightness temperature , as found in agn - dominated galaxies .",
    "previous observations had suggested luminous obscured agns in ugc 5101 and mrk 273 , and so our millimeter interferometric data may be revealing the signatures of the effects of a luminous x - ray - emitting agn on the surrounding interstellar medium at the nucleus .",
    "3 .   the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio for iras 17208@xmath00014 was in between the regions occupied by agn- and starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "there was no clear evidence for a hidden agn in iras 17208@xmath00014 based on previously obtained data at other wavelengths .",
    "the presence of a luminous buried agn in iras 17208@xmath00014 remains uncertain based on currently available millimeter interferometric data .",
    "4 .   although the sample size is still small , this millimeter interferometric hcn / hco@xmath1 method succeeded in confirming agn signatures in the two ulirgs ( ugc 5101 and mrk 273 ) that were previously known to possess luminous obscured agns . since dust extinction is negligible at this wavelength range , we argue that our method is potentially an important tool for unveiling powerful , but deeply buried , agns in optical `` non - seyfert '' ulirgs in the alma era .",

    "<S> we present interferometric observations of three ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; ugc 5101 , mrk 273 , and iras 17208@xmath00014 ) in the 3-mm wavelength range , using the nobeyama millimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> both the hcn ( j=10 ) and hco@xmath1 ( j=10 ) molecular lines were observed simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> hcn emission was clearly detected at the nuclear positions of these ulirgs , and hco@xmath1 emission was detected at the nuclear positions of ugc 5101 and iras 17208@xmath00014 . </S>",
    "<S> the hcn to hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratios toward the nuclei of the three ulirgs were derived and compared with those of lower luminosity galaxies known to be dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or starbursts . in ugc 5101 and </S>",
    "<S> mrk 273 , where there is evidence for obscured agns from previous observations at other wavelengths , we found high hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios ( @xmath21.8 ) that are in the range found for agn - dominated galaxies . in iras 17208@xmath00014 , where the presence of a powerful obscured agn has been unclear </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio ( @xmath31.7 ) is in between the observed values for starburst- and agn - dominated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the high hcn / hco@xmath1 brightness - temperature ratios in ugc 5101 and mrk 273 could be the consequence of an hcn abundance enhancement , which is expected from chemical effects of the central x - ray emitting agn on the surrounding dense molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed millimeter interferometric method based on hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios may be an effective tool for unveiling elusive buried agns at the cores of ulirgs , especially because of the negligible dust extinction at these wavelengths . </S>"
