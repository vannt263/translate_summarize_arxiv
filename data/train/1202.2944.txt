    "point - to - point communication has revealed many of its secrets . driven by new applications , research in wireless communication is now focusing more on the optimization of communication in wireless _",
    "networks_. for example , the joint operation of multiple network layers can be optimized , denoted as cross - layer design @xcite , thereby leaving the classical layered architectures , such as the seven - layer open systems interconnect ( osi ) model @xcite .",
    "another example of network optimization is cooperative communication , where multiple nodes in the network cooperate to improve their error performance .",
    "cooperation may occur in many forms at different layers , e.g. cooperative channel coding at the physical layer and network coding at the network layer .",
    "network coding refers to the case where the intermediate nodes in the network are allowed to perform encoding operations over multiple received streams from different sources . in a standard layered construction , the decoding of the network code",
    "is performed at the network layer , after the point - to - point transmissions have been decoded at the physical layer .",
    "channel coding refers to the case where nodes perform coding over _",
    "one _ point - to - point wireless link only .",
    "cooperative channel coding is achieved by letting one or more relays transmit redundant bits for _ one _ source at a time .",
    "usually , channel coding and network coding are studied separately ( e.g. @xcite for cooperative channel coding and @xcite for network coding ) .    _ joint network - channel coding _ ( jncc ) received much of attention in the last years .",
    "this technique combines both decode and forward @xcite ( cooperative communication ) and cross - layer design by using a network code , which is accessible at the physical layer .",
    "the rationale behind joint network - channel coding is to improve the performance , by combining , at the physical layer , the channel codes and the network code as an overall error - correcting code @xcite .",
    "mostly , the two most important performance metrics are @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is",
    "the spectral efficiency and @xmath2 is the error rate ( bit error rate or word error rate ) . here , we consider a fixed spectral efficiency @xmath1 , so that the aim is to minimize @xmath2 for a given channel quality , expressed by @xmath3 , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . expressing the asymptotic ( for large @xmath3 ) error rate as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined as the _ coding gain _ and the _ diversity order _ , respectively , improving the performance refers to maximizing first @xmath6 and then @xmath5 ( because @xmath6 has the larger impact ) .",
    "standard linear network coding consists of taking _ linear combinations _ of several source packets , well known as the typical xor operations for binary codes . in general ,",
    "non - binary coefficients are used in the linear combinations . however ,",
    "when the network code is used at the physical layer to decode the noisy channel output , this simple technique might yield poor error performance .",
    "therefore , powerful network codes consisting of taking _ linear transformations _ of the incoming information packets , have been introduced .",
    "we denote this methodology as generalized linear network coding ( glnc ) .",
    "the well known standard linear network codes , taking _ linear combinations _ , are a special case of glnc . combining glnc with channel coding ,",
    "is denoted as joint network - channel coding ( jncc ) .",
    "the jncc , which is the overall code comprising the channel codes and the network code , can for example be an ldpc code or a turbo code .",
    "of course , while jncc brings more degrees of freedom and opens perspectives for a higher coding gain @xmath5 , it must be verified that important metrics , such as the diversity order @xmath6 and the scalability to large networks , are not negatively affected .",
    "binary jncc has already been studied in the literature .",
    "pioneering papers @xcite designed turbo codes and ldpc codes , respectively , for the multiple access relay channel ( marc ) and for the two - way relay channel @xcite",
    ". however , the code design was not immediately scalable to general large networks and did not contain the required structure to achieve full diversity . in @xcite , a full - diversity jncc for the marc",
    "was proposed but it was not extended to large networks .",
    "the work of hausl et al .",
    "@xcite was followed by the interesting work of bao et al .",
    "@xcite , presenting a jncc that is scalable to large networks .",
    "however , this jncc was not structured to achieve full diversity and has weak points from a coding point of view @xcite .",
    "a deficiency in the literature , for general networks with sources and relays , is the lack of a detailed diversity analysis in the case that the sources can act as a relay ( which is for example the model assumed by @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the parameters of the jncc on the diversity order is in general not known , because it is very hard to prove general statements on the diversity order , in an environment with so many degrees of freedom . this paper is a modest attempt to contribute to the solution of this problem . related to this",
    ", we mention @xcite , where the authors designed a jncc for the case where the sources can not act as a relay , but other nodes play the role of relay to communicate to one destination .",
    "as the source nodes are excluded to act as a relay node in this model , the diversity analysis in @xcite is different from ours .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a jncc where the network code forms an integral part of the overall error - correcting code , that is used at the destination to decode the information from the sources .",
    "the body of this paper consists of two main parts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diversity analysis of jncc ] , we perform a diversity analysis , leading to an upper bound on the diversity order of any linear binary jncc following our system model , and to a lower bound on the diversity order for a particular subset of linear binary jnccs .",
    "the upper and lower bound depend on the parameters of the jncc and can be used to verify whether a particular jncc has the potential to achieve full diversity on a certain network .",
    "secondly , in sec . [",
    "sec : practical jncc for n_u_r=2 ] , a specific jncc of the ldpc - type is proposed that achieves full diversity for a well identified set of wireless networks .",
    "the scalability of this specific jncc to large networks is discussed .",
    "the coding gain @xmath5 is not considered in the body of the paper and the parameters of our proposed code may be further optimized by applying techniques such as in @xcite , to maximize @xmath5 . to assess the performance of the proposed jncc",
    ", we determine the outage probability , a well known lower bound of the word error rate , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lower bound on the wer ] .",
    "we also present a tighter word error rate lower bound in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation of tight lower bound on wer ] , that takes into account the particular structure of the jncc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical results ] , the numerical results corroborate the established theory .",
    "we also briefly comment on the coding gain achieved by the proposed jncc and conclusions are drawn for different classes of large networks .",
    "this paper extends the work , published in @xcite , by also considering non - perfect source - relay channels , by considerably extending the diversity analysis , by providing an achievability proof for the diversity order of the proposed jncc , by clearly indicating the set of wireless networks where the proposed jncc is diversity - optimal , by providing a tighter lower bound on the word error rate , and by providing more numerical results .",
    "we first illustrate joint network - channel coding by means of a simple example .",
    "consider two sources orthogonally broadcasting a vector of symbols , mapped from the binary vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , to a relay and a destination .",
    "this channel is denoted as a multiple access relay channel ( marc ) in the literature .",
    "supposing that the relay is able to decode the received symbols , the relay computes a binary vector @xmath9 , which is mapped to symbols and transmitted to the destination .",
    "the relation between all bits is expressed by the jncc , whose parity - check matrix has the following general form , @xmath10 } \\normalsize .\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath11 represents the parity - check matrix for the point - to - point channel code .",
    "each of the binary vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , can be separately decoded using this code . the bottom part of @xmath12 represents the glnc , which we denote as @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "it expresses the relation between @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "more specifically , we have @xmath14 note that glnc includes standard network codes used in an osi communication model as a special case . in the latter case , the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( considering more than one relay in general ) are identity matrices or all - zero matrices , so that the network code simplifies to the relay packet being a linear combination of source packets , also expressed as xoring of packets or symbol - wise addition of packets .    ideally , the overall matrix @xmath12 conforms optimized degree distributions that specify the ldpc code . when the channels between sources and relay are perfect , we can drop the first 3 sets of rows and only keep the glnc , represented by @xmath17 ; in this case the information bits of the code are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 contains the parity bits .",
    "this is still a jncc as the redundancy in the network code is used to decode the received symbols on the physical layer at the destination . in @xcite , it is proved that the matrices @xmath11 do no affect the diversity order in the case of the marc .",
    "we consider wireless networks with @xmath18 sources directly communicating to a common destination ( e.g. cellphones communicating to a base station ) .",
    "two time - orthogonal phases are distinguished . in the _ source phase",
    "_ , the sources orthogonally broadcast their respective source packet . in the following _ relay phase _ , the relays orthogonally broadcast their respective packet .",
    "all considered sources overhear each other during the source phase , and act as relay in the relay phase .",
    "other nodes , not acting as a source , might be present in the network ( i.e. , overhearing the sources ) and also act as relay . hence , we consider a total of @xmath19 relays , where @xmath20 . this general network model , which is practically relevant as it fits many applications , is adopted in e.g. @xcite .",
    "take for example any large network and consider a volume in space ( cfr . picocells or femtocells ) where all nodes can overhear each other .",
    "these nodes form _ sub - networks _ and can be modelled by our proposed model . note that in the literature",
    ", sometimes other models are assumed , such as the @xmath21 model @xcite , where @xmath22 sources are helped by @xmath23 relays ( the relays are nodes different from the sources ) to communicate to one destination .",
    "all devices have one antenna , are half - duplex and transmit orthogonally using bpsk modulation .",
    "the @xmath24 information bits of each source are encoded via _ point - to - point channel codes _ into a systematic codeword , denoted as _ source codeword _ , of length @xmath25 , expressed by the column vector @xmath26 for user @xmath27 , @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the parity - check matrix of dimension @xmath29 of this point - to - point codeword is denoted by @xmath30 , which is the same for each user @xmath27 , so that @xmath31 for all @xmath27 . in the relay phase",
    ", each relay @xmath32 , @xmath33 $ ] , transmits a point - to - point codeword @xmath34 of length @xmath25 to the destination , also satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "hence , all slots have equal duration , the coding rate of the point - to - point channels is @xmath36 , and the overall coding rate is @xmath37 .",
    "we define the fraction of source transmissions in the total number of transmissions as the network coding rate @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 .",

    "all relevant channels between different to @xmath44 is the same as the channel from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . ]",
    "pairs of network nodes are assumed independent , memoryless , with real additive white gaussian noise and multiplicative real fading ( rayleigh distributed with expected squared value equal to one ) . the fading coefficient of a wireless link is only known at the receiver side of that link .",
    "we consider a slow fading environment with a finite coherence time that is longer than the duration of the source phase _ and _ the relay phase , so that the fading gain between two network nodes takes the same value during both phases .",
    "we denote the fading gain from node @xmath46 to the destination as @xmath47 , with @xmath48=1 $ ] .",
    "all point - to - point channels have the same average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "differences in average snr between the channels would not alter the diversity analysis , on the condition that the large snr behaviour inherent to a diversity analysis refers to all snrs being large . denoting the received symbol vector at the destination in timeslot @xmath49 as @xmath50 ,",
    "the channel equation is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the noise vector in timeslot @xmath49 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( bpsk modulation ) .",
    "hence , at the destination , each of the @xmath18 independent fading gains between the sources and the destination affects @xmath55 bits ( @xmath25 bits in the source phase and @xmath25 bits in the relay phase ) and each of @xmath56 fading gains between the non - source relays and the destination affects @xmath25 bits , assuming that all @xmath19 relays could decode the messages received from the sources .",
    "hence , from the point of view of the destination , the overall codeword is transmitted on a block fading ( bf ) channel with @xmath19 blocks , each affected by its own fading gain , where @xmath18 blocks have length @xmath57 and @xmath56 blocks have length @xmath25 .",
    "this notion will be essential in the subsequent diversity analysis ( sec .",

    "hence , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
