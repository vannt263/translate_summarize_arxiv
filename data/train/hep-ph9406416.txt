    "recent work on extended technicolor ( etc ) model building @xcite has demonstrated that technicolor ( tc ) theories could survive the challenges posed by precision electroweak measurements , the fermion mass spectrum , and limits on flavor - changing neutral currents and various rare decay modes . however , cp violation in technicolor theories remains a puzzling problem despite much study beginning more than ten years ago @xcite . in this paper",
    "we reexamine this problem in a generic etc model , with attention focused on the cp - odd @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomalous interactions and their induced effects .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking sector in technicolor theories can be most conveniently parameterized below the breakdown scale of chiral perturbation theory @xmath7 by a gauged nonlinear chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath7 is approximately given by @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 gev is the goldstone boson decay constant , and where @xmath10 is the number of technifermion flavors ( @xmath11 is the number of technifermion weak doublets ) .",
    "restricting attention to the minimal @xmath12 chiral symmetry of the technifermions and imposing electroweak gauge invariance , thirteen cp - conserving and three cp - violating operators up to dimension - four can be written down after using the classical equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the electroweak @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters @xcite , and the cp - even and cp - odd @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings @xcite , can all be conveniently described by these operators of the electroweak chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "when extended to a larger global symmetry ( as in the one family tc model to be used in this paper ) , there will be pseudo - goldstone - bosons ( pgbs ) appearing as effective degrees of freedom of the electroweak chiral lagrangian , and more operators can be written down beyond those for the minimal @xmath12 chiral symmetry .",
    "these additional operators will not , however , generate any new interactions at tree level among the electroweak gauge bosons , beyond those already existing in the gauged @xmath12 chiral lagrangian . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the anomalous interactions among the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , we will study the effects of cp - violating , etc interactions on the triple - gauge - boson vertices ( tgv s ) measured below @xmath7 . as the strength of the vertices involving pgbs",
    "is expected to be the same as those involving only electroweak gauge bosons , the contribution of the pgbs to the cp - odd tgvs will be suppressed by at least @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the fine structure constant ) relative to the direct contribution from the cp - violating etc interactions .",
    "we will therefore ignore the pgbs in this paper , and will restrict attention to the gauged @xmath12 electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "the size of the cp - violating dimension - four operators of the chiral lagrangian depends on the details of the high energy etc sector , and simple dimensional estimates may not be trustworthy .",
    "besides the suppression factor @xmath18 coming naturally from the etc sector ( @xmath19 denotes the relevant etc scale ) , a specific model may introduce a small dimensionless parameter into the final results if , for example , cp conservation is only slightly violated in extended technicolor interactions . at energies above @xmath7 but below @xmath19 , cp violation can be described effectively by a set of etc - induced , cp - violating four - fermion operators .",
    "these operators are added to the usual technicolor lagrangian along with corresponding cp - conserving four - fermion operators .",
    "the technicolor interaction itself respects cp symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the effect of these cp - violating four - fermion operators on the cp - odd tgvs , and on further amplitudes induced by the cp - odd tgvs . in the minimal standard model , the cp - odd tgvs",
    "are expected to arise via the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) mechanism @xcite at the three - loop level @xcite , and thus are suppressed by at least two powers of the weak coupling @xmath16 and by the small mixing effect among the three families of quarks .",
    "they are thus much too tiny to have experimental signatures in the near future . in technicolor theories , however , assuming maximal cp violation in the etc sector , our estimates show that these cp - violating tgvs are much larger than in the minimal standard model , and are comparable to or larger than in other extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "still they seem unlikely to show up directly in the next generation of high energy collider experiments .",
    "it is the indirect low energy effects induced by these cp - odd tgvs , especially the electric - dipole - moment ( edm ) of the neutron @xcite , that will be more accessible to future experiments .",
    "we thus include in this paper estimates of the induced edms of the neutron ( and electron ) in technicolor theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we write down the cp - odd tgv s , and the cp - violating dimension - four chiral lagrangian operators , along with a table of the c , p and cp transformation properties of all chiral lagrangian operators up to dimension four .",
    "the connection between the cp - odd tgv s and the cp - violating chiral lagrangian operators is made . in section  3",
    ", we compute the contribution to the cp - odd tgv form factors from a class of cp - violating four - fermion operators induced by single etc boson exchange .",
    "the future high energy experimental detectability of these tgvs is then discussed .",
    "the zero momentum limit of the tgvs is studied in connection with the cp - violating electroweak chiral lagrangian operators and the @xmath2 boson edm . in section  4 ,",
    "the edms of the electron and neutron , induced by the p- and cp - odd @xmath0 effective interaction , are computed and compared to current experimental limits .",
    "some other contributions to the edms of the neutron and the electron are found to be less important .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  5 .",

    "it will be neglected in this paper .",
    "the @xmath57 term vanishes as a consequence of electromagnetic gauge invariance .",

    "the fourteen dimension - four chiral lagrangian operators are suppressed by a factor of @xmath33 relative to the dimension - two operators .",
    "the coefficients of these dimension - four operators are then naturally of order @xmath67 times factors arising from weak - isospin breaking and cp violation(for the cp - violating operators ) .    the three independent , cp - violating , dimension - four operators of the electroweak chiral lagrangian were designated @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 in ref .",

    "the operators @xmath63 and @xmath66 have dimension two , and the operators @xmath94 through @xmath70 have dimension four .",
    "all these operators have been listed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    .05 in note that the sixteen chiral lagrangian operators in general do not have simple transformation properties separately under c and p , though they can be classified as cp - even and cp - odd under the combined cp operation .",
    "in unitary gauge , however , they can all be classified as c(p)-even or c(p)-odd , as shown in table  1 .",
    "it can be seen from the table that in unitary gauge , both @xmath91 and @xmath68 have unique transformation properties under c , p and cp .",
    "thus , these two operators might be isolated and probed experimentally , if proper observables are chosen and their size is large enough . have been studied in ref .  @xcite . ]    in unitary gauge , the cp - even chiral lagrangian operators reduce to three- , and four - gauge - boson vertices , whereas the cp - odd ones generate only three- and four - gauge - boson vertices .",
    "there are three independent cp - violating three - gauge - boson vertices , generated by @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "they correspond to terms in the tgv effective lagrangian in eq .",
    "the cp - odd tgv couplings are related to @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 by , @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the on - shell condition for the @xmath2 bosons has been used in deriving the above relations .",

    "it is generated by @xmath97 .",
    "( the cp - violating four - gauge - boson effective interaction described by @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath98 , thus vanishes . )",
    "this c - odd and p - even ( cp - odd ) effective @xmath99 vertex is given by , @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the photon field .",
    "this vertex could be interesting experimentally because of its uniqueness .",
    "for example , it could be studied at an @xmath102 collider via the reaction @xmath103 , which has been used as a probe for the operator @xmath91 in ref .",
    "we now proceed to estimate the above cp - violating tgv parameters in technicolor theories , arising from the underlying etc interactions . we consider a one - family technicolor model , along with the three quark - lepton generations .",
    "the technifermions are taken to belong to the fundamental representation of an @xmath104 technicolor theory , and transform like ordinary fermions under the standard model gauge group .",
    "we assume three different etc scales , one for each family .",
    "the etc scale associated with the first family is much higher than that associated with the second family , and the etc scale for the second family is much higher than that for the third . for simplicity , attention",
    "will first be restricted to the class of etc models in which the etc gauge group commutes with the standard model gauge group .",
    "we will describe the cp violation in the etc interactions in terms of a set of cp - violating , @xmath105 invariant four - fermion operators induced by single massive etc gauge boson exchange .",
    "it can be shown that all the single - etc - boson - induced four - technifermion operators which are @xmath106 invariant are cp - conserving .",
    "it can also be shown that all the cp - violating four - ordinary - fermion operators involve fermions from at least one of the two light families , and are thus suppressed by higher etc scales .",
    "it is only the cp - violating four - fermion operators involving two technifermions and two ordinary fermions from the heaviest family that are suppressed by the lowest etc scale and therefore have the largest cp - violating effects .",
    "the contribution of these four - fermion operators to the cp - odd tgv s turns out to involve two mass insertions of the ordinary fermions .",
    "the largest contribution will therefore come from the cp - violating four - fermion operators consisting of two techniquarks and the ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) doublet .",
    "there are two of them , given by @xcite , @xmath109 + \\mbox{h.c . } \\\\",

    "the @xmath112 s are in general complex , with their magnitudes expected to be of order @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the etc coupling and @xmath19 denotes the mass of the etc boson .",
    "the operator @xmath115 is responsible for the generation of quark masses in technicolor theories , as can be seen by a fierz rearrangement .",
    "when extended to include three families of quarks , it gives rise to the ckm matrix with the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase @xcite .",
    "since cp symmetry is respected by tc interactions , the techniquark condensates will naturally be real .",
    "it can then be shown that @xmath115 with three quark families violates cp only via the km phase in the ckm matrix appearing in @xmath2 couplings to the quarks , as well as in four - fermion operators involving both up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "all cp - violating effects of @xmath115 ( with three families ) will then be suppressed by the small mixing among the three quark - families and will not be considered here .",
    "we turn now to @xmath116 . after the quarks and techniquarks get their masses , we can rewrite the effective etc lagrangian in terms of the mass eigenstates of the fermion fields .",
    "it can then be seen that @xmath116 violates cp conservation even with only one family of quarks .",
    "though the cp phase in @xmath116 could be rotated away by redefining the quark and techniquark fields , it will reappear in other pieces of the effective lagrangian , such as the @xmath2 couplings to @xmath107 , @xmath108 doublet and to techniquarks .",
    "physical cp - violating effects are independent of this phase rotation .",
    "the operator @xmath116 contributes to the cp - odd tgv s via the diagrams shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the techniquarks in fig .",
    "1 will of course experience strong tc interactions .",
    "as is sometimes done in both qcd and technicolor theories , one could model the strong interactions by employing dynamical mass functions @xmath117 for the single - loop of techniquarks and neglecting additional tc interactions .",
    "the @xmath117 s can be determined by solving schwinger - dyson gap equations , with their normalizations fixed by the technipion decay constant @xmath118 ( equivalently the @xmath2 and @xmath64 masses ) @xcite .",
    "after a fierz rearrangement , it can be seen that the cp - odd piece of @xmath116 consists of the product of a charge - changing techniquark current and a charge - changing quark current .",
    "the cp - odd tgv s are induced by diagrams with the two @xmath2 bosons attached separately to the quark and techniquark loops , and the @xmath28 ( @xmath82 or @xmath64 ) boson attached to the quark loop , as in fig .  1 .",
    "as @xmath119 consists of two right - handed currents , two mass insertions are needed on each loop .",
    "the quark loop integral is then finite .",
    "since the techniquarks develop dynamical masses via the strong tc interactions , with their magnitudes on the order of @xmath7 below the technifermion chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath7 and falling rapidly with momentum above @xmath7 , the techniquark loop integral will be highly convergent at momentum scales just above @xmath7 .",
    "the diagrams with the @xmath28 boson attached to the techniquark loop are suppressed by a factor of @xmath120 relative to those with the @xmath28 boson attached to the quark loop as in fig .  1 .",
    "this can be understood as follows : in the former case it is the techniquark mass squared @xmath121 that sets the infrared ( ir ) scale , appearing in the denominator of the technifermion loop integral ; while in the latter it is the top quark mass squared @xmath122 that appears in the the denominator of the quark loop integral .",
    "thus we need consider only the diagrams in fig .  1 .",
    "to simplify the computations , we use a momentum independent techniquark mass on the order of the technifermion chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath7 .",
    "this will give a good order - of - magnitude estimate of the techniquark loop integral , because the two techniquark mass insertions in the integral render this constant - mass computation at most logarithmic divergent , cut off at a scale @xmath123 just above @xmath7 .",
    "as the logarithm is typically of order one , the constant mass estimate is expected to be the same order of magnitude as the dynamical mass calculation .    for the incoming momentum @xmath124 of the @xmath28 ( @xmath82 or @xmath64 )",
    "boson below @xmath7 , the evaluation of the two - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "1 for the cp - violating tgv s gives ( taking the ckm matrix element @xmath125 ) , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the number of colors .",
    "the @xmath32-dependent functions @xmath128 and @xmath129 come from the quark loop integration and are given by , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a polynomial in @xmath132 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 the functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 can be obtained by exchanging @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the above expressions for @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "the @xmath32-independent @xmath141 parameter arises from the techniquark loop integration and is a measure of cp violation at momentum scales just below @xmath7 .    in the constant mass ( @xmath142 ) )",
    "approximation , one is led to the simple expression for @xmath141 , @xmath143 recall that @xmath144 is the coefficient of the cp - violating four - fermion operator @xmath145 in eq.(15 ) , and that the cp - odd piece of @xmath145 is proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath146 ( i.e. @xmath147 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this techniquark loop computation can be viewed as generating the cp - violating , dimension - four chiral lagrangian operator  @xcite , @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the remaining part of the computation leading to eqs .",
    "( 1619 ) then takes place in the low energy chiral lagrangian framework .",
    "considering that the size of @xmath141 estimated later could be of order @xmath151 , this operator suggests the possibility of large cp - violating effects in the decay @xmath152 .    for numerical evaluations , we take @xmath153 , the typical energy at which the lep(200 ) collider operates , and @xmath154 gev . since @xmath32 is then well above @xmath155 threshold , the functions @xmath156 will have an imaginary part as well as a real part .",
