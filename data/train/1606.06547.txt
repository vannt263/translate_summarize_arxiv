    "many researchers have studied problems on the rainbow connection and got plenty of nice results , see @xcite for examples . for more details",
    "we refer to the survey paper @xcite and the book @xcite .",
    "related to the rainbow connection number , researchers have become interested in the following question .",
    "what is the minimum number of passwords or firewalls that allows one or more secure paths between every two agencies where , as we progress from one agency to another along such a path , we are required to change passwords ?",
    "inspired by this , borozan et al .  in @xcite and andrews et al .  in @xcite",

    ", we can easily see that the @xmath20-proper connection number of a graph @xmath0 is actually its @xmath4-proper connection number , i.e. , @xmath21",

    "the strong chromatic index @xmath25 , which was introduced by fouquet and jolivet @xcite , is the minimum number of colors needed in a strong edge - coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "immediately we get that @xmath26 . and",
    "this inspires us to pay particular attention to the @xmath9-proper connection number of a connected graph @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : basic ] , we find some basic properties of the @xmath3-proper connection number of a graph @xmath0 and determine the values of @xmath10 when @xmath0 is a traceable graph , a tree , a complete bipartite graph , a complete multipartite graph , a wheel or a cube .",
    "in section  [ sect:2-conn ] , we study the @xmath9-proper connection number of @xmath0 for any @xmath7-connected graph @xmath0 . finally in section  [",
    "sect : oper ] , we investigate the @xmath9-proper connection numbers of the join and the cartesian product of graphs . also , we obtain the value of @xmath10 in which @xmath0 is a permutation graph of a nontrivial traceable graph .",
    "in this section , we first introduce some definitions and present several basic propositions , which will serve as essential tools in the following proof",
    ". then the @xmath3-proper connection numbers of a series of simple graphs are characterized .    before all of these , we introduce some basic symbols that will appear in the sequel .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected graph .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the number of its vertices and @xmath29 the number of its edges . the _ distance between two vertices _ @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath32 , is the length of a shortest path between them in @xmath0 .",
    "eccentricity _ of a vertex @xmath31 is @xmath33 .",
    "the _ radius _ of @xmath0 is @xmath34 .",
    "we write @xmath35 as the largest sum of degrees of vertices @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are taken over all couples of adjacent vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , we set @xmath38=\\{1,2,\\dots , n\\}$ ] for any integer @xmath39 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath40 , we know that @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 . it can be easily checked that @xmath43 .",
    "the converse also holds since a noncomplete graph must have diameter greater than @xmath44 , and as a result , at least two colors are needed .",
    "apart from this , another two essential properties are posed as follows .",
    "[ sr ] let @xmath0 be a nontrivial connected graph and @xmath45 be an integer , then we have @xmath46 .    from the definition of @xmath3-proper connection number , we know that @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , @xmath47 for all @xmath48 since every distance @xmath2-proper path is also an distance @xmath49-proper path .",
    "what s more , a rainbow path is no doubt a @xmath19-proper path for all @xmath19 with @xmath50 and @xmath12 must be no greater than @xmath29 .    [ spanning ]",
    "if @xmath0 is a nontrivial connected graph , @xmath51 is a connected spanning subgraph of @xmath0 and @xmath45 is an integer , then @xmath52 .",
    "particularly , @xmath53 for every spanning tree @xmath54 of @xmath0 .",
    "certainly a @xmath22-proper - path coloring of @xmath51 can be extended to a @xmath22-proper - path coloring of @xmath0 by arbitrarily assigning used colors to the remaining edges .",
    "this implies @xmath52 .",
    "we also give the following result for the @xmath22-proper connection number of the traceable graphs , i.e. , graphs containing a hamiltonian path .",
    "[ traceable ] let @xmath0 be a traceable graph and @xmath2 be a positive integer , then @xmath55 .",
    "particularly , @xmath56 .",
    "we simply consider a hamiltonian path of @xmath0 and color the edges in the sequence of @xmath57 .",
    "next we discuss the @xmath22-proper connection numbers of the trees , complete bipartite graphs , complete multipartite graphs , wheels and cubes .",
    "first , we show that the @xmath9-proper connection number of a tree @xmath54 is closely related to @xmath58 .",
    "[ tree ] if @xmath54 is a nontrivial tree , then @xmath59 .",
    "it is known that in a tree , every path is the unique path connecting its two end vertices , so we have to make sure that every path in this tree is a distance @xmath7-proper path .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be two vertices such that @xmath60 .",
    "then we define the edge @xmath61 to be _ level _ @xmath62 and give an edge @xmath63 _ level _",
    "@xmath64 if any path containing @xmath63 and @xmath61 has exactly @xmath65 edges in between .",
    "we also define the _ parent _ of each vertex @xmath31 to be the vertex adjacent to it on the path from @xmath31 to @xmath36(or @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus every vertex @xmath31 except @xmath36 and @xmath37 has a unique parent , denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "child _ of a vertex @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath67 , is a vertex @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "next we begin to give our coloring .",
    "the colors of edges incident to either @xmath36 or @xmath37 must be pairwise different because every pair of these edges lies on a path with fewer than @xmath7 edges in between .",
    "this means that @xmath54 requires at least @xmath70 colors and so @xmath71 .",
    "note that this assigns distinct colors to all edges of levels @xmath62 and @xmath44 .",
    "suppose we have given colors to all edges of levels @xmath72 , now randomly choose an edge @xmath73 of level @xmath74 .",
    "obviously all edges incident to @xmath75 have not been given colors yet since they all have level @xmath76 except for @xmath63 .",
    "thus we only need to consider the colored edges which are incident to either @xmath68 or @xmath77 .",
    "and the total number of all these edges is at most @xmath70 . in this way we can choose a color for @xmath63 that does not appear on an edge incident to @xmath68 or @xmath77",
    "consequently , we can color all edges of level @xmath74 . repeating this procedure ,",
    "the coloring of @xmath54 is well defined .",
    "one can easily check this is a @xmath7-proper - path coloring of @xmath54 , which proves that @xmath59 .    for a nontrivial tree @xmath54 ,",
    "the proof of the above theorem suggests the method to find the value of @xmath78 for general @xmath2 . from the set of subtrees with diameter @xmath79",
    ", we choose a subtree @xmath80 with maximum size and color all its edges with distinct colors .",
    "if @xmath2 is odd , then we take all edges in @xmath80 adjacent to some @xmath81 as _ level @xmath62 _ of @xmath54 , where @xmath82 . if @xmath2 is even",
    ", then we choose some edge @xmath83 as _ level @xmath62 _ of @xmath54 , where @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , we divide @xmath85 into different levels and color the edges of @xmath54 successively . as a result , we can obtain the following corollary .",
    "[ corollary1 ] for @xmath54 a nontrivial tree , @xmath78 is equal to the maximum size of subtrees with diameter @xmath79 of @xmath54 .    for @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 for any tree @xmath54 . together with theorem [ tree ] , we get the following corollary .",
    "[ corollary2 ] for every pair of integers @xmath88 where @xmath89 , there exists a connected graph @xmath0 such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
