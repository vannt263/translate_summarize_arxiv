    "at very high energies , production of multiple higgs and electro - weak vector bosons becomes kinematically possible .",
    "the cross - sections for such processes , computed in perturbation theory , become unsuppressed above a certain critical value of final state multiplicities , and continue to grow with energy eventually violating perturbative unitarity @xcite .",
    "this results in the breakdown of a weakly coupled perturbation theory and a transition into a non - perturbative regime where the intermediate state formed during the collision is characterised by a collective multi - boson configuration with large occupation numbers .",
    "the critical energies were the perturbative high - multiplicity rates become large were estimated recently in @xcite and were found to be in the @xmath1 - @xmath2 tev range ",
    "i.e. nearly in the reach of current and future experiments .",
    "the aim of this paper is to further improve and quantify the critical values of energies and multiplicities for the multi - higgs boson production .",
    "we will argue that already for a 50 tev hadron collider , the rapid growth of perturbative rates in our model can lead to picobarn cross - sections for processes with @xmath3 higgs bosons .",
    "there is a strong similarity , already noted in @xcite , between these novel perturbative unitarity problems at high multiplicities with hundred tev energies , and the well - known unitarity problem for simple 2 to 2 scattering processes of massive vector bosons .",
    "this resulted in a powerful and far - reaching conclusion formulated in @xcite that one of the three options has to be realised : either ( 1 ) there exists a higgs boson with a mass below @xmath4  tev , or ( 2 ) there should be new physics beyond the standard model , or , finally ( 3 ) scattering processes of electroweak gauge bosons become non - perturbative .",
    "this three - fold way forward for electro - weak physics was answered and resolved by the observation of a higgs boson at @xmath5  gev .",
    "now , with the high - multiplicity scatterings at @xmath6 tev centre of mass energies , the perturbative electro - weak physics faces a similar cross - roads .    to obtain a reliable estimate for multi - higgs production processes at energies relevant for future circular hadron colliders ( fcc ) which kinematically allow for very high higgs multiplicities in the final state",
    ", one has to overcome a number of complications .",
    "there are two immediate technical problems one encounters already at the leading order in perturbation theory :    1 .",
    "the dominant higgs production is via the gluon fusion process @xmath7 , and it requires a computation of feynman diagrams involving 1-loop polygons with @xmath8 edges where @xmath9 is the number of the outgoing higgs lines , for all @xmath10 .",
    "the number of the contributing polygon types and of the corresponding kinematic invariants they depend on , grow with @xmath11 and ultimately explode in the high multiplicity limit @xmath12 .",
    "this provides for a challenging computation .",
    "the number of feynman diagrams describing the subsequent tree - level branching processes @xmath13 from each of the polygon s external lines @xmath14 , is known to grow factorially with @xmath11 , and this is reflected in a factorial explosion of perturbative amplitudes , as shown in refs .",
    "+ based on these considerations it was argued in @xcite that the standard weakly coupled perturbation theory in the electro - weak sector of the standard model breaks down for multi - particle production of higgses and massive vector bosons at energy scales as low as @xmath15 tev .",
    "the energies where electro - weak processes could enter a novel effectively strongly - coupled regime , where the ultra - high multiplicity production of relatively soft bosons would become unsuppressed and dominate the total rates may be potentially within the reach of the next generation of colliders .",
    "we will address the two problems listed above in stages : first we will consider the polygon contributions to the multi - higgs cross - sections by working in the high - energy limit @xmath16 with a fixed number of higgses , @xmath17fixed",
    ". then we will combine these fixed - multiplicity loop - level results in the ultra - high - energy limit with the subsequent tree - level branchings . here",

    "we will now present the result for these amplitudes on multi - higgs mass thresholds .",
    "the computation of polygons contributions to the processes combined with the subsequent branchings and the resulting estimate for the multi - higgs production cross - sections , which is the main motivation of this paper , will be addressed in sections * [ sec : poly]*-*[sec : pdfs]*.      at tree - level , all @xmath11-point scattering amplitudes for an off - shell field @xmath25 to produce @xmath11 higgs particles , @xmath26 , can be obtained from a classical solution of the euler - lagrange equations corresponding to the higgs lagrangian @xmath27 following the generating functions technique initiated in ref .",

    "such threshold amplitudes were further generalised to other scalar field theories and also computed at one - loop and resummed multi - loop level in refs .",

    "are still given by the classical solution @xmath44 of equations of motion  they are no longer uniform in space , having instead the @xmath45 spherical symmetry .",
    "these solutions are uniquely specified by the same initial conditions as @xmath46 , and are singular on hypersurfaces in the euclidean space - time .",

    "this is a complicated procedure , and the closed - form expressions for such @xmath45 symmetric solutions are presently unknown even in the simplest scalar qft models .",
