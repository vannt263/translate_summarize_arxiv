    "in the surroundings of hot ob - associations filamentary substructures on different scales are observed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . as observational resolution increases ,",
    "more and more sub - millimeter sources , which could trace the birth of future stars are detected ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has long been suggested that radiation driven implosion of molecular clouds can explain the morphology and the star formation in these regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent simulations ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) demonstrate the importance of massive stars for the subsequent evolution of their parental molecular clouds .",
    "the ionising radiation is a vital ingredient to understand the disruption of molecular clouds and their star formation efficiency .",
    "our goal is to investigate the morphology of molecular clouds and the formation of protostars in much greater detail .",
    "to do so we use very high resolution simulations of a small region of a molecular cloud ionised by a massive nearby star .",
    "we use the prescription for ionising uv - radiation of a young massive star proposed by @xcite .",
    "the ionisation degree @xmath0 is related to the hydrodynamical quantities by an approximation for the resulting temperature of a partly ionised gas @xmath1 @xmath2 is the initial temperature of the cold , unionised gas and @xmath3 is the temperature of the ionised gas .    to treat the hydrodynamic and gravitational evolution we use a parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code called vine ( wetzstein , in prep . ) .",
    "its lagrangian nature renders it extremely adept to cover several orders of magnitude in density and time , which is important to follow local gas collapse .",
    "we assume plane - parallel uv - irradiation of the simulated area , mimicking a radiation source sufficiently far away such that its distance is larger than the dimensions of the area of infall .",
    "to couple ionisation to hydrodynamics we use a flux conserving ray - shooting algorithm .",
    "a two dimensional grid is superimposed on the area of interest . along each of the thereby created bins ,",
    "the optical depth is calculated .",
    "the size of each bin , i.e. the grid resolution is defined by the volume each sph - particle occupies .",
    "this guarantees that the density information given by the sph - formalism is transformed to the calculation of radiation correctly .",
    "this implementation is fully parallelised .",
    "we call it ivine ( ionisation+vine ) .",
    "a standard test for numerical implementations of ionizing radiation has been proposed by .",
    "it deals with the steady propagation of an ionisation front : a box of constant density is exposed to a time - dependent ionising source .",
    "the initial conditions were chosen to be @xmath4 and @xmath5 to enable a direct comparison to their results .",
    "the flux increases linearly with time , starting at zero : @xmath6 .",
    "the recombination parameter @xmath7 is set to @xmath8 .",
    "the ionised temperature is @xmath9 . at the beginning a small fraction of the box is ionised . due to the higher temperature of the ionised gas a shock front evolves .",
    "this shock front moves at a constant speed through the box .",
    "the analytical solution provides the exact position and speed of the front as well as of the ionised gas at any given time .",
    "we find a very good agreement with the analytical solution , the results are shown in table [ leflochtbl ] .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the number density of the compressed layer and of the ionised gas , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the velocities of the ionisation front and the shock front respectively .",

    "the first high resolution simulations we performed with the new code address the effect of ionising radiation on a box of turbulent medium . we choose the initial conditions to mimick observed turbulence in the ism . the cubic simulation domain with a volume of @xmath14 and a mean density of @xmath15 is set up with a temperature of @xmath16 .",
    "the turbulent velocity field is set up adapting a gaussian random field with a steep power spectrum .",
    "the velocity field generates density fluctuations and after a dynamical timescale a turbulent medium with typical velocities of mach 5 has been generated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_init ] ) . at this point",
    "the box is exposed to ionising radiation .",
    "the uv - radiation is impinging form the negative x - direction with a flux @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to a rapid ionisation of the first @xmath18 of the cube before the medium reacts to the increased temperature of the ionised gas .",
    "the simulations were performed with 2 million particles on a sgi altix supercomputer .",
    "the uv - radiation traces the turbulent density distribution , reaching further into the low density regions , and less far in the regions of high density . after a dynamical timescale",
    "the hydrodynamics react to the increase in temperature , shock fronts evolve and compress the gas while at the same time increasing the turbulent energy of the cold gas . during this phase",
    "a typical morphology evolves .",
    "the denser regions shadow regions behind them whereas in lower density regimes the radiation can propagate much further . after the first phase of maximum compression a more quiescent phase of evaporation sets in .",
    "the densities are not as high as before , but the structures become even more clear .",
    "this leads in the final stage to filamentary , pillar - like substructures , pointing towards the source of radiation as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_end ] .",
    "the structures contain high density regions in their tips .",
    "these a very likely to become gravitational unstable after a free fall time .",
    "we developed a fully parallel treatment for the ionising radiation of young massive stars .",
    "ionising radiation alone is sufficient to explain the morphology observed in the surroundings of hot ob - clusters . in our simulations of turbulent ism exposed to uv - radiation characteristic trunks similar to the ones observed in m16 evolve .",
    "further studies including gravity will show whether the uv - radiation from young massive stars is sufficient to trigger gravitational collapse within these pillars ."
