    "the influence of disorder on phase transitions and critical phenomena has attracted a considerable interest in the last decades . in the absence of frustration ,",
    "it is now well established that a first - order phase transition is smoothed by the introduction of randomness and can be made continuous at large enough disorder strength  @xcite . in 2d ,",
    "an infinitesimal disorder is sufficient to remove any discontinuity  .",
    "when the pure system undergoes already a continuous phase transition , the harris criterion predicts that the universality class of the pure model will be affected by disorder if the specific heat diverges , i.e. if the critical exponent @xmath2 is positive  @xcite . in this context , the @xmath0-state potts model has been a useful toy model , because it displays a rich phase diagram involving two lines of respectively first and second - order phase transition . along the latter , the universality class depends on the number of states @xmath0 . on the practical side ,",
    "efficient monte carlo and transfer matrix algorithms exist for this model and conformal invariance can be used in 2d in combination with renormalisation group ( rg ) .    in comparison ,",
    "correlated disorder was much less studied . nevertheless in some experimental situations ,",
    "impurities can not be considered as uncorrelated .",
    "this is in particular the case when they carry an electric charge or a magnetic moment and are coupled via an electromagnetic interaction . on the theoretical side , weinrib and halperin studied the @xmath3 model with a random mass and showed that a new rg fixed point , distinct from the random and the pure ones , emerges in the phase diagram when the correlations of this mass decay algebraically  @xcite . for a sufficiently slow decay of these disorder correlations ,",
    "the new fixed point becomes stable . denoting @xmath4",
    "the exponent of the algebraic decay of disorder correlations , the perturbation is relevant when @xmath5 if the correlation length exponent @xmath6 of the pure model satisfies the inequality @xmath7 . at the new fixed point ,",
    "correlated disorder is marginally irrelevant , which implies that that @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic exponent @xmath9 remains small compared to @xmath10 . even though still controversial",
    ", these predictions were confirmed by monte carlo simulations of the 3d ising model with @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "we recently studied by large - scale monte carlo simulations the influence of correlated couplings on the 2d potts model  @xcite .",
    "like in the absence of disorder correlation , the first - order phase transition , occurring for the pure model when @xmath12 , was shown to be smoothed and replaced by a continuous transition .",
    "however , the new universality class was shown to be @xmath0-independent , a feature shared by the strong - disorder fixed point of the @xmath0-state potts model with a layered mccoy - wu - like disorder .",
    "this result is remarkably different from the continuous increase of the magnetic scaling dimension @xmath13 observed for the potts model with an uncorrelated disorder .",
    "more intriguing is the fact that the phase diagram displays a griffiths phase , as in the mccoy - wu model , where the magnetic susceptibility diverges with the lattice size .",
    "interestingly , such a phase has been predicted by weinrib and halperin , but only above the upper critical dimension @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the hyperscaling relation @xmath15 was observed to be broken in the griffiths phase , as a result of large disorder fluctuations .",
    "however , these observations were made for finite systems so one can not exclude the possibility that , at much larger lattice sizes , the griffiths phase collapse into a single point , the critical point , where the hyperscaling relation would be restored . moreover ,",
    "the estimate of the correlation length exponent @xmath6 is incompatible with weinrib - halperin exact result @xmath8 , which substantiates the idea that the lattice sizes considered could be too small and that a cross - over would be observed at much larger lattice sizes . on the other hand , no significant evolution of the griffiths phase",
    "could be observed in the range of lattice sizes studied  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the conspiracy of two amplitudes that leads to the violation of the hyperscaling relation is well verified and no sign of deviation at large lattice sizes is observed .    since larger lattice sizes are not accessible by monte carlo simulations , we turn our attention in this work to larger exponents @xmath4 of the disorder correlations .",
    "the fact that weinrib - halperin predictions were confirmed by monte carlo simulations of the 3d ising model with @xmath11 could indicate that finite - size effects are weaker for larger values of @xmath4 . in refs",
    "@xcite , only small values of @xmath4 were considered because disorder configurations were generated by simulating an auxiliary ashkin - teller model on a self - dual line where its critical exponents are known exactly .",
    "the polarisation density was then used to construct the couplings @xmath16 of the potts model .",
    "disorder correlations correspond therefore to the polarisation - polarisation correlations of the auxiliary ashkin - teller model .",
    "when moving along the self - dual line , only exponents in the range @xmath17 $ ] can be obtained .    in this work ,",
    "we present new data for disorder correlation exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 obtained by using an auxiliary ashkin - teller model . in order to investigate the possible existence of a cross - over towards the weinrib - halperin fixed point",
    ", we considered also the values @xmath20 and @xmath11 obtained using the 3d and 4d ising models as auxiliary models to generate the disorder configurations . in the first section , details about the models and the monte carlo simulations are given . in the second section , the behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath21 is discussed . as already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath21 diverge algebraically with the lattice size in a broad interval of temperatures , identified as a griffiths phase , when @xmath4 is sufficiently small .",
    "a simple explanation of this phenomena is to assume that disorder fluctuations induce a spreading of local transition temperatures . because these fluctuations vanish as @xmath22",
    ", this would imply that a single peak would be recovered at large lattice sizes .",
    "the smaller the exponent @xmath4 and the larger the lattice sizes needed to observe a single peak . in the second section , numerical evidence is given that disorder fluctuations are not sufficient to explain the observed griffiths phase , and therefore , that the latter phase can not be expected to collapse as @xmath22 . in the third section , the possibility of a cross - over controlled by the amplitude of disorder correlations is considered .",
    "these amplitudes are compared for the different disorder correlations considered and , then different disorder strengths are studied . finally , conclusions follow .",
    "the classical @xmath0-state potts model is the lattice spin model defined by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath23 where the spin @xmath24 takes @xmath0 possible values and is located on the @xmath25-th node of the lattice .",
    "the sum extends over all pairs @xmath26 of nearest neighbours on the lattice . in the following",
    ", the potts model will be considered on the square lattice . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the phase transition is continuous for @xmath27 and of first - order when @xmath12 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath28 , i.e. a point in the regime of first - order transition .",
    "disorder is now introduced as bond - dependent random exchange couplings @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath29 the spatial correlations between these couplings is assumed to decay algebraically with an exponent @xmath4 at large distance : @xmath30 for convenience , we will restrict ourselves in the following to a binary coupling distribution , i.e. @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of disorder correlations does not affect the self - duality condition of the random potts model . imposing @xmath33 and @xmath32 to be equiprobable and self - dual of each other ,",
    "the self - dual line is given by the condition  @xcite @xmath34    the coupling configurations are generated by independent monte carlo simulations of two auxiliary models : the ising and ashkin - teller models .",
    "the former is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath35 and is equivalent to the @xmath36 potts model .",
    "it is well known that this model undergoes a second - order phase transition in any dimension @xmath37 .",
    "we considered hypercubic lattices of dimension @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a few thousand spin configurations are generated at the critical point , corresponding to @xmath40 for @xmath38  @xcite and @xmath41 for @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "for each spin configuration , a two - dimensional section is cut and random couplings for the 2d potts model are constructed as @xmath42 for each pair @xmath26 of nearest neighbours in the 2d section . note that , at any site @xmath25 , two couplings , in two different directions , are identical . by construction ,",
    "disorder correlation functions @xmath43 decay as the spin - spin correlation functions of the auxiliary ising model .",
    "therefore , the decay is algebraic at large distances with an exponent @xmath44 for the 3d ising model  @xcite and @xmath11 for the 4d ising model .",
    "note that , in the second case , the exponent @xmath4 is equal to the dimension @xmath45 of the potts model . therefore , according to weinrib and halperin , disorder correlations are expected to be irrelevant and the system falls into the same universality class as the potts model with independent random couplings .",

    ", we considered two points on the self - dual line of the ashkin - teller model ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the language of the eight - vertex model ) corresponding to exponents @xmath18 and @xmath51 .    the above - described spin models were simulated using monte carlo cluster algorithms to reduce the critical slowing - down . for the ising and potts models ,",
    "the swendsen - wang algorithm was employed  @xcite .",
    "the ashkin - teller was simulated using a cluster algorithm introduced by wiseman and domany  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath52 of a finite system undergoing a continuous phase transition in the thermodynamic limit is expected to display a peak whose maximum diverges with the lattice size @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "the location of this maximum goes towards the critical temperature @xmath55 in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "a very different situation was observed in the 2d potts model with strongly correlated disorder  @xcite . as can be seen on figure  [ fig2 ] ,",
    "two peaks are present for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the data show an algebraic increase of the average magnetic susceptibility for all temperatures between these two peaks . for this reason ,",
    "this region was conjectured to be a griffiths phase , similar to the one observed in the mccoy - wu model .",
    "the absence of any evolution of the location of the two peaks was reported in the case @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ fig2 ] shows a slow evolution in the case @xmath51 .",
    "since only lattice sizes up to @xmath57 were studied , the possibility of a collapse of the griffiths phase into a single point in the thermodynamic limit can not be excluded .",

    "two peaks are still visible but they tend to come closer when the lattice size is increased .",
