    "<S> it is known that in classical fluids turbulence typically occurs at high reynolds numbers . but can turbulence occur at low reynolds numbers ? here we investigate the transition to turbulence in the classic taylor - couette system in which the rotating fluids are manufactured ferrofluids with magnetized nanoparticles embedded in liquid carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the presence of a magnetic field turbulence can occur at reynolds numbers that are at least one order of magnitude smaller than those in conventional fluids . </S>",
    "<S> this is established by extensive computational ferrohydrodynamics through a detailed bifurcation analysis and characterization of behaviors of physical quantities such as the energy , the wave number , and the angular momentum through the bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> a striking finding is that , as the magnetic field is increased , the onset of turbulence can be determined accurately and reliably . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that experimental investigation of turbulence can be greatly facilitated by using ferrofluids , opening up a new avenue to probe into the fundamentals of turbulence and the challenging problem of turbulence control .    </S>",
    "<S> turbulence have been subject to intensive studies as a central issue in the modern science . in classical newtonian fluid </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that the occurrence of turbulence depends on the reynolds number  @xcite , and typically in high reynolds number . here </S>",
    "<S> the reynolds number ( @xmath0 ) is a dimensionless quantity defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the characteristic length scale and a typical velocity of the flow in a particular geometry , respectively , and @xmath4 is the kinematic viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 may differ essentially from the size of the streamline body and mean velocity around , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore for different flow systems the critical value of @xmath0 can be very different and even approaches infinity , for example , in pipe flows  @xcite . in the paradigmatic </S>",
    "<S> setting of a uniform flow of velocity @xmath3 flowing past a cylinder of diameter @xmath2 , when @xmath0 is of the order of tens , the flow is regular . for @xmath0 in the hundreds , von krmn vortex street forms behind the cylinder  @xcite , breaking certain symmetries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> fully developed turbulence , in which the broken symmetries are restored , occurs at very high reynolds number , typically in the thousands . in situations where turbulence occurs at high reynolds numbers , its study may be challenging , both experimentally where flow systems of enormous size and/or high velocity are required and computationally where unconventionally high resolution in the numerical integration of the navier - stokes equation is needed . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus desirable that fluid turbulence can emerge in physical flows of relatively low reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile the ` way ' that turbulence arises can be very different ! </S>",
    "<S> consider the three - dimensional navier - stokes equations , mainly four routes were studied so far  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these present special characteristics and states with ( i ) quasi - periodicity ( with two frequencies on two tori ) and phase locking , ( ii ) subharmonic ( period doubling ) bifurcations , ( iii ) three frequencies ( on two- and/or three tori ) , and ( iv ) intermittent noise .    thus it is known that fully developed turbulence may occur after a set of bifurcations  @xcite , as in a circular couette flow with rotating inner cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , transition to fully developed turbulence may depend not only on the reynolds number , but on the particular characteristics of the flow evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was observed experimentally that the flow of a sufficiently elastic polymer solutions can become irregular even at low velocity , high viscosity and in a small tank that corresponds to very small reynolds number ( on the order of unity ) . </S>",
    "<S> this flow has all the main features of fully developed turbulence : a broad range of spatial and temporal scales . in general </S>",
    "<S> the understanding and  turbulence control \"  @xcite potentially has a large impact on society in particular in economical interests . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dissipation of turbulent flows is much larger than that of laminar ones . </S>",
    "<S> consequently it is more costly to transport fluid through a vessel or to propel a vehicle if the flow is turbulent . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in oil pipelines the pressures required to pump the fluid is typically up to thirty times larger than would be necessary if the flow could be held laminar . </S>",
    "<S> thus to keep the flow laminar until higher reynolds numbers nowadays it is common to add polymers into the flow in oil pipelines . </S>",
    "<S> similar one could think to add ferrofluids in circular closed systems to keep the flow laminar due to an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> studying transition to turbulence in non - newton fluid systems continues to be an interesting topic .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the taylor - couette flow  @xcite in finite systems ( e.g. , aspect ratio @xmath5 ) where a rotating _ ferrofluid _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is confined by axial end walls , i.e. , non - rotating lids , in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the classic taylor - couette flow of non - ferrofluid has been a computational  @xcite and experimental  @xcite paradigm to investigate a variety of nonlinear and complex dynamical phenomena , including the transition to turbulence at high reynolds numbers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ferrofluid system we study consists of two independently rotating , concentric cylinders with viscous ferrofluid filled in between , which has embedded within itself artificially dispersed magnetized nanoparticles . in the absence of the external magnetic field , the magnetic moments of the nanoparticles are randomly oriented , leading to zero net magnetization for the entire fluid . in this case , the magnetized nanoparticles have little effect on the physical properties of the fluid such as density and viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , when a transverse magnetic field is applied , the physical properties of the fluid can be significantly modified  @xcite , leading to drastic changes in the underlying hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for systems of rotating ferrofluid  @xcite , an external magnetic field can stabilize regular dynamical states  @xcite and induce dramatic changes in the flow topology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( in fact , the effects of magnetic field are particularly important for geophysical flows  @xcite ) . in general , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field can be used effectively as a control or bifurcation parameter of the system , whose change can lead to characteristically distinct types of hydrodynamical behaviors  @xcite . in this regard , transition to turbulence in magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) flows with current - driven instabilities of helical fields has been investigated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a large body of literature on mhd dynamics in taylor - couette flows  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> existing works on rotating ferrofluids  @xcite , however , are mostly concerned with steady _ time - independent _ flows . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent ferrofluid flows have been investigated only recently but in the non - turbulent regime  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between ferrofluid and magnetic field leads to additional terms in the navier - stokes equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive computations reveals a sequence of bifurcations leading to time - dependent flow solutions such as standing waves with periodic or quasiperiodic oscillations , and turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that turbulence can occur for reynolds numbers at least one order of magnitude smaller than those required for turbulence to arise in conventional fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of turbulence is ascertained by a bifurcation analysis and by examining the characteristics of the physical quantities such as the energy , the wave number , and the angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the onset of turbulence can be determined accurately , in contrast to classical fluid turbulence where such a determination is typically qualitative and involves a high degree of uncertainty  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our findings have the following implications :    * ferrofluids under magnetic field is a new paradigm for investigating turbulence , especially experimentally where the study can be greatly facilitated due to the dramatic relaxation in the reynolds - number requirement . * </S>",
    "<S> the critical magnetic - field strength for the onset of turbulence can be pinned down precisely , possibly leading to deeper insights into the physical and dynamical origins of the transition . </S>",

    "<S> the implications , besides the surprising phenomenon of turbulence at very low reynolds numbers and consequently facilitation of experimental study of turbulence , lie in the perspective of controlled generation of turbulence through variations of the external magnetic field , making it possible to locate the onset of turbulence with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> we expect these findings to have values for experimental as well as theoretical investigation of turbulence . </S>",
