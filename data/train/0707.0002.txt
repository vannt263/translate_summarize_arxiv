    "in recent years people have become interested in higher - dimensional spacetimes with motivation , among others , coming from string theories .",
    "one of the important classes of exact solutions of the einstein equations are the spacetimes representing black holes . in the last years",
    "various generalizations of black hole solutions to the higher - dimensional gravity have been discovered . starting with nonrotating and rotating black holes @xcite and following with the metric describing the rotating black hole with the cosmological constant in five dimensions @xcite ,",
    "the generally rotating black hole in arbitrary dimension with the cosmological constant was found in @xcite . in 2006 this solution",
    "was rewritten @xcite in much more convenient coordinates which allowed to add nut parameters and compute the curvature tensors explicitly  @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of this solution have been discussed in various papers .",
    "it has been shown that the spacetime possesses hidden symmetries which can be described by the principal killing - yano tensor @xcite , the properties of which have been thoroughly discussed in @xcite .",
    "one of the main consequences of these hidden symmetries is a possibility to find a complete set of integration constants for a geodesic motion which are in involution @xcite .",
    "this result is related to the the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation which , together with the separability of the klein - gordon equation , was demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "it seems that a generalization of the black hole solution to include an electromagnetic field is not straightforward .",
    "some partial results are know @xcite , however a solution representing a rotating black hole with electromagnetic field parameterized by full number of black hole parameters and electric / magnetic charges is not known .    in this work we present the test electromagnetic field on the background described by the metric with the structure of black hole solution @xcite",
    ", however , we do not enforce the specific form of the metric function @xmath0 which is needed to satisfy the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "the electromagnetic field is described by @xmath1 electric and magnetic charges and it is adjusted to the explicit as well as hidden symmetries of the spacetime . in even dimensions",
    "our field is equivalent to the harmonic forms independently found in @xcite , our results supply the proof that these forms are harmonic in all even dimensions .",
    "we also show that our field is a generalization of the electromagnetic field known from the carter @xcite and plebaski",
    " demiaski @xcite form of the black hole solution in @xmath2 . in this special case , however , the metric function can be modified in such a way that that the metric and the electromagnetic field satisfy the full coupled einstein ",
    "maxwell equations .",
    "unfortunately , the same is not true in the higher - dimensional case .",
    "the plan of the paper is following .",
    "we discuss separately even and odd spacetime dimensions ",
    "although our procedure is very similar in both cases , the resulting expressions are slightly different and it would be artificial to try to them into the same equations .",
    "we discuss the case of even dimensions in detail and than sketch the corresponding results for the odd dimensions .",
    "first we review the metric and the symmetries of the black hole spacetime , next we find the test electromagnetic field to the symmetries of the spacetime .",
    "for even dimensions we also discuss the case of the physical dimension @xmath2 , in the odd dimension case we study the chern ",
    "simons modification of the electromagnetic field .",
    "finally , we discuss a possibility to generalize our fields to a solution of the coupled einstein ",
    "maxwell equations .",
    "the results are recapitulated in the summary and the paper is concluded by the technical appendix .",
    "we start with a simpler case of even spacetime dimension @xmath3 .",

    "in the following we consider a broader class of spacetimes than merely the black hole spacetime , namely we just assume that the metric functions @xmath0 depend arbitrarily on a _ single _ coordinate , @xmath14 .",
    "for the black hole spacetime they acquire a specific from ( see below ) determined by the vacuum einstein equations .",

    "the inverse relations can be easily obtained with help of the relations in the appendix .",
    "let us note that the definition of unnormalized 1-forms @xmath16 and vectors @xmath23 does not depend on the metric functions  @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the ricci curvature for such a metric is @xmath24 where @xmath25\\period \\end{split}\\raisetag{5ex}\\ ] ] the scalar curvature simplifies to @xmath26 here , the primes denote the differentiation with respect to the single argument of the metric function , @xmath27 .",
    "the requirement that the metric satisfies the einstein equations with the cosmological constant implies that the metric functions have the form @xmath28 see @xcite or in the appendix .",
    "the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are then related to the cosmological constants , angular momenta , mass , and nut charges , see , e.g. , @xcite for details . for @xmath31",
    "we obtain @xcite the constant curvature spacetime with the scalar curvature @xmath32 .",
    "the spacetime with the metric possesses the explicit symmetries given by the killing vectors @xmath33 and hidden symmetries which are related to the principal killing - yano tensor discovered in @xcite and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the principal killing - yano tensor is dual to the rank-2 closed conformal killing - yano tensor which has a very simple form in the frames @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath34 it has been demonstrated in @xcite that it is possible to generate a series of higher - rank killing ",
    "yano tensors and a series of rank-2 killing tensors from @xmath35 . the conformal killing ",
    "yano tensor also identifies eigenspaces spanned on the pairs @xmath36 and coordinates @xmath5 as corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "now we turn to the task to find an algebraically special test electromagnetic fields on the background given by the metric . by",
    "_ algebraically special _ we mean that the maxwell tensor @xmath37 shares the explicit symmetry of the metric ( it is independent of @xmath7 ) and it is aligned with the hidden symmetry of the spacetime , namely it has the same eigenspaces as the principal conformal killing - yano tensor @xmath35 .",
    "we thus require @xmath38    the maxwell tensor is generated by the vector potential , @xmath39 .",
    "we assume the vector potential @xmath40 with the components @xmath41 and @xmath42 independent of @xmath7 . comparing @xmath43",
    "with we find that @xmath41 terms are gauge - trivial and @xmath42 must satisfy @xmath44 , from which follows that the vector potential can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are functions of a _ single variable _ only , @xmath47 . evaluating the maxwell tensor we get the components @xmath48 : @xmath49    alternatively , we could apply directly the first maxwell equation @xmath50 to the maxwell tensor .",
    "with help of identity we find that @xmath48 are generated by an auxiliary potential @xmath51 , @xmath52 which satisfies the equation @xmath53 the field found above is generated by the potential @xmath54    next we proceed to calculate the source @xmath55 of the electromagnetic field using the second maxwell equation @xmath56 .",
    "expressing the maxwell tensor in coordinates @xmath57 , using @xmath58 , the fact that the determinant @xmath59 of the metric in these coordinates is @xmath60 , identities , , and relations , we obtain @xmath61 with @xmath62\\period\\ ] ] substituting we finally obtain @xmath63\\period\\ ] ] it is worth to mention that the expression for the source  @xmath55 does not contain any reference to the metric functions  @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in the electromagnetic field without sources , so we require @xmath64 .",
    "integrating we find that the sum in the square brackets has to be a constant .",
    "however , this sum has a special form discussed in the appendix .",
    "using we find that @xmath65 are given by a single polynomial of the @xmath66-th order in variable @xmath67 .",
    "integrating once more we find @xmath68 substituting into the vector potential or the scalar potential we find with help of the relations that the terms containing the constants @xmath69 are gauge trivial ( they contribute by @xmath70 into @xmath71 or by just the constant @xmath72 into @xmath51 ) and they can be ignored .",
    "we thus have found that the algebraically special electromagnetic field ( i.e. , the field of the form ) satisfies the maxwell equations on the background described by the metric if and only if it is generated by the vector potential @xmath73 the components @xmath48 of the maxwell tensor are easily determined by from the auxiliary potential @xmath74 and they are @xmath75 here , @xmath76 are constants which can be related using the gauss and stokes theorems to the electric and magnetic charges of the field .",
    "if we set all charges except one , say @xmath77 , to zero , the maxwell tensor @xmath37 corresponds to the harmonic form @xmath78 recently found and verified for particular cases in @xcite .",
    "the surprising property of our field is that it satisfies the maxwell equations independently of a specific form of the metric functions @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , as we will see in , the stress - energy tensor corresponding to the field has the form consistent with the structure of the ricci ( and the einstein ) tensor .",
    "these facts open a possibility that we could solve the full einstein ",
    "maxwell equations : modifying the metric functions @xmath0 we could construct the spacetime in which the stress - energy tensor  @xmath79 would be a source for the einstein equations , and the electromagnetic field would remain the solution of the maxwell equations .    first , we will show that this goal can be achieved in @xmath2 dimensions . unfortunately , next we will demonstrate that this procedure does not work in higher dimensions .",
    "the metric is a generalization of the @xmath2 black hole solution in the form found by carter @xcite and elaborated by plebaski and demiaski @xcite .",
    "the full class of plebaski  demiaski solutions includes accelerated rotating nut and electromagnetically charged black holes .",
    "the meaning of all parameters of the solutions was recently discussed in the series of papers @xcite .",
    "we use the charged plebaski ",
    "demiaski metric with the acceleration set to zero : .",
    "here we also used the gauge freedom to set @xmath80 and redefined @xmath81 . ]",
    "@xmath82 where @xmath83 the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath84 here @xmath85 are temporal , radial , latitudinal , and longitudinal coordinates , @xmath86 are parameters related to mass , nut charge , angular momentum , and cosmological constant , and @xmath87 are electric and magnetic charges .",
    "this metric and the electromagnetic field satisfy coupled einstein  maxwell equations . for @xmath88",
    "the metric satisfies the vacuum einstein equations , however , even in this case the electromagnetic field ( with non - zero charges ) satisfies the maxwell equations and it is thus a valid test electromagnetic field on the given vacuum background .",
    "now , we can easily identify the plebaski ",
    "demiaski @xmath89 and @xmath71 with our general metric and field using the dictionary @xmath90 clearly , if the charges @xmath87 are missing in the metric functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , these functions corresponds exactly to @xmath93 and @xmath94 given by and the electromagnetic field corresponds to the test field given by .",
    "however , it is possible to modify @xmath92 and @xmath91 by adding @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively ( i.e. , changing the vacuum @xmath0 s by adding @xmath97 ) , and we obtain the metric and the electromagnetic field satisfying the coupled einstein  maxwell equations .      in a generic dimension",
    "we first evaluate the stress - energy tensor @xmath79 of the electromagnetic field .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath99 with the trace @xmath100 where the function @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102 we explicitly see that the trace of the stress - energy is non - vanishing for @xmath98 which is related to the fact that the electromagnetic field is not conformally invariant in a general dimension .",
    "now we would like to solve the einstein equations @xmath103 .",
    "the trace gives the condition @xmath104 however , the scalar curvature has the form and it immediately follows that @xmath105}\\commae\\ ] ] which is a function of @xmath5 only . applying this to the right - hand - side of we obtain the condition @xmath106 it was checked by _ mathematica _ that this conditions does not hold for the electromagnetic field given by , at least for the lowest non - trivial values of @xmath22 .",
    "it seems that the main problem is that @xmath107 behaves as @xmath108 while @xmath101 as a square of such sums .",
    "we thus may conclude that in a generic even dimension the electromagnetic field of the form , can not couple to the metric given by .",
    "let us briefly review modifications which appear in the odd dimensional case .",

    "could be eliminated by a appropriate rescaling of the coordinates and other parameters . ]",

    "we have found explicitly the test electromagnetic field on the background of the high - dimensional rotating nut charged black hole @xcite .",
    "the field solves the maxwell equations even in a broader class of spacetimes since the specific form of the metric functions @xmath0 is not needed .",
    "the common feature of these spacetimes is the presence of @xmath149 killing vectors and the existence of the principal killing  yano tensor @xcite .",
