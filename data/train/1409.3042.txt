    "normal form theory provides a powerful tool for studying local dynamics near equilibria .",
    "the normal form theory uses coordinate changes in order to represent equations in the simplest possible form .",
    "the normal form often possesses additional symmetries which are not present in the original system . for a hamiltonian system",
    "a continuous family of symmetries implies existence of an additional integral of motion due to noether theorem . in the case of two degrees of freedom ,",
    "an additional integral of motion makes the dynamics integrable . in this way",
    "the normal form theory looses information on non - integrable chaotic dynamics possibly present in the original system .",
    "the accuracy of the normal form theory depends on the smoothness of the original vector field and , in the analytic theory , the error becomes smaller than any order of a small parameter and in some cases an exponentially small upper bound can be established .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate this situation considering a classical generic bifurcation of an equilibrium in an one parameter analytic family of hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let us describe our set up in more details .",
    "let @xmath0 be a real - analytic family of hamiltonian functions defined in a neighbourhood of the origin in @xmath1 endowed with the canonical symplectic form @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics are defined via the canonical system of hamiltonian differential equations @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding flow preserves the hamiltonian @xmath5 and symplectic form @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to write down the hamiltonian equations in the vector form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the standard symplectic matrix and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that for @xmath10 the origin is an equilibrium of the hamiltonian system with a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues @xmath11 and a double zero one @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , we assume that @xmath13 and the hessian matrix @xmath14 is already transformed to the diagonal form @xmath15 , which can be achieved by a linear canonical transformation provided @xmath16 is not semi - simple .",
    "then for any integer @xmath17 there is an analytic canonical change of variables which transforms the hamiltonian to the following form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is polynomial in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the remainder term @xmath23 has a taylor expansion which starts with terms of order @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath24 . in the analytic case , this remainder can be made even exponentially small @xcite .",
    "our assumptions imply that @xmath25 then the lower order terms of @xmath26 have the form @xmath27 where we have explicitly written down all quadratic and some of the cubic terms . in a generic family @xmath28 . without loosing in generality and for greater convenience",
    "we assume @xmath29 .    since the remainder term in ( [ eq : mainh ] ) is small , it is natural to make a comparison with the dynamics of the normal form described by the truncated hamiltonian function @xmath30 obviously , the poisson bracket @xmath31 and consequently @xmath32 is an integral of motion for the normal form . for every fixed @xmath32 equation ( [ eq : hamnf ] )",
    "represents a natural hamiltonian system in a neighbourhood of the origin on the @xmath33-plane . depending on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath32 , the potential @xmath26 takes one of three shapes shown on figure  [ fig : vmu ] .     and",
    "@xmath32,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    and @xmath32,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    and @xmath32,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] + ( a)4.9 cm ( b)4.9 cm ( c )     respectively , the equation @xmath34 has either none , one or two solutions located in a small neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "these solutions correspond either to a periodic orbit ( if @xmath35 ) or to an equilibrium ( if @xmath36 ) of the normal form .",
    "we note that for @xmath36 figure  [ fig : vmu ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) correspond respectively to @xmath37 , @xmath10 and @xmath38 .",
    "when the potential has the shape of figure  [ fig : vmu ]  ( c ) the corresponding hamiltonian system has a separatrix loop similar to the one shown on figure  [ fig : loop ] .",
    "-plane , width=151,height=75 ]    this separatrix loop looks similar to the separatrix of the equation defined by the hamiltonian @xmath39 the situation can be summarised in the following way .",
    "the plane @xmath36 is invariant for the normal form hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "the restriction of the normal form hamiltonian onto this plane defines a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom .",
    "as @xmath22 crosses the zero , a pair of equilibria is created on this plane , one saddle point and one elliptic one .",
    "the normal form system has a separatrix solution which converges to the saddle equilibrium both at @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "trajectories located inside this separatrix loop are periodic .",
    "all other trajectories escape from a small neighbourhood of the origin and their behaviour can not be studied using only the local normal form theory presented here .",
    "the remainder term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : mainh ] ) breaks the symmetry of the normal form and it is expected that in general the full equations do not possess neither an additional integral nor an invariant plane @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , a part of the normal form dynamics survives .",
    "in particular , for @xmath38 the hamiltonian system @xmath5 has a saddle - centre equilibrium @xmath43 with eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is close to @xmath47 and @xmath48 is of order of @xmath49 .",
    "there are 4 solutions ( separatrices ) of the hamiltonian system which are asymptotic to this equilibrium .",
    "these solutions converge to @xmath43 as @xmath41 or @xmath42 and are tangent asymptotically as @xmath50 to eigenvectors of @xmath51 , which correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath44 respectively .",
    "two of these separatrices are close to the separatrix loop of the normal form .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study the difference between these separatrices .",
    "our main theorem implies that the unstable solutions returns to a small neighbourhood of @xmath43 but , in general , misses the stable direction by a quantity which is exponentially small compared to @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , the system ( [ eq : mainh ] ) generically does not have a single - round homoclinic orbit for all sufficiently small @xmath38 .",
    "we also point out that our main theorem implies existence of homoclinic trajectories for lyapunov periodic orbits located on the central manifold exponentially close to the saddle - centre equilibrium ( compare with similar statements for reversible systems in @xcite and with the recent preprint @xcite ) .",
    "the dimension arguments @xcite show that the existence of a single - round homoclinic orbit to a saddle - centre equilibrium of a vector field in @xmath1 is expected to be a phenomenon of co - dimension between one and three depending on the presence ( or absence ) of hamiltonian structure and reversible symmetries .",
    "in particular , the codimension one corresponds to a symmetric homoclinic orbit for a symmetric equilibrium in a reversible hamiltonian system , and the codimension three corresponds to a non - symmetric homoclinic orbit to a symmetric equilibrium in a reversible non - hamiltonian system . treating @xmath52 and @xmath53 as independent parameters , champneys @xcite provided an example of a reversible vector field where lines of homoclinic points bifurcate from @xmath54 on the plane of  @xmath55 .",
    "the splitting of the one - round separatrix loop does not prevent existence of  multi - round \" homoclinics , i.e. , homoclinic orbits which make several rounds close to the separatrix of the normal form before converging to the equilibrium .",
    "generically , if the system is both hamiltonian and reversible , we expect the existence of reversible multi - round homoclinics for a sequence of values of the parameter @xmath22 which converges to @xmath56 .",
    "the study of these phenomena is beyond the goals of this paper .",
    "since in the limit @xmath57 the separatrix loop disappears and the ratio @xmath58 , the problem of the separatrix splitting near the bifurcation can be attributed to the class of singularly perturbed systems characterised by the presence of two different time - scales , similar to the problems considered in @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of a singularly perturbed problem is related to the exponential smallness of the separatrix splitting in the parameter @xmath22 which requires development of specially adapted perturbation methods ( see for example @xcite and references in the review @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulties related to the exponential smallness do not appear in problems of the regular perturbation theory .",
    "at the same time dynamics of such systems share many qualitative properties with the singularly perturbed case .    if a reversible hamiltonian system has a symmetric separatrix loop associated with a symmetric saddle - center equilibrium , then its one - parameter reversible hamiltonian unfolding has multi - round homoclinic orbits for a set of parameter values which accumulate at the critical one  @xcite .",
    "a generic two parameter unfolding of a hamiltonian system which has a homoclinic orbit to a saddle - centre equilibrium was studies in @xcite , where countable sets of parameter values for which 2-round ( and multi - round ) loops are found .",
    "the splitting of the separatrix loop has important consequences for the dynamics .",
    "the problem of constructing a complete description of the dynamics in a neighbourhood of a homoclinic loop to a saddle - centre was stated and partially solved in @xcite .",
    "later this result was extended and improved in @xcite .",
    "these papers do not directly cover the situation described in this paper ( see @xcite for a discussion of relations between these two classes in the hamiltonian context ) .",
    "the main difference is related to the exponential smallness of the separatrix splitting in the bifurcation problem discussed in the present paper .",
    "the presence of exponentially small phenomena hidden beyond all orders of the normal form theory is also observed in other bifurcation problems ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the problem of existence of small amplitude single- and multi - round homoclinic orbits arises in various applications .",
    "these applications include dynamics of the three - body - problem near @xmath59 libration point @xcite .",
    "homoclinic solutions also appear in the study of traveling wave or steady - state reductions of partial differential equations on the real line which model various phenomena in mechanics , fluids and optics ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "these solutions are of particular interest as they represent localized modes or solitary waves , these problems are often of the singular perturbed nature  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath43 be an equilibrium of the hamiltonian system with eigenvalues @xmath60 . then for each @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is a positive constant ) there is an analytic change of variables such that the equilibrium is shifted to the origin and the hamiltonian function is transformed to its birkhoff normal form which can be presented in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an analytic function of two variables @xmath65 a statement equivalent to the convergence of the normal form was originally obtained in @xcite . of course , since @xmath66 as @xmath57 , the size of domains of convergence shrinks to zero both for the normal form and for the normalising transformation .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to refine the estimates of @xcite in order to establish that the sizes of the domains are sufficiently large to be used in the following arguments .",
    "obviously @xmath67 and , consequently , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constant along trajectories of the hamiltonian system .",
    "both functions are local integrals only and in general do not have a single - valued extension onto the phase space .",
    "the transformation which transforms the original hamiltonian to the normal form is not unique .",
    "nevertheless the values of @xmath68 and @xmath70 are unique as they do not depend on this freedom .",
    "as the eigenvalues of the equilibrium are preserved , the taylor expansion of the transformed hamiltonian has the form @xmath71 the structure of the phase space in a neighbourhood of the origin is illustrated by figure  [ fig : sc ] where @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , in the normal form coordinates points with @xmath73 correspond to lyapunoff periodic orbits .    a trajectory which converges to @xmath43 as @xmath42 or @xmath74 without leaving the domain of the normal form has @xmath75 .",
    "in the normal form coordinates all these trajectories are easy to find explicitly .",
    "let @xmath76 be separatrix solutions of the hamiltonian system ( [ eq : mainh ] ) which converge to the equilibrium @xmath77 being close to the separatrix loop described in the introduction .",
    "since @xmath78 are solutions of an autonomous ode , these assumptions define the functions @xmath76 up to a translation in time @xmath79 .",
    "we will eliminate this freedom later . at the moment it is sufficient to note that @xmath80 will be chosen to be in a small neighbourhood of the intersection of the normal form separatrix with the plane @xmath81 .",
    "note that the curve @xmath78 may have more than one intersection with @xmath82 , in this case we chose a ",
    "primary \" one .",
    "the unstable separatrix @xmath83 leaves the domain of the normal form , makes a round trip near the ghost separatrix loop , and at a later moment of time comes back close to the stable direction of the hamiltonian vector field at @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath84 and @xmath85 be the values of the elliptic and hyperbolic energies obtained after this round - trip .",
    "conservation of the energy implies that @xmath86 , so the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are not independent .",
    "traditionally the elliptic energy @xmath84 is used to measure the separatrix splitting . in particular , if @xmath87 , then the trajectory is homoclinic .",
    "if @xmath88 , the trajectory will eventually leave the neighbourhood of @xmath43 for the second time .",
    "there is a sequence of real constants @xmath89 such that @xmath90 the coefficient @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a complex constant defined by the hamiltonian @xmath93 via equation  ( [ eq : a0 ] ) and @xmath94 are defined by  ( [ eq : an ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : mainasymp ] ) implies that @xmath84 is exponentially small compared to @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath97 this theorem implies the splitting of the separatrix and , hence , non - existence of a single - loop homoclinic orbit .",
    "we do not know an explicit formula to compute @xmath92 . nevertheless , numerical methods of @xcite can be adapted for evaluating the constants in the asymptotic series with arbitrary precision .",
    "the arguments presented in section  [ se : melnikov ] can be used to prove that @xmath92 is generically non - vanishing ( as the map @xmath98 is a non - trivial analytic ( non - linear ) functional ) .",
    "indeed , if the hamiltonian @xmath5 analytically depends on an additional parameter @xmath99 , then it can be proved that @xmath100 is analytic . then the melnikov method can be used to show that @xmath101 for values of @xmath99 which correspond to an integrable hamiltonian .",
    "finally the analyticity implies that zeroes of @xmath102 are isolated and , consequently , the coefficient does not vanish for a generic hamiltonian @xmath93 .",
    "the proof of the main theorem is based on ideas proposed by v. lazutkin in 1984 for studying separatrix splitting for the standard map and later used in @xcite for studying separatrix splitting of a rapidly forced pendulum .",
    "this paper contains a sketch of the proof for the main theorem .",
    "the melnikov method is often used to study the splitting of separatrices . in general the melnikov method",
    "does not produce a correct estimate for the problem discussed in this paper .",
    "section [ se : melnikov ] contains a discussion of the applicability of the melnikov method .",
    "as a first step of the proof we provide a description of the elliptic energy @xmath84 in terms of the splitting vector @xmath103 which describes the difference between the stable and unstable separatrix solution , and a solution of a variational equation around @xmath104 .",
    "this description allows us to compute @xmath105 without explicit usage of a transformation to the normal form in a neighbourhood of the saddle - centre equilibrium .    in the normal form coordinates the hamiltonian is described by equation ( [ eq : hamnfl ] ) , thus the corresponding equations of motion take the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "since on the local stable trajectory @xmath109 , equation  ( [ eq : quadr ] ) implies that @xmath110 , and we can find this trajectory explicitly : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant .",

    "the first two solutions are mutually complex conjugate , so real - analytic solutions can be easily constructed when needed .",
    "a direct computation shows that @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "for all other pairs @xmath120 the symplectic form @xmath121 vanishes .",
    "later we will study those solutions for non - real values of @xmath79 .",
    "so it is interesting to note that the function @xmath122 exponentially grows in the complex upper half - plane @xmath123 , while @xmath124 exponentially decays there .    for each fixed value of @xmath79 we can consider the collection of vectors @xmath125 , @xmath126 , as a basis in @xmath127",
    "then the function @xmath128 provides the @xmath129-component of the splitting vector @xmath130 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : varnf ] ) and ( [ eq : xplusnf ] ) imply that @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are components of @xmath134 in the normal form coordinates ( for the values of @xmath79 corresponding to the first return of the unstable trajectory to the small neighbourhood of the saddle - centre @xmath43 ) . taking into account that @xmath134 is real - analytic and using the definition of @xmath84 of ( [ eq : eeeh ] )",
    ", we obtain that the equality @xmath135 holds for real values of @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath84 is a local integral , @xmath136 also stays constant for real @xmath79 while the unstable solution remains inside the domain of the normal form .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : eellip ] ) provides a relation between @xmath84 and @xmath137 .",
    "while @xmath84 is defined using the normal form coordinates , the function @xmath137 is defined by ( [ eq : ttheta ] ) and can be evaluated in other canonical systems of coordinates .",
    "this computation relies on accurate analysis of the way the splitting vector @xmath138 and the solutions of the variational equation @xmath139 are transformed under coordinate changes .",
    "it is important to note that although canonical coordinate changes do preserve the symplectic form , @xmath140 does not take the same value when evaluated in a different coordinate system but can differ by a value of the order of @xmath141 .    slightly overloading the notation ,",
    "let @xmath138 and @xmath139 be respectively the splitting vector and the solutions of the variational equation written in the original coordinates .",
    "the splitting vector is defined by equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "the solutions @xmath139 can be fixed by asymptotic conditions described in the next section to ensure that they represent the same solutions of the variational equation as in ( [ eq : ttheta ] ) but expressed in the other coordinates .",
    "then we define a function in a way similar to ( [ eq : ttheta ] ) @xmath142 it is easy to check that @xmath143 , where the constant @xmath144 bounds the @xmath145-norm of the transformation between the systems of coordinates . for the real @xmath79 , the function @xmath124 is uniformly bounded and we conclude that @xmath146 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath147",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : eellip ] ) implies that @xmath148 a refinement of the arguments from @xcite implies that @xmath149 .",
    "this factor does not break the approximation as @xmath150 is of the same order as @xmath151 and @xmath151 is exponentially small compared to @xmath22 .",
    "we will use the equation ( [ eq : eellipgen ] ) to obtain an estimate for @xmath84 .",
    "on the next step of the proof we study solutions of the variational equation near the unstable separatrix solution @xmath152 : @xmath153 this is a linear homogeneous non - autonomous equation .",
    "since the variational equation comes from a hamiltonian system , it is easy to check that for any two solutions @xmath154 and @xmath155 of equation ( [ eq : mainvareq ] ) the value of the symplectic form @xmath156 is independent of @xmath79 .",
    "this property together with asymptotic behaviour of solutions at @xmath42 are used to select a fundamental system of solutions .",
    "let @xmath157 be an eigenvector of the linearised hamiltonian vector field at @xmath43 , @xmath158 such that @xmath159 .",
    "note that the complex conjugate vector @xmath160 is also an eigenvector , but it corresponds to the complex conjugate eigenvalue @xmath161 .",
    "let @xmath162 with @xmath163 being vectors with real components .",
    "then our normalisation condition is equivalent to @xmath164 .",
    "the vector @xmath165 is defined uniquely up to multiplication by a complex constant of unit absolute value , in other words , for any real @xmath166 the vector @xmath167 also satisfies our normalisation assumption .",
    "we assume that this freedom is eliminated in the same way as in the linear part of the normal form theory near the saddle - centre .",
    "in particular , @xmath168 is a smooth function of @xmath169 ( including the limit @xmath57 ) .",
    "now we are ready to define fundamental solutions of the variational equation .",
    "one solution is selected by the assumption @xmath170 for @xmath42 .",
    "the other one is defined using the real symmetry : @xmath171 these two solutions are not real on the real axis and @xmath172 .",
    "sometimes it is useful to consider their linear combinations @xmath173 which are real - analytic .",
    "the third solution is given by @xmath174 the last solution is chosen to satisfy the following normalisation conditions : @xmath175 we note that since the original system is hamiltonian , for any two functions @xmath176 and @xmath177 which satisfy the variational equation , @xmath178 is independent of @xmath79 .",
    "consequently the vectors @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 form a standard symplectic basis for every  @xmath79 : @xmath183 then we can write the splitting vector in this basis : @xmath184 the normalisation condition ( [ eq : normsymp ] ) implies that @xmath185 for the future use we also define @xmath186 which involve the non - real solutions of the variational equation .",
    "the real symmetry implies that @xmath187 .",
    "we note that in general the coefficients @xmath188 depend on time .",
    "indeed , the equation ( [ eq : mainhameq ] ) implies that @xmath189 where @xmath190 is a remainder of a taylor series . then differentiating the definition of @xmath188 with respect to @xmath79 and taking into account that @xmath191 is a symplectic matrix we get @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the index of the canonically conjugate variable ( e.g. @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) .",
    "so @xmath188 are @xmath196-close to being constant .",
    "moreover , @xmath197 are much smaller than @xmath150 and @xmath198 . indeed , taking into account the definition of @xmath199 we get @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the differential of @xmath5 at the point @xmath202 .",
    "since @xmath203 , we conclude that @xmath204 .",
    "initial condition for @xmath80 can be chosen in such a way that @xmath205 ( by translating time in the stable solution in order to achieve the zero projection of @xmath206 on the direction of the hamiltonian vector field at @xmath207 represented by @xmath208 ) .",
    "thus @xmath209 .    taking into account the real symmetry",
    "we see that the problem of the separatrix splitting is reduced to the study of a single complex constant @xmath210 ( via the equation ( [ eq : eellipgen ] ) ) .",
    "the proof of the main theorem requires construction of accurate approximations for the stable and unstable separatrix solutions of the hamiltonian system ( [ eq : mainhameq ] ) as well as the fundamental solutions of the variational equation ( [ eq : mainvareq ] ) . taking into account that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : mainh ] ) can be formally transformed to the integrable normal form ( [ eq : hamnf ] )",
    ", we construct an approximation by finding a formal solution to the systems defined by the normal form hamiltonian .",
    "of course , the series of the normal form theory diverge in general , but they can be shown to provide asymptotic expansions for the true solutions restricted to properly chosen domains on the complex plane of the time variable @xmath79 .      in this section",
    "we find a formal separatrix for the normal form hamiltonian @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a formal series in three variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 with the lower order terms given by ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",

    "formal expansions can be substantially simplified with the help of an auxiliary small parameter  @xmath215 .",
    "so instead of performing expansion directly in powers of @xmath22 , we look for a solution of the system ( [ eq : formalhameq ] ) considering @xmath216 @xmath217 and @xmath22 as formal power series in @xmath215 .",
