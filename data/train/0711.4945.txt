    "the determination of the electric microfield distribution at a neutral atom or charged impurity ion ( radiator ) in a plasma is an important tool for the understanding of many spectroscopic experiments @xcite . since the pioneering work of holtsmark @xcite , who completely neglected correlations between the particles ( ideal plasma ) ,",
    "many efforts have been concentrated on an improved statistical description of the microfield distribution . the first theory which goes beyond the holtsmark limit and which is based on a cluster expansion similar to that of ursell and mayer @xcite was developed by baranger and mozer @xcite . in this approach",
    "the microfield distribution is represented as an expansion in terms of correlation functions which has been truncated on the level of the pair correlation .",
    "the latter is treated in the debye - hckel form which corresponds to the first order of the expansion in the coupling parameter .",
    "the theory by baranger and mozer was improved by hooper @xcite .",
    "they reformulated the expansion of the microfield distribution in terms of other functions by introducing a free parameter which was adjusted in such a way to arrive at a level where the resulting microfield distribution did not depend on the free parameter any more .",
    "however , it was argued that such a method is only valid at small coupling parameters , where the correction to the holtsmark distribution , corresponding to the first term in the series , is small .",
    "the first theory capable to provide reliable numerical results for strongly coupled plasmas , known as adjustable - parameter exponential approximation ( apex ) , was proposed by iglesias and co - workers igl83,ala84 .",
    "it involves a noninteracting quasiparticle representation of the electron - screened ions .",
    "this phenomenological but highly successful approximation is based on a parameterization of the electric microfield produced on a radiator with the debye - hckel - type screened interaction with unknown screening length .",
    "this free parameter is then adjusted in such a way to yield the correct second moment of the microfield distribution . afterwards",
    "the apex model was substantially improved for neutral radiators using renormalized correlation functions and electric fields @xcite .",
    "( we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "most of this work was done on one - component plasmas ( ocp ) and thus neglects the influence of the attractive interactions between electrons and ions . in this paper",
    "we study the microfield distribution in a two - component plasmas ( tcp ) .",
    "this has been done previously in refs .",
    "yan86,ort00 for partially degenerate electrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite the low - frequency component of the microfield was calculated within the linear response treatment taking strong correlations into account via local field corrections .",
    "also the problem of attractive interaction has been considered for a single but highly charged impurity ion immersed in an electronic ocp @xcite . in the recent papers",
    "@xcite we already studied strongly coupled systems , i.e. , a highly charged radiator in a tcp of classical ( nondegenerated ) and strongly correlated particles beyond a perturbative treatment .",

    "@xcite is based on the potential - of - mean - force approximation .",
    "it exactly satisfies the sum - rule requirement arising from the second moment of the microfield distribution without introducing adjustable parameters .",
    "comparisons of the pmfex calculations with the molecular - dynamics simulations for the electric fields at the highly charged points relevant for laser - produced plasmas show , in general , an excellent agreement even for large coupling @xcite . however , the results of the pmfex for neutral points have not yet been comprehensively tested . here",
    ", the pmfex scheme may be less accurate @xcite , similar as it occurs in the apex where further improvement for microfield distribution at neutral point is needed , see ref .",
    "moreover , in a regime dominated by small local fields and hence by small local electronic density the pmfex deviates from the molecular - dynamics simulations also for charged radiator @xcite .",
    "this feature has been clearly observed for a single ion embedded in an electronic ocp in ref .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to improve the pmfex model and provide a tool for calculating the corrections to it when required .",
    "our purpose here is to introduce the key ideas of pmfex in the standard baranger - mozer cluster representation for the microfield distributions @xcite . in this way",
    "some contact between pmfex and standard small plasma - parameter theories is established , while also providing pmfex as the leading term in a series from which corrections can be calculated explicitly .",
    "another important ingredient of our treatment is the electron - ion attractive interaction which drastically changes the physical properties of the system as compared to classical ocps ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "but the thermodynamic stability of a tcp requires at least some quantum features for the electron - ion interaction at short distances .",
    "this required minimum of quantum features is here taken into account by using a regularized ion - electron potential mor59,kel63,deu81 , which then enables the application of classical statistical mechanics and classical md simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
