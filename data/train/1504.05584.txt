    "the field of time domain astronomy has recently exploded with the detection of many new classes of transient sources .",
    "considerable progess has so far been made at optical wavelengths with the advent of a host of new programs designed to search for sources at a variety of cadences .",
    "they are also more sensitive to finding sources at different luminosities in the gap between that of novae and traditional supernovae @xcite .",
    "some of the best - known current transient surveys are at optical wavelengths : the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the public european southern observatory spectroscopic survey for transient objects ( pessto ; * ? ? ?",
    "new observatories ( e.g. the large synoptic survey telescope ) , including some at other wavelengths ( e.g. the square kilometer array , erosita ) , are being planned as well .",
    "these observatories enable us to better map out the parameter space of known transients as well as discover new classes of transients .",
    "one of the recently discovered classes is `` calcium - rich gap transients ''  so called because their spectra contain strong forbidden and permitted calcium lines , and they have peak absolute magnitudes in the gap between classical novae and supernovae .",
    "these transients have a set of observational characteristics which distinguish them from other classes of optical transients .",
    "these properties are summarized well by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k12 ) :    * similar to type i supernovae , showing no hydrogen lines in their spectra * absolute magnitudes in the range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( a factor of about 10    30 fainter than the type  ia supernovae , which have @xmath2 of about @xmath3 ) * characteristic velocities of approximately 6000",
    "  11000  km  s@xmath4 * very large calcium abundances , as inferred from their nebular spectra * faster evolution than average type ia supernovae with a rise time @xmath5  days , whereas type  ia have rise times @xmath6  days ( though it is within the full range of type  ia rise times found ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) * current , small sample favors the outskirts of known galaxies    as such , many of the properties of these objects are intermediate between those of classical novae and type  ia supernovae .    previous studies of calcium - rich gap transients have used the common relations for type  ia supernovae to estimate some basic parameters of the explosion . estimate the masses of the ejecta by setting the ejecta mass proportional to @xmath7 ( @xmath8photospheric velocity , @xmath9rise time ) , as first suggested by @xcite , and scaling to type  ia supernovae .",
    "this yields typical total masses of @xmath10    0.7  m@xmath11 , where the fraction of @xmath12ni produced is very small ( e.g. 0.016  m@xmath11 for ptf  10iuv ) .",
    "however , @xcite s modelling explicity requires that there be substantial @xmath12ni in the supernova ejecta , and modelling of the nebular spectrum of sn  2005e in gives a mass about half as large as the @xcite formula does .",
    "type  ia supernovae are predominantly powered by radioactive decay of iron - peak elements , where the amount of nickel produced would be large and the amount of calcium produced would be small ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the modelling falls short in properly describing the explosion .",
    "various models exist to explain the unusual characteristics of these transients , many of which are summarized in .",
    "many of them have at least one serious flaw that makes them unable to explain these transients . to explain the calcium - rich gap transient , sn  2005e , @xcite concluded that they were witnessing helium detonation in an interacting double white dwarf ( wd ) system with a helium wd mass donor @xcite , but the light curve is not well - matched .",
    "various channels for the detonation of sub - chandrasekhar - mass wds exist @xcite , but such models do not provide a good match to the observed light curves .",
    "accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a rapidly rotating white dwarf into a neutron star @xcite is also ruled out based on the predicted shape of the light curves , as well as the large velocities and abundances of intermediate elements predicted .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a one dimensional nuclear - dominated thick accretion flow ( nudaf ) model resulting from the unstable mass transfer following roche lobe overflow , but it does not produce the right amount of helium and calcium to match many of these transients . some of the difficulty in finding a  best - fit \" model may arise in the heterogeneous nature of the current sample : there may be selection bias in finding these transients far from their host galaxies , a range of velocity widths in the lines in the nebular spectra , different light curve evolutions , for examples .    in @xcite ,",
    "another scenario is mentioned : the tidal disruption of a wd by a neutron star or black hole ( bh ) leading to a nuclear runaway ( detonation ) . however",
    ", this scenario is not discussed further .",
    "some other work has considered the tidal disruption of a wd in other contexts but without connection to calcium - rich gap transients . @xcite",
    "considered the emission spectrum after the disruption but not detonation of a wd by a bh ; the spectrum is incomplete because they did not consider the fusion of heavy elements in the tidal debris ( considered only mass fractions of 67% oxygen , 32% carbon , and 1% helium ) . while investigating the vertical compression of tidally disrupted debris",
    ", @xcite noted the possible importance of wd tidal disruptions to gravitational wave signals .",
    "finally , @xcite proposed that a highly unusual combination of a gamma ray burst and a supernova explosion could be explained by a wd tidal disruption .    in this work",
    "we consider the tidal disruption leading to nuclear runaway ( detonation ) of wds in more detail to explain the calcium - rich gap transients .",
    "the goal of the paper is mainly to discuss the _ plausibility _ of this scenario in connection to calcium - rich gap transients , something that has not yet been done in the literature .",
    "future more detailed analyses of this scenario in the context of ca - rich gap transients will need to be undertaken when better multiwavelength ( especially high - energy ) observations become available .",
    "these are needed to solve some of the large uncertainties and degeneracies in various model parameters discussed throughout the text .    in section  [ section : origin ]",
    ", we describe the model and how it can explain various observational characteristics : masses , abundances , light curves , and the positions of these sources .",
    "then in section  [ section : scenarios ] , we discuss some possible scenarios that could produce the tidal detonation and calculate expected rates of these transients to verify if the proposed origin is plausible . in section  [ section : sn2012hn ] , we then analyze a _",
    "observation of one of these transients , which enables us to place upper limits on the masses of the wd and bh in the progenitor system . finally in section  [ section : summary",
    "] , we summarize our results and suggest observational tests of our model .",
    "we propose that the model developed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter r09 ) naturally explains the set of calcium - rich gap transients .",
    "r09 use a three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) method to simulate the close interaction between a wd and a more compact object ( a bh ) that completely disrupts the wd .",
    "when a wd passes too close to a bh ( within the roche or tidal disruption radius ) , the differential gravitational force from the bh will overcome the gravitational force of the wd .",
    "this tidal force can elongate the wd in the orbital direction and compress the wd in the direction perpendicular to the orbit to a high - enough density and pressure to initiate runaway nuclear burning .",
    "if the nuclear energy is greater than the binding energy of the star , an explosive nuclear detonation occurs , producing a luminous transient event .    the tidal disruption leading to the possible detonation of a wd will only occur when @xmath13",
    "m@xmath11 or stellar- or intermediate - mass bhs , ( imbhs ; see r09 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "r09 consider 100  m@xmath14  m@xmath11 , but bhs at a larger range of masses ( up to @xmath15  m@xmath11 or @xmath16  m@xmath11 ) or even neutron stars may be viable detonators as well .",
    "next , we discuss how each of a set of testable theoretical predictions of this model can be explained by current observations of this group of transients .",
    "there already exist a set of strong theoretical and observational ways to constrain the mass of the detonated wd in this scenario .",
    "we first explore the upper limit to the mass of the wd , which is most strongly motivated by the abundance patterns in the nebular spectra .",
    "as implied by the name , these calcium - rich gap transients produce a relatively large amount of calcium .",
    "however , they do not produce a large amount of iron - peak elements ( see the spectra in ) .",
    "this is only well - matched to the tidal detonation scenario if @xmath17  m@xmath11 .",
    "as present the most realistic description of a tidal detonation of a wd to date , this is currently the best estimate of reaction rates in this scenario .",
    "however , there are some important limitations to this work .",
    "the upper limit to the wd mass is not very precise because the wd mass grids presented in are very coarse and might be a function of other parameters ( e.g. tidal radius relative to pericenter , bh mass ) . in addition , the exact boundary of the upper limit is also not well - determined because the nucleosynthesis calculations presented in are based on a simplified nuclear reaction network .",
    "this latter point is particularly important because this implies one can not make specific abundance predictions from this model .",
    "for instance , silicon is taken to represent all the elements within the quasi - equilibrium group near silicon in this network .",
    "therefore , given that calcium lies within this group , as does scandium , it should not be a surprise that large amounts of calcium are not specifically predicted .",
    "the tentative detection of strontium in one calcium - rich transient @xcite would potentially present a problem , as strontium can not be produced in this scenario , but it should be noted that this detection is of marginal significance and only has been seen in one object .",
    "a clear prediction of this picture is that , as a sample of events with well - measured abundances emerges , progressively higher ratios of the iron - peak elements to the elements near silicon in atomic number will be seen as the peak luminosities rise .",
    "however , since we expect a range of impact parameters for the tidal detonation model , future work may require a very large sample size to discern these trends .",
    "in addition to the abundance analysis , which requires that @xmath18  m@xmath11 , the density - dependent roche limit may favor the tidal disruption of lower - mass wds .",
    "lower - mass wds have lower densities ( @xmath19 ) because they are larger .",
    "because the minimum distance at which an object is disrupted by tidal forces scales as @xmath20 , this may imply that lower - mass wds are more susceptible to stretching and compression , possibly making them easier to detonate . however , based on the limited number of grids in , it is not clear whether this susceptibility outweighs other effects ( e.g. needing to reach a critical density to detonate , which would require more compression ) ; more work on this topic is clearly needed .",
    "if this is true , then this would imply that the lowest - mass wds are be preferred in this scenario .",
    "this is a problem for single star evolution , as it only produces wds with @xmath21  m@xmath11 for the lowest - mass evolved stars in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , binary processes can produce lower - mass systems ( common envelope evolution and roche lobe overflow ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and account for the low - mass wds found in the last couple decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lowest - mass wds yet found are commonly referred to as extremely low mass ( elm ) wds @xmath22  m@xmath11 and are helium - dominated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "putting these constraints together , we conclude that @xmath23  m@xmath24m@xmath11 .",
    "absorption lines in type  ia sne tend to become narrower with time , as the outer layers become more diluted by the expansion of the ejecta and the line - forming region recedes to lower velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite observe the opposite trend in one of the calcium - rich gap transients , sn  2012hn : constant photospheric velocity ( as inferred from the blueshift of absorption lines ) and increasing linewidths , which are better explained by a continuing energy source .    in supernovae ,",
    "the radiative decay of nickel serves as a continuing source of energy after the original ejection of material in the explosion .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , iron - peak elements are not appreciably seen for calcium - rich gap transients nor would we expect them in this scenario . find that , in the low - mass wds ( @xmath22  m@xmath11 ) , only about 0.03  m@xmath11 of iron - peak elements are likely to be produced in the explosion , and the detonated 0.6  m@xmath11 model produces an abundance of iron - peak elements @xmath25 less than the detonated 1.2  m@xmath11 models .    instead , the power source can be naturally explained by fall - back accretion of a fraction of the wd material onto the bh .",
    "the very hot inflow of gas ( a few tens to hundreds of million k ) not only produces an optical flare but also produces copius x - ray emission .",
    "the highly blueshifted and broadened lines ( up to thousands of km  s@xmath4 ) can be explained by motions of material associated with the accretion flow , as seen for both stellar and supermassive bhs ( e.g. disk winds ; * ? ? ?",

    "for instance , show that for the detonation of a 0.2  m@xmath11 wd by a 1000  m@xmath11 bh , the accretion rate onto the central bh will initially be very large ( @xmath26  m@xmath11  s@xmath4 ) for the first approximately 10  min and then decay as @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "detailed modelling of the optical light curve using type  ia templates has been challenging for all previous work and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison of the slope of late - time r - band light curve ( @xmath28    100 days after the peak ) of a few of the calcium - rich gap transients with well - sampled light curves ( e.g. sn 2005e , ptf  10iuv ) indicates that the tidal detonation scenario ( @xmath29 ) seems to provide a better match than the exponential radioactive decay of @xmath12ni as done in , even when taking into account more of the decay chain ( @xmath12co and the kinetic energy loss from its @xmath30 decay ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another more more complicated possibility is that the optical light curves could be explained by the decay of lower - mass elements ( @xmath31cr @xmath32v @xmath32ti and @xmath33ti @xmath34sc @xmath34ca ) , producing late - time emission @xcite .    later on , when the accretion rate falls below the eddington rate onto this bh , @xmath35  m@xmath11 )  erg  s@xmath4 or @xmath36  m@xmath37  m@xmath11  yr@xmath4 ( standard radiative efficiency 0.1 assumed ;",

    "however , the exact brightness and evolution of the x - ray bright phase depends a number of poorly constrained parameters : the wd s initial mass and trajectory , the mass of the bh , and the structure of the initially super - eddington accretion flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these uncertainties make the viscous dissipation timescale uncertain by many orders of magnitude .",

    "we provide a detailed discussion of random encounter rates and possible three - body interaction scenarios that can satisfy these requirements in section  [ section : scenarios ] .",
    "to discern whether globular clusters and dwarf galaxies will survive long enough to be observable in the local universe , we can apply the roche or tidal disruption limit to these possible host stellar systems .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , likely host systems for these transients are faint dwarf galaxies or globular clusters given our scenario .",
    "precise rate predictions for this scenario can not be calculated at the present time due to considerable uncertainties in multiple key parameters : the fraction of globular clusters and faint dwarf galaxies which contain intermediate- or stellar - mass bhs , the masses of those bhs , the masses of the wds that might be detonated , the structural parameters ( and hence central stellar densities ) of the clusters and/or faint dwarf galaxies which contain those bhs , etc .",
    "we only consider rough estimates to test if this model is plausible or not .",
    "a thorough analysis is well beyond the scope of this paper and is very challenging because it would have to be quite complex , taking into account ( not an exhaustive list ) : the binary fraction around the primary bh , general relativistic corrections , stellar densities , the replenishment rate of the loss cone of the bh , the spin of the bh , the mass ratio of the bh in the case of a binary , etc . , while having good observational constraints for the relevant parameters .",
    "we consider two basic plausible scenarios in which a wd could get close enough to a bh with @xmath54  m@xmath11 to be tidally disrupted : 1 ) the chance flyby of a single wd to an imbh and 2 ) the perturbation of a three - body system , which is especially needed for the stellar - mass bhs with lower interaction cross - sections ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "then we consider how these ideas fit with the locations of these events .",
    "given the larger interaction cross section of an imbh , chance flybys in dense stellar systems could occur often enough to be observable calcium - rich gap transients .",

    "the crude rate calculation can be taken as evidence of plausibility , under the assumption that some non - negligible fraction of globular clusters contain imbhs .    at the present time , the evidence that globular clusters contain imbhs is weak .",

    "we now consider its importance for the tidal disruption of wds when they are paired with a bh and another member ( another star or remnant ) in a triple system .",
    "we consider paths to exchange angular momentum which do and do not involve mass transfer .",
    "first , we consider a few examples of three - body interactions that will exchange angular momentum without mass transfer .",
    "the first two options require the kozai - lidov mechanism and are enhanced in higher - mass - ratio systems .",
    "rapid eccentricity oscillations @xcite can make the magnitude of angular momentum in the inner binary comparable to the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "when numerically evolving the triple system , @xcite find that , because the general relativistic terms are sensitive to the orbital eccentricity , the inner binary can merge well within a few gyr , or even faster if the mass ratio is large because it is proportional to the amplitude of the eccentricity oscillations ; this would be the case for a wd and bh inner binary .",
    "second , a bh binary system in a stellar cusp strongly enhances the rate of tidal disruption over two - body relaxation for a single bh @xcite .",
    "this was originally demonstrated for a supermassive bh and another bh in a binary in the center of a stellar cusp of a galaxy , but also applies to a stellar - mass bh and imbh pair in the center of a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy , which are relevant for calcium - rich gap transients .",
    "the tidal disruption rate in this case is at least approximately an order of magnitude larger than a single imbh fed by two - body relaxation @xcite but it also quickly depletes the loss cone in @xmath74  yr .",
    "yet another way a triple system can cause a wd in the inner binary to migrate toward a bh is through the tidal excitation of high frequency p - modes .",
    "these can redistribute angular momentum in a triple system @xcite , causing the inner binary to inspiral .",
    "finally , the redistribution of angular momentum does not have to occur within a triple star system to significantly perturb a close binary .",
    "a close flyby of another star / remnant or binary can induce a high - enough eccentricity in a wd - bh binary that forces the wd to pass within the tidal disruption radius ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed discussions ) .",
    "finally , we consider two examples which involve mass transfer . in the first of these cases , @xcite",
    "show that the mass transfer / accretion of gas from a dense interstellar medium ( star - forming region ) can act as a way to transfer angular momentum .",
    "when moving through and accreting the dense gas , the orbit can be shrunk by dissipating angular momentum through acoustic waves .",
    "this would require the site of the transient to be near a dense molecular cloud ; however , these transients are not generally associated with star formation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that mass is transferred from star to star within the binary or lost as the stars evolve off of the main sequence @xcite .",
    "this can happen in a much older stellar population and induce a chaotic orbital behavior .",
    "as has just been made clear , there are a multitude of various ways three - body interactions can lead to the tidal disruption of a wd , many of which do not require extremely dense stellar systems ( e.g. the importance of three - body interactions in lower - density stellar groups ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this makes it very difficult if not impossible to rule out the tidal disruption origin on interaction cross - section arguments alone .",
    "and how these limits are calculated is provided in section  [ section : sn2012hn ] .",
    "the horizontal jump that appears on the plot for @xmath75 is the hard / soft - state transition ( the state transition is not crossed on the other plotted curves ) .",
    "the excluded parameter space , where the wd is swallowed whole or the wd produces too many heavy elements , is discussed in section  [ section : sn2012hn ] ( note : the boundaries are approximate ) . ]    to test the proposed origin of the calcium - rich gap transients as tidal disruptions of wds , we observed one of these sources , sn  2012hn @xcite to look for accretion emission during the decay phase .",
    "sn  2012hn has all of the typical characteristics of calcium - rich gap transients as outlined in section  [ section : intro ] .",
    "it is also fairly nearby , at a distance of only 27  mpc , in the outskirts of the galaxy ngc  2272 .",
    "since accretion is observed most unambiguously in the x - rays , we used the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. we observed sn  2012hn with _",
    "chandra _ for a continuous 30  ksec on 17  august  2013 ( obs_id=15668 ) , 533 days after the explosion , which occurred on 12  march  2012 .",
    "data were taken in timed exposure mode and telemetered in very faint mode .",
    "data reduction and analysis were completed using ciao version 4.6 @xcite and sherpa version 2 @xcite .",
    "we reprocessed the level=1 event file using the chandra_repro script to apply the most recent calibration updates available ( caldb version 4.6.1.1 ) .",
    "the source was not detected in the observation . to calculate upper limits to the source flux",
    ", we extracted source and background spectra using specextract at the location of the transient in a @xmath76 radius circle and a @xmath77 radius annulus excluding the source region , respectively .",
    "we jointly fit the unbinned source and background spectra at 0.5    8.0  kev using the c - statistic , which is similar to the @xcite statistic but with an approximate goodness - of - fit measure .",
    "since we constrain @xmath78 for any bh mass we consider , the accretion disk is in the canonical low / hard state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the spectrum is usually well - described by a power - law model . for the source spectral model ( xsphabs @xmath79 xspowerlaw )",
    ", we set the photon index of the power - law , @xmath80 .",
    "this value is typical for accretion in average x - ray binary populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the column density ,",
    "@xmath81 was frozen at the galactic foreground value @xcite .",
    "the background spectrum was fit with a @xmath82 power law , consistent with the hard x - ray background ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we find a @xmath83 upper limit to the unabsorbed flux , @xmath84  erg  @xmath85  s@xmath4 . at a distance of 27",
    "mpc , this corresponds to @xmath86  erg  s@xmath4 .    to put this upper limit in context ,",
    "we adopt the analytical relations from @xcite for the similar case of the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive bh to calculate joint upper limits on the mass of the wd and bh assumed to be involved in the disruption ( given the x - ray luminosity upper limit above at the time of the observation ) . while more complex numerical models exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we opt to use the simpler analytical formulation to derive parameter limits , especially since the source is not x - ray - detected .",
    "first , we combine equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) from @xcite to calculate the fallback accretion rate , @xmath87 , as a function of time , @xmath88 , fallback fraction , @xmath89 , and mass of the bh , @xmath39 .",
    "we then calculate the accretion efficiency , @xmath90 , using equation ( 12 ) from @xcite .",
    "in addition , we make a few more assumptions that simplify or improve our model :    * we use the mass - radius relation for wds , assuming the mean molecular weight per free electron , @xmath91 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their equation 7.103 ) .",
    "* we assume that @xmath92 , as suggested by . *",
    "we take into account the accretion disk state transition of accreting bh binaries so that @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to account for the fraction of light falling in the _ chandra _ bandpass , we assume a bolometric correction , @xmath97 , of 0.85 in the high , soft state and 0.1 in the low , hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to take into account that the various scale factors are jointly uncertain by approximately a factor of a few , we define a relative effective efficiency : @xmath98    we plot the joint upper limits in @xmath39 and @xmath38 for a range in a factor of 3 for @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ fig : upper_limits ] .",
    "the effects for different bh spins , choice of x - ray spectral model and other uncertainties discussed in section  [ section : light_curve ] are also subsumed into the uncertainty in @xmath99 .",
    "the fact that @xmath100 and m@xmath101  m@xmath11 , which excludes large sections of parameter space given the tidal detonation model , are discussed in section  [ section : abundance_mass ] and the beginning of section  [ section : origin ] .    from this analysis ,",
    "we have placed weak constraints on the bh mass .",
    "it is clear that these observations are not deep enough or taken close enough to the time of the transient to place strongly constraining upper limits on the host system under this model .",
    "in this work , we have proposed that tidal detonations of low - mass wds are the source of at least some of the calcium - rich gap transients .",
    "we have shown that the predictions of this model are at least qualitatively consistent with observations of the systems discovered thus far . throughout this work ,",
    "we have assessed this model using rough comparisons to test for plausibility ; however , because of the large range of ways in which the tidal detonation can arise and the large uncertainties in key parameters in these systems , detailed quantiative comparisons are not possible at the present time and currently may not be computationally feasible .    a few clear , testable predictions can be made if this scenario is correct :    1 .   if these transients are random flyby encounters of low - mass wds with imbhs , most of the calcium - rich gap transients should be associated with low - luminosity , preferably dense stellar groups . however , if three - body interactions drive a wd already orbiting a bh into it , then these systems could be anywhere and could include ejected systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if very faint dwarf spheriodals or ultra - faint dwarfs are the hosts of the calcium - rich gap transients and are distributed like the brighter dwarf ellipticals , then these explosions might occur preferentially in clusters or dense groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "of the three most recent transients presented by , two were located in clusters of galaxies , as was one of the two archival events .",
    "x - ray emission should be seen from the gap transients , and should follow a @xmath27 decay law .    using this latter prediction",
    ", we sought to catch one of these calcium - rich gap transients , sn  2012hn , in the decay phase of the light curve .",
    "unfortunately , we did not detect the source in our follow - up x - ray observations .",
    "however , assuming our hypothesis is correct that this transient was a tidal detonation event of a wd , m@xmath102  m@xmath11 and m@xmath103  m@xmath11 in this scenario .",
    "the upper limits are not very constraining because the effective efficiency that includes the accretion efficiency , fallback efficiency , and the bolometric correction is highly uncertain .",
    "if this scenario is correct , a future x - ray observation of one of these sources as close as possible to the time of the transient might detect it and provide much stronger constraints on the masses and the nature of the event .    finally ,",
    "concerning the first two points above , some initial work has been completed to search for the hosts of a few of these transients without success @xcite .",
    "these recent observations rule out for a few sources , including sn  2012hn , that the transient was caused by the tidal detonation induced by a random flyby of an imbh because the upper limits to the masses of host stellar associations are too low .",
    "however , the current sample of calcium - rich gap transients might be heteorgeneous , and @xcite only placed stringent upper limits for a few sources .",
    "in addition , the stringent upper limits rule out most but not all globular clusters and dwarf galaxies .",
    "finally , there are numerous ways three - body interactions could perturb the orbits of a stellar system to force a wd too close to a stellar - mass bh or neutron star .",
