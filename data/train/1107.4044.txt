    "one of the most surprising outcomes of the experiments conducted at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the discovery that high  energy collisions of heavy ions produce strongly interacting hadronic matter ( quark - gluon plasma ",
    "qgp ) that evolves as a low  viscosity fluid  .",
    "this came as a surprise because early expectations , motivated mainly by the asymptotic freedom property of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , were that rhic would create a gas  like system of weakly interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "the strongly interacting nature of the qgp is revealed through the description of measured momentum anisotropies via relativistic viscous hydrodynamics calculations .",
    "the momentum anisotropies are encoded in the fourier moments @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 of the measured azimuthal distribution of particles , and are interpreted as being the translation to momentum space of the initial spatial eccentricity of non central collisions  @xcite .",
    "a  weakly  interacting , gas  like fluid would have no mechanism to induce such a translation into momentum anisotropies , but they can be produced if the particles of the fluid are strongly interacting .    in any attempt of describing experimental results of a heavy ion collision via a viscous hydrodynamics model , crucial physics input reflecting the properties of the flowing hadronic matter must be supplemented , like the equation of state ( eos ) and transport coefficients , as shear ( @xmath9 ) and bulk ( @xmath10 ) viscosities . although it is expected that for the strongly  coupled qgp @xmath9 and @xmath10 will depend strongly on temperature  see below  usually in hydrodynamic simulations temperature  independent values for these coefficients are assumed throughout the entire evolution .",
    "the impact of the temperature dependence of transport coefficients on momentum anisotropies that are obtained from hydrodynamic models has been recently investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    these transport coefficients are , in principle , derivable from first  principles qcd calculations at finite temperature , but in practice , the calculations are extremely difficult at strong coupling",
    ". there is a long history of computations of the eos via large  scale numerical simulations of qcd on a lattice and modern calculations are achieving the accuracy needed for reliable use in heavy - ion physics  for a recent overview on the subject , see ref .",
    "on the other hand , lattice qcd calculations of transport coefficients are still in their infancy and only recently have results for shear and bulk viscosities been obtained  .",
    "analytically , calculations have been performed within qcd for the shear and bulk viscosities   at extremely high temperatures , where perturbation theory in the coupling constant can be used on account of asymptotic freedom .",
    "reliable calculations for these quantities can also be done at very low temperatures , where matter consists essentially of a very dilute gas of pions .",
    "there is plenty of experimental information on elementary low - energy hadron - hadron interactions available that can be used to constrain detailed calculations that go beyond lowest - order in chiral perturbation theory  . on the other hand , in the region of intermediate temperatures , @xmath11 , where one expects the deconfinement and chiral transitions to occur  @xcite , perturbative expansions ( in the coupling constant or chiral ) are not applicable .",
    "there is lack of experimental information on the appropriate degrees of freedom to use and phenomenological approaches are an alternative , like the use of relativistic kinetic theory  .",
    "assuming the validity of a relativistic viscous hydrodynamical description , experimental extraction of transport coefficients should be possible in principle from comparison with measured momentum anisotropy patterns .",
    "moreover , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a comparison with experimental data would allow to pinpoint the location of the qcd phase transition or of a crossover from hadronic to quark - gluon matter . in this context , in addition to the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom related to energy - momentum conservation , degrees of freedom associated with order parameters of broken continuous symmetries must be considered as well since they are all coupled to each other . particularly important to the quest of determining possible signals of the chiral transition",
    "is the coupling of chiral fields to the fluid - dynamical modes .",
    "the present work is a first step towards the study of effects of such a coupling on momentum anisotropies within a viscous hydrodynamic description .",
    "specifically , in the present paper we study , in the context of second  order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics , the influence of the long  wavelength modes of chiral fields on the expansion of the fireball created in au@xmath2au collisions at @xmath12  gev .",
    "in particular , we aim at studying the effect of the coupled evolution of chiral degrees of freedom on the flow asymmetry characterized by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , when finite viscosity is taken into account within a simple microscopic model for the chiral condensate .",
    "in our model the flowing matter consists of a fluid of quarks and antiquarks in local thermal equilibrium that evolves according to a second  order dissipative hydrodynamic model   with temperature - dependent speed of sound and transport coefficients .",
    "starting from a high temperature state with approximately restored chiral symmetry , the system is evolved towards a state where the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the quark - antiquark fluid interacts locally with the chiral fields of the linear @xmath0 model ( lsm )  @xcite .",
    "we compare the results obtained for hadronic observables when the chiral fields are included or not as sources in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "similar models for the dynamics of quarks coupled to chiral fields were considered before .",
    "mishustin and scavenius  @xcite constructed a relativistic mean field _",
    "ideal _ fluid dynamical model based on the lsm , while abada and birse @xcite used the vlasov equation to describe the quarks coupled to the lsm .",
    "both studies focused on the evolution of the chiral fields rather than on the influence of their dynamics on hadronic observables , which is the main focus here .",
    "son  @xcite and pujol and davesne  @xcite have developed modified hydrodynamic theories including additional ( chiral ) symmetry - breaking hydrodynamic variables , which were subsequently applied by lallouet et al .",
    "@xcite to the study of bjorken flow in heavy ",
    "ion collisions .",
    "later on , paech et al .",
    "@xcite coupled 3 + 1 _ ideal _ hydrodynamics to the lsm including fluctuations of the chiral fields and studied the behavior of the azimuthal momentum asymmetry at nonzero impact parameter .",
    "more recently , nahrgang and bleicher  @xcite included phenomenological dissipation and noise terms in the equation of motion of the @xmath0 field of the lsm coupled to ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "they focused on sigma fluctuations and found that at the first order phase transition they lead to an increase in the intensity of sigma excitations .",
    "in a subsequent work , nahrgang , leupold , herold and bleicher  @xcite employed the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action formalism to set up an approximation scheme to derive explicit formulas for the dissipation kernel and the noise correlation function within the lsm .",
    "while the approximations employed deserve careful scrutiny , the formulas derived within the mentioned approximation scheme show interesting features of dissipation and noise on the relaxation dynamics of the chiral dynamics and point to the importance of including reheating of the quark fluid by energy dissipation from the chiral fields , as shown in the very recent papers by nahrgang , leupold and bleicher  @xcite and nahrgang , bleicher , leupold , and mishustin  @xcite . the work of plumari et al .",
    "@xcite is more in the spirit of ours in the present paper , in that they have investigated the role of the chiral transition on @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , the authors have solved numerically the boltzmann ",
    "vlasov transport equations including both two - body collisions and the chiral phase transition as given by the nambu  jona - lasinio model . for conditions prevailing in au + au collisions at @xmath12  gev",
    ", the authors find a sizable suppression of @xmath3 due to the attractive nature of the chiral field dynamics .",
    "they also found that , if @xmath5 is kept fixed , @xmath3 does not depend on the details of the collisional and/or field dynamics and in particular it is not affected significantly by the chiral phase transition .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to state the limited scope of our work .",
    "first of all , while we use a viscous hydro model coupled to a workable chiral model , we do not intend to extract values of transport coefficients by comparing our results to @xmath3 data .",
    "actually , extraction of transport coefficients by matching the output of hydrodynamic and/or kinetic simulations to data is not at all straightforward , as discussed e.g. in refs .  .",
    "in particular , to extract @xmath5 from @xmath3 measurements , a possible route is to first constrain initial @xmath13 and final @xmath14 temperatures ( that are used to run the coupled set of hydro - chiral equations ) by matching calculated spectra to data and , afterwards , extract @xmath5 from @xmath3 data ",
    "see e.g. refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , although we use a semi - realistic initial condition ( we use a glauber smooth initial condition ) , a fluctuating , lumpy initial condition leads to lower elliptic flow along with other interesting effects  @xcite that certainly have an impact on the extraction of transport coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "coupled ] we describe the coupling of the chiral fields to the @xmath1 hydrodynamic model . in section [ solution ] we describe the initial conditions and the freeze  out prescription used in the simulations .",

    "we briefly overview the lsm and the calculation of the speed of sound and of the shear viscosity from the linearized boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation . in appendix",
    "[ cutoff ] we discuss the dependence of our results on the cut  off that we must impose on the value of @xmath5 due to the breakdown of viscous hydrodynamics when nonequilibrium effects start to dominate .",
