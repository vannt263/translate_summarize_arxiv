    "if @xmath281 , then @xmath282 is contained in one component of @xmath259 , as required . if @xmath283 , then we can take @xmath284 and an open disc @xmath285 centred at  @xmath286 so small that @xmath287 consider @xmath269 , @xmath288 . then there exists @xmath289 such that @xmath290 meets both @xmath291 and @xmath292 , by ( [ eqn5.1a ] ) and lemma  [ blowup ] . hence there exist @xmath293 such that",
    "@xmath294 so @xmath295 by the backwards invariance of @xmath282 and ( [ eq5.2 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath296 is a connected subset of @xmath259 that meets both @xmath297 and @xmath269 , which is a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we now deduce theorem  [ kfccomp ] from lemma  [ ef ] .    by lemma  [ ef ] with @xmath298",
    "we deduce that , in order to prove theorem  [ kfccomp ] , it is sufficient to show that , if @xmath299 lies in a single component of @xmath18 , say @xmath300 , then @xmath18 must be connected .",
    "it follows from lemma  [ kfcjf ] that , if there is a component of @xmath18 that does not meet @xmath45 , then it must be a baker domain with a disconnected boundary , or a preimage of such a baker domain .",
    "suppose then that  @xmath71 is such a component",
    ". then @xmath71 has more than one complementary component , each of which is closed and unbounded , and meets @xmath45 .",
    "all the points of @xmath299 lie in these complementary components of @xmath71 , and @xmath299 can not be contained in a single complementary component of  @xmath71 because @xmath301 , by theorem  [ qprops ] .",
    "hence the component  @xmath300 of @xmath18 that contains @xmath299 must meet at least two complementary components of @xmath71 and so it must meet the boundaries of these two complementary components , which are subsets of @xmath302 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath303 .",
    "hence such a component @xmath71 of @xmath18 can not exist .",
    "thus any component of @xmath18 must meet @xmath45 and hence must lie in @xmath300 ; that is , @xmath18 is connected .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we now show that several connectedness properties of @xmath18 follow easily from theorem  [ kfccomp ] .",
    "first , noting eremenko s result  @xcite that @xmath304 , we apply theorem  [ kfccomp ] with @xmath305 to give the following .",
    "[ ik ] let @xmath41 be a transcendental entire function .",
    "if @xmath19 is connected , then @xmath18 is connected .",
    "next , we give conditions for @xmath18 and @xmath306 to be spiders webs .",
    "we say that a connected set @xmath248 is a",
    "_ spider s web _ if there exists a sequence @xmath307 of bounded , simply connected  domains such that @xmath308 clearly , any connected set that contains a spider s web  is itself a spider s web , so it follows from corollary  [ ik ] that if @xmath22 is a spider s web , then @xmath0 is a spider s web .",
    "in fact , we prove the following more general result .",
    "[ sw ] let @xmath41 be a transcendental entire function .",
    "a.   if @xmath18 contains a spider s web , then @xmath18 is a spider s web .",
    "b.   if @xmath306 contains a spider s web , then @xmath309 is a spider s web .",
    "we prove corollary [ sw ] by using various properties of the subset of @xmath19 known as the fast escaping set @xmath310 , which was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the facts that @xmath311 , that all components of @xmath310 are unbounded , and that all components of @xmath312 are unbounded whenever @xmath1 has no multiply connected  fatou components . for proofs of these properties",
    "we refer to  @xcite , for example .    to prove part ( a ) , suppose that @xmath18 contains a spider s web  and let @xmath300 be the component of @xmath18 containing the spider s web .",
    "then , since all the components of @xmath310 are unbounded , we have @xmath313 .",
    "also , since @xmath311 , we can apply theorem  [ kfccomp ] with @xmath314 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 is connected and hence that @xmath18 is a spider s web .",
    "the proof of part ( b ) is similar .",
    "if @xmath309 contains a spider s web , then @xmath1 has no multiply connected  fatou components by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "hence every component of @xmath312 is unbounded , so if @xmath315 is the component of @xmath299 that contains the spider s web , we have @xmath316 .",
    "the result then follows by applying theorem  [ kfccomp ] with @xmath317 .    finally in this section , we prove theorem [ uncount ] .",
    "in fact , we prove the following slightly stronger result .",
    "[ uncount2 ] let @xmath1 be a transcendental entire function  such that @xmath0 is disconnected .",
    "then :    a.   @xmath0 has infinitely many unbounded components ; b.   every neighbourhood  of a point in @xmath11 meets uncountably many components of @xmath92    the proof of theorem [ uncount2](b ) is closely related to other proofs of this type ( for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.3 ) ) , but we give it in full for the convenience of the reader .    for part  ( a ) , we again apply theorem  [ kfccomp ] with @xmath314 and conclude that , if @xmath18 is disconnected , then there are infinitely many components of @xmath18 that meet  @xmath310 .",
    "since , as noted earlier , all components of @xmath310 are unbounded , the result follows .    to prove part  ( b ) , note first",
    "that , since @xmath0 is disconnected , it follows from lemma  [ rempe ] that there exists a closed connected set @xmath318 with two complementary components , say @xmath319 and @xmath101 , each containing points in @xmath0 .",
    "now since the boundaries of @xmath319 and @xmath101 are connected and lie in @xmath320 both @xmath319 and @xmath101 must meet @xmath75 for suppose that @xmath319 , say , lies in @xmath7 .",
    "then since @xmath321 it follows that @xmath319 is a fatou component that is also a component of @xmath92 however , since @xmath322 is connected , lemma [ kfcjf ] shows that this is impossible .",
    "so , for @xmath323 , there exist @xmath324 and a bounded open neighbourhood @xmath325 of  @xmath326 such that @xmath327 .",
    "also , since @xmath45 is unbounded , for each @xmath328 there is a point @xmath329 and a bounded open neighbourhood @xmath330 of @xmath331 with the properties that @xmath332 and @xmath333 as @xmath64 .",
    "now let @xmath10 be an arbitrary point in @xmath11 and let @xmath334 be a bounded open neighbourhood  of @xmath10 . then",
    ", by lemma [ blowup ] , there exists @xmath335 such that @xmath336 and , for any @xmath328 , there exists @xmath337 such that @xmath338    now let @xmath339 be an infinite sequence of @xmath114s and @xmath340s .",
    "we will show that there is an uncountable set of such sequences that encode the orbits of points that lie in distinct components of @xmath0 that meet @xmath341 .    to show this , put @xmath342 and , for @xmath343 set @xmath344    then , for each sequence @xmath339 , it follows from ( [ blowup1 ] ) , ( [ blowup2 ] ) and lemma  [ rslemm ] that there is a corresponding sequence @xmath345 and a point @xmath346 such that @xmath347 for @xmath348 furthermore , all such points must lie in @xmath92    we now claim that points in @xmath349 whose orbits are encoded by different infinite sequences of @xmath114s and @xmath340s must lie in different components of @xmath0 . for",
    "if two such sequences differ , then some iterate of @xmath1 will map one point to @xmath319 and the other to @xmath101 .",
    "thus , if the two points are in the same component @xmath76 of @xmath0 , then some iterate of @xmath76 meets @xmath350 which is a contradiction .",
    "evidently , the set of all sequences @xmath339 of @xmath114s and @xmath340s can be put in one - to - one correspondence with the binary representations of points in the unit interval .",
    "we have therefore shown that every neighbourhood  of an arbitrary point in @xmath11 meets uncountably many components of @xmath0 , and this proves part  ( b ) .",
    "it follows by a similar argument to the proof of theorem [ uncount2](b ) that , for a transcendental entire function  @xmath1 , every neighbourhood  of a point in @xmath11 meets uncountably many components of @xmath351 the proof uses lemma  [ rslemm ] with the compact sets @xmath352 , @xmath353 , in the above proof replaced by @xmath354 , @xmath353 .",
    "in this section , we give details of the two examples referred to in the remarks after the statement of theorem [ fullresult ] .      [ genex ]",
    "let @xmath1 be the transcendental entire function  defined by @xmath355 then @xmath1 satisfies the conditions of theorem [ fullresult ] , so @xmath0 is connected , but there is no @xmath104 such that @xmath116 as @xmath356        let @xmath358 be the sequence of nested domains defined by @xmath359 ( here , for convenience , we have labelled the domains with subscripts in @xmath360 rather than in @xmath106 . )",
    "each domain @xmath115 is the union of two rectangles , the larger in the right half - plane and the smaller in the left half - plane ( see figure [ figex ] ) .",
    "it is clear that condition  ( b ) in the statement of theorem [ fullresult ] is satisfied by this sequence of domains .",
    "we now show that condition  ( a ) in the statement of theorem [ fullresult ] is also satisfied for @xmath361 . to see this , consider figure [ figex ] , in which sections of the boundary of  @xmath115 are labelled with lower case letters and their images under @xmath1 with the corresponding upper case letters .",
    "the following brief notes discuss the images of different sections of the boundary of @xmath115 using the same labelling as in the figure .      on this section @xmath368 , where @xmath369 , so @xmath370 lies in the left half - plane , below the line @xmath371 , and hence outside @xmath366 . the image of this section meets the imaginary axis at @xmath372 ( off the scale in figure [ figex ] )",
    "here @xmath373 , where @xmath374 the term @xmath375 is dominant , and since this section has length @xmath376 , the image of the section winds around the origin , the factor of @xmath377 ensuring that it stays outside @xmath378 the image is thus a spiralling curve joining @xmath379 to @xmath380 .",
    "this section of the boundary is the union of the three line segments @xmath381 on all three segments the modulus of @xmath382 is at least @xmath383 and exceeds the modulus of @xmath384 by a factor of at least 20 , so the images of these segments lie well outside @xmath385 .",
    "most of these images lies off the scale in figure [ figex ] .",
    "next , we show that not all transcendental entire functions that are strongly polynomial - like  in the sense defined in @xcite meet the conditions of theorem [ fullresult ]",
    ". the authors are grateful to dave sixsmith for suggesting this example .            to show that property ( i ) is also satisfied , consider first the images under @xmath1 of the two sides of the rectangle @xmath115 parallel to the real axis .",
    "writing @xmath393 we see that @xmath1 maps both these sides into the annulus @xmath394 which clearly lies outside @xmath389 for all @xmath395    next , if @xmath10 lies on the vertical side of @xmath115 in the right half - plane , we have @xmath396 where @xmath397 .",
    "similarly , for points on the vertical side of @xmath115 in the left half - plane , @xmath398 it follows that @xmath388 surrounds @xmath389 , for @xmath126 so @xmath1 is strongly polynomial - like .",
    "now , @xmath1 has fixed points at @xmath399 .",
    "these fixed points are repelling if @xmath400 is odd and superattracting if @xmath400 is even , and all points on the real axis except for the repelling fixed points tend under iteration towards the nearest superattracting fixed point .",
    "it follows that the real axis lies in @xmath15 , and indeed that the real axis is a closed , connected set in @xmath15 that disconnects @xmath0 ."
