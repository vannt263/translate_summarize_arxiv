    "numerical relativity in higher - dimensional spacetimes could be a powerful tool to study a variety of physical concepts , such as the stability of black hole solutions and their interactions , as well as for producing phenomenological information of relevance for tev gravity scenarios @xcite .",
    "in such models , the fundamental planck scale could be as low as 1 tev .",
    "thus , high - energy colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , may directly probe strongly coupled gravitational physics @xcite . indeed , in this scenario , particle collisions could produce black holes @xcite .",
    "moreover , the production of black holes at trans - planckian collision energies ( compared to the fundamental planck scale ) should be well - described by using classical general relativity extended to d dimensions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical simulations of high - energy black hole collisions in higher - dimensional spacetimes , then , could give an accurate estimate of the fractions of the collision energy and angular momentum that are lost in the higher - dimensional space by emission of gravitational waves ; such information would be extremely important to improve the modeling of microscopic black hole production , and of the ensuing evaporation phase , which might be observed during lhc collisions .",
    "the growing interest in dynamical aspects of higher - dimensional spacetimes led to the development of higher - dimensional numerical relativity  @xcite and to the production of the first black hole collisions in higher - dimensional spacetimes starting from rest  @xcite , and , most recently , of black holes with initial boost @xcite . aside from their immediate relevance in the context of tev gravity scenarios , high - energy collisions of black holes provide fertile ground for probing strong - field effects of general relativity , such as cosmic censorship , luminosity limits , hoop type conjectures and zoom - whirl behaviour @xcite .",
    "the modeling of generic black hole or neutron - star spacetimes in the framework of einstein s theory of general relativity requires a numerical treatment because of the enormous complexity of the equations in the absence of high degrees of symmetry . for such numerical modeling",
    ", the einstein equations are cast as a time evolution or _ initial value _ problem as originally formulated by arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) @xcite and reformulated by york @xcite . numerically generating a solution",
    "then consists of two basic steps : ( i ) the construction of initial data which satisfy the constraint equations and represent a realistic snapshot of the physical system under consideration and ( ii ) the evolution in time of these initial data . in this work",
    "we will focus on the first step and provide a formalism for constructing initial data for black hole binaries with nonzero boosts in higher , @xmath2 , dimensional spacetimes .",
    "most work on the generation of initial data in @xmath3-dimensional general relativity is based on the york - lichnerowicz split @xcite which rearranges the degrees of freedom contained in the three - metric @xmath4 and extrinsic curvature @xmath5 via a conformal transformation and a split of the curvature into trace and traceless part @xmath6 followed by a transverse - traceless decomposition of either the traceless extrinsic curvature @xmath7 or a conformally rescaled version @xmath8 thereof . for details of these _ physical _ or _ conformal transverse - traceless _ decompositions as well as the alternative _ conformal thin - sandwich _ formalism",
    ", we refer the reader to cook s review  @xcite , alcubierre s book  @xcite and references therein .    one of the main advantages achieved with this decomposition is the decoupling of the momentum from the hamiltonian constraint under the additional simplifying assumptions of conformal flatness , @xmath9 and a constant trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath10 .",
    "quite remarkably , the resulting equations for the momentum constraints admit analytic solutions describing multiple black holes with nonvanishing spins and linear momenta  @xcite . there then remains a single elliptic differential equation , the hamiltonian constraint , for the conformal factor @xmath11 which requires a numerical treatment . by applying a compactification to the internal asymptotically flat region ,",
    "brandt & brgmann  @xcite derived a method of solving the hamiltonian constraint which is now generally referred to as the _ puncture _ method .",
    "these puncture data form the starting point for the majority of numerical simulations using the _ moving - puncture _",
    "method  @xcite .",
    "we note that an alternative approach to evolving the einstein equations based on the _ generalized harmonic _ formulation has been implemented with similar success  @xcite .    as shown by yoshino _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the existence of an analytic solution of the bowen - york type for the momentum constraints carries over to the theory of general relativity in higher dimensions .",
    "these authors also solved the hamiltonian constraint using a finite difference method . here",
    ", we will present a generalization of the spectral solver by ansorg _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , used inside the cactus toolkit  @xcite , that solves the hamiltonian constraint for black hole binaries in @xmath2 dimensions with nonvanishing initial boost , and preserves the spectral convergence properties observed in four dimensions . the compactification implemented in this solver further facilitates direct interpolation of the initial data onto computational grids of arbitrary size with mesh refinement employed in state - of - the - art numerical simulations of black hole spacetimes .",
    "finally , the initial data are generated in variables that can be straightforwardly translated to evolution systems common in numerical relativity , such as the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura @xcite system in cartesian form . in our case",
    ", we specifically translate the spectral solution into the formalism of  @xcite which can thus be readily used to perform high - energy collisions of two black holes in @xmath0 dimensions .",

    "the growth of the constraint violation near the puncture is an artifact of finite - differencing across the puncture ; see text for details.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper we have presented numerical solutions of the einstein constraint equations for the construction of initial data containing single or binary black holes with nonvanishing linear momentum in @xmath201 dimensional spacetimes . for this purpose",
    "we have modified the spectral solver of ref .  @xcite . as in @xmath57 dimensions ,",
    "the momentum constraints decouple from the hamiltonian constraint under the assumption of conformal flatness and a spatially constant trace of the extrinsic curvature and allow for an analytic solution describing multiple black holes with nonzero momenta .",
    "one thus arrives at a single elliptic differential equation for the conformal factor or , to be more specific , a regular correction function @xmath54 to the brill - lindquist part of the conformal factor .",
    "we have studied the resulting differential equation in the limit of a single black hole with small boost in order to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath54 at spatial infinity , where we find @xmath208 . for @xmath159",
    "we further observe that @xmath54 is an analytic function expanded in terms of the coordinate @xmath111 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : xtoa ] ) ] around spatial infinity , so that a spectral algorithm should provide exponential convergence . for @xmath60",
    "the expansion of @xmath54 includes a logarithmic term , but , as has also been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath57 , this term is subdominant in the case of a black hole binary with equal and opposite momenta . we have used the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath54 to adapt the set of coordinates employed in the spectral solver to arbitrary dimensionality and further performed a transformation to a radial coordinate that ensures sufficient resolution near spatial infinity for the case of large separation of the two holes .    the resulting code has been used to calculate initial data for black hole binaries with linear momenta along the @xmath76-axis , _",
    "i.e. _  corresponding to a head - on collision .",
    "even though the number of grid points required for reaching a given threshold accuracy increases with @xmath0 , we observe rapid convergence for all values @xmath1 .",
    "although for large resolutions @xmath186 the convergence becomes algebraic due to logarithmic terms in the @xmath148 dependency of the solution @xmath54 for @xmath57 and @xmath60 , this transition can be compensated with a moderate increase in the number of grid points @xmath186 as has also been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath57 .",
    "closer investigation of the profile of the function @xmath54 thus obtained confirms the expected higher falloff rate as @xmath156 for larger @xmath0 .",
    "we further note that @xmath54 shows smooth behaviour near the puncture .",
    "finally , we have studied the hamiltonian constraint as a function along the collision axis . as in @xmath57 , the residual constraint violations after the elliptic solving are largest near the puncture and rapidly falloff away from the puncture . as expected from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath54 , the constraint violations decay even faster away from the puncture as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the construction of initial data forms a crucial step in performing high - energy collisions of black hole binaries in higher - dimensional spacetimes which will complement existing studies in @xmath57 dimensions @xcite as well as studies in @xmath60 dimensions @xcite starting from superposed single black hole initial data .",
