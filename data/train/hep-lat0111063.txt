    "euclidean feynman path integral uniquely identifies the ground state of a field theory ( vaccum)@xcite .",
    "the feynman functional integral is defined as the limit of ordinary integrals defined on discrete set of points in a four dimensional box , when the number of points is sent to infinity filling the box densely ; the size of the box is then sent to infinity to cover the whole space time .",
    "lattice formulation is an approssimant in this sequence .",
    "qcd has an uv fixed point at @xmath0 ( asymptotic freedom ) : as @xmath1 the physical length scale @xmath2 increases in units of the lattice spacing @xmath3 @xmath4 the density of lattice points in physical units goes large . on the other hand a mass gap exists in the theory , which makes the infinite volume limit well defined as a thermodynamical limit .",
    "lattice is a good approximant of qcd if @xmath5 with @xmath6 the size of the lattice .",
    "the above argument is a strong indication that qcd most probably exists as a field theory in the constructive sense , and can be defined as a limit of lattice formulation as @xmath7 , and @xmath6 is such that the inequality ( [ eq2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the textbook quantization of qcd is based on perturbation theory , and the ground state is fock vacuum of quarks and gluons .",
    "phenomenological evidence exists@xcite that the qcd vacuum is not the perturbative vacuum .",
    "the instability of fock s vacuum is possibly the origin of the non borel summability of the perturbative expansion@xcite .",
    "perturbation theory apparently works at small distances but is not well defined and is unable to describe large distance physics .",
    "the most clear evidence that fock vacuum is not a good approximation to qcd ground state , is that its elementary excitations , quarks and gluons , have never been observed as free particles .",
    "this phenomenon is known as confinement of colour and is one of the most intriguing properties of qcd .",
    "the study of the mechanism of confinement is an important chapter of the investigation of the structure of qcd vacuum on the lattice , and will be the object of this talk . in sect.2 i will review the experimental evidence for confinement . in sect.3",
    "i will discuss the phenomenology of the deconfinement transition as observed in numerical simulations on the lattice .",
    "this will naturally lead us to the idea of duality , which will be the object of sect.4 .",
    "progress in understanding confinement as dual superconductivity of the vacuum will be reviewed in sect.5",
    "confinement is defined as the absence of colored particles in asymptotic states .",
    "the existing experimental evidence for confinement is based on the negative result of searches of fractionally charged particles ( quarks ) in particle reactions and in nature .",
    "the cross section @xmath8 for the inclusive production of quark or antiquark in the process @xmath9 at c.m .",
    "energies @xmath10  gev has an upper limit@xcite @xmath11 to be compared with the total cross section @xmath12 at the same energy @xmath13 .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 has then the upper bound @xmath15 while the expected value in the absence of confinement is a sizable fraction of unity .",
    "the negative result of the search of fractionally charged particles in ordinary matter by millikan - like experiments gives an upper limit for the ratio @xmath16 of the quarks abundance @xmath17 to nucleons abundance @xmath18 @xmath19 corresponding to the analysis of @xmath20  gr of matter .    in the absence of confinement",
    "the expectation for @xmath16 , @xmath21 , in the standard cosmological model is @xmath22@xcite .",
    "again @xmath23 a ratio smaller than @xmath24 , if different from zero , would be too small to have a natural explanation in any theory .",
    "the most natural interpretation is then that those ratios are strictly zero , or that confinement is an absolute property of the vacuum based on a symmetry@xcite .",
    "the question is : what symmetry of qcd vacuum prevents quarks to exist as free particles ?    as for gluons , they have no such characteristic signature as a fractional charge , and their identification is not clearly feasible .",
    "no experimental data exist on gluon confinement .",
    "we shall define anyhow confinement as absence of any colored particle as a free particle .",
    "qcd at finite temperature can be studied on the lattice .",

    "the value of @xmath3 in physical units depends on the coupling constant ( @xmath32 ) via renormalization group @xmath33 with @xmath34 hence @xmath35 as a consequence of asymptotic freedom low temperature ( confinement ) corresponds to strong coupling ( large @xmath36 ) or to disorder in the language of statistical mechanics , high temperature corresponds to order or to weak couling .",
    "if confinement is due to a symmetry , it has to be a symmetry of the disordered phase .",
    "this naturally leads to the idea of duality , which will be the object of sect.3 .",
    "the deconfinement transition is detected on the lattice in pure gauge theory , by looking at the correlator @xmath37 where @xmath38 , the polyakov line , is the trace of the parallel transport along the time axis across the lattice and back via periodic boundary conditions @xmath39 the static potential between a @xmath40 pair is given by @xmath41 by cluster property , at large distances @xmath42 a critical temperature @xmath43 is observed such that @xmath44 confinement is related to the presence of a linear potential at large distances : @xmath45 is known as string tension .    for @xmath46 gauge theory the phase transition at @xmath43 is second order , and belongs to the universality class of the @xmath47 ising model . @xmath48@xcite .    for @xmath49 gauge theory",

    "the chiral symmetry is again explicitely broken .",
    "it is qualitatively clear that confinement can produce a breaking of chiral symmetry : in a bag model chirality is inverted in the reflection on the confining wall .",
    "numerical indications also exist that the two transitions take place at the same temperature .",
    "however the overall situation is not satisfactory .",
    "first of all if a phase exist in which color is confined , and a phase at higher temperature in which quarks and gluons are free particles , an exact order parameter should exist for this transition .",
    "in addition a strong theoretical hint exists that , when the number of colors @xmath54 is sent large , with the constraint @xmath55 fixed , a limiting theory is defined , which does not differ much in its physical content from the realistic theory where @xmath56 .",
    "the expansion in @xmath57 should be a convergent expansion@xcite .    in this philosophy quark loops",
    "are non leading @xmath58 and therefore the physics of confinement , i.e. the symmetry , should be the same as in quenched approximation .",
    "duality is a deep concept in field theory , in statistical mechanics , in string theory .",

    "monopoles are defined by a procedure named `` abelian projection''@xcite based on the choice of a local operator in the adjoint representation , as discussed below . in a sense",
    "the mechanism is largely undefined , since there is a continuous infinity of choices for the operator used to define the monopoles and their interrelation is not understood .",
    "a guess is that all these choices are physically equivalent@xcite .",
    "+ the positive feature is that confinement is explained in a simple form : the chromoelectric field of a @xmath79 pair is channeled into an abrikosov flux tube with energy proportional to the length , i.e. to the distance @xmath80 between the pair@xcite @xmath81 @xmath45 , the energy per unit length of the tube , is the string tension . * _ vortices_. a vortex is a magnetic defect associated to a closed line @xmath82 .",

    "it can be shown that , whenever @xmath90 obeys the area law , @xmath91 , as the loop goes large , @xmath92 obeys the perimeter law , and viceversa if @xmath92 obeys the area law , @xmath90 obeys the perimeter law .",
    "+ area law implies that @xmath93 , the expectation value of the polyakov line vanishes .",
    "one can define a dual polyakov line @xmath94 wich is a vortex along a straight path crossing space from @xmath95 to @xmath96 . then for @xmath52 , @xmath97 , for @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 is a disorder parameter for confinement@xcite .",
    "the definition of monopoles is associated to the choice of an operator @xmath101 in the adjoint representation : we will speak of @xmath46 gauge group for simplicity , but the procedure is easily generalized to @xmath102 .",

    "indeed @xmath111 the gauge transformation bringing @xmath61 in the same direction ( say ( 0,0,1 ) ) in color space is called abelian projection .",
    "after abelian projection @xmath112 the source of the dual tensor @xmath113 is a magnetic current @xmath114 and is conserved . the corresponding @xmath78 magnetic symmetry can either be wigner , and then a magnetic charge operator is defined and hilbert space is superselected , or be higgs broken , which implies the existence of at least one magnetically charged operator @xmath62 such that @xmath115 .",

    "the phase transition was always conjectured to be produced by condensation of vortices , but that condensation was detected in numerical simulations by observing an increase of the number of vortices in condensed phase : our construction shows that @xmath125 , or that the number of vortices is not defined in the vacuum of the condensed phase@xcite .",
    "for the heisenberg model we have found@xcite that the curie transition can be looked as an order disorder transition , and that the high temperature phase is ordered in the dual language , by condensation of non abelian @xmath126 vortices .",
    "a numerical problem has also been solved ; @xmath62 defined by eq.([eqmu ] ) is the exponential of an integral over the spatial volume : therefore it fluctuates typically as @xmath127 , which is a wild fluctuation .",

    "@xmath129 is the ordinary partition function of the theory , and @xmath130 corrisponds to a modification of the action coming from the exponent in @xmath62 , eq.([eqmu ] ) .    a way out of this difficulty consists@xcite in considering instead of @xmath64 the quantity @xmath131 @xmath132 , which contains all the relevant information of @xmath64 .",
    "a typical shape of @xmath64 is shown in fig.1 .",

    "the limit can be performed by a finite size scaling analysis as follows ; if @xmath135 is the critical index of @xmath62 and @xmath136 the reduced temperature , @xmath137 then @xmath138 the functional dipendence is dictated by the fact that @xmath61 is dimensionless : @xmath3 is the lattice spacing , @xmath2 the correlation length , @xmath6 the extension of the lattice . as @xmath139 , @xmath2 goes large with a critical index @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 can be approximated with 0 ( scaling limit ) , and @xmath143 can be traded with @xmath144 . hence @xmath145 and @xmath146 @xmath147 is a universal function of @xmath144 , i.e. it scales when plotted versus @xmath144 .",
    "since this scaling law is valid for the appropriate value of @xmath140 and @xmath148 , the determination of @xmath140 , @xmath148 and @xmath135 is then possible .",

    "the independence of the result from the choice of the abelian projection has been checked by performing the analysis in a number of different abelian projections , but also averaging on a very large number ( infinite ) of abelian projections@xcite .",
    "the same disorder parameter @xmath64 can be used in full @xmath161 ( including dynamical quarks ) where it is well defined , contrary to @xmath162 whose symmetry @xmath51 is explicitely broken by the very presence of quarks and to @xmath163 , whose symmetry is broken by quark masses .",

    "preliminary results@xcite , however , indicate that also in full qcd there is a transition from dual superconductor to normal across the transition .",
    "if these preliminary indications get confirmed by the quantitative analysis which is on the way , we would have a good order parameter for confinement , even in the presence of ( massive ) quarks . in principle",

    "an analysis of quenched gauge theories at @xmath165 is on the way , to perform the brute force check of the limit .",
    "however our results are still far from complete .",
    "they indicate that , whatever the dual fundamental excitations are , they carry magnetic charge in all the abelian projections . a real theoretical breakthrough would be to identify such excitations , and to write an effective lagrangian for them to describe qcd in the confined phase .        99 r.p .",
