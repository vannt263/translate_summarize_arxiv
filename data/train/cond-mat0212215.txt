    "if liquid silica ( sio@xmath2 ) is cooled below its melting temperature , it usually does not crystallize , but stays a supercooled liquid for an extended period of time . upon further cooling , to below a certain temperature known as the glass transition temperature @xmath3 ,",
    "it becomes highly viscous and shows many properties of ordinary solids , but stays disordered and does not evolve to the thermodynamically stable crystalline phase , at least on earthly time scales .",
    "the study of silica in its disordered phase ( vitreous silica ) is hampered by a lack of knowledge on its microscopic structure .",
    "experimental techniques alone , such as neutron and x - ray scattering , which can uniquely resolve the structure of a crystal , are less successful in this case because of the lack of a repeating unit cell .",
    "typically , only information averaged over many atoms , such as the radial distribution function , can be obtained from experiments .    an alternative method to study vitreous silica",
    "is through computer simulations .",
    "the usual computational approach to generate vitreous silica structures is to simulate a quench from the melt within the framework of molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "this resembles closely the experimental process used to prepare vitreous silica , except that the typical computational cooling rates are about ten orders of magnitude faster than experimental ones . in agreement with experiment",
    ", these md simulations result in structures of vitreous silica in which almost all silicon atoms are bonded to four oxygen atoms and almost all oxygen atoms are bonded to two silicon atoms , without any sign of long - range order  @xcite . this in turn is in agreement with the continuous random network ( crn ) model , proposed by zachariasen  @xcite .",
    "the high cooling rates used in md simulations result in structures with a strain higher than observed in experiments .",
    "this shows up , for instance , as an anomalously high density of coordination defects and a larger spread in bond lengths and bond angles . in this paper",
    "we present an alternative approach to generate models of vitreous silica .",
    "in contrast to md , we do not attempt to simulate the details of the dynamics of the melt - quenching process .",
    "instead , we use a monte carlo ( mc ) scheme with an artificial dynamics consisting of _ bond transpositions_. our scheme is similar in spirit to the one used by tu _",
    "et al . _  in their study of silica and silica sub - oxides  @xcite , which in turn is based on the algorithm of wooten , winer and weaire ( www ) for the generation of four - fold coordinated crns  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first describe the mc scheme used by tu _",
    "et al_. we then move on to describe a number of optimizations to this algorithm .",
    "these optimizations allow us to generate large and well - relaxed silica networks containing up to 300,000 atoms .",
    "the properties of these networks are discussed and compared to md - prepared networks and experiment in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "we end with a number of conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "in the approach followed by tu and co - workers , a vitreous silica network consists of @xmath4 silicon atoms and @xmath5 oxygen atoms .",
    "the total number of atoms in the network thus equals @xmath6 . at all times",
    ", an explicit list of bonds is maintained which uniquely determines the connectivity or topology of the network . in the list of bonds , each silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms , and each oxygen atom is bonded to two silicon atoms .",
    "the total number of bonds in the list thus equals @xmath7 .    to calculate energy and forces the following potential",
    "is used : @xmath8 where the first summation runs over the list of bonds , and the second summation over all pairs of bonds that share one atom ; @xmath9 represents the length of the @xmath10-th bond , and @xmath11 is the angle between bonds @xmath10 and @xmath12 ( which share one atom ) .",
    "the potential parameters for the two - body interaction are given by @xmath13  ev and @xmath14   .",
    "for the three - body interaction common values are @xmath15  ev and @xmath16 ; for interactions these values are @xmath17  ev and @xmath18 . since the number of bonds in the network grows linearly with the number of atoms it contains , each energy evaluation is an @xmath19 operation .",
    "the network is evolved by making explicit changes in the list of bonds , each time followed by a local energy minimization with respect to the geometric coordinates of all atoms ( using for example the method of steepest descent ) .",
    "the changes in the list of bonds consist of bond transpositions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwwsilica ] .",
    "each bond transposition is accepted with the metropolis acceptance probability  @xcite : @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath22 is the temperature , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the ( minimized ) energies of the network before and after the proposed bond transposition .",
    "we have optimized the bond - switching algorithm of tu _ et al . _",
    "for the generation of large and well relaxed silica networks .",
    "these optimizations are similar in spirit to the optimizations used in the scalable www algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the first optimization is aimed at reducing the cpu time spent on rejected bond transpositions . after a bond transposition in the original algorithm ,",
    "the energy of the network is always completely minimized .",
    "after the minimization , the bond transposition is either accepted or rejected based on the metropolis probability .",
    "in contrast , we reformulate the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we first determine a threshold energy @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a random number uniformly drawn from the interval @xmath27 .",
    "we then proceed with the minimization procedure . during minimization",
    ", the converged energy is continuously estimated .",
    "assuming that the total energy is harmonic around the minimum with curvature @xmath28 , the energy @xmath29 at the ( unknown ) minimum @xmath30 can be estimated from a nearby configuration @xmath31 as @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the magnitude of the total force at @xmath31 .",
    "minimization is aborted as soon as it becomes clear that the threshold energy will not be reached and the bond transposition will be rejected .",
    "this leads to a large reduction in the number of force evaluations associated with rejected bond transpositions .",
    "the second optimization is aimed at exploiting the local nature of the bond transposition depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwwsilica ] . immediately after a bond transposition",
    ", only a small cluster of atoms in the network will experience a significant force .",
    "this cluster consists of the atoms directly involved in the bond transposition , marked @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwwsilica ] , and of nearby atoms ( typically extending to the fourth neighbor shell around these five transposition atoms ) .",
    "the number of atoms in such a cluster is about 400 .",
    "it therefore suffices to calculate the force _ locally _ ( only for the 400 or so atoms inside the cluster ) rather than _ globally _",
    "( for all the atoms in the network ) .",
    "calculating the force on a cluster of atoms is an @xmath35 operation , which means that it is independent of the total number of atoms in the network .",
    "local force calculations are therefore much cheaper than global @xmath19 force calculations .    already after a converged local minimization ,",
    "it is often clear that the threshold energy will not be reached , and the bond transposition can be rejected . if this is not the case , a few global minimization steps are required additionally , usually resulting in an accepted bond transposition .",
    "the combination of these two improvements reduces the computational effort from @xmath19 operations per attempted bond transposition to @xmath35 operations per attempted bond transposition , plus a few @xmath19 operations per accepted bond transposition .",
    "since common acceptance probabilities are well below 1% , the speed - up for large systems is about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the optimized bond - switching algorithm for silica requires an initial network , which should be free of coordination defects and crystalline regions . as noted in ref .",
    ", four - fold coordinated crns decorated with one oxygen atom on each bond already provide structures that compare reasonably well to vitreous silica .",
    "as initial network we therefore use a periodic , four - fold coordinated crn generated as described in refs .",
    "this crn serves as the silicon backbone .",
    "next , one oxygen atom is placed on the center of each bond to obtain a properly coordinated silica network . the simulation volume",
    "is then scaled to obtain the experimental density of silica @xmath36  g  @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "a computationally more expensive , but also more realistic potential for silica is the bks potential  @xcite : @xmath38 where the sum runs over all pairs of atoms in the system , @xmath39 is the distance between atoms @xmath10 and @xmath12 , and @xmath40 is the charge of atom @xmath10 . the atomic charges and the values of the potential parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are also listed in ref .",
    "we use the fast multipole code developed at duke university  @xcite to compute the coulomb and van der waals interactions .",
    "the exponential term is truncated at @xmath44    and then shifted , as described in ref .  .",
    "the bond - switching algorithm described above generates networks that are local energy minima according to the potential of tu _ et al .",
    "_ the algorithm can be changed such that these networks will be sampled from the boltzmann distribution according to the bks potential at temperature @xmath22 . to this end , the acceptance probability of eq .",

    "_  undergo an additional accept / reject decision based on the bks potential . by increasing the temperature @xmath48",
    "we can increase the number of moves that will be accepted under the potential of tu _",
    "et al_. in the limit @xmath49 , all such moves are accepted . in this limit , the accept / reject decision is based solely on the bks potential and @xmath22 . while correct , this situation is undesirable because bks energy evaluations are expensive . in practice ,",
    "a lower @xmath48 is used and the temperatures @xmath50 are tuned to maximize the decrease of the bks energy of the network as a function of simulation time .",
    "we have used the optimized bond - switching algorithm described in section  [ sec : opt ] to generate vitreous silica networks containing 3000 atoms ( ` 3k ' ) , 60,000 atoms ( ` 60k ' ) and 300,000 atoms ( ` 300k ' ) . for the 3000-atom and the 60,000-atom networks",

    "recently , we developed a method to determine the configurational entropy of a network  @xcite .",
    "the method requires only the atomic coordinates and a list of bonds between particles , for a single well - relaxed configuration . in the original paper ,",
    "the method was applied to a silica network consisting of 3000 atoms . starting with the atomic coordinates of this network ,",
    "the list of bonds was constructed using @xmath58    for the bond - length cutoff .",
    "each bridge was replaced by a single bond .",
    "we then applied our method to the resulting silicon backbone network to obtain for the configurational entropy @xmath65  @xmath21 per silicon atom .",
    "the accuracy of the method is sensitive to the size of the network .",
    "as mentioned in the original paper , the configurational entropy of vitreous silica reported above is most likely an underestimate due to the limited size of that network .",
    "the large networks generated in this work allow us to quantify these finite size effects .",
    "they also allow us to determine the minimum size of a network that is required to accurately measure the configurational entropy .    to this end",
    ", we use our method to determine the entropy of networks ` 3k ' , ` 60k ' and ` 300k ' in two different ways : first , by using the entire simulation volume of the network ; secondly , by using only half the volume of the simulation cell .",
    "the first procedure yields entropies of 0.83 , 0.99 and 1.04  @xmath21 per silicon atom , respectively , while the second procedure yields 0.78 , 0.97 and 1.03  @xmath21 per silicon atom , respectively .",
    "this illustrates that finite - size effects are significant for the smallest network , but small for the large ones .",
    "most of the difference in entropy between the three networks is due to the varying degree of relaxation in these networks .",
    "in summary , we have presented a monte carlo - based approach for the generation of well - relaxed networks of vitreous silica , based on earlier work of tu _ et al_. with this method , networks containing 3000 , 60,000 and 300,000 atoms are generated . compared to networks generated with molecular dynamics , our networks have smaller bond - angle variations and are nearly defect - free , indicating they are better relaxed .",
    "the total correlation function @xmath0 of our networks is in excellent agreement with neutron scattering experiments ( with @xmath66 factors around 5% ) , provided that thermal effects and the maximum experimental inverse wavelength @xmath67 are included in the comparison .",
    "we also determined the silicon coordination number of our networks by fitting a gaussian to @xmath1 , as is commonly done in experiments .",
    "we observe that the results of this procedure are biased to lower numbers by the non - gaussian nature of the peaks , and to higher numbers due to finite value of @xmath67 .",
