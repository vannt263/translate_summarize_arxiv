    "recently , kallivayalil et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter k06 ) measured the proper motion of the the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and pioneered a first assessment of its 3d velocity vector . based on this measurement , besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter b07 ) concluded that the lmc was unlikely to have passed near the milky way ( mw ) before and was most likely formed outside of the boundaries of the galaxy , in contrast to traditional scenarios ( see references in van der marel et al .",
    "2002 ; hereafter vdm02 ) .",
    "this new conclusion is intriguing given that there are no other examples of massive gas - rich galaxies like the lmc within the much bigger volume that separates the mw from its neighboring galaxy , andromeda ( m31 ) .",
    "other recent studies have also found the b07 results difficult to accept and propose alternate strategies of binding the lmc and mw either through mond gravity ( wu et al . 2008 ) or by giving the lmc and its smaller counterpart , the small magellanic cloud , a common halo ( bekki 2008 ) .    a couple of years after k06 published their findings , piatek et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter p08 ) confirmed independently their results to within one standard deviation , although at the lower end of the inferred range of values . also , within the past five years , the circular velocity of the mw and the distance between the sun and the galactic center have been updated by reid & brunthaler ( 2004 ; hereafter rb04 ) and gillessen et al .",
    "( 2008 ; hereafter gge08 ) , respectively .",
    "these increased the likely circular velocity of the mw from the iau standard of @xmath2  to 251@xmath3 .",
    "a value of 220  now corresponds to a reduction of the best - fit value by two standard deviations ( and equivalent to moving the sun a total of 1 kpc closer to the center of the galaxy ) .",
    "uemura et al . ( 2000 ) used parallax measurements from hipparcos and skymap to obtain a similar value of @xmath4 .",
    "the rotation speed of the mw affects the analysis of the past lmc orbit in two ways .",
    "first , because the proper motion of the lmc is measured relative to the solar system which orbits the galaxy , it is necessary to know the rotational velocity of the sun in order to transform to the galactocentric frame ( see , e.g. vdm02 ) .",
    "second , the depth of the gravitational potential well of the mw ( involving its estimated mass and scale radius ) depends on the normalization of its rotation curve .",
    "b07 adopted the iau standard in their analysis instead of the modified values for the milky way s rotation . in this _",
    ", we examine the implications of the change in the mw parameters for the lmc orbit ( also with the updated p08 value ) . in the particular geometry of the lmc orbit ,",
    "both of the above - mentioned effects make the lmc more gravitationally bound to the mw owing to an increase in @xmath5 . despite the small fractional magnitude of the correction in circular velocity ( @xmath0 ) , we find that the qualitative nature of the lmc orbit changes . instead of the lmc being possibly unbound as suggested by b07 , the @xmath6 decrease in the lmc velocity and the @xmath7 increase in the mw mass lead us to conclude that the lmc s past trajectory was probably confined within the virial radius of the mw .",
    "the apogalacticon distance of the orbit is comparable to the mw virial radius , as expected for a satellite that had formed at the outer edge of the galactic halo .",
    "traditional studies of the lmc s orbit around the mw ( e.g. , murai & fujimoto 1980 ; lin & lynden - bell 1982 ; gardiner et al . 1994 ; lin et al .",
    "1995 ; gardiner & noguchi 1996 ; vdm02 ; bekki & chiba 2005 ; mastropietro et al .",
    "2005 ; connors et al .",
    "2006 ) considered the mw as an isolated galaxy .",
    "while this might have been acceptable for studies where the lmc s orbit was confined well within the mw halo , the high lmc velocity measured by k06 and p08 implies ( b07 ) that the apogalacticon could extend beyond the edge of the mw s halo  where the gravitational influence of m31 is non - negligible ( see table 1 in b07 ) .",
    "thus , we also include the tidal effect of m31 in our calculations .",
    "in  [ sec : method ] we describe our adopted model for the mass distribution of the mw halo .",
    "we then calculate the past lmc orbit (  [ sec : const ] ) and the effect of m31 on it (  [ sec : m31 ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "following b07 , we adopt a navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ; hereafter nfw ) mass profile for the dark matter distribution in the mw halo , and include dynamical friction ( chandrasekhar 1943 , hashimoto 2003 ) in calculating the lmc motion through the mw halo .",
    "we also add the gravitational potential of m31 in the form of another nfw profile at a present - day galactocentric distance of 780 kpc ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2005 ; cox & loeb 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "the full gravitational potential @xmath8 as a function of radius @xmath9 in each galaxy ( either mw or m31 ) includes contributions from a disk ( @xmath10 ) , a bulge ( @xmath11 ) , and a dark matter halo ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 where ( xue et al .",
    "2008 ) @xmath14 with @xmath15    we adopt the standard @xmath16cdm cosmological parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( komatsu et al . 2008 ) , and an overdensity of @xmath19 ( wechsler et al 2002 ; klypin , zhao , & somerville 2002 ) , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "some of our initial conditions ( e.g. ,  and ) depend on the distance of the sun from the center of the mw galaxy , as will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : const ] , but we consistently adopt @xmath22 , @xmath23 , a disk scale length @xmath24 , a disk scale height @xmath25 , and a halo concentration @xmath26 for the mw ; and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath26 for m31 , as suggested by klypin et al . ( 2002 ) . aside from the revised normalization of  and  based on the modified value of , we have used the same mass profile as b07 .",
    "previous calculations of the history of the lmc have adopted the iau standard values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as derived by kerr & lynden - bell ( 1986 ; hereafter klb86 ) .",
    "these values assume the angular velocity of circular rotation for the sun to be @xmath35 .",
    "rb04 directly measured this value from the proper motion of sgr a * to be @xmath36 , which using @xmath37 ( reid 1993 ) implies @xmath38 . based on the observed orbits of individual stars around sgr a * , ghez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and gge08 measured the distance of the sun from the mw center to be @xmath39 , assuming that sgr a * is at rest . these latest measurements are similar to the value inferred by klb86 , and bring the maximum  ( within 1-@xmath40 ) up to 265 , which is @xmath41% higher than the 220   on which all prior studies were based . calculations based solely on klb86 are therefore at the lower end ( 2-@xmath40 below ) of the allowed values for , , and .",
    "the new values are listed in table [ tab : mvr ] .",
    "the inferred masses and radii assume the commonly accepted value of @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the values of @xmath44 ( corresponding to galactic coordinates x , y , z ) were all calculated using the standard method of vdm02 , changing only the value of .",
    "while all of the recalculated masses are consistent with various recent measurements , the circular velocity of 251  , corresponding to = @xmath45 , gives the minimum value of the virial mass that is consistent with the timing argument , which puts the total mass of the local group ( lg ) between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( binney & tremaine 1987 , hereafter bt87 ; van der marel & guhathakurta 2008 , hereafter vdmg08 ; li & white 2008 ) .",
    "the mw and m31 galaxies dominate the lg and are of comparable masses ; a combined mass of @xmath48@xmath49 is on the lower end of the timing argument estimate .",
    "li & white ( 2008 ) , using the millennium simulation and data on leo i , find the most likely mass for mw halo to be @xmath50 with a lower limit of @xmath51 , giving a more than adequate range to acommodate our inferred masses .",
    "additional mass estimates of the mw halo are found in table [ tab : mw ] and discussed further in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "@xmath52frc denotes a flat rotation curve , as in an isothermal sphere .",
    "these mass calculations have cutoffs of @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54e.g . the millennium simulation . here",
    "the limiting radius is the virial radius , similar to the nfw calculation .",
    "the @xmath55 increase in mass ( from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) and the @xmath58 decrease in the velocity of the lmc ( p08(220  ) to p08(251  ) ) have a comparable influence on making lmc orbit bound to the mw .",
    "the combined effect of these changes is not equivalent to a change in the mw mass , as considered by b07 .",
    "the k06(251  ) and p08(220  ) lines in figures [ fig : distance2 ] and [ fig : distance ] correspond to roughly the same lmc velocity ( as derived from the iau standard with the p08 proper motion ) but a different mw mass .",
    "the higher mass of the mw contributes about half of the overall difference between these cases .",
    "this parallels the comparison made in b07 between the k06(220  ) and the k06(220  ) @xmath59 numbers in their _ fiducial _ and _ high mass _ models , except that our findings do not require a @xmath60 deviation from the measured lmc velocity or a @xmath61 deviation from the mass of the mw in order to make the lmc orbit bound to the mw .",
    "the previous suggestion ( b07 ) of possibly disqualifying the lmc and smc as mw satellites has undesirable implications for the satellites in the mw halo .",
    "m31 has 18 satellites , 5 of which are gas rich , whereas the mw , if the lmc and smc are no longer bound to it , has only 12 bound satellites , 2 of which are gas rich ( karachentsev 2005 , vdmg08 ) .",
    "m31 s satellites range in mass from 0.58 to 500 @xmath62 , whereas the remaining mw satellites are in the range of 0.11@xmath62 ( mateo 1998 ) . excluding the lmc and smc as satellites of the mw appears unnatural , as there is no reason for the two comparably sized galaxies to have a large disparity in the abundance of massive satellites .",
    "moreover , the chance of finding massive galaxies like the lmc and the smc so close to the mw center requires a special coincidence if they are unbound to the mw , since they would have spent most of their orbital time far away from the mw in that case . yet",
    ", no similar galaxies are known to exist in the much larger volume between m31 and the mw .",
    "although these statistical arguments are not definitive , they support indirectly the higher updated values of ( rb04 ) and ( gge08 ) for the mw",
    ".    no work on the magellanic clouds would be complete without a mention of the magellanic stream ( ms ) .",
    "there is @xmath63 change in the trajectory over the length of the ms ( 100 degrees ) between the p08(220 ) and the p08(251 ) models , both of which are well within the error margins in figure 8 of b07 .",
    "we reiterate the concerns presented in b07 that neither tidal stripping nor ram pressure can fully explain the orientation of the stream .    *",
    "* we thank gurtina besla and mark reid for useful discussions .",
