    "the spatial resolution in optical scanning microscopy is critically dependent on both the beam spot size near the focus of a scanning objective lens and how the focal spot is imaged back onto an imaging plane . in order to achieve the ultimate resolution the beam spot size at focus",

    "otherwise , the spatial resolution is degraded and it can not be recovered however well one handles the imaging of the focal spot . for proper accessing the minimal focal beam spot , one should be able to calculate and measure the beam spot size accurately .    in many experiments using an objective lens",

    "we re - examine the diffraction theory of richards and wolf for input gaussian beams . in two limiting cases of very small and very large input beam widths , we derive approximate formula for the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the intensity distribution at focus in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",

    "<S> approximate formulae for full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the intensity distribution at focus were derived for very large and very small initial beam waists with respect to the entrance pupil radius of the objective lens . in experiments </S>",
    "<S> the energy flux through a 0.5 micron pinhole was measured for various pinhole positions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the fwhm s at focus in the transverse and the longitudinal directions do not increase much from the ultimate fwhm s until the input beam waist is reduced below the half of the entrance pupil radius . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observed significance of the spatial distribution of the input beam against a true gaussian beam profile in the case of small initial beam waist . for high na with resulting focal beam waists comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of the laser , the interaction between the electric field and the conducting surface of the pinhole caused the transverse fwhm to be measured slightly smaller than fwhm of the unperturbed intensity distribution convoluted with the pinhole opening . </S>"
