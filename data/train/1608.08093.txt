    "<S> figures  [ fig : momentum ] ( a ) and ( d ) show closer agreement with the momentum densities predicted by the rmt method @xcite . at the same time , the overall forward - backward asymmetry along the @xmath53 direction ( for @xmath54 and @xmath52 ) is generally unaffected , since this characteristic depends on the symmetry of the laser field only .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : angle ] shows photoelectron angular distributions for f@xmath0 for a four - cycle pulse with cep @xmath55 , wavelengths 1300 and 1800  nm and intensities of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58  w/@xmath49 . because of the errors mentioned earlier , these angular distributions are very different , both in shape and magnitude , from the ( incorrect ) results in fig . 5 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory structure of the distributions is related to the minimum number of photons that needs to be absorbed near the peak of the pulse , @xmath59 ( determined by the integer part of @xmath60 for a given ponderomotive energy @xmath61 ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : angle ] ( a ) , ( d ) and ( f ) corresponding to @xmath63 , 9 and 11 , respectively , and in contrast to the original ( incorrect ) results of @xcite where a central minimum for odd @xmath59 was noted . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of channel closure with increasing intensity gives rise to even @xmath59=6 , 6 and 10 and a minimum at @xmath64 , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angle ] ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is in agreement with the observation that for a long periodic pulse the @xmath65-photon detachment rate is exactly zero at @xmath66 for odd @xmath67 @xcite , and the fact that @xmath47 dominates the photoelectron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : angle ] also indicates that electron emission at angles close to the direction of the field ( i.e. , within @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) is much stronger here in comparison to ref .  </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : anglecep ] displays the angular distributions computed for cep values @xmath70 and @xmath52 , and corrects fig .  6 or ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the shapes are very different , the degree of asymmetry on the angular distributions for these cep values is consistent with that seen in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : energy ] presents the photoelectron energy spectra for a four - cycle pulse with @xmath50 and the same wavelengths and intensities as in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 7 of ref .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we see that the shapes and magnitudes of the correct spectra are quite different from those reported in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the spectra shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy ] ( c ) and ( f ) ( corresponding to intensity @xmath58  </S>",

    "<S> .total detachment probabilities for photodetachment of f@xmath0 calculated for a four - cycle pulse at wavelengths 1300 and 1800  nm , and different peak intensities @xmath71 and cep phases @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the last column shows the detachment probabilities per period for a long pulse . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for completeness , table  [ tab : totalprobf ] gives the total detachment probability for f@xmath0 for all wavelengths and intensities considered , with cep values @xmath5=0 and @xmath51 ( @xmath72 and @xmath51 give equivalent results ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown above , correct phases of the terms in the amplitude are crucial for the shapes of the photoelectron momentum , angular and energy distributions . however , they play a relatively small role in the total detachment probability </S>",
    "<S> . we have checked that if the latter is calculated by omitting the @xmath45 factor in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : glebshort ] ) , the total detachment probability is within 1 - 2% of the values given in table  [ tab : totalprobf ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the total detachment probability obtained by neglecting the interference terms [ i.e. , by adding the modulus - squared values of the individual saddle - point contributions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : glebshort ] ) ] , @xmath73 , is within few per cent of the correct value . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the interference of the photoelectron wave packets produced at different laser - field maxima does not lead to much suppression of enhancement of electron emission , but only to some spatial redistribution of the photoelectron flux . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath73 shown in the second last column of table  [ tab : totalprobf ] are also practically independent of the cep ( with differences @xmath74 ) .    shown in the last column of table  [ tab : totalprobf ] are the detachment probabilities _ per period _ determined from the kta detachment rates in a long periodic pulse , @xmath75 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are close to the detachment probabilities in the four - cycle pulse , which implies that effectively , the detachment in the four - cycle pulse is dominated by the central , strongest - field cycle . </S>",
    "<S> a similar agreement was seen in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( table ii ) which compared detachment probabilities of h@xmath0 in a five - cycle pulse with the corresponding one - period long - pulse probabilities from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    additionally , it is interesting to note that the total detachment probabilities in the short pulse are slightly greater for @xmath76 than for @xmath50 if @xmath59 is odd , but slightly smaller when @xmath59 is even . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is entirely due to intereference . </S>",
    "<S> it can be explained by the fact that for @xmath76 the time - dependent electric field @xmath77 acquires its maximum peak magnitude twice within two central half - cycles , whereas for @xmath50 the field reaches its peak value once at the middle of the pulse . by comparing the angular distributions ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angle ] and [ fig : anglecep ] ) for odd and even @xmath59 we see that for @xmath76 , constructive interference is more prominent for odd @xmath59 near the @xmath66 direction relative to the field , while for even @xmath59 , destructive interference is more pronounced for angles near @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives slightly higher ( lower ) total detachment probabilities seen in table  [ tab : totalprobf ] for @xmath76 when @xmath59 is odd ( even ) .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the photoelectron spectra presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were incorrect , in part due to the omission of the @xmath9-dependent phase factor in the sum over the saddle points that gives the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> using the correct phase factor is crucial for obtaining correct interference features of the photoelectron momentum and angular distributions . </S>"
