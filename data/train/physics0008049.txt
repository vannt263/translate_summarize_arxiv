    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique which is based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the nonlinear beam / accelerator physics problems described by some forms of vlasov - maxwell ( poisson ) equations .",
    "such approach may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related with statistical distributions to the problems described by systems of nonlinear ordinary / partial differential equations .",
    "wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us the possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and gives for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases the maximum sparse forms .",
    "our approach in this paper is based on the generalization of variational - wavelet approach from [ 1]-[8 ] , which allows us to consider not only polynomial but rational type of nonlinearities [ 9 ] .",
    "the solution has the following form ( related forms in part 3 ) @xmath0 which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all time / space scales .",
    "formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into the slow part @xmath1 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary n. so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process .",
    "the first term in the rhs of formulae ( 1 ) corresponds on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second one to detail space . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time / space scale .",
    "the same is correct for the contribution to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contributions from each level / scale of resolution .",
    "starting in part 2 from vlasov - maxwell equations we consider in part 3 the generalization of our approach based on variational formulation in the biorthogonal bases of compactly supported wavelets .",
    "analysis based on the non - linear vlasov - maxwell equations leds to more clear understanding of the collective effects and nonlinear beam dynamics of high intensity beam propagation in periodic - focusing and uniform - focusing transport systems .",
    "we consider the following form of equations ( [ 11 ] for setup and designation ) : @xmath2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'}-\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big[k_y(s)y+\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}\\big]\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y ' }    \\big\\ } f_b=0 , \\\\ & & \\big(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\big)\\psi= -\\frac{2\\pi k_b}{n_b}\\int { \\mathrm{d}}x ' { \\mathrm{d}}y ' f_b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding hamiltonian for transverse single - particle motion is given by @xmath3+\\psi(x , y , s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    related vlasov system describes longitudinal dynamics of high energy stored beam [ 12 ] :    @xmath4",
    "now we consider some useful generalization of our variational wavelet approach .",
    "because integrand of variational functionals is represented by bilinear form ( scalar product ) it seems more reasonable to consider wavelet constructions [ 13 ] which take into account all advantages of this structure .",
    "the action functional for loops in the phase space is @xmath5 the critical points of @xmath6 are those loops @xmath7 , which solve the hamiltonian equations associated with the hamiltonian @xmath8 and hence are periodic orbits .",
    "let us consider the loop space @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , of smooth loops in @xmath11 .",
    "let us define a function @xmath12 by setting @xmath13 computing the derivative at @xmath14 in the direction of @xmath15 , we find @xmath16 consequently , @xmath17 for all @xmath15 iff the loop @xmath18 is a solution of the hamiltonian equations .",
    "now we need to take into account underlying bilinear structure via wavelets .",
    "we started with two hierarchical sequences of approximations spaces [ 13 ] : @xmath19 @xmath20 and as usually , @xmath21 is complement to @xmath22 in @xmath23 , but now not necessarily orthogonal complement .",
    "new orthogonality conditions have now the following form : @xmath24 translates of @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 , translates of @xmath28 .",
    "biorthogonality conditions are @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "functions @xmath31 form dual pair : @xmath32 functions @xmath33 generate a multiresolution analysis .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 are synthesis functions , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are analysis functions .",
    "synthesis functions are biorthogonal to analysis functions .",
    "scaling spaces are orthogonal to dual wavelet spaces .",
    "two multiresolutions are intertwining @xmath38 .",
    "these are direct sums but not orthogonal sums .",
    "so , our representation for solution has now the form @xmath39 where synthesis wavelets are used to synthesize the function .",
    "but @xmath40 come from inner products with analysis wavelets .",
    "biorthogonality yields @xmath41",
    "so , now we can introduce this more useful construction into our variational approach .",
    "we have modification only on the level of computing coefficients of reduced nonlinear algebraical system .",
    "this new construction is more flexible .",
    "biorthogonal point of view is more stable under the action of large class of operators while orthogonal ( one scale for multiresolution ) is fragile , all computations are much more simpler and we accelerate the rate of convergence . in all types of ( hamiltonian ) calculation , which are based on some bilinear structures ( symplectic or poissonian structures , bilinear form of integrand in variational integral ) this framework leads to greater success .",
    "so , we try to use wavelet bases with their good spatial and scale  wavenumber localization properties to explore the dynamics of coherent structures in spatially - extended , turbulent/stochastic systems .",
    "after some ansatzes and reductions we arrive from ( 2),(3 ) or ( 5)-(7 ) to some system of nonlinear partial differential equations [ 10 ] .",
    "we consider application of our technique to kuramoto - sivashiinsky equation as a model with rich spatio - temporal behaviour [ 14 ] ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 let be @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are both wavelets .",
    "+ variational formulation @xmath50 reduces ( 13 ) to ode and algebraical one .",
    "@xmath51 in particular case on @xmath52 we have : @xmath53 \\left(\\begin{array}{l } a_0\\\\ a_1\\\\ a_2 \\end{array } \\right)+\\ ] ] @xmath54 then in contrast to [ 14 ] we apply to ( 16 ) methods from [ 1]-[9 ] and arrive to formula ( 1 ) . the same approach we use for the general nonlinear wave equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 according to [ 2],[10 ] we may consider it as infinite dimensional hamiltonian systems with phase space @xmath57 on @xmath58 $ ] and coordinates : @xmath59 , then @xmath60 then anzatzes : @xmath61 and methods [ 1]-[10 ] led to formulae ( 1 ) . resulting multiresolution / multiscale representation in the high - localized bases ( fig.1 ) is demonstrated on fig.2 , fig.3 .",
