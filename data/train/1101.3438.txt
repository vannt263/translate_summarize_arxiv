    "last year we presented the local explicit form of the _ second - order symmetric _ ( or _ @xmath0nd symmetric _ for short ) spacetimes in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the techniques used for that purpose were specific of the dimension .",
    "our aim now is to introduce new techniques that generalize the result to arbitrary dimension . recall that @xmath0nd symmetric spacetimes are characterized by the condition @xmath1 they were introduced by one of the authors in @xcite as the simplest natural generalization of the _ locally symmetric _ spacetimes ( those satisfying @xmath2 ) . in the riemannian @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and lorentzian @xcite cases ,",
    "the locally symmetric spaces are well known .",
    "however , @xmath0nd symmetric spaces have been hardly considered in the literature , probably because the local de rham decomposition implies that @xmath0nd symmetry and local symmetry are equivalent in the proper riemannian case @xcite,@xcite . in the lorentzian case such decomposition fails @xcite , and so does the equivalence .",
    "thus , even though in arbitrary signature _ semi - symmetric _ spaces ( those satisfying @xmath3 } r^\\alpha~_{\\beta\\lambda\\mu}=0 $ ] , see for example @xcite,@xcite for the riemannian case and @xcite , @xcite for the lorentzian one ) have always been regarded as the simple natural generalization of the locally symmetric ones , in indefinite signatures the @xmath0nd symmetry is a simpler natural choice .    in this contribution",
    "we announce the following classification of _ proper @xmath0nd symmetric _ spacetimes ( here proper means that they are not locally symmetric , that is @xmath4 ) in arbitrary dimension @xcite :    [ lem4 ] a @xmath5-dimensional proper @xmath0nd symmetric spacetime @xmath6 is locally isometric to a product spacetime @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a non - flat riemannian symmetric space and @xmath9 is a generalized cahen - wallach space of order @xmath0 , defined as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) endowed with the metric @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the cartesian coordinates of @xmath14 , each function @xmath15 is affine , i.e. , @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "if in addition @xmath19 is geodesically complete and simply connected , then @xmath19 is globally isometric to one of such products .",
    "as in the four - dimensional case , the starting point for the proof is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 ) , which states when , in the lorentzian case , the @xmath0nd symmetry condition does not imply local symmetry .",
    "this can only happen when the spacetime possesses a null ( non - vanishing ) covariantly constant vector field .",
    "therefore , it is locally isometric to a brinkmann spacetime , whose metric can be written in an appropiate _ brinkmann chart _ @xmath13 as @xcite,@xcite : @xmath20where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions independent of @xmath24 , otherwise arbitrary . with",
    "this data at hand , the steps of the proof are the following :    1 .",
    "[ 1 ] a suitable choice of vector field basis simplifies the computation of the equations of @xmath0nd symmetry .",
    "2 .   [ 2 ] as a first consequence , the leaves of the foliation @xmath25 generated by the submanifolds with constant values of @xmath26 and @xmath24 are locally symmetric riemannian manifolds for any brinkmann chart .",
    "3 .   using the integrability equations and ( [ 2 ] ) , one proves that the only non - vanishing components of the curvature in the basis ( [ 1 ] ) are @xmath27 .",
    "4 .   applying a generalization of the eisenhart theorem @xcite , ``",
    "the spatial part '' @xmath28 is splits into two parts , one of them is ricci - flat which , on using a result in @xcite , becomes actually flat .",
    "5 .   after lengthy computations",
    ", one can prove that there exists a brinkmann chart such that the metric becomes : @xmath29 with @xmath30 6 .   at this stage ,",
    "the equations can be reorganized in two blocks : * one corresponding to the equations of local symmetry , whose solutions are already known @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , * the other one corresponding to the equations of @xmath0nd symmetry for a plane wave , which are easily solvable .    to develop the proof , the introduction of some mathematical tools is required , namely :    1 .",
    "some operators defined on the tensor bundle @xmath31 , denoted as @xmath32 ( transverse operator ) and @xmath33 ( which arises from the covariant derivative on the leaves ) , and an adaptation of the exterior derivative to @xmath25 .",
    "the curvature tensor @xmath34 associated intrinsically to the foliation ( i.e. , to @xmath33 ) , as well as its naturally associated ricci tensor @xmath35 and scalar curvature @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   some tensor fields on @xmath25 defined as projections of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as well as some algebraic lemmas on vector spaces with positive definite inner product .",
    "an appropriate adaptation of the eisenhart theorem to brinkmann spacetimes , as mentioned above .",
    "this involves the operators @xmath32 and @xmath39 and ensures the reducibility of the entire family of metrics @xmath28 which depend on @xmath26 simultaneously .    before dealing with the global part of the proof",
    ", we define    * _ proper @xmath40-th symmetric _ spacetimes as those satisfying @xmath41 but @xmath42 , * the generalized _ cahen - wallach spacetimes of order @xmath40 _ , denoted by @xmath43 , as the spacetimes @xmath44 , @xmath45 with metric @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a square symmetric matrix of dimension @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , and each @xmath50 is a square symmetric matrix of constants , @xmath51 .",
    "observe that these spacetimes are proper @xmath40th symmetric @xcite , as well as analytic and geodesically complete @xcite .",
    "then , the global result follows directly from :    for any matrix @xmath52 as above :    * the direct product of @xmath53 and a finite number of riemannian symmetric ( non - necessarily simply connected ) spaces is a proper @xmath40-th symmetric lorentzian manifold , which is in fact geodesically complete and analytic , and * if a complete lorentzian manifold @xmath6 is locally isometric to spaces of the form given above , then its universal covering is also of this type .",
    "the techniques used to solve the arbitrary dimensional case differ from the techniques used in four dimensions since in the latter case the petrov classification of the weyl tensor @xcite was used .",
    "such classification is not available in arbitrary dimension with the same simplicity , though some generalizations have already apeared in the literature ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we had to refocuse the problem in arbitrary dimension using a different , and more powerful , viewpoint .",
