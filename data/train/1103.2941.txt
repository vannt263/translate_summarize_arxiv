    "the notions of quantum liquids and their instabilities are paradigmatic for condensed matter physics  @xcite . for multicomponent fluids , an important set of instabilities is associated with interactions between components .",
    "a classic example is the cooper instability of a spin-@xmath0 fermi liquid  : even an infinitesimal attractive coupling between fermions of opposite spins drives a phase transition into the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer superconductor  @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) counterpart of the fermi liquid , the spinful luttinger liquid , has a similar instability , where an attractive inter - spin coupling opens a gap in the spin channel  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the bulk of the discussion on two - species liquids assumed the su(2 ) spin symmetry .",
    "the recent years have witnessed a growing availability of experimental studies of mixtures of unlike particles .",
    "this includes loading ultracold atoms to spin - dependent optical lattices  @xcite , and trapping atoms of different masses  @xcite or even different statistics  @xcite .",
    "while most of experimental progress so far is in the domain of ultracold atoms , we stress that the relevance of such _ asymmetric _ mixtures is not confined to the realm of cold gases  : dealing with more traditional solid state systems , one faces an asymmetric mixture situation as soon as the fermi level spans several bands ( which _ a priori _ need not be equivalent ) .",
    "this setup is typical for such diverse materials as semi - metallic compounds , mixed - valence materials , organic superconductors  @xcite , small radius nanotubes @xcite , and even graphene - based heterostructures  @xcite",
    ".    a generic question immediately arises  : given a two - component mixture , what is the role of ( the lack of ) su(2 ) symmetry ? or , more precisely , does the symmetry between components limit the set of instabilities of a liquid ? clearly , the answer might depend on the universality class of the liquid , and on the particular way the symmetry is broken .",
    "the simplest albeit non - trivial way of breaking the symmetry is to assume species - dependent masses of the particles .",
    "even if we consider the few - body problem , this is known to bring new physics like the efimov phenomenon  : while for an equal - mass fermi liquid the only allowed bound state is a cooper pair , three - body bound states ( trimers ) appear once the mass ratio exceeds a certain threshold  @xcite .",
    "the atom - dimer scattering is strongly affected by the mass asymmetry  @xcite and the ultimate fate of a fermi liquid in presence of the efimov effect is currently an open question being actively investigated  @xcite .",
    "all these theoretical considerations are strongly motivated by cold - atom experiments which have recently achieved degeneracy of fermi gases with different masses  @xcite and spin - imbalanced two - component fermionic gases  @xcite .",
    "the physics of 1d quantum many - body systems offers powerful methods  @xcite , both analytical and numerical , to have quantitative predictions on the fate of the luttinger liquid in the presence of perturbations .",
    "the role of mass asymmetry for a two - component luttinger liquid has been investigated in the renormalization group ( rg ) framework originally in the context of solid state physics  @xcite , and recently revisited mostly in the context of cold atoms  @xcite , and supplemented by numerical investigations  @xcite .",
    "overall the consensus was that the only new instability arising due to asymmetry is the collapse ( demixing ) instability for large asymmetry and/or strong interspecies attraction ( repulsion ) .",
    "recently , a novel family of instabilities was predicted  @xcite to exist due to the interplay between _ polarization and asymmetry _  : these instabilities only take place for _ polarized _ mixtures of either statistics , and are characterized by the locking of the ratio of the densities to a _ rational _ value .",
    "subsequent work in ref .   elucidated the relation of these instabilities and existence of few - body bound states . a qualitative picture of the mode - locking mechanism and the strong - coupling limit of the trimer formation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : trimers ] .",
    "the latter regime recalls another approach to multi - particle bound - states which is the use of many - colors ( @xmath1-component ) fermions  @xcite with which the physics of the trimers share qualitative features .",
    "this paper is divided in two main parts : the first one investigates in detail the bosonization approach and the mode - locking mechanism mentioned above , while the second is dedicated to the specific but important example of the 1d asymmetric hubbard model using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the first part account for most of the numerical data , but a more phenomenological bose - fermi picture is proposed as a complementary analysis .",
    "other important questions such as the effect of a trapping potential or the emergence of crystal phases are eventually addressed .",
    "in this section , we describe the salient features of the effective bosonic field theory appropriate to a 1d mixture of two distinct fermionic ( or bosonic ) atoms .",
    "the aim of this section is to give a bosonization interpretation for the formation of few - body bound states and their effective behavior through a mode - locking mechanism between the two species .",
    "predictions on the nature of the resulting phase are then made .",
    "the theory is a priori valid for models in the continuum or the continuous version of lattice models at generic ( i.e. non - commensurate ) densities .",
    "the effects of the presence of the lattice on certain commensurate densities will be briefly discussed in section  [ sec : lattice ] .",
    "notation conventions are standard and taken from ref .  .",
    "the two species are labeled by a pseudo - spin index @xmath2 and their corresponding densities @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is the total density .",
    "each species can be described by a scalar field @xmath5 and its dual @xmath6 .",
    "the creation operators can be expressed as a function of these fields , with , for fermions @xmath7 and , for bosons , @xmath8 we have included all higher harmonics : as a consequence , the summation is over all integers  @xcite .",
    "the `` fermi momenta '' , @xmath9 are a priori not equal to each other , corresponding to a spin - imbalanced situation . the density operators @xmath10 read @xmath11 the effective low - energy hamiltonian can be written in terms of the fields @xmath5 and their canonically conjugate momentum @xmath12 . in the case of absence of inter - species interactions",
    "the effective bosonic theory is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14\\ ; , \\label{h0}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the sound velocity and @xmath16 the so - called luttinger parameter , which is equal to one in the free fermions or free hard - core bosons cases .",
    "taking into account density - density interactions between species , of the generic form @xmath17 , changes the effective theory and brings new kinds of terms : zero - momentum terms in the density representation couples the two spin species through a bilinear operator @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a forward scattering constant , and higher harmonics terms involving multiples of the spatial frequencies @xmath20 : @xmath21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are non - universal coupling constants .",
    "clearly , if the generalized commensurability condition @xmath23 is satisfied ( with @xmath24 and @xmath25 coprime integers ) , and provided these terms are relevant , they will tend to lock the up and down fields together .",
    "when the densities are fine - tuned to the definite commensurability , then all other cosine operators in the sum are oscillating , in which case they do nt contribute in the continuum limit ( or they are less relevant for multiples of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the remaining important operator in the sum is thus the sine - gordon term @xmath26 with the combination @xmath27 for attractive interactions @xmath28 ( we will argue below that this choice favors the relevance of the term ) , energy will be minimized when the field is pinned to @xmath29 .",
    "notice again that the above argument on the mode - locking mechanism does not rely on the presence of a lattice .",
    "lastly , the cosine locks a combination of the bosonic modes but at a generic total density @xmath30 , there remains another bosonic mode leaving the full excitation spectrum gapless .",
    "we will see that the latter describes the effective behavior of the bound - states . in the following ,",
    "we dub @xmath31 this massless bosonic mode .",
    "we can draw a last remark on the operators : they have high scaling dimensions near the free fermion fixed point and are expected to be irrelevant apart from some special circumstances which are the object of this work . in the fermionic language , they involve @xmath32-body interactions of the form : @xmath33 where the summation over @xmath34 runs over all combinations of @xmath35 momenta due to the total momentum conservation law  : @xmath36 .",
    "such interactions appear at high order in perturbation theory in a hubbard model for example or after several steps of a rg treatment . for practical purposes",
    "it is simpler to work with the bosonic formulation given by eq .  , and",
    "this is what we do from now on .    in the following , we assume that the densities are commensurate via the condition , and analyze the simplified effective theory written in terms of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 fields @xmath39 where the velocities @xmath15 and luttinger parameters @xmath16 are determined by the intra - species interactions",
    ". the quadratic part @xmath40 can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation  @xcite which could give a starting point for a perturbative rg calculation  @xcite . due to the velocity asymmetry ,",
    "additional couplings are generated and velocities are renormalized along the flow .",
    "the discussion of the nature of the gapped phases and their correlations remains unclear .",
    "in particular , diagonalizing the quadratic part @xmath41 of the hamiltonian does not give , apart from special choice of the parameters , the combination that appears in the cosine term @xmath42 .",
    "in the next section , we take the following strategy : we look for the conditions under which the quadratic part and the cosine term are simultaneously diagonalizable . at the price of a restriction on the parameters",
    "range , the analysis can be done safely both for the criteria of relevance of the cosine and for the correlation functions in the single - mode phase . in spite of the limitation of the approach",
    ", we believe the scenario does occur without this restriction : as shown numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : trimers ] on a realistic model , the single - mode multimer phase can span a wide region of the phase diagram .",
    "lastly , we notice that , similarly to the phase separation criteria in two - component mixtures ( when one of the mode velocities vanishes ) , the single - mode phase will undergo a phase separation instability when the gapless mode velocity @xmath43 vanishes .",
    "we thus expect to find the single - mode phase surrounded with the two - mode phase and a demixed phase .",
    "we have qualitatively discussed the fact that the physics should generically be described by two fields @xmath44 where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the one entering in the cosine term . in general ,",
    "it is hard to have a complete form for the transformation between the @xmath44 and the @xmath47 .",
    "such a transformation is important both for the rg analysis and the calculation of physical correlators which are naturally expressed in terms of the @xmath48 fields .",
    "below , we discuss a special case where the transformation can be performed and its range of validity .    the simplest transformation , and yet rather general , one can work with is a linear combination of the fields with coefficients that are independent of the position  : @xmath49 when @xmath50 , excitations corresponding to the eigenmodes @xmath51 carry both spin and charge modes which are respectively the sum and the difference of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 modes .",
    "as the transformation must preserve the commutation relations @xmath52 & = i\\pi\\delta_{\\sigma\\sigma ' } \\delta(x - x ' ) \\,,\\\\ [    \\phi_{\\sigma}(x ) , \\nabla \\theta_{\\sigma'}(x ' ) ] & = i\\pi\\delta_{\\sigma\\sigma ' } \\delta(x - x ' ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we get that @xmath53 .",
    "then , we have @xmath54 with the determinant @xmath55 in a shortened version , we have @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the matrix of the @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath57 is unitary , the @xmath60 and the @xmath61 undergo the same transformation .",
    "we now impose that @xmath62 which gives @xmath63 as we want to cancel the cross - terms in eq .",
    ", we require that  : @xmath64 which can be rewritten as  : @xmath65 there exists a non - zero solution only if the condition  : @xmath66 is satisfied .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , we have a one - parameter family of transformations with the desirable property of having only one eigenmode in the argument of the cosine operator .",
    "the parameter is just the choice of scale of the field @xmath31  : in 1d , we can change the scale of the bose field provided we change accordingly its luttinger parameter @xmath67 . here , we choose the scale of @xmath31 so that  : @xmath68    the condition strongly reduces the range of applicability of the transformation : for a given coupling @xmath19 , the luttinger parameters and velocities of each species must satisfy the above relation .",
    "when the transformation can be used , splits into a free boson field for @xmath69 and a sine - gordon model for @xmath70 : @xmath71 with @xmath72 . in this case ,",
    "the new velocities and luttinger parameters associated with the @xmath73 modes are given by the following relations  : @xmath74 where we have defined  : @xmath75 with our definition of @xmath76 and provided the sine - gordon description is applicable , the requirement for the cosine to be relevant , and thus to enter the single - mode phase , is simply @xmath77 one qualitatively observes that a velocity much smaller than the other favors a small @xmath78 and that large attractive interactions @xmath79 will help increase @xmath80 and reduce @xmath78 . in the following ,",
    "we consider limiting cases in which the discussion simplifies in order to identify how the parameters would favor the formation of a gap in the @xmath70 sector .",
    "the limit @xmath81 ( attained with attractive interactions ) signals the transition to the phase - separated or falicov - kimball regime from the multimer phase .",
    "when @xmath82 , the condition imposes that either ( i ) @xmath83 or ( ii ) @xmath84 .",
    "the transformation and new velocities and luttinger parameters then take a simple form : in case ( i ) , we have @xmath85 and  : @xmath86 while in case ( ii ) , we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 in both cases , having @xmath89 would require a very small @xmath90 ( assuming @xmath91 for example ) .",
    "this could be realized with long - range intra - species interactions but may not be easily achievable .",
    "notice a peculiarity of the formula for the massive mode @xmath31 in : while @xmath92 and @xmath93 are length - scale dependent ( in the rg sense ) , the expression in holds on all length - scales .      in order to identify the influence of the velocities ratio on @xmath78",
    ", one can introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . then , and are rewritten as @xmath97 if one takes into account only , @xmath78 vanishes in the limit of large velocity ratio @xmath98 or @xmath99 and passes through a maximum in between so that there are two windows of @xmath100 such that @xmath89 .",
    "the smaller the maximum , the wider these windows are so , clearly , negative and large interactions ( @xmath101 ) favor the mode - locking mechanism . yet , imposes another constraint and we just consider the @xmath102 limit for simplicity . there",
    ", this limit is possible provided @xmath103 , i.e. in the case of attractive interaction only . as a consequence , this analysis shows that we should expect the formation of multimer in the attractive and large interaction regime , favored by large asymmetry .",
    "deep in the massive-@xmath70 phase , one can make a crude quadratic approximation to the cosine operator in by replacing it with a mass term @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to approximate expressions for the velocity and luttinger parameter of the remaining mode  @xmath69  : @xmath105 which reduces to the correct result for equal velocities .      in one - dimensional models ,",
    "the classification of the groundstates is determined by their dominant correlations .",
    "one can break discrete symmetries ( for instance translational symmetry on a lattice model ) but order parameters associated with continuous symmetries are always zero .",
    "the naming of a phase then corresponds to the connected equal - time correlator with the slowest decay in space .",
    "quite generally , these correlators are asymptotically decaying either algebraically or exponentially .",
    "such algebraic correlations are usually referred to as a quasi long - range order ( qlro ) . the slowest decay ( or smallest exponent of algebraic correlations )",
    "criteria is based on a rpa argument by considering a set of weakly coupled luttinger liquids  @xcite which shows that order will build up provided the exponent of the correlator is smaller than two , and that the main instability is associated with the smallest exponent .",
    "however , if the green s function , associated with @xmath106 which is not an order parameter , has the slowest decaying exponent , a rg analysis shows that coupling the luttinger liquids yield a fermi liquid phase ( provided that the decay exponent is smaller than two again ) .",
    "if all physical correlators are exponentially decaying ( apart from the density one which always keep , at least , a quadratic decay ) , the term liquid is often used .",
    "this approach yet remains phenomenological as the higher - dimension situation and is much more involved .    in this section ,",
    "we follow the standard practice and consider the correlation functions of various observables to discuss the nature of the phases that are realized in the single - mode and two - mode regimes .",

    "our goal is only to exhibit some parameters for which the trimer phase is stabilized and to give some qualitative comments .",
    "the trapping potential is taken into account by adding the quadratic term @xmath322 to eq .",

    "[ fig : phasediagu ] , the trimer phase is likely to be found at small enough densities and not too small @xmath210 to prevent the occurrence of the fk regime .",
    "however , we find that the average density of the trapped system is strongly dependent on the hamiltonian parameters . at fixed number of particles @xmath1 and trap size @xmath323 , changing @xmath202 and @xmath210 strongly affects the radius of the cloud and the density in the middle .",

    "[ fig : trapped]*(b ) * , the pairing and trimer correlations are strongly different from that of a superfluid phase : we have dominating trimer correlations and exponential pairing correlations as in the homogeneous counterpart . in agreement with a lda picture ,",
    "since we have seen that @xmath154 decreases with density , the trimer correlations are boosted at long distances .",
    "similarly , the pairing correlations decrease slightly faster then an exponential close to the edge of the cloud .",
    "these results are encouraging in the perspective of a possible achievement of the trimer phase in actual experiments .",

    "[ sec : lattice ] , a crystalline phase of trimers can occur in this lattice model when the total density @xmath30 is commensurate .",
    "evidence of this scenario together with a phase diagram for @xmath252 has been proposed in ref .   in the case of a mixture of two - component bosons , for large enough asymmetry . as",
    "the order parameter ( the density ) associated with this transition is independent of the statistics , we expect a similar scenario ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] ) and a similar location of the transition in the fermionic version of the model under study .",
    "indeed , we give in fig .  [",
    "fig : crystal ] an example of the crystal phase .",

    "we have not investigated the extension of the phase which should rather be small on the scale of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagu ] and its neighboring phases which could be either the two - mode ll or the trimer phase .",
    "a crude argument can be proposed to understand this crystallization within the bose - fermi picture of sec .",
    "[ subsec : bosefermi ] : when the mass asymmetry is very large ( very small @xmath210 ) , it is reasonable to say that the mass of the boson will be essentially the one of the heaviest particle , which is the same as the unpaired fermions so that @xmath325 . in terms of commensurability effects , one has @xmath326 so that standard umklapp terms at @xmath327 do not account for the crystallization .",
    "one rather has to look for higher order terms with commensurabilities such as @xmath328 , which are typically associated with terms like @xmath329 in addition to the one of eq .  .",
    "such term can lock the field @xmath330 and make the system fully gapped .",
    "lastly , we would like to stress that such commensurabilities are rather surprising in terms of the initial fermion densities as they belong to _ odd _ filling fractions @xmath331 and @xmath184 .",
    "in summary , the consideration of unusual commensurability conditions in density - density interactions for 1d two - component gases leads to a very rich physics with the possibility of building bound - states of @xmath32-particles as the leading order .",
    "such a mode - locking mechanism can be described within the framework of luttinger liquid theory which reveals the main ingredients to stabilize such a new phase . in particular , mass or velocity asymmetry",
    "is shown to drive efficiently the transition into the multimer phase .",
    "novel fully gapped phases are proposed when taking into account umklapp couplings specific to lattice models at commensurate densities .",
    "these ideas are illustrated and confronted with the asymmetric 1d attractive hubbard model for the special commensurability @xmath332 for which the formation of trimers is found .",
    "the features of the phase diagram are computed , displaying the important role of the density in favoring the trimer phase .",
    "the effective behavior of trimers , which are effectively spinless fermionic objects , is very sensitive to the density and mass asymmetry .",
    "although the model seems to have promising features to sustain a superfluid phase of trimers , we did not find clear evidence for it in the thermodynamical limit , while finite - size systems display a `` superfluid droplets '' physics .",
    "notice that superfluidity of bound - states made of four fermions ( quartets ) can be achieved reliably in 1d with a four - color hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "there , the bound - states are bosons which natural `` free '' regime ( attained in the low - density limit ) is a superfluid phase",
    ". a superfluid phase of trimers would in this respect be even more exotic but is in strong competition with phase separation .",
    "lastly , we found that a trapping confinement supports the trimer phase for reasonably high densities and that surprising crystal phases can emerge at commensurate densities .",
