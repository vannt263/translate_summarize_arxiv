    "it is well - known ( see @xcite ) that if @xmath5  is _ elliptic _ , and @xmath5  and @xmath6  are smooth functions of their arguments , then quasilinear operators in divergence form @xmath7are hypoelliptic : any weak solution @xmath2 of @xmath8 is smooth .",
    "when @xmath9 is _ subelliptic _ - i.e. , when ellipticity fails only to finite order - then hypoellipticity still holds if @xmath9 is _ linear _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath9 is linear but fails to be subelliptic , the situation is more delicate .",
    "for example , fedi showed in @xcite that the two - dimensional operator @xmath10is hypoelliptic if @xmath11 is smooth and positive for all @xmath12 . in this case",
    "@xmath11 is allowed to vanish at any rate at @xmath13 .",

    "two of the authors extended fedi s two - dimensional regularity result for linear equations to certain solutions @xmath2 of ( qfedi ) obtained through the transformation ( [ plt2d ] ) from a solution of the monge - ampre equation ( [ ma2d ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 considered there is assumed to satisfy @xmath23thus @xmath11 is required to become more independent of its second variable as @xmath11 degenerates .",
    "notice that the coefficient @xmath24 in ( [ fedi ] ) is independent of the second variable , and then ( [ thw ] ) is automatically true .",
    "the main result in @xcite establishes that degenerate two - dimensional monge - ampre equations ( [ ma2d ] ) with smooth right - hand side @xmath11 satisfying ( [ thw ] ) are hypoelliptic .",
    "this was the first known hypoellipticity result for infinitely degenerate monge - ampre equations .",
    "more general equations than ( [ qfedi ] ) are also treated in the papers above , including the equation for prescribed gaussian curvature .",
    "in the present work , we improve the two - dimensional results above by lowering the exponent @xmath25 in ( [ thw ] ) to the optimal exponent @xmath26 ; this optimallity is shown in section 3 below .",
    "we also extend the theory of regularity for degenerate quasilinear equations of the type treated in @xcite and @xcite to any dimension @xmath27 and to more general quasilinear problems . in this process",
    "we have to deal with several fundamental difficulties associated with higher dimensions and the more general structure of the equations .",
    "we consider quasilinear equations of the divergence form @xmath28where @xmath29 is an open bounded connected subset of @xmath30 and the matrix @xmath31 , vector function @xmath32 and scalar function @xmath33 are smooth functions of their arguments . here",

    "note that in the case @xmath42 , equation ( [ qfedi ] ) is included among equations of the form @xmath43 by choosing @xmath32@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be the diagonal matrix @xmath47 with @xmath11 independent of @xmath48",
    ". however , equation ( [ equation ] ) does not include systems obtained from the monge - ampre equation by the partial legendre transform introduced in @xcite for higher dimensions , and the treatment of such systems when ellipticity fails to infinite order remains a challenging open problem in dimensions bigger than two .    in section [ hypo ] , under structural restrictions on @xmath31 and @xmath32  which are similar to ( [ thw ] )",
    "( although weaker , see conditions [ hyp1 ] and [ hyp2 ] ) , we first obtain local a priori bounds for the lipschitz norm of smooth solutions in terms of their @xmath49 norm and the parameters inherent to the equation .",
    "this result together with the main theorem in @xcite ( see theorem [ quasi ] below ) provides a priori control of _ all _ derivatives of a smooth solution in terms of the supremum norm of the solution .    in section [ section - proof ]",
    ", we apply the a priori estimates together with an approximation scheme to prove that continuous weak solutions are smooth , and to establish existence , uniqueness , and regularity of solutions of the dirichlet problem . to do so",
    ", we use a class of custom - built barrier functions , a maximum principle and a comparison principle adapted to our class of equations ( see sections [ barriersect ] , [ maxpsection ] and [ compsect ] in the appendix ) .    the method used to construct the barriers in lemma [ barrier ] takes into account only the modulus of continuity of solutions on the boundary .",
    "this generalizes most known barrier constructions , which usually require higher regularity of solutions on the boundary .",
    "as already mentioned , one of our main results , theorem [ application ] below , states that under certain hypotheses on the coefficients @xmath31 , every _ continuous _ weak solution @xmath2 of ( [ equation ] ) is infinitely differentiable , and all of its derivatives are locally controlled by @xmath50 .",
    "the conditions imposed on the coefficients allow them to vanish to infinite order , so the quasilinear operator @xmath9 in ( [ equation ] ) is not in general uniformly elliptic or even subelliptic .",
    "this is the first known hypoellipticity result for infinitely degenerate quasilinear equations in @xmath51 dimensions .",
