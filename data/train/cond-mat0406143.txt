    "in establishing the detailed phase diagram we must thus take into account the competition of pairings with other symmetries , including @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",

    "it seems unlikely as we notice that @xmath54 and @xmath63 being the arguments of @xmath81 cited before in the text , decrease for growing @xmath81 while the bcs - bose boundary ( calculated form the leggett s criterion ,  @xcite i.e. , that chemical potential crosses the bottom of the band ) moves toward larger values of @xmath54 and @xmath63 with increasing electron density , so that the two boundaries do not coincide .",
