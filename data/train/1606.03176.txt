    "semiconductor oxides in spinel structure have drawn considerable attention over many decades as apart from their potentials as technologically important materials @xcite they serve as a class of materials to understand fundamental physics of magnetic interactions , electron - electron correlations and coupling of various degrees of freedom .",
    "magnetic spinels with different magnetic cations at crystallographic inequivalent sites are interesting due to the challenges they pose in understanding the complexities that arise out of different magnetic interactions .",
    "the technological importances of magnetic spinels have been reaffirmed by the recent discovery of multiferrocity in cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite.various collinear and non - collinear structures populate the phase diagram @xcite of this material as a direct consequence of interplay of magnetic exchanges , electron - electron correlation and structural distortions . in order to explore possible multi - functionalities in this multiferroic , very recently",
    ", attempts were made to study material properties by adding a third magnetic atom .",
    "the substitution of cr by fe resulted in new phenomena like magnetic compensation , sign reversal of exchange bias ( eb ) effect @xcite at a critical temperature and significant magnetostriction@xcite .",
    "recent structural and magnetic studies @xcite upon substitution of cr by mn in cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 too showed a composition and temperature induced magnetisation compensation , along with a composition dependent structural transformation .",
    "these results imply that the substitution of cr by another magnetic atom renormalises the intra and inter - sublattice magnetic interactions and can be directly connected to the novel magnetism related phenomena .",
    "however , in order to understand the basic physics of such complex phenomena and interpret the experimental observations , one need to have a clearer understanding at the microscopic level .",
    "such understanding can be achieved if the end compounds that is cocr@xmath1o@xmath2,comn@xmath1o@xmath2 and cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 are investigated in a systematic manner and various physical properties of these materials are understood at a microscopic level , that is , from their electronic structures .",
    "the standardised parameter - free approach to calculate the electronic structures and the physical properties is the various implementations of the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite.there is no systematic exploration of the compounds under consideration here using dft based electronic structure methods . there have been very few dft based calculations of cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and of cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 @xciteonly .",
    "these calculations provided important insights into the interrelations of sub - lattice occupancies , structural properties and magnetic properties of these materials on the basis of their electronic structures .    in this communication",
    ", we present a systematic study of the three compounds co@xmath3o@xmath2 ( b = cr , mn , fe ) with the focus on understanding the similarities and differences in their electronic structures , and thus the structural and magnetic properties in particular",
    ". we do these using dft based calculations .",
    "detailed information on the structural parameters , their influences on the electronic structures , the variations in the crystal fields and exchange fields and their effects on the magnetic properties as one changes the b element are provided .",
    "these results serve as important prerequisites to analyse the systems when they are doped with a third magnetic atom .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section ii details the computational tools used , section iii provides and analyses the results followed by the conclusions .",
    "the crystal structure of spinel compounds @xmath4.the @xmath5,@xmath6 and oxygen atoms are shaded in green , purple and red respectively.,width=188 ]",
    "we have used dft+u @xcite method for all our calculations in order to address the electron electron strong correlation effects which is necessary for oxide systems . among various different adoptions of dft+u",
    ", we have used the approach of dudarev _ et al _ @xcite where the effects of on - site coulomb correlation and hund s coupling are represented through an effective parameter @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the strength of the coulomb interaction and @xmath9 the hund s coupling . in our calculations , @xmath9 has been kept at 1 ev as previous dft calculations for a number of transition metal oxides showed that @xmath9 remains nearly constant for the entire transition metal series @xcite .",
    "the coulomb parameter @xmath8 has been taken to be 3 ev for cr , 4 ev for mn and fe , 5 ev for co. the rationale behind such choices have been explained earlier@xcite .",
    "the self - consistent quantum mechanical equations are solved using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite basis set as implemented in vasp code @xcite .",
    "the exchange correlation part of the hamiltonian was treated with the pbe - gga @xcite functional .",
    "a plane wave cut off of 550 ev and a @xmath10 mesh centerd at @xmath11 point for brillouin zone integrations have been used throughout to ensure an energy convergence of @xmath12 ev . for structural relaxations",
    "the convergence criteria of force on each atom was set to be @xmath13 ev/@xmath14 .",
    "the spinel structure belongs to cubic space group @xmath15 with two types of cation sublattice-@xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath5 sublattice has tetrahedral symmetry and is usually occupied by a cation in + 2 state .",
    "the @xmath6 sublattice has octahedral symmetry and is usually occupied by a cation in + 3 state ( figure 1 ) .",
    "one formula unit of spinel consists of one @xmath5 sublattice and two @xmath6 sublattices . in case of one @xmath6 atom occupying the tetrahedral positions by displacing the @xmath5 atom to the octahedral sites ,",
    "the structure is known as inverse spinel. among the three compounds under consideration , the cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 is found to be crystallising in normal spinel structures @xcite . in case of comn@xmath1o@xmath2 , although the sub - lattice occupancy conforms to that of spinel , the crystal structure is tetragonal with space group @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "cofe@xmath1o@xmath2,on the other hand , has no structural distortion , but has the sub - lattice occupancy alike inverse spinel @xcite.the sub - lattice occupancies in cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 is found out to be crucial in determining whether the ground state is insulator or half - metal @xcite . regarding the ground state magnetic structure , neutron diffraction studies have shown that cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 and comn@xmath1o@xmath2 have canted spin structures @xcitewhile cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 has a ferrimagnetic collinear structure , with the moments at @xmath5 and @xmath6 sites anti - aligning , giving rise to the neel configuration @xcite.mossbauer studies @xcite later confirmed this .    the sub - lattice occupancy for cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 and comn@xmath1o@xmath2 have been taken to be like normal spinels as have been found from experiments . for cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "inverse spinel sub - lattice occupancy with maximum inversion has been considered . in absence of disorder at a particular sub - lattice , this configuration is found to be having the lowest energy@xcite . since modeling of the sub - lattice disorder requires either construction of a supercell in the present approach or consideration of a mean field configuration averaging procedure @xcite , we have considered the complete inverse spinel type sub - lattice occupancy .",
    "since the motivation behind this work is a systematic understanding of the three systems as the chemical identity of the @xmath6 atom changes , we have taken the magnetic configurations of the three systems to be collinear .",
    "although cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 and comn@xmath1o@xmath2 have non - collinear magnetic ground states , the investigations into the collinear magnetic states would provide important qualitative insights . in order to find out the relative alignments of the spins at various sub - lattices",
    ", we have taken 2 formula units of the unit cell and done total energy calculations on different collinear spin configurations .",
    "we found the neel configuration to be energetically lowest in case of cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 and cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 . in case of comn@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", we found a magnetic configuration in which the spins at the sites of a given sub - lattice are anti - parallel , giving rise to a zero magnetic moment at each sub - lattice , lowest in energy .",
    "however , the energy of the neel configuration is higher by about only 1 mev per atom .",
    "this result indicates that the actual magnetic ground state of comn@xmath1o@xmath2 would be frustrated . in subsequent analysis",
    "we have considered only the neel configuration therefore .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained after full structural relaxations using dft+u for the three compounds are given in table [ struc - tab ] .",
    "figure 2 provides the details of various bond lengths and bond angles , thus providing a close - up view of the structures around the tetrahedral and the octahedral sites .",
    "the lattice parameters agree well with the available experimental results .",
    "cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 stabilises in the cubic structure with almost no local distortion at the tetrahedral site as can be seen from the ideal spinel value of @xmath17 for the @xmath18 angle .",
    "there is slight local distortion at the octahedral site ; the @xmath19 bond angle is @xmath20 , deviating from the ideal value of @xmath21 and the @xmath22 bond angle is @xmath23 in place of ideal value of @xmath24 .",
    "comn@xmath1o@xmath2 , on the other hand , has a tetragonal crystal structure with @xmath25 .",
    "subsequently various bond distances and bond angles ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) are significantly dispersed .",
    "one can now see substantial distortion associated with the tetrahedral sites as the @xmath18 bond angles are @xmath26 .",
    "the octahedra too distorts considerably with elongation(contraction ) of @xmath27 bonds along @xmath28 directions[fig .",
    "this leads to significant variations in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 angles .",
    "the differences in the distortions in the octahedra around the b sites in comn@xmath1o@xmath2 in comparison to cocr@xmath31o@xmath2 is pictorially represented in fig .",
    "3 . in case of cofe@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", our calculations produce a slight departure from the perfect cubic structure , the @xmath32axis elongated by about @xmath33 .",
    "this slight loss of cubic symmetry is due to different distortions of the octahedra around co and fe sites .",
    "3(c ) shows that while there is slight elongations of @xmath34 bonds along @xmath35-direction , the @xmath36 bonds in the same direction contracts in comparison to the same bonds in the @xmath37 planes .",
    "this gives rise to the small tetragonality .",
    "the bond angles ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) associated with the octahedral and tetrahedral sites clearly show that the distortions associated with co atoms in the octahedral sites .",
    "the @xmath18 bond angle deviates to @xmath38 as opposed to @xmath39 bond angle of @xmath40 which is quite close to ideal spinel value of @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 bond angle is @xmath42 , while that of @xmath43 bond angle is @xmath23 , a larger deviation from ideal spinel value of @xmath24 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath44 : reference @xcite @xmath45 : reference @xcite @xmath46 : reference @xcite    the magnetic exchange interactions are computed by mapping the gga+u total energies of different collinear spin configurations on to a heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the results for the nearest neighbour interactions are presented in table [ table3].the higher neighbour exchange interactions are smaller by an order of magnitude and hence they are not considered for discussions .",
    "the results show that the a - a interactions are the weakest and therefore , is not expected to play any significant role .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion by kaplan @xcite . in cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 , the a - b and b - b exchange interactions are comparable . in this case",
    "b site @xmath47 orbitals are half - filled .",
    "so direct b - b interactions is possible , apart from the super - exchange via oxygen atoms .",
    "moreover , nearly empty @xmath48 orbitals reduces the anion shielding as partial covalency via @xmath48 orbitals are possible . however , since the a site @xmath47 orbitals are half - filled and the b site @xmath48 orbitals are nearly empty as seen from the densities of states , the a - b interactions ceases to be the strongest .",
    "therefore , the a - b and b - b interactions are comparable for cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 . due to these two interactions being comparable",
    ", the spin structure of cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 is not collinear @xcite as has been observed in the experiments .",
    "the calculation of the so called lkdm parameter @xcite which characterises the magnetic structure of cubic spinels also confirmed this picture @xcite . in comn@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the a - site @xmath47 orbitals are half - filled while the b - site @xmath48 orbitals are less than half - filled and degenerate .",
    "this should lead to a strong antiferromagnetic a - b interaction which indeed is observed in our calculations ( @xmath49 mev ) . as for the b - b interaction , the b - site @xmath47 orbitals are half - filled and so direct b - b interactions , apart from super - exchange via oxygen is possible .",
    "however , the strength of this interaction would depend on the inter - cation distance @xcite . due to the tetragonal distortion , the in - plane mn - mn distances are short ( @xmath50 ) and",
    "thus the direct interactions are extremely strong@xmath51 mev ( table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the out - of - plane mn - mn distances are , on the other hand are @xmath52 .",
    "this weakens the b - b interactions and are only @xmath53 mev .",
    "this huge anisotropy in the exchange interactions due to the tetragonal distortion leads to a complicated non - collinear spin structure @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy in the comn@xmath1o@xmath2 was discussed earlier @xcite but was never calculated from first - principles .",
    "our calculations provided the quantitative credence to the original idea .    in case of cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the overwhelmingly dominant interactions are the a - b interactions as is seen from our calculations .",
    "this explains the reason behind a collinear spin structure of this system .",
    "the reason behind this strong antiferromagnetic a - b interaction is that the a site @xmath47 orbitals and b site @xmath48 orbitals ( for both fe and co at b site ) are half - filled .",
    "the reason behind a weak co - co and co - fe interactions at the b site is that the co @xmath47 orbitals are more than half - filled and degenerate and hence no direct b - b interactions occurs between them .",
    "fe@xmath54-fe@xmath54 interactions are stronger than these two as the @xmath47 orbitals of fe@xmath54 are half - filled and hence direct interactions are possible . however , since the fe@xmath54 @xmath48 orbitals are also half - filled , partial covalency with anions is also not possible(as seen in the extremely localised fe densities of states ) , leading to a large anion shielding and a subsequent reduction in the b - b interaction in comparison to the a - b interaction .",
    "the ferrimagnetic transition temperatures ( @xmath55 ) are calculated using these exchange interactions and under mean field approximation , as done in ref .",
    "our calculated results and a comparison with experimental values are presented in table [ table3 ] .",
    "as expected , the critical temperatures calculated by a mean field approximation overestimates the values .",
    "however , the calculated values reproduce the trends seen in the experiments with cofe@xmath1o@xmath2 having a large @xmath55 due to very large values of @xmath56 while the other two have rather small values of @xmath55 due to competing @xmath56 and @xmath57 leading to non - collinear magnetic structures .",
    "we have performed a systematic investigations into the structural and magnetic properties of cob@xmath1o@xmath2 magnetic spinels by changing the b cation using first - principles density functional theory based methods .",
    "the understanding of the properties of these compounds is done by quantifying the relative strengths of the crystal field effect and the exchange effect through an analysis of their electronic structures .",
    "we find that the electron - electron interactions of the magnetic cations play a very important role and without the incorporation of this , the correct ground state structures can not be obtained .",
    "the strong electron correlations are responsible for significant local structural distortions at the octahedral site and global tetragonal distortions for comn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "these are responsible for the trends in the electronic properties such as the band gap .",
    "the electronic structures of these compounds are significantly different as the b site cation is changed .",
    "this , in turn , affects the inter - atomic magnetic exchange interactions considerably and is responsible for very different spin structures of these systems . in this work , for the first time",
    ", understanding of the trends in the magnetic properties are attempted through proper quantification of the associated quantities and by providing necessary explanations from the trends in the local structural parameters and the electronic structures .",
    "the results hold immense significance with regard to the recent experimental results on co(cr@xmath58fe@xmath59)@xmath1o@xmath2 and co(cr@xmath58mn@xmath59)@xmath1o@xmath2 systems , where the chemical properties of the third magnetic atom in cocr@xmath1o@xmath2 , the sub - lattice occupancies and the structural distortions are thought to be giving rise to interesting functional properties . in future communications ,",
