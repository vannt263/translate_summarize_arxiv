    "heavy - ion collisions can be used as a powerful tool for tests of quantum electrodynamics at the supercritical coulomb fields @xcite . to date",
    "many approaches were employed to treat such collisions  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite a method of solving the time - dependent dirac equation in the basis of atomic - like dirac - fock - sturm orbitals was developed .    in the present paper",
    "we develop an alternative approach to treatment of low - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the method is based on using the cubic hermite spline basis set on a two - dimensional uniform grid .",
    "the dirac equation is considered in a rotating reference frame .",
    "previously the time - dependent schrdinger equation was treated in a rotating coordinate frame in ref .",
    "the basis of cubic hermite splines was used for non - relativistic time - dependent calculations  @xcite and for relativistic time - dependent calculations in the monopole approximation  @xcite . to our best knowledge ,",
    "however , the hermite splines have not been employed before for solving the time - dependent dirac equation for the real two - center problem .",
    "the theoretical methods are described in section  [ sec : theory ] .",

    "atomic units ( @xmath4 ) are used throughout the paper .",

    "this basis can be defined in the following way .",

    "two functions are introduced : @xmath11 where @xmath12    @xmath13    since only adjacent splines overlap , the hamiltonian and overlapping matrices are sparse .",
    "it is the significant advantage of this basis .",
    "the two - dimensional basis hermite splines are defined as @xmath14 here @xmath15 enumerates the splines @xmath16 in the certain way .",
    "we consider a collision of @xmath0 ( target ) and @xmath17 ( projectile ) .",
    "the position of the target is fixed , the projectile moves along a straight line with a constant velocity .",
    "the electron movement is considered in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath18 which is rotating around the target with the internuclear axis as @xmath19-axis . in this coordinate system",
    "the dirac equation is written as  @xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dirac wave function , @xmath23 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath24 is the angular velocity of the reference frame , and    @xmath25    here @xmath26 are the dirac matrices , and @xmath27 is the two - center potential . in eq .",

    "in the present work the charge transfer probabilities in the @xmath0@xmath3 collisions were calculated for a wide range of the impact parameter . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ gr : capture ] , the results of the calculations with six channels are in a good agreement with the corresponding values obtained in ref .",
    "since @xmath53 , the rotation of the internuclear axis is not taken into account in the case of the one channel calculations . as one can observe from fig.1 ,",
