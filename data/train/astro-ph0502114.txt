    "thus , ulxs are likely to be a heterogeneous group of high - mass x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and supernovae , products of recent star formation and found primarily in late - type galaxies , and low - mass xrbs ( lmxbs ) in the late evolutionary stages of the mass donor star , accounting for ulxs in ellipticals ( see also king 2002 ) .",

    "source #  6 appears to be extremely hard and occupies a region in the color - color diagram where the spectrum is very flat ( compare figure  4 of prestwich et al .",
    "this source is also a strong radio source .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  5018 , in contrast , is very soft .",
    "this is mainly due to the presence of a strong thermal component , as discussed in   4 .",
    "the absolute v band magnitude ( m@xmath2 ) is shown against the ( v  i ) color for the six possible optical counterparts to the non - nuclear sources in figure  4 .",
    "four of the counterparts are much brighter than individual stars .",
    "all four of these counterparts are as bright or brighter than globular clusters ( gcs ) in the milky way ( harris 1996 ) indicating they are massive compact gcs analogous to some of those found in other nearby galaxies .",
    "in contrast , only upper limits were obtained for any counterparts to sources #  1 and #  4 .    also shown in figure  4",
    "are the regions of color - magnitude space occupied by super star clusters ( sscs ) in some well - studied star - forming galaxies .",
    "sscs are compact , luminous star clusters that have sizes and luminosities comparable to gcs but are relatively much younger ( 1  gyr ) and bluer than gcs .",
    "they tend to lie blueward of ( v  i)@xmath30.8 , as indicated in figure  4 , though there is substantial overlap among the two classes .",
    "the ngc  5018 gc survey undertaken by hilker & kissler - patig ( 1996 ) discovered at least two populations of gc : a blue population with @xmath40v ",
    "i@xmath41@xmath30.7 ( about 10% of all gcs ) and a broader red population with ( v  i)1.0 .",
    "hilker & kissler - patig ( 1996 ) attribute the blue population to those gcs formed within the last few 100  myr to 6  gyr while the red population is an older primordial population .",
    "it should be noted that the ( v  i ) colors alone can not discriminate between age and metallicity effects .",
    "the blue clusters may simply be old metal - poor clusters ( perhaps captured from another galaxy in a merger or interaction ) .",
    "four bright optical counterparts to x - ray sources have ( v  i ) colors overlapping with this population of blue gcs in ngc  5018 .",
    "they are also within the ( v  i ) color range of agns ( @xmath30  to @xmath32 ; e.g. , zaggia et al .",
    "in fact , the optical counterpart to source #  3 (   3.5 ) varied by @xmath31 mag at optical wavelengths suggesting it is a background source and not a gc .",
    "source #  1 is the brightest x - ray object among the six ulx candidates detected in ngc  5018 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this source is best described as an absorbed power law .",
    "its intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) luminosity in the 0.58.0 kev band is ( 1.29@xmath420.17)@xmath810@xmath43  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "it is not a highly absorbed source , because the value of n@xmath24 is consistent with the galactic n@xmath24 .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of source #  1 is shown in figure  5 .",
    "the source is variable at a 94% confidence level during the _ chandra _  observation according to the @xmath44 test against a constant flux hypothesis ( @xmath45=1.3 for 62 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , the kolomogorov - smirnov test , which is sensitive to longer term variabiltiy , gave a probability 0.85 indicating the source was almost constant .",
    "thus , any short term variability was averaged out over the duration of the observation .",
    "there is a weak source within the x - ray error circle of source #  1 in both the v and i _ hubble _",
    "images ( figure  6 ) .",
    "however , several other nearby pixels show similar brightness levels and the object within the error circle may simply be caused by statistical fluctuations in the ngc  5018 field .",
    "it should therefore be considered as an upper limit to any optical counterpart to source #  1 .",
    "note that the measured absolute magnitude , @xmath46=-6.5@xmath421.2 , still exceeds that for all individual stars except for the brightest early - type supergiants .",
    "we note that the faintest globular clusters seen in our galaxy have a similar brightness ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "only 18 photons were detected from the _ chandra _  image of source #  2 corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity of ( 1.0@xmath420.4 )  x  10@xmath9  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "its x - ray colors are unremarkable ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "a potential optical counterpart is present in the _ hubble _  v and i images within 0.10 of the _ chandra _  position .",
    "figure  7 shows a portion of the i band _ hubble _  image with the 0.15 _ chandra _  error circle superposed .",
    "the source is close to the bright nucleus and this accounts for the large gradient visible in the field surrounding the source .",
    "this source was observed on two occasions with the hst / pc1 camera and no variability was detected .",
    "the m@xmath2 and ( v  i ) values obtained for the counterpart ( figure  4 and table  3 ) are consistent with those of galactic globular clusters .",
    "thus , source #  2 could be a ulx within a globular cluster in ngc  5018 .",
    "source #  3 is bright enough in x - ray light to constrain its spectral shape .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is that of a modestly - absorbed power law ( table  1 ) with no other distinguishing spectral characteristics or unusual x - ray colors ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the optical object at the location of source #  3 is the only counterpart detected in all three _ hubble _  filters .",
    "figure  8 shows the v band _",
    "image and figure  9 the u band image .",
    "the region of ngc  5018 containing source #  3 was observed twice in v and i bands and once in u ( table  2 ) .",
    "table  3 shows that the counterpart to source  #  3 varied in both v and i by about 1  mag between observations .",
    "since the u band observations were not contemporaneous with either of the the v and i observations , we can not make meaningful estimates of the ( u  v ) or ( u  i ) colors of the counterpart to source #  3 .",
    "the ( v  i ) color indicates the object is on the blue side of typical globular clusters and bordering on the ssc region ( figure  4 ) .",
    "however , the variability is inconsistent with gc ( or ssc ) behavior .",
    "the @xmath47  ratio is of order unity ( table  3 ) whereas foreground stars have lower values ( maccacaro et al .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that source #  3 is most likely a background agn .",
    "source #  4 is another weak x - ray emitter with non - distinct x - ray colors .",
    "no obvious optical counterpart can be discerned from either the available _ hubble _  v ( figure  10 ) or i band images of the field and only upper limits to a potential counterpart are listed in table  3 . in this regard ,",
    "it is similar to source  #  1 though source #  1 is much brighter in x - rays than source #  4 .",
    "source #  5 is moderately weak in x - rays with 42 counts detected .",
    "this corresponds to an intrinsic x - ray luminosity of ( 2.4@xmath420.3)@xmath48  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "a potential counterpart was detected in both v and i images . after applying astrometric corrections ,",
    "the positional difference between the counterpart and the ulx candidate is 0.20 .",
    "figure  11 shows the v band _",
    "image in the vicinity of ulx candidate #  5 .",
    "the location of the counterpart of ulx #  5 in figure 4 suggests that it may be either a gc or a ssc in ngc  5018 or a background agn .",
    "source #  6 is a weak x - ray source but is distinguished by an extremely hard x - ray spectrum as evidenced by its position in the x - ray color - color diagram ( figure  3 ) .",
    "although the x - ray colors suggest a very flat spectrum , the low s / n data does not allow us to rule out a more - typical power law index of @xmath49@xmath31.8 .",
    "the region around this source was imaged only in the v and i filters .",
    "after astrometric corrections were applied to these images , a bright source was detected within 0.2 from the _ chandra _  location ( figure  12 ) .",
    "the optical source is similar to the other bright ulx counterparts in that it has a color and magnitude consistent with a globular cluster in ngc  5018 .    unlike all other ulx candidates in the ngc  5018 field , high - resolution radio data confirms ( mollenhoff et al .",
    "1992 ) the detection of a radio source ( kim et al .",
    "1988 ) at the position of source #  6 ( see table  5 ) . after applying astrometric corrections based on the x - ray and radio positions of the nucleus ,",
    "the position of the radio source is within 0.15 of the _ chandra _  position of source  #  6 .",
    "this was confirmed through our multi - wavelength radio observations obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "we obtained radio continuum data in total and polarized intensity on june 30 , 2004 , simultaneously observing at four frequencies , 1.4 , 2.3 , 4.8 , and 8.6 ghz with the atca in the 1.5b array .",
    "measured flux densities are given in table  5 .",
    "the radio spectrum is inverted with a spectral index of @xmath3  0.2 .",
    "the source shows no polarization above 3 sigma at any of the four frequencies .",
    "one model for ulxs invokes relativistic beaming to account for the high apparent x - ray luminosity ( georganopoulos et al .",
    "the radio flux should also be high in this scenario .",
    "however , the x - ray spectra of galactic and extragalactic jet sources are typically much steeper than that of source #  6 and the observed inverted radio spectrum is not typical of jets which have radio spectral indices near -0.6 ( worrall & birkinshaw 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , an inverted spectrum and a lack of polarization are indicative of compact cores of radio galaxies .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  5018 is surrounded by an @xmath315  radius ( @xmath33 kpc ) region of unresolved emission .",
    "figure 13 displays the radial profile of the x - ray surface brightness about the nucleus . also shown is the radial profile of a nearby point source ( ulx candidate # 3 ) clearly demonstrating the extended nature of the nuclear emission .",
    "if the nuclear emission is from isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , then the surface brightness profile would follow a standard beta model , @xmath50@xmath51 . fitting this function ( plus a constant representing the background ) to the 0.38.0  kev x - ray profile out to 15  from the nucleus results in values of @xmath52 ( @xmath390 pc ) , and @xmath53 ( @xmath54=34.0 for 27 dof ) .",
    "this function is shown as the smooth curve in figure  13 .",
    "the small core radius , @xmath55 , and the low value of @xmath56 means the profile forms a cusp at the center but is rather flat at larger radii .    the cusp may be due to a true point source at the nucleus ; consistent with the identification of a point - like object at that location by our source - finding algorithm .",
    "this source has a soft spectrum as shown by its x - ray colors (   3.1 ) , but a hard spectral component is often also present in active galactic nuclei .",
    "therefore , the radial profile in the 28  kev band was extracted and compared to the full - band profile .",
    "the hard - band profile appears more concentrated toward the nucleus ( best - fit @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; @xmath54 = 32.3 for 27 dof ) compared with the full band profile but is consistent with that profile within errors .",
    "it can not be concluded , based on the surface brightness profiles alone , whether or not there is an x - ray - emitting active nucleus in ngc  5018 .    guided by the known angular size of a point source at the position of the nucleus , we extracted the x - ray spectrum from two regions : one from an annulus extending from 3  to 20  around the nucleus and excluding the point sources within this region ( henceforth , the extended component ) , and the other from a disk of radius 3(the nuclear component ) .",
    "the 20  outer radius was chosen to roughly correspond to the ( spatially - uniform ) background level .",
    "the spectra were binned to obtain at least 20 counts per fitting bin .",
    "a corresponding background spectrum was extracted from a circular annulus that extends from 40  to 70  radii , again excluding point sources .",
    "various xspec models were fitted to the extended component spectrum as presented in table 4 ( labeled `` diffuse '' in column 1 ) .",
    "the spectrum requires at least two spectral components for an acceptable fit .",
    "the best fit is a thermal emission line ( mekal ) plus power law model ( row 6 , table  4 ) .",
    "the abundances of metals is poorly constrained by this model but are consistent with solar values . the spectrum and best - fit model",
    "are shown in figure  14 . extrapolating the luminosity in the 3  to 20  annular spectral extraction region to the center of the galaxy using the beta model shape results in a total 0.58.0  kev absorption - corrected luminosity of @xmath59  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "the shape of the extended x - ray spectrum suggests a hot gas origin for the x - ray emission .",
    "this is supported by observations at other wavelengths .",
    "h@xmath6 emission has been detected extending to 32  ( @xmath3 6.3 kpc ) from the nucleus with a total luminosity @xmath60  ergs  s@xmath1  ( goudfrooij et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this region also has a distinctly bluer color ( @xmath61  mag ) relative to its surroundings ( carollo & danziger 1994 ) . a portion of the radio emission can also be attributed to an extended source .",
    "the total 20  cm continuum emission measured over a 20  region around the nucleus is 3.1@xmath420.17 mjy and that from the nucleus itself ( @xmath621 ) is ( 1.9@xmath420.1 ) mjy ( mollenhoff et al .",
    "thus , about 1.2@xmath420.2 mjy is attributable to the extended emission .",
    "the radio luminosity is then @xmath63  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with our recent radio measurements ( table  5 )",
    ".    some of the extended x - ray emission may also be due to unresolved point sources .",
    "in particular , the hard ( power law ) spectral component may be produced by lmxbs in the relatively dense core of ngc  5018 .",
    "the fraction of the extended x - ray emission attributed to this component is 0.46 for a luminosity of @xmath64  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "if we assume that of order 10@xmath65  ergs  s@xmath1  is an average x - ray luminosity of lmxbs , then @xmath3600 unresolved lmxbs are required to account for the hard x - ray emission from the extended component .",
    "this is not an unrealistic number of lmxbs in a typical elliptical galaxy .",
    "however , a population of lmxbs can not account for the extended emission observed at other wavelengths .",
    "measured radio luminosities of galactic lmxbs ( e.g. , han & hjellming 1992 ; berendsen et al .",
    "2000 ; homan et al .",
    "2004 ) are only of order @xmath310@xmath66  ergs  s@xmath1  and balmer line emission from lmxb accretion disks is of order a few 10@xmath66  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "based on these results , we believe that the extended radio , h@xmath6 , and at least 54% of the x - ray emission are from diffuse hot gas in the central regions of ngc  5018 .    the spectrum of the nuclear component is also best represented by a two component model ( row 8 in table  4 ; figure  15 ) .",
    "of course , we expect a soft component analogous to the soft emission from the surrounding region .",
    "unfortunately , the hard component is also consistent with an extrapolation of the power law emission from beyond the nucleus and so , again , we can not unequivocally confirm an active nucleus for ngc  5018 .",
    "if we assume a nuclear point source is present , then we can compare it to other low luminosity agns ( llagns ) .",
    "within 3 the power law component contributes 51% of the total luminosity or l@xmath31  =  ( 3.5@xmath67  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "we consider this as the maximum luminosity from any central point source . to obtain a minimum luminosity estimate , we performed a joint fit to the nuclear and extended spectra using a mekal plus powerlaw model .",
    "then , with the constraint that the same parameters are used to fit both spectra , a second power law component was added to the model of the nuclear spectrum only .",
    "the 90% confidence upper limit to the contribution from the second powerlaw component is l@xmath31=2@xmath68  ergs  s@xmath1  with a best - fit value of zero .",
    "using these x - ray luminosity limits , the resulting ratio of the 5 ghz flux density ( table  5 ) to the x - ray luminosity , log[@xmath69(5ghz)/l@xmath31 ] , is between -2.4 and -0.15 .",
    "this is within the range of -4.6 to -1.2 typical of llagns ( terashima & wilson 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , the value of log(l@xmath31/l@xmath71 ) for ngc  5018 is between -1.5 and 0.74 assuming all the h@xmath6 emission from the 3   nuclear region is associated with the point source at the nucleus .",
    "terashima & wilson ( 2003 ) find log(l@xmath31/l@xmath71 ) for llagns are in the range -0.6 to 2.0 .",
    "there is no evidence for variability of the nuclear emission during the 30  ks _ chandra _  observation .",
    "the light curve of the hard x - ray emission , @xmath112  kev , is of insufficient quality to determine if the power - law emission component alone is variable .",
    "six non - nuclear x - ray point sources were detected in ngc  5018 in a 30  ks _ chandra _  observation .",
    "all six sources are potentially ulxs and each displays interesting x - ray and optical properties .",
    "an estimated 1.4 sources are background objects .",
    "the dominant contribution to the x - ray point source population in early - type galaxies is lmxbs .",
    "individually , accretion disks and companion stars of lmxbs are too faint at non - x - ray wavelengths to be detectable at the distance of ngc  5018 even with _ hubble_. sources #  1 and #  4 are in this category .",
    "only upper limits to potential optical counterparts to these sources could be determined and this limit , @xmath46 - 6.5 , excludes only the brightest early - type supergiant companions .",
    "a better constraint on the companion mass can be made if mass transfer is assumed to be driven by the nuclear evolution of the companion . in this case , the observed x - ray luminosities can be used to constrain the mass transfer rate and hence the companion mass . if the companion is a main sequence star , then it must be more massive than 8 and 20 m@xmath12  for source #  4 and #  1 , respectively ( assuming a 10% efficiency converting accreting matter to x - radiation ) .",
    "if the companion is in its giant phase , then these values are reduced to 4 and 8 m@xmath12 .",
    "( note that these two sources span the range of x - ray luminosities of all the non - nuclear sources so the stellar companions to these other sources also have masses in the range 4 to 20 m@xmath12  by these arguments . )",
    "stars of such high mass are too short - lived to have been formed at the time of interaction between ngc  5018 and other group member galaxies . perhaps , as discussed by king ( 2002 ) , these objects are soft x - ray transients in outburst with emission beamed in the direction of the observer . alternatively ,",
    "bildsten & deloye ( 2004 ) propose ultracompact binaries that can produce very high mass accretion rates from gravitational radiation losses and hence x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath35@xmath8@xmath72  ergs  s@xmath1 .    in any case",
    ", the remarkably high x - ray luminosity of source #  1 , @xmath11@xmath4  ergs  s@xmath1  based on spectral fitting , is perplexing .",
    "no model of lmxbs can easily account for such a high x - ray luminosity .",
    "statistically , background objects are most likely to be among the brightest x - ray objects in elliptical galaxy fields ( irwin , bregman , & athey 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , background agns tend to have x - ray to optical flux ratios of order unity ( e.g. , maccacaro et al .",
    "1988 ; green et al .",
    "2004 ) predicting an optical counterpart to source #  1 far above the _ hubble _  detection limit , though none was found for source #  1 ( ratio @xmath73186 ; table  3 ) .",
    "the remaining four sources are all associated with optically bright objects .",
    "the ( v  i ) colors and v magnitudes of these objects are consistent with gcs in ngc  5018 ( hilker & kissler - patig 1996 ) .",
    "however , source #  3 is likely a background agn based on its optical variability and source #  6 is likely a background radio galaxy based on its radio signature . without a spectroscopic redshift confirmation",
    ", we can not be certain if any of these four sources are truly ulxs in ngc  5018 gcs or background objects .",
    "statistically , we expect 1.4 background objects among our 6 ulx candidates , and we expect the x - ray luminosities of the true ulxs to be below @xmath32@xmath8@xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1  ( irwin , athey , & bregman 2003 ; irwin , bregman , & athey 2004 ) . statistically , therefore , sources #  3 and  6 can account for the expected background contribution . in the broader context , we caution that x - ray bright background objects also tend to be optically bright .",
    "in addition to point sources and a possible weak llagn , diffuse hot gas has also been detected in the xradiation from ngc  5018 .",
    "this gas may be the remnant of interactions of ngc  5018 with its neighbor galaxies .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the hot plasma , estimated from the x - ray spectral fit parameters and the size of the emission region , is a few times 10@xmath74 to 10@xmath75  yr , depending on the gas filling factor .",
    "this is shorter than the estimated 300 to 600  myr since the last interaction ( guhathakurta et al .",
    "this suggests the gas is still falling in and/or it is being reheated by ionization , stellar winds , and supernovae from current or recent star formation activity .",
    "the current star formation rate ( sfr ) implied by the h@xmath6 luminosity is only @xmath30.1  m@xmath12  yr@xmath1 but some of this gas is obscured by overlying dust ( goudfrooij et al .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity of ngc  5018 is 2@xmath810@xmath76  ergs  s@xmath1  ( thronson & bally 1987 ) corresponding to a star formation rate of @xmath30.9 m@xmath12  yr@xmath1 .",
    "this , in turn , may be an overestimate as there is a substantial contribution to the fir luminosity from dust heated by the interstellar radiation field ( guhathakurta et al .",
    "1989 ) in addition to the warm component normally associated with young star - forming regions .",
    "the mass of atomic and molecular gas in ngc  5018 is @xmath77@xmath31.4@xmath8@xmath78  m@xmath12 ( georgakakis , forbes , & norris 2000 ) implying a gas consumption timescale ( @xmath77/sfr ) of order a hubble time .",
    "thus , while there is little current star formation activity , there is a significant reservoir of gas to maintain this low , steady , level of star formation since the last interaction that may explain the diffuse thermal x - ray ( and h@xmath6 and radio ) emission from the central regions of ngc  5018 .",
    "we may obtain a broad , though speculative , interpretation of the recent history of ngc  5018 from its x - ray to radio properties .",
    "the morphology and radial velocity structure of the hi gas indicate the interaction between ngc  5018 and ngc  5022 was not a direct impact and merger but an encounter that left the more massive ngc  5018 essentially intact .",
    "the interaction did strip gas from ngc  5022 that presently traces the path of the interaction in hi ( kim et al .",
    "1988 ; guhathakurta et al .",
    "1989 ) , produced the optical shells ( malin & hadley 1997 ) , and is currently accreting toward the center of ngc  5018 where it is being heated and ionized .",
    "stars are currently forming out of this gas at a low rate but the rate may have been higher in the recent past if the ulx sources are binaries accreting from normal or giant stars . within the stellar system",
    "is the usual population of lmxbs .",
    "most lie below the point source detection limit in the current _ chandra _  data but a number of exceptionally luminous ( ulx ) candidates are present .",
    "these appear to trace the relatively young population of stars contained in blue gcs that may have formed since the last interaction .",
