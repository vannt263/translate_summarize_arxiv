    "driven by the heavy - ion programs at gsi , cern sps , rhic and soon the lhc there is strong interest in the properties of strongly interacting matter at extreme temperatures and baryon densities .",
    "ultimately these have to be understood on the basis of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which governs the strong interaction sector of the standard model .",
    "qcd at zero temperature and density is well - established by now both numerically and analytically .",
    "besides numerical evaluations on discrete space - time lattices , e.g.  @xcite , functional methods based on the functional renormalization group ( frg ) , e.g.  @xcite , and dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) , e.g.  @xcite , have been used to elucidate our understanding of the theory of strong interactions .",
    "if applicable , lattice computations give high numerical accuracy with small truncation errors .",
    "functional methods have their advantages if it comes to the deep infrared , the simple explanation of physical mechanisms as well as the inclusion of chiral dynamical quarks .",
    "the last years have seen a very fruitful interaction between the different methods leading to a largely quantitative understanding of qcd at vanishing temperature and density even though the full understanding of the confinement mechanism and its relation to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is not yet settled .    at finite temperature and",
    "in particular at finite baryon density or chemical potential @xmath1 the situation is much less clear . at finite @xmath1 lattice computations",
    "have principal limitations due to the complex action which hampers stringent theoretical evaluations of the qcd phase diagram , in particular the possible critical endpoint of the line of first - order transitions from first principles .",
    "functional methods have been used to obtain results for pure yang - mills at finite temperature , as well as the hadronic sector of qcd at finite temperature and density , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a full qcd study is hampered by the fact that the gauge sector , i.e.  the confinement - deconfinement phase transition in pure yang - mills , is not fully resolved yet : the potential for the order parameter , the polyakov loop , does not lead to a phase transition in perturbative computations , e.g.  @xcite , but recently this gap has been closed within a non - perturbative flow study @xcite .",
    "hence , a first principle approach to qcd at finite temperature and density with functional methods is in reach . in our opinion",
    "this opens a way to continuing the fruitful interaction between the different methods that has already proven so successful at vanishing temperature .",
    "a first step towards a full qcd study with functional methods is done by studying effective lagrangian models which are constructed from the non - perturbative yang - mills effective potential and effective hadronic models . in recent years",
    "a promising realization of this idea has been put forward , based on lattice results for the thermodynamic potential in pure yang - mills ( ym ) theory and universality arguments  @xcite .",
    "pure ym theory corresponds to the heavy - quark limit of qcd in which the polyakov loop expectation value serves as an order parameter for confinement .",
    "this approach results in an effective scalar @xmath2-theory whose physical minima are the vacuum expectation values of the polyakov loop .",
    "it has been observed that a thermodynamic potential for the polyakov loop can be constructed where the parameters are fitted to precise finite - temperature lattice data for the equation of state ( eos ) in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "this very successful theory simulates the calculated first - order confinement - deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "for two light flavors , on the other hand , qcd exhibits an ( almost ) exact chiral symmetry and is believed to be in same universality class as the @xmath3 model  @xcite .",
    "an effective realization of this symmetry is provided by the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model or , upon bosonization , the quark - meson ( qm ) model .",
    "it is therefore natural to combine both aspects of qcd by coupling light chiral quarks to the polyakov loop field .",
    "this results in the pnjl model  @xcite or the pqm model , which has the benefit of renormalizability , and a simpler linkage to full qcd , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "calculations for the thermodynamic potential and the resulting phase structure will be performed at the mean - field level as was done in similar analyses using the pnjl model .",
    "eventually , however , we plan to include fluctuations using rg - techniques  @xcite .",
    "even at the mean - field level there remain some open issues .",
    "first of all , the polyakov loop potentials suggested so far , are fixed at vanishing @xmath1 . in this case , the expectation value @xmath4 of the polyakov loop operator and that of its adjoint , @xmath5 are linked by complex conjugation . at finite chemical potential",
    "this relation is lost and the effective potential depends on the two independent variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "extensions to finite @xmath1 have therefore to be carefully evaluated .",
    "moreover , the flavor and density dependence of the pure yang - mills potential has not been explored as yet .",
    "we will show that it is possible to extract the qualitative behavior in the fully coupled system by perturbative arguments , as well as physical consistency arguments .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we introduce the polyakov loop variable and discuss its effective potential derived from lattice data .",
    "the polyakov loop potential is then coupled to the quark - meson model which defines the polyakov  quark - meson model .",
    "the grand canonical thermodynamic potential of this model is derived in mean - field approximation , and the choice of model parameters is discussed .",
    "[ sec : results_thermo ] is devoted to thermodynamical applications , in particular we evaluate the pressure , quark number density and quark number susceptibility .",
    "moreover , the phase structure , i.e. the chiral and confinement - deconfinement phase transition is explored .",
    "subsequently , the influence of the polyakov loop potential on the thermodynamics is investigated and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] concluding remarks are drawn .",
    "a key observable in qcd at finite temperature is the polyakov loop .",
    "its expectation value serves as an order parameter for confinement in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the polyakov loop operator is a wilson loop in the temporal direction and reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for path - ordering and @xmath8 is the temporal component of the euclidean gauge field @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the color trace of in the fundamental representation @xmath10 is the creation operator of a static quark at spatial position @xmath11 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ensure gauge invariance of up to center elements .",
    "this goes hand in hand with the fact that the temporal or weyl gauge @xmath12 can not be achieved for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "its physical interpretation is best seen in polyakov gauge , where the temporal component of the gauge field is time - independent , @xmath13 , and is in the cartan sub - algebra ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , within this gauge the polyakov loop operator simplifies to @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "this results in a simple relation between the polyakov loop and the temporal component of the gauge field , @xmath16    the normalized polyakov loop variable @xmath17 and its hermitian ( charge ) conjugate @xmath18 are defined as the thermal expectation value of the color trace of the polyakov loop operator @xmath19 we emphasize again that the traces are taken in the fundamental representation .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 are complex scalar fields .",
    "their mean values , i.e.  the solution of the quantum equations of motion , are related to the free energy of a static , infinitely heavy test quark ( antiquark ) at spatial position @xmath11 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath17 vanishes in the confined phase where the free energy of a single heavy quark diverges . in the deconfined phase it takes a finite value",
    "the correlation function of two polyakov loop variables is related to the free energy @xmath20 of two color sources @xmath21 and @xmath22 with spatial separation @xmath23 as @xmath24 the dependence on @xmath25 allows one to extract the string tension .",
    "the cluster decomposition property ( locality ) enforces that for infinite distance the correlation between a quark and anti - quark vanishes and we arrive at @xmath26 these properties provide the polyakov criterion of confinement at finite temperature .",
    "it is linked to the center @xmath2 symmetry of the @xmath27 gauge group : a gauge transformation that is periodic up to a center element , leads to @xmath28 thus , the confining phase is center symmetric , whereas in the deconfined phase center symmetry is spontaneously broken .    in summary ,",
    "the confinement - deconfinement phase transition is characterized by the mean value @xmath29 in the confined phase and a finite non - zero value in the deconfined phase . in the presence of dynamical quarks ,",
    "the free energy of a quark - antiquark pair does not diverge anymore , and the order parameter is always non - vanishing . for finite quark chemical potential",
    "the free energies of quarks and antiquarks are different .",
    "since @xmath4 is related to the free energy of quarks and the hermitian ( charge ) conjugate @xmath30 to that of antiquarks , their modulus in general differs , i.e.  @xmath31 . in pure yang - mills theory the mean values @xmath32 , @xmath30 are given by the minima of the effective polyakov loop potential @xmath33 .",
    "it can be constructed from lattice data for the expectation values @xmath32 , @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "here we use a polynomial expansion in @xmath4 , @xmath5 up to quartic terms .",
    "this leads to an effective potential @xmath35 in terms of the moduli @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the product @xmath38 , and in @xmath39 , @xmath40 related to the @xmath41 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath42-symmetric part of @xmath43 is a ginzburg - landau type potential .    in pure yang - mills",
    "we can restrict ourselves to fields with the same modulus , @xmath44 . with this additional constraint",
    "we have @xmath45 and we can drop one of the @xmath42-invariants in the expansion . this has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite where the potential is only expanded in @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "alternatively one can use the moduli and drop the @xmath38-term .",
    "we conclude that the general effective potential in this approximation reads as @xmath46 the expansion coefficients are fixed to reproduce thermodynamic lattice results for the pure ym sector as in refs .",
    "this leads to temperature - independent coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and a temperature - dependent one @xmath49 with @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath48 .",

    "the hadronic properties of low - energy qcd with light flavors are effectively incorporated by a chiral quark - meson model . here",
    "the local @xmath27 gauge invariance of the underlying qcd is replaced by a global symmetry in the original quark - meson model which results in the loss of the confinement property .",

    "single quark states are already excited at low temperatures in the chirally broken phase , see e.g.  @xcite resulting in an unrealistic eos near the phase transition .",
    "since the constituent quark masses are much larger than that of the pion the meson dynamics dominates at low temperatures and the predictions from chiral perturbation theory are reproduced .    by combining the polyakov loop model with the qm model chiral as well as confining properties of qcd",

    "the integration over the gluonic degrees of freedom in the presence of a homogeneous background for the temporal component @xmath58 yields the polyakov loop potential and the mesonic terms of the chiral qm model .",

    "@xmath188 the coincidence of deconfinement and chiral transition at @xmath104 disappears for finite @xmath101 . the deconfinement temperature is larger than the corresponding chiral transition temperature",
    "this is an unphysical scenario because the deconfinement temperature should be smaller or equal to the chiral transition temperature . when resorting to the @xmath101-dependent @xmath189 ,  , we find coinciding transition lines for the entire phase diagram within an accuracy of @xmath190 mev . for this case",
    "the unique transition line lies slightly below the chiral one for the @xmath101-independent choice @xmath191 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram_theta0 ] .      in order to investigate the influence of the polyakov loop on the equilibrium thermodynamics we calculate several thermodynamic observables .",
    "all information of the system is contained in the grand canonical potential which is given by @xmath192 in   evaluated at the mean - field level .",
    "we begin our analysis with the pressure of the system @xmath193 .",

    "[ fig : pressure ] the pressure divided by the qcd stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) limit is shown as function of the temperature for three different quark chemical potentials .",
    "the values of the chemical potentials are chosen such that one curve runs through the critical end point ( cep ) ( @xmath186 mev ) and another curve through a first - order phase transition ( @xmath195 mev ) .",
    "the qcd pressure in the sb limit for @xmath0 massless quarks and @xmath196 massless gluons , relevant for the deconfined phase , is given by @xmath197\\ .\\ ] ] where the first term denotes the gluonic contribution and the rest involves the fermions .",
    "the pressure is suppressed in the confined phase and starts to rise when deconfinement sets in .",
    "for all @xmath140 and @xmath101 the pressure @xmath198 stays below the qcd sb limit , a feature that is also observed in lattice calculations and other non - perturbative approaches .",
    "for vanishing chemical potential the pressure is a smooth function of the temperature consistent with a crossover transition . at temperatures of twice the critical temperature the pressure reaches approximately @xmath199 of the sb limit . on the lattice",
    "two classes of data for the pressure obtained with a temporal extent @xmath200 and @xmath201 at @xmath104 are currently available both of which are not extrapolated to the continuum  @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with lattice simulations with a temporal extent of @xmath201 which is also closer to the continuum limit .",
    "this behavior is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_w_lattice ] .",
    "an increase of the chemical potential leads to an increase of the pressure as more quark degrees of freedom are active .",
    "for a certain chemical potential the crossover transition changes to a first - order phase transition . in this case",
    "the pressure has a kink at the transition point but still is a continuous function .",
    "the kink at @xmath202 mev for the @xmath203 mev curve is clearly visible fig .",

    "this results in a jump of the entropy density @xmath204 , which is defined as the negative derivative of the grand canonical potential with respect to the temperature .",
    "it is identical to the temperature derivative of the pressure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] we show @xmath204 divided by the corresponding qcd sb limit for the same chemical potentials as in the preceding figure .    the low- and high - temperature behavior of this quantity can be understood in a similar fashion as those of the pressure .",
    "it is continuous in the vicinity of the crossover transition and reaches less than @xmath205 of the sb limit around these temperatures .",
    "for chemical potential values larger than the critical one a finite latent heat emerges which further increases with the chemical potential .",
    "another quantity that is accessible in lattice qcd at finite chemical potential is the pressure difference @xmath206 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath207 and is taylor - expanded around @xmath104 in powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath208 on the lattice . because odd derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath101 vanish only even powers appear in this expansion . in our model",
    "we have computed the pressure difference without referring to an expansion .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure_diff ] the scaled pressure difference @xmath209 versus temperature for three chemical potential values is shown .",
    "the bottom curve corresponds to @xmath210 mev .",
    "it is always a continuous function and shows a kink at a first - order phase transition .",
    "@xmath206 rises steeply across the chiral transition and peaks almost at the same temperature for all chemical potentials . for larger temperatures it decreases almost as @xmath211 which follows from the sb limit",
    "nevertheless , due to the @xmath140- and @xmath101-dependent polyakov fields slight deviations of the @xmath211 sb behavior are seen .",
    "another interesting observable is the net quark density .",
    "it is obtained from the thermodynamic potential via @xmath212 .",
    "the quark density , normalized to @xmath213 , is displayed as a function of the temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_density ] for three different chemical potentials @xmath214 and @xmath215 mev .    in comparison to the pure quark - meson model without the polyakov loop",
    "the quark density in the confined phase is much more suppressed when the interaction of quarks with the polyakov loop is added  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the pnjl model  @xcite . above the phase transition , the quark density of the pure quark - meson model approaches the stefan - boltzmann limit @xmath216 immediately .",
    "with the polyakov loop dynamics this behavior is changed drastically .",
    "the quark densities increase slightly above the corresponding sb limits and decrease again with growing temperature . for high temperatures the sb limit of the quark density",
    "is always reached from above . at a first - order phase transition @xmath217 jumps and drops immediately after the transition for increasing temperatures .",
    "the quark number susceptibility measures the static response of the quark number density to an infinitesimal variation of the quark chemical potential and is given by @xmath218 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : suscept ] as a function of temperature for several @xmath101 .",
    "this observable can be used to verify the existence and location of the critical end point in the phase diagram .",
    "at a first - order phase transition this quantity has a discontinuity and only at a second - order critical end point it is divergent . even for finite pion masses",
    "the critical point is of second - order and induces a divergent quark number susceptibility .",
    "this behavior is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : suscept ] . for @xmath219",
    "mev , close to the critical chemical potential , @xmath220 diverges at the critical temperature .",
    "the modifications caused by the quark - gluon interaction on the quark number susceptibility , are similar as those already discussed in the context of the quark number density .",
    "compared to the pure quark - meson model @xmath220 is again more suppressed below the chiral phase transition . above the transition @xmath220 lies above the corresponding sb limit @xmath221 . at high temperatures",
    "the sb limit ( not shown in the figure ) is again reached from above .",
    "in the present paper we have extended the @xmath59 quark - meson model to include certain aspects of gluon dynamics via the polyakov loop .",
    "this pqm model combines important symmetry aspects in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks with those of the light quark sector of nearly massless up- and down quarks . within the mean - field approximation",
    "we have discussed the ensuing phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in the grand canonical ensemble , as was done previously in a similar extension of the njl model @xcite .",
    "one of the benefits is an improvement of the thermodynamical behavior of several bulk quantities such as pressure , entropy etc . when compared to lattice data . as a novelty we propose to include the @xmath0 and @xmath101 dependence of the the running coupling @xmath72 in the parameter of the polyakov loop potential .",
    "a qualitative estimate is provided by the one loop @xmath75-function for the gauge coupling @xmath72 as well as using the hard dense loop approximation .",
    "then we are led to a @xmath0 and @xmath101 dependent @xmath74 , the critical temperature of the polyakov loop model , which decreases with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath101 .",
    "these modifications already involve coinciding peaks in the temperature derivative of the polyakov loop expectation value and the chiral condensate at @xmath104 , in agreement with the lattice findings of  @xcite .",
    "interestingly this coincidence of the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration persists at finite @xmath101 .",
    "the findings of the present work provide a promising starting point for a functional rg study in the present model @xcite , and further extensions towards full qcd : in particular , we aim at removing the perturbative nature of the above estimates as well as allowing for a fully coupled pqm model .",
    "the last step consists of including the full gauge dynamics .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the important issue of the polyakov loop potential at finite @xmath101 , being intimately related to the open question of the existence and location of the critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
