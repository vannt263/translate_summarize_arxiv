    "precoding techniques can improve performance through the use of channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "several precoding methods use csit and achieve diversity benefits , but compromise on the achieved rate ; e.g. , only one symbol per channel use is achieved in transmit beamforming @xcite .",
    "it is desirable that precoding methods achieve high rates ( preferably the full rate of @xmath2 symbols per channel use as in v - blast ) and high diversity orders ( preferably the full diversity order of @xmath1 ) symbols per channel use regardless of the number of receive antennas , and ` full diversity ' is defined as @xmath1th diversity . ] with partial csit .",
    "our work reported in this paper addresses this problem .",
    "a vast body of research in the literature has addressed the problem of mimo precoding . in particular , precoding using partial csit / limited feedback has been of interest because providing full csit ( which refers to the full knowledge of all the channel gains between transmit and receive antennas ) through feedback can be too expensive @xcite-@xcite .",
    "precoding in spatial multiplexing ( v - blast ) systems has been considered for achieving high rates and transmit diversity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "precoding schemes in @xcite-@xcite incur some loss in rate .",
    "for example , the grassmannian subspace packing based precoding in @xcite does not allow simultaneous transmission of more than @xmath5 streams ( i.e. , achievable rate is @xmath13 symbols per channel use ) .",
    "the precoding scheme in @xcite achieves full rate asymptotically symbols per @xmath14 channel uses in @xmath15 system , which achieves close to full rate ( of @xmath16 for large number of channel uses . ]",
    "using d - blast architecture with partial csit , but achieves full diversity only for @xmath17 and less diversity orders for other cases .",
    "other recent works have proposed to improve the diversity gain of singular value decomposition ( svd ) precoding symbols per channel use but its diversity order is only 1 . ] by pairing good and bad subchannels , and jointly coding information across each pair of subchannels @xcite,@xcite . in the schemes in @xcite,@xcite ,",
    "though the achieved diversity orders are high , namely @xmath18 where @xmath19 is even number of streams , full diversity is not guaranteed .",
    "also , these schemes use full csit .",
    "in addition , the number of symbols transmitted per channel use @xmath19 , and so for @xmath3 full rate is not achieved .",
    "the precoding scheme in @xcite uses partial csit in the form of a single angle parameter feedback .",
    "though this scheme achieves full rate and high diversity , it failed to achieve full diversity .",
    "a summary of the required channel knowledge , achieved rates and diversity orders in various precoding schemes are given in table-[tab01 ] .",

    "we evaluated the codeword error rate ( cer ) performance of the proposed precoding scheme in asymmetric mimo systems with @xmath3 through simulations .",
    "in particular , we illustrate the cer performance of the proposed scheme for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath21 and @xmath10 full - rate mimo as a function of the average received snr per receive antenna .",
    "ml decoding is used .",

    "[ fig_2x1 ] , [ fig_3x1 ] , [ fig_4x1 ] for @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 mimo , respectively . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have plotted the cer performance and @xmath4 pdf of the full - rate precoding scheme in @xcite .",
    "we show the comparison only with @xcite because both the proposed scheme and the scheme in @xcite achieve the full rate of @xmath2 symbols per channel use in @xmath3 asymmetric mimo . whereas , the other precoding schemes in table-1 lose rate and do not achieve full rate of @xmath2 symbols per channel use in @xmath3 asymmetric mimo .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_2x1 ] , cer plots for the rates of 3 and 6 bits / channel use are shown . for 3 bits / cu , the constellation points used in the simulation for the proposed scheme are as given in the entries of @xmath24 and 1 bit / symbol modulation in table-2 .",
    "likewise , for 6 bits / cu , the constellation points used are from the @xmath24 and 2 bits / symbol modulation in table-2 .",
    "appropriate constellations from table-2 are used for the plots of different rates shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_3x1 ] and [ fig_4x1 ] .",
    "since constellation optimization is not done in the precoding scheme in @xcite , we have used regular modulation alphabets ( e.g. , bpsk , 4-qam ) and matched the bits / cu in both schemes for fair comparison .",
    "for example , 6 bits / cu plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_2x1 ] for the scheme in @xcite is simulated using 4-qam .    from the cer plots of in figs .",
    "[ fig_2x1 ] to [ fig_4x1 ] , we can see that the proposed precoding achieves better diversity orders compared to the precoding scheme in @xcite . indeed , as predicted by the analysis , the proposed scheme achieves the full diversity of @xmath25 in figs .",
    "[ fig_2x1 ] , [ fig_3x1 ] and [ fig_4x1 ] , respectively .",
    "this can be verified by observing that pdfs of the @xmath26 in the proposed scheme match with the theoretical @xmath27 pdf ( chi square distribution with @xmath6 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig_3x1 ] , the proposed scheme s pdf matches with that of the @xmath28 pdf , verifying the achievability of @xmath29th order diversity .",
    "similar matches with chi square distribution are observed in other figures as well .",
    "thus , the analytical claim of full diversity of @xmath1 in the proposed precoding scheme is validated through simulations as well .",
    "it is further noted that the pdfs in the scheme in @xcite do not match with those of the theoretical @xmath27 pdfs , indicating that the scheme in @xcite does not achieve full diversity .",
