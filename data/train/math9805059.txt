    "the quotient problem for @xmath29 of type @xmath7 with respect to the full group @xmath28 is however the generic one and indispensable .",
    "unfortunately the by now standard geometric invariant theory ( git ) does nt provide a direct answer for these quotient problems in case @xmath34 is not reductive .",
    "there are several papers dealing with the action of an arbitrary algebraic group like @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and older ones , but their results are insufficient for the above problem .",
    "the conditions of @xcite are close to what we need , but they do nt allow a concrete description of the set of semi ",
    "stable points in our case and they do nt guarantee good or projective quotients , see remark [ fauntleroy ] .    the main idea +",
    "our procedure is very close to standard git and we finally reduce the problem of the quotient to the one of a reductive group action . we introduce polarizations @xmath35 of tuples of rational numbers for the action of @xmath6 on the affine space in analogy to the ones of a. king in @xcite , which are refinements of the polarizations by ample line bundles on the projective space @xmath36 , and then introduce open sets @xmath37 of stable and semi  stable points depending on @xmath38 and study the quotient problem for these open subsets .",

    "however , in contrast to the reductive case , good quotients @xmath40 do nt exist for all polarizations , see [ prem_ex ] . as a main achievement we are providing numerical conditions on the polarizations , depending on the dimensions of the spaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 , under which such quotients exist .",
    "the main step for that is to embed the group actions @xmath41 into an action @xmath42 of a reductive group @xmath43 and to compare the open sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a polarization for the @xmath43action associated to @xmath38 .",

    "we use then the numerical criterion of a. king , @xcite , as definition for semi  stability with respect to the reductive group @xmath52 .",

    "we thus have open subsets @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    _",
    "the main result of our paper is that there are sufficient numerical and effective bounds for the polarizations @xmath38 such that @xmath44 admits a good and even projective quotient @xmath40 and that in addition @xmath71 admits a geometric quotient , which is smooth and quasi  projective , see proposition [ goodqu ] and the results [ sone ] , [ equality ] , and section 8 .",
    "_    the definitions of good and geometric quotients are recalled in [ constquot ] . by using correspondences between spaces of morphisms , called _ mutations _ , it is possible to deduce from our results other polarizations such that there exists a good projective quotient ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all this is achieved by embedding the action @xmath72 into an action @xmath73 of a reductive group and then imposing conditions for the equality @xmath74 , where @xmath46 is the associated polarization .",

    "the idea of embedding the non  reductive action @xmath72 into the action @xmath77 is simply to replace the @xmath13 by @xmath78 using the evaluation maps @xmath79 .",
    "it is explained in [ motiv ] and [ remmotiv ] that this is the outcome when we start to replace the sheaves @xmath13 step by step and similarly for the sheaves @xmath14 .",
    "since we have to deal everywhere with the dimensions of the vector spaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 which form the components of the unipotent group @xmath82 , we have translated the whole setup into an abstract multilinear setting and related actions by technical reasons .",

    "the reader should always keep in mind the motivation in [ motiv ] .",
    "the results obtained in the simplest case ( morphisms of type ( 2,1 ) or ( 1,2 ) ) are stated in [ result-2 - 1 ] .",
    "they are characteristic for the general case in which only the conditions are more complicated .",
    "remark on finite generatedness + one would expect that the quotients of @xmath83 could be obtained by first forming the quotient @xmath84 with respect to the unipotent radical @xmath82 and then in a second step a quotient of @xmath84 by @xmath85 .",

    "of course , the main difficulty also in this paper arises from the presence of the group @xmath82 .",
    "the counterexample of m.nagata , @xcite , also shows that the finite generatedness depends on the dimensions of the problem .",
