    "shear turbulence is generally the main mixing process of chemical elements .",

    "however , we found that meridional circulation is strongly enhanced by solid body rotation , since uniform rotation creates a strong breakdown of radiative equilibrium .    in evolutionary models with magnetic field and meridional circulation , there is a strong interplay between meridional circulation and magnetic field ( ( * ? ? ? * maeder & meynet 2005 ) ) : +    * differential rotation creates the magnetic field . *",
    "magnetic field tends to suppress differential rotation . *",
    "a rotation close to uniform strongly enhances meridional circulation .",

    "models show that the high enrichments in magnetic stars with a dynamo ( sect .",

    "thus , it is not the magnetic field itself which makes the mixing , but the thermal instability associated to the solid rotation created by the field . _",
    "the high surface magnetic field of these stars , which likely have a significant mass loss , produces a strong magnetic braking , which implies that these stars will reach a rather low rotation velocities during their evolution .",
    "the braking would tend to produce some internal differential rotation .",
    "however , the magnetic coupling is certainly strong enough to maintain a rotation law close to uniform , as illustrated by the models .",
    "the major question concerning magnetic fields and stellar evolution is whether a dynamo operates in radiative zones of differentially rotating stars .",
    "a magnetic field has great consequences on the evolution of the rotation velocity by exerting an efficient torque able to impose a nearly uniform rotation .",
    "this influences all the model outputs ( lifetimes , chemical abundances , tracks , chemical yields , supernova types ) as well as the rotation in the final stages , white dwarfs , neutron stars or black holes .",
    "here we first examine some general equations implied by any dynamo .",
    "the particular properties of the tayler  spruit ( ts ) dynamo have been studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spruit ( 2002 ) ) and we are using many of the equations he derived .",
    "spruit considered the radiative zones in two cases , 1 ) when the @xmath21gradient dominates , and 2 ) when the @xmath21gradient is negligible .",
    "the more general equations of the ts dynamo have been developed by ( ( * ? ? ? * maeder & meynet 2005 ) ) .",

    "* braithwaite ( 2006 ) ) and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brun et al . ( 2007 ) ) confirm the existence of tayler s instability .",
    "braithwaite also finds the existence of a dynamo loop in agreement with spruit s analytical developments .",
    "however , zahn et al . do not find the dynamo loop proposed by spruit and question what may close the loop .",
    "if a dynamo is working in a differentially rotating radiative zone , it is governed by some general relations expressing the order of magnitude of its various properties .",
    "first , the rate of magnetic energy production @xmath22 per unit of time and volume must be equal to the rate @xmath23 of dissipation of rotational energy by the magnetic viscosity @xmath24 .",
    "we assume here that the whole energy dissipated is converted into magnetic energy .",
    "the differential motions are those of the shellular rotation with an angular velocity @xmath25 , so that the velocity difference at radius @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "the amount of energy corresponding to a velocity difference @xmath28 during a time @xmath29 for an element of matter @xmath30 in a volume @xmath31 is @xmath32    because the viscous time @xmath29 over @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the magnetic energy density is @xmath35 , it is produced within the characteristic growth time of the magnetic field @xmath36 , thus the rate @xmath22 of magnetic energy creation by units of volume and time is @xmath37    where we have used the expression of the alfvn frequency @xmath38 .",
    "now , let us assume @xmath39 , i.e. that the excess of energy in the differential rotation ( compared to an average constant rotation ) is converted to magnetic energy by unit of time .",
    "this gives the following expression for the viscosity coefficient of magnetic coupling @xmath40    this is the coefficient which intervenes in the expression for the transport of angular momentum , in the lagrangian form as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) below .",
    "let us note that compared to the energy available for the solar dynamo driven by convection , the amount of energy available from differential rotation is very limited .",
    "a dynamo needs both the @xmath41effect and @xmath42effect .",
    "the @xmath41effect consists in the generation of a poloidal field component from the horizontal component . in the sun , the @xmath41effect",
    "is created by the convective motions and by the twisting of the magnetic loop by the coriolis force .",
    "however , other instabilities with a vertical component may produce the necessary @xmath41effect .",
    "the @xmath42effect consists mainly of the stretching of a small radial field component in the east  west directions .",
    "the winding  up of the field lines generates a stronger horizontal field component , converting some kinetic energy into magnetic energy .",
    "if due to an instability in radiative layers , some vertical displacements ( necessary for the @xmath41effect ) with an amplitude @xmath43 occur around an average stable position , the restoring buoyancy force produces vertical oscillations with a frequency equal to the brunt ",
    "vaisala frequency @xmath44 .",
    "the restoring oscillations will have an average density of kinetic energy @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . in order to produce a vertical displacement",
    ", the magnetic field must overcome the buoyancy effect . in terms of energy densities",
    ", this is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 has been given in the previous section .",
    "otherwise the restoring force of gravity would counteract the magnetic instability at the dynamical timescale . from this condition ,",

    "if , @xmath50 , we have the condition ( ( * ? ?",
    "* spruit 2002 ) ) @xmath51    where @xmath26 is the radius at the considered level in the star .",
    "the stretching of the field lines for the @xmath42effect is governed by the induction equation    @xmath52    an unstable vertical displacement of size @xmath53 from the azimuthal field of lengthscale @xmath26 and intensity @xmath54 also feeds a radial field component @xmath55 .",
    "the relative sizes of these two field components are defined by the induction equation ( [ inducequ ] ) , which gives the following scaling over the time @xmath56 characteristic of the unstable displacement , @xmath57    for the maximum displacement @xmath58 given by eq .",
