    "as lep2 approaches the 200 gev centre - of - mass energy regime , the need for reliable calculations of the so - called signal cc03 and general background processes in @xmath19 becomes more and more immediate .",
    "moreover , with the added need for the accommodation of arbitrary detector cuts in these calculations , the only practical solution is the monte carlo event generator realization of the calculation , wherein these cuts may be imposed on an event - by - event basis . in the present paper ,",
    "we provide , in version 1.42 of the program koralw  @xcite such an event generator in which all relevant @xmath16-@xmath17 processes , both charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) ones , in @xmath20 , in the lep2 200 gev regime are realized in the presence of the yfs  @xcite exponentiated initial - state multiple photon radiation ( isr ) .",
    "more precisely , in the @xmath18 sector this version of the program has as its ultimate objective the sub - per - cent precision regime of @xmath21 as called for in the lep2 workshop report of ref .",
    "thus , when compared with version 1.02  @xcite , the inclusion of the @xmath16-@xmath17 background processes for the @xmath19 signal is an essential improvement .",
    "this is described in detail in section 3 .",
    "in addition , new physics anomalous couplings are now featured for the cc03 class of graphs ",
    "these were absent from version 1.02 .",
    "the isr is now calculated through the @xmath0 ll in the yfs exponentiated framework ; in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was only calculated through the @xmath22 ll in the same framework .",
    "the coulomb correction is now implemented in a way that is more reliable near the threshold , following the authors of ref .",
    "the leading qcd correction , as well as the ckm matrix , is now featured following ref .  @xcite ; in version 1.02 , these corrections are absent .",
    "two other effects featured in the current version , which are missing in version 1.02 , are the colour reconnection effect , which we model after ref .",
    "@xcite , and the bose - einstein effect , which we take after the authors of ref .",
    "in addition , three choices of renormalization scheme are available",
    ". considerable technical precision checks of the program have been made , using semi - analytical results as described below , so that we have established the technical precision of the program at the level of @xmath23 .",
    "the primary missing ingredient for the final step to a total precision tag of @xmath24 is the implementation of the exact @xmath25 electroweak corrections for the cc03 class of graphs in the yfs exponentiated framework , with the consequent intermediate - state @xmath26 soft radiative effects , as we have already published using the program yfsww3 - 1.11 in ref .",
    "these effects will be incorporated in a later version of koralw  @xcite . as a result of the studies done in refs .",
    "@xcite and for the preparation the current paper , we can already safely set , in the current version 1.42 of koralw , the precision tag for the cross section normalization , for the process @xmath19 , to @xmath27 in the lep2 energy regime , where it is understood that a cut of some type is used to define the two @xmath14 s .",
    "the same @xmath27 precision tag should remain valid also for the @xmath28-@xmath28 physics , even though a formal study is missing .",
    "this , however , may not be true in general @xmath16-@xmath17 final - state processes . here , the precision may depend very much on a particular final state under consideration , a choice of physical observables , experimental cuts , events selection criteria , etc .",
    "thus , it requires a more dedicated study .",
    "the most problematic are the processes with electron(s ) and/or positron(s ) in the final state , particularly when regions of small scattering angles are allowed ( e.g. selection criteria allow some of the particles to be lost in the beam pipe ) and/or events with high-@xmath29 photons are accepted .",
    "various problems that can be encountered there are discussed in some detail in subsections [ cuts ] and [ nonisr ] .",
    "nevertheless , at the born level , our program can be used in all regions of the phase space , including the most singular ones .",
    "also , an important technical step has been achieved , which is indispensable for a reliable solution of bremsstrahlung implementation in the general case .",
    "let us also point out that contributions of the @xmath16-@xmath17 processes from some regions of the phase space are implicitly included in @xmath30-@xmath17 generators as a part of radiative corrections ( analytically cancelled out with the leading @xmath22 virtual corrections ) .",
    "one needs to be cautious about this point so as to avoid double counting .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we present in detail the overall structure of the program in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we fully describe the 4-fermion phase - space generation and the corresponding matrix elements used in the calculations of the program , the generation of the energy distribution due to isr in the program , and the semi - analytical cc03 distributions contained in the program .",
    "section 4 describes the practical use of the program , so that it should help the user to take advantage of the program s capabilities in an efficient and easy manner .",
    "appendices contain useful technical information on the construction and use of the program , its matrix elements , its input / output , etc .",
    "in this section we provide the reader with a brief guide of the koralw program .",
    "we will describe its main routines , libraries and interfaces .",
    "we want to note here that the program , in its distribution version , is prepared for a unix - type operating system that supports directories and make command .",
    "namely , we have divided the source code into a number of subdirectories , in order to make the structure more transparent and easier to handle .",
    "also the structure of makefile - s is provided , for easier compilation , as well as some other auxiliary functions ( e.g. clean - up ) .",
    "this structure , which is in fact not very complicated , can be in principle avoided and code can be transformed into a single fortran file .",
    "some care must be taken while handling the ampli4f.grc.all routines where certain include files with the same name , have different contents in different subdirectories .",
    "also , note that the following three directories : ampli4f , ampli4f.grc.all and ampli4f.grc.all-old are mutually exclusive , i.e.  they contain three versions of the same routines and only one at a time can be used by the program .      dummy directory for the external matrix element library , to be filled in by the user .",
    "the front - end routines ampini and amp4f are expected by koralw to be put here by the user .",
    "we expect the user to replace this directory with his / her own code , e.g. with their favourite parametrization of anomalous couplings .",
    "an implemented library of external matrix elements for all four - fermion final states has been generated by the grace v.  2 package @xcite .",
    "this dedicated code has been provided for koralw with the courtesy of the minami - tateya group of kek .",
    "the directory amp4f contains routines for the actual computation of matrix elements .",
    "the auxiliary library is located in the directory channel .",
    "the routines specific to koralw , which transmit and reset parameters and dip - switches of grace routines are located in the directory grc4f_init .",
    "finally , the front - end routines ampini and amp4f are in the amp4f directory .      an old version for explanation why we have decided to keep this `` old '' package . ] of the library of external matrix elements for all @xmath18-type final states , generated by the grace v.  1 package @xcite .",
    "this library contains all the scripts capable of building the fortran code from scratch with the help of the symbolic package grace .",
    "the scripts are located in the subdirectory grace4f_init .",
    "all of the fortran files and directories created by the scripts can be identified by the word expression `` .auto . '' in their names .",
    "similarly , the template files used by the scripts are marked with the word expression `` .template . '' .",
    "this subdirectory contains two demonstration subprograms : kwdemo and kwdemo2 .",
    "generally the user is supposed to provide his / her own main program .",
    "nevertheless the two subprograms quoted here are simple examples of a main program .",
    "kwdemo is the first of them .",
    "it has a double role as a useful template and as a first cross - check that the mc generator koralw runs correctly on a given installation .",
    "the essential part of this program is a loop in which a series of koralw events is generated .",
    "it also reads the input from a disk file , but no histogramming is performed and most of output is from the generator itself . at the end of the program ,",
    "a mc integrated cross section of koralw is compared with a semi - analytical result from korwan .",
    "the program is compiled / linked and executed , with the help of the makefile , for two data sets , as follows : make kwdemocc03 and make kwdemogrcall .",
    "the two data sets for the two separate runs are :    * demo.14x/190gev / kwdemo.input.cc03 for which the cc03 `` signal '' process is simulated ( internal matrix element ) , the isr is on , with hadronization , tau decays , no ckm mixing , weighted events . *",
    "kwdemo.input.grcall for all four - fermion matrix elements form grace ( external me ) , hadronization , tau decays , weighted events .",
    "kwdemo2 is the second example .",
    "apart from the loop in which series of koralw events is produced the example of _ histogramming _ with proper normalization is also included .",
    "it is done in the subprogram robol .",
    "the program is compiled / linked and executed , with the help of the makefile , for two data sets , as follows : make kwdemo2hadr and make kwdemo2semi .",
    "the two data sets provided for the two separate runs are :    * kwdemo2.input.hadr cc03 `` signal '' process is simulated , ( internal matrix element ) , the isr is on , all four - quark channels only  selected with umask matrix ( see appendix b for a definition ) , wtmain = 1 events . *",

    "it is used by koralw both for hard - coded internal bookkeeping and for some optional `` external '' tests .",
    "the package is similar in its usage to the classic hbook package of cernlib .",
    "interfaces to external libraries are collected in this directory .    1 .",
    "tohep fills in the /hepevt/ common block , decays @xmath15 leptons ( with tauola ) and generates bremsstrahlung in @xmath14 decays as well as secondary decays ( with photos ) .",
    "tohad does the hadronization ( with the help of jetset ) along with necessary colour ( re)connection .",
    "the interface to the external matrix elements is provided by the routines ampinw and ampext .",
    "the first performs the necessary initializations .",
    "it calls the user - supplied initialization routine ampini .",
    "some additional parameters ( apart from xpar ) can be reached by the user with the help of masow and kwparm2 routines .",
    "the ampext transmits to koralw the value of the external matrix element that it calculates by a call to the user - supplied routine amp4f .",
    "it also allows , with the help of the dip - switch key_cms_eff , choosing the four - vectors supplied for this calculation to be in the lab or effective cms ( default ) frames .      jetset v. 7.4 @xcite and photos @xcite",
    "are located here .",

    "the `` model '' weights are calculated here .    1",
    ".   the cc03 matrix element is calculated by wwborn .",

    "these massless four - vectors are transmitted to wwborn_massless that does the actual calculation with the help of the wwprod and wdecay routines . if anomalous couplings are requested the wwamgc routine is called instead of wwprod .",
    "the isr photonic corrections ( the so - called beta - functions ) up to the third order are provided by the routine betar , which in turn calls the d_isr * routines to construct the actual real and virtual bremsstrahlung contributions .",

    "for the total @xmath33 with isr , korwan integrates yfspho and , in the case of no radiation , @xmath33 is provided by the function xsmuta ; this in turn integrates the d1muta , which integrates d2muta , the actual two - dimensional differential cross - section .",

    "<S> _ nature of the physical problem : _ the @xmath14-pair production and decay is and will be used as an important data point for precise tests of the standard electroweak theory at lep2 and higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> the effects due to background processes , qed bremsstrahlung and apparatus efficiency have to be subtracted from the data . </S>",
    "<S> the program deals with all @xmath2 processes leading to 4-fermion final states accompanied with multiphoton initial - state radiation . </S>",
    "<S> it also includes the effects of the coulomb correction , ` naive ' qcd , anomalous couplings , quarks hadronization , @xmath15 decays , and photon radiation in leptonic decays .    </S>",
    "<S> _ method of solution : _ the monte carlo methods are used to simulate all 4-fermion final - state processes in the @xmath2 collisions in the presence of multiphoton initial - state radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is described in the framework of the yfs exclusive exponentiation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14-pair production is included in a ` natural ' way as a subset of the feynman diagrams for the above processes , but it can also be generated exclusively by switching to the so - called cc03 process . </S>",
    "<S> the monte carlo generation is done on an event - by - event basis , with constant or variable weights , where an event is represented by flavours and four - momenta of all respective particles  supplemented with a collection of weights , if the variable weight option is chosen . after the event generation is completed the program </S>",
