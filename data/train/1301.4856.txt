    "it consists of the b0  iiie optical companion hde245770 @xcite and a pulsating neutron star of spin period @xmath2s , in an eccentric orbit ( @xmath3 ) of period of @xmath4days @xcite .",
    "the system presents different luminosity states associated with the activity of the be star : quiescence , with x - ray luminosities @xmath5 @xcite , normal ( type i ) outbursts , with luminosities @xmath6 , and giant ( type ii ) outbursts , that can reach luminosities @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a0535 + 26 presents two cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsfs or cyclotron lines ) in its x - ray spectrum at @xmath846 and @xmath8100kev ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "cyclotron lines are caused by resonant scattering of photons off electrons in the quantized landau levels , and the cyclotron line energy is proportional to the magnetic field strength , @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some accreting x - ray pulsars present a negative correlation between the cyclotron line centroid energy and the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , 4u0115 + 64 , v0332 + 53 , see @xcite ) .",
    "other sources , like herx-1 , gx304@xmath101 , and swiftj1626.6@xmath105156 show the opposite trend ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this bimodality is probably due to two different accretion regimes depending on the critical luminosity @xmath11 . for sources with @xmath12 ( _ supercritical _ sources ) , a radiative shock decelerates the infalling matter , with the height of the emission region increasing with increasing mass accretion rate , explaining the negative correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the x - ray luminosity . on the other hand , for sources with @xmath13 ( _ subcritical _ sources ) ,",
    "coulomb interactions stop the infalling matter , and the height of the emission region decreases with increasing accretion rate , explaining the positive correlation observed ( further details in @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to these sources , for a0535 + 26 no significant correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the x - ray luminosity has been observed @xcite , with the exception of a flaring episode during the onset of a normal outburst observed in 2005 during which the cyclotron line energy significantly increased ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these results refer to pulse phase averaged spectroscopy ; see however @xcite for pulse - to - pulse analysis in which a positive correlation between the flux and the cyclotron line energy was observed .",
    "a0535 + 26 showed a giant outburst and a series of normal ones in 2009 , all of them associated with the periastron passage of the neutron star @xcite .",

    "in addition , the h@xmath32 ew and v - band brightness showed an anti - correlation before the 2009 giant outburst @xcite .",
    "this indicates that a mass ejection event took place before the giant outburst , producing a low - density region in the inner part of the disk that could explain the double - peaked profile @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite reported a similar h@xmath32 ew and v - band brightness evolution before the 1994 outburst , when two double - peaked outbursts took place before the giant one @xcite .",
    "such an anticorrelation was not observed before the 2005 giant outburst , that took place without precursor outbursts .",
    "double - peaked light curves have recently been observed in other sources , for instance gx304@xmath101 @xcite and xte j1946 + 274 @xcite . while the spectral shape again remained relatively constant over the outburst for the latter ,",
    "this is a special case , since two outbursts per orbit are observed .",
    "in the case of gx304@xmath101 the double - peaked outburst took place before a giant one , similar to what has been observed for a0535 + 26 , suggesting that double - peaked outbursts could be indicators of upcoming giant outbursts @xcite .",

    "while in the case of a0535 + 26 the two peaks reached a similar flux level , in the case of gx304@xmath101 the second peak reached a flux two times higher than the first one .",
    "the intensities of the two peaks were @xmath61countss@xmath16@xmath17 ( @xmath8445mcrab ) at mjd 56075 and @xmath62countss@xmath16@xmath17 ( @xmath8891mcrab ) at mjd 56087 , with a flux between the two peaks that dropped down to @xmath63countss@xmath16@xmath17 ( @xmath895mcrab ) at mjd 56082 .",
    "note that the distances of the two sources are rather similar , with gx304@xmath101 being at @xmath64kpc @xcite .",
