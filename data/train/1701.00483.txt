    "the understanding and control of the decay process of an unstable state coupled to a continuum has long been a subject of great relevance in different areas of quantum and classical physics , ranging from quantum mechanics @xcite to statistical physics @xcite , atomic and molecular physics @xcite , optics @xcite , quantum thermodynamics @xcite and cosmology @xcite to mention a few .",
    "+ the ability of controlling , slowing down or even suppressing the decay process has attracted great interest for both fundamental aspects and practical applications . in quantum physics , it is well known that the decay of a metastable state can be slowed down and even frozen by frequent observations of the system as a result of the reduction ( collapse ) postulate @xcite .",
    "however , if the measurements are not rapid enough , the opposite effect can occur , that is , the observations can actually accelerate quantum decay @xcite .",
    "such effects , known as the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects , have attracted great interest both theoretically and experimentally due their relevance to the foundations of quantum mechanics and for their potential applications to quantum technologies .",
    "a generalization of the quantum zeno effect occurs for frequent projections onto a multidimensional subspace , thereby the system can evolve away from its initial state , although it remains in the subspace defined by the measurement @xcite .",
    "control of quantum decay can be achieved without resorting to the reduction postulate , i.e. without any measurement @xcite . if the coupling with the continuum is properly tailored in time , thus keeping a unitary dynamics , dynamical quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects can be obtained .",
    "dynamical decoupling methods include the `` bang - bang '' control schemes , based on very rapidly and strongly driving pulses @xcite , and the periodic modulation of the coupling to the continuum @xcite .",
    "dynamical decoupling methods can be applied to control mascroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite and the escape dynamics in classical optical structures @xcite .",
    "quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects and their classical analogues have been studied and observed in many different physical setups such as cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , spin systems @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite , classical optical systems @xcite and in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , with potential applications to decoherence suppression @xcite , entanglement generation @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , and quantum imaging @xcite .    in such previous studies ,",
    "the problem of the quantum mechanical decay of a metastable state to a continuum has been mostly considered in the framework of standard quantum mechanics , which sets the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the full system to be an hermitian operator . however , a rapidly growing interest is currently devoted to the dynamics of non - hermitian quantum and classical systems @xcite , especially those possessing parity - time ( @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "recent works investigated theoretically some extensions of the decay dynamics in systems described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite , predicting the existence of bound states either outside or embedded into the continuum @xcite and the absence of quantum decay for a bound state with an energy embedded in an unstable continuum @xcite .",
    "in this work we theoretically investigate the decay dynamics of a discrete state which interacts for a finite time with a continuum of states via a _ non - hermitian _ coupling , and predict a novel effect which is impossible to observe in the ordinary hermitian case , namely the absence of quantum decay after discrete - continuum state interaction for a wide class of coupling temporal shapes .",
    "non - hermitian couplings have been introduced in several foundational or effective hamiltonian models in different areas of physics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "non - hermitian couplings have been introduced to describe a @xmath2-symmetric extension of the lee model in the ghost regime @xcite , non - hermitian bose - hubbard hamiltonians @xcite , and @xmath2-symmetric extensions of the jaynes - cumming model @xcite .",
    "effective models that yield non - hermitian couplings are also encountered in the theory of the inverted quantum oscillators and quantum amplifiers @xcite and introduced in several other systems @xcite .",
    "here we consider a time - varying non - hermitian coupling of a discrete state with a continuum of states and show the absence of quantum decay for a wide class of temporal coupling shapes in which the real and imaginary parts are related each other by a hilbert transform ( kramers - kronig relations ) .",
    "the effect is illustrated by considering a paradigmatic model of a metastable state coupled to a tight - binding continuum , namely a non - hermitian fano - anderson model realized by a semi - infinite tight - binding lattice .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii the model of quantum decay of a discrete state coupled to a continuum via a time - dependent non - hermitian coupling is introduced , and an extension of the fermi golden rule in the weak - coupling ( markovian ) limit is derived , indicating the possibility of quantum decay suppression for a non - hermitian interaction with a vanishing effective interaction time .",
    "absence of quantum decay for a wide class of non - hermitian coupling functions is rigorously proven in sec.iii beyond the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "an example of quantum decay suppression via non - hermitian coupling for the fano - anderson model is illustrated in sec.iv .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are outlined in sec.v .",
    "let us consider the interaction of a discrete ( normalizable ) state @xmath3 with a continuum @xmath4 of states into which it can decay ; fig.1(a ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the system reads @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ( real ) bare energies of states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the spectral coupling function , and @xmath14 described the time - dependent strength of the interaction .",
    "we will typically assume a spectral function @xmath13 bounded from below and a finite interaction time , i.e. we assume @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "for the system initially prepared in state @xmath8 , the survival probability after the interaction with the continuum is then defined by @xmath17 . in ordinary quantum mechanics the hamiltonian @xmath0 is hermitian , which implies a coupling function @xmath14 real .",
    "in this case the survival probability @xmath18 is always smaller than one , at least for adiabatic ( slowly - varying ) amplitude @xmath14 , indicating that after the interaction the state @xmath3 can never be found in its original condition . in this work",
    "we allow the coupling function @xmath14 to become _ complex _ , i.e. with a non - vanishing imaginary part , corresponding to a _ non - hermitian _ coupling between the discrete state @xmath8 and the continuum of states @xmath4 . in this case",

    "after formal integration of eq.(4 ) with the initial condition @xmath33 , elimination of the amplitudes @xmath25 yields the following exact integro - differential equation for @xmath24 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reservoir response ( memory ) function defined by @xmath36.\\ ] ] the memory function @xmath35 vanishes as @xmath37 with a characteristic time scale @xmath38 , the memory time . for a weak coupling @xmath39 and for a coupling function @xmath14 that varies slowly over the memory time @xmath38 , eq.(6 ) can be approximated with the differential equation @xmath40 where we have set @xmath41 i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 denotes the principal value of the integral .",
    "integration of eq.(8 ) with the initial condition @xmath44 yields @xmath45 equation ( 12 ) provides an extension of the usual exponential decay law in the weak - coupling ( markovian ) limit to the case of a time - varying coupling strength @xmath14 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the ordinary decay rate and frequency shift of the metastable @xmath8 state . the survival probability in state @xmath3 after the interaction with the continuum reads @xmath48 where we have set @xmath49 as a definition of the effective interaction time .",
    "+ in the hermitian case , @xmath50 is real and positive , so that the survival probability reads @xmath51 therefore , assuming that @xmath6 is embedded into the continuous spectrum and that decay into the continuum is allowed , i.e. @xmath52 , one always has @xmath53 , i.e. there is a nonvanishing probability of decay after interaction with the continuum .",
    "+ for a non - hermitian coupling , the function @xmath14 is complex and , interestingly , the effective interaction time @xmath50 can vanish , indicating that after interaction the state @xmath3 does not decay into the continuum despite @xmath6 is embedded into the continuous spectrum .",
    "such a counterintuitive result does not depend on the particular form of the spectral coupling @xmath13 and requires @xmath54 , which can be satisfied by a broad class of complex coupling functions @xmath14 .",

    "we prove that such a result is a rather general one and holds for a coupling functions @xmath14 , which is analytic in the half lower @xmath56 ( or half upper @xmath57 ) complex plane .",
    "remarkably , the absence of the decay is observed even for strong discrete - continuum coupling and for a coupling function rapidly varying on the time scale of the memory time @xmath38 .",

    "after elimination of @xmath83 , from eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) the exact integro - differential equation for @xmath84 is readily obtained @xmath85 where @xmath35 is the memory function defined by eq.(7 ) .",

    "<S> controlling the decay dynamics of an unstable state coupled to a continuum is a longstanding problem of major interest in different areas of quantum and classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> suppression of quantum mechanical decay and slow - down of the escape dynamics in macroscopic quantum and optical tunneling via dynamical decoupling methods have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated in different physical systems over the last two decades . </S>",
    "<S> so far most of dynamical decoupling schemes have been focused to hermitian dynamics . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider the decay of an unstable state coupled to a continuum via a time - dependent _ non - hermitian _ coupling with finite ( albeit arbitrarily long ) duration , and show rather generally that for a wide class of coupling temporal shapes , in which the real and imaginary parts of the coupling are related each other by a hilbert transform , the metastable state returns to its initial condition after the interaction with the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the absence of decay holds even beyond the weak - coupling ( markovian ) limit and for arbitrarily slow ( adiabatic ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated by considering a paradigmatic example of decay dynamics of a metastable state coupled to a tight - binding continuum described by a fano - anderson model and realized by a semi - infinite tight - binding lattice . </S>",
    "<S> non - hermitian coupling can be implemented by fast modulation of the complex site energy of the edge site in the lattice . </S>"
