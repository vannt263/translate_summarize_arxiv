    "one of the primary invariants associated to a topological space are its homotopy groups . although easier to define than homology groups , these are notoriously hard to compute even for simple examples . for a simply connected space @xmath4 , all the homotopy groups are abelian . in his celebrated thesis @xcite",
    ", serre proved that @xmath5 is torsion unless @xmath6 , or when @xmath7 is even @xmath8 has a @xmath9-summand . for @xmath10",
    "this goes back to the existence of the hopf map @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , serre also showed that a simply connected , finite cw complex @xmath4 has infinitely many non - zero homotopy groups .",
    "he conjectured that such a space with non - trivial @xmath12 cohomology has the property that @xmath13 contains @xmath12 for infinitely many values of @xmath7 .",
    "this was proved later by mcgibbon and neisendorfer @xcite as an application of an amazing theorem of miller @xcite , which itself was proving a special case of the sullivan s conjecture on the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group .",
    "following serre , computing homotopy groups of spheres has been a point of widespread research .",
    "results about the homotopy groups of manifolds and associated cw complexes have also been of interest . in such cases results",
    "are typically of the form that the homotopy groups of a manifold are related to the homotopy groups of spheres via some formula . leaving aside aspherical manifolds , the real and complex projective spaces have homotopy groups which are well - understood as they support a sphere bundle whose total space is a sphere . in 1955 , hilton @xcite computed the homotopy of groups of a finite wedge of spheres , as a direct sum of homotopy groups of spheres .",
    "the various spheres were mapped to the wedge by iterated whitehead products inducing a decomposition of the ( based ) loop space . in 1972 , milnor s unpublished note @xcite generalized hilton s result to prove that the loop space of the suspension of a wedge of spaces can be written as an infinite product of loop spaces of suspensions of smash products .",
    "this version is usually referred to as the hilton - milnor theorem .",
    "this paper deals with explicit computations of homotopy groups of certain manifolds and allied applications .",
    "our main results involve computations for @xmath0-connected @xmath1-manifolds and similar cw complexes which are next in line ( in terms of complexity of cell structures ) from a wedge of spheres .",
    "the @xmath0-connected @xmath1-manifolds were considered by wall @xcite as generalizations of simply connected @xmath14-manifolds .",
    "the theory of these four manifolds has in itself been a topic of considerable interest .",
    "the classification of simply connected four manifolds upto homotopy type was achieved in the early works of whitehead and milnor and the homeomorphism classification is a celebrated result of freedman .",
    "a simply connected @xmath14-manifold @xmath15 may be expressed upto homotopy as a cw complex with @xmath16 two - cells and one four - cell , where @xmath16 is the second betti number of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the homotopy groups of @xmath15 must be determined by the integer @xmath16 and the attaching map of the four - cell .",
    "curiously , if @xmath17 , one may construct a circle bundle over @xmath15 whose total space is a connected sum of @xmath18 copies of @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "it follows that the homotopy groups , upto isomorphism , depend only on the integer @xmath16 and _ not _ on the attaching map .",
    "the above arguments present us with two issues . one , whether it is possible to write down an expression for the homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres by computing the homotopy groups of the relatively explicit cw complex @xmath20 .",
    "two , the arguments used above are typically geometric relying on the classification of spin @xmath21-manifolds by smale @xcite .",
    "thus , a natural question is whether one can prove the same theorem using homotopy theoretic methods . in this paper",
    "we answer both these questions .    for the second question above ,",

    "a naive version of these ideas was used in an earlier paper @xcite .    the techniques developed to prove theorem a may be used to thoroughly analyze homotopy groups of other spaces .",

    "a dichotomy presents itself here - either the sum of the ranks of the rational homotopy groups is finite ( such spaces are called _ rationally elliptic _ ) or it is not . in the latter case ,",
    "the spaces are called _ rationally hyperbolic _ and it is known that the partial sums of the ranks of the rational homotopy groups grow at least exponentially .",
