    "several ideas have been put forward for dealing with strongly coupled theories .",
    "an early example , that works surprisingly well for qcd , is the notion of hidden local symmetry ( hls ) .",
    "take a theory with flavour symmetry @xmath9 spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath10 .",
    "the strategy is to first use low energy theorems describing the associated nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngbs ) to construct an effective , nonlinear sigma model description on the manifold @xmath11 @xcite . as it happens , this model is gauge equivalent to a linear model with flavour symmetry @xmath9 and a broken _ gauge _ symmetry @xmath10 , thus providing an alternative effective description @xcite .",
    "the broken gauge symmetry is the hls , in the sense that it was not present in the original theory but `` emerges '' in the low energy physics .",
    "a somewhat more modern tool for tackling strongly coupled theories is seiberg duality , applicable to certain @xmath12 supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite . in its default form",
    ", the duality links the low energy physics of @xmath0 sqcd with @xmath13 colours and @xmath14 flavours , with that of a second sqcd theory with @xmath15 colours , @xmath14 flavours of quark , some elementary singlets ( identified as bound state mesons ) and a yukawa coupling between them all in the superpotential .",
    "the duality also extends to @xmath6 and @xmath7 gauge groups @xcite as well as a veritable zoo of other , more intricate theories @xcite .",
    "the key feature of seiberg duality is that it is a strong - weak duality which can , in certain circumstances , yield calculable results in strongly coupled theories . in particular , choosing @xmath16 renders the original , electric theory asymptotically free and the dual , magnetic theory ir free .",
    "despite the fact that seiberg duality is well tested and well understood from a practical point of view , the question of _ why _ it exists has remained only partially answered .",
    "@xcite and , more recently , refs .",
    "@xcite reinterpreted the duality by proposing that the magnetic gauge group is in fact an hls of the electric theory . by analogy with qcd the magnetic gauge fields",
    "are then related to @xmath2-mesons of the electric theory .",
    "indeed , hints of this idea are already apparent in the flavour symmetry breaking pattern of sqcd : at a generic point in moduli space su(n+n)_lsu(n+n)_rsu(n)_lsu(n)_r , and the surviving non - abelian factors clearly have the same form as the magnetic gauge group .",
    "previous investigations of this interpretation focused mainly on the phase structure of the theory , or on the noether currents and comparison with qcd . in this article",
    "we will instead return to the full , supersymmetric hls formalism of refs .",
    "this approach yields many new results , all supporting the idea that seiberg duality is just the way that hls manifests itself in supersymmetry .",
    "a difference between seiberg duality and hls that will be central to our discussion is that , whereas the former is a duality that exists between unbroken theories , the hls is defined as a spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "the property of supersymmetric theories that allows us to reconcile this difference is that their potentials have enhanced complex flavour symmetries . as a consequence",
    "their moduli spaces contain both ngbs _ and _ quasi - ngbs , and there is a tendency for flavour symmetries to be broken by expectations of the latter .",
    "one can therefore change the pattern of flavour symmetry breaking simply by moving around the moduli space .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate what happens in the hls description at points with enhanced flavour symmetry .",
    "we will see that the previously broken hls can be ( partially ) restored .",
    "the newly massless gauge fields correspond to combinations of the ngbs that can no longer be considered ngbs at such points .",
    "this is the general mechanism connecting hls to seiberg duality , and is the focus of section [ sec : hl ] .    applying the hls formalism to sqcd ( section [ sec : hq ] ) provides an explicit realisation .",
    "we initiate the procedure at a generic point in the electric theory s moduli space , where the flavour symmetry is maximally broken , and use the hls formalism to recover the usual magnetic dual in a confined phase .",
    "the magnetic superpotential is instrumental in this result .",
    "it is required to avoid the double - counting of certain degrees of freedom , but it can also be considered as a uv completion that drives the breaking of the hls ( i.e.  the magnetic gauge symmetry ) via confinement .",
    "we find it an appealing feature of sqcd that one can identify the dynamical mechanism that breaks the hls .",
    "equivalently , one can start from the magnetic theory , drive it into a confined phase via a meson expectation and recover the electric theory as the hls description instead .",
    "regardless of which gauge group is taken to be the hls , one can smoothly scale all symmetry breaking expectations to zero by moving along the quasi - ngb direction associated with spontaneously broken @xmath1-symmetry . in this limit gauge and flavour symmetry",
    "are restored in both theories , thus recovering full seiberg duality .    after re - establishing the hls interpretation of seiberg duality",
    "we derive several new results .",
    "the mapping of electric @xmath2-mesons to magnetic gauge fields is immediate and explicit . comparing this result with a second derivation ( using noether currents and colour - flavour locking as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) allows us to fix the value of the parameter @xmath3 , analogous to that appearing in the chiral lagrangian of real world qcd . on a baryonic branch of sqcd we find @xmath4 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and on a mesonic branch @xmath5 ( consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "electric quark mass terms are easily accommodated .",
    "they reduce the size of the unbroken flavour symmetry leading to a higgsing of the magnetic gauge group .",
    "we can also fix the duality scale , which would otherwise be a free parameter , at particular points in moduli space .",
    "these results are presented in section [ sec : ch ] .    in sections 5 and [ sec :",
    "vs ] we extend the discussion in various novel directions ; section 5 discusses what can be learnt by gauging @xmath1-symmetry , and in section [ sec : vs ] we show that the hls interpretation can be straightforwardly extended to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 versions of seiberg duality , as well as adjoint sqcd .",
    "in addition to its theoretical interest , a better understanding of seiberg duality opens up several areas of application . including operators charged under the magnetic gauge group in the duality s dictionary allows us to discuss dynamical processes .",
    "this can lead to a semi - calculable description of the unitarisation of composite @xmath8 scattering . by gauging the flavour symmetry one can also interpolate continuously between higgsing / technicolour descriptions of ( supersymmetric ) electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "lessons learnt from applying the hls formalism to sqcd may help understand the reason @xmath4 is selected in real world qcd . finally we ( recklessly ) speculate that the whole procedure could be implemented as a systematic way of finding non - supersymmetric dualities .",
    "these issues are discussed in section [ sec : ap ] .",
    "consider a theory with a flavour symmetry @xmath9 broken to some subgroup @xmath10 .",
    "low energy theorems tell us that the behaviour of the associated ngbs depends not on the specifics of the theory , but only on the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath17 .",
    "any effective lagrangian that realises this provides a valid description of the underlying theory s ir physics @xcite .    in non - supersymmetric theories",
    "a general approach is to realise the flavour symmetry nonlinearly , via a sigma model description on the manifold @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this description is gauge equivalent to one with a linearly realised flavour symmetry @xmath9 and a broken gauge symmetry @xmath10 .",
    "the gauge symmetry , which is not present originally , is said to emerge as a hidden local symmetry of the underlying theory . ref .",
    "@xcite contains a comprehensive review of this idea and its application to supersymmetric theories .",
    "we begin by briefly summarising this latter aspect .",
    "susy tells us that each real ngb comes with two massless superpartners : one real scalar and one weyl fermion .",
    "the extra light scalars can be considered a direct consequence of the holomorphy of the superpotential , which elevates real constants parameterising flavour transformations to complex ones . at the superpotential level",
    "the original flavour symmetry is therefore enhanced to its complex extension @xmath18 .",
    "typically this results in more symmetry generators being broken , hence more massless scalars .    while the genuine ngbs are coordinates for the real manifold @xmath11 , the full set of massless scalars spans the larger , complex manifold @xmath19 .",
    "here @xmath20 is the complex symmetry group preserved by the moduli space of the theory .",
    "that it contains @xmath21 follows from the fact that generators of @xmath21 are constrained to be hermitian , whereas those of @xmath22 are not . thus a supersymmetric theory with flavour symmetry breaking @xmath17 can be described by a sigma model on the manifold @xmath19 .",
    "the ngbs are , of course , the usual massless scalars corresponding to the @xmath17 part of the symmetry breaking .",
    "any other massless scalars are known as quasi - ngbs and are forbidden from getting mass terms only by susy .",
    "the precise number of quasi - ngbs depends on how much bigger @xmath19 is than @xmath11 and is given by [ eq : hlnm ] n_m=-=+- .",
    "we count independent real dimensions such that @xmath23}=2\\dim{[g]}$ ] and so on .    ref .",
    "@xcite mainly studied the limiting case of @xmath24 , whereupon @xmath25 and all massless scalars are ngbs .",
    "the other extreme is @xmath26 , whereupon @xmath27}$ ] and there is a one to one correspondence between ngbs and superfields .",
    "more generally , one can separate chiral superfields into p and m - types .",
    "p - type ( or pure ) superfields have ngbs for both scalar components .",
    "m - type ( or mixed ) superfields contain one ngb and one quasi - ngb .",
    "hence @xmath28 also gives the number of m - type superfields .",
    "whatever the value of @xmath28 , one can define dimensionless superfields @xmath29 to accommodate the normalised ngbs .",
    "these are assembled into a chiral superfield matrix is used as shorthand for all superspace coordinates ] [ eq : hlxipi ] ( ) = e^(x),where(x)=^a(x)^a .",
    "the @xmath30 are the broken generators of @xmath18 and we have chosen a basis such that @xmath31 } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab } & { \\mathop{\\rm tr}\\left[\\hat{s}^{\\alpha\\dag}\\hat{s}^\\beta\\right ] } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta } & { \\mathop{\\rm tr}\\left[\\hat{t}^{a\\dag}\\hat{s}^\\alpha\\right ] } & = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for generators @xmath32 of @xmath22 . note that these generators are not necessarily hermitian for arbitrary complex groups .",
    "the scalar components of @xmath33 are by definition elements of @xmath18 , and provide standard representatives of each coset in the left coset space @xmath19 . acting on @xmath33 with a group element @xmath34 does not usually preserve this parameterisation , but instead mixes in components involving the @xmath32 via g^()=(^)^-1(,g ) for some element @xmath35 that depends on @xmath36 and @xmath37 in some complicated way .",
    "this means that @xmath33 transforms under flavour transformations according to [ eq : hlgnls ] ( ) ( ^)=g()^-1(,g ) so the flavour symmetry is realised nonlinearly .",
    "we could just as well have chosen @xmath33 to provide representatives of the _ right _ coset space @xmath19 instead , whereupon @xmath38 acts from the left and @xmath39 from the right in the above expression .    before continuing ,",
    "we briefly consider the expansion of the scalar component [ eq : hlxipis ] ( ) e^(x)e^i(x ) where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are hermitian scalar matrices . roughly speaking ,",
    "the anti - hermitian scalar part of @xmath36 contains the ngbs and provides the phase factor @xmath42 .",
    "this parameterises a nonlinear sigma model on @xmath11 ; which would have been constructed in a non - supersymmetric theory .",
    "it satisfies the constraint @xmath43 with the non - zero right hand side being a direct consequence of the symmetry breaking .",
    "meanwhile the hermitian scalar parts of @xmath36 provide @xmath40 , modifying this non - supersymmetric constraint to @xmath44 . therefore @xmath40 parameterises fluctuations in the order parameters of the symmetry breaking .",
    "that order parameters can appear as low energy degrees of freedom is a key feature of susy and , in principle , allows some of the symmetry breaking to be dialled down .",
    "it occurs because said order parameters often arise from expectations of quasi - ngbs , leading to rich structure in the low energy theory .",
    "this feature will be important when we come to discuss seiberg duality as it enables the duality to be established for unbroken , not just broken , gauge symmetries .    moving back to the task",
    "at hand we require any effective lagrangian to be invariant under the nonlinear transformation .",
    "building one is slightly trickier than in non - supersymmetric theories , mainly because @xmath45 for an arbitrary complex group .",
    "one proceeds by defining projection operators @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 for every @xmath48 .",
    "the first two expressions are generic features of such operators .",
    "the third one states that the @xmath46 projected subspace ( with @xmath46 acting from the right ) is closed under @xmath22 , i.e.[eq : hlxiheta ] _ ( ^)=(^)=g_()^-1_(,g),where^-1_(,g)=^-1(,g ) .",
    "there is one projection operator for each @xmath10-irreducible block in @xmath9 .",
    "we are now able to write down a khler potential [ eq : hlk0 ] k^s_=v_^2 for a real dimension 1 parameter @xmath49 associated with the scale of symmetry breaking in the underlying theory . because of the projection of @xmath50 and @xmath51 it is not possible to split the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic factors in the determinant.s as the resulting term in the khler potential does not contribute to the metric . ]",

    ". therefore they do not contribute to the action which is consequently invariant .",
    "any linear combination of khler potentials of this form for different projection operators thus produces a suitable effective lagrangian .",
    "the resulting description is the expected nonlinear sigma model on the complex manifold @xmath19 .",
    "we now turn to an hls description , which is a linear description of the same system based on a theory with a flavour symmetry @xmath9 and a complex gauge symmetry @xmath22 . in the wess - zumino gauge , @xmath10 gauge transformations mix with susy transformations",
    "so that the full theory has a complexified gauge group @xmath21 in superspace . ] in the hls theory , a chiral superfield @xmath33 is defined to live in a matrix representation of @xmath9 transforming as ( x)g(x)^-1(x ) .",
    "this is essentially the same variable used above , although it is now considered to be an elementary chiral superfield rather than a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the same projection operators are introduced such that _",
    "( x)g_(x)^-1_(x),where^-1_(x)=^-1(x)and we define an @xmath46 projected vector superfield @xmath54 , transforming in the usual way e^-v__(x)e^-v_^_(x ) under @xmath46 projected gauge transformations .",
    "we then write down a khler potential [ eq : hlkveta ] k^v_=v_^2 i.e.  a gauge theory with an fi - term @xmath55 and @xmath22 invariant auxiliary chiral superfield @xmath56 . one role of @xmath56 will be to ensure that any quasi - ngbs associated with the breaking of @xmath57 symmetries remain unfixed by the vector superfield equations of motion .",
    "a secondary role is clear from the fact that shifts in @xmath56 correspond to ( complexified ) gauge shifts in @xmath58 , therefore restoring the  radial \" degrees of freedom that are absent in the non - linear sigma model .",
    "we shall comment more on this later .",
    "currently there are no kinetic terms for the vector superfield .",
    "it is an auxiliary degree of freedom and one can solve the equations of motion to find [ eq : hlvsolns ] d_^(x)d_(x)e^v_=_^(x)_(x ) .",
    "( note that the equations of motion still give @xmath59 even if @xmath60 does not contain a @xmath57 subgroup such that the fi - term vanishes . ) substituting back into eq .",
    ", ignoring constant terms and a term proportional to @xmath61 ( which vanish after the superspace integration ) gives k^v_=v_^2=k^s_. note that this expression is gauge invariant even though it has no @xmath58 because of the discussion around eq .  .",
    "hence any khler potential [ eq : hlketa2 ] k_=(1-a_)v_^2+a_v_^2 for an arbitrary , real constant @xmath62 reduces to @xmath63 after solving the vector superfield equations of motion .",
    "this arbitrary constant relates the vector superfield mass to the gauge coupling @xmath64 via @xmath65 .",
    "it is analogous to the @xmath3 parameter appearing in the chiral lagrangian of regular qcd , where dynamics seems to fix its value to @xmath66 .",
    "finally , observe that the transformation properties of @xmath33 mean that it can be written in the form [ eq : hlxisigma ] ( x)=e^(x)e^(x),where(x)=^(x)^. fixing gauge such that @xmath67 ( the unitary gauge ) , @xmath33 becomes a function of @xmath36 only and is identical to its counterpart in eq .  .",
    "however , flavour transformations do not respect this choice as ( ( x))g((x))=e^^(x)e^(x ) . to maintain the gauge fixing they",
    "must be accompanied by gauge transformations ( ( x))g((x))^-1((x),g)=(^(x ) ) exactly reproducing the nonlinear transformation properties of eq .  .",
    "despite the current lack of kinetic terms for the vector superfields many examples are known in which they develop dynamically , elevating the auxiliary vector superfields into true gauge fields .",
    "alternatively one might think of the hls description without kinetic terms as being strongly coupled , with the kinetic terms being suppressed by the gauge coupling . in sqcd the appropriate interpretation will depend on where one is on the moduli space .",
    "that said , there is no symmetry stopping us adding gauge field kinetic terms to eq .   by hand",
    "this is the approach usually taken for @xmath2-mesons in real world qcd , where it is anyway expected that kinetic terms are generated dynamically .",
    "note that , for the sake of pedagogy , we have been treating the whole of @xmath22 democratically .",
    "often , different parts of @xmath22 will have different properties .",
    "for example , some of @xmath22 may be anomalous , as will turn out to be the case in sqcd .",
    "the hls formalism remains applicable but the anomaly tells us that that part of the gauge symmetry can not be restored .",
    "in other cases kinetic terms may fail to arise dynamically for some components of @xmath58 which remain as auxiliary fields .",
    "we shall continue to refer to the `` @xmath22 gauge theory '' , but bearing this in mind .",
    "in summary , the two candidate low energy descriptions , a nonlinear sigma model on the complex manifold @xmath19 and an @xmath22 gauge theory with flavour symmetry @xmath9 , are gauge equivalent to one another .",
    "the @xmath22 gauge symmetry arises as an hls and there is one vector superfield for each projection operator satisfying eq .",
    "( or @xmath10-irreducible block of @xmath9 ) .",
    "many supersymmetric theories break their flavour symmetry via quasi - ngb expectations .",
    "it is then possible to smoothly take a limit in which the symmetry is ( partially ) restored . here",
    ", we investigate in general terms how the hls description behaves in this limit",
    ". it will be an important component of our discussion of sqcd in the following section .",
    "we begin by saying a little more about the auxiliary chiral superfield @xmath56 . in the wess - zumino gauge ,",
    "the solution to the vector superfield equations of motion demands vacuum expectations [ eq : hlxiex ] _ ^(x)_(x)=d_^(x)d_(x)for the scalar components of @xmath33 .",
    "gauge symmetry breaking is thus manifest for @xmath68 : the scalar expectations provide a mass term for @xmath58 .",
    "returning to eq .",
    ", suppose there is a broken generator @xmath69 satisfying @xmath70\\eta & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equivalently , the restriction of @xmath69 to the @xmath46 projected subspace generates a complexified @xmath57 symmetry .",
    "we can pull out the associated ngb superfield to write [ eq : hlpikappa ] _ ^()_()=e^2|_(x)e^_a1^a(x)^ae^_a1^a(x)^aso",
    "the scale of @xmath71 is able to fluctuate , as parameterised by the real scalar [ eq : hlkappadef ] |_(x)=. this is simply the superpartner of the ngb for the broken @xmath57 , and evidently a quasi - ngb of the theory .",
    "as already stated , one job of @xmath56 is to ensure that the expectation of this quasi - ngb is not determined by the equations of motion . to this end , eq .",
    "fixes @xmath72 in the wess - zumino gauge .",
    "the solution to the vector superfield equations of motion becomes [ eq : hlxiex2 ] e^2|_(x)e^v_=_^(x)_(x ) with the scalar components getting expectations @xmath73 in the wess - zumino gauge as required .",
    "note that this issue is restricted to quasi - ngbs associated with complexified @xmath57 symmetries in @xmath22 , since the fi - term in the khler potential is only relevant to them . in the absence of @xmath57 symmetries in @xmath22",
    "the vector superfield equations of motion give @xmath74 but leave its overall scale unfixed .",
    "our general strategy is now to define the hls description at a point in moduli space where its gauge symmetry is broken , then use the quasi - ngb @xmath75 to move to where gauge symmetry is restored .",
    "one can not go directly to an hls description with unbroken gauge symmetry as the sigma model description , from which the hls description is derived , is not well defined at these points in moduli space .",
    "the hls description can , in fact , be considered to resolve the behaviour of the sigma model description as such points .",
    ".   implies that the expectation of @xmath50 vanishes and gauge symmetry is restored in the limit @xmath76 , i.e.  @xmath77 .",
    "however , the khler potential blows up in this limit unless we simultaneously take @xmath78 .",
    "actually , this is precisely what we should do .",
    "recall from the discussion around eq .   that @xmath75 parameterises fluctuations in the order parameter for the @xmath46 projected part of the symmetry breaking .",
    "since @xmath49 corresponds to the scale of this symmetry breaking , any scaling of @xmath79 is matched by a scaling of @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , the combination @xmath80 remains fixed .",
    "if we now define canonically normalised , dimensionful chiral superfields @xmath81 the khler potential becomes k_=(1-a_)v_^2 + up to terms that vanish after the superspace integral . in the @xmath77 limit with constant @xmath80 it dramatically simplifies to k_=.",
    "this khler potential is smooth everywhere and describes an unbroken gauge theory with massless matter , in which the @xmath46 projected part of @xmath82 is realised linearly .",
    "the normalisation of @xmath83 is determined at the point in moduli space where the hls description is first defined , then remains constant as the symmetry restoring limit is taken .",
    "hence many different normalisations lead to the same unbroken description .",
    "we will see a manifestation of this effect in seiberg duality : the duality scale @xmath84 . also note that , as mentioned earlier , the massless degree of freedom that was absent from the sigma model , corresponding to the radial mode @xmath49 , can be associated with the @xmath58 field .",
    "regardless of whether @xmath58 becomes a dynamical gauge field or remains as an auxiliary field , this degree of freedom passes to @xmath83 and @xmath85 .",
    "( in the former case we can always go to the wz gauge to make the bottom component of @xmath58 zero . )    meanwhile , in the sigma model description , the khler metric based on eq .",
    "vanishes when @xmath78 . since part of the flavour symmetry",
    "is restored in this limit , it comes as no surprise to find that a description built around a broken flavour symmetry breaks down , and one has to revert to the underlying theory with restored flavour symmetry .",
    "indeed when @xmath78 the @xmath57 symmetry is restored so there is no longer a ngb , but the scalar partner of @xmath75 stays massless due to continuity of the moduli space .",
    "the same thing happens to the ngbs of any other part of the flavour symmetry restored when @xmath78 . although the total number of massless degrees of freedom is unchanged the parameterisation used in eq .",
    "no longer makes sense .",
    "not all of the light states can be attached to a broken symmetry generator so the description is invalid .",
    "so we see that in both descriptions there are ` new ' massless degrees of freedom in the limit @xmath78 . in the hls description",
    "they are vector superfields , in the sigma model description they are former ngbs . comparing the two we therefore conjecture that hls gauge fields emerge from ngbs that can no longer be considered such at points of enhanced symmetry in the underlying theory .    using the equations of motion for the vector superfields",
    "we can actually be a little more specific .",
    "they are easily rearranged to read [ eq : hlvsolns2 ] v_== upon substitution of eq .  .",
    "expanding to leading order in the ngb superfields gives v_(+^)+^where we use the fact that @xmath86 is simply the identity element of the @xmath46 projected subspace and the implied sum in @xmath36 is understood .",
    "hence @xmath58 can indeed be related to the @xmath46 projection of the ngb superfields : precisely those whose scalar components are no longer ngbs when @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we can make a stronger claim for the vector superfields concerning the kinetic terms .",
    "returning to eq .",
    "we can rewrite the gauge coupling in the khler potential as k_a_v_^2 by factoring out the @xmath87 part of @xmath50 . as the dynamical degree of freedom @xmath87 appears to mix with the trace of the vector superfield , it is plausible that the vector superfield becomes dynamical via a mixing with this quasi - ngb .",
    "we will see more examples of the equivalence between vector superfields and quasi - ngbs later on .",
    "many of the abstract ideas of the previous section can be crystallised by considering the example of sqcd . indeed",
    ", we will provide further arguments that the magnetic dual can be interpreted as the hls description as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . to do",
    "so we will first derive the appropriate sigma model description , then go onto show that it is gauge equivalent to the usual magnetic theory .",
    "we take an electric theory with @xmath13 colours and @xmath14 flavours .",
    "the anomaly free flavour symmetry is g = su(n+n)_lsu(n+n)_ru(1)_bu(1)_r under which electric quarks @xmath88 and @xmath89 transform as per table [ tab : hqel ] . gauge invariant meson and baryon operators @xmath90 parameterise the theory s moduli space . at a generic point",

    "indeed , the corresponding ` gauge ' transformations map @xmath200 , thereby moving one around the moduli space . for appropriate supermultiplets ( perhaps those of @xmath201 susy )",

    "we will not explore this direction here .",
    "either way , integrating out the massive degrees of freedom leaves an sqcd - like theory with @xmath15 colours and @xmath15 flavours .",

    "we thus see that the superpotential drives confinement in the hls description , and is therefore responsible for breaking the gauge symmetry .",
    "so in addition to ensuring that the hls description ultimately has the correct degrees of freedom , the superpotential also allows for a uv completion in which the gauge symmetry breaking is not simply encoded in the field definitions . from the hls point of view",
    "this confinement is inevitable because , once the magnetic quark degrees of freedom are made massive ( as they must be in order to avoid double counting ) , it is the only way to reproduce the @xmath204 symmetry breaking of the original nonlinear sigma model .",
    "sqcd provides a perfect illustration of the discussion of symmetry restoration in section [ sec : rgs ] . to restore the gauge symmetry",
    "one takes the limit @xmath205 holding @xmath206 and @xmath207 fixed .",
    "it is the @xmath130 symmetry and its associated quasi - ngb @xmath208 that enables magnetic quarks to be scaled in this way .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , given that we know @xmath1-charges are generally related to scaling dimensions in superconformal field theories .",
    "the decay constants , hls gauge field masses and meson expectation all vanish in this limit , with the magnetic quark masses following suit .",
    "the gauge symmetry is therefore restored ( as is the full flavour symmetry ) and all additional terms vanish from eq .  , leaving @xmath148 sqcd+m with massless quarks and a canonical quark khler potential .    to recast the meaning of the limit in the language of seiberg duality , recall that all order parameters arise from quasi - ngb expectations in the electric theory . by choosing non - zero values for @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    "we therefore define the duality at a particular point in moduli space , where the flavour symmetry is maximally broken .",
    "travelling away from this point in the magnetic theory , along the quasi - ngb direction that breaks @xmath130 , all fields ( and consequently order parameters ) are scaled to zero .",
    "duality implies that one should simultaneously move to the same point in the electric theory s moduli space , hence all order parameters vanish there as well . in the full theory",
    "this would , of course , restore the corresponding electric gauge symmetry .",
    "note that the process is insensitive to the initial values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 so they remain independent parameters .    before taking the @xmath205",
    "limit the expectations of @xmath88 and @xmath89 saturated their ranks , forbidding expectations for the components of the electric quarks @xmath194 and @xmath209 ( which instead contain ngbs of the symmetry breaking ) . as the quark expectations start to vanish the constraint is relaxed and new flat directions open up ; precisely those parameterised by the @xmath2-mesons constructed from @xmath194 and @xmath209 . at the same time",
    "the hls gauge fields become massless .",
    "already we are starting to see hints that the magnetic gauge fields can be identified with electric @xmath2-mesons .",
    "note also that the magnetic quarks become massless as the meson expectation vanishes .",
    "initially , one may think this leads to double counted degrees of freedom in the hls description .",
    "however , the electric gauge fields become massless in this limit as well ( besides which , the sigma model description breaks down so its degrees of freedom are ill defined ) . indeed ,",
    "if we are to identify magnetic gauge fields with electric @xmath2-mesons , duality suggests we should also identify electric gauge fields with magnetic @xmath2-mesons .",
    "thus the newly massless magnetic quarks represent electric gauge fields rather than double counted degrees of freedom .",
    "another interesting limit to consider is the baryonic branch of the theory . here",
    ", one has a vanishing expectation for @xmath89 but q=    v & 0    i.e.  only the baryon direction of moduli space has non - zero expectation .",
    "the unbroken flavour symmetry is then h = su(n)_lsu(n)_lsu(n+n)_ru(1)_b^u(1)_r^. hence all breaking is confined to the @xmath106 factor .",
    "following the standard procedure one does not expect magnetic antiquarks @xmath85 to appear in the hls description at all .",
    "the same is true for the meson superfield , for which only the components arising from @xmath210 are present .",
    "specifically , one would write down [ eq : hqkq ] k= in place of eq .  .",
    "the rest of the reasoning of section [ sec : rm ] remains unchanged and yields a theory with [ eq : hqkq2 ] k=+v^2 and no superpotential .",
    "however , this theory clearly fails to capture all of the low energy physics as there are no degrees of freedom corresponding to the massless chiral superfields @xmath89 .",
    "this is because no scalar components of @xmath89 are ngbs on the baryonic branch so are not represented in a description based on ngb superfields .",
    "suppose we include the magnetic antiquarks , meson superfield and @xmath151 anyway , and continue to use the khler potential with superpotential .",
    "expanding around the vacuum using eq .",
    "for the expectation of @xmath83 , the superpotential becomes w = b^1/n(+y)+  ,where =    &    , and m=    x & + z & y    .",
    "hence all components of @xmath85 are massive . upon integrating them out the khler potential reduces back to eq .   and the superpotential vanishes .",
    "one can therefore include the magnetic antiquarks even though they are not explicitly generated by ngb superfields .",
    "once again the superpotential has proven itself instrumental in removing superfluous degrees of freedom from the hls description .",
    "furthermore , the meson is now expanded to leading order as m = q = v    & 0 + & 0    .",
    "its massless components @xmath211 and @xmath212 are directly related to @xmath89 ; degrees of freedom that would otherwise be missing .",
    "rather than arising from the flipped coset hls description , the meson is now an extra matter superfield added by hand ( or indeed just left alone for the whole procedure ) .",
    "meanwhile the superpotential ensures that the components @xmath213 and @xmath214 , that correspond to degrees of freedom already accounted for in the quark sector , are massive and so removed from the low energy theory .",
    "we therefore conclude that the hls description derived in section [ sec : rm ] also describes the baryonic branch of the theory , even though the symmetry breaking pattern is different there .",
    "while the branch with @xmath215 is the only one discussed in this section , it is clear that the same reasoning applies to @xmath216 .      in this section",
    "we have argued that the magnetic gauge group of seiberg duality arises as an hls , corresponding to the diagonal subgroup of the @xmath155 flavour symmetry preserved at a generic point in moduli space .",

    "equivalently , the combination of meson and superpotential can be thought of a source for @xmath199 due to the fact that there is a non - zero meson background , or as a facilitator for a consistent uv completion of the hls description .",
    "the hls formalism only defines the duality at points in moduli space where both electric and magnetic gauge groups are completely broken .",
    "however , the presence of a spontaneously broken @xmath1-symmetry allows a limit to be taken in which both are restored .",

    "the rank condition in the electric theory still holds : we can only assign a rank @xmath13 expectation to the combined @xmath387 and @xmath388 system , and the flavour group is broken to @xmath389 .    note that there are @xmath390 degrees of freedom available for the dressed quarks , and we require @xmath391 degrees of freedom for the p and m - type superfields .",
    "hence we require @xmath392 which we can write as [ banana ] n_f+n>(2k-1)n_f .",
    "the free magnetic window of adjoint sqcd is @xmath393 , with @xmath394 signalling @xmath395-confinement .",
    "since by assumption @xmath396 , the condition in eq .",
    "defining when we are able to use the hls formalism also seems to define the upper edge of the free magnetic window .",
    "the hls description now closely follows the discussion in section 3 , but with the flavour symmetries enhanced to @xmath397 factors , and with the hls being assigned to the anomaly free diagonal @xmath398 group . in the standard coset description ,",
    "@xmath135 and @xmath136 are @xmath399 matrices , with the latter index being identified with magnetic colour .",
    "the full @xmath50 transforms as @xmath400 and similar for @xmath146 , where @xmath122 are flavour rotations in @xmath397 , giving precisely the degrees of freedom of the dressed magnetic quarks .",
    "the flipped coset description producing the mesons goes over all @xmath397 indices and hence reproduces all @xmath401 mesons .",
    "the discussion extends quite directly to the more complicated @xmath0 duals discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite  for example the sqcd model presented there with two adjoints has @xmath402 flavours of dressed quarks , and the magnetic gauge group is accordingly @xmath403 .",
    "our main aim in this work has been to place seiberg duality on a more dynamical footing . in this way",
    "we hope ultimately to use the duality to learn more about dynamical processes in strongly coupled theories , rather than just the properties of the lagrangians and vacua .",
    "this section briefly summarises some of the applications we have in mind .",
    "detailed investigations are left for future work .",
    "an obvious application is composite gauge field scattering , as illustrated in figure [ fig : chrgm ] .",
    "an electric theory where @xmath15 flavours have equal mass @xmath288 is taken to be the ` true ' theory , but it confines in the ir meaning that the low energy physics is obscured . fortunately , seiberg duality steps in and provides an alternative , perturbative description in the shape of a higgsed magnetic theory .",
    "the magnetic gauge group is an emergent symmetry , with the massive gauge fields originating purely from composite operators .",
    "if this were true , one would expect to see effects from the underlying electric theory near to the confinement scale",
    ". in particular , signs of compositeness should start to appear in magnetic gauge field scattering amplitudes . using the hls interpretation",
    "we can start to quantify such phenomena . as discussed in sections",
    "[ sec : rho ] and [ sec : mu ] , magnetic gauge fields are explicitly related to electric @xmath2-mesons via v_mg^ where = _",
    "el()^n/2n is the higgsing scale of the magnetic theory , and also the confinement scale of the electric theory .",
    "schematically , one expects elastic scattering amplitudes for the longitudinal components of magnetic gauge bosons to grow with the centre of mass energy squared @xmath395 .",
    "this divergence is the standard unitarity violation problem .",
    "it is addressed in the current framework at the higgsing scale of the magnetic theory , whereupon higgs boson exchange unitarises the scattering .",
    "the associated higgs field is itself a composite object so , in effect , we have a composite higgs model .",
    "however , the higgsing description is short lived and the composite nature of the gauge bosons immediately becomes apparent .",
    "their amplitudes are instead mapped onto the equivalent @xmath2-meson scattering amplitudes in the electric theory . in the perturbative regime",
    "the leading order contribution of figure [ fig : parhos ] dominates , scaling as @xmath404 for running electric gauge coupling @xmath405 .",
    "asymptotic freedom ensures that these amplitudes remain under control as the centre of mass energy is increased further .",
    "the overall situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : pacs ] .",
    "approaching from below the higgsing scale we anticipate the appearance of a resonance in @xmath406 scattering , corresponding to the magnetic higgs boson .",
    "approaching from above we expect the @xmath407 amplitude to diverge as the electric theory becomes strongly coupled .",
    "interpolating between the two therefore suggests a top heavy , broadened ` resonance ' around the higgsing / confinement scale @xmath262 .    ) for the longitudinal components of magnetic gauge bosons . below the higgsing scale",
    "the amplitude grows with @xmath395 before hitting a higgs resonance at @xmath262 . above the higgsing scale it matches onto the amplitude for elastic @xmath2-meson scattering in the electric theory , which goes like @xmath404 in the perturbative regime .",
    "the dashed line crudely interpolates between the two perturbative regimes , tracing out a top heavy , broadened ` resonance'.[fig : pacs],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    this could , for example , be the case in the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "all we really know is that low energy physics is well described by a broken @xmath408 gauge theory",
    ". we do not know that this is ever an actual symmetry of nature .",
    "it could merely emerge as an effective description of some other , strongly coupled theory .",
    "one can also consider weakly gauging the original diagonal @xmath148 flavour factor . in this case",
    "we denote the full gauge group as @xmath409 .",
    "@xmath410 is the usual , composite , magnetic colour factor and @xmath411 is the elementary factor from the gauged flavour symmetry .",
    "the only difference in the resulting hls description is that the surviving diagonal subgroup su(n)_csu(n)_esu(n ) is now a gauge symmetry , which comes with _ partially _ composite gauge fields .",
    "taking gauge couplings @xmath412 and @xmath413 for each factor , the tree level mass eigenstates are @xmath414 with mass squared @xmath415 and zero respectively .",
    "the running gauge couplings are evaluated at the higgsing scale @xmath262 so the composition of the mass eigenstates can vary . in the free magnetic phase , @xmath412 increases and the heavy state becomes more composite for larger values of @xmath262 .",
    "when @xmath416 , the coupling @xmath412 hits its landau pole and the heavy state is fully composite .",
    "models with partially composite gauge fields arising from seiberg duality have recently been studied in the context of the electroweak sector of the mssm @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that they have several phenomenological advantages , including an increased higgs mass and a `` natural '' superpartner spectrum with light stops . in these models",
    "the symmetry breaking typically occurs in two phases , corresponding to two different electric quark masses @xmath417 . at the higher scale @xmath418 the @xmath419 gauge symmetry",
    "is broken to its diagonal subgroup , which is identified with the @xmath420 of the mssm . at @xmath421",
    "this is further broken by the usual ( composite ) higgs fields .    for @xmath422 the two processes",
    "are well separated and the final @xmath420 breaking looks like a vanilla higgs mechanism ( albeit with a potential different from that usually found in the mssm ) . for @xmath423",
    "this separation does not exist and the underlying strong coupling has a large effect .",
    "the final @xmath148 breaking starts to look more like that of a technicolour model , being driven by confinement in the electric theory . between these two regimes",
    "one has a composite higgs model , with the compositeness becoming more noticeable as the ratio @xmath424 is increased .",
    "hence this framework can be used to continuously interpolate between higgsing and technicolour descriptions of ( supersymmetric ) electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the hls interpretation allows a concrete uv completion ( i.e.  electric theory ) to be defined for these models .",
    "it also allows for the exploration of phenomenology away from the far ir or uv , such as the gauge boson scattering amplitudes discussed above .",
    "much of the original work on hidden local symmetries was motivated by trying to understand the chiral lagrangian of low energy qcd . indeed ,",
    "this was also the primary phenomenological focus of refs .  @xcite .",
    "consequently , our discussion would not really be complete without some brief comments on lessons that might be learned in this area .",
    "real world qcd is not supersymmetric so there is a limit to how trustworthy any insights derived from seiberg duality can be . in particular , many of our conclusions rely on the existence of quasi - ngbs that simply do not exist in the absence of susy .",
    "one could , for example , attempt to construct a chiral lagrangian accounting for heavy quarks by writing down an electric theory with @xmath425 .",
    "three flavours ( top , bottom and charm ) have masses way above the electric ( i.e.  qcd ) scale so are integrated out . the electric theory",
    "subsequently confines at a scale @xmath426 .    since @xmath427 for this theory the magnetic description has the same gauge group .",
    "in addition , section [ sec : mu ] suggests @xmath428 for such theories .",
    "the gauge group is higgsed to @xmath420 at a scale @xmath429 , which is further higgsed to nothing at a scale @xmath430 .",
    "we therefore have magnetic gauge fields with masses @xmath431 for running gauge coupling @xmath432 , evaluated at each of the two higgsing scales . a qcd scale of @xmath433 mev would give @xmath434 gev and @xmath435 gev : too small to correspond to any of the vector mesons in the heavy quark sector of qcd .",
    "however , this is to be expected .",
    "the magnetic gauge fields arise from quasi - ngbs in sqcd , which have no right to remain massless without susy . it is therefore unsurprising that they end up with much larger masses in qcd , where susy is taken away .",
    "an aspect of the above discussion _ not _ strongly affected by susy is the argument used to fix the value of @xmath3 in section [ sec : rho ] .",
    "the general strategy was to derive two separate expressions for the magnetic gauge fields : one from the equations of motion turned out by the hls formalism , and one from the noether currents for the unbroken flavour symmetry . by comparing them",
    "we were able to fix the normalisation of the magnetic quarks and , consequently , the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the same idea ought to work for real world qcd . in sqcd",
    "we knew exactly what the electric and magnetic quark expectations were , and could easily write down explicit expressions for the ngbs . in qcd",
    "the moduli space is less well understood , with fermion , rather than scalar , expectations providing the order parameters for the symmetry breaking .",
    "hence a direct translation of our results is not possible .",
    "nonetheless , the hls formalism has been applied to massless , two flavour qcd @xcite where the quark condensate is assumed to break the chiral @xmath436 flavour symmetry to its diagonal subgroup .",
    "the formalism results in hls gauge field equations of motion that set v^_=-^^_^for pions @xmath437 .",
    "one can also write down the current for the unbroken flavour symmetry in the hls description . in the unitary gauge it is @xcite generators",
    "are chosen to satisfy @xmath438}=2\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] . ]",
    "[ eq : apj ] j^_=2av^2v^_+2v^2(a-2)^^_^+    if we then consider a pure gauge field state the current is given by @xmath439 .",
    "substituting in the gauge field equations of motion simplifies the expression to @xmath440 . on the other hand",
    ", one can calculate the current directly from the sigma model description to find @xmath441 .",
    "consistency thus requires @xmath4 .",
    "of course , there remains the question of how a pure gauge field state can exist when the equations of motion fix @xmath442 . in a sense",
    "it can not .",
    "but as far as the physical currents are concerned it can , provided @xmath4 such that the pion contribution disappears .",
    "so @xmath4 can be considered a direct consequence of allowing ` pure ' gauge field states ( i.e.  @xmath2-mesons ) to exist in the hls description of qcd .",
    "this discussion brings us finally to non - supersymmetric dualities which , of course , it would be very interesting to establish . in the past",
    "there have been various attempts in this direction .",
    "none of them are quite as compelling as seiberg duality itself , mainly because non - supersymmetric theories do not usually have interesting moduli spaces .",
    "other matching tests such as t  hooft anomaly matching are significantly weaker , often not uniquely pinning down the dual description . moreover the most constraining anomalies involve the @xmath1-symmetry , which is not available in non - supersymmetric theories .",
    "we have seen that the notion of an hls provides a somewhat more mechanical route to dualities . to establish a pair of seiberg duals one begins with the electric theory of interest .",
    "its higgsing leads to a nonlinear sigma model that can in turn be expressed as a linearised hls theory .",
    "the existence of @xmath1-symmetry then guarantees a modulus along which the gauge symmetries in both descriptions are smoothly restored .",
    "this procedure does not rely on the usual tests of moduli space or anomaly matching .    in principle at least , it is clear what would be required in order to establish such a duality without susy .",
    "first one requires an electric theory that can be higgsed or confined to give a nonlinear sigma model .",
    "this is linearised in the hls formalism , and the identification of magnetic degrees of freedom made in the same manner as for the susy theories . in order to be able to take a symmetry restoring limit one",
    "would then need a scaling symmetry to be present .",
    "thus the theories of interest would most likely be of the kind discussed in @xcite , in which scale invariance is spontaneously broken by a `` dilaton '' playing much the same role as the conformal compensator ( equivalently @xmath129 ) in the susy case .",
    "having established a candidate duality in this way one could , of course , still apply all the usual tests .",
    "any duality constructed via the hls formalism that passed them all would surely be on firm footing indeed .",
