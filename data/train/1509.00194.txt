    "the study of the properties of hadrons under extreme conditions is one of the main research activities of several experimental programs and , in particular , of the forthcoming fair ( germany ) project .",
    "the aim is to move from the light - quark sector to the heavy - quark domain and to face new challenges where charm and new symmetries , such as heavy - quark symmetries , will play a significant role .",
    "one of the primary goals is to understand the nature of newly discovered states and , in particular , baryonic states with charm and bottom degrees of freedom . in that respect , approaches based on unitarized coupled - channel dynamics",
    "have shown a tremendous success in the past .",
    "recently , a unitarized coupled - channel scheme that incorporates heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) @xcite constraints has been developed @xcite .",
    "hqss is a proper symmetry of the strong interaction that appears when the quark masses become larger than the typical confinement scale .",
    "furthermore , nuclear medium corrections have been implemented @xcite to study the properties of the newly discovered heavy baryonic states in dense matter and their influence on heavy mesons in nuclear matter and nuclei .    in this work",
    "we study the properties of heavy hadrons in dense matter .",
    "we aim at investigating nuclear medium effects on dynamically - generated heavy baryonic resonances and the consequences for the formation of charmed mesic nuclei as well as the propagation of heavy mesons under extreme conditions .",
    "heavy baryonic states are dynamically generated by the scattering of mesons and baryons within a unitarized coupled - channel approach . in this work we employ a model that explicitly incorporates hqss  @xcite .",
    "hqss predicts that all types of spin interactions involving heavy quarks vanish for infinitely massive quarks , thus , connecting vector and pseudoscalar mesons containing heavy quarks .",
    "furthermore , chiral symmetry fixes the lowest order interaction between goldstone bosons and other hadrons by means of the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term .",
    "this predictive model includes all basic hadrons ( pseudoscalar and vector mesons , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons ) and it reduces to the wt interaction in the sector where goldstone bosons are involved while incorporating hqss in the sector where heavy quarks participate .",
    "this scheme is justified in view of the reasonable outcome of the su(6 ) extension in the three - flavor sector @xcite and on a formal plausibleness in the vector - meson exchange picture of the interaction in the heavy pseudoscalar meson - baryon sector .",
    "the extended wt model with hqss constraints is used as the kernel of the on - shell bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels so as to calculate the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the poles of the scattering amplitudes are the dynamically - generated heavy baryonic resonances . in this work we present results in the sector with heavy ( charm / bottom ) ( h ) , strange ( s ) and isospin ( i ) content such as @xmath3 , where the @xmath0 states are found @xcite .",
    "we study the generalized weinberg s sum rule @xcite to estimate the importance of the different meson - baryon channels for the generation of the @xmath0 states . in table",
    "[ fig : reso ] we show the spin - parity ( @xmath4 ) , mass ( @xmath5 ) and width ( @xmath6 ) of the different charmed and bottomed @xmath0 states , together with the absolute value of the coupling to the dominant meson - baryon channels ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 represents the _ compositeness _ of the hadronic state in terms of all the considered channels , and @xmath9 is referred to as its _",
    "elementariness_. a small value of @xmath9 indicates that the state is well described by the contributions explicitly considered , namely , @xmath10-wave meson - baryon channels , while a larger value of @xmath9 indicates that , for that state , significant pieces of information are missing in the model .",
    "we obtain two @xmath11 and one @xmath12 @xmath0 states .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 states which are bound states ( the three @xmath13 ) or narrow resonances ( one @xmath14 ) are well described as molecular states composed of @xmath10-wave meson - baryon pairs .",
    "the @xmath15 wide @xmath14 as well as the @xmath16 @xmath17 states display smaller compositeness . with respect to the detailed composition of the states , we find that the first @xmath18 states of each flavor couple strongly to pseudoscalar-@xmath19 and vector-@xmath19 channels . for the second @xmath18 states ,",
    "the main observation is its sizable coupling to the lightest channels @xmath20 .",
    "another observation is the similar structure of the second @xmath18 and @xmath21 states , which appear as hqss or spin - flavor partners .",
    "the in - medium modifications of the dynamically - generated @xmath0 states ( and others ) have important consequences on the properties of heavy mesons in matter . in particular , the properties of open - charm mesons in matter have been object of recent analysis due to the consequences for charmonium suppression . moreover , the existence of charmed meson bound states in nuclei have been predicted in @xmath22pb @xcite , using an attractive @xmath23 and @xmath24 -meson potential in the nuclear medium within a quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model .",
    "the experimental observation of these bound states , though , can be problematic since their widths could be very large compared to the separation of the levels .    within our model , we obtain that the @xmath25-nucleus states are weakly bound ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : medio ] ) , in contrast to previous results using the qmc model .",
    "moreover , those states have significant widths @xcite , in particular , for @xmath22pb .",
    "only @xmath25-nucleus bound states are possible since the coulomb interaction forbids the formation of bound states for @xmath26 mesons . as for @xmath24 mesons in nuclei , not only @xmath27 but",
    "also @xmath28 bind in nuclei @xcite .",
    "the information on bound states is very valuable for gaining insight into the meson - nucleus interaction at the panda experiment at fair . nevertheless , the experimental observation of @xmath23 and @xmath24-meson bound states is a difficult task .",
    "open - charm mesons with high momenta would be produced in antiproton - nucleus collisions at panda and it is a challenge to bind them in nuclei @xcite .",
    "information on the properties of heavy mesons in matter can be also achieved by analyzing the heavy - meson propagation in the hot and dense medium created in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the heavy - meson propagation can be studied by means of solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation .",
    "the two relevant quantities to be determined are the drag ( @xmath29 ) and diffusion coefficients ( @xmath30 ) of heavy mesons in hot dense matter .",
    "these are obtained from an effective field theory that incorporates both the chiral and hqss in the meson @xcite and baryon sectors @xcite .",
    "one interesting observable is the behaviour of the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath31 that appears in fick s diffusion law in medium , given in terms of the scalar @xmath32 and @xmath33 coefficients @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusion ] we show @xmath34 for @xmath23 and @xmath35 mesons following isentropic trajectories ( @xmath36=ct ) from rhic to fair energies . for the @xmath23 mesons ,",
    "we observe that the dependence of the @xmath34 on the entropy per baryon is similar in the hadronic and quark phase ( below and above the transition temperature of @xmath37 , respectively ) .",
    "the possible matching between curves in both phases for a given @xmath36 seems to indicate the possible existence of a minimum in the @xmath34 at the phase transition @xcite .     for @xmath23 meson ( left plot ) and @xmath35 meson ( right plot ) ( taken from ref .",
