    "in high magnetic field @xmath3 two parallel layers of two - dimensional electrons in close proximity have been shown to exhibit many - body states with distinct quantum properties that arise from the degree of freedom that identifies the layer .",
    "explicit interlayer correlations are present in the fractional quantum hall state at total landau level filling @xmath4 @xcite as well as the celebrated bilayer excitonic condensate state at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 excitonic condensate state is seen for small layer separation and an interlayer sufficiently large that interlayer tunneling is negligible . in the well - known language in which layer index is taken as pseudospin",
    ", the state is an easy - plane ferromagnet , and has carrier wave functions coherently distributed between the two layers .",
    "imbalance @xcite , or unequal density for the two layers has been shown @xcite to strengthen the excitonic condensate state for moderate imbalance .",
    "bilayers , like single layer 2d carrier systems , become insulating at low enough @xmath6 , and in bilayers as in single layers@xcite , the low @xmath6 insulators are understood as pinned wigner solids @xcite .",
    "several different bilayer wigner crystal ( bwc ) states have been predicted theoretically @xcite for the balanced condition , in which the carrier densities of the two layers are equal , and without interlayer tunneling ( the relevant case for samples considered in this paper ) .",
    "these phases depend on the relative strength of interlayer and intralayer carrier - carrier interactions , as determined by @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the interlayer separation , and @xmath7 is the mean in - plane carrier spacing for total density @xmath8 . for the smallest @xmath2 , a one - component phase is predicted , which at each site of a triangular lattice has a carrier coherently present in both layers .",
    "the one - component lattice is an easy - plane pseudospin ferromagnetic bwc ( fmbwc ) . at larger @xmath2 , without interlayer tunneling ,",
    "the phases are two - component , with each layer having a lattice .",
    "the lattices are staggered with respect to each other , so the state is a pseudospin antiferromagnetic bwc ( afmbwc ) . among these two - component staggered phases ,",
    "a square lattice was predicted to cover a wide range of @xmath2 @xcite , though other phases , with rectangular or rhombic lattices , were also predicted @xcite . for large @xmath2 ,",
    "the intralayer interaction dominates , and each layer has a triangular lattice like that of a single layer wigner crystal .    in both single layer @xcite and bilayer @xcite systems , the spectra of the pinned low @xmath6 solid exhibit striking resonances that are understood as pinning modes , in which pieces of the solid oscillate within the potential of the residual disorder .",
    "useful information on the pinned solid is provided by the resonance : its frequency characterizes the strength of the pinning , and its integrated amplitude indicates the number of participating carriers .",
    "this paper expands on our earlier work @xcite , which exploited the pinning mode to characterize low @xmath6 bwc phases in samples at balance ( with equal layer densities ) , using a series of p - type samples with essentially zero tunneling between layers , and different layer separations . as in the earlier paper",
    ", we use the parameter @xmath9 to characterize effective separation .",
    "the factor of @xmath10 is included in  for comparison with the results @xcite on the @xmath5 excitonic bose condensate , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic length at total landau filling @xmath5 for a balanced state .",
    "our earlier paper@xcite described the change in the pinning mode on changing the top and bottom layer densities , from a balanced state @xmath13 to a one - layer state @xmath14 , in order to capture the effects of interlayer interaction and correlation on the balanced state .",
    "we found , for low interlayer separation , @xmath15 , that the pinning mode resonance peak frequency ,  was enhanced above the value expected @xcite from the overall density , which determines the stiffness of the solid .",
    "we interpreted the results as consistent with these low  samples being in an fmbwc phase at balance .",
    "the interpretation is based on theory @xcite which explains an enhancement of   specific to the fmbwc , in the presence of disorder that is correlated in the two layers .",
    "in this paper we study the same series of samples with various , varying the layer densities to look at unbalanced states .",
    "we find that on small imbalance , the resonance does not split for samples with @xmath15 .",
    "for larger , the resonance does split into two peaks , one of which is mainly sensitive to the top layer density , the other to the bottom layer density .",
    "moreover , the  enhancement observed earlier in the @xmath15 at balance persists out to significant imbalance .",
    "we interpret these observations in the framework of fmbwc for low  samples , and afmbwc for higher  samples .",

    "for bottom layer density @xmath18 , the bwc has a single pinning mode .",

    "our microwave measuring setup has been described in earlier publications @xcite .",
    "shows a schematic of a bilayer sample and the measuring circuit . a metal film transmission line on the top surface of the sample couples capacitively with the bilayer .",
    "the transmission line is of the coplanar waveguide type , with narrow , driven center conductor , separated from broad grounded side planes by slots of width @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is small enough , and the operating frequency , @xmath28 , is high enough , that the response of the bilayer has small effect on the microwave electric field , so that this field is essentially the same in both layers . in this high - frequency , low - loss case ,",
    "the in - plane microwave electric field is well - confined to the region of bilayer immediately under the slots , and we calculate re@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the transmitted power , @xmath31 is the transmitted power for a reference state in which bilayer conductivity is zero , @xmath32 is the characteristic impedance calculated from the transmission line geometry for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the length of the line . the data were obtained in the limit of low applied power ; we verified that reducing power further did not affect the measured re@xmath35 .",
    "the samples have ohmic contacts on the edges , which connect the two layers together and allow gate biasing of the bilayer .",
    "the microwave measurement precludes a conventional front gate for independent control of top and bottom layer densities ; such a gate in the slots of the coplanar waveguide would effectively short circuit the transmission line . hence , unlike in bilayer dc transport studies such as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we control the layer densities only by back gate bias relative to the bilayer .",
    "one consequence of this is that the only accessible balanced state is @xmath13 , and it is for this state that  is calculated .",
    "determination of the top and bottom layer densities @xmath36 and @xmath37 is based on the position and behavior of iqhe minima in re@xmath35 vs @xmath38 curves taken at 200 mhz . for the smaller @xmath0 samples ( m440 , m465 , and m417 ) , the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) , including the @xmath5 qhe ,",
    "is observed for several integer total filling factors @xmath6 , allowing the total density @xmath8 vs @xmath39 to be obtained .",

    "both 2d layers are neglected when fully depleted but are considered as ideal conductors ( large density of states ) otherwise .",
    "the model has two cases : 1 ) @xmath43 , @xmath44 while @xmath36 is constant and equal to its as - cooled , unbiased value , @xmath16 , and 2 ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for the larger @xmath0 samples ( m433 , m436 , m443 , and m453 ) , the top and bottom layer densities can be derived from the positions of the iqhe minima associated with individual layers , but only for @xmath39 ranges in which such minima are resolved . for @xmath47 outside of these ranges ,",
    "the densities are estimated by extrapolation , also based on the capacitive model .",
    "the capacitive model neglects kinetic energy and carrier interaction in the layers . for a hole bilayer with a backgate , when @xmath37 is nearly depleted",
    ", this can cause @xmath36 to increase slightly with increasing @xmath39 ( or decreasing @xmath8 ) , while @xmath37 decreases faster than linearly .",
    "this deviation from the capacitive model , referred to as carrier transfer , was studied @xmath48 @xcite , and considered in the high @xmath38 insulating regime @xcite .",
    "carrier transfer does not affect the relationship of @xmath8 and @xmath39 , and does not affect the identification of the balanced state @xmath13 .",
    "following calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , using a classical estimate of a single - layer wigner crystal cohesive energy , and neglecting the kinetic energy since both layers are considered in the lowest landau level , we find the capacitive model can underestimate the the @xmath8 at which the the bottom layer is completely depleted by as much as @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "for the most widely separated samples , m453 and m443 , we find two resolved pinning modes whenever there is significant @xmath37 , as long as the layer densities are not too close to balance .",

    "the peaks appear as the filling factor of the respective layer goes below about 0.3 , consistent with an earlier study @xcite of pinning mode development in single - layer p - type samples . in the rest of this paper",
    "we are concerned only with this low @xmath6 solid regime , in which the pinning modes are well developed .",
    "b shows spectra of m453 at @xmath54 t in bilayer states with fixed @xmath36 and varying @xmath37 , as required by the experimental constraints discussed in the previous section .",

    "the b resonance vanishes as @xmath37 approaches zero , and the two resonances overlap for the balanced state .",

    "resonance t dominates and resonance b shows as a high @xmath28 shoulder . summarizes the data for m453 and m443 , which have well - resolved pinning modes for all significant @xmath37 , as long as the bilayer is away from balance .",
    "the dependence of the t resonance peak frequency , @xmath60 , of m443 is most easily seen in the inset to b. the evidence for coupling of the pinning modes is in the gradual decrease of @xmath60 as @xmath37 is decreased over most of its range . we ascribe the sharp rise of @xmath60 near @xmath61 on the plot to change in the top - layer density .",

    "the interpretation of the data is in terms of two competing effects .",
    "the first effect is generic to pinning modes , including those in single layers , and is an increase of  as the spacing of the interacting carriers increases",
    ". we will refer to it as the  carrier density effect \" , since with larger carrier - carrier spacing ( smaller density ) hence decreased carrier - carrier interaction , the carriers must associate more closely with the minima in the disorder potential , causing average pinning energy and average restoring force per carrier , and , to increase .",
    "this behavior has been established theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in single layers . at fixed @xmath38 within the low @xmath6 carrier solid range ,",
    "the experiments show @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the single layer carrier density , and @xmath100 at low densities , but @xmath101 at higher density .",
    "the @xmath102 power law is seen in  vs @xmath8 in regions ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) in , and within region ( 3 ) as well . in region ( 1 ) , as shown in a , @xmath55 vs. @xmath8 roughly follows the power law extrapolated from region ( 0 ) .",
    "this behavior is explainable as due to the carrier - carrier interaction effect only and indicates that the pinning does not change dramatically from the single layer condition of region 0 .",
    "this suggests that the carriers do not spread between the two layers , hence the pseudospin does not have an in - plane component .",
    "the second effect is particular to bwcs , and is an enhancement of the pinning in fmbwc relative to other bwc pseudospin orders .",
    "one of us @xcite suggested that when there are positional correlations between the effective disorders in the top and bottom layers there is an enhancement of  by a factor of @xmath103 relative to the case of an afmbwc in the low - separation limit .",
    "one possible natural source of such correlated disorder would be impurities which enable local interlayer tunneling .",
    "the amount of enhancement relative to the extrapolated carrier - density effect line was considered at balance in ref . .",
    "balanced states @xmath13 were compared to states @xmath14 with nearly the same density in the top layer , but with the bottom layer depleted .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 of the pinning mode frequencies of these states is denoted by @xmath97 , which measures the change of pinning on `` adding '' the bottom layer .",
    "that reference presented a curve of @xmath97 vs , which is reproduced here as c. the curve showed a sharp minimum for @xmath105 .",
    "the theory @xcite of the fmbwc for disorder - free , balanced bilayers predicts fmbwc for  below about @xmath106 , considerably below the  at which we see enhancement of pinning experimentally .",
    "one possible explanation of this discrepancy is that the fmbwc is being stabilized over competing bwc phases by its enhanced pinning .    within region ( 3 ) , for example in a",
    ", @xmath55 decreases on increasing @xmath8 , consistent with the carrier density effect .",
    "overall though , @xmath55 vs. @xmath8 in region ( 3 ) is markedly enhanced above the curve extrapolated from the single layer region ( 0 ) .",
    "the upward displacement shows the pinning is enhanced relative to the pinning of single layer wigner solid seen in region ( 0 ) and possibly region ( 1 ) , after these are corrected for the carrier density effect .",
    "the enhanced pinning persists , under an imbalance @xmath107 as large as @xmath108 .",
    "the 8 and 14 t data in both show the enhancement , with the 8 t enhancement slightly larger around the balanced state .",
    "this remains consistent with both fields being sufficient to produce well developed bwc solids ; the differences between the 8 and 14 t curves may involve the dependence of effective disorder  which incorporates the in - plane extent of a carrier wave function  on the magnetic length@xcite .",
    "the  pushed up \" region ( 3 ) is observed only for states on the low  side of the minimum in c. we interpret the  enhancement in this region as due to fmbwc formation , as was presented for the balanced case in ref . , but also extending into imbalanced states .",
    "this is possible since even within an fmbwc , the carrier wave function may not spread equally in the two layers . in pseudospin language , this would also mean that at least some pseudospins have an in - plane component , and the orientation of the pseudospins changes with density imbalance . within region ( 3 ) , @xmath55 shows no sharp feature at balance , but @xmath65 does exhibit a minimum just at balance .",
    "this suggests an imbalance - induced effect , which increases damping of the resonance without affecting pinning .",
    "based on the classification of bwc at balance , this damping is present only when the bwc at balance is an easy - plane ferromagnet .",
    "the damping may result from excess carriers of the majority layer , which we speculate may act as defects , or could themselves form a condensed phase@xcite .",
    "region ( 2 ) can be interpreted as a transition between between region ( 1 ) with pinning of individual layers ( smaller @xmath55 ) and region ( 3 ) with enhanced pinning ( larger @xmath55 ) .",
    "the local @xmath65 maximum , which is observed in the middle of region ( 2 ) , could then be interpreted as due to a transition between different bwc phases . at the transition region ,",
    "multiple bwc phases can in principle coexist .",
    "the broadening effect possibly originates from dissipative excitations that are associated with the phase boundaries .",
    "this picture is strengthened by the data on m433 in b which show no local @xmath65 maximum . for m433 , which has @xmath96 ,   enhancement in region ( 3 ) is much less than that in m465 , which has lower . instead , @xmath65 for m433 decreases on increasing @xmath8 , which can be interpreted as due to the carrier density effect .",
    "an alternate explanation of the enhancement of  around balance in region ( 3 ) in a ( and the minimum in @xmath97 vs  in c ) is that there is an increase in  due to softening of the bwc .",
    "such softening might occur around a phase transition from one type of bwc to another , since near a transition many carrier arrangements have similar energies .",
    "the @xmath72 data in a are difficult to reconcile to this picture , in which region ( 3 ) rather than region ( 2 ) would be identified with a transition , since the maximum in @xmath72 occurs in region ( 2 ) , and a minimum in @xmath72 occurs in region ( 3 ) .",
    "if softening of the solid occurs at a phase transition , one would naturally expect more damping at the transition , contrary to the data .    the behavior of the samples at small imbalance ( small but sufficient to resolve the two pinning modes of the independent layer case ) is a strong indication that a balanced sample would go though a phase transition as  goes below 1.8 ( the minimum in c ) . for @xmath15",
    "there is only one resonance at small imbalance , while for @xmath109 the resonance splits .    in summary , by studying the peak frequency in the imbalanced states",
    ", we found that the enhanced pinning exists not only at balance , but also over a considerable range of imbalanced states ( around the balance ) for low-   bilayers .",
    "in addition , the small - separation samples that show the enhanced pinning do not exhibit a splitting of the pinning mode when the layer densities are subject to small imbalance .",
    "the interpretation is in terms of a pseudospin fmbwc , present at balance but persisting even for considerable imbalance .",
