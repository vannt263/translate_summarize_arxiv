    "electron - hole many body interacting systems in semiconductors display a number of unconventional effects at low temperatures .",
    "this richness ranges from unconventional forms of superconducting pairing to effects that one would expect to observe in relativistic systems , such as singularities and nontrivial topologies in the energy bands ( topological insulators and superconductors ) . in this article",
    "we will concentrate on the condensation of itinerant electron - hole bound states , i.e. the wannier - mott excitons that have been speculated a long time ago by moskalenko , blatt , keldish and kopaev@xcite and still is subject to hot debates .",
    "a number of experiments have been performed , first in the bulk systems and later in confined geometries , using two - dimensional coupled quantum wells@xcite .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation of excitons in a many body interacting environment of itinerant electrons and holes confined in separate planar quantum wells separated by a distance @xmath0 has been an effective method to understand many of the interesting new phenomena of these systems from both theoretical and experimental perspectives .",
    "the need for such confined geometries comes from the fact that the electron - hole ground state formed by the resonant excitation of electrons between a valence and a conduction band of a bulk semiconductor is a metastable bound state with a finite lifetime on the order of a few nanoseconds .",
    "particularly , more recent works in these confined geometries have been carried under zero or strong magnetic fields and , in order to promote the lifetime of the excitons strong external electric fields are also applied by which the exciton lifetime can be increased by a factor of @xmath1 , as compared to their lifetime in the bulk , allowing the thermal equilibrium to be experimentally reached long before they recombine@xcite .",
    "the exciton condensate is a many body collective ground state of electrons and holes , primarily consistent of the fermionic pairs from the s - like electron conduction and the p - like hole valence bands . at low temperatures ,",
    "the fundamental difference between these systems and the conventional bcs - like pairing@xcite is that , the exciton states are formed by nonidentical fermions , i.e. conduction electrons with an effective mass @xmath2 and the p - like heavy holes @xmath3 with @xmath4 the bare electron mass . in addition , the p - like bands are composed of light and heavy holes with the light holes being in a higher valence energy band than the heavy holes .",
    "these properties have important consequences in the manifestation of the fundamental symmetry operations@xcite particularly in the presence of a stabilizing electric field .",
    "the main experimental tool in search for the exciton condensate has been the photoluminesce technique@xcite , and after intense search for years in confined geometries , unquestionable evidence for the condensed state is still lacking @xcite . an important proposition in this direction",
    "was made by combescot and coworkers@xcite which pointed at the crucial role played by the radiative interband interactions between the electron and the hole bands .",
    "since the coulomb interaction is spin - neutral , it may be natural to expect that excitons should come in four degenerate spin configurations . according to the angular momentum selection rules however",
    ", the states ( dark excitons ) composed of total spin @xmath5 do not interact with the radiation field , whereas the states ( bright excitons ) with spin @xmath6 are coupled to it .",
    "this residual interaction of the bright pairs to light is not only responsible for their shorter lifetime but it also creates an effective interaction between the electron - hole bands breaking the four - fold degeneracy to two - fold .",
    "these radiative processes are dipole - like which can be suppressed in double quantum well ( dqw ) geometries by a high tunneling barrier between the electron and the hole rich wells .",
    "these processes are already well known in the normal electron - hole interacting fermi liquid phase@xcite , but their investigation in the condensed phase has not been made until recently@xcite .",
    "it is expected that , the residual radiative interaction can be responsible for the inconclusiveness in the observation of the exciton condensate due to the imbalance created in the relative contributions of the dark and the bright components .",
    "if the ground state is dominated by the dark excitons , this can bring an explanation to why photoluminescence experiments are not conclusive .",
    "the radiative interband processes can be properly taken into account by including the dipole - field interaction that is present for the bright pairs .",
    "the radiation field can then be eliminated using the markov - lindblad formalism to obtain the reduced density matrix for the electrons and the holes , yielding an effective interaction of which the unitary part is an effective hamiltonian for the bright states .",
    "we consider the condensate in the self consistent mean field hartree - fock scheme in the presence of this effective hamiltonian .",
    "from these discussions , we plan to convey the message that , exciton condensation is a broad resource in better understanding some of the unconventional aspects of many body interacting quantum systems from both theoretical and experimental perspectives .",
    "in section.ii we outline the many body microscopic model that is used throughout this work and identify manifestation or absence of the basic symmetries in the problem .",
    "we also summarize therein , the most commonly worked components of this model ( with the radiative transitions and the spin - orbit effects to be discussed in the following sections ) and discuss the consequences of the presence or the absence of the relevant fundamental symmetries in the formation of unconventional pairings .",
    "section.iii is devoted to the investigation of the effects of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and how it enhances pairings with unconventional topologies . in section.iv , and following ref.@xcite a detailed discussion is made on the radiative processes .",
    "using the markov - linblad formalism we project the full hamiltonian onto the fermionic sector which yields an effective reduced hamiltonian at the electron - hole level which reflects the spin dependent splitting between the dark and the bright components .",
    "the order parameters for the dark and bright states were then solved self consistently using the same method that was employed in section.i and shown that , the coupling with the radiation field destroys the bright contribution in the condensed ground state .",
    "excitons , unlike a system of interacting pointlike bosons , are composite particles of mutually interacting constituent fermions in a metastable bound state and live in a fluctuating environment . unlike point bosons , excitons are affected by the additional mechanism between the constituent fermions . when the wave functions of two excitons overlap , the pauli exchange mechanism between the constituent fermions in the same quantum well becomes effective which can change the total spins of the excitons between the initial and the final scattering states .",
    "another spin dependent mechanism is the spontaneous coupling to the radiation field which can happen between a conduction electron and a valence hole with opposite spin states .",
    "another important feature is the bulk or the structural inversion asymmetry in many of the semiconductors that are relevant materials for the study of an exciton condensate .",
    "therefore , in the formulation of this problem one has to include these major effects at the microscopic scale .",
    "the microscopic model hamiltonian in this work is given by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 indicating the individual electron and hole spin states , @xmath10 indicating the electron ( e ) or hole ( h ) degree of freedom , @xmath11 is the free hamiltonian of electrons and holes with @xmath12 indicating the noninteracting single particle energies with band mass @xmath13 measured with respect to individual chemical potentials @xmath14 , @xmath15 includes the complete intraband coulomb electron - electron ( and hole - hole ) interaction with @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the electron - hole coulomb interaction with @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath0 is the layer separation between the electron and hole quantum wells , @xmath20 is the radiative coupling of electrons and holes with dipole strength @xmath21 to the radiation field @xmath22 , and finally @xmath23 is the spin - orbit coupling for electrons or holes with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 as the spin orbit coupling constant .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian in eq.([hamilt_1 ] ) is the starting point to solve the full dynamics of the interacting gas of electrons and holes in a dqw .",
    "the presence of the radiation field coupling to the excitonic dipoles is a weak correction with nonperturbative consequences .",
    "we will not consider these corrections here and handle them in section.iv .",
    "we will also delay discussing the weak soc terms at the moment .",
    "the solution of the sub hamiltonian @xmath26 in eq.([hamilt_1 ] ) was made in ref.@xcite using hartree - fock mean field ( hfmf ) approach . in this approach",
    "the hamiltonian is given by a @xmath27 matrix in the electron - hole spinor basis @xmath28 by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath31 unit matrix , and in standart notation @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the elements of the hamiltonian in eq.([hamilt_3 ] ) are given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the components of the electron and hole self energies and the order parameter matrix @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the eq.s([hfmf_1 ] ) are complemented by the electron and hole number conserving conditions yielding @xmath14 in eq.s([hfmf_1 ] ) .",
    "before we discuss this solution , we outline the fundamental symmetries of which the manifestation or the absence play role in the dynamics and simplifies the self consistent solution of eq.s([hfmf_1 ] ) .",
    "these relevant fundamental symmetries are , the orbital rotation symmetry ( or ) , space parity ( sp ) , the single and double well spin flip symmetries@xcite ( swsf , dwsf ) , the time reversal symmetry ( tr ) and the fermion exchange symmetry ( fx ) which are defined in table.i .",
    ".transformations corresponding to the relevant symmetries in this work are depicted . here",

    "the electron - hole dynamics in semiconductors host many of the most intricate physical processes in many body condensed matter physics .",
    "particularly , in the low temperature regime , the leading processes in understanding the true ground states are not completely resolved .",
    "one distinct historical example is the lack of observation of the wigner crystallization in semiconductors@xcite . on the other hand , from the optimistic side , in semiconductor",
    "coupled electron - hole systems one can have a large number of experimentally controllable parameters some of which have been used in this work .",
    "there are two major conclusions of this work .",
    "firstly , the exact analytical and numerical calculations here indicate that , exciton condensate under strong soc can have a mixed parity ground state in which the singlet and the triplet components of the condensate coexist with the latter being in a mixed parity state .",
    "this is quite contrary to the existing works in which only singlet or the triplet components are considered . here we conclude that the ground state is a mix of singlet and a triplet under strong soc .",
    "however , when the spontaneous coupling to the radiation field is correctly taken into account , as our second conclusion , the singlet vanishes leaving the ground state dominantly as a triplet condensate .",
    "there may be further implications of a purely triplet condensate .",
    "such as system carries an @xmath47 flux - quantum and can support a nontrivial topology with a dirac - cone like energy band structure .",
    "thus , yet a new connection can be made with the recently exciting fields of topological insulators@xcite with a controllable topology .    in this article , we attempted to make a modest case that , exciton condensates pose an opportunity to condensed matter physicist to understand low temperature phenomena ranging from conventional superconductivity to nonconventional spin dependent condensates which can have non trivial topological structures that can even be controlled experimentally in the future .",
    "the surprizes are never ending .",
    "recently we realized that the sharp phase boundary depicted in fig.[fig_delta_triplet ] of the dark order parameter as a function of the layer separation @xmath0 implies that there is an attractive force which , to our knowledge , has not been noticed yet elsewhere .",
    "this force , which we coined as the exciton condensate force @xmath48 , drives its origin from the coulomb interaction , but its is not the coulomb force .",
    "it reminds the universal casimir force , but unlike the casimir force it depends on material parameters and is present only due to the phenomenon of condensation . our ongoing calculations@xcite yield that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the sample area",

    "<S> we investigate the appearance of the singlet and the triplet excitonic condensates under spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and consider realistic couplings to the radiation field as manipulated by the fundamental symmetries related to spin , time , orbital and particle degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the strong soc in inducing a ground state with coexisting singlet and triplet components is shown . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the ground state of an excitonic condensate , in the realistic senario of spontaneous coupling to the radiation field , is dominated by a dark component transparent to photoluminescence . </S>"
