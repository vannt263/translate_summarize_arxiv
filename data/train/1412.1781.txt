    "topological insulators@xcite are a special case of symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases@xcite .",
    "these phases can occur in quantum many - body systems of arbitrary dimension and arbitrary symmetry . by definition",
    ", a gapped quantum many - body system belongs to a ( nontrivial ) spt phase if it satisfies three properties .",
    "first , the hamiltonian is invariant under some set of internal symmetries , none of which are broken spontaneously .",
    "second , the ground state is short - range entangled : that is , it can be transformed into a product state or atomic insulator using a local unitary transformation@xcite .",
    "third , the ground state can not be continuously connected with a product state , by varying some parameter in the hamiltonian , without breaking one of the symmetries or closing the energy gap .",
    "in addition , nontrivial spt phases typically have robust boundary modes@xcite analogous to that of topological insulators , but this property is not part of the formal definition .",
    "chen , gu , liu , and wen@xcite have proposed a general classification scheme for spt phases built out of bosons .",
    "their classification scheme is based on their construction of a collection of exactly soluble lattice boson models of arbitrary symmetry and spatial dimension .",
    "the authors conjecture that these models  called group cohomology models  have two basic properties : ( i ) every group cohomology model belongs to a distinct spt phase and ( ii ) every spt phase can be realized by a group cohomology model .",
    "if both properties hold , then it follows logically that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the group cohomology models and spt phases . in ref .  , the authors assumed this to be the case , and thereby derived a classification scheme for spt phases based on group cohomology .    while the results and arguments of ref .",
    "represent a major advance in our understanding of spt phases , they leave several questions unanswered .",
    "first , it is not obvious that properties ( i)-(ii ) hold in general ( in fact , property ( ii ) is known to fail for spt phases with anti - unitary symmetries@xcite ) .",
    "second , even if these properties do hold at some level , the resulting classification scheme is not completely satisfying since it does nt tell us how to determine to which spt phase a microscopic hamiltonian belongs .    motivated by these problems ,",
    "several proposals have been made for how to physically characterize and distinguish spt phases@xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the suggestion of refs . which applies to 2d and 3d spt models with _ unitary _ symmetries .",
    ".   showed , via a simple example , that one can probe 2d spt models by gauging their symmetries and studying the braiding statistics of the excitations in the resulting gauge theory .",
    "this braiding statistics data is useful because it is invariant under arbitrary symmetry preserving deformations of the hamiltonian , as long as the energy gap remains open .",
    "therefore , if two spt models give rise to different braiding statistics , then they must belong to distinct spt phases.@xcite the braiding statistics approach can also be applied to 3d spt phases.@xcite in that case , after gauging the symmetry , one studies the braiding statistics of the vortex loop excitations in the resulting gauge theory .",
    "more specifically , different spt phases can be distinguished by examining their _ three - loop _ braiding statistics  the statistics associated with braiding a loop @xmath0 around another loop @xmath1 , while they are both linked to a third loop @xmath2 .",
    "when considered together , the braiding statistics approach and the group cohomology construction raise several questions :    1 .",
    "does every group cohomology model lead to distinct braiding statistics?@xcite 2 .",
    "do the group cohomology models exhaust all possible types of braiding statistics that can occur in spt systems ?",
    "if two spt models give rise to the same braiding statistics , do they always belong to the same phase ?    the answers to these questions have powerful implications , especially if we can answer them affirmatively .",
    "for example , if we can answer the first question in the affirmative , we can immediately conclude that every group cohomology model belongs to a distinct phase .",
    "likewise , if we can answer the second and third questions in the affirmative , then we can conclude that the group cohomology models realize all possible spt phases . if we can answer all three questions affirmatively",
    ", then it follows that ( 1 ) the group cohomology classification is correct and ( 2 ) the braiding statistics data provides a universal probe for characterizing and distinguishing different spt phases with unitary symmetries .    in this work , we consider the first and second questions for the case of 2d and 3d spt phases with finite abelian unitary symmetry group @xmath3 .",
    "we answer the first question in the affirmative and we find evidence that the same is true for the second question , as we explain below .",
    "we obtain our results by focusing on a subset of the braiding statistics data that summarizes some of its most important features ( in fact for systems with abelian statistics , this subset is equivalent to the full set of braiding data , see section [ sec : relation ] ) . in the 2d case ,",
    "this subset consists of @xmath4 tensors , @xmath5 that take values in @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 . in the 3d case",
    ", it consists of @xmath4 tensors @xmath8 with @xmath9",
    ". these tensors  which we call _ topological invariants _  are defined by considering the berry phase associated with certain composite braiding processes of vortices or vortex loops .",
    "conveniently , these berry phases are always abelian phases regardless of whether the full set of braiding statistics is abelian or non - abelian .",
    "we report two main results .",
    "first , we show that the topological invariants take different values in every group cohomology model .",
    "second , we show that the group cohomology models exhaust all possible values for the topological invariants in the 2d case and we give some evidence for this in the 3d case .",
    "our first result implies that the group cohomology models all belong to distinct phases .",
    "our second result can be interpreted as evidence that the group cohomology models realize all possible spt phases with finite abelian unitary symmetry group .",
    "some of our results have appeared previously in the literature , though in a slightly different form .",
    "in particular , in the 2d case , ref .   introduced invariants similar to ours and showed that the invariants can distinguish all the 2d group cohomology models . also , much of our analysis of 3d gauge theories is similar to that of our previous work , ref .  .",
    "however , this paper goes further than ref .   in three key ways .",
    "first , we study both abelian and non - abelian loop braiding statistics , while ref .   only studied abelian statistics .",
    "second , we consider a general finite abelian symmetry group @xmath10 while ref .   only considered groups of the form @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we make a systematic comparison between the topological invariants and the group cohomology classification , while ref .   only made this comparison in a few examples .    a note on our terminology : throughout the paper , we will refer to gauged spt models as simply _",
    "gauge theories_. also , we will refer to the gauged group cohomology models as _ dijkgraaf - witten models_@xcite .",
    "the dijkgraaf - witten models were studied long before the discovery of spt phases , however it can be shown that they are equivalent to the gauged group cohomology models ( the equivalence is discussed in appendix [ sec : appd_dijkgraafwitten ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the models that we will study , both the general gauged spt models and the more specific dijkgraaf - witten models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : defining_theta ] , we discuss the general structure of braiding statistics in gauged spt models and we define the topological invariants .",
    "next , we compute the topological invariants in 2d and 3d dijkgraaf - witten models in sec .  [",
    "sec : dijkgraafwitten ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : distinguishingdw ] , we show that the topological invariants take different values in every dijkgraaf - witten model . in sec .  [",
    "sec : generalconstraint ] , we derive general constraints that the topological invariants must satisfy in any gauged spt model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : beyondcohomology ] , we discuss whether the dijkgraaf - witten models exhaust all possible values for the invariants .",
    "the relation between the topological invariants and the full set of braiding statistics in the case of abelian statistics is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : relation ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude and discuss the implications of our results for spt phases . the appendices contain several technical details .",
    "the main systems we will study in this paper are 2d and 3d lattice gauge theories with finite abelian gauge group , @xmath12 . more specifically , we will study a particular class of gauge theories that are obtained from a two step construction .",
    "the first step of the construction is to pick a 2d or 3d lattice boson or spin model with a global @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "this boson model can be quite general , with the only restrictions being that ( 1 ) it has local interactions , ( 2 ) the symmetry is an internal ( on - site ) symmetry rather than a spatial symmetry , and ( 3 ) its ground state is gapped and short - range entangled  that is , the ground state can be transformed into a product state by a local unitary transformation . here , by a local unitary transformation , we mean a unitary tranformation @xmath14 of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a local hermitian operator and @xmath17 is a finite constant that does not scale with the system size.@xcite ( note that the transformation @xmath14 need not commute with the symmetry ) .",
    "the second step of the construction is to gauge the global symmetry of the lattice boson model and couple it to a dynamical lattice gauge field with group @xmath18 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appd_gauging ] , we give a precise prescription for how to implement this gauging procedure .",
    "this prescription mostly follows the usual minimal coupling scheme@xcite .",
    "however , there is one nonstandard element that is worth mentioning : our procedure is defined so that the gauge coupling constant is _",
    "exactly zero_. more precisely , what we mean by this is that the hamiltonian for the gauged model commutes with the flux operators that measure the gauge flux through each plaquette in the lattice . this property is convenient because it makes the low energy physics of our models well - controlled . in particular , using this property it can be shown that the gauge theories constructed via our gauging procedure are guaranteed to be gapped and deconfined as long as the original boson models are gapped and do nt break the symmetry spontaneously ( see appendix [ sec : appd_gauging ] ) .",
    "the above two step construction defines the class of models that we will study in this paper . from now on ,",
    "when we use the term _ gauge theory _ we will be referring exclusively to models of this type , unless we state otherwise .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to mention that although we find it convenient to use the particular gauging prescription in appendix [ sec : appd_gauging ] , we do nt expect that our results actually depend on the details of the gauging procedure , or on the fact that the resulting gauge theories have zero gauge coupling .",
    "indeed , our results are guaranteed to hold for any model that can be continuously connected one of the above gauge theories without closing the energy gap .",
    "we expect that the latter category includes models obtained from generic gauging procedures , as long as the gauge coupling constant is sufficiently small .      in part of this work we will study a particular set of exactly soluble gauge theories , known as dijkgraaf - witten models@xcite which are obtained by gauging the group cohomology models of ref . .",
    "we now briefly review the properties of the group cohomology models and the corresponding dijkgraaf - witten models .",
    "for the explicit definition of these models , see appendix [ sec : appd_dijkgraafwitten ] .",
    "the group cohomology models are exactly soluble lattice boson models that can be defined in any spatial dimension @xmath19 .",
    "the basic input needed to construct a @xmath19-dimensional group cohomology model is a ( finite ) group @xmath18 and a @xmath20 cocycle @xmath21 . here , an @xmath22-cocycle @xmath21 is a function @xmath23 that satisfies certain conditions .",
    "one may define an equivalence relation on cocycles and the equivalence classes are labeled by the elements of the cohomology group @xmath24 $ ] ( a brief introduction to group cohomology@xcite is given in appendix [ sec : appd_cohomology ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the models constructed from equivalent cocycles are identical so we will say that the @xmath19-dimensional group cohomology models are labeled by elements of @xmath25 $ ] .    like the group cohomology models ,",
    "the basic input needed to construct a dijkgraaf - witten model in spatial dimension @xmath19 is a group @xmath18 and a @xmath26cocycle @xmath21 .",
    "also , like the group cohomology models , the dijkgraaf - witten models constructed from equivalent cocycles are the same , so we will say that they are labeled by different elements of @xmath25 $ ] . here",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath27 and @xmath28 .      before proceeding further , we briefly review some results on the relationship between spt models , gauge theories , and braiding statistics .",
    "we begin by defining _",
    "phases _ of spt models and phases of gauge theories .",
    "the former definition is relatively simple : we say that two lattice boson models with the same symmetry group belong to the same spt phase if they can be continuously connected to one another by varying some parameter in the ( symmetry - preserving ) hamiltonian , without closing the energy gap .",
    "defining phases of gauge theories is more subtle .",
    "in fact , there are two inequivalent ways to define this concept , both of which have their merits . in the first definition ,",
    "two gauge theories belong to the same phase if they can be continuously connected by varying some parameter in the ( gauge invariant ) hamiltonian without closing the energy gap . in the second definition , not only",
    "do we require the existence of an interpolating hamiltonian with an energy gap , but we also demand that the interpolating hamiltonian has _ vanishing gauge coupling _  that is , the hamiltonian must commute with the flux operators that measure the gauge flux through each plaquette in the lattice . while the first definition is very natural",
    "if one is interested in gauge theories for their own sake , the second definition is more relevant to the study of spt phases . in this paper ,",
    "our primary interest is in spt phases so we will use the second definition .    in parallel to the two ways of defining phases of gauge theories , there are also two ways to define what is means for two gauge theories to have the `` same '' braiding statistics data .",
    "in the first definition , two gauge theories have the same braiding statistics data if one can map the excitations of one gauge theory onto the excitations of the other gauge theory such that the corresponding excitations have identical braiding statistics . in the second definition ,",
    "the corresponding excitations are required both to have the same braiding statistics _ and _ the same gauge flux . in this paper",
    ", we will use the second definition , since it fits more naturally with our definition of phases of gauge theories . with these definitions in mind , we can now discuss some results .",
    "an important observation is that if two lattice boson models belong to the same spt phase , then the corresponding gauged models must also belong to the same phase . to see this , note that our gauging prescription ( appendix [ sec : appd_gauging ] ) maps gapped lattice boson models onto gapped zero - coupling gauge theories ; hence , any continuous interpolation between two spt models can be gauged to give an interpolation between the two corresponding gauge theories .",
    "another important observation is that if two gauge theories belong to the same phase , then they must have the same braiding statistics .",
    "one way to see this is to note that braiding statistics data can only take on discrete values and can not change continuously .",
    "( this discreteness property is known as _ ocneanu rigidity _",
    "@xcite ) . combining the above two observations",
    ", we derive a useful corollary : if two lattice boson models belong to the same spt phase then they must give rise to the same braiding statistics after gauging their symmetries .",
    "the converse of this statement may also be true , but it is not obvious .",
    "in this section , we construct a set of topological invariants for gauge theories with gauge group @xmath29 .",
    "( here , when we say `` gauge theory '' , we mean a gauge theory of the type discussed in section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "these invariants are defined in terms of the braiding statistics@xcite of the excitations of the gauge theory .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath30 in the 2d case and @xmath31 in the 3d case , where the indices @xmath32 range over @xmath33 . for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "we first define the invariants in the case where the braiding statistics are abelian , and then discuss the general case ( where the statistics may be abelian or non - abelian ) .",
    "we start with the simplest case : we consider 2d gauge theories with group @xmath29 and with abelian braiding statistics .",
    "we first discuss the excitation spectrum of these gauge theories . in general , every excitation @xmath0 in a discrete gauge theory@xcite can be labeled by the amount of gauge flux @xmath34 that it carries . in our case , the gauge flux @xmath34 can be described by a @xmath35-component vector @xmath36 where each component @xmath37 is a multiple of @xmath38 , and is defined modulo @xmath39 .",
    "excitations can be divided into two groups : _ charge _ excitations that carry vanishing gauge flux and _ vortex _ excitations that carry nonzero gauge flux .",
    "as far as their topological properties go , charge excitations are uniquely characterized by their gauge charge @xmath40 where each component @xmath41 is defined modulo @xmath42 . in contrast , vortex excitations are _ not _ uniquely characterized by the amount of gauge flux that they carry : in fact , there are @xmath43 different types of vortices carrying the same flux @xmath44 . all of these vortices can be obtained by attaching charge excitations to a fixed reference vortex with flux @xmath44 . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use greek letters @xmath45 to denote vortices as well as general excitations , and we will use the letter @xmath46 to denote both a charge excitation and its gauge charge .    before proceeding further , we would like to point out a possible source of confusion : given what we have said about the different types of vortices , it is tempting to try to label vortex excitations by _ both _ their gauge flux and their gauge charge .",
    "the problem with this approach is that we do not know any physically meaningful way to define the absolute charge carried by a vortex excitation in a discrete gauge theory .",
    "therefore we will avoid using this notion in this paper .",
    "instead , we will only use the concept of _ relative _ charge : we will say that two vortices @xmath47 _ differ _ by charge @xmath46 if @xmath48 can be obtained by attaching a charge excitation @xmath46 to @xmath0 .",
    "let us now consider the braiding statistics of the different excitations .",
    "there are three different braiding processes to consider : braiding of two charges , braiding of a charge around a vortex , and braiding of two vortices .",
    "the first process is easy to analyze : indeed , it is clear that the charges correspond to local excitations in the ungauged short - range - entangled bosonic state .",
    "therefore the charges are all bosons and have trivial ( bosonic ) mutual statistics .",
    "the braiding between a charge and a vortex is also easy to understand , as it follows from the aharanov - bohm law .",
    "more specifically , the statistical berry phase @xmath49 associated with braiding a charge @xmath46 around a vortex with flux @xmath44 is given by @xmath50 where `` @xmath51 '' is the vector inner product .",
    "note that attaching a charge to the vortex does not change the aharanov - bohm law since the charges have trivial mutual statistics with respect to one another .    from the above arguments",
    ", we see that the charge - charge and charge - vortex statistics are completely fixed by the gauge group , leaving no room for variation .",
    "therefore , the only braiding process that has potential for distinguishing gauge theories with the same gauge group is vortex - vortex braiding .",
    "motivated by this observation , we will define the topological invariants @xmath52 in terms of the vortex - vortex braiding statistics .",
    "let @xmath0 be a vortex carrying a unit flux @xmath53 , where @xmath54 with a @xmath55 is the @xmath56th entry and @xmath57 everywhere else .",
    "let @xmath1 be a vortex carrying a unit flux @xmath58 . here , @xmath56 and @xmath59 can take any value in @xmath33 .",
    "we define @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mutual statistics between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath62 is the exchange statistics of @xmath0 , and @xmath63 is the least common multiple of @xmath42 and @xmath64 ( more generally , throughout the paper , we use @xmath65 to denote the least common multiple of @xmath66 and use @xmath67 to denote the greatest common divisor of @xmath66 ) .    for the quantities @xmath68 and @xmath69 to be well - defined , we need to check that @xmath70 and @xmath71 only depend on @xmath56 and @xmath59 , and not on the choice of the vortices @xmath72 . to see that this is the case , imagine that we replace @xmath72 with some other vortices @xmath73 carrying flux @xmath53 and @xmath58",
    ". then clearly the vortices @xmath0 and @xmath48 differ only by the attachment of charge , as do @xmath1 and @xmath74 . therefore",
    ", according to the aharonov - bohm law , the change in @xmath68 that occurs when we replace @xmath75 , @xmath76 is @xmath77 where @xmath78 are integers that describe the amount of type-@xmath56 and type-@xmath59 charge that is attached to @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "but @xmath63 is divisible by both @xmath42 and @xmath64 so we see that this replacement does not change @xmath68 modulo @xmath39 . similarly , the aharonov - bohm law tells us that the change in @xmath69 that occurs when we replace @xmath75 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the type-@xmath56 charge that is attached to @xmath0 . thus @xmath69 is also unchanged modulo @xmath39 .",
    "we conclude that the quantities @xmath68 and @xmath69 are both well - defined .",
    "in addition to being well - defined , it is possible to show that @xmath68 and @xmath69 have another nice property : they contain the same information as the full set of braiding statistics .",
    "we will derive this result in sec .",
    "[ sec : relation ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we move on to general 2d gauge theories with gauge group @xmath29 . unlike the previous section",
    ", we do not assume that the braiding statistics of the excitations is abelian .",
    "this additional generality is important because , contrary to naive expectations , gauge theories with abelian gauge groups can sometimes have excitations with non - abelian statistics .",
    "for example , this phenomenon occurs in 2d @xmath10 dijkgraaf - witten models when @xmath81 ( c.f .",
    "ref .  ) .    in the general case",
    ", we will define three topological invariants @xmath30 .",
    "the first two @xmath52 reduce to those defined in ( [ 2d_theta ] ) when restricted to abelian statistics .",
    "the third invariant @xmath82 is new to the non - abelian case , and vanishes in the abelian case .",
    "many features of the abelian case carry over to the general case without change .",
    "first , we can still label every excitation @xmath0 by the amount of gauge flux @xmath83 that it carries , where @xmath37 is a multiple of @xmath38 and is defined modulo @xmath39 . also , we can still divide excitations into two groups : _ charges _ , that carry vanishing flux , and _ vortices _ that carry nonzero flux .",
    "charge excitations are still characterized uniquely by their gauge charge @xmath84 with @xmath41 defined modulo @xmath42 , while vortices are still characterized _ non - uniquely _ by their gauge flux . finally , charges are still abelian particles with trivial charge - charge statistics , and with charge - vortex statistics given by the aharonov - bohm law : @xmath85 where @xmath44 is the gauge flux carried by the vortex .",
    "the main new element in the general case is that vortices can be non - abelian , i.e. , they can have non - abelian fusion rules and non - abelian braiding statistics with one another@xcite .",
    "while the possibility of non - abelian vortices complicates our analysis , we can still make some general statements about the fusion rules and braiding statistics in these systems . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on the fusion rules , and we list some properties which will be useful in our later arguments ( see appendix [ sec : appd_fusionprop ] for proofs and details ) .",
    "to begin , imagine we fuse together two excitations @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in general",

    "one property of these fusion rules is that @xmath89 for any fusion product @xmath2 . in particular , if @xmath90 , then all the @xmath2 s that appear on the right hand side of ( [ fusion1 ] ) are pure charges .",
    "a second property is that the fusion of a charge @xmath46 and an excitation @xmath0 always results in a single excitation @xmath91 where @xmath48 is not necessarily distinct from @xmath0 and @xmath92 .",

    "more specifically , one can argue that the phase associated with this braiding process is equal to that of braiding the loop @xmath442 around @xmath443 for @xmath63 times , while both @xmath424 are linked to a base loop which carries a flux @xmath444 .",
    "now since @xmath445 modulo @xmath39 , @xmath424 are not linked to any base loop so this phase can be computed from the aharonov - bohm law , as in equation ( [ 3dabohm ] ) . in this way , we deduce that @xmath446 combining this with @xmath438 , we derive the constraint ( [ 3dconstraint_quant ] ) .",

    "if the answer to this question is `` yes '' , then it follows that there exist gauge theories that do not belong to the same phase as any of the dijkgraaf - witten models . on the other hand ,",

    "we conclude that in the 2d case , the dijkgraaf - witten models exhaust all possible values of the invariants .",

    "one loophole is that the last constraint ( [ 3dconstraint_cyclic3 ] ) is simply a _",
    "conjecture_. therefore , all we can say is that the dijkgraaf - witten models exhaust all possible values of the invariants , assuming this conjecture is correct .",

    "in this case , we have only managed to prove very weak constraints on the invariants , as discussed in the previous section . as a result",

    "hence , we can not make any statements as to whether the dijkgraaf - witten models exhaust all possible values of the invariants .",

    "follow immediately from ( [ unitflux2 ] ) together with the linearity relations ( [ linearity_2d ] ) and ( [ linearity_2d_exch ] ) .",

    "we choose the @xmath41 so that the new vortex loops @xmath461 obey @xmath481 the fact that we can always find such a @xmath41 follows from the same reasoning as in the 2d case .",

    "similarly , every loop excitation in the second gauge theory can be written uniquely as a product of the @xmath461 vortex loops as in equation ( [ rep2 ] ) .",
    "we can therefore define a one - to - one correspondence using the mapping in equation ( [ 2dmap ] ) . for the same reasons as in the 2d case",
    ", it is clear that this correspondence preserves the statistics of the loop excitations , as well as their gauge flux .",
    "to finish the derivation , we need to generalize the above one - to - one correspondence to the case where the base loop carries arbitrary flux @xmath44 .",
    "this generalization is easy to prove since we can construct base loops with arbitrary flux by fusing together base loops with unit flux using the `` @xmath413 '' fusion process ( see fig .",

    ". putting these pieces together , we can construct a similar one - to - one correspondence between loop excitations that are linked with base loops with arbitrary flux .",
    "this completes our argument and proves that the two gauge theories have identical three - loop statistics .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the braiding statistics of 2d and 3d gauge theories with group @xmath29 , and we have defined topological invariants that summarize some of the most important aspects of this braiding structure . in the 2d case , these invariants consist of three tensors , @xmath482 , while in the 3d case , they consist of three tensors , @xmath483 . these tensors are defined in terms of certain composite braiding processes involving vortices and vortex loops .    using these invariants ,",
    "we have obtained two results .",

    "this result has an immediate implication : the 2d and 3d group cohomology models with group @xmath18 all belong to distinct phases .",
    "next , we consider our finding that the 2d dijkgraaf - witten models exhaust all possible values for the invariants .",
    "while we can not draw rigorous conclusions from this result , it is at least consistent with the possibility that the 2d group cohomology models realize all possible spt phases with symmetry group @xmath18 .",
    "our 3d results on this topic are also consistent with this possibility , though they are somewhat weaker .    in short ,",
    "our results support the group cohomology classification conjecture of chen , gu , liu , and wen@xcite , for the case of finite , abelian symmetry group @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , our results allow us to go further : they provide a simple diagnostic for determining whether a specific microscopic hamiltonian belongs to the same phase as a specific group cohomology model .",
    "the diagnostic involves gauging the hamiltonian and then computing the topological invariants of the associated gauge theory .",
    "if the invariants for the microscopic hamiltonian are different from that of the group cohomology model , then we may conclude that the hamiltonian belongs to a distinct phase .",
    "if the invariants are the same , then it may belong to the same phase , though we can not be certain because we do not know if the invariants are complete in the sense that they distinguish all possible spt phases .",
    "we see this work as a first step towards answering the three questions raised in the introduction .",
    "we have managed to make some progress on these questions for the special case of abelian symmetry groups , but many issues remain unresolved .",
    "first , although we have partially answered questions 1 - 2 from the introduction , we have said nothing at all about question 3  which asks whether the braiding statistics data can distinguish all possible spt phases . another important direction for future work is to understand the braiding statistics in gauge theories with _ non - abelian _ gauge group and see if similar topological invariants could be defined in that context .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to study gauge theories associated with fermionic spt models .",

    "we now show that the dijkgraaf - witten model with group @xmath18 and cocycle @xmath21 is equivalent to the group cohomology model of the same group @xmath18 and cocycle @xmath21 after the global symmetry of the latter is gauged .    to gauge the symmetry in the group cohomology model , we introduce lattice gauge fields @xmath582 that live on the links @xmath556 $ ] of the triangulation .",
    "we then couple",
    "the matter degrees of freedom @xmath559 and gauge degrees of freedom @xmath571 by replacing each @xmath583 in the action ( [ spt_action ] ) by @xmath584 , following the minimal coupling procedure . after this step ,",

    "we can see that @xmath588 is identical to @xmath579 , proving that the gauged group cohomology model with group @xmath18 and cocycle @xmath21 is equivalent to the dijkgraaf - witten model with the same @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "in this appendix , we derive some properties of the fusion rules of excitations in 2d gauge theories with group @xmath155 .",
    "the first property is that any excitation @xmath2 that appears in the fusion product @xmath595 must obey @xmath596 .",
    "this property is clear from the following thought experiment .",
    "imagine braiding an arbitrary charge @xmath46 around @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one can braid @xmath46 around @xmath0 and @xmath1 sequentially , which gives a phase @xmath597 . or , one can first fuse @xmath0 and @xmath1 into some @xmath2 , then braid @xmath46 around @xmath2 , leading to a phase @xmath598 .",
    "clearly the two processes should give the same phase , so @xmath599 .",
    "since @xmath46 is arbitrary , we have @xmath600 .",
    "another property of the fusion rules is that when an excitation @xmath0 is fused with a charge @xmath46 , there is exactly one fusion outcome : @xmath601 where @xmath48 might be the same as @xmath0 . to prove this property , we imagine four excitations @xmath602 and @xmath603 , where @xmath604 denotes the antiparticle of @xmath0 and we suppose that the overall fusion channel for the four excitations is the vacuum .",
    "we now count the degeneracy of this four - excitation space in two different ways .",
    "first , we note that @xmath603 are abelian particles , so they must fuse to the vacuum , which in turn forces @xmath605 to fuse to the vacuum .",
    "so , the four - excitation space is non - degenerate . on the other hand",
    ", we can also fuse the particles in a different order : we first fuse @xmath46 with @xmath0 and fuse @xmath606 with @xmath607 , then fuse the resulting particles .",
    "if we fuse the particles in this way , we can see that the degeneracy is given by the number of different fusion outcomes in @xmath608 .",
    "we conclude that there is a unique fusion outcome in @xmath608",
    ". therefore , ( [ qa ] ) holds .",
    "the third property is that an excitation @xmath0 and its anti - particle @xmath607 can only fuse to charges , i.e. @xmath609 where @xmath610 denotes the vacuum .",
    "moreover , the coefficient of each @xmath41 appearing in the fusion rule is 1 .",
    "the first statement is easy to prove : all particles on the right side must be charges since @xmath611 .",
    "to prove that the coefficient associated with each @xmath41 is 1 , we use the fact that @xmath612 from the general algebraic theory of anyons@xcite . from this fact ,",
    "we derive @xmath613 , where the last equality follows from property ( [ qa ] ) . as a corollary",
    ", we see that the charges @xmath41 appearing in ( [ e1 ] ) are exactly those that follow the fusion rule @xmath614 .    with the above properties , we now prove two claims .",
    "the first claim states that for any two excitations @xmath47 with @xmath92 , there exists at least one charge @xmath46 with @xmath94 .",
    "the second claim is more complicated . to explain it , consider two excitations @xmath72 in a fusion channel @xmath2 , and two other excitations @xmath615 in a fusion channel @xmath97",
    "the claim states if @xmath95 and @xmath96 then there exist charges @xmath98 and @xmath99 such that @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "to prove the first claim , consider an arbitrary excitation @xmath48 with @xmath616 .",
    "imagine fusing together @xmath617 .",
    "we can do the fusion in two different orders , @xmath618 and @xmath619 where the `` @xmath620 '' means some charges . since the order of fusion ca nt affect the final result ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath621 , where @xmath622 is one of the charges in ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "hence , the claim holds .    to prove the second claim ,",
    "let @xmath623 be any excitations with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath2 be one of the fusion channels of @xmath72 and let @xmath97 be one of the fusion channels of @xmath615 .",
    "our task is to show that , given any state in @xmath624 , we can construct at least one state in @xmath625 by fusing charges onto @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to show this",
    ", we note that @xmath626 for some charge @xmath46 , by the first claim , proven above .",
    "let us consider the fusion product @xmath627 .",
    "the vacuum fusion channel must appear at least once in this fusion product since @xmath628 and @xmath629 contains the vacuum .",
    "we can now reorder the fusion product as @xmath630 this reordering should nt change the result so the vacuum must also appear in this product .",
    "we conclude @xmath46 can be written as a product @xmath631 where @xmath98 appears in the fusion product of @xmath632 and @xmath99 belongs to the fusion product of @xmath633 .",
    "clearly @xmath98 and @xmath99 satisfy @xmath634 and @xmath635 . also , we know that @xmath636 .",
    "this proves the claim .",
    "in this appendix , we show that when an excitation is braided around another identical excitation in a 2d gauge theory with group @xmath29 , the resulting unitary transformation is a pure phase , i.e. , proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "note that this result only holds for a full braiding : the unitary transformation associated with an exchange of two identical excitations need not be a pure phase .",
    "consider an arbitrary excitation @xmath0 in a 2d gauge theory with group @xmath29 .",
    "in the first step , we show that the unitary transformation associated with braiding @xmath0 around its antiparticle @xmath604 is a pure phase . to see this , note that according to appendix [ sec : appd_fusionprop ] , the only fusion outcomes for @xmath0 and @xmath604 are charges :",
    "@xmath638 . for any @xmath46 that appears in this fusion rule , we can use the formula ( [ appdf_braiding ] ) to derive @xmath639 where we have used the facts @xmath640 , @xmath641 and @xmath642 . examining the above identity , we can see that the statistical phase associated with braiding @xmath0 around @xmath126 is independent of the fusion channel @xmath46 .",
    "hence , braiding @xmath0 around @xmath126 gives a pure phase .",
    "next , we show that all the charges @xmath46 that appear in the fusion product @xmath643 have vanishing braiding statistics with @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath644 . to see this , imagine we have two excitations @xmath0 and @xmath126 in the vacuum fusion channel .",
    "if we now fuse @xmath46 to @xmath126 , the excitation @xmath604 will remain unchanged ( i.e. @xmath645 ) but after this fusion process , the two excitations @xmath0 and @xmath604 will be in the fusion channel @xmath46 .",
    "let us imagine braiding @xmath0 around @xmath126 before and after fusing @xmath46 into @xmath126 .",
    "clearly the two processes will differ by a phase factor @xmath646 .",
    "hence @xmath647 then since @xmath648 is independent of @xmath46 , we derive @xmath649 .    to complete the argument",
    ", we consider a process in which @xmath0 is braided around a pair of @xmath0 and @xmath126 excitations .",
    "independent of the fusion channel of the @xmath0 and @xmath126 excitations , the unitary transformation associated with this process must be the identity since @xmath644 . at the same time",
    ", this braiding process can be divided into two pieces : first @xmath0 is braided around @xmath126 , and then around another @xmath0 . since the first piece is a pure phase @xmath650 , the second must also be a pure phase .",
    "this proves the claim . in addition",
    ", we have derived the formula @xmath651 where @xmath1 is any excitation in the fusion product @xmath115 .",
    "in this appendix , we prove that @xmath82 is a well defined quantities .",
    "more specifically , we show that ( i ) the unitary transformation associated with the braiding process defining @xmath82 is always an abelian phase even if the vortices are non - abelian ; we also show that ( ii ) the abelian phase is a function of @xmath122 only and does not depend on the choice of vortices @xmath123 as long as they carry fluxes @xmath104 respectively .",
    "to prove points ( i ) and ( ii ) , we make use of a diagrammatic technique to compute the unitary matrix associated with the braiding process in the definition of @xmath82 ( for more details about this diagrammatic technique , see ref .  .",
    ") the technique uses space - time trajectories , where the arrow of time is drawn upward .",
    "we will not use the technique to carry out an actual calculation but only to show that the unitary transformation associated with @xmath82 is a pure phase .",
    "we will make use of two diagrammatic relations in our proof .",
    "the first relation is @xmath652 this relation allows us to turn downward a trajectory of @xmath0 by introducing its antiparticle @xmath126 , with a compensation of a complex factor @xmath653 .",
    "the factor @xmath653 is related to the quantum dimension @xmath112 by @xmath654 .",
    "the second relation is @xmath655 which means that the propagation of two particles @xmath72 can be decomposed into a sum over their possible fusion channels , where @xmath2 ranges over the fusion channels in @xmath595 and @xmath22 ranges over @xmath656 .",
    "the vertices @xmath657{figineq_vertex.eps}\\nonumber\\ ] ] mean the @xmath22th way of splitting and fusing @xmath128 into @xmath2 respectively",
    ".    now let @xmath103 be vortices carrying unit flux @xmath358 respectively .",
    "consider the space - time trajectories of @xmath103 associated with the braiding process in the definition of @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_thetaijk ] ) .",

    "[ fig_thetaijk ] .",
    "the second equation is established by using the relation ( [ diagrelation2 ] ) in the two shaded regions in the second diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig_thetaijk ] .",
    "the charges @xmath658 are those appearing in the fusion rule of @xmath643 .",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath659 for any @xmath46 , which is proven in appendix [ sec : appd_fusionprop ] . to establish the third equation",
    ", we notice that @xmath658 have abelian statistics with the vortices @xmath660 . winding @xmath46 around @xmath2 in the counterclockwise direction",
    "gives rise to a phase @xmath661 , and winding @xmath662 around @xmath1 in the clockwise direction gives rise to a phase @xmath663 . in the fourth diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig_thetaijk ] , we see that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are decoupled from @xmath0 , while @xmath0 still has some `` self - interaction '' .",
    "however complicated this `` self - interaction '' is , it only depends on @xmath664 , but not on @xmath665 .",
    "therefore , we can denote everything as a complex number @xmath666 , after the summation over @xmath658 has been performed .",
    "we see that @xmath666 only depends on the flux of @xmath660 , but not on the choice of @xmath660 , nor on their fusion channel .",
    "since the overall transformation must be unitary , @xmath666 is a pure phase .    to complete the argument",

    ", one can easily see that @xmath668 with this , we have shown that @xmath82 only depends on the flux of @xmath103 , i.e. it only depends on @xmath122 .",
    "hence , @xmath82 is well defined .",
    "in this appendix , we show how to translate between the mathematical labels @xmath669 , used to denote excitations in 2d dijkgraaf - witten models , and the physical notions of gauge flux and gauge charge .",
    "as discussed in the main text , the basic outline of correspondence is simple : the first component @xmath241 describes the amount of flux carried by the excitation @xmath0 , while the second component @xmath235 is related to the amount of charge attached to @xmath0 .",
    "we now explain how this works in more detail .    for each group element @xmath670 ,",
    "the corresponding gauge flux is given by @xmath671 where @xmath672 .",
    "likewise , for each representation @xmath235 we should define a corresponding gauge charge @xmath673 .",
    "this correspondence is easy to define for the case where @xmath0 is a pure charge excitation : @xmath674 . indeed in this case ,",
    "( [ projective ] ) implies that @xmath235 is a _ linear _ representation of @xmath18  provided that we choose a `` gauge''@xcite such that @xmath675 if any of @xmath676 is @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that @xmath235 can be written in the form @xmath677 for some integer vector @xmath678 .",
    "this defines the desired correspondence @xmath679 .",
    "how does the correspondence work for vortex excitations @xmath680 where @xmath681 ? in this case , @xmath235 is a _ projective _ representation , so there is no natural way to translate @xmath235 into an integer vector @xmath678 .",
    "this is related to the general point made in section [ sec:2dabelian1 ] : we do not know a physically meaningful way to define the absolute charge carried by a vortex excitation . on the other hand ,",
    "if we _ compare _ two vortex excitations with the same flux , @xmath680 and @xmath682 , and we find that @xmath683 are related by @xmath684 for some @xmath685 , then we can say that @xmath48 can be obtained from @xmath0 by attaching charge @xmath686 .",
    "in this section , we show that if @xmath166 and @xmath167 obey the constraints ( [ 3dconstraint_exch])-([3dconstraint_cyclic3 ] ) , then they can be written in the form ( [ theta_value_3d1])-([theta_value_3d2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath687 for some integer tensor @xmath331 . the first step is rewrite the second equation as @xmath688 this new form of the second equation can be derived from the relations @xmath689 which in turn follow from the identities @xmath690    we now construct the integer tensor @xmath331 .",

    "second , we have to show that we can always find integers @xmath698 satisfying ( [ abrel ] ) .",
    "the fact that the components of @xmath331 are all integers is easy to prove , as it follows immediately from the two constraints ( [ 3dconstraint_quant_ex ] ) , ( [ 3dconstraint_quant ] ) . as for the second statement , this will follow if we can show that @xmath699 and @xmath700 are relatively prime .",
    "the latter property can be derived from a simple observation : we note that the only prime factors appearing in @xmath699 are those that divide into @xmath59 more times than either @xmath56 or @xmath480 .",
    "similarly , the only prime factors appearing in @xmath700 are those that divide into @xmath56 more times than @xmath59 or @xmath480 .",
