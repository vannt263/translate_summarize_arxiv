    "the problem of the generation of magnetic fields is an old one in cosmology @xcite . the general approach is to identify mechanisms for the generation of seed fields @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "which can become amplified into fields on galactic scales .",
    "considerable attention has been focused on generation of seed fields during cosmic phase transitions , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , particularly at the electroweak transition @xcite , or at the qcd transition through formation of electromagnetic fields in the collision of shock fronts @xcite or formation of dipole charge layers on the surfaces of phase transition bubble walls whose motion generates an electromagnetic current and hence a magnetic field @xcite . always present as a source of seed fields are random magnetic field fluctuations on a scale of order a thermal wavelength .",
    "once one has identified the source of microscale seed fields , it is necessary to find how they are transformed into macroscopic scale magnetic fields , a process requiring production of current loops on large size scales , and thus the generation of a level of vorticity in the fluid .    in this paper we focus on the generation and amplification of fields at the electroweak phase transition , by means of the fluid , and hence magnetic , turbulence which should be formed there . during a first - order electroweak phase transition bubbles of the new phase form @xcite-@xcite [ but see arguments in ref . @xcite",
    "why the transition , even if first order transition , need not necessarily proceed dynamically via domain wall formation ] .",
    "then , as we argue in sec .",
    "ii , bubble collisions generate a level of turbulence and hence vorticity in the fluid . as a bubble propagates through the electroweak plasma , it generates a precursor shock front which accelerates the fluid outside the burning front of the bubble .",
    "as the shock fronts from different bubbles collide , they generate turbulent jets on a scale of order the size of a typical bubble .",
    "the turbulence in the fluid amplifies whatever seed fields are present to finite - amplitude large - scale size magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these fields can be considerable , if there is time for equipartition between the kinetic energy associated with the turbulent flow and the magnetic field energy .",
    "a possible mechanism of generation of magnetic seed fields is via the dipole electromagnetic charge layer on the surfaces of the bubbles that forms , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii , as a consequence of baryon asymmetry and the large mass of the top quark .",
    "the burning surfaces of bubbles propagating within a region of turbulent flow rotate in the moving fluid .",
    "the rotation of the dipole charge layer thus sets up a current in the fluid .",
    "we estimate the typical magnetic field generated by a single bubble , and then argue that these fields provide at least one source of seed magnetic fields in the turbulent fluid which are then amplified into full scale magnetic turbulence .",
    "the strength of the fields produced this way are considerably smaller in the absence of magnetic turbulence than the fields that would result from equipartition in the turbulent flow .    in order to estimate the generated magnetic field on scale sizes large compared to the electroweak scale through the cumulative effect of the many bubbles in the system , we follow the classic analysis of hogan @xcite , and determine , in sec .",
    "iv , the magnetic field correlation function , @xmath0 if magnetic fields diffuse up to a scale @xmath1 , then the average magnetic field squared which remains after diffusion will be given in terms of the correlation function by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the spatial average over a volume of size @xmath4 . from this result",
    "we estimate the typical energy in the magnetic field at any time at distance scales greater than the magnetic field diffusion length at that time .",
    "finally we discuss the possible relevance of this work for cosmology . throughout",
    "we use units in which @xmath5 .",
    "the electroweak phase transition appears , within acceptable parameters , to be weakly first order @xcite-@xcite . as the universe cools through the electroweak transition temperature , @xmath6 gev , the plasma in the unbroken phase supercools",
    "; eventually , one assumes , small regions of the broken symmetry phase , with non - zero higgs expectation value , nucleate , forming bubbles which expand and fill the system @xcite-@xcite .    the typical size of a bubble after the phase transition is completed is in the range @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the size of the event horizon at the electroweak scale",
    ", @xmath9 is the planck mass , @xmath10 is the number of massless degrees of freedom in the matter , and the fractional size @xmath11 is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these numbers are typical of parameters characteristic of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the bubble wall surface appears to be stable against small fluctuations @xcite . the bubble wall velocity , while poorly known , should be in the range @xmath13 when @xmath14 , the sound velocity in the symmetric phase of the electroweak plasma , the burning of the symmetric phase proceeds by deflagration in which the phase transition burning front expands out into the symmetric phase .",
    "ahead of the burning front , a supersonic shock moves into the symmetric phase , accelerating it outward , as shown schematically in fig .  1a .",
    "on the other hand , when the bubble wall velocity is supersonic in the symmetric phase , the burning discontinuity generates in its wake a similarity rarefaction wave , with velocity and temperature profiles illustrated in fig .",
    "1b .    as two shock fronts associated with the nucleation bubbles collide , they generate turbulence , shown in fig .",
    "2 . at the point",
    "where the shock fronts intersect , the velocity of the fluid from one bubble is in a different direction than that from the other bubble .",
    "the geometry is similar to the classic problem of the formation of a turbulent jet .",
    "the reynolds number , @xmath15 , of the flow around two colliding bubbles is sufficiently large that we expect fully developed turbulence in a cone associated with the intersection of the two bubbles , whose opening angle depends on the angle of intersection of the two fluids @xcite .",
    "the reynolds number for the collision of two bubbles is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the typical fluid velocity , which we take to be @xmath18 ; the typical size of a bubble , @xmath19 , is given by eq .",
    "( [ bubsize ] ) .",
    "the typical scattering length @xmath20 of excitations in the plasma is of order @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fine structure constant at the electroweak scale , and @xmath23 is the number of degrees of freedom that scatter by electroweak processes @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath24 is sufficiently huge , for any macroscopic size bubble , that the collision of the shocked matter should generate turbulent flow .    a turbulent conducting fluid develops magnetic turbulence , resulting in magnetic fields on all scale sizes .",
    "the relevant time scale for the amplification of fields on length scale @xmath25 is of order @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the duration of the phase transition .",
    "if the field growth is exponential , fields on scales @xmath28 can be amplified by many @xmath29-folds .",
    "when magnetic turbulence becomes fully developed , the kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is equipartitioned with that of the magnetic field energy , implying that the magnetic fields , @xmath30 , generated on the scale of the phase transition bubbles , the largest scale typical of the turbulent flow , are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy density of the electroweak plasma .",
    "since the velocity of the turbulent flow is @xmath33 , a very large fraction of the energy of the fluid is in electromagnetic fields .",
    "turbulent flow is therefore capable of amplifying any seed field by many orders of magnitude .",
    "thermal fluctuations provide a omnipresent source of seed fields whose size can be estimated by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , with the average in eq . ( 1 ) the thermal average for a free photon gas . for scale @xmath34 one",
    "i.e. , for @xmath36 the value of @xmath37 is smaller than the equipartition value by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "let us now compare the magnitude of magnetic fields generated by turbulence with those generated from currents in the bubble walls in the absence of magnetic turbulence .",
    "these currents arise from the electric dipole layer that develops in the bubble wall , as a consequence of the baryon asymmetry of matter undergoing the transition combined with the fact that the mass of the top quark is comparable to the phase transition temperature .",
    "the net baryon number is non - zero in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "if baryogenesis is not associated with the electroweak phase transition , then the local baryon density in the neighborhood of the bubble wall is characterized by a baryon number chemical potential @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the baryon asymmetry is generated at the electroweak phase transition , the asymmetry is driven by cp violating effects and @xmath40 can be much larger .",
    "we take as an acceptable range @xmath41 .",
    "the expectation value of the higgs field goes from zero to a finite value as one traverses the bubble wall into the broken symmetry phase .",
    "thus the top quark has a non - zero mass inside the bubble , and zero mass outside .",
    "top quarks present outside the bubbles face a potential barrier at the bubble wall , which leads to a boltzmann suppression of their number inside the bubble and near the surface .",
    "the slight excess of top over anti - top quarks contributes a net positive charge outside the bubbles , but the charge excess from the tops is suppressed inside .",
    "overall charge neutrality is guaranteed by the presence of a small electrostatic potential , @xmath42 , which is more negative inside the bubble than outside , attracting light positively charged particles to the interior .",
    "the electrostatic potential is determined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total local electric charge .",
    "expanding the distributions of the various charged species to leading order in @xmath42 and the small non - zero charge , baryon and lepton number chemical potentials , and then for simplicity expanding in powers of @xmath45 , we find @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the debye mass for massless leptons and quarks ( including the top ) .",
    "( we neglect a small correction to the debye screening term @xmath48 . )",
    "the debye screening length @xmath49 is of order @xmath50 . in the expected limit where the thickness",
    ", @xmath51 , of the bubble wall is @xmath52 , we solve eqs .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ debye ] ) by expanding in powers of @xmath53 , and find @xmath54 plus corrections involving higher order powers of @xmath55 .",
    "the charge density on the surface , @xmath56 , is of order @xmath57 where the typical baryon asymmetry near the bubble wall is @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 typically @xmath61 10 - 100 , so that @xmath62 . for @xmath63",
    "monotonically decreasing from inside to out across the bubble surface , we see that the bubble has a dipole charge layer of order @xmath64 per unit area .    in order for the dipole charge layer on the bubble wall to generate a magnetic field",
    "the bubble must have a net rotation .",
    "if the bubble is propagating in a turbulent region with vorticity , its surface acquires a net rotational velocity , @xmath65 , of order the typical turbulent velocity in the fluid , @xmath66 . a rotating bubble",
    "thus has associated with it a magnetic moment of order @xmath67 the magnetic field generated by the bubble on a scale size of order the bubble radius is therefore @xmath68 we note that the magnetic field produced by this mechanism is smaller by a factor @xmath69 compared with the field expected from equipartition in a magnetically turbulent environment , eq .",
    "( [ equi ] ) . at the electroweak scale",
    "the equipartition field is @xmath70 gauss , and the field produced from the dipole layers in the bubble walls , @xmath71 gauss , is a factor @xmath72 smaller .",
    "cheng and olinto @xcite , by contrast , find a field produced by the dipole layer in the bubbles at the qcd transition , at @xmath73 100 mev , of order @xmath74 of the equipartition field , @xmath75 gauss .",
    "the reason for their much larger fraction is that they assume that the width of the dipole layer is controlled by the width of the baryon diffusion layer , @xmath76 fm , rather than the microphysics length scale @xmath77 1 fm at the qcd scale .",
    "the diffusion layer for the baryon number is so much larger because the qcd transition occurs sufficiently slowly that the particles have time to undergo many scatterings during the transition . in the electroweak transition on the other hand , the bubble walls move relativistically , and",
    "little diffusion takes place .",
    "we now ask how magnetic fields on scales larger than the electroweak bubble size are generated by superposition of the fields associated with the turbulent flow .",
    "a first estimate can be made by assuming that the magnetic fields on scales large compared with the size of the turbulent velocity fields are generated by randomly oriented magnetic dipoles of typical size that of this velocity field .",
    "a magnetic dipole @xmath78 generates a magnetic field far from the dipole of order @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the position of the dipole .",
    "near the dipole the field saturates to a more or less constant value . to estimate the net magnetic fields produced by randomly oriented dipoles",
    ", we make a continuum approximation for the distribution of dipoles , and assume that the density @xmath81 of dipoles pointing in the @xmath82th direction is gaussianly distributed with measure @xmath83\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\kappa}\\int d^3r\\ ,    { \\vec\\nu}^2({\\bf r})\\right\\ } , \\label{dipdistr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is a constant .",
    "the correlation function of the density of dipoles implied by the distribution ( [ dipdistr ] ) is @xmath85 from eqs .",
    "( [ bdip ] ) and ( [ dipcor ] ) we thus find the magnetic field - magnetic field correlation function @xmath86 this integral representation is dominated by the regions where either @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the integral in these regions is cut off by the size of the typical dipole , @xmath89 , so that for @xmath90 , @xmath91    the average strength of @xmath92 measured by averaging on a size scale @xmath1 is thus . ]",
    "@xmath93 if we assume equipartition , and compare with eq .",
    "( [ equi ] ) , we see that @xmath84 is given by @xmath94 and therefore @xmath95    the expansion of the universe causes the magnetic field to decrease as the square of scale factor of the universe .",
    "therefore , in the absence of flux diffusion , the ratio of @xmath96 to the energy @xmath97 in photons , @xmath98 remains independent of time , when measured on a comoving scale size . from ( [ b2 ] ) we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the size of the universe at the electroweak phase transition times the scale factor , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the temperature of the microwave background ; at the present epoch @xmath103 au .    magnetic fields from the electroweak transition can survive only on scales on which magnetic diffusion has not had time to wash out the field correlations .",
    "the flux diffusion equation , which in the local fluid rest frame can be written as , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the electrical conductivity , implies that a magnetic field of length scale @xmath106 dies off on a time scale @xmath107 long wavelength magnetic fields set up at the electroweak phase transition die away very slowly .",
    "the characteristic diffusion distance at time @xmath108 is therefore of order @xmath109 at @xmath108 magnetic fields on length scales larger than @xmath110 are not yet significantly affected by diffusion .",
    "an upper limit on the diffusion length is its present value , about 3 au @xcite which is not much smaller than the size of the horizon at the electroweak phase transition .    in the present epoch , @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "thus the equipartition magnetic field on a scale of order of diffusion length in the extragalactic medium is now about @xmath113 gauss .",
    "these fields might have acted in an earlier epoch as seed fields , subsequently ampified by a galactic dynamo mechanism to produce the galactic magnetic fields . on a galactic size scale , at present seven orders of magnitude larger than the present size of the electroweak horizon , one finds that the equipartition field is @xmath114 gauss .",
