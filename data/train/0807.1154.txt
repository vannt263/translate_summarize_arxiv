    "parton distributions play an important role in the qcd description of hard scattering processes . in particular ,",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) have extensively been studied during the last decade .",
    "we focus here on the most general form of quark - quark correlation functions , the so - called generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( gtmds ) .",
    "these gtmds are connected to the so - called wigner distributions of the hadron - parton system  @xcite and contain the gpds and tmds in certain limits . very recently",
    "a first complete analysis of these interesting objects has been performed , that was , however , restricted to the special case of spin-0 hadrons  @xcite .",
    "in this short note  @xcite we will extend the analysis to the case of spin-1/2 hadrons and give a brief overview of the main applications for nucleon gtmds .",
    "we start by recalling some definitions , that will be needed later on .",

    "the gpds depend on three kinematical variables : the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath5 of the parton , the skewness parameter @xmath6 , and the momentum transfer @xmath7 .",
    "for the nucleon tmds we also use the common definition by the correlator @xmath8}(x , \\vec{k}_t )   = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\ ! \\frac{d z^-}{2\\pi } \\ , \\frac{d^2 \\vec{z}_t}{(2\\pi)^2 } \\ , e^{ik   \\cdot z } \\ ,     \\big < p , \\lambda ' \\big| \\ , \\bar{\\psi}\\big(\\!-\\!\\tfrac{1}{2}z\\big ) \\ ,     \\gamma \\ , \\mathcal{w}_\\text{tmd } \\ ,     \\psi\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}z\\big ) \\ , \\big| p , \\lambda \\big > \\ , \\big|_{z^+=0 } \\ , .",

    "by examining the correlators of gpds  ( [ eq : corr_gpd ] ) and tmds  ( [ eq : corr_tmd ] ) one immediately finds that they both look very similar .",
    "therefore , it is evident to ask , whether it is possible to study a more general correlator , that contains both in some limits .",
    "of course this correlator is given by the canonical extension of the correlators  ( [ eq : corr_gpd ] ) and  ( [ eq : corr_tmd ] ) to the most general quark - quark correlator of the nucleon @xmath14}(x , \\xi , \\vec{k}_t , \\vec{\\delta}_t )   = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\ !",

    "( [ eq : corr_gpd ] ) and @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr_tmd ] ) in the limits above .",
    "the wilson lines are necessary in order to ensure color gauge invariance of the correlators  ( [ eq : corr_gpd ] ) , ( [ eq : corr_tmd ] ) , and ( [ eq : corr_gtmd ] ) . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the path @xmath19 or in other words to pure future - pointing ( @xmath20 ) and past - pointing ( @xmath21 ) wilson lines .",
    "this introduces an additional dependence on @xmath22 , that has been suppressed so far .",
    "the parton distributions , which are defined by the most general quark - quark correlator of the nucleon  ( [ eq : corr_gtmd ] ) , are the so - called generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution ( gtmds ) .",
    "these gtmds may be of importance for the phenomenology of hard exclusive reactions .",
    "it is already known , for instance , that gluon gtmds enter the description of diffractive vector meson  @xcite and higgs production  @xcite even at leading twist .",
    "the parameterization of the correlator  ( [ eq : corr_gtmd ] ) can be performed by applying parity , hermiticity , and time - reversal .",
    "analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the case of a spin-0 hadron has been discussed , this yields some constraints .",
    "it follows for example that the parity constraint reduces the number of independent terms in the correlator  ( [ eq : corr_gtmd ] ) significantly .",
    "taking again @xmath1 one obtains four complex valued gtmds , @xmath23}_{\\lambda\\lambda'}(x , \\xi , \\vec{k}_t , \\vec{\\delta}_t ; \\eta ) = \\ ,   & \\frac{1}{2 m } \\",

    ", u(p , \\lambda ) \\ , ,   \\label{eq : def_gtmd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24",
    ". in addition , the hermiticity constraint implies @xmath25 where the plus sign holds for @xmath26 and the minus sign for @xmath27 .",
    "finally , the time - reversal constraint allows one to split each gtmd into two real valued functions , @xmath28 the so - called t - even and t - odd part of the gtmd , which can be distinguished by a different dependence on @xmath29 . while the t - even part @xmath30 is independent of @xmath29 the t - odd part @xmath31 changes its sign under @xmath32 .",
    "as the correlator of gtmds  ( [ eq : corr_gtmd ] ) contains the correlators of gpds  ( [ eq : corr_gpd ] ) and tmds  ( [ eq : corr_tmd ] ) in the limits  ( [ eq : lim_gpd ] ) and  ( [ eq : lim_tmd ] ) , gtmds can be considered as the mother distributions of gpds and tmds .",
    "therefore , one should be able to obtain the parameterization of gpds in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_gpd ] ) and of tmds in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_tmd ] ) directly from the parameterization of the gtmds in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_gtmd ] ) .",
    "this is indeed possible and one finds for the gpds @xmath33 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : lim1_gpd } \\\\",

    ", f_{1,2}^e     + f_{1,3}^e    \\bigg )   \\bigg ] \\ , ,   \\label{eq : lim2_gpd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 and for the tmds @xmath35 consequently , a complete parameterization of all gtmds immediately yields a complete parameterization of all gpds and tmds .",
    "we have performed such a parameterization of the correlator  ( [ eq : corr_gtmd ] ) to all twists and found a total of 64 complex valued gtmds for the nucleon , which can be split into 64 real valued t - even and 64 real valued t - odd parts . in addition we also studied the limits of gpds and tmds and found that in both cases 32 real valued functions survive ( see tab .",

    "our result is in perfect agreement with earlier works  @xcite .",
    "another interesting application for the gtmds is the test of possible nontrivial relations between gpds and tmds .",
    "such relations can be established in model calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , but so far no model - independent proof has been found .",
    "the most prominent example of a possible nontrivial relation between gpds and tmds is probably the relation between the gpd @xmath36 and the sivers function @xmath37 , which reads @xmath38 in impact parameter space  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath39 denotes the fourier - transformed gpd @xmath36 and @xmath40 the so - called lensing function .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lim2_gpd ] ) and  ( [ eq : lim2_tmd ] ) it is obvious that the nontrivial relation  ( [ eq : nt_rel ] ) can not hold in general as the involved gpd and tmd have different mother distributions .",
    "the same applies to all other nontrivial relations discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , also to the one between the gpd @xmath41 and the pretzelocity distribution @xmath42 .",
    "in summary we have performed the first complete parameterization of the most general quark - quark correlator of the nucleon in terms of gtmds , which can be considered as the mother distributions of gpds and tmds . as a by - product",
    "we also obtained the first complete parameterization of the nucleon gpds and tmds to all twists .",
    "this allowed us to perform a model - independent test of possible nontrivial relations between gpds and tmds , which can be established in model calculations .",
    "our results indicate , that no such nontrivial relations exist as the involved gpd and tmd have different mother distributions .",
