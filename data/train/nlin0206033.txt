    "in recent years , the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) has emerged as an alternative tool for the computational fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "originally , the lbm was developed as a modification of the lattice gas model @xcite .",
    "later derivations @xcite revealed that the method is a special discretiszation of the continuous boltzmann equation .",
    "the derivation of the lbm @xcite from the boltzmann equation is essentially based on grad s moment method @xcite , together with the gauss - hermite quadrature in the velocity space .",
    "another important issue was to retain positivity of discrete velocities populations in the bulk .",
    "recently , a progress has been achieved in incorporating the @xmath0theorem into the method @xcite , and thus retaining positivity of the populations in the bulk . on the contrary , despite of several attempts @xcite a fully consistent theory of the boundary condition for the method is still lacking .",
    "it appears that the concerns about positivity of the population , and the connection with the continuous case , are somewhat ignored while introducing the boundary condition .",
    "the way the no  slip condition for the moving wall is incorporated in the method @xcite is especially prone to danger of loss of positivity of the populations at the boundary .",
    "a clear understanding of the boundary condition becomes demanding for the case of moving boundary , complicated geometries , chemically reactive or porous walls .",
    "the theory of boundary conditions for the continuous boltzmann equation is sufficiently well developed to incorporate the information about the structure and the chemical processes on the wall @xcite .",
    "the realization that the lbm is a special discretization of the boltzmann equation allows to derive the boundary conditions for the lbm from continuous kinetic theory . in this work",
    "we demonstrate how this can be done in a systematic way .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec:1 ] we give a brief description of the lbm . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly describe how boundary condition is formulated for the continuous kinetic theory . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we derive the boundary condition for the lbm and in section [ sec:4 ] we demonstrate some numerical simulation to validate the result .",
    "in the lbm setup , one considers populations @xmath1 of discrete velocities @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , at discrete time @xmath4 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath5-dimensional population vectors @xmath6 .    in the isothermal case considered below ,",
    "local hydrodynamic variables are given as , @xmath7    the basic equation to be solved is @xmath8    { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\delta$}}_i[{\\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}}(\\mathbf{r},t)],\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is a fixed parameter in the interval @xmath10 $ ] and is related to the viscosity .",
    "a scalar function of the population vector @xmath11 is the nontrivial root of the nonlinear equation @xmath12).\\ ] ] the function @xmath11 ensures the discrete - time @xmath0theorem . in the previous derivations @xcite of the lbm from the boltzmann equation , a quadratic form for the equilibrium distribution function @xmath13 , was obtained by evaluating the taylor series expansion of the absolute maxwellian equilibrium on the nodes of a properly selected quadrature .",
    "this was done to ensure that the navier - stokes equation is reproduced up to the order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mach number .",
    "however , the disadvantage of expanding equilibrium distribution function is that the condition of monotonicity of the entropy production is not guaranteed . in order to avoid this problem , in the entropic formulation @xcite",
    ", the boltzmann @xmath0 function , rather than the equilibrium distribution , is evaluated at the nodes of the given quadrature , to get the discrete version of the @xmath0function as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the weight associated with the corresponding quadrature node @xmath2 . in the appendix [ app:1 ] ,",
    "the derivation of the @xmath0function is presented .",
    "afterwards , the collision term is constructed from the knowledge of the @xmath0function ( eq.([result9 ] ) ) .",
    "the collision term @xmath18 is constructed in such a way that it satisfies a set of admissibility conditions needed to have a proper @xmath0theorem and conservation laws ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    the lbm model with the bgk collision form @xcite , can be considered as a limiting case of the entropic formulation . to obtain the lattice bgk equation , the function @xmath11 in the eq .",
    "( [ lbm ] ) is set equals to @xmath19 , and for the collision term @xmath18 bgk form is chosen . the equilibrium function used in the bgk form",
    "is obtained as the minimizer of the @xmath0function ( eq.([result9 ] ) ) subjected to the hydrodynamic constrains ( eq.([hyd ] ) ) , evaluated up to the order @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "derivation of the boundary conditions done in the subsequent section applies to both the forms of the lbm .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we briefly outline how boundary condition is formulated in the continuous kinetic theory .",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to the case where the mass flux through the wall is zero .",
    "for the present purpose , a wall @xmath21 is completely specified at any point @xmath22 by the knowledge of the inward unit normal @xmath23 , the wall temperature @xmath24 and the wall velocity @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter , we shall denote the distribution function in a frame of reference moving with the wall velocity as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution function reflected from the non  adsorbing wall can be written explicitly , if the scattering probability is known . in explicit form , @xmath28 where the non  negative function @xmath29 denotes the scattering probability from the direction @xmath30 to the direction @xmath31 . if the wall is non - porous and non - adsorbing , the total probability for an impinging particle to be re  emitted is unity : @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ probc ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) ensure that the reflected distribution functions are positive and the normal flux through the wall is zero .",
    "a further restriction on the form of function @xmath33 is dictated by the condition of detailed balance @xcite , @xmath34 a consequence of this property is that , if the impinging distributions are wall ",
    "maxwellian , then the reflected distributions are also wall  maxwellian . thus , @xmath35 this equation can also be understood as a weaker statement of the detailed balance condition @xcite .",
    "this form of the detailed balance is very attractive for our present purpose because of its integral nature , so that a discretization can be done in a natural way .    in this paper",
    ", we only consider the diffusive boundary conditions because the steps associated with the discretization are easier to appreciate due to the mathematical simplicity in this case . in this model of the wall",
    "it is assumed that the out  going stream has completely lost its memory about the incoming stream .",
    "thus , the scattering probability @xmath33 is independent of the impinging directions , and is equals to @xmath36 thus , the explicit expression for the reflected distribution function is @xmath37    we need to transform this equation into the stationary co  ordinate system . as the equilibrium distribution depends only on the difference between the particle velocity and the local velocity , we have    @xmath38    in the next section , we will show how the discretization of the equation ( [ cbc ] ) can be performed .",
    "in the derivation of the lattice boltzmann equation for the bulk various integrals , which are evaluated at the nodes of a gauss  hermite quadrature , @xcite are of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spatial dimension .",
    "this form of the integral is well approximated by the gauss ",
    "hermite quadrature . however , the situation is different on the boundary because integrals appearing in eq .",
    "( [ cbc ] ) are over half  space .",
    "the choice of the quadrature in the bulk was based on the properties of integrals in the @xmath41 . if we would evaluate the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ cbc ] ) using a quadrature defined in the half  space , this may introduce an undesirable mismatch of the nodes of the quadrature used on the boundary and that in the bulk .",
    "thus , we here apply the quadrature used in the bulk even for the boundary nodes .",
    "next , we shall estimate the extra error introduced by this procedure in comparison to the discretization error present in the bulk .",
    "the discrete distribution function used in the lbm is the projection of the continuous distribution function in a finite dimensional orthonormal hermite basis @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium also need to be projected in this basis to have correct conservation laws .",
    "this solution has a major drawback that the positivity of the distribution function is lost in the truncation .",
    "this problem is circumvented , if we evaluate the boltzmann @xmath0function , rather than its minimizer under the constrains of conservation of the hydrodynamic variables , for the discrete case .",
    "indeed , the local equilibrium can also be written as @xmath42 where @xmath11 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the lagrange multipliers needed for the minimization of the boltzmann @xmath0function under the constrains of conservation of the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "these lagrange multipliers are calculated from the requirement that the moments of the equilibrium distribution @xmath45 are known hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "now , once we have evaluated the projection of the boltzmann @xmath0function on a finite dimensional hermite basis , we calculate the equilibrium from the knowledge of the discrete @xmath0function .",
    "it turns out that the equilibrium corresponding to the discrete @xmath0function also has the same functional form as eq .",
    "( [ eqg ] ) .",
    "only difference is that the lagrange multipliers has to be calculated from the discrete conservation laws .",
    "one example of explicit form of such equilibrium distribution function is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    first projecting the distribution functions in the hermite basis and then evaluating the integrals appearing in eq .",
    "( [ cbc ] ) by quadrature , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the rescaled distribution function evaluated at nodes of the quadrature .",
    "this rescaled distribution function is the distribution function used in the lbm @xcite .",
    "the discrete equilibrium distribution function @xmath48 is the projection of the equilibrium distribution on the finite dimensional hermite basis and calculated by the procedure discussed above . before estimating error associated with this formula , a few remark about",
    "the preceding equation is in order .",
    "first , in the isothermal case the wall temperature is a redundant quantity and is dropped from the argument of equilibrium distribution . to get a boundary condition for the lattice bgk equation , the true discrete equilibrium appearing in the eq .",
    "( [ dbc ] ) can be replaced by the equilibrium used in the bgk model @xcite .",
    "this substitution is justified because up to order @xmath14 the true equilibrium can be replaced by the bgk equilibrium .",
    "however , positivity of the reflected distributions may be lost in this truncation in the same way it happens in the bulk for lattice bgk model .",
    "a similar expression for the boundary conditions was earlier postulated by gatingnol in the context of discrete velocity models of the kinetic theory @xcite .    in order to estimate the extra error introduced on the boundary in comparison to the bulk",
    ", we write the ratio of two integrals appearing in the eq.([cbc ] ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "as discussed above , the evaluation of the integral appearing in the denominator is straightforward in the sense that the order of accuracy of this evaluation is same as that of moments evaluation in the bulk . in order to evaluate the integral appearing in the numerator",
    ", we perform hermite expansion of the non  equilibrium part of the distribution function around the zero velocity equilibrium .",
    "the result is    @xmath51    the first two expansion coefficients of the non  equilibrium part of the population are @xmath52 ) . in case of the isothermal hydrodynamics ,",
    "zero hermite coefficient needs to be kept is @xmath53 .",
    "this is a symmetric tensor and is independent of the particle velocity @xmath54 . after using the symmetry of the second order hermite ",
    "polynomials , @xmath55 this expression can be evaluated using the gauss ",
    "hermite quadrature .",
    "the result is @xmath56 this expression gives an estimate of the order of the accuracy of the eq.([dbc ] ) . in evaluation of the moments ( up to the second order moment ) of the distribution function ,",
    "no extra error is introduced as compared to the bulk .",
    "this happened because first odd order hermite coefficient appearing in the expansion is zero .",
    "due to the expansion around global equilibrium , used in the derivation , the boundary condition is valid only up to the order @xmath14 .",
    "now , for purely diffusive scattering , we have a closed form expression for the reflected populations with the same order of accuracy as the bulk node .",
    "however , we have said nothing about the grazing directions .",
    "unlike continuous kinetic theory , here we need to specify the conditions in the grazing directions . only information we have about the grazing populations is their positivity .",
    "a simple way to fixed the grazing population is to let them evolve according to the lattice ",
    "boltzmann equation like nodes in the bulk region .",
    "this condition is implemented in the simulations presented in the next section .",
    "the boundary condition derived in the previous section ( eq .",
    "( [ dbc ] ) ) , retains one important feature of original boltzmann equation , the knudsen number dependent slip at the wall . to show this , we have performed a numerical simulation of the kramers problem @xcite",
    "this is one of the few problem where solution of the continuous boltzmann equation is known analytically .",
    "this problem is a limiting case of the plane couette flow , where one of the plate is moved to infinity , while keeping a fixed shear rate .",
    "we compare the analytical solution for the slip  velocity at the wall calculated for the linearized bgk collision model with the numerical solution in the fig .",
    "we have performed the numerical computation for the d2q9 lattice with the entropic formulation of the lbm @xcite with the expression of the @xmath0 function given by eq .",
    "( [ app : h ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the two result for knudsen number going to zero is very good .",
    "this is indeed an important result as it shows that with the proper implementation of the boundary condition , the solution of the lbm converge to the hydrodynamic limit ( knudsen number going to zero ) in the same way as the boltzmann equation .    by simulating the kramer s problem ,",
    "we have shown that the present boundary condition can be used for stationary wall . to validate the boundary condition for the moving wall , we have performed simulation of the lid  driven cavity flow .",
    "the plot of stream  function is given in fig.[fig2 ] for reynolds number @xmath57 .",
    "the location of the primary and secondary vortex and the magnitude of the stream  functions agrees well with the previous simulations @xcite .",
    "once we have shown that the diffusive boundary condition used for the continuous boltzmann equation can be reformulated for the discrete case , the question arises that , can this procedure be applied for a more sophisticated scattering kernels used in the continuous kinetic theory ( see for examples ref .",
    "the answer is in affirmative for any condition written in the integral form , while in general it can not be done for a point - wise condition like purely specular reflection .",
    "for example , a very general form of scattering probability , written in the integral form and can be easily modified for nonzero mass flux , is given in the ref .",
    "@xcite ( see eq.(@xmath58 ) of the chapter @xmath59 ) .",
    "this form of the scattering probability can be discretized using the present method .",
    "it is instructive to compare the ` bounce  back ' condition used in the literature with the present boundary condition .",
    "it can be seen easily that the present boundary condition reduces to the bounce ",
    "back condition for the three velocity model used in the one  dimensional case . however , there is no correspondence between the two condition in the higher dimensions .",
    "the present boundary condition retains the positivity at the boundary nodes .",
    "this is a major advantage in comparison to other proposed boundary conditions for the purpose of the numerical stability .",
    "the knudsen number dependent wall slip is a manifestation of the kinetic nature of the lattice boltzmann equation .",
    "this nature of the scheme can be a burden if one is interested in solving the macroscopic creeping flow problems with very small grid size .",
    "this will put some restriction on the simulation of creeping flow in very small grids ( lattice knudsen number @xmath60 ) .",
    "however , the restriction is not severe because of the fact that we still have the freedom to choose velocity very small to attain zero reynolds number situation .",
    "in fact , the same condition is required for the validity of the lbm simulation of the hydrodynamics in the bulk . to conclude , we have proposed boundary conditions based on the kinetic theory considerations .",
    "a systematic way of dealing with the conditions at the boundary is developed for the lattice ",
    "boltzmann method .",
    "the present work opens the way to the future development for the cases of reactive , porous or adsorbing walls .",
    "we thank professor hans christian ttinger for the useful discussions .",
    "the boltzmann @xmath0function is @xmath61 this expression written in terms of the logarithm of the distribution function @xmath62 is @xmath63 we have chosen to work with the variable @xmath64 because the projection of it on to the hermite basis preserves positivity of the distribution function @xmath65 .",
    "the expansion of the function @xmath64 is @xmath66 this expression can also be written as , @xmath67    the expansion coefficients @xmath68 is calculated by the requirement that the moments of @xmath69 are hydrodynamic variables . the expansion used here is a slightly different form of the grad s moment expansion @xcite and is known as the maximum entropy approximation @xcite .",
    "now , the boltzmann @xmath0 function is in a integral form suited for the evaluation in the gauss ",
    "hermite quadrature ( see eq .",
    "( [ ghq ] ) ) .",
    "this evaluation gives the discrete form of the @xmath0 function as @xmath70 where , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the reference temperature .",
    "in @xmath19dimension , the nodes of the quadrature and the corresponding weights are @xmath73 and      here the magnitude of the discrete velocity @xmath75 is related to the reference temperature by the relation @xmath76 . with this , the entropy expression derived here coincide with the expression derived in ref .",
