    "<S> is also established . </S>",
    "<S> the separation condition is shown to be necessary for such results to hold . in the end </S>",
    "<S> we show that every sufficiently large point set in @xmath6 contains an arbitrarily large subset of almost collinear points . </S>",
    "<S> no separation condition is needed in this case .    * keywords * : euclidean ramsey theory , approximate arithmetic progression , approximate homothetic copy , almost collinear points . </S>"
