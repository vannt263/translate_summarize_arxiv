    "analytical models of parsec  scale jets , although being contested ever stronger by numerical simulations , still provide a valuable means for describing observational data , particularly when different aspects of the jet physics ( such as its spectral and kinematic properties ) are combined together in a single formulation , providing additional constraints and checks for the model parameters . in this contribution",
    ", we discuss how the well  established shock  in  jet model ( `` shock model '' hereafter ; see marscher 1990 , marscher , gear , & travis 1991 , for detailed discussions of the model ) can be reinforced by inclusion of kinematic information available from vlbi observations .",
    "in its most common formulation , the shock model predicts changes of the turnover frequency , @xmath0 , and flux density , @xmath1 , in the spectrum of radio emission associated with a shock .",
    "the jet is usually assumed to have a constant opening angle , @xmath2 , so that the shock transverse dimension is proportional to the distance , @xmath3 , at which the shock is located .",
    "other model parameters are expressed as functions of @xmath3 : the magnetic field @xmath4 , doppler factor @xmath5 , and number density @xmath6 ( for a power  law electron energy distribution , @xmath7 ) . the shock emission is dominated subsequently by compton , synchrotron and adiabatic losses . at each stage ,",
    "the predicted quantities are described by the following proportionalities : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( for complete evaluations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , see marscher 1990 , lobanov & zensus 1999 ) .",
    "below , we describe how estimates of the power index @xmath14 can be obtained from vlbi data , and give examples of applying this approach to studying compact variable radio sources .",
    "single dish observations yield light curves @xmath15 at different frequencies , which can be used to determine the evolution of spectral turnover ( @xmath16 ) , provided an adequate frequency coverage and time sampling .",
    "vlbi monitoring programs allow to measure relative proper motions , @xmath17 , and ( in exceptional cases ) also spectral changes of enhanced emission regions detected in parsec  scale jets . from the measured @xmath18 ,",
    "the jet apparent speeds , @xmath19 , and doppler factors , @xmath20 , can be reconstructed , with necessary assumptions made about the jet kinematics . in the simplest case , the jet lorentz factor , @xmath21 ,",
    "can be taken constant , and @xmath20 is then described by changes of the jet viewing angle , @xmath22 . for more complicated cases , @xmath23^{0.5}$ ] can be assumed , or even complete kinematic settings can be postulated ( e.g. a helical trajectory , as has been done , for instance , by roland et al .",
    "once the form of @xmath20 has been determined , we can evaluate @xmath24 .",
    "since variations of @xmath20 are not necessarily monotonic , we resort to determining @xmath24 locally , so that @xmath25}{\\log[r(t+dt)/r(t)]}\\ ] ] we then select a timerange , ( @xmath26 ) , during which the changes of @xmath24 are small enough to approximate @xmath27 . fitting the observed spectral turnover data",
    ", we can obtain the turnover points at the respective epochs , and evaluate the absolute location of the shock at the epoch @xmath28 : @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 . repeating this step as many times as necessary",
    ", we can reconstruct the entire kinematic evolution of the shock .",
    "the procedure can also be reversed : we can first fit the shock model to the spectral data , and determine values of @xmath14 for different time periods .",
    "we then use equation ( 2 ) to calculate the respective locations of the shock at different epochs , and compare these locations with the locations and speeds inferred from vlbi data .",
    "if we fix the kinematic settings and assume that the shocked feature moves at a speed @xmath32 along a helical path with amplitude , @xmath33 , frequency , @xmath34 , and parallel wavenumber , @xmath35 , we can reconstruct the time evolution of the shock location : @xmath36^{1/2 } }   dr \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath37 ^ 2 + 1 $ ] and @xmath38 .",
    "the form of @xmath33 may differ , depending on the choice of the jet geometry .",
    "we use @xmath39 , corresponding to a jet with opening half ",
    "angle approaching @xmath40 $ ] , for @xmath41 .",
    "the obtained @xmath42 can be then checked against @xmath24 inferred from the shock model , or used for predicting the light curves directly .",
    "we show here two examples of applying the method outlined above to radio observations of blazars .",
    "a short - timescale flare in october 1992 was monitored with the vla at 1.4 , 4.8 , and 8.4ghz ( kraus , quirrenbach , lobanov , et  al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the observed light curves show that the emission first peaks at 1.4 ghz , and later nearly simultaneously at 4.8 and 8.4ghz .",
    "a cross correlation function analysis yields the respective time lags @xmath43days , @xmath44days , and @xmath45days .",
    "the flare duration becomes progressively longer at higher frequencies , making this event rather peculiar .",
    "the modified lightcurves obtained after subtraction of the underlying emission are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "we discuss elsewhere ( kraus et al .",
    "1999 ) several possible schemes capable of explaining the observed peculiarities .",
    "one of our proposed schemes uses a precessing electron  positron beam ( see roland et al . 1994 ) with a period @xmath46days and precession angle @xmath47 .",
    "the kinematics of such a beam is then given by equation ( 3 ) , with @xmath48pc and @xmath49pc .",
    "the resulting doppler factors vary with time , reproducing the observed lags between the peaks in the lightcurves . for time lags to be present during a flare , the turnover frequency in the observer s frame should be within the range of observing frequencies . in 0235 + 164 , we can satisfy this condition by postulating a homogeneous synchrotron spectrum with spectral index @xmath50 and rest frame turnover frequency @xmath51ghz .",
    "additional spectral evolution may be required to remove the apparent discrepancy between the model and observed amplitudes and widths of the flares .",
    "we have studied ( lobanov & zensus 1999 ) spectral changes in the core and several jet components in 3c345 , based on the data from a vlbi monitoring of the source . in the example shown in figure  [ fig-2 ] , we use the observed trajectory ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) of the jet component c5 to confront a fit by the shock model to the variations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) . in the right panel ,",
    "the solid line shows a fit by the shock model , without taking into account the observed kinematics of c5 .",
    "when we require the shock model to reproduce @xmath24 needed to satisfy the observed path of c5 , the fit becomes problematic , at later stages of the shock evolution .",
    "this indicates that , at distances @xmath52mas , the shock may have dissipated , and other processes become main contributors to the emission from c5 .",
    "incidentally , the kinematic and emission properties of other jet features also show evidence for a change in the emission properties , at distances of 11.5mas from the vlbi core of 3c345 ( lobanov & zensus ) .",
