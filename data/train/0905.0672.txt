    "as is well known , there is mounting observational evidence that our universe is presently dominated by two exotic forms of matter or energy .",
    "cold , nonbaryonic dark matter ( cdm ) , which accounts for @xmath5 of the critical mass density and whose leading particle candidates are the axions and the supersymmetric charginos and neutralinos , was originally proposed to explain the general behavior of galactic rotation curves that differ significantly from the one predicted by newtonian mechanics .",
    "later on , it was also realized that the same concept is necessary for explaining the evolution of the observed structure in the universe from density inhomogeneities of the size detected by a number of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments .",
    "dark energy or quintessence , which accounts for @xmath6 of the critical mass density and whose leading candidates are a cosmological constant @xmath7 and a relic scalar field @xmath8 , has been inferred from a combination of astronomical observations which includes distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) indicating that the expansion of the universe is speeding up , cmb anisotropy data suggesting @xmath9 , and clustering estimates providing @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for current reviews ) .",
    "another interesting aspect related to these two dark components is that , unless some unknown symmetry in nature prevents or suppresses a non - minimal coupling between them ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , the dark matter and dark energy fields may interact between themselves , giving rise to the so - called models of coupled quintessence ( see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . from the observational side ,",
    "no piece of evidence has been so far unambiguously presented against such an interaction , so that a weak coupling still below detection can not be completely excluded . in the cosmological context ,",
    "models of coupled quintessence are capable of explaining the current cosmic acceleration , as well as other recent observational results @xcite . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "however , critiques to these scenarios do exist and are mainly related to the fact that in order to establish a model and study its cosmological consequences , one needs first to specify a phenomenological coupling @xmath11 between the cosmic components .    in this paper , instead of adopting the traditional approach , we follow the qualitative arguments used in refs .  @xcite and deduce the interacting law from a simple argument about the effect of the dark energy decay on the dark matter expansion rate . as a step towards fundamental physics motivation for this phenomenological dark matter / dark energy interaction ,",
    "we study how this class of coupled cosmologies can be interpreted in terms of classical scalar field dynamics .",
    "we also discuss current observational constrains on the interacting term @xmath0 . to this end",
    "we use two different samples of sne ia data , namely , the snls collaboration sample of 115 data points @xcite and the most recent sne ia compilation , the so - called _ constitution set _ of 397 sne ia covering a redshift range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xcite . given the complementarity of sne ia data with other cosmological observables , a joint analysis with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak at @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite , and measurements of the hubble evolution @xmath3  @xcite is also performed .    0.1 in",
    "if dark energy and dark matter interacts , the energy density of this latter component will dilute at a different rate compared to its standard evolution , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "thus , the deviation from the standard dilution may be characterized by a constant @xmath0 , such that @xmath16 where we have set the present - day value of the cosmological scale factor @xmath17 . by assuming that the radiation and baryonic fluids are separately conserved , the energy conservation law for the two interacting components reads @xmath18 , where @xmath19 or , equivalently ( in our notation , @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 by combining the above equations and considering that the dark energy component is described by an equation of state parameter @xmath22",
    ", one can show that the energy density of the dark energy component evolves as @xcite @xmath23 where the integration constant @xmath24 is the present - day fraction of the dark energy density .",
    "clearly , in the absence of a coupling with the cdm component , i.e. , @xmath25 , the conventional non - interacting quintessence scenario is fully recovered . for @xmath4 and @xmath26",
    ", we may identify @xmath27 ( the current value of the vacuum contribution ) , and the above expression reduces to the vacuum decaying scenario recently discussed in refs .",

    "it is shown that this fraction is a very sensitive function of the interacting parameter @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath31 , the dark energy contribution relative to @xmath32 for @xmath33 is about 75% larger than the same contribution for @xmath34 .",
    "this amounts to saying that for relatively large and positive values of @xmath0 the energy density of the pressureless component is not negligible at high-@xmath35 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the @xmath7cdm case ( @xmath25 and @xmath4 ) is also shown ( solid line ) .",
    "in order to find the scalar field counterpart for the flat interacting dark matter / energy model considered here ( that shares the same dynamics and temperature evolution law ) , we use the procedure originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for a general description with arbitrary curvature ) .",

    "we have discussed some cosmological consequences of an alternative mechanism of cosmic acceleration based on a general class of coupled quintessence scenarios whose interaction term is deduced from the effect of the dark energy on the cdm expansion rate .",
    "the resulting expressions for the model are parameterized by a small parameter @xmath0 and have many of the previous phenomenological approaches as a particular case .    following the procedure proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have also discussed a scalar field description for these cosmologies and found that this class of models is identified with a coupled quintessence field with the potential given by eqs .",

    "we have shown that negative and positive values for the interacting parameter @xmath0 are observationally allowed , which means that both an energy flow from dark energy to dark matter as well as a flow from dark matter to dark energy are possible .",
