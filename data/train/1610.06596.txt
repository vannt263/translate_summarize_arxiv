    "we expect at least this modification to the entropy for several possible @xmath0 distributions .",
    "the usual h - theorem is established for the @xmath1 function defined as @xmath32 the essential of this theorem is to ensure that for any initial state , a gas that satisfies boltzmann equation approach to a local equilibrium state , which means @xmath13 .",

    "the extensivity property is broken by these new terms .",
    "we notice that the sackur - tetrode expression for the entropy of the ideal gas @xmath47 can be recovered by an ad - hoc fixing term as it was originally proposed by gibbs .    with the knowledge of the entropy as a function of volume and temperature it is possible to calculate some of the response functions for the system    @xmath48    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the thermal expansion coefficient and @xmath51 is the isothermal compressibility . for an ideal gas @xmath52 , @xmath53 , therefore , using the equation of state @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath56 is the number of moles .",

    "high densities could be achieved with very small volumes ( for fixed @xmath10 ) , i.e. , for confined systems .",
    "+        it is a well known thermodynamic result that an equation of state ( pressure as a function of volume and temperature ) can be obtained if the response functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given @xmath61 in terms of the new variables @xmath62 the change in pressure can be written as @xmath63 and the response functions @xmath64 must be expressed in terms of @xmath65 .",

    "_ in continuous and dashed lines for @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively.@xcite ]    in order to explore the consequences of redefining the distribution probability using a generalized statistics , we performed canonical ensemble monte carlo computer simulations for a fluid composed of spherical particles interacting via two different models , square - well ( sw ) and lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials . in the first case we considered @xmath79 particles of diameter @xmath69 interacting via a sw pair potential with an attractive range @xmath80 and energy - depth @xmath70 ; for the second model we used @xmath81 particles",

    "in all the cases we observe that the generalized probability introduces an effective repulsive interaction . the effect on the thermodynamic properties is equivalent to increase the repulsive force between molecules and there is a reduction on the values for the internal energy . for the case of the heat capacity",
    "the effects of modifying the probability are more noticeable near the critical density or at higher densities where clearly the gp values of @xmath86 are greater for the boltzmann - gibbs statistics .",
    "the procedure to define an effective potential @xmath87 is by assuming that the generalized boltzmann factor in equation ( 4 ) can be mapped onto a classical boltzmann factor , @xmath88    an interesting consequence of this effective - repulsive potential behavior is the possibility to map the thermodynamic properties of a gp system onto a bg one by modifying the potential parameters , like the diameter @xmath69 and range @xmath89 of the sw fluid .",
    "this type of mapping has been explored in the past in order to define the equivalence of thermodynamic properties between systems defined by different pair potentials @xcite , that now can be applied by mapping a gp and a bg potential - system .",
    "if we think about the inverse problem , i.e , which is the pair potential that reproduces the experimental values of @xmath82 or @xmath90 of a real substance , it could be possible to assume that part of the information can be hindered in the statistical probability function used to obtain the information , i.e. , to be considering either a bg statistics with a specific potential model or a gp statistics with a modified pair potential .",
    "based on a non - extensive statistical mechanics generalization of the entropy that depends only on the probability , we show that the first term correcting the usual entropy also arises from several @xmath0 distributions .",
    "we also construct the corresponding @xmath1-function and demonstrate that a generalized @xmath1-theorem is fulfilled .",
    "furthermore , expressing this @xmath1 function as a function of the simplest maxwellian state we find , up to a first approximation some modified thermodynamic quantities for an ideal gas showing that a generic correction term appear , resembling the universal behavior founded for the distribution functions .",
    "several simulation results are presented for internal energies and heat capacities for the square - well and lennard - jones potential .",
    "the simulation results support the theoretical results ( for the ideal gas ) showing that an effective repulsive interaction is obtained with the new formalism .",
