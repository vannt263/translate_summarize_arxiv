    "the multiwavelength spectrum of @xmath0-ray blazars shows two prominent broad bumps , the first one extending from radio up to optical- x - ray energy range , and the second one from x - rays up to at least 30 gev and in some cases up to @xmath1 tev .",
    "because many of @xmath0-ray blazars show jets and features of superluminal motion , therefore it is usually assumed that the existence of jets ( and accretion disks ) are necessary conditions for @xmath0-ray production in these sources .",
    "three general scenarios are discussed in the literature . in the _ slow jet model _",
    ", the @xmath0-rays are produced in a relativistic blob of particles moving along the jet with the lorentz factor typically assumed to be of the order of @xmath2 ( consistently with the radio observations of superluminal motion although on a parsec distance scale from the center of active galaxies ) . in the _ fast jet model _ , it is assumed that particles are moving in the inner jet almost rectilinearly with very high lorentz factors @xmath3 .",
    "particles are accelerated close to the inner disk or in the jet .",
    "they are slowed down at the distance of observable radio jets as a result of strong energy losses or isotropization by the perpendicular component of the magnetic field present in the jet .",
    "the third scenario , called the _ collision model _ , propose that @xmath0-ray flares may originate when the compact objects e.g. , clouds from the broad line region , massive stars , or debris of close supernova explosions , collide with the jet plasma .",

    "it is usually considered that the low energy bump in the blazar s spectra is caused by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons .",

    "it may be formed as a result of inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of low energy photons by relativistic electrons , or in a cascade process initiated by relativistic hadrons and/or leptons in the soft radiation and/or magnetic field .",
    "the location of the maximum power in the high energy bump differs significantly between different sources .",
    "this fact should reflect the basic properties of the mechanism of acceleration of particles and/or the propagation of produced @xmath0-rays in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "most of these sources are flat spectrum radio quasars , many of them show feature of superluminal motion , and jets aligned at small angles towards the observer s line of sight .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission probably consists of two components from which the first one is persistent but on a low level and the second one is highly variable on a time scales from a part of a day up to weeks and months .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra of blazars are usually interpreted as a single power low with differential spectral index laying in the range between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "the thickness of the emission region , @xmath17 , is estimated based on the time flight arguments , and @xmath18 is the velocity of light .",
    "this energy may be transported from the central engine in the form of the kinetic energy of the jet plasma or in the form of the poynting flux ( see e.g. romanova & lovelace  1997 ) .",

    "( 1 ) with the required energy density of the magnetic field , we obtain lower limit on the magnetic field strength in the emission region as a function of the jet lorentz factor    @xmath19    if we put into this formula the parameters observed during the flare in pks 1622 - 297 , we get the magnetic field strength in the emission region as a function of its lorentz factor which is for example : @xmath20 g if @xmath21 , @xmath22 g if @xmath23 , and @xmath24 g if @xmath25 if the value of parameter @xmath26 is close to one , the conclusion from these simple considerations is the following , either    * the jets are fast with the lorentz factor @xmath27 , or * the @xmath0-rays are produced rather close to the central engine , or * the energy is transferred in the jet mainly in the form of kinetic energy of the jet plasma .    in the next section",
    "we discuss briefly models proposed as possible explanations of @xmath0-ray production in gev blazars .",
    "earlier models constructed with the purpose to explain the gev @xmath0-ray emission from blazars use a soft radiation of external or internal origin in respect to the jet as a target for relativistic particles .",
    "the target radiation of synchrotron origin , produced internally , is postulated by the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models ( e.g. maraschi et al .",
    "1992 , bloom & marscher  1996 , inoue & takahara  1996 , mastichiadis & kirk  1997 ) , and by proton initiated cascade model ( mannheim & biermann  1992 ) . the external radiation coming directly from the accretion disk is used as a target for particles accelerated in the jet by dermer & schlickeiser  ( 1993 ) .",
    "the disk radiation which is quasi - isotropised by scattering on the matter distributed around the disk is applied by sikora et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and blandford & levinson  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the interaction of particles with the quasi - isotropised jet radiation is proposed by ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "it is argued by dermer & schlickeiser  ( 1994 ) that the @xmath0-ray production by electrons which scatter direct disk radiation is more efficient close to the accretion disk , but at further distances the scattering of isotropized disk radiation may dominate .",
    "it seems that the recent observations of flares varying on a very short time scales favour the production of @xmath0-rays rather close to the disk , provided that the jet is slow ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however if the @xmath0-rays are really produced by scattering the quasi - isotropic radiation at farther distances from the disk , then the assumption on a slow jet is not further relevant , and better description of the distribution of particles in the jet is given by the fast jet model .",
    "the problem on the origin of soft target photons can become more clear if some @xmath0-ray blazars ( of bl lac type ) would show strong x - ray flares without accompanied tev @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "such behaviour could be interpreted that the electrons are accelerated to sufficiently high energies to produce tev @xmath0-rays but these energetic photons are absorbed by quasi - isotropic radiation .",
    "different models proposed up to now need different conditions in the source region .",
    "therefore different radiation mechanisms may in fact operate in this same source but the observed spectrum may be dominated by only one or two of them .",
    "the above mentioned models and their relevance to the observations has been discussed already in the reviews mentioned in the introduction .",
    "further in this subsection we describe the models which were not considered in the previous reviews .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra observed from blazars may be also formed as a result of cascades developing in the jet or close to the surface of an accretion disk .",
    "such interpretation has been considered in the context of the compton gro observations of blazars by coppi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , bednarek & kirk  ( 1995 ) , bednarek  ( 1997a ) and bednarek & protheroe  ( 1997d ) .",
    "coppi et al .",
    "assumed that electrons ( or protons ) are injected instantaneously at certain distance , measured along the jet , with very high lorentz factors ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "they analyze the cascade developing in the disk radiation applying different models for the disk emission .",
    "the approach of bednarek & kirk ( 1995 ) is different since in their work the importance of interaction of particles , with the radiation coming from the thick accretion disk , during acceleration in the jet is discussed .",
    "the cascade in the radiation and electric fields is analyzed .",
    "it is found that in certain conditions the energy of particles gained from the electric field can be very efficiently transferred to @xmath0-rays .",
    "another cascade scenario is proposed by bednarek ( 1997a ) and bednarek & protheroe ( 1997d ) . following the model for acceleration of particles close to the accretion disk surface ( haswell et al .",
    "1992 ) , we consider the cascade developing in the disk radiation and magnetic fields above the disk surface .",
    "particles can be accelerated close the disk surface in strong electric fields , induced in reconnection of magnetic fields which are additionally multiplied by the disk differential rotation ( haswell et al .",
    "extremely high potential drops , of the order of @xmath29 ev , can appear according to such a model .",
    "both types of particles ( electrons and protons ) can be accelerated in this same source in the reconnection regions of opposite polarity .",
    "bednarek  ( 1997a ) analyzes the cascades initiated by primary electrons and defines the conditions for such cascades to occur .",
    "it is shown that for strong disk radiation field and slightly curved reconnection region the acceleration of electrons is saturated by their curvature energy losses .",
    "this process transfers very efficiently energy from electrons to extremely high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "these @xmath0-ray photons are able to initiate cascade in the magnetic field above the reconnection region via magnetic @xmath30 pair production and quantum synchrotron radiation .",
    "when the @xmath30 magnetic pair cascade becomes inefficient , the absorption of @xmath0-rays in the disk radiation and the synchrotron emission of secondary @xmath30 pairs determines the formation of the @xmath0-ray spectrum escaping from active galaxy .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra , obtained in such a model , are consistent with the observations of gev @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "they can extend through the tev @xmath0-ray energy range if the disk temperature is relatively low .",
    "the cascades initiated by protons accelerated in the reconnection regions follow partly different scenario ( bednarek & protheroe  1997d ) . the curvature losses of protons are much smaller than these ones suffered by electrons , therefore protons are accelerated without significant losses in a relatively small scale reconnection regions . depending on the parameters of the model ( magnetic field strength , temperature of the local disk radiation and length of the acceleration region )",
    ", protons can be injected into the disk radiation with energies corresponding to the maximum potential drop , or with energies limited by the condition for saturation of the electric field by the products of the cascades initiated by secondary @xmath30 pairs produced in collisions of protons with radiation .",
    "if the radiation field in the acceleration region is strong then the secondary @xmath30 pairs can take most of the energy from the electric field and further processes should occur as in the case considered by bednarek  ( 1997a ) .",
    "the conditions for specific scenarios mentioned above are discussed in detail in bednarek & protheroe  ( 1997d ) .",
    "the protons , injected from the acceleration region into the disk radiation with energies corresponding to the full available potential drop , escape to the surrounding galaxy ( if disk radiation is weak ) or lose energy mainly on pion production in collisions with the disk photons .",
    "the @xmath30 pairs from decay of pions are energetic enough to initiate magnetic @xmath30 pair cascade . for the strong disk radiation",
    "the @xmath0-rays are absorbed in the soft radiation field and the emerging @xmath0-ray spectra show cut - offs at @xmath31 gev , consistently with the observations of gev @xmath0-ray blazars but not with the observations of tev @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "since the charged pions are produced in hadronic collisions , this @xmath0-ray emission is accompanied by the neutrino emission with fluxes comparable to the @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "the characteristic energies of neutrinos are of the order of @xmath32 ev .",
    "we have computed the neutrino power spectrum which should accompany the strong @xmath0-ray flare observed from 3c 279 during june 91 , and have found that the expected number of neutrinos observed during the 10 day flare should give on average coincident one neutrino event in 1 km@xmath33 detector with the angular resolution of one degree .",
    "this rate is orders of magnitudes above the atmospheric neutrino background in such detector .",
    "therefore the gev @xmath0-ray blazars are expected to emit detectable neutrino fluxes in contrary to the tev @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "the production of high energy radiation in collisions of particles with matter seems to be less likely at present because of the problems with finding dense enough target .",
    "however , in principle , particles might interact with the matter accumulated in the thick accretion disk as discussed by bednarek  ( 1993a ) or with the dense clouds from the broad emission line region ( dar & laor  1997 ) .",
    "the interactions of relativistic particles with matter of the host galaxy , containing blazar type agn , may also contribute to the low level @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "it seems obvious that because of the violent activity of the nucleus , the density of relativistic particles in the volume of galaxy containing active nucleus has to be orders of magnitude higher than in our own galaxy .",
    "provided that the relativistic particles escape efficiently from the acceleration regions in the jet and a significant part is accumulated in the galaxy by galactic magnetic fields , we should expect low level of @xmath0-ray emission e.g. , from nearby radio galaxies , even if they do not show characteristic features of blazars .",
    "the persistent @xmath0-ray luminosity of such radio galaxy can be estimated by using simple formula    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the proton - proton cross section , @xmath18 is the velocity of light , @xmath36 is the characteristic residence time of relativistic protons in the host galaxy , which is taken to be equal to the activity phase , @xmath37 , of the blazar type agn , or to the escape time , @xmath38 , of the protons from the host galaxy .",
    "@xmath39 is the average density of background matter in the host galaxy , @xmath40 is the efficiency of accumulation of the particles accelerated in the jet by the host galaxy , and @xmath41 is the power in particles accelerated in the jet . for example , taking @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 years , and @xmath45 erg s@xmath8 ( e.g. @xmath46 and @xmath47 erg s@xmath8 ) , then the persistent @xmath0-ray luminosity of the radio galaxy is @xmath48 erg s@xmath8 .",

    "1995 ) .",
    "one of the first type of models in which the production of @xmath0-rays in active galaxies has been discussed is so called `` synchrotron self - compton model '' ( ssc ) . in the simplest version of this model ( homogeneous model ) the low energy part of the spectrum ( from radio to x - rays ) and the high energy part ( from x - rays to @xmath0-rays )",
    "are produced in this same homogeneous and isotropic region ( a blob ) by a single population of electrons .",
    "the electrons , accelerated by a shock moving in the jet , lose energy on synchrotron process in the blob magnetic field and on inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of these synchrotron photons to @xmath0-ray energies ( e.g. inoue & takahara  1996 , bloom & marscher  1996 , mastichiadis & kirk  1997 ) .",
    "such a picture naturally explains synchronized variability at different photon energies .",
    "application of this model to the observations of tev @xmath0-ray emission from mrk 421 has been recently tested by bednarek & protheroe  ( 1997c ) .",
    "based on the detected variability time scales of tev @xmath0-ray emission , observations of coincident flares in x - rays and tev @xmath0-rays , and the observed multiwavelength photon spectrum of mrk 421 , the constraints has been placed on the allowed parameter space ( magnetic field in the emission region and its doppler factor ) for the homogeneous ssc model .",
    "for the 1 day flare , the magnetic field in the blob has to be limited to the range @xmath55 g , and the corresponding doppler factors to the range @xmath56 .",
    "for the 15 min flare these limits are following : @xmath57 g , and @xmath58 .",
    "the spectra calculated in terms of the homogeneous ssc model , for the marginal values of the allowed parameter space , are consistent with the available spectral information above @xmath59 tev in the case of a flare varying on a 1 day time scale .",
    "however for recently reported very short 15 min flare , the calculated spectra are significantly steeper , suggesting that the homogeneous ssc model has problems with describing relatively flat spectra observed up to @xmath1 tev .",
    "the problems met by the homogeneous ssc model might be avoided if the assumption on spherical geometry of the blob is released .",
    "recently kirk  ( 1997 ) has proposed that the blob of relativistic electrons should have rather a form of a thin plane with the ratio , @xmath26 , of the thickness to broadness much lower than one . for the case of 15 min flare from mrk 421",
    ", this value has been estimated as equal to @xmath60 , based on the assumption that the variability time scale of synchrotron emission is determined by the cooling time of electrons ( see also takahashi 1996 ) .",
    "however in the case when the period of activity of acceleration mechanism determines the flare timescale ( bednarek & protheroe 1997c ) , than the values of magnetic field and aspect ratio @xmath26 , estimated by kirk ( 1997 ) , becomes a lower limit .",
    "more complicated inhomogeneous ssc models in which the radiation at different energies is produced in different regions of the jet ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",

    "they are not constrained by the arguments discussed above .",

    "for example in the case of qso 1633 + 382 , which is the egret detected @xmath0-ray blazar at large distance , the constraints are also more restrictive than obtained on the base of superluminal motion alone ( bednarek  1996 ) .",
    "the multiwavelength campaign has been established for the observations of mrk 421 during may 1995 .",
    "the obtained optical , extreme uv , x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray light curves shows very interesting behaviour ( see fig .  3 in buckley et al .",

    "the x - ray light curve shows also quasi - periodicity , although on a day time scale , as noted by takahashi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and schubnell ( 1997 ) .",
    "this possible quasi - periodicity is not easily explained in the models which assume that high energy emission comes from a relativistic blob moving along the jet ( see models mentioned in the introduction ) .",

    "the model predicts also small time delay between x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission caused by the different path lengths to the observer from the emission regions of these radiations .",
    "dar & laor ( 1997 ) proposed that tev @xmath0-ray flares may originate in hadronic collisions of a highly collimated relativistic proton beam ( lorentz factors up to @xmath71 ) with small , dense clouds entering the jet . in this model",
    "the high level of variability of tev @xmath0-ray flux in comparison with gev @xmath0-ray flux is caused by stronger collimation of tev @xmath0-rays in respect to gev @xmath0-rays if they originate in hadronic collisions .",
    "this fact was previously noted and discussed in astrophysical context by bednarek et al .",
    "however , for typical parameters of the clouds in agns ( cloud temperature @xmath71 k , density @xmath72 @xmath43 , and radius @xmath73 cm ) , the effects of collisionless excitation of plasma waves by relativistic electron - proton beams may become very efficient energy loss mechanism specially for beams with the lorentz factors below @xmath74 ( rose et al .",
    "therefore the gev @xmath0-rays can not be produced efficiently in such a model , since protons with @xmath75 are not able to penetrate over distances comparable to the typical cloud radius .",

    "for example , the central dense stellar core in the galactic center is @xmath76 stars pc@xmath77 ( eckart et al . 1993 ) , and the central total mass density has been estimated on @xmath78 pc@xmath77 ( eckart & genzel  1996 ) . in m32 the central stellar density exceeds @xmath79 m@xmath80 pc@xmath77 ( lauer et al .  1992 ) . if the massive star with a strong stellar wind ( e.g. wolf - rayet or ob type ) enters the jet then as a result of stellar wind ",
    "jet plasma collisions a double shock structure should form at some distance from the star surface .",
    "the electrons accelerated by such shocks produce x in synchrotron process and @xmath0-rays by scattering soft thermal photons coming from the massive star .",
    "this high energy emission is likely to be collimated along the shock front since it is expected that the distribution of electrons accelerated by relativistic and oblique shock can be highly anisotropic ( kirk & heavens  1989 , ostrowski  1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra computed in terms of such a model can extend through the tev energy range and the expected variability time scales are consistent with the observations of a two week high level of tev @xmath0-ray emission observed in mrk 421 ( see bednarek & protheroe  1997a ) .",
    "moreover this model suggest possible another explanation of quasi - periodic oscillations of tev @xmath0-ray flux on a time scale of days as due to the rotation of a massive star .",
    "rotation effect causes periodic variation of the magnetic fields in the region of the shocks and consequently influences the acceleration efficiency of electrons .      as we have mentioned above the density of massive stars in the central region of active galaxy ( @xmath81 ) can be very high .",
    "therefore it is expected that the supernova rate in central parsec is high .",
    "the expending supernova shell can significantly compress the jet plasma if the explosion occurs relatively close to the jet .",
    "we can estimate this distance by comparing the pressure of the material in the supernova shell with the pressure of the jet plasma .",
    "the supernova pressure is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the supernova kinetic power in units of @xmath84 erg , @xmath85 is the mass of the shell and @xmath86 is its velocity .",
    "@xmath87 is the radius of the shell in parsecs . by comparing supernova shell pressure with the jet plasma pressure",
    "( see eq .  1 in bednarek & protheroe 1997a )",
    "we can estimate    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the jet power in units of @xmath90 erg s@xmath8 , @xmath91 is its opening angle in units of @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the distance in parsecs .",
    "note that if @xmath87 is of the order of @xmath93 then all supernovae exploding below @xmath93 has to interact strongly with the jet .",
    "this condition ( @xmath94 ) defines the distance @xmath95 below which all supernovae create strong shocks in the jet ,    @xmath96    above @xmath95 only a part of exploding supernovae , of the order of @xmath97 , create strong shocks in the jet . as a result of such interaction a large scale ( @xmath98 cm ) relativistic shock can be formed in the jet plasma with the magnetic field strength on the front significantly higher than expected in isolated supernovae , because of the stronger magnetic field strength in the jet . in such scenario the particles can reach energies @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the shock acceleration efficiency , which is of the order of @xmath101 for relativistic shocks ( protheroe  1997 ) , @xmath102 is the elemental electric change , and @xmath18 is the velocity of light .",
    "for example if the magnetic field in the jet is @xmath103 gs and @xmath104 cm , then particles can reach energies of the order of @xmath105 ev , where @xmath106 is the atomic number of accelerated nuclei .",
    "note that @xmath106 can be very high since a lot of very heavy nuclei are expected to originate during the supernova explosion .",
    "if the shell front is not uniform but contains smaller scale debris , then the number of shocks in the jet should be created and the particles accelerated by them may interact with the accretion disk radiation ( direct of reprocessed by a matter surrounding the disk ) producing @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "this picture is complementary with the model of @xmath0-ray production in agns considered by bednarek , kirk & mastichiadis  ( 1996a , b ) .",
    "the comptel telescope on the compton gro has detected a few blazars whose power spectra show very strong peaks at mev energies ( blom et al .",
    "1995 , bloemen et al .",
    "it is clear that two spectral components can be identified in such type of sources , the mev peak and close to the power law spectrum extending through the egret energy range ( kanbach  1996 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the most prominent source of this type is variable with the spectral index in the egret energy range changing from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ( blom et al .",
    "1996 ) and shows a cut - off at a few gev ( kanbach  1996 ) .",
    "these observations are often interpreted in terms of the @xmath30 pair annihilation in a jet model ( e.g. marcowith et al .",
    "1995 , roland & hermsen  1995 , bttcher & schlickeiser  1996 , skibo et al .",
    "however sikora & madejski  ( 1996 ) argue that this model can not explain the mev excesses since jets are optically thin and the @xmath30 pair annihilation is not efficient .",
    "the annihilation model has also serious problems with explanation of the recent observations of 3c273 ( mcnaron - brown et al .",
    "the spectrum of 3c 273 shows clear break at @xmath109 mev which is inconsistent with the blueshifted @xmath30 annihilation line in a jet .",
    "motivated by this problems , sikora & madejski  ( 1996 ) proposes that the mev bump is produced by second population of electrons with energies @xmath31 mev present in the jet .",
    "recently we have proposed another possible explanation of these intriguing observations ( bednarek  1997b ) .",
    "let us consider the general scenario in which electrons are accelerated in the jet either rectilinearly in small regions along the jet ( bednarek & kirk  1995 , bednarek et al .",
    "1996a , b ) or quasi - isotropically in a shock moving through the jet ( e.g. dermer & schlickeiser  1993 , sikora et al .",
    "1994 , blandford & levinson  1995 ) .",
    "relativistic electrons can inverse compton scatter soft radiation coming from a thin accretion disk ( as considered by dermer & schlickeiser  1993 and bednarek et al .",
    "1996 ) or from a thick accretion disk ( melia & knigl  1989 and bednarek & kirk  1995 ) .",
    "however if the disk geometry changes from the thin one ( in the outer disk part ) to the thick one ( in the inner part ) then this same population of electrons can produce strong peak at mev energies ( or below ) , by scattering the radiation of a thick disk .",
    "close to a power law type spectrum extending above a few tens of mev through the gev energy range , originates at further distances along the jet as a result of scattering the radiation of the thin disk . by changing only the acceleration efficiency along the jet ( keeping constant the disk parameters )",
    "we are able to fit very different spectra of pks0208 - 512 observed during two periods : may - june 93 , and july 91 - jan 92 . the cut - off in the spectrum observed from this source at a few gev",
    "is explained by the lack of saturation of electron acceleration by the ics energy losses at further distances along the jet . at such distances electrons",
    "are injected into the jet with the maximum possible energies gained from acceleration regions and lose energy mainly on synchrotron mechanism in random component of the jet magnetic field .",
    "two types of the soft radiation field , through which the relativistic jet propagates , can be also identified with the direct disk radiation and the quasi ",
    "isotropic radiation , reprocessed by the matter surrounding the accretion disk .",
    "these two radiation fields has been discussed separately in earlier models .",
    "the @xmath0-ray observations of blazars have given us unique inside into the energetic processes occurring within central parsec of active galaxies .",
    "they put already very strong constraints on possible theoretical interpretations .",
    "only a few general pictures made an effort to incorporate in a consistent model the variety of reported observational features like , very short time scale variability , different types of blazars ( mev , gev , tev ) , emission extending up to at least @xmath1 tev . in my opinion such a picture is given in papers which discuss the general model proposed initially by dermer , schlickeiser & mastichiadis  ( 1992 ) ( and developed by dermer & schlickeiser  1993 , 1994 ; bttcher & schlickeiser  1996 ; bttcher , mause & schlickeiser  1996 ; skibo , dermer & schlickeiser  1997 ; dermer , sturner & schlickeiser  1997 ) , or the model considered by bednarek & kirk  ( 1995 ) ( and developed in bednarek , kirk & mastichiadis  1996a , b ; bednarek  1997b ) . such complementary description can be found in the model proposed by sikora , begelman & rees  ( 1994 ) ( see also , sikora & madejski  1996 ; sikora , begelman & madejski  1997 ) .",
    "some new ideas has been also investigated recently .",
    "they base on a less popular fast jet model ( bednarek  1997a , bednarek & protheroe  1997d ) , or propose that @xmath0-rays may originate during collisions of compact objects ( clouds , massive stars , supernova shocks or supernova debris ) with the jet plasma ( dar & laor  1997 ; bednarek & protheroe  1997a ; or by bednarek in this paper ) . the simultaneous spectral information obtained recently at different energy ranges (",
    "although not yet completely satisfactory ) suggests that the processes occurring there may be more complex than considered previously . it will be not surprising if a few different radiation mechanisms , possibly operating at different locations are needed in order to explain the observations .",
    "they suggest also that the inner jets in blazars may be much faster than supposed previously based on the radio observations .",
    "their lorentz factors can be as high as @xmath31 which is consistent with the observations of intraday variability in some agns ( begelman et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "it is likely that part of particles , accelerated in the jet , can be trapped inside the host blazar galaxy .",
    "this hypothesis can be checked by deep observations of nearby radio galaxies which are supposed to be misdirected blazars ( e.g. cen a , morganti et al .",
    "in fact the closest radio galaxy , cen a , may be an example of such type of @xmath0-ray source already detected by the egret telescope .",
    "the real progress in understanding the @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms in blazars would be done with the detection ( or non - detection ) of the neutrino signals from these objects with the power comparable to their @xmath0-ray power .",
    "this would decide about importance of the hadronic processes in blazars considered by a few models ( e.g. mannheim & biermann 1992 , bednarek 1993 , coppi et al .",
    "1993 , protheore 1997 , bednarek & protheroe 1997d ) .",
    "some models ( bednarek 1997 , bednarek & proteroe 1997d ) suggest , moreover , that only fsrq blazars ( gev blazars ) may emit neutrinos and @xmath0-rays , in contrary to bl lac type blazars ( tev blazars ) which may be sources of only @xmath0-rays .",
    "i would like to thank the organizing committee of the frascati workshop for partial financial support which allowed my participation in this workshop .",
    "this work is supported by the university of d grant no ."
