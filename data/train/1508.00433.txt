    "@xmath139 is to make a lorentz transformation .",
    "consider the following lorentz transformation @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an @xmath144 transformation matrix whose determinant is @xmath145 .",
    "then obviously we can generate a new classical solution @xmath146 this solution is a tilted domain wall moving in a transverse direction with a constant velocity . since @xmath147",
    "it is possible to regard @xmath148 so , once we obtain a domain wall effective action as a function of the lorentz transformation matrix elements @xmath143 , using ( [ zdef ] ) we can regard it as a domain wall effective action for @xmath136 .    let us calculate the effective action of the domain wall . substituting the transformed solution ( [ ltr ] ) into the original action , we can obtain the effective action @xmath149 to compute this integral , we use the following trick . the new domain wall solution ( [ ltr ] ) depends only on @xmath150 while the spacetime coordinates @xmath133 should be kept as it is , so we consider a general coordinate transformation ( note that it is not a lorentz transformation ) @xmath151 the transformation for @xmath110 is the same as the lorentz transformation ( [ l3 ] ) while @xmath133 is kept intact .",
    "for this general coordinate transformation , the jacobian is found as @xmath152 so the metric is transformed as @xmath153 the last equality is due to the @xmath144 nature of the lorentz transformation @xmath143 .",
    "note that there appears nontrivial off - diagonal elements of the metric such as @xmath154 , although they are irrelevant in the following calculations .",
    "when we substitute the new solution ( [ ltr ] ) into the lagrangian , we may use the new lagrangian transformed by the general coordinate transformation ( [ l3n ] ) ( [ lmn ] ) , since the lagrangian is a scalar quantity under the general coordinate transformation .",
    "the solution depends only on @xmath150 , so all derivatives @xmath155 acting on the solution vanishes .",

    "previously we derived the effective action of the internal moduli of the domain wall , using the equations of motion and explicit solutions . here , we shall utilize an embedding to a spacetime with an extra dimension , to derive the same expressions for the effective action of the internal moduli .",
    "first , we study what form of the lagrangian can give a domain wall with an internal moduli space @xmath30 .",
    "next , we embed the scalar system into a higher dimensional spacetime where the internal phase rotation is related to the extra dimensional coordinate",

    "the lagrangian is assumed to have only two derivatives at maximum , for simplicity ; @xmath168 the mass term is intendedly separated from the potential functional @xmath169 .",
    "this system has a @xmath27 global symmetry which rotates the phase of the field , @xmath170 we assume the existence of a domain wall solution @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a real function which interpolates two vacua which have the same energy .",
    "we need an @xmath30 moduli for the domain wall , so the domain wall needs to be a solution even if we rotate it as @xmath173 this , in particular , means that the vacua , @xmath174 and @xmath31 , have to be a fixed point of the @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "otherwise the @xmath27 rotation changes the vacuum and so the moduli becomes non - normalizable , which means there is no sense in discussing effective action of the moduli parameters .",
    "generically the fixed points of the phase rotation are only @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) , so this condition of having the @xmath30 moduli constrains the lagrangian as follows : the total potential @xmath178 has two minima at @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in the following ,",
    "we treat this system .",
    "several examples will be given in later .",
    "whether the internal moduli parameter can be regarded as another spatial coordinate or not is an important question .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the nambu - goto action can be obtained by the lorentz transformation of the soliton solution .",
    "so , here , we consider a lorentz transformation including the internal moduli direction",
    ". we will be careful about what situation we can perform the lorentz transformation , below .",
    "first , we need to introduce the internal coordinate . since the @xmath30 moduli is associated with the phase @xmath27 symmetry acting on the field @xmath26 , it is natural to upgrade the phase factor of the domain wall solution to the additional spatial coordinate @xmath96 .",
    "the new internal space needs to be compact , so we define a new complex scalar field @xmath179 which lives in the @xmath180-dimensional spacetime spanned by @xmath101 , as @xmath181 the form is written in a fourier expansion where @xmath103 is the fourier mode number . in addition , we have introduced an overall factor @xmath182 by the following reason .",
    "let us prepare the following @xmath183-dimensional action @xmath184 then , substituting the expansion ( [ ssdef ] ) , the factor @xmath182 provides exactly the mass term in the @xmath166-dimensional action ( [ s4 ] ) .",
    "in fact , when we have only the @xmath185 mode in ( [ ssdef ] ) , then substituting it to ( [ s5d+2 ] ) exactly reproduces ( [ s4 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath186 in ( [ ssdef ] ) manifests a twisted periodicity condition @xmath187 which is called scherk - schwarz compactification @xcite .",
    "now , we have the domain wall solution @xmath107 of the original @xmath63 , then @xmath188 is a solution of the equation of motion of @xmath189 .",
    "this solution just have the @xmath185 component of the expansion ( [ ssdef ] ) .",
    "since it is a solution of @xmath189 , and since @xmath189 appears to be lorentz invariant in @xmath183 dimensions , we can make use of the @xmath183-dimensional lorentz transformation to create a new classical solution .",
    "in particular we are interested in the internal coordinate @xmath96 , let us make a transformation in the sub - spacetime spanned by @xmath96 and @xmath133 . as in the previous section , the lorentz transformation is @xmath190 we act this transformation to obtain a new solution , @xmath191 note that this is a solution of @xmath189 while it is not a solution of the original @xmath166-dimensional @xmath63 .",
    "the reason is that to make the reduction to the @xmath20 dimensions we need the relation ( [ up4 ] ) where the dependence on the extra dimension is @xmath186 , while the new solution ( [ newsol ] ) has a different phase factor @xmath192 .",
    "in fact , a new @xmath166-dimensional solution which can be read off from ( [ newsol ] ) as @xmath193 is not a solution of @xmath63 but a solution of @xmath194 the reason is obvious .",
    "the @xmath96 dependence in the new solution ( [ newsol ] ) provides , together with the @xmath96 derivatives in @xmath189 , a new mass term which is @xmath195 instead of the original @xmath196 . in other words",

    "we are ready for evaluating the effective action .",
    "let us first calculate it as an effective action of a @xmath183-dimensional solution .",
    "( that is , we here calculate first the effective action without the above replacement of @xmath18 .",
    "later we shall incorporate the effect of the replacement . )",
    "the on - shell action is @xmath201 and to evaluate this explicitly we perform a general coordinate transformation @xmath202 as in the previous section .",

    "\\label{sinv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last equality we have defined the on - shell action for the original domain wall with the @xmath166-dimensional lagrangian , @xmath206 ( [ sinv ] ) means that the on - shell action is independent of the lorentz transformation parameters appearing in the solution .",
    "however , we have to remember the fact that the new solution ( [ newsolphi ] ) is not a solution of @xmath63 but a solution of @xmath207 defined in ( [ rep ] ) which is given by the replacement @xmath208 .",
    "so , as mentioned in ( [ newp ] ) , to have a solution of the original @xmath166-dimensional lagrangian , we need to make a redefinition of @xmath18 as @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , the correct effective action of the domain wall described by the solution ( [ newp ] ) is given by ( [ sinv ] ) with the replacement ,",
    "@xmath210    we shall reinterpret the factor @xmath211 as a function of the moduli . the procedure is already given in the previous section . comparing the constant moduli parameter @xmath3 in the solution ( [ epsol_s ] ) and the new solution ( [ newp ] )",
    ", we can regard the dynamical moduli parameter to have a configuration in the new solution as @xmath212 this is reminiscent of ( [ zdef ] ) for the translational zero mode @xmath0 in the previous section .",
    "so , similarly , we have @xmath213 substituting this expression to the domain wall effective action ( [ dwac ] ) , we obtain the final form of the generic effective action for the internal moduli @xmath214 of the domain wall as @xmath215 this precisely reproduces ( [ sdw ] ) .",
    "the generic action is a function of the nambu - goto action . in the next subsection",
    ", we learn a condition of having the nambu - goto form .",
    "our final expression for the effective action of the internal moduli is ( [ dwres ] ) . obviously , the condition that this action becomes nambu - goto action is to have a linear @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a constant",
    ".    we will find below that a sufficient condition to have a nambu - goto action for the effective action , in other words , to have a linear @xmath40 , is to start with @xmath218 in the original @xmath166-dimensional lagrangian .",
    "when @xmath219 , the total action is @xmath220 here we put @xmath221 which is satisfied for the solution .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence can be absorbed into the rescaling @xmath222 , such that @xmath223 is with respect to @xmath224 .",
    "now the @xmath18 dependence appears only as an overall factor , so the equation of motion is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "then the domain wall solution is written as @xmath225 which is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "recovering the @xmath18 dependence , we obtain a solution @xmath226 . substituting this into the action",

    ", we obtain a linear dependence , @xmath229    so , in summary , for a @xmath166-dimensional system whose action is given by @xmath230 the internal moduli appearing in the solution as @xmath231 has an effective action of the nambu - goto form , @xmath232 where the overall coefficient @xmath217 is given by @xmath233    the nambu - goto action in 1 + 2 dimensions is equivalent to the born - infeld action .",
    "so we complete the derivation of the born - infeld action as an effective action of an internal moduli of a domain wall , for a class of 1 + 3 dimensional complex scalar field theories whose lagrangian is of the form ( [ s4v0 ] ) .      the nambu - goto action ( [ dwng ] ) shows the existence of the speed limit . as we parameterized the internal space as ( [ me ] )",
    ", this shows that the speed limit in the internal space is @xmath18 .",
    "so , the mass term in the original action has quite an important property : it serves as the speed limit in the internal space .",
    "looking at the generic effective action ( [ dwres ] ) which we obtained , it exhibits interesting structure : it is a function of a nambu - goto lagrangian .",
    "since the nambu - goto lagrangian indicates the speed limit , the generic action may have the speed limit in the internal space .",
    "the critical speed is indeed the mass , @xmath18 .",
    "one may notice that the separation between the mass term and the potential term @xmath25 is arbitrary in our calculation .",
    "indeed , one can split the original mass term as @xmath234 where @xmath235 , and regard the @xmath236 term as a potential term , while @xmath237 term as a mass term . following the same procedure as the previous subsection , we obtain an effective action @xmath238 where @xmath239 here the internal moduli field @xmath240 is defined as @xmath241 notice the difference from ( [ me ] ) : the definitions of the moduli fields are related as @xmath242 now , obviously the splitting of the mass term should not change the resultant effective action , so ( [ eff12 ] ) should be equal to ( [ dwres ] ) .",
    "indeed , if one notice the equality @xmath243 it is easy to show the equivalence of ( [ eff12 ] ) and ( [ dwres ] ) , through the relation ( [ me3 ] ) .",
    "an example satisfying this condition @xmath219 and also the condition of having two minima in ( [ vcond ] ) is a massive @xmath57 sigma model ( [ cp1 ] ) , @xmath244 the vacua are located at @xmath175 and @xmath176 as mentioned above , and an explicit domain wall solution is @xmath245 since the system is with @xmath219 , the solution is of the form @xmath246 as explained in the previous section .",
    "the on - shell action is given by @xmath247 = \\int d^dx \\",
    "( -m ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the effective action is of the nambu - goto type given in eq .",
    "( [ dwng ] ) with @xmath248 .",
    "let us verify if the nambu - goto action correctly describe dynamics of domain wall .",
    "for that purpose , it is simple to see a time - dependent solution , namely the so - called q - kink domain wall @xcite .",
    "the solution is obtained through a standard bogomolnyi technique as @xmath249 with the noether charge @xmath250 and the topological charge @xmath251 .",
    "the energy bound from below is the most stringent when @xmath252 . expressing @xmath253 and @xmath254",
    ", we get the bps solution and mass formula of the q - kink domain wall @xmath255 we can derive the same mass formula from the effective lagrangian of the nambu - goto type . the lagrangian is @xmath256 a conjugate momentum is given by @xmath257 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath258 reading @xmath259 dependence of @xmath214 from the q - kink domain wall solution ( [ eq : sol_qkdw ] ) , we find @xmath260 . plugging this into @xmath261 , we find @xmath262 this is precisely the same as the bps mass formula given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol_qkdw ] ) .",
    "thus , we confirm the nambu - goto action works very well as the effective action .",
    ".,width=377 ]    in the previous subsection , we have seen the simplest example in which the effective action of the domain wall corresponds to the usual nambu - goto action . in this section",
    ", we will see an example that the effective theory is not of the simple nambu - goto type .",
    "we will again consider the massive @xmath263 model .",
    "but we introduce an additional higher order interaction term ( [ v_a ] ) @xmath264 where we assume @xmath265 .",
    "the total scalar potential is positive definite , so that @xmath266 and @xmath267 remain as the global vacua with zero vacuum energy .",
    "in addition , a new local minimum appears at @xmath268 due to the additional term in the potential .",
    "thus , a domain wall interpolating the vacua @xmath269 still exists but it is deformed compared to the one in the massive @xmath263 sigma model in the previous subsection .",
    "an advantage of the particular choice of the potential ( [ eq : pot_dsg ] ) is that we will have an analytic solution of the domain wall with which we can analytically obtain an effective action of the deformed domain wall .    in order to illustrate the situation better ,",
