    "they have also computed the asymptotic number variance coefficients for a number of common lattices , including the square , triangular , fcc , and bcc crystal structures .",
    "further examples of hyperuniform systems include all periodic point patterns , certain quasi - periodic systems , and special disordered point patterns .",
    "we remark that a mathematical ( or _ bravais _ ) _ lattice _ is a system of points in euclidean space with a set of minimal basis vectors @xmath0 such that any point in the lattice can be generated by taking integral linear combinations of the basis vectors .",
    "other periodic structures can be formed by including more than one point in a fundamental cell , and we will occasionally refer to such structures as nonlattices . unless otherwise noted , our usage of the term _ lattice _ will exclusively apply to bravais lattices .    here",
    "we generalize the notion of hyperuniformity to heterogeneous media , wherein one characterizes the local fluctuations in the volume fraction .",
    "a _ heterogeneous medium _ , also known in the mathematics literature as a _ random set _",
    ", is a partition of @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 into disjoint regions ( phases ) with interfaces that are known only probabilistically . throughout this paper",
    "we will consider two - phase heterogeneous media .",
    "microstructural information for the system is contained in the indicator function @xmath3 for each phase @xmath4 , defined by : @xmath5 of particular importance is the so - called two - point probability function @xmath6 @xcite , which is defined by : @xmath7 where we have implicitly chosen some reference phase in the system .",
    "note that since one can always construct a heterogeneous medium by `` decorating '' an appropriate point process ( e.g. , circumscription with hexagons or spheres ; see figure [ cartoon ] ) , characterizing the statistical properties of a heterogeneous medium represents a more general problem than the study of point patterns ; namely , the latter systems are recovered as a special limit of the former .",
    "it is therefore intuitive that any physical application of point processes is also important for heterogeneous media .",
    "applications of the hyperuniformity problem for such systems include scattering by heterogeneous media @xcite , transport through composites and porous media @xcite , the study of noise and granularity of photographic images @xcite , identifying properties of organic coatings @xcite , and the fracture of composite materials @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is generally true that any statistical description of the microstructure of a heterogeneous material provides nontrivial information about a wide variety of effective properties of that material in a homogenized sense @xcite .",
    "the local volume fraction @xmath8 of a heterogeneous medium is defined as the fraction of the volume of an observation window covered by a particular phase ( see figure [ cartoon ] ) . for the remainder of this paper we consider spherical observation windows , but",
    "our results are easily extended to windows of arbitrary geometry @xcite .",
    "lu and torquato @xcite have studied the variance @xmath9 of @xmath8 , which they refer to as the _ coarseness _ after suitable scaling , and have shown in the homogeneous case that it is related to the two - point probability function according to : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volume of a sphere of radius @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the so - called scaled intersection volume of two spheres of radius @xmath12 whose centers are separated by a distance @xmath14 ( defined in more detail in section 2 ) , and @xmath15 is the fraction of space in the global medium occupied by the reference phase . for large windows",
    ", these authors showed that in non - hyperuniform media @xmath16^{-1}$ ] .",
    "additionally , quintanilla and torquato @xcite have determined the cumulative distribution functions of the local volume fraction for a number of low - dimensional periodic @xcite and random @xcite media ; it is known that a central - limit result holds for sufficiently large observation windows @xcite .",
    "we mention here that there is an analogous formula for the number variance of a point pattern : @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the so - called total correlation function of the point process .",
    "the details behind these relations are provided in sections 2 and 3 , but it is clear from these remarks that the coarseness of a heterogeneous medium plays a similar role as the local density fluctuations in a point pattern .",
    "figure [ cartoon ] compares the hyperuniformity problem for point patterns and heterogeneous media in both the periodic and nonperiodic cases . unlike the local number density",
    ", the local volume fraction approaches a fixed value @xmath15 on the global scale of the system , meaning that the coarseness must _ decay _ over large length scales .",
    "the analog of hyperuniformity in this instance will involve a decay in the local volume fraction fluctuations that is _ faster _ than the volume of the observation window ; we quantify this behavior in section 3 using the asymptotic scaling of the coarseness .",
    "one important implication of this work is the development of a quantitative order metric characterizing the degree of order in a point pattern . from our experience with low - dimensional systems ,",
    "it is physically intuitive that bravais lattices are in some sense `` more ordered '' than nonlattice structures and quasicrystals , which in turn are seemingly more regular than strongly - correlated disordered point patterns .",
    "furthermore , one also expects that weakly correlated systems are highly disordered .",
    "it is thus an open problem in statistical physics to quantify `` randomness '' in a many - body system with a simple metric that reflects this intuitive ordering .",
    "the observation that hyperuniform point patterns are characterized by a certain regularity in the distribution of points throughout @xmath2 suggests that quantitative measurements of the local number variance can provide one measure of order in point patterns , and we discuss the construction of such a metric in this work .",
    "section 2 reviews the basic notions of stochastic point processes , which are completely characterized by the set of @xmath19-particle correlation functions , and hyperuniformity , which is defined completely by the two - particle information of the point process .",
    "section 3 presents the corresponding results for two - phase heterogeneous media , whereby the fluctuations in the local volume fraction are related to two - point microstructural information of the phases . in general , if a heterogeneous medium can be generated from a stochastic point process , even lower - order microstructural information about the system will require a knowledge of the full @xmath19-particle information of the underlying point process .",
    "however , we show in section 4 that there is a convenient relation between fluctuations in the local number density and the corresponding fluctuations in the local volume fraction for microstructures of spherical inclusions , thereby providing a computationally accessible estimate of the local volume fraction variance .",
    "section 5 presents explicit calculations of the asymptotic coefficients governing the local density fluctuations for a wide range of periodic and disordered point processes in low euclidean dimensions , and these results translate into the aforementioned quantitative order metric characterizing the degree of ( dis)order in a given arrangement of points .",
    "we extend these calculations in section 6 to include the asymptotic properties of these terms for large euclidean dimensions and also to provide information about the corresponding coefficients for the fluctuations in the local volume fraction .",
    "extensive tables of asymptotic coefficients are provided for periodic and nonperiodic systems in sections 5 and 6 , and the reader who wishes to skip the mathematical details of the preceding sections is directed there .",
    "our results have interesting implications for the minimzers of the epstein zeta function , a fundamental problem that arises in number theory .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "a _ stochastic point process _ in @xmath2 is defined as a mapping from a probability space to configurations of points @xmath20 in @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath21 denote the set of configurations such that each configuration @xmath22 is a subset of @xmath2 that satisfies two regularity conditions : ( i ) there are no multiple points ( @xmath23 if @xmath24 ) and ( ii ) each bounded subset of @xmath2 must contain only a finite number of points of @xmath25 .",

    "henceforth , we will simply call this map a point process . note that this random setting is quite general ; it incorporates cases in which the location of the points are deterministically known , such as a lattice .",
    "a point process is completely specified by the countably infinite set of generic @xmath19-particle probability density functions .",
    "the _ generic @xmath19-particle probability density function _ , denoted by @xmath36 , is proportional to the probability density of finding @xmath19 particles in volume elements around the given positions @xmath37 , irrespective of the remaining @xmath38 particles .",
