    "the paradigm of @xmath6cdm cosmology enshrines the importance of hierarchical assembly to the process of galaxy formation .",
    "galaxies such as the milky way are expected to arise from the coalescence of numerous smaller systems .",
    "the idea that the stellar halo of the milky way was formed from the disruption of smaller systems was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the study of @xcite argues that the relative contribution of stars originating in external systems to the halo is dependent on galactocentric radius ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the outer halo ( @xmath7 @xmath8 kpc ) is dominated by lower metallicity material and exhibits kinematics indicative of derivation from accretion .",
    "on the other hand , at @xmath7 @xmath9 kpc the inner halo is dominated by generally higher metallicity and prograde kinematics as would arise from an @xcite in - situ formation scenario .",
    "further , observational studies of the spatial @xcite and kinematic @xcite properties of the halo conclude that accretion has a significant role to play in the construction of the halo .",
    "these studies find accretion is responsible for between 10 - 100% of the extant population depending on the assumed merger tree for the galaxy .",
    "an apparent argument against substantial contribution of accreted stars to the halo is the discrepancy between the chemistry of the most - likely accreted systems , namely , dwarf spheroidal ( dsphs ) galaxies , and the chemistry of the halo ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* and recently , @xcite @xcite ) . at [ fe / h]@xmath10 dex , dsph stars exhibit substantially lower [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios compared to their galactic halo counterparts @xcite .",
    "chemical evolution models @xcite demonstrate this is due to substantially different star formation histories , combined with differences in the ability to retain processed gas , between the milky way and dsph populations .",
    "a solution to the chemical mismatch is that the stellar populations of the present - day dsphs are not representative of the bulk of the material previously contributed to the halo via tidal stripping .",
    "indeed the different chemistry between the present - day dsphs and the halo might simply reflect that these dsphs were able to survive for a hubble time and this has provided an extended timescale for chemical evolution to occur within them @xcite .    as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite ( @xcite ) , tidal disruption of a dsph",
    "in which there is a strong metallicity gradient would lead to the deposition of stars distinct from those surviving in the present - day core . in low mass systems , where orbit swapping processes are expected to be much less effective (",
    "@xcite @xcite ) , and distinct from low mass early - type galaxies that have suffered major mergers ( @xcite @xcite ) , the sense of this metallicity gradient is one of decreasing metallicity with increasing radial distance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has become apparent that the chemistry of some of the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath11 dex ) dsph stars is indistinguishable from that of the halo @xcite .",
    "hence tidal stripping of the metal - poor outskirts of a dsph could lead to the deposition of material that is old , metal - poor and exhibits abundance ratios matching those of the halo @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the chemistry of the stellar population that has been deposited into the outer halo of the galaxy from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr , * ? ? ?",
    "the tidal disruption of the sgr dwarf galaxy is the milky way s most prominent ongoing accretion event .",
    "tidal debris on leading and trailing arms are traced via rr lyrae variables @xcite , blue horizontal branch stars @xcite , m - giants @xcite , subgiants @xcite and main - sequence turn - off stars @xcite .",
    "the tidal debris extends around the sky and represents multiple orbits of sgr around the milky way .",
    "this study utilises high resolution ir spectroscopy obtained on the gemini south telescope to target stars in two regions along the length of the sgr trailing arm .",
    "this enables us to determine the chemistry of material lost on two consecutive perigalactic passages of sgr and hence to investigate the presence of any chemical abundance gradients evident in the stripped material .",
    "the targets for our abundance study are taken from the m - giants catalogued in @xcite .",
    "we selected two samples of stars seen towards the trailing arm of sgr debris that possess radial velocities and distances appropriate for the trailing arm .",
    "the radial velocities of the target sample are shown in figure [ fig : spatial ] .",
    "the two samples at @xmath12 and @xmath13 are shown in figure [ fig : spatial ] in the sgr plane in the context of literature models for the sgr debris @xcite .",
    "as seen in the simulations of @xcite the two regions represent stars lost from the sgr system approximately 0.5 gyr and 1.3 gyr ago respectively .",
    "we have chosen to focus on the trailing arm for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , @xcite show that the leading arm debris is much less spatially differentiated with respect to the epoch at which material was stripped compared with the trailing arm material ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "consequently , stars lost in successive orbits overlap significantly .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity distribution of leading arm stars is less coherent than that seen in the trailing arm ( see @xcite @xcite figure 10 ) . for trailing arm material selection on the basis of radial velocity",
    "is more stringent and contamination from field star interlopers is less likely than that for a corresponding leading arm sample .",
    "table [ table : obslog ] reports the details of our observations .",
    "the spectra of individual stars along the trailing arm of sgr were obtained in the @xmath14-band at a resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the 8 m gemini south telescope and the phoenix spectrograph @xcite in queue mode observing ( program gs-2008b - q-33 ) .",
    "the observations were centred at 1.555 @xmath16 m and utilised the h6420 order separating filter to provide a wavelength coverage of 75 .",
    "the spectra were observed using a 4-pixel slit ( 0.34@xmath17 wide and 14@xmath17 long ) .",
    "each target star was observed at two positions , left and right of the midpoint of the spectrograph slit length , separated by 2.5@xmath17 .",
    "the sky and dark background were removed by subtracting exposures taken at the alternating positions on the detector array . for each night 10",
    "dark and flat frames were also acquired .",
    "a series of spectra of hot stars for telluric line correction were also acquired .",
    "examination of the observed wavelength window reveals only a very few weak telluric features .",
    "the frames were reduced in the iraf environment following a procedure similar to that described in @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite .",
    "dark and flat frames are combined and the resulting dark is subtracted from the flat . a response image was derived from the flat and the science frames were then divided through by this response frame .",
    "the spectra were then extracted and wavelength calibrated using the stellar absorption lines evident .",
    "finally , the spectra corresponding to left and right displacements were combined and continuum normalised .",
    "the reddening to each object is derived from the 100 @xmath16 m galactic map of @xcite and is provided in table [ table : obslog ] .",

    "the effective temperature scale for cool giants is well defined from occulation measurements .",
    "we use the relation of @xcite , namely t@xmath19 = @xmath20 , to derive the temperatures given in table [ table : starpars ] .",
    "surface gravities were derived from interpolation of appropriate low metallicity isochrones @xcite .",

    "we estimate that internal uncertainties in the stellar parameters are @xmath22 , logg @xmath23 @xmath24 0.4 dex , and @xmath25 km s@xmath26 .",
    "abundances for a given line were derived by comparing synthetic spectra with the observed spectra following the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the synthetic spectra were generated using the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) stellar line analysis program moog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* version ) and lte model atmospheres from the marcs grid @xcite .",
    "the line list used in the generation of synthetic spectra was taken from @xcite .",

    "the abundance dependences on the stellar parameters are given in table [ table : abundanceuncertainties ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : feh ] we present our [ fe / h ] determinations for the two sample regions in the upper panel of figure [ fig : feh ] . in the lower panel of figure",
    "[ fig : feh ] we graphically represent the median [ fe / h ] and its interquartile range as a function of angular distance ( @xmath27 as defined in @xcite ) from the main body of sgr .",
    "a two - sided k - s test is used to determine the probability that the stream samples were drawn from the core sample @xcite .",
    "the percentages above each sample in the lower panel of figure [ fig : feh ] show the probability that this is the case .",
    "low values of this probability indicate that the assumption that the stream samples are similar to that of the core is a poor one .",
    "more distant material is seen to be progressively less like the core sample .",
    "a gradient of [ fe / h]=@xmath2 dex / degree is determined from a least - squares fit to the core , @xmath27=66@xmath0 and @xmath27=132@xmath0 samples . at a mean distance of 22 kpc",
    "this projects to @xmath3 dex / kpc .",
    "the target stars have been taken from the study of @xcite and are selected therein on the basis of their 2mass colours as m - giant stars .",
    "the judicious selection of @xcite isolates the upper red giant branch ( rgb ) of sgr with low contamination from the milky way ( mw ) field .",
    "however , it also imposes a bias towards metal - rich stars as detailed in @xcite .",
    "metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath28 dex are essentially excluded due to this colour selection . to minimise the effects of this imposed metallicity bias on our findings ,",
    "the above figures compare our results with literature data that impose identical colour selection of the m - giants .",
    "utilisation of m - giants also imposes an age range to the sample of stars we study .",
    "an m - giant of [ fe / h ] = @xmath29 dex ( typical of the sgr core ; @xcite @xcite ) possesses an age of 22.5 gyr . at lower metallicities an older age",
    "is required to reach the same @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 color ( for example a 1m@xmath33 [ fe / h ] = -0.4 star is 0.1 dex younger than a [ fe / h ] = -0.7 star at @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32=1.0 ; @xcite @xcite ) .    our results may be compared to the metallicity gradient observed in the more extensively studied leading arm material . as noted above , the leading arm is more extensively phased mixed .",
    "that is to say the material lost in successive orbits is not as spatially differentiated as in the trailing arm .",
    "this effect would be expected to reduce the apparent metallicity gradient along the leading arm compared to the trailing arm . in their study of the leading arm m giants , @xcite ,",
    "report the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) in two regions ; one centred at @xmath34 of around 100@xmath0 in extent , and another region at @xmath35 ( proposed to be old leading arm debris displaced @xmath36 from the main body ) .",
    "the mean metallicities are found to be @xmath37 dex and @xmath38 dex respectively .",
    "taken together with the mean metallicity of the core , this equates to a metallicity gradient of @xmath39 dex / degree .",
    "this is compatible with the present results for the trailing arm .",
    "the [ fe / h ] gradient we derive here is also compatible with the mean metallicity determined , again from m - giants , in the sample of @xcite ( marked m07 in figure [ fig : feh ] ) .",
    "further , it is noteworthy that our observed [ fe / h ] gradient continues to the @xcite north galactic cap positive velocity group which is ascribed by @xcite to an old wrap of the trailing arm .",
    "the north galactic cap sample is not used in our determination of the metallicity gradient of the trailing arm since there is possible confusion with other kinematically distinct substructures in the direction of the north galactic cap sample .",
    "the north galactic cap sample occupies an area of the sky in which there is both leading and trailing arm material as well as material from the virgo stellar stream @xcite .",
    "the dynamical models of @xcite predict that while the leading arm material at the position of the north galactic cap sample will possess negative velocities , the trailing material will possess velocities of @xmath40 kms@xmath26 .",
    "the virgo stellar stream material possesses a colder velocity profile centred at @xmath41 kms@xmath26 .",
    "@xcite shows that considerable overlap in radial velocity exists between the two systems and consequently it is not clear how much of the north galactic cap sample is due to the virgo stellar stream .",
    "@xcite finds that the metallicity of the rr lyrae members of the virgo stellar stream are uniformly metal - poor at [ fe / h]@xmath42 . at such low metallicity few objects",
    "would be contributed to the 2mass colour selection discussed above .",
    "however , the rr lyraes of the virgo stellar stream represent the old stellar population and nothing is known of the metallicity distribution of other populations within this halo substructure .",
    "we now discuss the implications of our findings of a metallicity gradient in the stars along the trailing arm of sgr in the context of models of the chemodynamic evolution of sgr .",
    "dynamical models of the tidal disruption of sgr have been presented by numerous authors .",
    "@xcite present models that seek to account for the distance to , and radial velocity of , the m - giants of @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite include further observational constraints from the sdss regarding the distance to the sgr leading arm .",
    "a common feature of these studies is that while they manage to qualitatively match the features of the stream , they do not provide a consistent model for the shape of the milky way s dark matter halo . in particular ,",
    "the leading material is best matched by an oblate halo , whereas the trailing material is best matched by a prolate figure @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that by adopting a triaxial halo model , rather than the axisymetric models assumed in the studies above , a concordant solution is achievable .",
    "however , as @xcite point out the solution is somewhat unsatisfactory since such a configuration is expected to be dynamically unstable .",
    "while the above uncertainties remain in the modelling of the orbit of sgr , the pertinent features for the present study are that stars are released preferentially during perigalactic passage with an orbital period of @xmath43 gyr @xcite .",
    "consequently , our sample at @xmath27=66@xmath0 was lost from sgr on the present perigalactic passage approximately 0.5 gyr ago , and the @xmath27=132@xmath0 sample was lost @xmath44 gyr ago on the previous passage of sgr ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the star formation history of the main body of sgr @xcite have revealed a complex and protracted star formation history with three major phases .",
    "these studies find an old ( 11 gyr ) metal - poor population of [ fe / h ] @xmath45 dex , a dominant intermediate age population ( 64.5 gyr , with possible bursts ) with [ fe / h ] @xmath46 dex and a young ( 23 gyr ) population of [ fe / h ] @xmath47 to @xmath48 dex .",
    "if the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) of sgr was spatially uniform then we would expect our samples of m - giants to possess the metallicity appropriate for their relatively young age ( @xmath123 gyr ) , namely @xmath49 [ fe / h ] @xmath50 dex ( as dominates the core sample ) .",
    "furthermore we would expect a negligible metallicity gradient in the debris stream .",
    "our observations imply that the progenitor of the present - day sgr did not possess a spatially uniform amr .",
    "seen another way , the time between perigalacticons does not allow sufficient time for chemically homogeneous in - situ elevation of the mean [ fe / h ] to the levels we observe between successive orbits .",
    "rather , as recognised by @xcite , the abundance gradient observed must arise due to the stripping of the outer regions of the sgr progenitor over which a metallicity gradient ( and/or concomitant age gradient ) was present .",
    "indeed such population gradients are typically observed in dwarf galaxies . as reviewed by @xcite ,",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies universally show extended envelopes dominated by old rgb stars",
    ". such haloes of old  intermediate age stars are seen across a range of galaxy luminosity and under a range of tidal conditions .",
    "stellar population gradients are notably less distinct amongst the local dsph galaxies .",
    "however , gradients in the morphology of the horizontal branch are not uncommon and are indicative of metallicity and/or age gradients @xcite .",
    "it is plausible therefore , that the original sgr progenitor possessed an extended and correspondingly metallicity segregated , halo consistent with our observations .",
    "as sgr experienced strong tidal interaction with the milky way , the tidal radius of sgr decreased with each successive orbit , leading to the loss of stars from outer regions of the progenitor . in this picture , it is the intermediate age m - stars ( having arisen in perhaps the most recent star formation episode ) of this outer sgr halo population that we see in the tidally disrupted debris tails .",
    "the radial metallicity gradient imprinted by previous chemodynamical evolution gives rise to the metallicity gradient we observe here .",
    "since the stars of the present study are amongst the most recent to form in sgr , the fact that they exhibit a [ fe / h ] gradient requires that the abundance gradient is long - lived , having survived for approximately a hubble time .",
    "moreover , our findings imply that radial mixing of enriched material must be of little significance .",
    "in figures [ fig : tife ] and [ fig : ofe ] we show our findings for [ ti / fe ] and [ o / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "both figures show a characteristic underabundance of o and ti at given [ fe / h ] relative to the stars of the galactic disk and halo .",
    "we recall that the m giants of the present study represent stars of @xmath1 23 gyr ; galactic disk stars of this age reside on the galactic locus ( the solid line in figs .",
    "[ fig : tife ] & [ fig : ofe ] ) at approximately solar metallicity .    figure [ fig : tife_ofe ] shows the interquartile ranges of the offset in [ o , ti / fe ] at given [ fe / h ] between our observed sample and that defined in the galactic disk and halo / fe]@xmath51 - [ @xmath52/fe]@xmath53 , where @xmath52 is the abundance of o or ti . ] as a function of angular distance from sgr .",
    "the probability that each sample is drawn from the core sample is determined by a two - sided k - s test . in the case of both [ o / fe ] and [ ti / fe ]",
    "there is no significant gradient along the trailing arm .",
    "however , a significant spread in [ ti / fe ] is apparent in the four samples in figure [ fig : tife ] .",
    "the spread is much larger than the abundance ratio errors ( the associated abundance ratio errors of the studies of @xcite and @xcite are similar in magnitude to those of the present study ) .",
    "such a spread is not apparent in [ o / fe ] , shown in figure [ fig : ofe ] . the origin of this spread in [ ti / fe ] is not understood .",
    "our study does not however , enable us to define the [ fe / h ] of the [ o / fe ] or [ ti / fe ] ` knee ' .",
    "this is due to the inherent metal - rich bias in our use of m - giants ( as discussed above ) and small sample size .",
    "consequently , we do not constrain the expected metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath54 dex ) [ o / fe ] plateau .",
    "chemical evolution models of @xcite show that the progressively lower sf efficiency should lead to a [ @xmath4/fe ] plateau at progressively lower [ @xmath4/fe ] at increasing @xmath27 .",
    "abundances of radial - velocity selected k - giants ( representative of the metal - poor population ) in the trailing arm would enable clarification of the location of the ` knee ' in the [ @xmath4/fe ] relation , or otherwise , of a chemical gradient in the trailing arm material .",
    "our observations of the @xmath4-element o and the @xmath4-like element ti , show that the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratio of sgr material is lower at a given [ fe / h ] compared with that of the mw ( at least for [ fe / h ] @xmath55 dex material probed to date ) . as described in a large literature of chemical evolution models",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the generally lower [ @xmath4/fe ] is a consequence of slower chemical enrichment in lower mass systems .",
    "the slower pace of chemical enrichment ( due to lower star formation efficiency and/or stronger galactic winds ) allows fe - rich snia products to be incorporated at lower metallicities relative to the mw halo .",
    "the [ fe / h ] of the [ @xmath4/fe ] ` knee ' feature , seen in the mw halo at a [ fe / h ] @xmath56 dex , provides a snapshot of the metallicity at @xmath57 gyr , after which time snia begin to appreciably raise the fe content and reduce [ @xmath4/fe ] .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , and demonstrated by @xcite in the sgr leading arm , for [ @xmath4/fe ] @xmath58 dex there is a general overlap in the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratio of mw and sgr stars .",
    "this indicates a common dominance of snii enrichment at these metallicities . for [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath59 dex however , the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratio of sgr material is significantly below that the of the mw .",
    "this possibly reflects a lower early star formation rate ( sfr ) in sgr compared to the mw , or as proposed by @xcite , that sgr exhibited a moderate star formation ( sf ) efficiency at first , but one that was quenched by galactic winds from ensuing snii .",
    "the implications of the evolution of [ @xmath4/fe ] in sgr can be contrasted with those in the lmc . in the lmc",
    "the [ ti / fe ] and [ o / fe ] ratio remains lower that the mw at all metallicities probed to date ( [ fe / h]@xmath60 - 1.3 @xcite .",
    "this is ascribed to a sf efficiency lower than that of sgr and/or more efficient galactic winds ( discussed in the context of [ o / fe ] by @xcite & @xcite ) and the presence of fewer contributing high - mass snii ( from [ ti / fe ] , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite therefore point out that the early chemical evolution of sgr was more akin to that of the mw than that of the lmc and the local dsphs .",
    "they propose that the progenitor of sgr was most likely a gas - rich , star forming galaxy that was substantially more massive that the extant remnant .",
    "the @xcite results amplify this argument .",
    "the study of @xcite defines a sequence of relative sfr in early galaxy evolution that ranges from the dsphs which exhibit the lowest sfr , to the lmc with a moderate sfr , and finally sgr with the highest sfr evident amongst the mw satellites .",
    "thus the advanced chemical evolution of sgr material argues strongly that the progenitor was more massive that the lmc .",
    "however , at present the dynamical models of @xcite assume a progenitor mass of 25@xmath6110@xmath62m@xmath33 compared to the lmc mass of 12@xmath6110@xmath63m@xmath33 .",
    "an increase in the progenitor mass of sgr would imply a more extended history of mass - loss to the mw and an enhanced impact on the chemistry of the halo .",
    "we also note that a large mass progenitor would be in line with the observed extended sfh of sgr that indicates that sgr was actively forming stars until 12 gyr ago ( * ? ? ?",
    "* indeed if it had not , there would be no m giants with which to trace the tidal streams ) although it has been tidally interacting with the mw for @xmath64 gyr ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "the ability to retain the gas required for such star formation in the face of galactic tidal interaction would argue for a large progenitor mass .      an important role is expected for accreted satellites in the formation of the galactic halo within lambda - cdm cosmology . here hierarchical mergers lead to massive galaxies surrounded by a flotilla of lower mass satellite halos ( at least as traced by dark matter - only simulations ) .",
    "hence , the stellar content of the halo must presumably contain some contribution from the disruption of such satellites .",
    "a number of observational challenges to such a scenario have arisen .",
    "firstly , the number of lower mass halos observed about the mw was found to be low compared to predictions of cosmological simulations ( the so - called ` missing satellite problem ' @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent searches have revealed increased numbers of extremely faint dsphs @xcite . when considered together with survey selection effects , the shortfall of local dsphs is substantially ameliorated @xcite .",
    "secondly , amongst metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h @xmath65 dex ) the mdf and chemistry of the galactic halo were seen to be very different to those exhibited by dsphs @xcite .",
    "for example , the metal - poor tail of the mdf in dsphs was seen to be deficient compared to that of the halo @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent studies of @xcite do not uphold this deficiency .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite conclude that the mdf of dsphs and the halo are in good agreement .",
    "furthermore , evidence now shows that the extremely metal - poor stars in dsphs show similar [ @xmath4/fe ] to the halo @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that present - day dsphs could have contributed to the metal - poor halo .",
    "however , divergent chemistry remains at higher metallicity . for [ fe / h]@xmath66 ,",
    "the [ @xmath4/fe ] of the dsph sample is uniformly , and significantly , lower than that of the halo .",
    "only sgr , thought to be ( in the form of its progenitor ) the most massive of the local dwarf galaxies , has some stars with [ @xmath4/fe ] similar to the halo at intermediate metallicities .",
    "signature of slow chemical enrichment , the [ @xmath4/fe ] of an average low - mass dsph implies that such systems can not be responsible for a substantial fraction of the metal - poor halo .    in order to explain the halo chemistry ,",
    "it is necessary to capture [ fe / h ] @xmath67 and @xmath4-enhanced material .",
    "one mechanism to introduce such material is from a number of massive satellites that experienced rapid star formation and were then accreted rapidly , before the onset of snia contributions @xcite .",
    "@xcite make a clear distinction between ` building block ' satellites ( i.e.  those that are accreted ) and surviving satellites . from cosmological simulations",
    ", they find that building blocks collapse and form stars earlier than surviving satellites that instead form stars in a quiescent manner .",
    "@xcite finds that the merger of less than five massive ( @xmath68 m@xmath33 ) ` building blocks ' at early times ( @xmath69 ) can account for the galactic halo .",
    "our findings show that the chemistry of the stars contributed by sgr to the galactic halo in the trailing arm debris are significantly different from that of the halo at similar [ fe / h ] .",
    "therefore sgr is not a ` building block ' .",
    "the debris are increasingly metal - poor further from the mainbody of sgr and so , in terms of the [ fe / h ] the material is increasingly ` halo - like ' .",
    "however , we see no signs of convergence between the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratio in stars of the trailing arm and stars of similar [ fe / h ] from the galactic halo .",
    "consequently , our findings show that the fraction of the intermediate  metal - rich halo population that can have been contributed by the dissolution of sgr - like objects over the last several gyr can not be substantial .",
    "in this study we have presented the abundance analysis of eleven m - giant stars in two regions along the trailing arm of the sgr dwarf .",
    "the two populations , together with existing data from the literature , enable us to explore the metallicity and chemistry of stars deposited into the milky way halo from sgr over the past @xmath44 gyr .",
    "within our limited sample of @xmath123 gyr old stars , we find a significant gradient in metallicity along the debris stream .",
    "the metallicity gradient is @xmath70 dex / degree ( @xmath3 dex / kpc ) decreasing away from the main body of sgr . the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratio at a given metallicity is seen to be approximately constant along the extent of the trailing arm .",
    "the change in metallicity along the stream can be understood to be due to the tidal disruption of a sgr progenitor that possessed a radial gradient in [ fe / h ] . such a gradient could have arisen due to a radial decrease in the star formation efficiency and/or a radial increase in the efficiency of galactic wind - driven metal loss . the physical mechanism that produced a radial [ fe / h ] gradient that persisted over a hubble time did",
    "not , however , produce a detectable gradient in [ @xmath4/fe ] .",
    "there is no significant [ @xmath4/fe ] gradient along the trailing arm from our sample of m - giants .",
