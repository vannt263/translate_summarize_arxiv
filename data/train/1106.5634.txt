    "knot polynomials like the jones polynomial or the homfly polynomial are very good at detecting chirality . as the conway polynomials of a knot and its mirror image are the same , at first glance the conway polynomial seems to be less powerful .",
    "nonetheless , the conway polynomial was known to satisfy some interesting properties : if a knot is achiral , then its determinant is a sum of squares ( @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "if we assume that the achiral knot @xmath3 is alternating then the leading coefficient @xmath4 is , up to sign , a square of an integer ( @xcite , s ) .",
    "kawauchi ( @xcite ) conjectured for arbitrary achiral knots :    the conway polynomial @xmath0 of an achiral knot has the splitting property , i.e. @xmath1 for a polynomial @xmath2 with integer coefficients .",
    "hartley and kawauchi established in @xcite this conjecture for strongly @xmath5achiral knots and for two - bridged knots .",
    "later hartley ( @xcite ) showed that the conjecture holds for arbitrary @xmath6achiral knots .",
    "the kawauchi conjecture was also verified for all prime achiral knots of @xmath716 crossings ( see remark 4.3 in @xcite ) and for a large class of hyperbolic achiral knots tested in @xcite . despite these results ,",
    "we show that the kawauchi conjecture is not true . + in section 2",
    ", we give a counterexample to the kawauchi conjecture .",
    "this counterexample is an alternating @xmath8achiral knot of order 4 ( theorem 2.2 ) .",
    "+ in section 3 , we will show how the conway polynomial of an alternating achiral knot can be related to the decomposition of the knot into its arborescent and polyhedral parts . for this purpose we will use the decomposition of a knot projection into jewels and twisted band diagrams by haseman ( conway ) circles , as described by bonahon - siebenmann . in the appendix we recall the main lines of that decomposition which is carried out in detail in ( @xcite and @xcite ) : to each alternating knot @xmath3 we associate its * structure tree * @xmath9 : if @xmath3 is achiral , the symmetry induces an automorphism @xmath10 on its structure tree @xmath9 which has exactly one fixed point ( @xcite ) .",
    "an achiral alternating knot @xmath3 is * quasi - polyhedral * if the fixed point of @xmath11 is either a jewel or a haseman circle adjacent to two jewels .",

    "we show that achiral quasi - arborescent knots always satisfy the splitting property ( theorem 3.3 ) .",
    "hence counterexamples such as the one given in section 2 belong to the class of quasi - polyhedral knots .",
    "more generally one can be interested in non - necessarily alternating knots and raise the question : what is among such knots , the nature of counterexamples to kawauchi conjecture .",
    "let us recall the definitions of @xmath12 achirality of knots .",
    "a knot @xmath3 is _ achiral _ if there is a diffeomorphism @xmath13 of @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath13 reverses the orientation of @xmath14 .",

    "assume that char@xmath17 @xmath19 . to be even is equivalent to having only monomials of even order .",
    "let @xmath20 $ ] be even .",
    "if we substitute @xmath21 for @xmath22 in its decomposition in irreducible elements , we see that this decomposition must be ( up to a unit of @xmath17 ) as follows : @xmath23 where : + 1 ) the polynomials @xmath24 and @xmath25 are irreducible ; + 2 ) @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 if @xmath29 ; + 3 ) the polynomials @xmath24 are even and @xmath25 non even .",
    "+ it is known that the conway polynomial of a knot @xmath30 is even with constant term equal to @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence one has the following proposition .",
    "the conway polynomial @xmath0 of a knot satisfies the kawauchi conjecture if and only if all the exponents @xmath32 in its decomposition into irreducible factors are even .          [ figure 1 ]    there exists an alternating achiral knot @xmath3 in @xmath14 such that its conway polynomial is equal to : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath16 is irreducible over @xmath35 .",
    "once the irreducibility of @xmath16 is established , the knot @xmath3 is clearly a counterexample to the kawauchi conjecture .",
    "\\1 ) let us consider the alternating knot @xmath3 pictured in figure 1 .",
    "it is rather easy to realize that @xmath3 is positively achiral ( the alternating projection of @xmath3 is invariant by a rotatory reflection of order 4 ) . by knotscape ,",
    "its conway polynomial is :    @xmath36 2 ) it remains to show that the polynomial @xmath37 is irreducible over @xmath35 .",

    "this decomposition gives information on the possible irreducible factors of @xmath16 , from which we can deduce that @xmath16 is indeed irreducible over @xmath35 .",
    "on @xmath38 the polynomial @xmath16 is equal to : @xmath39 it is easy to see that over @xmath38 :    @xmath40 + where @xmath41 is irreducible over @xmath38 . + hence @xmath16 either is irreducible or decomposes as a product @xmath42 where @xmath43 is irreducible non even and with reduction modulo 3 equal to @xmath44 .",
    "we show that the latter case does not occur .",
    "+ write @xmath45 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath42 with @xmath16 produces the following equations for @xmath46 : @xmath47 a little computation shows that the coefficients @xmath46 are all divisible by 4 .",

    "+ then the equations ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) give rise to the following equations : @xmath51 + the equation ( 2.6 ) implies that @xmath52 is even and hence this contradicts ( 2.5 ) .",

    "let us consider the arborescent knot which has its weighted planar tree depicted in figure 2 .",
    "one can show that its conway polynomial is equal to : @xmath56 + the proof is done by induction .",
    "\\2 ) the fact that a knot is alternating is reflected in the alternating form of its alexander polynomial ( another version of the conway polynomial ) : all of its coefficients are non zero and alternate in signs .",
    "however there exist alternating alexander polynomials which are not associated to an alternating knot ( @xcite ) + 3 ) it is not known whether there is an achiral knot associated to each conway polynomial satisfying the splitting property .",
