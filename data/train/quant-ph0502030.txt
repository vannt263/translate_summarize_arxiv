    "_ oblivious transfer _  @xcite , _ ot _ for short , is a functionality of great importance  @xcite in cryptography or , more precisely , _ secure two - party computation _",
    ", where two parties , who mutually distrust each other , want to collaborate with the objective of achieving a common goal , e.g. , evaluate a function to which both hold an input|but without revealing unnecessary information about the latter . in ( chosen one - out - of - two bit ) ot , one of the parties , the _ sender _ , inputs two bits @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whereas the other party has a _ choice _ bit @xmath2 .",
    "the latter then learns @xmath3 , but remains ignorant about the other message bit @xmath4 .",
    "the sender , on the other hand , does not learn any information about @xmath2 .    various ways , based on public - key encryption , for instance , have been proposed for realizing ot , where the security for one of the parties , however , is only computational .",
    "in fact , oblivious transfer is impossible to achieve in an unconditionally secure way for both parties|even when they are connected by a quantum channel  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that unconditionally secure ot can be reduced to weak information - theoretic primitives such as simply a noisy communication channel  @xcite , @xcite or so - called _ universal ot _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a recent result  @xcite shows that ot can be stored : given one realization of ot , a sample of distributed random variables @xmath5 ( known to @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( known to @xmath8 ) can be generated , where the joint distribution @xmath9 is such that @xmath5 and @xmath7 can be used to realize an instance of ot .",
    "we will call the distributed pair of random variables @xmath10 an _ oblivious key _ or ok for short ; in some sense , as we will see , this is the _ local _ ( hidden - variable ) part of ot ( as opposed to non - local systems and behavior , see section  1.2 ) .",
    "another consequence|observed in  @xcite|is that , since ok is symmetric , ot is , too .",
    "this solved a long - standing open problem posed in  @xcite .",
    "_ entangled _ but possibly distant two - partite quantum systems can show a joint behavior under measurements that can not be explained by `` locality '' or hidden variables , i.e. , distributed classical information ; such behavior is called _ non - local_. there exists , for instance , a so - called _ maximally entangled _",
    "state @xmath11 with the following properties .",
    "if the parties @xmath6 and @xmath8 controlling the two parts of the system both choose between two fixed possible bases for measuring their system in ( where this pair of bases is not the same for the two parties ) , where the measurement outcome can be @xmath12 or @xmath13 in both cases , then the following statistics are observed .",
    "( here , the two possible bases for each party are called @xmath12 and @xmath13 , too . ) @xmath14\\ \\ = \\ \\ 0\\ , \\\\ p_{01 } & : = & { \\rm prob\\ , } [ \\ , \\mbox{outcome $ a$}=\\mbox{outcome $ b$}\\ , |\\ , \\mbox{basis $ a$}=0\\ , , \\",

    "more precisely , the so - called chsh _ bell inequality _ is violated since @xmath15 holds .",
    "it is , on the other hand , important to note that this non - local behavior is `` weaker '' that communication between @xmath6 and @xmath8 and does not allow for such|fortunately , since such a possibility would be in contradiction with relativity .    with the objective of achieving a better understanding of such `` non - local behavior , '' popescu and",
    "rohrlich  @xcite defined a `` non - locality primitive '' behaving in a similar way , but where the probabilities @xmath16 are @xmath17 in other words , both parties have an input bit ( corresponding to the choice of the basis in the quantum model ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 and get an output bit @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath5 and @xmath7 are random bits satisfying @xmath20 it is important to note , however , that the behavior of this `` pr primitive '' can not , although it does not allow for communication either , be obtained from any quantum state|it violates a `` quantum bell inequality '' that is even valid for the behavior of quantum states . on the other hand , the primitive _",
    "does _ allow for perfectly simulating the behavior of a maximally entangled quantum bit pair under _ any _ possible measurement  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been shown possible , for instance , also between parties who may communicate _",
    "one _ classical bit  @xcite @xcite , but the possibility of achieving the same with the pr primitive is of particular interest since this functionality does not allow for any communication .",
    "the three _ information - theoretic primitives _ or two - party functionalities described in the previous sections can be modeled by their mutual input - output behavior , i.e. , by a conditional probability distribution @xmath21 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 are the two parties input and output , respectively ( see figure  1 ) .",
