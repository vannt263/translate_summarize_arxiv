    "significant theoretical activity , aimed at understanding the properties of matter under extreme conditions , has been triggered recently by the heavy - ion collision experiments conducted at rhic and the lhc , in which the deconfined phase of qcd matter , the quark - gluon plasma , is created .",
    "the transition from the hadronic to the deconfined , partonic phase is an analytic crossover at zero baryo - chemical potential @xmath0  @xcite with a transition temperature @xmath1 determined in lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "this crossover feature also extends to small values of @xmath0 .",
    "the possibility that the transition becomes first - order for larger @xmath0 , which would imply the existence of a critical point , is currently investigated by the beam energy scan program at rhic , soon to be followed by the cbm experiment at fair .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of the net - electric charge and net - baryon number , which are conserved charges of qcd , are expected to become large near a critical point  @xcite : for this reason , they have been proposed as ideal observables to verify its existence and to determine its position in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "experimental results for these measures were recently reported for several collision energies  @xcite .",
    "in addition , as a consequence of the increasing precision achieved in the numerical simulations , it is becoming possible to extract the chemical freeze - out parameters ( i.e. freeze - out temperature @xmath2 and corresponding baryo - chemical potential @xmath3 ) from first principles , by comparing the measured fluctuation observables to corresponding susceptibility ratios calculated in lattice qcd  @xcite . when compared to experimental data from heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "present lattice simulations have , however , their limitations : they can not take the experimental acceptance cuts into account and they are available only for small chemical potentials . as a consequence of the latter , only the lowest order susceptibilities are available on the lattice at finite @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the experimental restriction of net - baryon to net - proton number measurements can not be realized on the lattice .",
    "recently , fluctuation observables have been investigated in transport approaches  @xcite as well as in various baseline studies within the hrg model  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the hrg model in chemical equilibrium reproduce the equilibrium lattice qcd results for the susceptibilities and their ratios in the hadronic phase reasonably well  @xcite . furthermore , the model allows to expand the range of @xmath0-values and consequently to calculate ratios of higher order susceptibilities at finite @xmath0 , as well as to implement kinematic acceptance cuts in rapidity @xmath4 , pseudo - rapidity @xmath5 and transverse momentum @xmath6 , thus , providing a valuable tool to extract the freeze - out conditions from the experimental data . in the past , statistical hadronization models ( shms ) have been used to analyze experimental data on particle production by comparing the data to thermal abundances calculated in hrg model approaches for all collision energies ranging from ags to the lhc , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the freeze - out temperatures determined in this way lie , however , at the upper limit of the uncertainty band of the lattice qcd results for @xmath1  @xcite , which is most pronounced for the highest collision energies .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate ratios of susceptibilities quantifying fluctuations in the number of net protons and in the net - electric charge within the hrg model : our study includes the effects of resonance decays and isospin randomization for the nucleons , as well as kinematic acceptance cuts in agreement with the experimental analysis .",
    "we extract new freeze - out points in the ( @xmath7)-plane of qcd matter and compare them with the freeze - out curve determined in ref .",
    "finally , we discuss the issue of the consistency between the freeze - out parameters obtained from the analysis of net - electric charge and net - proton fluctuations .",
    "we find that it is possible to use a combined analysis of the lowest - order cumulants of the net - electric charge and the net - proton distributions in order to extract common freeze - out conditions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "possible limitations of this method are addressed .",
    "the hrg model provides a suitable description of the bulk properties of hadronic matter in thermal and chemical equilibrium , see e.g.  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit , the pressure as a function of temperature @xmath8 and all hadron chemical potentials @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 \\",

    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the respective quantum numbers of baryon charge , electric charge and strangeness , while @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the chemical potentials associated with the net densities of baryon number , @xmath20 , electric charge , @xmath21 , and strangeness , @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the particle number density @xmath23 of species @xmath11 follows from the thermodynamic identity @xmath24 as @xmath25 so that the above net densities are given by @xmath26 for @xmath27 .    the actual conditions present in a heavy - ion collision are , however , more complex : first , the chemical potentials @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not independent , but related to @xmath8 as well as to each other via the conditions @xmath28 here , the factor @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ conditions ] ) accounts approximately for the ratio of protons to baryons in the colliding nuclei , while @xmath30 reflects the initial net - strangeness content .",
    "second , during its expansion the created matter does not maintain chemical equilibrium , since the time scales for the necessary inelastic scatterings among the hadrons are typically much longer than the duration of the hadronic stage  @xcite .",
    "while hadrons are assumed to be formed in chemical equilibrium at the transition temperature @xmath1 , for not too small temperatures @xmath31 only the particle - number preserving interactions mediated by hadronic resonance decay and regeneration ( e.g. @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 etc ) continue to occur with sufficient rate .",
    "the hadronic matter is , therefore , in a state of partial chemical equilibrium  @xcite , because the resonances are still in chemical equilibrium with their decay products , whereas the multiplicity ratios of hadrons , which are stable against strong decay during the hadronic stage , are frozen out at @xmath2",
    ". the chemical potentials of the resonances @xmath35 become functions of the chemical potentials of all stable hadrons @xmath36 via @xmath37 and , consequently , the final particle number of a hadron species @xmath36 is given by @xmath38 , where the sum runs over all @xmath35 decaying into @xmath36 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the primordial particle numbers of @xmath36 and @xmath35 , and @xmath41 gives the average number of @xmath36 produced in the decay of @xmath35 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this connection can easily be extended toward higher - order susceptibilities in order to study the average influence of resonance decays on the fluctuations in the final particle numbers .    in this paper",
    "we consider , in line with ref .",
    "@xcite , a hrg model containing states up to a mass of @xmath42  gev as , for example , listed in the particle data book  @xcite .",
    "we consider as stable particles the mesons @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath5 and the baryons @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 as well as their corresponding anti - baryons .",
    "this implies that , as in the experimental analysis , feed - down from weak decays is explicitly excluded in our approach .",
    "when applying the experimental acceptance cuts , we modify the hrg model integrals in the following way : @xmath58}{(-1)^{b_k+1}+\\exp({(\\sqrt{p_t^{\\,2}{\\rm cosh}[\\eta]^2+m_k^2}-\\mu_k)/t } )     } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in the case of cuts on the pseudo - rapidity @xmath5 ( for net - electric charge , i.e. for all charged particles ) and @xmath59}{(-1)^{b_k+1}+\\exp({({\\rm cosh}[y]\\sqrt{p_t^{\\,2}+m_k^2}-\\mu_k)/t})}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in the case of cuts on the rapidity @xmath4 ( for net protons ) . due to the setup of the hrg model",
    ", we can only apply cuts on the momenta of the primordial resonances and of the primordial stable hadrons , but not on those of the products of resonance decays .",
    "it has , however , been estimated that the effect of acceptance cuts in rapidity on the decay daughters should be in the percent range  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the effect of radial flow on the measured particle species in a limited transverse momentum range , which might have been particularly important for the net charge since there a composite of particle species with different mass is considered , has been estimated taking into account the blastwave parameters extracted by star , and found to be negligible due to the rather wide @xmath6-window of the measurement ( 0.2 - 2 gev / c ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with a similar previous study  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we compare our hrg model calculations with the efficiency corrected experimental results for the most central collisions ( @xmath60 ) published by the star collaboration for net - proton ) for net - protons can be found on the public star webpage . ]",
    "@xcite and net - electric charge fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the susceptibilities of conserved charges are defined as @xmath61 their relationship with the central moments of the conserved charge multiplicity distributions is @xmath62 where @xmath63 . from the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ cenmom ] ) the following , to leading order volume - independent , ratios can be defined : @xmath64    we calculate the net - proton fluctuations according to the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where besides kinematic acceptance cuts also resonance decays and regeneration below the chemical freeze - out are taken into account . while resonance decays feed the distributions of the primordial protons and anti - protons , the regeneration of resonances leads to a randomization of the nucleon isospin : the dominant process is the regeneration of @xmath65-resonances from the scatterings of nucleons with thermal pions .",
    "subsequently , these @xmath66-resonances decay into either the same or the opposite isospin state , where neutrons are , however , not detected experimentally .",
    "consequently , additional fluctuations in the net - proton number arise , which we include based on the formalism by kitazawa and asakawa ( ka )  @xcite .",
    "net - electric charge fluctuations are calculated based on the most abundant charged particles , namely pions , kaons , and protons as well as their anti - particles . also here , primordial distributions are fed by resonance decays , but corrections similar to the ka - corrections for the net - proton number are not needed , because processes via intermediate resonances conserve electric charge .    while the application of the experimental acceptance cuts is straightforward in the net - proton case ( where @xmath29  gev / c  @xmath67  gev / c and @xmath68 ) , it is more difficult in the case of net - electric charge . here , the general cuts are @xmath69  gev / c",
    "@xmath70  gev / c and @xmath71 , but in order to suppress spallation protons , all protons ( and anti - protons ) with @xmath72  gev / c are removed in the experimental analysis . due to correlated resonance decay contributions to ( anti-)protons and pions or kaons , e.g. @xmath73 or @xmath74 , which are given by a single integral in the hrg model calculation , we can not cut the resonance contribution to the ( anti-)protons in the same way without also affecting the contributions to the pions and kaons .",
    "we thus apply the lower @xmath6-cut of @xmath29  gev / c only to the primordial protons and anti - protons .    in order to extract the freeze - out temperature and baryo - chemical potential for each collision energy , we have simultaneously analyzed two experimentally measured susceptibility ratios . with the resulting freeze - out conditions ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) we can calculate the remaining susceptibility ratios , which gives us a cross - check on the reliability of the determined freeze - out parameters .",
    "the large experimental uncertainties in the higher - order susceptibility ratios of the net - electric charge @xmath77 and @xmath78 do not allow to meaningfully constrain the freeze - out temperature and baryo - chemical potential from net - electric charge fluctuations alone .",
    "moreover , for the net protons , as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not possible to simultaneously reproduce @xmath79 and @xmath80 for all beam energies : this might point at a limitation in our approach , for example , due to an overestimate of the ka - corrections , which maximize the impact of isospin randomization .",
    "several other effects that might impact the higher order moments have also not yet been considered , such as volume fluctuations @xcite , exact ( local ) charge conservation @xcite or repulsive van - der - walls forces among hadrons @xcite .",
    "finally , the discrepancy in particular at larger @xmath0 , could also hint at the onset of chiral critical fluctuations in the higher moments ( skewness and above )  @xcite .",
    "we therefore perform , first , a combined analysis of the ratios with the smallest experimental uncertainty , namely @xmath79 for net - electric charge and for net protons . in addition , we consider an alternative analysis using higher - order cumulants , namely @xmath79 for net - electric charge and @xmath80 for net protons , and discuss the difference in the extracted freeze - out parameters between these two choices .",
