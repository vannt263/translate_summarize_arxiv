    "the science of double - beta decay has been described in detail in a number of good review articles @xcite .",
    "in addition , these proceedings contain a lot of more current information on this rich and exciting field .",
    "previous experimental results are summarized in ref.@xcite , and the theoretical situation concerning the matrix elements is summarized in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we just list the very impressive experimental accomplishments to date in table [ tab : zeronuresults ] .    in this article , we describe the issues facing the  experimental program of the future .",
    "table [ tab : zeronuproj ] lists the active proposals for the future projects of which the author is aware .",
    "it presents an amazing variety of experimental techniques and expertise and is a tribute to the skill and ingenuity of the scientists involved .",
    "many of these projects are well underway and many others have vigorous research programs , hence , the situation is extremely encouraging .",
    "while issues specific to a given project are described in other articles within these proceedings , there are numerous issues that are common to all these projects and it is these issues that are the focus of this article .",
    ".a summary of the recent  results .",
    "the   limits are those deduced by the authors .",
    "all limits are at 90% confidence level unless otherwise indicated .",
    "the columns providing the exposure and background are based on arithmetic done by the author of this paper , who takes responsibility for any errors in interpreting data from the original sources . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : decisiontree ] shows a flow chart indicating possible outcomes of future experiments and what they indicate for the future path of the overall  program .",
    "after the current generation of experiments ( 100 - 200 kg ) are complete , there will be a decision point regarding the following generation .",
    "if these experiments are null , then it will be necessary to build experiments with a ton of isotope to search for a signal at the atmospheric scale .",
    "alternatively , if the experiments see a signal , there is different choice to make depending on the precision of the result .",
    "if the result is not a precision result ( @xmath110% ) , then an expansion to the 1-ton scale is again warranted .",
    "otherwise , if the result is a precision result , a follow - up experiment to measure the statistical distributions of kinematic parameters would be desired . because the experimental design for measuring kinematic parameters may not be congruent with a simple scale up for a search experiment , planners will have to decide which direction to proceed after the current experiments are completed .    to reach a sensitivity at the solar scale , an experiment with 100 tons of isotope",
    "will be required .",
    "such an experiment is not yet feasible for numerous reasons .",
    "enrichment costs and production rates are not presently practical .",
    "achieving the required excellent energy resolution ( better than 1% ) in such a large experiment is also daunting .",
    "schemes involving @xmath2 solid state detectors are conceivable , but costs would need to be greatly reduced to make that number of detectors affordable .",
    "encouragingly , large multi - element detector electronics are improving and would not likely be a show - stopper .",
    "alternatively , large volume detectors using metal - loaded liquid scintillator or xe scale more easily and cost effectively .",
    "however , the energy resolution of such detectors is still too poor for this application .",
    "significant research will be required on these technical difficulties if such an experiment is to be realized .",
    "a cartoon of a decision tree for how the  program should proceed after the currently proposed generation of experiments . ]",
    "if  is observed , we will want to extract all the underlying physics .",
    "the existence of the process would imply that neutrinos have a majorana mass , but it does nt necessarily mean that light neutrinos mediate the decay .",
    "other possibilities include heavy neutrino exchange and r - pairity violating super - symmetry particle exchange .",
    "see ref . @xcite and references therein for a discussion of alternative decay mechanisms .",
    "the matrix elements , however , are different for differing processes and this leads to a possible technique for isolating the dominate one . by comparing  rates in several isotopes",
    "one might be able to identify the underlying physics .",
    "if one uses the present theoretical values for the matrix elements as a guide , it appears that 3 or more experiments , each with a total uncertainty ( theory , statistical , systematic ) of less than about 40% will be required .",
    "the linear combination of the neutrino mass eigenstates ( @xmath3 ) that mix to form the weak interaction eigenstates ( @xmath4 ) is given by a mixing matrix , @xmath5 .",
    "this matrix may contain as many as 3 physically meaningful phases , two of which ( the majorana phases @xmath6 ) contribute to the effective double - beta decay mass ( ) .",
    "these phases do not contribute to the effective beta decay mass ( ) or the differences in the squares of the neutrino masses ( ) as measured in oscillation experiments .",
    "if @xmath7 , then both phases contribute to  and since no other experiment has been identified that is sensitive to the phases , there will be an ambiguity in trying to extract the phase values .",
    "you ca nt deduce two parameters from one data point .",
    "however , if @xmath8 , only one of the majorana phases contribute to  and it could , in principle be extracted . to show this we compare measurements of , , and  for a toy model .",
    "figure [ fig : m1m2plot ] was drawn for @xmath9 mev ,  = ( 9 mev)@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 = 2.5 radians .",
    "these result in  = 300 mev and = 171 mev .",
    "note that the 3 measured parameters are all plotted as functions of the mass eigenvalues and they agree at only one point and then only if the correct value for @xmath13 is chosen .",
    "however , to determine the value of the phase with any precision requires great accuracy on .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows  as a function of the value of the phase for the above toy model .",
    "its clear that if the uncertainty on  is 50% , no information regarding @xmath14 is obtained . for a useful determination of the phase , even in this simplistic two - flavor model , a precision nearing 10% is required .",
    "note that a similar analysis can be found in reference @xcite and a three - neutrino - species example is presented in reference @xcite .",
    "for the same parameters as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1m2plot ] , a plot of  as a function of the majorana phase . ]    for the same parameters as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1m2plot ] , a plot of  as a function of the majorana phase . ]",
    "this is a very exciting time for .",
    "the experimental program is poised to make great strides into a region that will greatly impact neutrino physics .",
    "since neutrino oscillations imply that neutrinos have mass , even null  experiments will constrain the possible neutrino mass spectra . if one sees  in the upcoming experiments",
    ", the qualitative physics conclusion will be extremely exciting .",
    "however , to fully understand all the underlying physics , precision measurements in several nuclei will be needed .",
