    "recent progress in experimental techniques has made it possible to investigate the properties of gases of bosonic atoms in traps at temperatures lower than that required to achieve bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , as well as the properties of fermionic atoms at temperatures lower than the fermi temperature .",
    "when the density of a homogeneous gas is small enough perturbation theory can be applied and the equation of state of repulsive bosons and two - component fermions can be expressed in terms of the expansion parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the density and @xmath2 is the @xmath3-wave scattering length . the problem of a cold trapped gas is more difficult as another parameter , the harmonic oscillator length @xmath4 , enters into the problem .",
    "although many properties of a homogeneous system ( equation of state , _ etc . _ ) can be predicted quite easily , no exact solutions in the presence of an external potential are generally known .",
    "if the number of particles is sufficiently large and the energy per particle is much larger than the level spacing of the harmonic oscillator , one can apply the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "this method is commonly and successfully used to relate properties of an inhomogeneous system to the ones of the corresponding homogeneous system . in this way the predictions of known homogeneous theory can be tested experimentally in confined systems .",
    "alternatively , the problem can be seen from the other side .",
    "it might happen that it is possible to observe and investigate properties of a trapped system in an experiment , while an analytical description of the same physical system is not known even for a homogeneous case .",
    "then the experimental study of a trapped system might shed light on the properties of a homogeneous system and allow us to judge the validity of the analytical approaches .",
    "for example , this is the case with the two - component fermi gas in the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the unitarity regime was already observed in experiments ( see , for example , @xcite ) , while there is a lack of a well - posed and complete theory .",
    "another intriguing question is presence or absence of the lee - yang term , corresponding to a beyond mean field term of composite bosons , in the equation of state on the bec side where formation of molecules was observed @xcite .",
    "this problem is still an open question and there is no conclusive theoretical answer",
    ". a high precision experiment might resolve the question .",
    "the aim of the current work is to investigate how the expansion of the equation of state of a homogeneous system shows up in properties of a trapped system . in order to do",
    "so we assume that the equation of state of a homogeneous gas can be written as as series expansion in some limit .",
    "the local density approximation is used to obtain measurable energetic and spatial properties of a trapped system as a function of the parameters of the expansion and lda parameter .",
    "special attention is paid to the prediction of the frequencies of collective oscillations , as a sensitive experimental tool for investigation of the equation of state .",
    "scaling and sum - rule approaches are used for deriving the frequencies of small collective oscillations .",
    "the derived formalism is applied to dilute bose and fermi gases in different dimensions and to integrable one - dimensional models .",
    "we discuss the physical meaning of expansion terms in a number of systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ seclda ]",
    "we explain the local density approximation in an arbitrary number of dimensions and introduce dimensionless units . in sec .",
    "[ secsolution ] we introduce the `` perturbative '' equation of state and solve the local density approximation problem .",
    "explicit expressions for the chemical potential , energy , release energy , size and density profile of a trapped gas are obtained . in sec .",
    "[ secfreq ] we use scaling and sum - rule approaches for the prediction of the frequencies of collective oscillations .",
    "cases of spherical , elongated , `` cigar''- and `` pancake''- shaped traps are considered .",
    "formulas are derived for three- , two- and one- dimensional traps .",
    "the lda is applied to relate the `` perturbative '' equation of state to frequencies of the breathing mode . in sec .",
    "[ secdiscussion ] we apply the developed formalism to a number of physical systems where perturbation expansion of the equation of state is known .",
    "these include dilute bosonic gases ( in 3d , quasi 2d , and quasi 1d geometries ) , two - component fermi gases ( in 3d and in 1d ) , as well as a number of integrable one - dimensional models ( lieb - liniger , calogero - sutherland ) . in sec .",
    "[ secconclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider a gas of @xmath5 particles ( bosons or fermions ) at a density @xmath6 .",
    "we suppose that the density dependence of the chemical potential @xmath7 of the homogeneous system is known from either perturbation theory or from a fit to experimental data . within the _ local density approximation",
    "_ one assumes ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the chemical potential @xmath8 of a trapped system is given by the sum of the local chemical potential , which is taken to be equal to the chemical potential of the uniform system @xmath7 at the corresponding density , and the external field @xmath9 : @xmath10    in the following we will always consider a harmonic external confinement for two basic reasons . first , this is the most widely used trapping potential in cold gases .",
    "second , a quadratic potential can be used to describe the external potential close to its minimum . in order to consider the most general case we will assume that the trapping frequencies are different , so that the confinement is anisotropic @xmath11 .",
    "the value of the chemical potential @xmath8 of a trapped gas is fixed by the normalization condition @xmath12 dxdydz   \\label{ldan}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the density profile is obtained by inverting the density dependence of the local chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "the spatial extensions of the cloud , @xmath14 , depend on the value of the chemical potential and frequencies of the harmonic confinement : @xmath15    by expressing the distances in the trap in units of the size of the cloud : @xmath16 it follows immediately that the frequencies of the trap enter in eq .",
    "( [ ldan ] ) only through the combination @xmath17 and the normalization condition can be conveniently written in terms of the averaged oscillator length @xmath18 . now",
    "the integral is to be taken inside a sphere of radius @xmath19 and is symmetric with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "the normalization condition ( [ ldan ] ) can be conveniently rewritten in dimensionless units : @xmath21 \\mathbf{d\\tilde{r } } , \\qquad n(\\mathbf{\\tilde{r } } ) = 0 \\text{~for~ } |\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}|>1 \\label{ldandim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the chemical potential @xmath22 is expressed in units of @xmath23 , which is a natural unit of energy in the trap , the density in a homogeneous system @xmath24 is measured in units of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a length scale convenient for the homogeneous system ( for example , it can be equal to the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath2 ) , chemical potential ( _ i.e. _ the argument of the inverse function @xmath24 ) is measured in units of @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the dimensionality of the system , and the lda characteristic parameter @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30    from the eq .",
    "( [ ldandim ] ) it becomes clear that within the lda there is a scaling in terms of the characteristic parameter @xmath31 .",
    "in other words systems having a different number of particles and different frequencies of the harmonic confinement will have the _ same _ density profile and other lda properties ( once expressed in appropriate units as discussed above ) if they have equal values of the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we develop a general theory for a `` perturbative '' equation of state in a three- , two- , and one- dimensional systems .",
    "we start by writing down the equation of state @xmath32 . assuming that a perturbation approach can be applied to a homogeneous system",
    ", we suppose that @xmath32 is known as a series expansion , either at small or at high density , in terms of the expansion parameter ( it can be gas parameter @xmath33 in the weakly interacting regime and @xmath34 in the regime of strong interactions ) : @xmath35    in this formula the second term is considered to be small compared to the first term ( @xmath36 ) and will be treated perturbatively in the following .",
    "we will limit the series to the second term , as it is responsible for the main contribution to the dependence of the frequency of the breathing mode on the density , and we omit higher terms in the expansion  ( [ muhom ] ) .",
    "we obtain the value of the chemical potential of a trapped system by resolving the normalization condition  ( [ ldandim ] ) .",
    "the result can be conveniently expressed in terms of the characteristic parameter @xmath29 ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "@xmath37 where constants @xmath38 , @xmath39 are independent of the parameters of the trap and , instead , are directly related to the equation of state of a homogeneous system . in order to find them we evaluate the integral  ( [ ldandim ] ) in three- , two- , and one- dimensional geometries .",
    "the explicit expressions for the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given in table  [ tablecoef ] .",
    "the leading term in ( [ mu ] ) depends only on two parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , of the homogeneous equation of state , while in order to obtain the next term one has to know four parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "this type of behaviour is quite general and applies to majority of the quantities we estimate in a trapped gas , with the exception of the frequencies of collective oscillations , where the leading term depends only on @xmath41 ( see below ) .",
    ".coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the expansion of the chemical potential @xmath8 of a trapped system ( [ mu ] ) obtained from evaluation of the normalization integral ( [ ldandim ] ) . in a 3d system",
    "the integral is to be taken inside a sphere and can be evaluated explicitly if condition @xmath44 is satisfied ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in a two - dimensional system , @xmath45 ,",
    "the integral is to be calculated inside a circle of unit radius .",
    "there is a substitution @xmath46 @xmath47 which together with a particular form of the chemical potential ( [ muhom ] ) leads to an elementary integral . in a one - dimensional system , @xmath48 , the spatial integration over the coordinate @xmath49 goes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast to the two - dimensional case no simplification is found and the final expression for the chemical potential @xmath8 ( [ mu ] ) will contain the gamma functions as in fully three - dimensional case . the integration was carried out under conditions @xmath52 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     considering a system of one - dimensional fermions and limiting ourselves to the @xmath3-wave scattering we immediately find that atoms of the same spin do not interact due to the pauli exclusion principle . instead , fermions of different spin are allowed to interact and the interaction can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "the equation of state can be found by solving the integral bethe _ ansatz _",
    "equations as discussed for attractive @xcite and repulsive @xcite interactions .",
    "the numerical solution for the lda was carried out in @xcite and is compared here to the series expansions obtained from eq .",
    "( [ omega1d ] ) .",
    "again , there is interesting physics behind the expansion ( [ mu ] ) . in the weakly interacting limit ( both attraction and repulsion )",
    "the leading term equals the energy of an ideal two - component fermi gas .",
    "the next correction is linear in density and describe the mean - field interactions between particles of different spin . in the limit of strong repulsion",
    "the main contribution to @xmath8 coincides with the chemical potential of a _ one - component _ ideal 1d fermi gas with @xmath5 atoms , as the strong repulsion between atoms of different spin plays the role of an effective pauli principle @xcite .",
    "an attractive interaction in one - dimension immediately leads to the formation of a bound state ( molecule ) .",
    "as the binding energy is independent of the density and does not contribute to the collective oscillations , this term is omitted in table  [ tablefrequencies3d ] . in the low - density limit",
    "the internal structure of a molecule of two fermions can be neglected and be considered as a composite boson . since in this limit the interaction between such composite bosons is repulsive and strong ( tonks - girardeau limit of @xmath53 bosons of mass @xmath54 ) , the system can be mapped to @xmath53 spinless fermions .",
    "so the leading behavior is again of a fermionic nature .",
    "the next term was obtained correctly for the first time in @xcite and is reported in table  [ tablefrequencies1d ] .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1dbosons ] ,  [ fig1dfermions ] we visualize how the terms of the eos expansion show up in the frequencies of collective modes . the fig .  [ fig1dbosons ] shows the frequencies for bosonic systems , although the fig .",
    "[ fig1dfermions ] presents results for systems of two - component fermions .",
    "we compare the predictions of the expansion , eq .",
    "( [ omega1d ] ) , ( dashed lines ) with the numerical solution for the exact equation of state ( solid lines ) . as it can be seen from the figures ,",
    "the region where the perturbative results hold is quite large , making possible the extraction of the expansion terms of the equation of state from the frequencies of collective oscillations .",
    "the accuracy is better for the expansions at low density , since if the expansion holds for the center of the trap it will certainly be valid close to the borders of the trap where the density is smaller ( see , _ e.g. _ fig .  [ fig1dfermions ] ) .    ]    .",
    "the upper curve corresponds to attraction between atoms of opposite spin , while the lower curve corresponds to repulsion . ]",
    "it quite often happens that a perturbation theory for a homogeneous system can be developed analytically , although no solution for a system in an external confinement is known .",
    "if the number of particles in a trapped system is large enough ( and this requirement often can be easily fulfilled in experiments ) the local density approximation can be applied .",
    "we assume that the series expansion of the dependence of the chemical potential on density is known for a homogeneous system and we find the properties of a gas confined in an anisotropic trap .",
    "we consider three- , two- , and one- dimensional systems .",
    "we obtain the energetic properties such as the chemical potential , total energy of the gas , potential energy of the confinement .",
    "the calculated release energy can be accessed in expansion experiments .",
    "spatial properties such as the density profile and size of the cloud are predicted and can be measured by imaging techniques in current experiments .",
    "the frequencies of the collective oscillations in a harmonic trap are predicted from a hydrodynamic theory .",
    "we apply a scaling approach to obtain frequencies in three- , two- , and one- dimensional systems in traps with arbitrary aspect ratio @xmath55 . in spherical ,",
    "`` cigar''- and `` pancake''- shaped geometries the expressions are simplified . in a spherical trap an equivalent method , the sum - rule approach , can be conveniently applied and leads to analogous expressions . exploiting the obtained expressions and using our solution to the lda problem we relate the frequencies of the breathing modes to the expansion of the equation of state of a homogeneous systems in an explicit way .",
    "we argue that the obtained results are highly relevant for the experimental study of the equations of state of trapped gases .",
    "the expansion of the equation of state can be found by a best fit of our formulas to experimentally measured quantities ( for example , collective oscillation frequencies ) .",
    "this would provide an important insight into the physics of the systems under the study .",
    "as an example , there is an open and intriguing question of what will be the nature of the beyond - mean field term in the equation of state of the recently observed condensation of molecules .",
    "will it have a bosonic or fermionic nature ?",
    "both proposals can be found in the literature and only a high precision experiment can provide a definitive result .",
    "we apply the derived formalism to a number of three - dimensional systems ( two - component fermi gas in the bec - bcs crossover , dilute bose gas ) , quasi two - dimensional bose gas , quasi one - dimensional systems ( lieb - liniger gas , gas of hard - rods , two - component fermionic gas , calogero - sutherlanf gas ) . a comparison with numerical solutions",
    "is provided .",
    "finally we provide an physical interpretation of the expansion terms in a number of one - dimensional systems .",
