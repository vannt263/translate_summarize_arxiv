    "the theory of circle patterns is a rich fascinating area having its origin in classical theory of circle packings .",
    "its fast development in recent years is caused by mutual influence and interplay of ideas and concepts from discrete geometry , complex analysis and the theory of integrable systems .",
    "the progress in this area was initiated by thurston s idea @xcite,@xcite about approximating the riemann mapping by circle packings .",
    "classical circle packings comprised of disjoint open disks were later generalized to circle patterns where the disks may overlap ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "different underlying combinatorics were considered .",
    "schramm introduced a class of circle patterns with the combinatorics of the square grid @xcite ; hexagonal circle patterns were studied in @xcite and @xcite .    the striking analogy between circle patterns and the classical analytic function theory is underlined by such facts as the uniformization theorem concerning circle packing realizations of cell complexes of a prescribed combinatorics @xcite , discrete maximum principle , schwarz s lemma @xcite and rigidity properties @xcite,@xcite , discrete dirichlet principle @xcite .",
    "the convergence of discrete conformal maps represented by circle packings was proven by rodin and sullivan @xcite . for a prescribed regular combinatorics",
    "this result was refined .",
    "he and schramm @xcite showed that for hexagonal packings the convergence is @xmath2 the uniform convergence for circle patterns with the combinatorics of the square grid and orthogonal neighboring circles was established by schramm @xcite .",
    "approximation issue naturally leads to the question about analogs to standard holomorphic functions .",
    "computer experiments give evidence for their existence @xcite,@xcite however not very much is known . for circle packings with the hexagonal combinatorics the only",
    "explicitly described examples are doyle spirals @xcite,@xcite which are discrete analogs of exponential maps and conformally symmetric packings , which are analogs of a quotient of airy functions @xcite . for patterns with overlapping circles",
    "more explicit examples are known : discrete versions of @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xcite are constructed for patterns with underlying combinatorics of the square grid ; @xmath5 , @xmath1 are also described for hexagonal patterns @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turned out that an effective approach to the description of circle patterns with overlapping circles is given by the theory of integrable systems ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "for example , schramm s circle patterns are governed by a difference equation which is the stationary hirota equation @xcite ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "this approach proved to be especially useful for the construction of discrete @xmath5 and @xmath7 in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite with the aid of some isomonodromy problem .",
    "another connection with the theory of discrete integrable equations was revealed in @xcite,@xcite : embedded circle patterns are described by special solutions of discrete painlev ii equations , thus giving geometrical interpretation thereof .",
    "this research was motivated by the attempt to carry the results of @xcite,@xcite over square grid circle patterns with prescribed intersection angles giving schramm patterns as a special case .",
    "namely , we prove that such circle patterns mimicking @xmath5 and @xmath1 are embedded .",
    "this turned out to be not straightforward and lead to asymptotical analysis of solutions to _ discrete riccati equation_. as the riccati differential equation is known as the only equation of the first order possessing panlev property we are tempted to conclude that circle patterns are described by discrete equations with painlev property though there is no satisfactory generalization thereof on discrete equations .",

    "the intersection angle is the angle at the corner of disc intersection domain ( fig .",
    "[ angle ] ) .    to visualize the analogy between schramm s circle patterns and conformal maps , consider regular patterns composed of unit circles and suppose that the radii are being deformed to preserve the intersection angles of neighboring circles and the tangency of half - neighboring ones .",
