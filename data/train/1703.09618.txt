    "based on infinite product expansions and inequalities on series and the riemann s zeta function , daurizio ( @xcite ) proved the following inequality : @xmath0 where @xmath1 . using an elementary approach ,",
    "sndor ( @xcite ) offered an alternative proof of by employing trigonometric inequalities and an auxiliary function . in the same paper ,",
    "sndor also provided the converse to : @xmath2 where @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , sndor found the following analogous inequality holds true for the case of sine functions :    [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq original ] the two double inequalities @xmath3 and @xmath4 hold for any @xmath1 .    throughout this paper , we denote @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively : @xmath9    our aim is to generalize the daurizio - sndor inequalities for the case of @xmath10 and @xmath11 as follows :    [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] let @xmath12 .",
    "then the two double inequalities @xmath13 and @xmath14 hold for @xmath15 . in particular , the double inequality remains true when @xmath16 while the double inequality is reversed when @xmath16 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : proof of the main results ] is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] and an alternative proof of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq original ] . in section  [ sec : daurizio - sandor inequalities for hyperbolic functions ] , we establish analogue of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] for hyperbolic functions . as an application of theorem  [ thm :",
    "daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] , we apply in section  [ sec : application ] inequality to the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and establish a trigonometric inequality .",
    "at first we will prove the following lemma .",
    "the lemma provides expressions of the higher - order derivative @xmath17 involving @xmath18 @xmath19 , which are helpful in proving theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] .",
    "we note that the sign of @xmath17 plays a crucial role in proving theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] .",
    "[ lem : lots of f ] let @xmath12 and @xmath20 .",
    "then when @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we have    @xmath23 : :    @xmath24 @xmath25 : :    @xmath26    +    in particular , @xmath27 : :    when @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xmath30 : :    when @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 : :    for @xmath34 and    @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    @xmath23 , @xmath25 and @xmath33 follows directly from calculations using elementary calculus .",
    "in particular , trigonometric addition formulas are used in proving @xmath23 and @xmath25 . to prove ,",
    "we claim @xmath37 indeed , we rewrite @xmath38 on the other hand , making use of euler s formula @xmath39 leads to an alternative expression of the left - hand side of : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the real part of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "now it suffices to show @xmath44 using in @xmath25 , this can be achieved by straightforward calculations .",
    "thus @xmath27 is true .",
    "the proof of @xmath30 is similar , and we omit the details .",
    "we complete the proof of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] .",
    "we provide here an alternative proof of the two double inequalities in theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq original ] .    to this end , we show that for @xmath1 , @xmath45 is strictly increasing while @xmath46 is strictly decreasing . these lead to the desired inequalities since it is easy to see that @xmath47 to see @xmath48 is strictly increasing , we employ in lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] to obtain @xmath49 as @xmath50 , it follows that @xmath51 .",
    "we are led to @xmath52 or @xmath53 since @xmath54 .",
    "this that shows @xmath48 is strictly increasing .    by using in lemma  [ lem : lots of f ]",
    ", we have @xmath55 from which we infer that @xmath56 since @xmath57 by @xmath33 of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] . then @xmath58 together with the fact @xmath59 from @xmath33 of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] yields @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath62 is strictly decreasing .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "we are now in the position to give the proof of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] .",
    "the proof of the case when @xmath16 has been given in theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] . for @xmath63 , we prove the desired inequalities by showing that @xmath64 for @xmath34 .",
    "due to @xmath23 of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] , we see that @xmath65 for @xmath63 . instead of employing @xmath25 of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] , we use and in lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] to conclude that @xmath66 .",
    "thus we have for @xmath34 , @xmath67 because of the first vanishing limit in @xmath33 of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] , it follows that @xmath68 which , together with the fact that the second limit in @xmath33 of lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] vanishes , implies that @xmath69 or @xmath64 for @xmath34 .",
    "it remains to find the following limits : @xmath70 we immediately have @xmath71 and @xmath72 the proof is completed .",
    "in this section , we show an analogue of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] for the case of hyperbolic functions holds true .",
    "let @xmath73 following the same arguments for proving lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] , it can be shown that lemma  [ lem : lots of f ] with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath18 @xmath19 replaced by @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath19 respectively , remains true .",
    "it follows that we can prove @xmath79 for @xmath34 as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] .",
    "it remains to calculate the following limits : @xmath80 thus , we have the following analogue of theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "[ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized hyperbolic fcn ] let @xmath12 .",
    "then the two double inequalities @xmath81 and @xmath82 hold for @xmath15 . in particular , the double inequality is reversed when @xmath16 while the double inequality remains true when @xmath16 .",
    "the first few chebyshev polynomials of the second kind @xmath83 @xmath84 are ( @xcite ) @xmath85 in this section , we apply theorem  [ thm : daurizio - sandor ineq generalized ] to @xmath83 with @xmath86 . by means of the formula @xmath87 , we obtain the following corollary .",
