    "we briefly review the requirements for candidate uhecr sources ( energetics , luminosity , and confinement ) and check that agns satisfy all of them , if the highest - energy crs are heavy nuclei .    the energy generation rate necessary to sustain the uhecr flux above @xmath9 is @xmath10@xmath11ergmpc@xmath12yr@xmath13(e.g .",

    "agns would meet the energy requirement if they emitted a fraction @xmath19 of their bolometric luminosity in uhecrs .",

    "these considerations support the hypothesis that agns can accelerate eev protons and iron nuclei up to the highest observed energies even for rather small acceleration efficiencies ( @xmath35 of the jet power ) .",
    "non - relativistic supersonic flows that dissipate their energy into shocks can efficiently energize crs via diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in relativistic flows , instead , diffusive acceleration may be quite suppressed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a boost of @xmath61 in the laboratory requires the particle to stay in the flow for @xmath63 , during which it travels a distance @xmath64 with @xmath65 the maximum uhecr lorentz factor . in reality , since relativistic flows diverge and the magnetic field drops ( @xmath66 few g @xmath67 in blazar jets , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "uhecr acceleration via such a one - shot ( _ espresso _ ) mechanism thus requires either ultra - relativistic flows with @xmath71 , or moderate lorentz factors and pre - accelerated particles .",

    "since the dependence on @xmath81 is very weak , and since @xmath85 is proportional to the total galactic mass , which does not differ greatly from galaxy to galaxy , @xmath20 is expected to be roughly the same for any snrs expanding in the interstellar medium . for core - collapse sne , instead , @xmath20 is achieved while the shock is still propagating in the wind launched in the pre - sn stages @xcite , which should be independent of the properties of the galaxy .",
    "we conclude that the maximum energy of crs accelerated in snrs should be rather universal and correspond to the cr knee in the milky way .",

    "also cr electrons , whose galactic spectrum is cut off around 1 tev , may be reprocessed via the same mechanism ; however , it is not obvious that even tev electrons have gyroradii large enough to penetrate into the jet and , in general , radiative losses should prevent them from being accelerated to very high energies .      ev , for different species as in the legend .",

    "]    a natural prediction of the proposed mechanism is that the chemical composition of galactic - like crs , which is increasingly heavy above @xmath101ev and dominated by iron nuclei around @xmath102ev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this scenario is supported by recent auger observations , which suggest a proton - dominated flux at @xmath0ev and a heavier composition at higher energies @xcite . in particular",
    ", the composition is nitrogen - like at @xmath103ev , whereas the limited statistics do not yet allow conclusive measurements at higher energies ; the inferred trend does not exclude an iron contribution above @xmath5ev .",
    "these results are not inconsistent with the telescope array s report of a pure proton composition if the different apertures , event selection cuts , and monte carlo models are taken into account @xcite . with adequate statistics ,",
    "the telescope array should be able to distinguish between a proton - only and the auger mixed composition ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "energy fluxes of galactic crs can be parameterized as @xmath104 where cr species ( @xmath105=h , he , c / n / o , mg / al / si , fe ) are grouped according to their ( effective ) charge @xmath106=1 , 2 , 7 , 13 , 26 and atomic mass @xmath107=1 , 4 , 13 , 27 , 56 ; their abundances are tuned to the ones measured at @xmath108ev , namely @xmath109@xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use these simplified scalings , which capture the essential features of the most abundant species in galactic crs , as proxies for cr seeds in other galaxies as well .",
    "interestingly , the cr spectrum reprocessed by agn jets may be _ flatter _ than the one inside the galaxy .",
    "snrs inject crs in the disk ( @xmath114 ) with a spectrum @xmath115 , propagate in the halo ( of thickness @xmath116kpc ) with a diffusion coefficient @xmath117 , where @xmath118 , and escape after a time @xmath119 .",
    "the solution of the diffusion equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) returns an equilibrium spectrum of @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , if the host galaxy is very dense ( such that spallation losses dominate over diffusive escape ) , one finds equilibrium spectra of @xmath124 , and high - galactic - altitude spectra as flat as @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "it is hence possible for extended jets to sweep up cr seeds with relatively flat spectra .",
    "finally , energy - dependent percolation into the jet ( and possibly seed acceleration at the boundary layer : see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may lead to flatter injection spectra with a low - energy cut - off determined by the minimum energy for which crs can enter the jet .    to calculate the spectra produced via espresso acceleration",
    ", we take galactic - like crs with the composition in equation [ eq : fluxes ] and with fiducial injection spectra @xmath126 , and boost them in energy by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "note that reproducing uhecr spectra and composition only requires the reacceleration of crs with rigidities about one decade below the knee .",
    "the overall uhecr normalization is chosen in order to reproduce the observed fluxes , and is consistent with the efficiency outlined above .",
    "there is a rising consensus @xcite that an additional light component must be relevant at @xmath127ev in order to explain uhecr spectra and composition ; we consider this extra `` eev component '' as well , modeled as in the paper by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows the obtained fluxes and chemical composition above @xmath128ev ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) , compared with uhecr data .",
    "the model qualitatively reproduces the observed spectral features and the characteristic light  heavy  light",
    " heavy modulation .",
    "the agreement with observations is rather good , even if not remarkable above @xmath129ev .",
    "a proper description of source distribution , injection spectra , nuclei photo - disintegration , and proton photo - pion production would be needed to explain the fine structure of uhecr spectra and composition @xcite , but is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that inelastic losses should make the composition lighter at the highest energies , in better agreement with observations .",
    "most of the ingredients of the presented model are not completely new , but we believe the proposed model to be quite original in its entirety . for instance , ostrowski pointed out the possibility of generating uhecrs in fast blazer jets via _ diffusive _ acceleration of thermal particles at the jet boundary @xcite .",
    "instead , the espresso mechanism relies on energetic cr seeds and on a more general one - shot acceleration , which in addition returns the uhecr composition consistent with observations .",
    "also the idea of producing uhecrs via cr reacceleration has already been suggested , either via relativistic matter plasmoids ejected by accreting black holes and neutron star , (  cannonballs ,  see * ? ? ? * ) , or via the interaction of agn jets with large star - forming gaseous shells ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , such models need quite peculiar environmental structures whose cross - section is much smaller than the jet lateral surface that matters for espresso acceleration",
    ".    the lorentz factors inferred from multi - wavelength studies of blazars can be as high as 3040 @xcite .",
    "some powerful sources ( e.g. , mrk 421 and mrk 501 , for which @xmath130 and redshift @xmath131 ) are found within the uhecr `` horizon , '' i.e. , their distance is less than or comparable to the mean free path for inelastic processes , such as photo - pion production for uhe protons and photo - disintegration for heavier nuclei ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "photo - disintegration around sources can in principle alter the uhecr chemical composition significantly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is not expected to be important for the espresso mechanism , if most of the reacceleration occurs well beyond the agn broad line region ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the low level of anisotropy measured in the uhecr arrival directions @xcite suggests that the horizon encompasses several sources , not necessarily associated with copious emission in other bands , such as @xmath132rays .",
    "the census of potentially - relevant active galaxies may not be limited to the few powerful _ known _ blazars inside the horizon : since some espresso - accelerated uhecrs may escape the jet sideways , also radio galaxies whose @xmath133-ray emission is not beamed in our direction may partially contribute to the measured uhecr flux .",
    "in general , different types of agns ( not just powerful bl lac objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ) may be responsible for the global shape of the galactic to extragalactic transition .",
    "the eev component , for instance , may be produced via espresso acceleration in galaxies hosting jets with moderate luminosities and @xmath134 ( see equation [ eq : lcr ] ) , which are numerous inside the horizon .",
    "such agns could be responsible for the production of the multi - pev neutrinos detected by icecube @xcite .",
    "a more detailed account for agn zoology ( distribution in luminosity , lorentz factors , and redshift ) is needed to further probe this scenario .",
    "finally , we check whether espresso acceleration may work also in the ultra - relativistic flows of other candidate sources of uhecrs .",
    "pulsar winds have very large @xmath71 , and live in environments rich in cr seeds accelerated at the surrounding snr shocks .",
    "however , for the crab parameters ( @xmath135 , @xmath136pc , and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 g is the nebular field ) , crs can not achieve isotropization within the wind ( see equation [ eq : crit ] ) ; such a requirement is unlikely to be fulfilled also in newly born millisecond pulsars . for grbs , instead , the limited extent of their jets makes it impossible to reaccelerate a sizable fraction of galactic cr seeds .    in summary",
    ", we presented a general mechanism for the acceleration of uhecrs in energetic agn jets .",
    "if the relativistic flow is sufficiently extended ( equations [ eq : hillas ] and [ eq : crit ] ) , seed crs with gyroradii large enough to cross the jet boundary can be boosted by a factor of @xmath2 in energy and be accelerated up to @xmath139ev . under reasonable assumptions ,",
    "such a one - shot _ espresso _ acceleration can account for both the spectrum and chemical composition of uhecrs ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "in forthcoming works we will probe this scenario by : testing cr injection and energy gain in realistic jet structures ; accounting for agn phenomenology ; and including uhecr propagation and losses .",
