    "a search for new thermoelectric ( te ) materials is an old problem that has been reexamined to date @xcite .",
    "even though binary compounds might have been thoroughly studied , a thermoelectric material of higher performance might sleep in ternary , quaternary or more complicated compounds .",
    "a filled skutterudite is an example for newly discovered te materials @xcite .",
    "very recently terasaki , sasago and uchinokura have found that a layered co oxide naco@xmath2o@xmath3 , whose crystal structure is schematically drawn in fig .",
    "1 , shows large thermopower ( 100 @xmath11v / k at 300 k ) and low resistivity ( 200 @xmath12 cm at 300 k ) along the @xmath13 axis @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of this compound is that the thermopower of 100 @xmath11v / k is realized in the carrier density of 10@xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "this is difficult to explain in the framework of the conventional band picture , and there should exist a mechanism to enhance the thermopower .    in conventional te materials , the te performance is optimized near a carrier density of @xmath16 @xmath15 .",
    "thus we expect that the te performance of naco@xmath2o@xmath3 may be improved by the reduction of the carrier density . the easiest way to change the carrier density is to substitute a divalent cation such as ca@xmath5 for a monovalent na@xmath17 .",
    "motivated by this , we measured and analyzed the resistivity and thermopower of polycrystalline ( na , ca)co@xmath2o@xmath3 . another way is to study a two - dimensional co oxide with low carrier density . for this purpose",
    "bi@xmath2sr@xmath18co@xmath2o@xmath9 ( the crystal structure is shown in fig .",
    "2 ) is most suitable , because the resistivity is lowered by the ba - substitution for sr @xcite and the pb substitution for bi @xcite .",
    "in addition , the optical reflectivity shows a small drude weight @xcite .",
    "we report on its transport properties in the latter part of the proceedings .",
    "polycrystalline samples of na@xmath0ca@xmath1co@xmath2o@xmath3 were prepared in a conventional solid - state reaction @xcite .",
    "an appropriate mixture of powdered naco@xmath18 , caco@xmath18 and co@xmath18o@xmath3 was calcined at 860@xmath19c for 12 h. the product was finely ground , pressed into a pellet , and sintered at 800@xmath19c for 6 h. the x - ray diffraction pattern showed no trace of impurities .",
    "note that the a tiny trace of impurity phases was detected in the product from stoichiometric mixture ( na : co=1:2 ) , which indicates the evaporation of a small amount of na .",
    "thus we added excess na of 10 at.% to prepare naco@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath20co@xmath2o@xmath9 ( @xmath21=sr and ba ) @xcite and bi@xmath7pb@xmath1sr@xmath18co@xmath2o@xmath9 @xcite were prepared by a self - flux technique .",
    "crystals were platelike with typical dimensions of 1@xmath221@xmath220.01 mm@xmath23 .",
    "as for the pb substitution , we prepared two different crystals with nominal compositions of @xmath4=0.2 and 0.4 .",
    "resistivity ( @xmath24 ) was measured through a four - probe method .",
    "thermopower ( @xmath25 ) was measured with a nano - voltmeter ( hp 34420a ) , where a typical resolution was 510 nv .",
    "two edges of a sample was pasted on cu sheets working as a heat bath , and the temperature gradient of 0.51 k was measured through a differential thermocouple made of copper - constantan .",
    "the contributions from copper leads were carefully subtracted .",
    "let us begin with the effect of excess na on the resistivity of na@xmath26co@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "na is an element difficult to control .",
    "first , it is quite volatile above 800@xmath19c .",
    "secondly , residual na is rarely observed in x - ray diffraction patterns , because it often exists as deliquesced naoh in the grain boundary .",
    "moreover the na site in naco@xmath2o@xmath3 is 50% vacant , that is , the na content @xmath4 can change from 0 to 1 .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath24 of polycrystalline na@xmath26co@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we attributed the increase of @xmath24 with @xmath4 to the excess na in the grain boundaries , and regarded the sample for @xmath27 as the parent material for ca substitution .",
    "figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show @xmath24 and @xmath25 of polycrystalline samples of na@xmath0ca@xmath1co@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 increase with @xmath4 , suggesting that the carrier density is reduced by the ca substitution .",
    "this is naturally understood from a viewpoint of co valence . in naco@xmath2o@xmath3",
    "the formal valence ( @xmath28 ) of co is @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ , co@xmath30:co@xmath31=1:1 .",
    "the ca substitution decreases @xmath28 down to @xmath32 , which corresponds to the configuration of @xmath33 .",
    "since the six electrons fully occupied the three @xmath34 bands in the low spin state , oxides with co@xmath30 are often insulating .",
    "as expected , the power factor @xmath35 is improved in @xmath360.15 by 20% .",
    "it should be emphasized that the ca substitution changes the temperature dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "for example , while @xmath24 for @xmath4=0 shows a positive curvature below 100 k , @xmath24 for @xmath4=0.35 shows a negative curvature .",
    "this indicates that the scattering rate depends strongly on the carrier density , which is unlikely to arise from the electron - phonon scattering .",
    "next we discuss the thermoeletric properties of ( bi , pb)@xmath20co@xmath2o@xmath9 . in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 of bi@xmath20co@xmath2o@xmath9 single crystals along the in - plane direction are plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "@xmath24 of the present samples reproduces the data in the literature , where the electric conduction for @xmath21=ba is more metallic than that for @xmath21=ba @xcite .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath25 is above 100 @xmath11v / k for both samples , owing to the small carrier density .",
    "in contrast to the ba substitution for sr , pb not only works as an acceptor , but also modifies the electronic states of bi@xmath2sr@xmath18co@xmath2o@xmath9 .",
    "figures 6(a ) and 6(b ) show @xmath24 and @xmath25 of bi@xmath7pb@xmath1sr@xmath18co@xmath2o@xmath9 single crystals along the in - plane direction .",
    "@xmath24 is decreased drastically by the pb substitution , which looks similar to fig .",
    "however , @xmath25 remains nearly unchanged upon the pb substitution , which clearly indicates that the ba and pb substitutions affect the electronic states differently .",
    "the anomalous electronic states of bi@xmath7pb@xmath1sr@xmath18co@xmath2o@xmath9 are also suggested by the large negative magnetoresistance at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "in summary , we prepared polycrystalline samples of na@xmath0ca@xmath1co@xmath2o@xmath3 and single - crystal samples of bi@xmath7pb@xmath8co@xmath2o@xmath9 ( @xmath21= sr and ba ; @xmath4=0 , 0.2 and 0.4 ) . in na@xmath0ca@xmath1co@xmath2o@xmath3 , both the resistivity and the thermopower increase with @xmath4 , which suggests that the carrier density is decreased by the ca substitution . in bi@xmath7pb@xmath8co@xmath2o@xmath9 ,",
    "the resistivity is decreased by the ba and pb substitutions , but the doping effects on the thermopower are different . while the ba substitution decreases the thermopower , the pb substitution hardly changes the thermopower .",
    "this is a direct example that the resistivity can be lowered while the thermopower is kept large .",
