    "the feynman - alpha theory for neutrons has a long history in a field of reactor applications .",
    "it was traditionally used for evaluation of subcritical reactivity in reactors during startup with a neutron source , and later in accelerator - driven systems @xcite . relatively recently",
    "this method received attention in the area of nuclear safeguards for purposes of detection of special nuclear materials and spent fuel assay @xcite .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the traditional approach in safeguards applications was related to the use of thermal neutron detectors , which limited the performance in terms of time , type and activity of the radioactive or nuclear material and data completeness ( information about the energy of particles is lost during slowing down process ) .",
    "therefore , attempts were made in order to use fast neutron detection for the evaluation of the feynman - y function of the variance to mean ratio @xcite .",
    "a comparision between the performance of thermal and fast detection systems @xcite showed that it took 8.5 hours for a thermal detection system ( @xmath3he counters ) in contrast to 100 seconds for a fast detection system ( liquid scintillation detectors with pulse shape discrimination ) to assay a weak @xmath0cf - source by using feynman - alpha approach .",
    "however , when using fast scintillation detectors for this purpose , which are also sensitive to gamma photons , the need arose to discriminate between neutrons and gamma particles , whereby the lack of a robust discrimination method represented a complication in the application of the method .    to address this problem and to extend the capacities of the feynman - alpha approach , we suggest here an alternative path , by deriving feynman - alpha formulas by taking into account the generation and detection of gamma photons .",
    "this way , two new versions of the feynman - alpha theory can be elaborated : one based only on the detection of gamma particles , and another in which both neutrons and gamma photons are detected without identifying which is which , i.e. not performing pulse shape discrimination and only considering the total ( neutron and gamma ) counts .    in this work",
    "we do not include delayed neutrons treatment .",
    "the reason for this is that the delayed neutrons are emitted long after the fission event , e.g. mean delay times are varying between 0.1 and 10 s , and therefore , their contribution is expected to be negligible while working with fast detection systems ( time scale from 1 ns to 10000 ns ) .",
    "the capture gammas , photofission and photonuclear neutrons are not included in the present theory either .",
    "their effect to the neutron - gamma feynman variance - to - mean ratios for neutron , gamma and total detection is investigated by us separately @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons why the new versions of the feynman - alpha formulas are considered in a one - group approximation .",
    "one is to enable them for a relatively easy practical use and another is related to the fact that according to the results of recent theoretical investigation @xcite , the one - point one - group version and the two - point two - group version of feynman - alpha formulas used for fast neutron detections lead to the same results .    having derived the corresponding formulas , they are investigated both numerically and experimentally .",
    "the derivation given below will use the same assumptions as the traditional feynman - alpha theory for neutrons @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes a homogeneous infinite medium in which the detector is also distrubuted homogeneously .",
    "in such a setting the temporal evolution of the neutron chains is determined by the properties of the multiplying medium , which are only very slightly influenced by the presence of the detector , which is a weak absorber compared to the medium .",
    "the exponent alpha , extracted from the measurement , is characteristic to the speed of the dying out of the subcritical chains and hence is a characteristics of the material . due to this reason",
    ", the primary use of the theory as developed in this paper is envisaged for enhancing the performance of the feynman - alpha method for measurements of the subcritical reactivity and it will be tested in measurements at a research reactor .",
    "however , our main purpose is to extend the capabilities of the feynman - alpha method in safeguards applications in order to characterise an unknown sample .",
    "as is also discussed in the literature @xcite , the application of the feynman - alpha method in safeguards measurements , and in particular for measurements on orphan sources , is not straightforward .",
    "the detector is outside of the ( usually small ) sample , and only detects the neutrons which leaked out from the sample .",
    "in contrast to the large , close to critical reactor cores with a detector embedded into the core or the reflector , the statistics of the leaked out neutrons here is determined largely ( and for small samples , solely ) by the multiplicity of the neutron source ( which is spontaneous fission ) and to a lesser extent from the multiplication in the medium , whereas the parameter alpha ( inverse of the die - away time ) is determined by the properties of the detector .",
    "the properties of the material ( the unknown sample ) are extracted mostly from its properties as a spontaneous neutron source with a multiplicity , rather than from the properties of the internal multiplication in the system .    for these reasons , application of the feynman - alpha method in safeguards measurements",
    "is based on the asymptotic value of the variance to mean , rather than on its temporal evolution , characterised by the parameter alpha .",
    "the combination of the asymptotic value of the variance to mean in neutron measurements and the average count rate , was already used for determinining the strength of an@xmath4 source .",
    "one application of the present theory is to attempt the same by using gamma photons or both neutrons and gamma photons .",
    "however , we shall have in mind the difference between the assumptions of the model and the application .      the neutron - gamma variance to mean",
    "( feynman - alpha ) formulas for separate gamma detection and total neutron - gamma detection will be derived by using the kolmogorov forward approach the same way as described in @xcite . in the model that will be used for the derivations",
    "we assume that there are neutron and gamma populations : neutrons ( denoted as particles of type 1 ) and gammas ( denoted as type 2 ) .",
    "neutrons can undergo the reactions ( i ) listed below :    * absorption ( @xmath5 ) with no gammas emitted , * fission ( @xmath6 ) with corresponding gamma emission , * detection ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "gamma particles can undergo the same reactions ( i ) as neutrons except fission , i.e. photofission or photonuclear reactions are not considered in the present model .",
    "as mentioned , the assumption behind the model is the same as with the traditional feynman - alpha theory , i.e. that the medium is infinite and homogeneous with space - independent reaction intensities for absorption of neutrons ( @xmath8 ) and gammas ( @xmath9 ) , fission induced by neutrons ( @xmath10 ) and detection of neutrons ( @xmath11 ) and gammas ( @xmath12 ) , as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "thus , the total transition intensities for neutrons and gammas are denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15    in the model we include a compound poisson source of neutrons and gammas with emission intensity @xmath16 .",
    "the source is assumed to release @xmath17 neutrons and @xmath18 gammas in one emission event with the probability distribution @xmath19 .",
    "for the induced fission reaction , we consider that @xmath20 neutrons and @xmath21 gammas are emitted with the probability distribution @xmath22 .",
    "all fission neutrons are assumed to be prompt , i.e. delayed neutrons as not considered in this work .",
    "no delayed generation processes for gamma photons are assumed either .      in order to derive the one - group one - point feynman - alpha theory for separate detection of neutrons and gammas ,",
    "let us assume that the source @xmath23 is switched on at the time @xmath24 , whereas the separate detection processes for neutrons and gammas both are started at the same fixed time instant @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "let the random processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the number of neutrons and gammas at the time @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 - the number of neutron and gamma detections in the time interval [ @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "thus , the joint probability of having @xmath33 neutrons and @xmath34 gammas at time @xmath35 in the system , and having detected @xmath36 neutrons and @xmath37 gammas during the period of time @xmath38 can be defined as @xmath39 . by summing up the probabilities of all mutually exclusive events of the particle not having or having a specific reaction within the infinitesimally small time interval d@xmath35 , one obtains the forward kolmogorov or forward master equation @xmath40 where , as mentioned earlier , @xmath41 is the number distribution of neutrons and gammas in an induced fission event .",
    "the initial condition reads as @xmath42 the various moments of the particle numbers and detection numbers can be obtained from this equation by using the generating function technique in a way similar to as described in @xcite . by defining the following generating function for the probability distribution @xmath43 : @xmath44 with the initial condition for @xmath45 @xmath46 the following partial differential equation is obtained : @xmath47\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x } + [ \\lambda_{2a } + \\lambda_{2d}w - \\lambda_{2}y]\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y } + s [ r(x , y ) - 1 ] g. \\end{split}\\ ] ] here the generating functions of the number distributions of neutrons and gamma photons in a source event ( spontaneous fission ) and an induced fission event were introduced as @xmath48 in the above , as mentioned before , @xmath49__(m , n ) _ _ is the probability of having _",
    "neutrons and _ n _ gammas produced in a source event . for the sake of simplicity , some notations are introduced as follows :",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 in a steady subcritical medium with a steady source , a stationary state of the system exists when @xmath52 . for that case",
    "the following solutions are obtained for the constant neutron and gamma populations @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the time - varying detection counts @xmath55 , @xmath56 : @xmath57 as a sideline , it can be mentioned that in reactor physics terminology , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "accounting also for the definition of the reactivity @xmath60 as @xmath61 the first equation in ( [ eq:10 ] ) can be written as @xmath62 where the notation @xmath63 was introduced for the average number neutrons emitted in a source event .",
    "( [ eq : classic ] ) is the known classical result for a stationary subcritical system with a source having multiplicity @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this is expected since the coupling between the neutrons and the gamma photons is only one way , i.e. the evolution of the number of gamma photons has no influence on the neutrons , hence all results that refer only to the neutrons are the same as in the classical theory including only neutrons .    by introducing the modified second factorial moment of the random variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 as follows @xmath66 and then taking cross- and auto - derivatives , the following system of differential equations is obtained for the modified second factorial moments @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 of the neutron and gamma populations : @xmath70 in a stationary system , these modified moments are constant , and can be easily obtained by solving the algebraic equation resulting from setting the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : stac ] ) equal to zero .",
    "the time dependent modified second moments , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 can be found by solving the system of equations : @xmath77 again , as could be expected , the first two equations , referring to neutron numbers and detections only , decouple from the rest , and even from each other such that the first one can be solved alone and the result can be used to solve the second equation .",
    "this will lead to the well - known feynman - alpha expression for neutrons with one exponent only , being equal to @xmath78 @xcite : @xmath79    for the gammas , the rest of the coupled equations have to be solved with a second order characteristic equation . the final expression for the feynman - alpha formulas for gammas",
    "is given as below : @xmath80 the two roots @xmath81 and @xmath82 are obtained as @xmath83 it is interesting to notice that @xmath81 is the same for neutrons and gammas , i.e. @xmath84 .    the functions @xmath85 , @xmath86 in the gamma feynman - alpha formula ( [ gammay ] ) are given in the form : @xmath87 it can be shown that : @xmath88      the motivation behind a separate derivation of the feynman - alpha formula for the total detection of neutrons and gammas is related to the fact that variance of the total detection of neutrons and gammas can not be represented as a linear combination of variances of the separate detection of neutrons and gammas because number of detections for neutrons and gamma are not independent variables .",
    "the assumptions below for the one - group one - point feynman - alpha theory for the total detection of neutrons and gammas are similar to the ones used above for the separate detection of neutrons and gammas with the only difference that now @xmath89 represents the number of total neutron and gamma detections in the time interval [ @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the joint probability of having @xmath33 neutrons and @xmath34 gammas at time @xmath35 , and @xmath90 neutrons and gammas together having been detected during the period of time @xmath38 can be defined as @xmath91 . repeating the same procedure as before ,",
    "one obtains the following forward - type equation : @xmath92 with the initial condition @xmath93 a generating function with the initial condition for @xmath45 , @xmath94 , in this case will be introduced as below : @xmath95 after some simple manipulations , a partial differential equation is obtained : @xmath96\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x } + [ \\lambda_{2a } + \\lambda_{2d}w - \\lambda_{2}y]\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y } + s [ r(x , y ) - 1 ] g \\end{split}\\ ] ] for the stationary case , the quantities @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath97 are given as follows : @xmath98 where , for obvious reasons , the first two expressions are identical with those of the previous case , eqs ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "the modified second moments , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 can be found by solving the system of equations in the stationary state with zero left hand sides : @xmath99 the modified second moments , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 can be found by solving the system of equations : @xmath103 thus , the final expression of the feynman - alpha formula for the total joint detection of neutrons and gammas is given as below : @xmath104 where the functions @xmath105 , @xmath106 are given in the form : @xmath107 @xmath108 it can be shown that @xmath109 it is interesting to notice that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the same as in the case of variance to mean formula for gamma detections only : @xmath112",
    "because of their use in safeguards applications , in order to see the tendency in the behavior of asymptotic values of the feynman - y function for the gamma , neutron and total detections , in this section we analyze the theoretical expressions for thee asymptotic values of the feynman - y functions for the specific case when only a compound source is present in a system , but no internal multiplication takes place .",
    "this means that one sets @xmath113 , which leads to a significant simplification of the formulas .",
    "all terms related to the first and second moments of the number of neutrons in induced fission will disappear .",
    "it is clear that these formulas could have been obtained in a simpler way , too .    after a number of algebraic operations ,",
    "the asymptotic values of the feynman - y function for the neutron , gamma and total detections can be expressed in a form as below :    @xmath114    thus , as it could be easily obtained from the expressions above , the asymptotic value of the feynman - y function for the total detections will be higher , lower or equal to that for gamma detections when following inequalities are valid : @xmath115 in the case of a @xmath0cf - source the value of the expression @xmath116 is equal to 0.924959 .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the tendency in the behavior of the asymptotic values of the feynman - y function for the gamma , neutron and total detections will be different , depending on the properties of the system .",
    "it should be also mentioned that if we consider a two - group theory for neutrons @xcite for this specific case , the final expressions for an asymptotic value of the feynman - y function for neutron detection in non - multiplying media will be the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq:33 ] ) with the only difference that : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a removal of neutrons from a fast group ( highly energetic neutrons ) to a thermal group ( low energetic neutrons ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in a non - multiplying medium with a multiple ( compound ) source , or , better to say in the case of a small sample with negligible internal multiplication , one can estimate the source intensity ( hence the sample mass ) by using the asymptotic value of the feynman - y function and the average count rate ( counts per second , cps ) in the long gate ( when an asymptotic value is achieved ) for neutron and gamma detections as below : @xmath119    however , as could be seen from the expression below , it is not easy to estimate it by using an asymptotic value of the feynman - y function for total detections : @xmath120 where as follows from @xmath121 : @xmath122 nevertheless , inclusion of the information from the asymptotic value of the feynman - y function for the total detection of neutrons and photons might improve the accuracy of the evaluation of the source intensity .",
    "in order to compare quantitatively the three different alternatives of the feynman - alpha theory , namely the traditional one and the two new ones introduced in this paper , mcnpx @xcite simulations were performed in a simplified setup .",
    "the setup consists of two ej-309 liquid scintillation detectors ( d76 x 76 mm ) and a @xmath0cf - source in a form of a disk with a radius of 0.45 cm , as shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "each detector is located 10 cm from the source .",
    "this setup was chosen because of its similarity to a potential measurement situation with an orphan source . as mentioned before ,",
    "the conditions needed for the validity of the formulas derived in the foregoing are not fulfilled . however , as was also mentioned , only the asymmpotic values of the variance to mean will be used , which are supposed to be less affected by the deviations between the measurement conditions and the assumptions of the theory .",
    "the comparison of the neutron , gamma and total ( neutron and gamma ) variance to mean ratios is made by using quantitative values of the transition probabilities and reaction intensities obtained in a way similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , some quantities were obtained via processing a ptrac file .",
    "gammas from neutron capture are not included either in the simulations or in the theory ; they will be considered in further work .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig:4 ] , the behaviour of the dependence of the variance to mean for the number of gamma , neutron and total ( neutron and gamma ) detector counts on the detection time agrees with the theory predictions . the asymptotic value of the feynman - y function is higher for gamma detections in comparison with the total and neutron detections .        the variance to mean ratio for neutrons reaches its asymptotic value in a time range between 500 - 1000 ns , whereas the variance to mean ratio for gamma detections and total detections result in a plateau starting in the time interval of 1 - 500 ns . formally , this is due to the fact that in addition to the single exponent of the neutron variance to mean formula , the gamma and neutron - gamma variance to mean contains one more exponent , which is larger , due to the shorter lifetime of the gamma photons .",
    "in addition to the numerical evaluation of the newly derived variance to mean formulas for gamma and total ( neutron and gamma ) detections , these ratios were evaluated experimentally . because of the earlier mentioned deviations between the assumptions of the theory and the experimental setup , these should be considered more like an attempt to get hands - on experience with the data collection and and evaluation procedure , as well as a preliminary study of the effect of the approximations of the theory .",

    "the most likely reason is the deviation between the model assumptions and experimental setup , including the detection process , just as with the @xmath2na sources .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that , as also mentioned earlier , the activity of @xmath0cf calculated via using asymptotic values of the feynman - y function and count rate for the neutron detections is in agreement with the declared value .",

    "derivation and evaluation of analytical expressions for the new neutron - gamma variance to mean ( feynman - alpha ) formulas for separate gamma and total detections for both reactor and safeguards applications were presented in this paper .",

    "one of the exponents ( @xmath148 ) is the same for total and gamma detections as for neutron detections .",

    "this is not valid in reverse , i.e. the variance to mean ( feynman - y ) formula for neutron detections does not contain any information on gamma population or detection characteristics .",
    "the results of the analysis of the theoretical expressions for a case of non - multiplying media ( source without internal multiplication ) showed that the order of magnitude of asymptotic values for a variance to mean ratio for neutron , gamma and total detections depends on the properties ( @xmath149 ) of the system and inherent properties of the source ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "in addition , the theoretical expressions derived for evaluation of the source intensity based on asymptotic values for a variance to mean ratio and count rate for the gammas , neutrons and totals showed that totals solely can not be used for this purpose due to the strong dependence of a final formula on external parameters ( @xmath145 , @xmath142 , @xmath149 ) .",
    "however , they might be used for improving an accuracy of already evaluated values .    as a whole , numerical evaluation of the theoretical formulas showed an agreement with theoretical predictions ,",
    "although did not show an agreement with following experimental investigations for total and gamma detection .",
    "most likely the reason for this is due to the deviations between the model assumptions underlying the theory and experiments , in particular the difference between the detection process in the experimental setup and the way how the detection process is described by theory . as a possible solution one may use different type of detectors , e.g. hpge detector or cdznte . interesting",
    "to notice is that the asymptotic values of the feynman - y function and count rate for the fast neutron detections and use of the equation 40 give a good prediction of the source activity .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that for the case of gamma and total detection time of 100 seconds for measurements were sufficient to obtain results with relatively low uncertainty , while for the case of neutron detections much larger uncertainties prevail for comparable measurement times .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the new formulas for gamma and total neutron - gamma detections have a promise to complement , and in some cases replace the traditional variance to mean ( feynman - y ) formula for neutron detections .",
    "the variance to mean ( feynman - y ) formula for total neutron - gamma detections may eliminate the problem related to discrimination between neutron and gamma particles in scintillation detectors . at the same time",
    "the variance to mean ( feynman - alpha ) formula for gamma detections has a potential to be used with detectors of only gamma radiation , which is normally employed in a spent fuel pool .",
