    "the nuclear forces are very well described within the framework of su(2 ) chiral effective field theory . therefore it is natural to extend this scheme to the strangeness sector and use su(3 ) chiral effective field theory to describe the interaction between baryons , as has been done in a recent calculation of the hyperon - nucleon interaction at next - to - leading order@xcite . there",
    "the unresolved short - distance dynamics is encoded in four - baryon contact terms with _ a priori _ unknown low - energy constants .",
    "these contact terms are constructed according to the symmetries of qcd .",
    "it is not only interesting to understand baryon - baryon scattering itself , but these interactions are also input for studies of hypernuclei and hyperons in nuclear matter , such as exotic neutron star matter . especially for the few- and many - body calculations , not only two - baryon interactions , but also three - baryon interactions will play an important role.@xcite to support the",
    "recently observed two - solar - mass neutron stars@xcite , a very stiff equation of state and therefore a repulsive hyperon - nucleon force is needed . in order to achieve enough repulsion",
    ", it might be necessary to include hyperon - nucleon - nucleon three - body forces as well .",
    "as a first step the leading three - baryon contact forces have been derived and classified within su(3 ) chiral effective field theory .",
    "considering the baryon - baryon interaction , at leading order one has non - derivative four - baryon contact terms and at next - to - leading order four - baryon contact terms with two derivatives ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ct ] ) , both su(3 ) symmetric . additionally , at next - to - leading order pure baryon - baryon contact terms proportional to quark masses arise and lead to explicit su(3 ) symmetry breaking . furthermore , at next - to - leading order occur four - baryon contact terms involving one or more pseudoscalar mesons and/or external electroweak fields , cf .",
    "[ fig : ct ] .",
    "these come into play in the description of chiral many - body forces and currents relevant for few - baryon systems .    by employing the external fields method@xcite ,",
    "we have constructed a complete set of terms for the covariant chiral baryon - baryon contact lagrangian in flavor su(3 ) up to order @xmath1@xcite , which provides the above mentioned contact terms .",
    "the constructed terms are invariant under charge conjugation , parity transformation , time reversal , hermitian conjugation and local chiral transformations and include goldstone bosons as well as external fields . in the case of pure baryon - baryon interaction one obtains a minimal set of 40 terms in the chiral contact lagrangian up to @xmath2 .",
    "after a non - relativistic reduction and a decomposition into partial waves , 28 of these contact terms lead to su(3 ) symmetric contributions to the potentials for the channels @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "only one specific term leads to an antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction and therefore a spin singlet - triplet mixing .",
    "such transitions are not possible in the @xmath11 interaction without su(2 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "the remaining 12 low - energy constants contribute to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 partial waves and lead to su(3 ) symmetry breaking contributions linear in the quark masses .",
    "to describe the effect of three - body forces the full set of the leading three - baryon interactions with a minimal number of low - energy constants , consistent with the symmetries of qcd , is needed .",
    "in contrast to phenomenological approaches , we want to construct these three - baryon forces within the framework of su(3 ) chiral effective field theory ( following the construction of the chiral nuclear forces@xcite ) .",
    "we start this construction by deriving the short - range contact contribution in su(3 ) chiral effective field theory in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbbct ] .",
    "the construction of the chiral lagrangian works analogously to the construction of the four - baryon contact terms .",
    "the ( approximate ) symmetries of qcd have to be fulfilled namely charge conjugation , parity transformation , time reversal , hermitian conjugation and chiral symmetry . for the construction of the potential",
    "it is also important to include the pauli exclusion principle , since one starts with an overcomplete set of terms in the lagrangian and wants to obtain the minimal number of low - energy constants .",
    "this can be achieved by an antisymmetrization in both the initial and the final state .",
    "the pauli principle is not as restrictive as for the three - nucleon contact interaction , where one ends up with only one low - energy constant , but it is still relevant .    after constructing the pertinent terms in the chiral lagrangian and performing a non - relativistic reduction , the leading potentials can be expressed through the following operators in spin space @xmath12 for each three - baryon channel the prefactors of these spin operators are a combination of su(3 ) coefficients and low - energy constants .    as a result",
    "we have obtained that the symmetry constraints lead to 18 low - energy constants for the three - baryon contact force .",
    "table  [ tab:3bc ] gives the number of additional constants that are introduced with increasing strangeness of the three - baryon system .",
    "as an explicit example we give the form of the potentials for the @xmath0 interaction with isospin 0 and 1 : @xmath13 note that the low - energy constants for these two isospin channels are independent .",
    "the constant @xmath14 ( proportional to @xmath15 , which is present in the purely nucleonic sector @xcite ) does not appear in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 contact interaction can not be constrained by the three - nucleon sector .",
    "this work has been supported in part by dfg and nsfc ( crc110 ) and the `` tum graduate school '' .",
