    "the mechanism leading to electron pairing in copper oxide superconductors has stimulated a great deal of speculation .",
    "the manifestation of planar antiferromagnetism in the @xmath1 layers have provided motivation to study the role and importance of antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions between @xmath2 spins and their intimate relevance to superconductivity @xcite . doping with holes in these insulating cuprates results in destruction of long range order , however short range antiferromagnetic correlations between the copper moments survive .",
    "further doping leads to the emergence of a superconducting ( sc ) state .",
    "thus the interplay of af and sc phases has generated much attention .",
    "a phenomenological @xmath3 theory has attempted to unify antiferromagnetism and superconductivity owing to their proximity in the phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of the theory is that these two phases share a common microscopic origin and hence both demand treatment at an equal footing . a number of experimentally observed features , such as the vortex state , a resonant peak in sc state from neutron scattering data for optimally and underdoped samples etc .",
    "have provided ample credence to the theory . however",
    "a microscopic theory in this regard is still lacking .    a natural extrapolation of finding the connection between af and sc is the issue of their coexistence which seems more crucial and calls for attention .",
    "a large volume of work exists that focuses on the various details of the coexistence phenomenon .",
    "some of the theoretical attempts include mean field studies of and hubbard - like models which confirm the coexistence of magnetic and superconducting order @xcite .",
    "the coexistence is suggestive of the presence of short range af correlations in sc state that are probed by inelastic neutron scattering experiments via an enhanced scattering intensity near the af wavevector @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the coexistence issue has been revived recently in the context of bilayer ( and multilayer ) cuprates @xcite .",
    "while acknowledging the planar correlations perhaps dominate the physical properties of these superconductors , the role of interlayer couplings and their relevance to the coexistence phenomena for layered materials have been heavily emphasized .",
    "intimately connected to this is the question : whether the superconducting correlations originate from af spin fluctuations @xcite or via a electron - phonon mediated pairing enhanced by interlayer tunneling@xcite .",
    "however both these mechanisms can not be operative together .",
    "the next fundamental question is the symmetry of the superconducting gap function . even with sufficient experimental evidence for a @xmath5 pairing for a planar materials ( for a comprehensive review on the subject see ref .  ) , for bilayers the pairing symmetry is still unclear .",
    "several variational calculations @xcite performed over the years have provided nourishment to a @xmath5-wave pairing scenario and a reasonably broad window of carrier concentration has been identified in planar systems where magnetic and sc order coexist .",
    "similar studies in the context of bilayers are lacking and hence provide motivation for us to investigate a bilayer model via variational monte carlo ( vmc ) technique .",
    "our goal in this work is to examine the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in bilayers using vmc and to study the magnetic and superconducting correlation in the variational ground state .",
    "we further intend to investigate the dependence of these properties on interlayer coupling strengths . in a recent paper@xcite , to determine the most suitable pairing symmetry of the sc state in bilayers we investigated the stability of various pairing symmetries , e.g. ( a ) @xmath6 ( @xmath0-wave ) , ( b ) @xmath7 and ( c ) @xmath8 .",
    "another function discussed in connection with bilayer materials but not included in our previous study is the @xmath9 state ( @xmath10 with ` @xmath11 ' sign for @xmath12 and ` @xmath13 ' for @xmath14 ) which has @xmath15-wave symmetry and opposite signs in the bonding ( @xmath12 ) and antibonding bands ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "this state possesses the merit of explaining the resonance peak at 41 @xmath16 obtained in neutron scattering experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider also this pairing symmetry in the search for most stable ground state in bilayers .    here",
    "we state the main results obtained by us .",
    "the long range af order coexists with superconductivity in the underdoped regime . in the coexisting phase not only the af but sc correlations are also significantly stronger as compared to that in the pure sc ( @xmath0-wave ) state .",
    "larger interlayer hopping frequency reduces planar sc correlations in the optimally doped phase whereas it enhances it in the overdoped regime , while the effect of interlayer exchange on sc correlations is minimal for the range of the parameter values considered in our paper .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : section ii introduces the model for bilayers and discusses the most suitable variational wavefunction to be used for our calculations .",
    "a brief note on the numerics used and an elaborate discussion on the results appear in section iii .",
    "the effects of interplanar coupling parameters have been emphasized in magnetic , superconducting and the coexisting phase .",

    "the hamiltonian for a bilayer can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the planar hopping and exchange integral respectively , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding interplanar parameters . @xmath22",

    "simulations are performed on a bilayered lattice of size .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the stability of different phases with different sc pairing symmetries , followed by the results for magnetic and superconducting correlations .",
    "we show that the af and sc phases coexist in the underdoped regime by comparing the optimal energy of the variational wavefunction having pure sc correlations with the one having coexisting af and sc order . to characterize the pure sc and the coexisting phase and to enumerate the differences in their properties",
    ", we compute the correlation functions for both these phases and make a detailed comparison between the two .",
    "we first consider the pure sc wavefunction ( obtained by putting @xmath59 in eq .",
    "[ eq : variational_wf ] ) . as for the pairing symmetry of the sc state , we considered energies of four different variational wavefunctions listed in the previous section . an earlier work @xcite investigates in details the first three wavefunctions in the list and found that the pure @xmath0-wave state yields lowest energy at all values of @xmath69 away from half filling .",
    "this led to the conclusion that of the three pairing symmetries discussed there , a planar @xmath0-wave state is most appropriate in the context of a bilayer .",
    "we have included the @xmath9-state for comparison with the existing ones in the light of the emphasis given to it where it is claimed to be more stable than that of the @xmath0-wave state for the bilayered systems and is capable of explaining the origin of the neutron scattering peak observed experimentally in @xmath70 at temperatures below @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "however our vmc calculations indicate that the energy of the @xmath9 pairing state to be actually higher than the normal state at all values of hole concentrations .",
    "thus we discard this pairing symmetry from the list of possible candidates and conclude that a planar @xmath0-wave state is most appropriate to study superconductivity in bilayers .      before we proceed to calculate physical quantities , such as the ground state energy etc . , it is somewhat interesting to look at the variation of the optimal superconducting variational parameter , @xmath72 , as a function of hole concentration for a few representative values of the interplanar coupling parameters . the choices of these parameters are chosen from experimental data @xcite .    from fig .  1",
    "it may be noticed that the critical hole concentration , @xmath73 at which @xmath72 vanishes , increases ( from @xmath74 to @xmath75 ) with larger interplanar hopping , @xmath20 , while the interplanar exchange , @xmath21 has no significant effect on @xmath73 . below @xmath73 , @xmath72 is slightly reduced by both higher values of @xmath76 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that in a two dimensional square lattice ( with same values for the planar parameters ) , a @xmath0-wave state is stabilized upto @xmath77 hole concentration@xcite , which is lower than the corresponding value _",
    "i.e. _ 34% obtained here for the bilayer ( fig .  1 )",
    ". thus stability of the superconducting state extends upto _ higher _ values of hole concentration in bilayers than in planar materials .",
    "next we introduce the second variational parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath51 into the problem and carry out minimization of energy in two - variational parameters space , @xmath57 and @xmath51 .",
    "the calculation shows that the energy is significantly lowered in the underdoped regime ( @xmath78 ) when compared to that obtained for the pure sc state .",

    "a feature also observed for the two dimensional model@xcite .",
    "this is one of the key results of our paper .",
    "similar energy difference of the two phases are found for other choices of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( as appear in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we first examine the magnetic correlations in the pure @xmath0-wave state .",
    "the relevant quantities to compute are planar spin - spin correlations , @xmath83 and the corresponding fourier transform , @xmath84 , called as the structure factor which is defined as , @xmath85 the real - space correlations ( fig .",

    "it may be noted that the @xmath0-wave state does not show long range magnetic order also in two dimensional systems . as for the interplanar correlations ,",
    "the @xmath0-wave shows af ordering between the spins in the two layers , however the correlations are found to be very weak .",

    "[ sf2:spincorr_wfsc ] , we plot @xmath84 as a function of @xmath87 , the points being chosen along a symmetry path for @xmath88 equal to both @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the peak in @xmath84 at @xmath91 indicates the existence of antiferromagnetic correlations in the lattice .",
    "however , the peak at @xmath92 is of comparable magnitude to that at @xmath91 , which corroborates the presence of weak interplanar correlations mentioned earlier @xcite .",
    "away from half - filling , both planar and interplanar spin correlations are found to vanish rapidly with hole doping .",
    "other values for the interplanar parameters among the ones considered here are found to have little impact on spin correlations except for a small reduction of planar correlations by larger interplanar hopping away from half filling .",
    "the value of staggered structure factor , @xmath93 at half - filling for the @xmath0-wave state is obtained as @xmath94 .",
    "this value may be compared with the exact diagonalization results for a bilayer model@xcite which yields an estimate for @xmath93 to be @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( same corresponding value is used in fig .",
    "[ fig : spincorr_wfsc ] ) at half filling@xcite .",
    "thus the staggered magnetization for the pure @xmath0-wave state obtained in our calculations is far lower than that obtained via exact diagonalization studies .",
    "this large discrepancy can be attributed mainly to the absence of interlayer magnetic correlations for the pure @xmath0-wave state .",
    "next we discuss the magnetic correlations in the coexisting af and @xmath0-wave sc state which is lower in energy than that of the pure @xmath0-wave sc state in the underdoped region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spincorr_wfafsc ] , we show the planar and interplanar spin correlations both at and away from half - filling .    the correlations are clearly much stronger in this case than for the pure @xmath0-wave state .",
    "the interplanar correlations , which was very weak in the @xmath0-wave state , is almost of the same magnitude as the planar correlations .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of correlations does not seem to decay with distance at and even slightly away from half - filling .",
    "however , at larger values of @xmath69 , the magnetic correlations decay rapidly with distance as seen for @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spincorr_wfafsc ] .",
    "the energy calculations also provide a support for this result where it is found that the kinetic energy dominates over the exchange energy and consequently the antiferromagnetic phase disappears corresponding to @xmath98 .",

    "[ fig : ssf_wfafsc ] .    the sharp peaks in @xmath84 at @xmath100 for small values of hole doping ( fig .  [ sf1:ssf_wfafsc ] ) indicates the existence strong af long range correlations in the system .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath93 at half - filling is @xmath101 which is considerably larger than that obtained for the pure sc state and is comparable to the exact diagonalization value ( _ viz . _ @xmath102 ) mentioned earlier @xcite .",
    "thus the support for the coexisting phase becomes more robust .",
    "also @xmath93 decreases with increasing hole concentration as the magnetic correlations are weakened by the mobile holes . for @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ sf2:ssf_wfafsc ] ) , it is observed that @xmath84 increases with increasing hole concentration , the increase being maximum at @xmath92 .",

    "however @xmath104 ( fig  [ sf4:ssf_tz_jz ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that interplanar af correlations are strengthened by larger @xmath21 , while the planar correlations are almost unaffected .",
    "this agrees with exact diagonalization results obtained for the bilayer model @xcite .",
