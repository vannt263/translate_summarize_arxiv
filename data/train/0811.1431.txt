    "star formation is one of the most fundamental processes of the evolution of galaxies .",
    "stars are formed by the contraction of molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) , and then a new ism containing heavy element is dispersed into interstellar space by stellar wind and supernova explosions when stars end their lives . by repeating these processes , ism , galaxies , and the universe evolve .",
    "therefore , the physics of star formation is very important in the understanding of the evolution of galaxies .    in the central regions of disk galaxies",
    ", we often find intense star - formation activities ( e.g. , @xcite ) where not only the star formation rate ( sfr ) but also the star formation efficiency ( sfe ; @xcite ) , which is an intensive parameter defined as the fraction of the sfr surface density in the surface mass density of molecular gas , are also enhanced .",
    "these star formation activities in central regions of galaxies are different from a simply scaled - up version of that in the disk region , and it is are referred to as starburst @xcite . the nuclear starburst is prominent not only because they show high sfr but also because they show elevated sfe .",
    "therefore , for understanding the nuclear starburst we should reveal what causes the high sfe star formation .",
    "it is essential to study _ dense _ molecular gas , because stars are formed from the dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "in fact , recent studies of the dense molecular medium in galaxies based on the observations in the hcn(@xmath1 ) emission , a dense molecular gas tracer ( @xmath3 @xmath4 a few @xmath5 @xmath6 ) due to its large dipole moment ( @xmath11 debye , whereas @xmath12 debye ) , demonstrate the intimate connection between dense molecular gas and massive star formation in galaxies . after the pioneer work by @xcite ,",
    "a tight correlation between the hcn(@xmath1 ) intensity and fir continuum luminosities has been shown among many galaxies including nearby ones ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and high redshift quasar host galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although some deviations from the correlation are reported toward extreme environments ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . a spatial coincidence between dense molecular gas traced by the hcn(@xmath1 ) emission and massive star - forming regions",
    "was also reported ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that hcn(@xmath1)/co(@xmath1 ) integrated intensity ratio in the brightness temperature scale , hereafter @xmath8 , correlates well with sfe .",
    "this suggests that sfe is controlled by the fraction of dense molecular gas to the total amount of molecular contents traced by @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    however , these previous reports on the relationship between dense gas fraction and sfe are derived from coarse spatial resolution ( @xmath13 ) data of moderately distant galaxies ( @xmath14 mpc ) .",
    "it means the results show a correlation on global scales of galaxies . in our galaxy , a massive star - forming region",
    "is associated with the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) or their associations ( giant molecular associations ; gmas ) .",
    "a typical scale of a gmc is a few 10 pc ( @xcite ) and that of a gma is a few 100 pc .",
    "therefore , we should investigate a correlation between dense gas fraction and sfe on this scale . to address this issue ,",
    "observations with high - angular resolution of the central region of nearby galaxies are required .    in this paper",
    ", we present co(@xmath1 ) , hcn(@xmath1 ) , and 95  ghz continuum observations toward the central regions of m  83 ( ngc  5236 ) using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "m  83 is a nearby , face - on , barred , grand - design spiral galaxy hosting an intense starburst at its center .",
    "the distance to m  83 is estimated to be 4.5 mpc @xcite ; therefore , 1@xmath15 corresponds to 22 pc .",
    "we can then discuss the relation between @xmath8 and the sfe at the center of m  83 on a gma scale with a few arcsec resolution observations , which can be accomplished with the nma .",
    "the high - resolution ( @xmath16 23@xmath15 @xmath2 500 pc ) co line observations of the central region of m  83 have been performed repeatedly with various telescopes and in various transitions .",
    "we summarized them in table  1 .",
    "for example , @xcite mapped the distribution of co(@xmath1 ) emission for the center and bar at a resolution of @xmath17 using the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "they observed a large concentration of molecular gas in the nucleus and an extended ridge along the major axis of the bar .",
    "@xcite reported the co(@xmath1 ) observation toward the center with the nma .",
    "the distribution of co(@xmath1 ) emission shows twin peak structure at the nucleus . @xcite",
    "performed co(@xmath18 ) and co(@xmath19 ) emission observations toward the center and the bar using the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "their co maps revealed two gas ridges on the leading side of the stellar bar and a nuclear gas ring of @xmath2 300 pc in diameter .",

    "thus , the optical light is extinct by a factor of 100 around the hcn(@xmath1 ) peak .",
    "in addition , the peak of the extinction - corrected h@xmath23 luminosity coincides well with those of the @xmath38 and the co(@xmath1 ) line , the hcn(@xmath1 ) line , and the 95  ghz continuum emission . on the other hand ,",
    "extinction is almost negligible to the south of the center .",
    "this inhomogeneous extinction shows why the optical starburst is clearly visible to the south of the center but almost invisible in the north side .",
    "this suggests the existence of deeply buried ongoing starburst with strong extinction , which is already reported by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , near the peaks in the hcn(@xmath1 ) line and the 95  ghz continuum emission .",
    "( 160mm,171mm)figure-9.eps      in order to discuss the relationship between dense molecular gas and star formation , we estimate the sfr in the central @xmath50 ( @xmath2 500 pc ) region of m  83 .",
    "we used various sfr indicators , i.e. our 95  ghz ( 3 mm ) continuum emission , 5 ghz ( 6 cm ) continuum emission , infrared ( ir ) luminosity , and extinction - corrected h@xmath23 luminosity .",
    "all of them should be consistent when all corrections are applied properly .",
    "continuum emission at 95  ghz is expected to be an extinction - free tracer of sfr .",
    "this is because continuum emission in this wavelength is dominated by thermal free - free emission , and is therefore directly converted to the lyman photon rate @xcite .    by assuming that the observed 95  ghz continuum is dominated by the thermal free - free emission",
    ", a lyman continuum rate or h@xmath23 luminosity can be evaluated by the following formula ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the distance to the galaxy , @xmath41 is the electron temperature , @xmath53 is the frequency , and @xmath54 is the flux density of the thermal free - free continuum emission . we assume that the observed 95  ghz continuum flux within the central @xmath50 region of m  83 , @xmath54 = 30 mjy , is dominated by the thermal free - free continuum emission .",
    "then , we derived @xmath55(95  ghz ) = 9.2 @xmath22 @xmath56 erg s@xmath29 . using this @xmath55(95  ghz ) , we can derive an sfr by adopting the relation between @xmath57 luminosity and sfr ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath58 the resultant sfr from our 95  ghz continuum flux is 0.73 @xmath25 0.21 @xmath59 .",
    "the error is estimated from the signal - to - noise(s / n ) ratio of the 95  ghz continuum map .      in order to evaluate the validity of the derived sfr from 95  ghz continuum flux , we computed the sfr from ir luminosity and 5 ghz radio continuum flux . according to @xcite , the sfr derived from ir luminosity within the central 22@xmath15 region is 0.37 @xmath59 , which is almost half the value of the sfr based on the 95  ghz continuum .",

    "recently , the spitzer / mips 24 @xmath63 m image has begun to be employed for calibration of sfr ( e.g. m  51 ; @xcite ) .",
    "an archival mips 24 @xmath63 m image ( p00059 , george , rieke , starburst activity in nearby galaxies ) covers the entire disk of m  83 , and the spatial resolution of the image is about 5@xmath15.7 .",

    "at the center of m  83 , h@xmath23 extinction derived from mips 24 @xmath63 m image is about 3 mag at a resolution of 5@xmath15.7 .",
    "considering the difference in spatial resolution , the derived h@xmath23 extinction from mips 24 @xmath63 m image seems to be consistent with that from the pa@xmath23 image .",
