    "<S> low - scale string models , in which the string scale @xmath0 is of the order of tev with large extra dimensions , can solve the problems of scale hierarchy and non - renormalizable quantum gravity in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> string excited states of the standard model particles are possibly observed as resonances in the dijet invariant mass distribution at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> there are two properties to distinguish whether the resonances are due to low - scale string or some other  new physics \" . </S>",
    "<S> one is a characteristic angular distribution in dijet events at the resonance due to spin degeneracy of string excited states , and the other is an appearance of the second resonance at a characteristic mass of second string excited states . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a possibility to observe these evidences of low - scale string models by monte carlo simulations with a reference value of @xmath1 at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that spin degeneracy at the dijet resonance can be observed by looking the @xmath3-distribution with integrated luminosity of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the second resonance can be observed at rather close to the first resonance in the dijet invariant mass distribution with integrated luminosity of @xmath5 . </S>",
