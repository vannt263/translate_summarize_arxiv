    "the spectral theory of pencils of linear operators has a long history , with contributions by distinguished people including krein , langer , gohberg , pontryagin and shkalikov .",
    "it has many applications , for example to control theory , mathematical physics and vibrating structures .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for accounts of this subject and extensive bibliographies . among the theoretical tools that have been developed to study some such problems",
    "is the theory of krein spaces , which also has a long history , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is also a substantial numerical literature on self - adjoint linear and quadratic pencils , @xcite .",
    "an interesting physically motivated example with some unusual features has recently been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that self - adjoint pencils may have complex eigenvalues .",
    "if the pencil depends on a real parameter @xmath0 in addition to the spectral parameter , which we always call @xmath2 , one often sees two real eigenvalues of the pencil meeting at a square root singularity as @xmath0 changes , and then emerging as a complex conjugate pair , or vice versa .",
    "however , little has been written about the distribution of the complex eigenvalues , and the unexpected phenomena revealed in this paper show how hard a full understanding is likely to be .",
    "some of these phenomena may disappear when studying suitable infinite - dimensional pencils of differential operators , but , if so , the reason for this will need to be explained .    the paper studies the simplest , non - trivial example of a finite - dimensional , self - adjoint , linear pencil , and in particular the asymptotic distribution of its non - real eigenvalues as the dimension increases . our main results are presented in theorem  [",

    "however , a number of other cases exhibiting further complexities are also considered .",
    "numerical studies indicate that some of the phenomena described here occur for a much larger class of pencils , including the case in which the matrix @xmath3 defined in is indefinite and has slowly varying coefficients on each of the two subintervals concerned . proving this is a task for the future .    a self - adjoint , linear pencil of @xmath4 matrices is defined to be a family of matrices of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are self - adjoint @xmath7 matrices and @xmath8 . the number @xmath9 is said to be an _ eigenvalue _ of this pencil @xmath10 if @xmath11 is not invertible , or equivalently if @xmath12 has a non - zero solution @xmath13 .",
    "the _ spectrum _ of the pencil @xmath10 is the set of all its eigenvalues , and will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "it coincides with the set of all roots of the polynomial @xmath15 we always assume that @xmath3 is invertible , so that @xmath16 is a polynomial of degree @xmath17 with non - zero leading coefficient .",
    "the spectrum of the pencil equals that of the matrix @xmath18 , which is generically non - self - adjoint . in the standard case",
    "when @xmath3 is the identity matrix , the spectrum of the pencil @xmath19 coincides with the spectrum of the matrix @xmath20 , which we also denote by @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum of such a self - adjoint pencil is real if either @xmath20 or @xmath3 is a definite matrix , i.e.  all of its eigenvalues have the same sign .",
    "if both @xmath20 and @xmath3 are sign - indefinite matrices the problem is said to be indefinite , and it is known that the spectrum may then be complex .",
    "numerical studies show that the eigenvalues of an indefinite self - adjoint pencil often lie on or under a small set of curves .",
    "theorems  [ th : c=0 ] and [ th : asymptcne0 ] prove that this is true in two cases , and determine the curves asymptotically as @xmath22 .",
    "the analysis reduces to proving a similar statement for a certain class of large sparse polynomials .",
