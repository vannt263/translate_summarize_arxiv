    "the quadratic variation , or the pathwise volatility , of stochastic processes is ofparamount importance in mathematical finance . indeed",
    ", it was the major discovery of the celebrated article by black and scholes @xcite that the prices of financial derivatives depend only on the volatility of the underlying asset . in the black ",
    "scholes model of geometric brownian motion , the volatility simply means the variance .",
    "later the brownian model was extended to more general semimartingale models .",
    "delbaen and schachermayer @xcite gave the final word on the pricing of financial derivatives with semimartingales .",
    "in all these models , the volatility simply meant the variance or the semimartingale quadratic variance .",
    "now , due to the important article by fllmer @xcite , it is clear that the variance is not the volatility .",
    "instead , one should consider the pathwise quadratic variation .",
    "this revelation and its implications to mathematical finance has been studied , for example , in @xcite .",
    "an important class of pricing models is the mixed brownian ",
    "fractional brownian model .",
    "this is a model where the quadratic variation is determined by the brownian part and the correlation structure is determined by the fractional brownian part .",
    "thus , this is a pricing model that captures the long - range dependence while leaving the black ",
    "scholes pricing formulas intact .",
    "the mixed brownian ",
    "fractional brownian model has been studied in the pricing context , for example , in @xcite .    by the hedging paradigm",
    "the prices and hedges of financial derivative depend only on the pathwise quadratic variation of the underlying process .",
    "consequently , the statistical estimation of the quadratic variation is an important problem .",
    "one way to estimate the quadratic variation is to use directly its definition by the so - called _ realized quadratic variation_. although the consistency result ( see  [ rqv-1 ] ) does not depend on a specific choice of the sampling scheme , the asymptotic distribution does .",
    "there are numerous articles that study the asymptotic behavior of realized quadratic variation ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "another approach , suggested by dzhaparidze and spreij @xcite , is to use the randomized periodogram estimator . in @xcite , the case of semimartingales",
    "was studied . in @xcite ,",
    "the randomized periodogram estimator was studied for the mixed brownian ",
