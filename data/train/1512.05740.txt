    "the interaction between optical photons in vacuum is extremely weak , an effective interaction between photons must be mediated by matter to create the required phase shift .",

    "one promising strategy is to couple an optical resonator to an atom , an atomic ensemble , or a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "another possible implementation is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . but for eit with low - lying atomic states , the single - photon phase shifts measured to date are on the order of @xmath1 rad @xcite , which is much too small .",
    "it has been proposed to build a photon - photon gate by applying a small controlled phase shift to an ancillary coherent pulse with a large mean photon number @xcite .",
    "but the best performance achieved so far @xcite produced a phase shift of 18 @xmath2rad at a single - shot resolution for a measurement of the ancilla phase of 50 mrad , which is several orders of magnitude away from the goal .",

    "two of these experiments @xcite measured self - phase modulation of a single continuous wave ( cw ) light field .",
    "but deterministic optical qip requires that one light field controls another .",
    "the other two experiments @xcite measured cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) that one cw light field creates for another cw light field . however , an extension of these xpm experiments from cw light to a single photon , which must inherently be pulsed , is hampered by the fact that to spectrally resolve the two pulses , the pulses would need a duration exceeding the typical time scale of the xpm , given by the resonator decay time . moreover , there is a no - go theorem @xcite which claims that it is impossible to achieve deterministic optical qip based on a large single - photon xpm .",
    "here we show that the shortcomings of the existing experiments can be overcome by storing a control light pulse in a medium , letting a target light pulse propagate through the medium , and eventually retrieving the stored control excitation , similar to a proposal in ref .",

    "to summarize , we implemented a scheme in which a control pulse containing one photon imprinted a phase shift onto a target light field and measured a controlled phase shift of 3.3 rad .",
    "our implementation offers a realistic possibility to be extended to building a photon - photon quantum gate in a future application . as",
    "the @xmath67 polarization is no longer needed as a phase reference when operating the gate , the polarization state of the target signal pulse would immediately be available as one of the qubits .",
    "we emphasize that the phase coherence properties of this qubit have already been explored in our present work by measuring the visibility .",
    "the control qubit could be a dual - rail qubit @xcite consisting of two beams propagating parallel to each other in the same atomic cloud with a relative distance larger than the blockade radius , such that the target beam overlaps with only one of the rails .",
    "on the input and output side , the dual - rail qubit could conveniently be mapped onto a polarization qubit as in ref .",

    "a related experiment was simultaneously performed at mit @xcite .",
    "the dipole trap consists of a horizontal laser beam with a wavelength of 1064 nm , a waist of 140 @xmath2 m , and a power of 3.2 w. this causes negligible axial confinement along the @xmath8 axis and a measured radial trapping frequency of 90 hz .",
    "in addition , we use two light beams with a wavelength of 532 nm , waists of 25 @xmath2 m , and powers of 0.10 w each .",
    "these ` plug ' beams perpendicularly intersect the dipole trapping beam and provide a box - like potential along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "the distance between the centers of the two plug beams is @xmath77 @xmath2 m .",
    "after carefully leveling the direction of the 1064 nm beam relative to gravity , the overall configuration creates a medium that is axially to a good approximation homogeneous . using a polarizability of @xmath78 a.u .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath79 state at 1064 nm , where 1 atomic unit ( a.u . ) equals @xmath80 j(m / v)@xmath81 , we estimate a radial root - mean - square cloud size of @xmath82 @xmath2 m .",
    "using @xmath83 a.u .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath79 state at 532 nm , we estimate an axial fwhm cloud size of @xmath73 @xmath2 m .",
    "note that @xmath57 is smaller than @xmath84 because the atomic temperature is much below the barrier height created by the plug beams .",
    "the radial inhomogeneity of the medium has little effect because @xmath85 .",
    "a magnetic field of @xmath86100 @xmath2 t is applied along the @xmath8 axis to stabilize the orientation of the atomic spins .",
    "the two plug beams are generated by sending one light beam into an acousto - optic modulator driven with the sum of two sinusoidal radio frequency ( rf ) fields , thus generating two first - order diffracted output light beams .",
    "this makes @xmath84 and hence @xmath57 easily adjustable by changing the frequencies of the rf fields .",
    "the dipole trap is loaded from a magnetic trap . before the transfer , the atomic cloud is cigar shaped with the @xmath87 axis as the symmetry axis .",
    "after the transfer , the cloud is also cigar shaped but with the @xmath8 axis as the symmetry axis .",
    "this transfer from one elongated trap into another perpendicularly elongated trap is nontrivial .",
    "it turns out that the atom number fluctuations added by the transfer are minimized , if we first slowly ramp up another 1064 nm dipole - trapping beam propagating along the @xmath88 axis which forces the cloud into an almost spherical shape during transfer .",
    "second , we slowly ramp up the dipole trapping beam along the @xmath8 axis together with the plug beams .",
    "third , we slowly ramp down the magnetic trap and , finally , we slowly ramp down the dipole - trapping beam along the @xmath88 axis .    the 480-nm coupling light creates a repulsive potential which is added to the dipole trap potential .",
    "the coupling light is on for only few microseconds and the experiment is repeated every 100 @xmath2s .",
    "this low duty cycle is chosen because it makes the effect of the repulsive potential negligible , as in refs .",

    "one out of three polarization measurement bases is chosen .",
    "these bases are horizontal / vertical ( h / v ) , diagonal / anti - diagonal ( d / a ) , and left / right circular ( l / r ) .",
    "combination of these measurements yields the normalized stokes parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the light power in polarization @xmath94 .",
    "the normalized stokes parameters contain the complete information about the polarization state of the light .",
    "we express the normalized stokes vector in spherical coordinates as @xmath95 .",
    "hence , we obtain radius @xmath96 , polar angle @xmath97 , and azimuth @xmath61 .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "thus the tomography yields @xmath37 .",
    "alternatively , one could , in principle , determine the azimuth @xmath61 by measuring in many bases with linear polarizations which include various angles @xmath99 with the horizontal polarization .",

    "the ratio of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the input polarization was chosen to maximize @xmath75 for the measurement of @xmath65 .",
    "if the propagating target excitation and the stored control excitation have a relative distance @xmath104 , then their van der waals potential is @xmath105 . for small @xmath104",
    ", this creates rydberg blockade . in our experiment",
    ", the positive sign of @xmath106 implies an attractive van der waals interaction which lowers the energy of the rydberg pair state . at fixed detuning @xmath107 of the eit - coupling laser ,",
    "the eit feature is therefore shifted to smaller signal detuning @xmath26 , i.e.  further to the left in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra]b .",
    "this is advantageous because there is no radius @xmath104 at which the left side of the eit feature , where the phase shift is large and positive , would appear at @xmath27 mhz .",
    "hence , when continuously decreasing @xmath104 from infinity to near zero , @xmath108 as a function of radius starts out at the value relevant for fig .  [ fig - spectra]b and monotonically approaches the value relevant for fig .",

    "had we reversed the signs of @xmath26 and @xmath107 , then for decreasing @xmath104 , @xmath108 would first overshoot to large positive values at the raman resonance before settling down to the value relevant for fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra]d .",
