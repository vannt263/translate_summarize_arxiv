    "the study of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) has been greatly expanded by the high spatial resolution and spectral grasp of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories , respectively .",
    "ulx sources ( fabbiano & white 2003 ; miller & colbert 2004 ) have 210  kev x - ray luminosities exceeding @xmath1 and are found some distance from the centres of galaxies ; they are not active galactic nuclei .",
    "their luminosity exceeds that for a @xmath2 black hole accreting at the eddington limit which radiates isotropically and so have created much interest in the possibility that they contain even higher mass black holes , such as intermediate black holes ( imbh ) of @xmath3 ( makishima et al 2000 ; miller , fabian & miller 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively they may appear so luminous because of beaming ( reynolds et al 1999 ; king et al 2001 , zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) or due to super eddington accretion ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "ulx are most common in starburst galaxies and in very active star - forming regions , such as in the antennae and the cartwheel galaxy , where populations of tens of them are found ( zezas et al 2002 ; gao et al 2003 ; wolter & trinchieri 2004 ) . in some cases variability rules out the possibility that they are just clusters of lower - luminosity objects .",
    "the origin of imbh is unclear .",
    "they may form as a result of binary interactions in dense stellar environments ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "a comparison of imbh ulx candidates with a number of well known stellar - mass black holes candidates ( bhc ; miller et al 2004 ) demonstrates that the ulx are more luminous but have cooler thermal disk components than standard stellar - mass bhc .",
    "therefore , ulx in this sample are clearly different from the sample of stellar - mass bhc and are consistent with being imbh .    here",
    "we report on the discovery of a population of 8 point x - ray sources to the n of the nucleus of ngc1275 , which is the central galaxy in the perseus cluster .",
    "all exceed @xmath1 in x - ray luminosity , and 7 are formally ulx , if they are at the distance of the cluster .",
    "the spatial region where they lie coincides with the high velocity system of ngc1275 .",
    "we assume that they are part of that system .",
    "we see no other point sources ( apart from the nucleus ) over the body of ngc1275 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "ngc1275 is embedded in a complex multiphase environment .",
    "optical imaging and spectroscopy first established the existence of two distinct emission - line system toward ngc1275 : a low - velocity component associated with the galaxy itself at 5200 km @xmath4 and a high - velocity component at 8200 km @xmath4 projected nearby on the sky ( minkowski 1955 , 1957 ) .",
    "this latter component is associated with a small gas - rich galaxy falling into the cluster along our line of sight ( haschick , crane & van der hulst 1982 ) .",
    "a merger scenario has been proposed ( minkowski 1955 , 1957 ) . however , interaction of the low and/or high - velocity system with a third gas - rich galaxy or system of galaxies ( holtzman et al . 1992 ; conselice , gallagher & wyse 2001 ) , or influences from the surrounding dense intracluster medium ( icm ) ( sarazin 1988 ; boroson 1990 ; caulet et al .",
    "1992 ) have been discussed .",
    "deep _ chandra _ observations have clarified the position of the high velocity system ( hvs ) .",
    "the depth of the observed x - ray absorption ( e.g. fig .",
    "1 ) is nor infilled by emission from hot gas projected along the line - of - sight so the hvs must lie well in front of ngc1275 .",
    "gillmon , sanders & fabian ( 2004 ) have estimated a lower limit on the distance of the hvs from the nucleus of 57 kpc .",
    "the low- and high - velocity system are therefore not yet directly interacting .",
    "the hvs @xmath5 however strongly interacting with the icm of the perseus cluster , which has triggered strong star formation . in this paper",
    "we describe the detailed analysis of the x - ray spatial and spectral properties of the discrete sources in the high velocity system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect . 2 and 3 we present reduction and results from the imaging analysis and spectral analysis , respectively ; in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the results ; and sect .",
    "5 summarizes our findings .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a redshift of 0.018 and @xmath6 .",
    "this gives a luminosity distance to the cluster of 80 mpc ; 1 arcsec corresponds to a physical distance of 370  pc .",
    "the _ chandra _ datasets included in this analysis are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the total exposure time , after removing periods containing flares , is 890  ks . to prepare the data for analysis , all of the datasets were reprocessed to use the latest appropriate gain file ( acisd2000 - 01 - 29gain_ctin0003 ) .",
    "the datasets analysed each used an aimpoint on the acis - s3 ccd .",
    "the datasets were filtered using the lightcurve in the 2.5 to 7  kev band on acis - s1 ccd , which is a back - illuminated ccd like the acis - s3 .",
    "the ciao lc_clean tool was used to remove periods 20 per  cent away from the median count rate for all the lightcurves .",
    "this procedure was not used for datasets 03209 and 04289 which did not include the s1 ccd , however no flares were seen in these observations on the s3 ccd .",
    "each of the observations was reprojected to match the coordinate system of the 04952 observation .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab : luminosities ] we list the 0.5 - 7  kev flux and ( absorption corrected ) luminosities of the individual sources based on the best - fit power law model .    the lower limit of the luminosity of point sources in the image , if at the distance of ngc1275 , is @xmath7 , which is already well above the eddington limit for a neutron star binary ( @xmath8 ) and is also above the limit of canonical ulx , i.e. @xmath9 .    the brightest point source has a luminosity of @xmath10 , and is one of the brightest individual sources found in a galaxy .",
    "a ulx source more luminous than the entire x - ray luminosity of a normal galaxy has been found in the cartwheel system with a luminosity of at least @xmath11 ( gao et al .",
    "2003 ; wolter & trinchieri 2004 ) .",
    "they explain this luminosity with a high - mass x - ray binary source ( hmxb ) .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity suggests either a single extremely bright source , or a very dense collection of several high @xmath12 sources , which would be even more peculiar .",
    "evidence of time variability might suggest that is a single high @xmath12 source .",
    "time variability analysis has been performed .",
    "the observations span about two years .",
    "two data files were observed on 2002 august 8 and 10 , and the other eleven data files were observed from 2004 october 4 to 2004 october 20 , giving an almost daily coverage .",
    "the exposure times are between 22 and 143 ks .",
    "the data characteristics allows us determine short variation in 16 days ( second period ) and long - term variability of 2 years . because of the low count rates of the sources in ngc1275 ( see table [ tab : positions ] ) , it is very hard to search for short - term variability .",
    "we extracted light - curves , using dmextract ciao task for the two brightest sources ( n3 and n4 ) ( net count rate greater than 0.98 count @xmath4 ) binned with bin sizes of 500 , 1000 , 2500 and 5000 s. in both cases the points were consistent with the respective mean values and variability has not been found . furthermore , the mean values between 2002 and 2004 are the same , including errors bars",
    ". therefore , evidence of time variability has not been found during the whole set of observations .",
    "_ chandra _ has revealed significant populations of ulx in the interacting systems of the antennae ( ngc 4038/9 ; zezas , fabbiano & murray 2002 ) and the cartwheel ring galaxy ( gao et al .",
    "2003 ; wolter & trinchieri 2004 ) , where dramatic events have stimulated massive star formation .",
    "we have reported here on another example ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure ] left ) in the hvs of ngc1275 which is interacting with the icm of the perseus cluster .",
    "the sources are spatially associated with the distribution of absorbing clouds seen in soft x - ray ( fig .  2 ) and optical ( fig .",
    "3 ) images .",
    "two sources ( n7 and n8 ) are directly linked with dust knots and another two ( n2 and n6 ) have an optical point - like counterpart ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure ] _ bottom _ ) .",
    "similar correspondence have been found in the cartwheel galaxy with the outer ring ( wolter & trinchieri 2004 ) and in the antennae galaxies with 39 x - ray sources within the wfpc2 field ( zezas et al .",
    "the optical brightness of the counterparts in the hvc are too high to be individual stars and so may be associated with young star clusters . following the discussion of young star clusters in ncg1275 given by richer et",
    "al ( 1993 ) , an object of magnitude 22 corresponds to a cluster mass of about @xmath13 if its age is about @xmath14 .",
    "the hvc system travels at least 30  kpc in @xmath14 so if a strong interaction with the core of the perseus galaxy cluster has triggered star cluster formation in the hvc , then the clusters should have ages less than @xmath15 .",
    "our interpretation of the spatial correspondence with star clusters is that the regions are especially active , indicating a real link between ulx and star - forming regions , and meaning they are young objects .",
    "however the optical limits on sources n3 and 4 rule out any association with massive clusters in those cases ( the limit on the absolute magnitude is about @xmath16 ) .    in m31 and the milky way ( grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2003 ) , xrb have luminosities consistent with the eddington limit of a @xmath17 accreting object .",
    "they produce luminosities @xmath18 , about one order of magnitude below the limiting luminosity in our sample ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is possible that our ulx consist of at least 15 ( or 130 , in the case of the brightest source found ) ` normal ' xrb clustered together , perhaps in a young star cluster .",
    "however in other objects we know that variability requires the presence of intrinsically luminous x - ray sources ( e.g. m82 ; griffiths et al .",
    "2000 , kaaret et al .",
    "alternative possibilities are that black hole sources , with masses in the range of galactic black hole binaries , are mildly beamed ( reynolds et al . 1999 and king et al . 2001 ) .",
    "spectral and timing features however rule out this possibility in some ulx ( e.g. strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) .",
    "we note that compact supernova remnants sometimes have ulx luminosities ( e.g. fabian & terlevich 1998 ) , but no recent supernovae have been reported for ngc1275 ( sn1968a was to the s of the hvs ; capetti 2002 ) .",
    "finally , we recall the imbh model which has spectral support from some sources ( miller et al 2004 ; the level of absorption in ngc1275 is too high for any soft excess to be observed ) .",
    "they may form in dense star clusters .",
    "our optical studies have clearly shown that the ulx have very high x - ray to optical flux ratios .",
    "x - ray selected agn from the _",
    "rosat all sky survey _ tend to have @xmath20 .",
    "thus the ulx do not have the optical properties expected if their were simple extensions of agn ( imbh , as low luminosity limit ) .",
    "however , low mass x - ray binaries in the milky way have @xmath21 ( mushotzky 2004 ) .",
    "the results found in our system indicate that we have a mixed group of objects ( see table [ tab : optical ] ) . at least 4 out of 8 sources ( n3 , n4 , n5 and n8 ) have high x - ray to optical flux ratios .",
    "at least 3 out of 8 ( n1 , n2 and n6 ) have lower x - ray to optical ratios , possibly because they lie in star clusters .",
    "our data are consistent with no significant variability , similar to the result obtained on ngc3256 by lira et al .",
    "time variability is frequently observed in ulx ( e.g. ic342 , sugiho et al .",
    "2001 or m51 x-1 , liu et al .",
    "2002 ) , arguing that most of them are single compact objects , rather than a sum of numerous lower luminosity objects in the same object .",
    "while most ulx vary , many show low amplitude variability on long time scales ( e.g. the antennae galaxies , zezas et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is very different to galactic black holes .",
    "portegies zwart , dewi & maccarone ( 2004 ) find that a persistent bright ulx requires a doner star exceeding @xmath22 .",
    "the search for characteristic frequencies is one of the most productive way of determining the nature of the ulx .",
    "we have described the detailed analysis of the spatial and spectral properties of the discrete x - ray sources detected with a deep _ chandra _ acis - s observation around ngc1275 .",
    "our results are summarized below :    1 .",
    "we have detected a total of 8 sources to the north of ngc1275 nucleus .",
    "the sources are spatially coincident with the high velocity system and thus probably associated with it .",
    "they are therefore ulx .",
    "four of the sources have an optical counterpart in the i and r bands ( from _ hst _ images ) ; two of which are point - like sources and the other two are associated with star - forming regions .",
    "4 .   in all the cases",
    "a single component power law gives satisfactory fits , with spectral index of @xmath23[1.78 - 3.51 ] and an equivalent column density of @xmath24\\times      10^{21}cm^{-2}}$ ] .",
    "the minimum luminosity is @xmath25 ( source n1 ) , which is already above the limit of canonical ulx .",
    "no variability was detected in the two brightest sources found .",
    "our results add to the growing evidence that some episodes of rapid star formation lead to the production of ulx .",
    "young , massive , star clusters may be involved in some , but not all of the sources .",
