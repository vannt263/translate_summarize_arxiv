    "estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are important for understanding the physics of accretion flows because many aspects of accretion physics at fixed radius scale with @xmath1 and accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the eddington ratio is related to the accretion rate .",
    "estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are important for understanding the growth of supermassive black holes because the mass distribution directly probes the buildup of the black hole population , while the eddington ratio distribution is related to the instantaneous growth rate of the black hole population .",

    "it is well accepted that currently the most reliable method for estimating @xmath1 is through modeling the spatially resolved stellar and gas dynamics in the host galaxy s nucleus . however , for most agn this is not feasible , both due to the presence of the active nucleus and due to the strong requirements on the angular resolution of the nucleus .",

    ", masses derived from reverberation mapping are only good to within a multiplicative scaling factor that varies for each agn and depends on the geometry of the broad line region , the importance of radiation pressure , and other potential sources for systematic error ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", scaling relationships are used to obtain mass estimates for large numbers of agn over a broad range in redshift and luminosity .",
    "such scaling relationships are based on correlations between @xmath1 and some feature , or set of features , that are easier to measure .",
    "the scaling relationships are calibrated to masses derived from either stellar and gas dynamical modeling or from reverberation mapping .",
    "the scatter in the masses derived from the scaling relationships at fixed @xmath1 defines the statistical error in the mass estimates with respect to the masses derived from dynamical modeling or reverberation mapping .    the most common scaling relationships used to estimate @xmath1 are those based on the host galaxy properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or x - ray variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also occasionally used . by far the most common scaling relationship used to estimate @xmath1 in agn",
    "is the one involving the broad emission lines .",
    "broad line mass estimates have been used in studies of agn accretion physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the various scaling relationships for estimating @xmath1 have their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "moreover , there is considerable potential for systematic error in these scaling relationships , and employing mass estimates derived from more than one scaling relationship is important for assessing the impact of unknown systematics on the scientific conclusions .",
    "the broad line mass estimates can only be obtained for type 1 agn , and thus are not applicable to agn that are either obscured or diluted by their host galaxy . moreover",
    ", several studies have indicated that the statistical scatter in these mass estimates for agn in a narrow luminosity range is smaller than the @xmath5 dex scatter seen about the reverberation mapping masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may be indicative of a bias in these mass estimates as a function of luminosity @xcite , at least when the line width is estimated using the fwhm . and finally , the broad line mass estimates are usually calculated based on the h@xmath6 , mgii , or civ  emission lines .",
    "the mass estimates based on h@xmath6  are considered the most secure , primarily due to the fact that most of the reverberation mapping analysis is based on h@xmath6 , but there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the systematics of the mgii  and civ  lines .",
    "there is almost no reverberation mapping data involving the mgii  line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the civ  line is often considered the most problematic , as it is thought to arise from the base of a wind launched from the accretion disk , and thus may have a significant non - virial component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , while the fwhm for h@xmath6  and mgii  correlate , the fwhm between mgii  and civ  exhibit only a weak correlation ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) likely due to the presence of a non - variable component in the emission line @xcite .",
    "however , the mass estimates do correlate for h@xmath6  and civ  when one uses the second moment of the civ  line obtained from high @xmath7 spectra @xcite . and",
    "finally , the agn studied via reverberation mapping occupy a narrower range of parameter space with respect to their emission line properties than does the general population @xcite , and it is unclear if systematic errors become significant when extrapolating beyond this region of parameter space .",
    "in contrast to the broad line mass estimates , mass estimates derived from the host galaxy properties can be obtained for agn that are obscured or diluted by their host .",
    "however , the host galaxy properties are difficult to impossible to measure for bright agn , and the broad line mass estimates must be used in this case . moreover",
    ", much recent work has shown that the host galaxy scaling relationships are more complicated than originally thought , and depend on the host galaxy morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there is considerable uncertainty regarding the form of these scaling relationships beyond the local universe . while many studies have found evidence that the normalization in the scaling relationships evolves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite for cautionary notes ) , there is still considerable uncertainty in whether the slope or scatter also evolve . indeed ,",
    "many models connecting the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies predict evolution in the scaling relationships ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray variability provides a third scaling method for estimating @xmath1 that is competitive with the broad emission line and host galaxy techniques , and can overcome some of their respective disadvantages .",
    "in fact , recent work has suggested that scaling relationships involving x - ray variability provide mass estimates with @xmath8 dex precision ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is comparable to mass estimates derived from the @xmath1@xmath3 relationship for ellipticals @xcite and better than mass estimates derived from the broad emission lines ( @xmath5 dex , * ? ? ?",
    "even before reliable @xmath1 estimates were available it was suggested that x - ray variability properties should scale with @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent work has also found trends between the optical variability properties of agn and @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they are not as well established as the x - ray trends .",
    "however , the investigation of such trends will provide an important foundation for interpreting and utilizing the variability information from current and planned time - domain optical surveys , such as those obtained by pan - starrs and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "the origin of the x - ray variability scaling relationship is a dependence of the x - ray power spectral density ( psd ) on black hole mass .",
    "the x - ray psds of both galactic black holes and supermassive black holes are similar within the uncertainty caused by the poorer data quality of agn lightcurves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially for galactic black holes in the ` high - soft ' state .",
    "agn x - ray psds are typically well - modeled by a bending power law form , @xmath9 , where the psd slope is @xmath10 down to some high - frequency break @xmath11 , and then steepens to @xmath12 at frequencies @xmath13 .",
    "many authors have found a significant anti - correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which extends all the way down to galactic black holes . the time scale corresponding to the break frequency scales with @xmath1 and luminosity approximately as @xmath14 @xcite , which implies @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the accretion rate relative to eddington . in principle",
    "the x - ray variability time scale can be used to estimated @xmath1 , but in practice it is hard to measure , requiring a lightcurve that is well sampled on time scales near @xmath17 .",
    "a related scaling relationship between the amplitude of the psd at frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath1 shows considerable promise as a mass estimator @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the high - frequency psd can be measured by fitting a power - law to the periodogram ( i.e. , the empirical power spectrum ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by fitting a stochastic process to the measured lightcurve @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is common to use the excess variance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a probe of the high - frequency psd .",
    "the excess variance is the fractional variance in a x - ray lightcurve after subtracting off the variance due to the poisson noise from counting photons .",
    "it is related to the amplitude of the high - frequency psd because it is the integral of the psd over the time scales probed by a lightcurve .",
    "several groups have found a significant anti - correlation between the excess variance and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "results obtained from fitting the normalization of the high - frequency psd and the excess variance imply that these scaling relationships can be used to derive mass estimates with @xmath18@xmath19 dex precision relative to the mass estimates obtained from reverberation mapping or through dynamical modeling @xcite .",
    "because the mass estimates derived from reverberation mapping themselves are uncertain , it is possible that the true scatter in the high - frequency x - ray variability relative to @xmath1 may be even smaller .",
    "moreover , motivated by upcoming massive time - domain optical surveys , such as those performed by lsst , it is worth investigating if similar trends with @xmath1 hold for the optical variability as well ; the existence of such trends could potentially enable black hole mass estimates for millions of quasars .    while there is significant potential in high - frequency x - ray variability as a mass estimator , in practice it can be difficult to measure .",
    "the periodogram is distorted by the finite , and possibly irregular , sampling of the lightcurve .",
    "this can cause biases in the derived high - frequency normalization when fitting the empirical psd , and monte carlo techniques are required to correct for this @xcite .",
    "the excess variance , while easy to measure , is also problematic . in order for the excess variance to be proportional to the normalization of the high - frequency psd ,",
    "the length of the lightcurve must not be significantly longer than the break time scale , @xmath17 , or must be broken up into smaller segments .",
    "if the break frequency is not known , there is no guarantee that this requirement is satisfied .",
    "the fact that the break frequency increases with decreasing @xmath1 further complicates this issue .",
    "moreover , because the expected value of the excess variance is the integral of the psd over the time scales probes by the lightcurve , it will depend on the length and sampling of the lightcurve , and thus must be normalized to some fiducial lightcurve length ; failure to correct for the effects of sampling can lead to biases in the inferred excess variance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these issues regarding sampling the psd above the break frequency are illustrated in figure [ f - illust_psd ] . and finally , the excess variance is a noisy estimate , exhibiting large changes when measured in non - overlapping intervals from a stochastic lightcurve @xcite .",
    "monte carlo methods need to be used to assess the bias and uncertainty in the excess variance estimates .",
    "these issues can inhibit the widespread use of the x - ray variability as a black hole mass estimator .    .",
    "the variance of a lightcurve is given by the integral of the psd over the frequencies corresponding to the time scales probed by the lightcurve .",
    "when the lightcurve is probing time scales corresponding to frequencies above the break , then the variance is correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "however , when the lightcurve is probing time scales below the break , the correlation with @xmath1 weakens . because the break frequency is in general unknown , this can cause problems when using the lightcurve variance as a @xmath1 estimator . in this work",
    "we describe a statistical technique to always measure the psd amplitude above the break frequency , which can then be used to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "[ f - illust_psd ] ]    the techniques developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kbs09 and kss11 , respectively ) that derive the high - frequency psd by fitting a stochastic process to the lightcurve do not suffer from these distortions caused by the sampling pattern .",
    "moreover , kbs09 and kss11 derive the likelihood function for the psd parameters , including the break frequency @xmath11 and the normalization of the psd at @xmath13 , under the assumption that the high frequency psd falls off as @xmath20 .",
    "thus in these models the amplitude of high - frequency variability is a parameter which can be estimated via maximum - likelihood or bayesian methods , providing an optimal use of the information in the data and rigorous uncertainties on the parameters .",
    "this is an advantage over the excess variance or empirical psd techniques , as it provides more precision in the mass estimates than does the excess variance , and it does not require expensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "essentially all methods that have been used to estimate the high - frequency psd have assumed that the measurement errors on the background - subtracted lightcurve are normally distributed .",
    "however , this assumption becomes inaccurate for faint x - ray sources , in which case it may be necessary to use large time bins to ensure approximate gaussian statistics , thus reducing the amount of variability information .",
    "in addition , this assumption becomes inaccurate when the background count rate becomes comparable to the source count rate . in order to enable x - ray variability - based mass estimates for large numbers of agn",
    "it is necessary to develop statistical techniques that can be applied directly to the x - ray counts .",
    "motivated by these issues , we have set out in this paper to first develop a method for estimating the normalization of the high - frequency psd that works directly on a time series of x - ray counts without employing gaussian approximations , thus providing tools to obtain x - ray variability based @xmath1 estimates in practice . after doing this",
    ", we seek to derive scaling relationships between the amplitude of high - frequency x - ray variability and @xmath1 using 34 agn with @xmath1 estimated from reverberation mapping or dynamical modeling ; this is the largest sample yet of its kind used for investigating this scaling relationship .",
    "these scaling relationships not only provide the calibration needed to use the amplitude of high - frequency x - ray variability as a mass estimator , but also provide valuable empirical constraints on the physics of the accretion flows . and finally , using this same set of agn we investigate whether the optical variability also shows significant trends with @xmath1 that might enable it to be used as a mass estimator , as well as provide empirical constraints on the physics of the accretion flows .",
    "our sample consists of those agn that have black hole masses estimated from reverberation mapping or dynamical modeling .",
    "all values of @xmath1 derived from reverberation mapping were recalculated from the virial factors assuming a value of @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath22 is the proportionality constant between @xmath1 and the virial factor . using this data set as a starting point , we searched the literature for archival x - ray and optical lightcurves .",
    "in addition , we obtained a new x - ray lightcurve for pg 1426 + 015 from swift .",
    "our sample is summarized in table [ t - sample ] .",

    "the role of the driving noise is to introduce stochasticity into the lightcurve , which persistently and randomly ` kicks ' the lightcurve about its mean value .",

    "a flat psd is indicative of a white noise process , implying that @xmath55 represents the time scale beyond which the variations in the lightcurve become uncorrelated .",
    "hence , under the ou process model @xmath55 may be interpreted as the `` relaxation '' , or `` characteristic '' time scale of the lightcurve , and marks the location of the knee in the psd .",

    "then the likelihood function for the measured lightcurve is given by kbs09 for the ou process model and by kss11 for the sup - ou process model ; we refer the reader to those papers for further details .",

    "* ) , and this is the approach employed in this work .",
    "the posterior probability distribution of the count rates and the variability parameters , given the measured counts , is proportional to equation ( [ eq - complete_lik ] ) .",

    "we fix the value of @xmath125 to be equal to one , a typical value for agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we fix the value of @xmath85 to be the smaller of the inverse of ten times the length of the lightcurve or @xmath132 .",
    "these values were chosen to correspond to sufficiently long time scales that we would not observe the low - frequency break in any of our lightcurves .",
    "we model the background count rates , @xmath133 as being generated by an ou process .",
    "this is probably not exactly true in practice , but the point of this model is to provide estimates of the background count rates which are smoothed versions of the measured counts in each bin .",

    "this assumption is based on the fact that the scaling relationship between luminosity and broad line region size is driven by photoionization physics , and should not change with redshift unless certain characteristics of the broad line region change with redshift .",

    "in addition , it is not necessary to calibrate different scaling relationships , as needed for the broad emission lines . and",
    "finally , perhaps the strongest advantage is that the x - ray rsvp is a simple and clean quantity to estimate , and does not require separating out the feature of interest through a decomposition , as is necessary to measure the properties of a host galaxy bulge or an emission line width .    it may appear that it is not possible to obtain @xmath1 estimates from @xmath169 for faint agn or those with only a few epochs in their lightcurve , as the @xmath141 part of the psd may never appear above the poisson noise level .",

    "the optical emission is emitted much further out than the x - ray emission ; recent microlensing investigations imply that the optical radiation is generated at @xmath4@xmath153 gravitational radii , while the x - rays are generated from within several gravitational radii @xcite .",
    "in addition , the optical emission is thought to be thermal radiation from an optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk , while the x - ray emission comes from an optically thin corona of hot electrons . as seen in figure [ f - rsvp_compare ]",
    "the amplitude of optical rsvp ( corresponding to time scales of @xmath129 days ) is uncorrelated with the x - ray rsvp ( corresponding to time scales of @xmath31 seconds ) .",
    "this suggests that the optical variability on time scales of @xmath129 days is not primarily driven by reprocessing of x - ray emission , but instead is likely driven by processes in the disk local to where it is emitted .",
    "the optical rsvp is more tightly correlated with luminosity than either @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "standard thin accretion disk models assume that the disk is optically thick in the height - direction , implying that the disk should roughly radiate locally as a blackbody .",
    "if the accretion disk radiates as a blackbody at a radius @xmath229 , then the disk temperature at @xmath229 can be derived by equating the dissipation rate per unit face area of the disk to the blackbody flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath230 here , @xmath231 is the accretion rate . under these assumptions ,",
    "most of the emission at a characteristic wavelength @xmath107 is coming from a radius @xmath232 noting that the disk orbital time scale is @xmath233 and assuming @xmath234 , we find @xmath235 because many other physically relevant time scales are proportional to @xmath236 , the @xmath237 scaling holds for a variety of time scales . in particular , for an @xmath125-disk @xcite , the disk thermal time scale is @xmath238 where @xmath125 is the standard viscosity parameter .",
    "similar to the x - ray rsvp interpretation , if we assume that the fractional optical variability per disk orbital time scale is constant , then equation ( [ eq - torb_lum ] ) implies that @xmath239 when the optical rsvp is expressed in units of fractional variability per second .",
    "this scaling is in excellent agreement with what we find empirically in equation ( [ eq - opt_rsvp_lbol ] ) .",
    "therefore , our empirical trend between the optical rsvp and luminosity is consistent with an interpretation where the disk emits locally as roughly a blackbody , and the fractional variability emitted per disk orbital or thermal time scale is constant . within this interpretation",
    ", the additional scatter in @xmath159 could be caused by variations in the location and size of the region emitting optical radiation at a characteristic wavelength @xmath107 , and by variations in the viscosity @xmath125 .",
    "part of the residual scatter may also be caused by deviations in the high - frequency psd logarithmic slope from our assumed value of @xmath240 .",
    "in this work we investigated correlations involving the amplitude of short time scale agn optical and x - ray variability and black hole mass , luminosity , and eddington ratio . in summary",
    ":    * we presented a new swift lightcurve for pg 1426 + 015 , the agn with the highest estimated black hole mass obtained from either reverberation mapping or dynamical modeling , sampling time scales @xmath241 days to @xmath242 days .",
    "* we presented a new bayesian statistical technique for measuring variability parameters directly from a lightcurve of photon counts for arbitrary sampling .",
    "the technique is based on the likelihood function of the measured lightcurve , and thus efficiently uses all of the information in the data .",
    "this technique will be useful for measuring variability parameters for faint sources as the x - ray count rates do not need to be binned to obtain gaussian statistics in the lightcurve ; such measurements will enable x - ray variability based black hole mass estimates for agn over a broader range of luminosities and redshifts . *",
    "we analyzed both x - ray and optical archival lightcurves for a sample of 39 agn , measuring the normalization of the high - frequency part of their psds .",
    "* we find that the normalization of the high - frequency x - ray psd is tightly anti - correlated with @xmath1 , with no residual trend with eddington ratio .",
    "this anti - correlation is consistent with previous work that has found that the x - ray excess variance is inversely proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that this @xmath162@xmath1 scaling relationship can be used to obtain @xmath1 estimates from the high - frequency x - ray variability with @xmath243 dex precision relative to the literature values of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath162@xmath1 trend implies that the high - frequency fractional x - ray variability per disk dynamical time scale is independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "* we find that the amplitude of optical variability on time scales @xmath129 days is anti - correlated with @xmath244 and @xmath245 , with the tightest trend being with luminosity .",
    "we quantified the trends with @xmath1 and @xmath245 as @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "we find that estimates of @xmath1 based on the optical variability scaling relationship would have a precision of @xmath200 dex relative to the literature values of @xmath1 .",
    "while this is not as precise as other scaling relationship , it still may provide reasonable estimates of @xmath1 demographics for large samples of agn .",
    "in addition , the optical variability scaling relationship exhibits an additional trend with luminosity at fixed mass , and therefore it may be possible to obtain @xmath1 estimates with better precision as a function of both @xmath159 and @xmath245 ; future work using an unbiased sample of agn is needed to investigate this .",
    "the optical variability trends found here will provide an important foundation for interpreting agn optical variability in the era of pan - starrs and lsst .",
