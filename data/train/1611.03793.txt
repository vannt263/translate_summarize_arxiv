    "despite the success of the collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario in the description of the process of structure formation @xcite , still important difficulties are present regarding the predictions of simulations on sub - galactic scales . indeed , dark matter ( dm ) only n - body simulations predict cuspy profiles for the dm halo densities whereas observations of dm dominated objects , such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies , suggest more cored distributions ( cusp - core problem ) @xcite . also , this kind of simulations predicts more satellite galaxies for milky way type objects than actually observed ( missing satellite problem ) @xcite .",
    "finally the central densities of the most massive simulated subhalos are much higher than those observed in the most luminous satellite galaxies ( too big to fail problem ) @xcite",
    ".    possible solutions to such problems have been suggested in recent years .",
    "in particular the inclusion of different baryonic physics effects in the simulations , such as feedback from supernova explosions and stellar wind or cosmic ray heating have been proposed among others @xcite . however , there are other proposals which are based on the modification of the cdm scenario itself .",
    "thus the interest in warm dm @xcite , self - interacting @xcite or decaying @xcite dm models which typically generate a small scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum has grown in recent years .",
    "another proposal along these lines is the so called wave dm model @xcite which has been also known as fuzzy dm , i.e. scalar field dm made of ultralight bosons with negligible selfinteractions .",
    "the most popular candidates being the axion - like particles ( alps ) with very small masses typically arising in string theory @xcite . in these wave dm scenarios , it is the uncertainty principle what prevents the formation of structures on small scales . indeed ,",
    "if dm is made of very light particles with masses @xmath5 ev , the corresponding number density is so high that the interparticle separation becomes smaller than the compton wavelength so that a field description of dm would be possible ( bose - einstein condensate ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", at the background level , i.e. without perturbations , for massive scalars this field description can be seen as that of a coherently oscillating classical field whose average energy density precisely scales as cdm @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effect on perturbations of the very light fields can also be understood easily if we take into account that for masses below @xmath6 ev , the de broglie wavelength of a slowly moving dm particle is of astrophysical size .",
    "more concretely the comoving de broglie wavelength is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this means that since it is not possible to localize the dm particle on scales smaller than @xmath8 , structure formation is suppressed on those small scales @xcite .",
    "thus , in this kind of models , we have two different regimes for perturbations . on scales larger than @xmath8 ,",
    "the usual particle - like behaviour is a good description and the standard cdm behaviour is recovered , whereas on smaller scales we have a wave - like behaviour which suppresses structure formation .",
    "the wave dm scenario has been considered so far for scalar fields .",
    "thus the general analysis of the behaviour of these scalar field models at the background level was developed in @xcite and the study of its perturbations can be found in @xcite for massive scalars and @xcite for a generic power - law potential .",
    "however , in principle , the scenario could be also implemented for any bosonic field .",
    "the main problem which arises in the case of vectors or higher spin fields is that coherent homogeneous fields typically break isotropy .",
    "however it has been recently shown ( see @xcite for abelian vector fields , @xcite for non - abelian theories and @xcite for arbitrary spin ) that for rapidly oscillating coherent fields , even though the field evolution is generically anisotropic , the average energy - momentum tensor is not .",
    "in particular , for massive fields it is straightforward to show that the average energy density scales as @xmath9 .",
    "this opens the possibility of extending the wave dm scenario to higher spin fields .    in this work",
    ", we will consider the case of massive abelian vector fields .",
    "the interest in homogeneous vector fields as cosmological fluids has been growing in the last years , see @xcite for dark energy examples and @xcite for inflation models based on vector fields .",
    "the possibility that a condensate of very light vector particles could play the role of dm was explored in @xcite and a wide phenomenological study of this model was made in @xcite .",
    "such a condensate could be produced during inflation and its small mass could be generated by the stuckelberg mechanism .",
    "a small kinetic mixing with the photon could make this dark photon detectable @xcite .    here ,",
    "in particular , we will concentrate in the dynamics of cosmological perturbations in such vector dm models .",
    "the main difficulty compared to the scalar case is the presence of a non - vanishing vector field already at the background level .",
    "this implies that the usual decoupling of the evolution of scalar , vector and tensor perturbations at the linear level no longer holds in this case .",
    "however , this fact provides a potential way of discriminating vector models from scalar ones .",
    "in particular , we will show that although in the particle regime with @xmath0 the model is indistinguishable from cdm , in the wave regime @xmath1 the scalar and vector modes are coupled to the tensors .",
    "this implies that unlike scalar field models , density perturbations generate a specific gravity wave spectrum together with a non - vanishing anisotropic stress .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , in section ii , we will review the time averaging procedure in cosmology . then , in section iii , we will consider the anisotropy problem for homogeneous vector fields . in section",
    "iv we obtain the basic equations for perturbations of massive vectors and in section v we write them for scalar and vector modes .",
    "sections vi and vii are devoted to the results for scalar and vector perturbations where the adiabatic solutions of the perturbations equations are obtained in the different regimes . in section viii",
    "we concentrate on the generation of gravity waves and section ix in the possibility of detection .",
    "finally section x includes the main conclusions of the work .",
    "many of the results we will obtain in this work are based on the assumption that in the presence of rapidly oscillating fields , it is possible to time average the energy - momentum tensor so that the resulting solutions of einstein equation are a good approximation to the exact ones . in order to determine when",
    "this is the case , we will consider a simple example , which will help us to understand the key aspects of this procedure .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous scalar field oscillating in a power - law potential @xmath10 with @xmath11 and even integer .",
    "in a flat flrw metric in proper time , @xmath12 the equation of motion can be written as @xmath13 where the dot represents the @xmath14 derivative .",
    "making the change @xmath15 and @xmath16 , ( [ eom2 ] ) reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the derivative with respect to the new time variable @xmath19 .",
    "let us assume that the frequency of the oscillations @xmath20 is large compared to the rate of expansion of the universe i.e. @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "thus we can define the small parameter @xmath23 .",
    "accordingly , the terms proportional to @xmath24 in ( [ eqtilde ] ) will be suppressed by @xmath25 compared to the other ones and we can write @xmath26 thus , the solution can be written in terms of the field @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a slowly evolving fuction of @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a periodic fast oscillating function with period @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "let us now try to obtain the scale factor @xmath35 from einstein equations .",
    "the system formed by the friedmann and conservation equations read @xmath36 from which we can obtain , @xmath37 so that integrating twice in time we get : @xmath38 the @xmath39 terms in the integrand are dominated by the derivatives of the rapidly oscillating function so that we can approximate @xmath40 since @xmath41 is also a periodic function we can fourier expand it as : @xmath42 let us now perform the first time integration @xmath43 with @xmath44 . integrating by parts the @xmath45 terms",
    "we get , @xmath46^{\\tilde\\eta_1}_{\\tilde\\eta_0 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\left[\\frac{c_m\\partial_{\\tilde\\eta_2}{\\tilde   f^2}(\\tilde\\eta_2)}{m^2\\omega^2}\\cos(m\\omega\\tilde\\eta_2)\\right]^{\\tilde\\eta_1}_{\\tilde\\eta_0 } + \\dots = i_0+\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty i_m\\label{pint}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that @xmath47 is proportional to the first derivative of @xmath48 which in general is expected to be , @xmath49 thus we see that compared to the @xmath48 term , the amplitude of the oscillating @xmath50 contributions are generically suppressed by : @xmath51 moreover , the second integration in ( [ aexact ] ) , reduces in another @xmath52 factor the oscillatory contributions .",
    "notice also that the periodic factor of the @xmath53 correction term in ( [ phip ] ) can be expressed as a total time derivative , @xmath54 , which does not contribute to the zero mode of the fourier expansion , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , in general , we can expand the scale factor as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the contribution from the @xmath55 term whereas @xmath58 are the oscillatory contributions .",
    "we can conclude that , up to @xmath59 , it is a good approximation to neglect the oscillatory terms @xmath60 in the source of einstein equations provided the solution involves two time integrations .",
    "thus we will denote by @xmath61 the operation of extracting the @xmath62 mode of the fourier expansion , i.e. : @xmath63 notice that this operation is equivalent to time averaging @xmath64 up to @xmath52 terms .",
    "indeed @xmath65 where in the last step we have considered that both uncertainties are of the same order . consequently , in general if we consider the average einstein equations @xmath66 the corresponding solutions for @xmath67 would differ from the exact ones in @xmath59 terms .",
    "let us consider a massive abelian vector field in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "the corresponding action reads @xmath68 with @xmath69 the equations of motion are given by : @xmath70 we will first consider the dynamics of the homogeneous background fields . for simplicity we will work with linearly polarized fields @xmath71 assuming that the energy - momentum tensor is dominated by the vector field , the background geometry can be represented through a bianchi i metric , @xmath72 the @xmath73 component of the equation of motion reads @xmath74 so that the temporal component identically vanish , whereas the @xmath75 equations imply @xmath76 where dot represents derivative respect to the conformal time @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , from the exact einstein equations @xmath78 we get @xmath79    let us now assume that the field @xmath80 is oscillating rapidly around the minimum of the potential , i.e. we will consider that @xmath81 , with @xmath82 the comoving hubble parameter and @xmath83 , then the equation of motion ( [ azeq ] ) can be solved in the wkb approximation as , @xmath84 with @xmath85 . introducing this solution in the system and averaging ( extracting the zero mode as discussed in the previous section ) ,",
    "the average einstein equations @xmath86 read @xmath87 the second equation shows that there is no source for anisotropy in the average equations , so that @xmath88 thus , if the initial conditions are isotropic then @xmath89 at all times and the third equation reads @xmath90 with solution to leading order in @xmath91 @xmath92 thus , as shown in @xcite the average geometry generated by a rapidly oscillating massive abelian vector field is isotropic and evolves as in a matter dominated universe . if the vector field is responsible for all the dm contribution , its amplitude will be given by @xmath93 with @xmath94 the cdm density parameter and @xmath95 the critical density .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that despite the anisotropic evolution of the background vector field , the average geometry can be described by an isotropic flrw metric .",
    "thus , we will consider the most general form of the perturbations around the robertson - walker geometry @xmath96\\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ a_{\\mu } & = & \\left ( \\delta a_0(\\eta,\\vec{x } ) , \\ ; \\vec{a}(\\eta ) + \\delta \\vec{a}(\\eta,\\vec{x } ) \\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a solenoidal vector field and @xmath98 a symmetric traceless transverse tensor .    from ( [ fieldeq ] ) , fourier transforming the spatial dependence ,",

    "this means that the standard separation in the evolution can be more involved in this case . in this work",
    "we will proceed as follows : we will first consider the dynamics of scalar and vector modes neglecting the contributions from gravity waves .",
    "we will then analyze the generation of gravity waves and will find that they are generically suppressed compared to the scalar and vector modes , thus proving that our initial assumption was correct .",
    "from equations ( [ ec00]-[ec0i ] ) setting @xmath106 we can obtain the following set of equations , which together with the equation of motion ( [ eqdeltaai ] ) will be the starting point of our analysis :    * from the combination @xmath107 we get , @xmath108 with @xmath109 the unitary vector in the wavenumber direction . * from @xmath110",
    "we obtain @xmath111 * from the longitudinal part of @xmath112 we get @xmath113 * from the solenoidal part of @xmath112 we can write @xmath114    before analysing the modes in the different regimes , we would like to make the following preliminary considerations :    1 .   for simplicity we will consider a linearly polarized background field , which can be written without loss of generality as @xmath115 with @xmath116 a slowly varying amplitude .",
    "+ we will work in the matter dominated era , assuming that all the dm is generated by the vector field and ignoring for simplicity the small baryon contribution .",
    "thus , from the friedmann equation , @xmath117 with @xmath118 the average energy density : @xmath119 we get @xmath120 2 .",
    "as we are dealing with vector equations , it is very helpful to adopt the orthonormal basis @xmath121 , for modes with @xmath122 ; where @xmath123 is the normalized vector in @xmath124 direction and @xmath125 . on the other hand , in the degenerate case with @xmath126 , we can use a new orthonormal basis @xmath127 , where @xmath128 span the orthogonal plane to @xmath129 .",
    "it can be seen that the perturbations in those directions are purely vector with the same dynamics as the @xmath130 , whereas the @xmath129 components generate purely scalar modes also with the same behaviour as in the non - parallel case .",
    "finally , no tensor modes are sourced for @xmath126 .",
    "3 .   the @xmath129 component of ( [ eq0ivec ] ) gives us an algebraic equation for @xmath131 .",
    "once it is solved , it is straightforward to write the other two components of @xmath132 as a function of the scalar perturbations of the metric and the vector field .",
    "after that , combining equations ( [ slipeq ] ) , ( [ eq00 ] ) and ( [ eq0isca ] ) , we reach an algebraic system from which we obtain @xmath133 and @xmath134 depending on @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "we have three independent ( comoving ) scales in the problem , namely , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the main assumption of this work is that @xmath140 , so that we can define two small parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "depending on the relation between these two ratios , the evolution of the perturbations will behave differently .",
    "thus , as we will show , the case @xmath143 , i.e. @xmath144 will lead to the standard cdm behaviour , whereas the @xmath145 case , i.e. @xmath146 will correspond to the wave dm behaviour as commented above .",
    "we will perform an expansion in @xmath91 and obtain only the leading order term .",
    "the sub - leading correction will in general receive contributions from the oscillating terms ( @xmath45 ) mentioned in section ii and are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "5 .   provided @xmath147 , as mentioned before , we will take for the perturbations an adiabatic ansatz similar to that of the background : @xmath148 with @xmath149 slowly evolving amplitudes .",
    "on the other hand , in the regime with @xmath150 , the perturbed field oscillates with a different frequency and as a result in the averaging procedure all the perturbed quantities vanish , consequently a cut off in perturbations is expected in the high wavenumber region .",
    "in the very - low wavenumber regime with @xmath151 i.e. @xmath152 the leading order equations get contributions from the oscillating terms that can not be neglected .",
    "thus , our perturbative approach does not allow to explore this region .",
    "fortunately , for the masses usually considered @xcite this range is out of the cosmologically observable band .    in fig.[scales ]",
    "we show the evolution of the different comoving scales involved in the adiabatic expansion , namely , @xmath153 , @xmath138 , @xmath154 and @xmath137 as a function of @xmath155 from matter - radiation equality to the present time .",
    "we see that modes in the wave regime can cross into the particle regime , but this is not possible in the opposite way .",
    "as mentioned above , we will concentrate in two different regimes , namely , @xmath143 and @xmath156 .",
    "we will present the results of the perturbative analysis to the leading order in the adiabatic expansion , i.e. up to relative corrections of order @xmath91 .      solving the set of equations ( [ eqdeltaai ] ) , ( [ slipeq ] ) , ( [ eq00 ] ) , ( [ eq0isca ] ) , ( [ eq0ivec ] )",
    ", we get for the amplitude vectors @xmath157 and @xmath158 the following solutions in components to leading order .    for the components orthogonal to the background vector @xmath159",
    "the solution is straightforward , @xmath160 with @xmath161 constants .",
    "these components do not contribute to the scalar perturbations @xmath134 and @xmath133 nor to the density and pressure perturbations .",
    "the equations for the @xmath162 component read : @xmath163 solving we obtain , @xmath164 the behaviour is the same as that of standard cdm .",
    "notice that the non - decaying mode of the scalar perturbation @xmath134 is constant independently of the mode and the gravitational slip vanishes since @xmath165 .",
    "moreover , the perturbed energy density is controlled by @xmath166 , making the density contrast @xmath167 constant for super - hubble modes and growing as @xmath168 for sub - hubble modes as expected .",
    "this case corresponds to modes whose wavelength is comparable to the de broglie wavelength of a comoving dm particle . in this regime the wave properties of dm could have important effects .    as in the previous case , we study the evolution of the different components . for",

    "ultralight bosonic fields are natural dm candidates which can avoid some of the small - scale problems of the standard cdm model .",
    "most of the work developed so far in this field has focused on the simplest implementation of this scenario based on scalar fields . in this work",
    "we have considered the case of ultralight vector fields .",
    "the first difficulty in the higher spin case already appears at the background level , since such fields generically break isotropy .",
    "fortunately , a general result @xcite shows that for massive fields without self interactions and masses much larger than the expansion rate , the average energy - momentum tensor is isotropic and behaves as cdm .    at the perturbation level ,",
    "we have considered an adiabatic expansion in two different regimes , the so called particle regime with @xmath143 and the wave regime with @xmath145 . very much as in the scalar case",
    ", we find that for vectors , the particle regime is indistinguishable from cdm .",
    "however , in the wave regime important differences with respect to the scalar case arise .",
    "thus , perturbations in the vector field support three kinds of metric perturbations . on one hand , we have two scalar modes with a small but non - vanishing sound speed @xmath248 which suppresses structure formation for @xmath249 .",
    "such modes generate a non - vanishing gravitation slip of order @xmath250 which is a specific feature of this ultralight vector field dm model .",
    "in addition , the scalar modes source tensor modes with a small amplitude @xmath251 and a characteristic spectrum which peaks around @xmath252 .",
    "the amplitude of this gravity wave spectrum is however below the sensitivity of present and future detectors .",
    "nevertheless , the calculation done in this work has been conservative in the sense that we have focused only in the potential generation of gravity waves in the matter dominated era .",
    "a complete study would require to consider also perturbations in the radiation era .",
    "on the other hand , we have four vector modes which are also sources of gravity waves .",
    "the vector modes decay as @xmath192 , i.e. in a similar fashion as in standard cdm cosmologies , so that we expect a negligible amount of vector modes at late times also in this model . in fig.[summary ] a summary of the perturbations behaviour in the different regions of the spectrum is shown for massive vector and scalar models .",
