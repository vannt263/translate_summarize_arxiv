    "in recent years , a great amount of work has been done exploring the possibility of very small departures of lorentz invariance , the standard - model extension proposed by kosteleck and colladay@xcite furnishing a general background for such investigations .",
    "one of the interesting possibilities arising in such a context is the modification of the dispersion relations governing the propagation of particles in the vacuum , which could generate outstanding effects in astrophysical observations , for instance@xcite . for gravity theories ,",
    "the incorporation of lorentz violation is delicate , in particular when the violation is not spontaneous@xcite ; nevertheless , it is worthwhile to investigate how to introduce lorentz violation in gravity in such a way that simple physical effects can be studied .",
    "this is one of the objectives of our work .",
    "we consider the linearized gravity theory augmented by one lorentz violating term in the lagrangian and show that it leads to a modified dispersion relation for the propagation of gravitational waves in the vacuum .",
    "next , we discuss one possible mechanism for the generation of such a term , based on a deformation of the poisson algebra of the metric fluctuation and its canonical conjugated momenta@xcite .",
    "more details of this calculation , together with another method to generate the particular form of lorentz violation we consider here , are discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the starting point of our study is the inclusion of a lorentz - violating term @xmath0 , @xmath1 in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian in the weak field approximation , also known as the fierz - pauli lagrangian . here , @xmath2 is the metric fluctuation , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a parameter for the lorentz violation .",
    "the term @xmath0 breaks the gauge invariance of the model ( which is the linearized version of the original diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity ) . since there exists a preferred direction in spacetime ,",
    "the angular momentum is no longer conserved , however , the energy - momentum tensor is still conserved since the background ( minkowski ) spacetime is homogeneous . as for the bianchi identities , they are not satisfied , and this problem can be traced back to the general incompatibility between explicit lorentz violation and riemann - cartan geometry@xcite .    to study gravitational wave propagation ,",
    "we show that the equations of motion for the traceless transversal part of the metric fluctuation @xmath5 are gauge invariant and decouple from the other componentes of @xmath6 ; this happens if @xmath7 .",
    "if this condition holds , we end up with @xmath8 \\ , = \\ , 0 \\,.\\ ] ] here , we defined an antisymmetric symbol @xmath9 .",
    "the above - mentioned condition can be met if we choose @xmath10 , such that the only nonvanishing @xmath11 are @xmath12 , and consider a wave propagating in the @xmath13 direction . in this case , eq .",
    "can be solved by the ansatz @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and we end up with only two independent equations , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relations are given respectively by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "thus the dispersion relations are modified , exhibiting a kind of birefringence phenomenon for the two circular polarizations of the gravitational waves .",
    "one possibility for the induction of eq .   is based on the deformation of the poisson algebra of the canonical variables@xcite .",
    "the inspection of the constraint structure of the fierz - pauli action yields a set of primary constraints @xmath22 , and secondary ones @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which act as generators of the gauge symmetry .",
    "the proposed deformation consists of assuming the noncommutativity of the canonical conjugated momenta , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a symbol possessing symmetry @xmath27 .",
    "we then require that , within this modified algebra , the secondary constraints still generates the same gauge symmetries of the undeformed theory . to this end",
    ", we have to modify the secondary constraints as follows , @xmath28 this modification implies a modification of the hamiltonian of the model , and therefore of the lagrangian , which turns out to be @xmath29 \\,.\\ ] ] to verify whether this procedure can reproduce @xmath0 , we make an assumption on the form of the @xmath30 .",
    "the most appropriate choice seems to be @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the induced term in the classical action is @xmath33 this term is invariant under gauge transformations satisfying @xmath34 .",
    "this ( restricted ) gauge freedom can be used to fix @xmath35 and @xmath36 , thus obtaining the simple modification @xmath37 , which leads to the same modified dispersion relations we obtained before .",
    "even if this deformation does not reproduce exactly the term @xmath0 , it leads to a modified gravity theory with ( restricted ) gauge invariance , and with the same deformed dispersion relations .",
    "we notice that this is not the only lorentz - violating additive term which can be obtained with use of the deformation of the poisson algebra . as an example , if we assume @xmath38 , we find that the following gauge - invariant term is generated in the action , @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "one may compare this with the well - known gravitational chern - simons term @xcite , @xmath40 $ ] ; if the @xmath41 vector is chosen to be purely spacelike , and the axial gauge @xmath36 is imposed , the gravitational chern - simons term is reduced to @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , under the gauge conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , is almost equivalent to eq .  , up to the term with third time derivative .",
    "we have studied the consequences of a lorentz - violating term in the propagation of gravitational waves in the linearized gravitation theory , finding a modified dispersion relation with a kind of birefringence effect .",
    "we have also shown how to generate this term via an appropriate deformation of the canonical algebra of the model , generalizing some ideas that have been proposed in connection with noncommutative gauge theories before .",
