    "solids do not flow .",
    "this apparently tautological statement can be wrong in two ways .",
    "first , solidity is in general a timescale - dependent phenomenon .",
    "crystal or glasses , well known solids on most experimentally relevant timescales , do flow if one waits long enough ( see ref .",
    "for example ) .",
    "second , at very small temperatures , quantum solids may become superfluids as suggested theoretically in the early seventies @xcite .",
    "a striking property of this phase of matter is the non - classical rotational inertia : a supersolid placed at thermal equilibrium in a rotating container does not rotate , at least not completely , for small angular velocity @xmath0 . in particular , its angular momentum is reduced from its classical value @xmath1 by a fraction @xmath2 which is called superfluid fraction .",
    "the first promising experimental evidence of supersolidity was found only four years ago by kim and chan @xcite through measurements of a non - classical rotational momentum of inertia ( ncri ) in solid he@xmath3 at low temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the physical mechanism underlying the observed effect is still unclear .",
    "in particular , despite intense experimental activity , it has not been established that the observed ncri in solid he@xmath3 is accompanied by superflow ( see , however , the very recent work reported in ref .  ) .",
    "nonetheless , some agreement has been reached by now on few basic facts @xcite : theoretical works have revealed that equilibrium he@xmath3 crystals at zero temperature are commensurate and _ not _ supersolids @xcite , or at least have an extremely small superfluid fraction , much too small to account for experimental findings ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "experiments have shown that the supersolid critical temperature and the superfluid density depend sensitively on the detailed preparation history of the solid samples @xcite and on the presence of minute fractions of he@xmath4 impurities@xcite .",
    "the more disordered are the he@xmath3 solids the larger is the supersolid signal .",
    "it can reach surprisingly large values when the solid is formed by a rapid freezing from the normal phase .",
    "it can be reduced to an unobservable level by annealing @xcite .",
    "it is by now very plausible that rapid freezing produces highly disordered samples and that disorder is at the origin of the experimental findings and of `` supersolid '' signals .",
    "different origins have been highlighted . a recent work in ref .   suggested that the _ core _ of dislocations could be superfluid . a phenomenological theory of the role of dislocations can be found in ref .  .",
    "following up ref .   a scenario to explain the experimental findings in terms of dislocation",
    "induced superfluidity has been put forward in ref .  .",
    "from the experimental point of view , the role of grain boundaries has been analyzed in ref .  .",
    "another idea introduced in refs .",
    "is that rapid freezing produces amorphous glassy solids that become supersolid at low temperature .",
    "this `` superglass '' phase has been detected in path - integral monte - carlo ( pimc ) numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "these results are encouraging but addressing real - time dynamics issues such as the stability and the dynamics of this phase is out of reach of pimc .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a complementary analytical approach that can give direct insight into these problems : this is precisely the purpose of this work .",
    "our strategy will be to focus on a model that displays a superglass phase and that can be concretely analyzed in some instances exactly and in others using accurate and controlled approximations at zero temperature .",
    "the model consists of bosonic particles interacting via a short - range potential in three dimensions .",
    "our approach is based on a mapping between quantum hamiltonians and ( classical ) fokker - planck operators which allows us to obtain results on ground state properties and time dependent correlation functions from the analysis of the stochastic dynamics of a classical equilibrium system .",
    "this connection , already well - known for a few decades @xcite , has been quite used and further studied in the context of the so called rokshar - kivelson points @xcite .",
    "we will mainly focus on systems of interacting bosons whose classical counterpart ( via the above mapping ) is a system of hard spheres .",
    "these are known to undergo a crystal@xcite or a glass  @xcite transition at high density .",
    "the glass transition takes place when crystallization is avoided ( either by fast compression or using different types of particles ) .",
    "the usefulness of the classical - quantum mapping is that it allows us to obtain highly non - trivial , very accurate or , at instances , exact results on the original quantum many - body problem by translating all the knowledge on the brownian dynamics of hard spheres .",
    "in particular we will be able to work out in detail the properties of the superglass , supercrystal and superfluid phases .",
    "the drawback of this mapping is that the resulting quantum solids are quite different from real he@xmath3 crystals , mainly because of the much smaller zero - point motion and of some peculiar properties of the excitation spectrum to be discussed below .",
    "the results of our work go beyond the physics of solid he@xmath3 because the superglass phase can emerge also in other physical contexts , in particular strongly interacting bosonic mixtures of cold atoms .",
    "furthermore , another motivation for our study is to analyze a quantum glassy phase not induced by quenched disorder .",
    "there are in fact very few examples @xcite of that , especially not relying on mean - field or large-@xmath5 approximations .",
    "in the following section the mapping between classical fokker - planck operators and quantum hamiltonians is presented .",
    "in particular we will obtain the relation between the classical potential and its quantum counterpart .",
    "we will work it out for identical bosons as well as for mixtures of bosons ( mixtures may be relevant for cold atomic systems ) .",
    "furthermore , we shall introduce the model that we will focus on in this paper , which is the quantum counterpart of classical brownian hard spheres .",
    "the quantum potential is still a hard sphere one but it has in addition a sticky part at contact ( and also a 3-body interaction at contact ) .    in section iv we shall work out the zero temperature phase diagram of the quantum model as a function of the density @xmath6 .",
    "actually we will use instead of the density the packing fraction @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the sphere diameter ) which is a more natural variable for hard spheres .",
    "we find three possible phases : superfluid , supercrystal and superglass . at low packing fraction",
    "the system is superfluid but at @xmath9 it has a first order transition toward a supercrystal phase .",
    "the transition toward the superglass phase takes place at higher packing fractions , @xmath10 .",
    "it can be achieved only if the transition toward the crystal is avoided either by considering mixtures or compressing fast the liquid phase .",
    "we will obtain quantitative results for the condensate fraction .",
    "in particular for the superglass phase we will introduce and compute an observable , akin to the edwards - anderson parameter for spin glasses , that quantifies the inhomogeneity of the condensate wavefunction in space .",
    "the values of the condensate fraction turn out to be very small .",
    "this is likely due to the particular model we have chosen which admits as ground state wavefunction the gibbs measure of hard spheres .",
    "however , exact results guarantee that , although small , the condensate fraction is non - zero , _",
    "i.e. _ it is not an artifact . in section",
    "v we focus on the real time quantum dynamics close to the transition from the superfluid to the superglass .",
    "in particular we obtain the behavior of the density correlations as a function of time as well as the time dependent condensate fluctuations .",
    "both correlation functions show a similar behavior . approaching the superglass from the superfluid",
    ", one finds that after a rapid oscillating decay , there is a plateau indicating frozen amorphous density and condensate fluctuations . on much larger timescales these frozen fluctuations",
    "the transition to the superglass phase takes place when the timescale for this second relaxation goes to infinity ( or , practically , becomes larger than any relevant experimental timescale . ) .",
    "this behavior is actually very reminiscent of the one of classical supercooled liquids approaching their structural glass transition . in section",
    "vi we will generalize our model in order to make it more realistic .",
    "in fact , within the classical - quantum mapping approach , the energy of the ground state is always zero . in order to discuss the behavior of the pressure , the order of the transitions and the superfluid properties we shall add a small perturbation to the quantum potential originally introduced in section iii .",
    "this will allow us to show that the transition from the superfluid to the superglass is unusual to the extent that it is thermodynamically first order but has also some characteristics of second order transitions .",
    "finally , conclusions , perspectives and relations to experiments and numerical simulations will be presented in section vii .",
    "the superglass is an amorphous quantum many - body state of interacting bosons . to find such",
    "a state starting from a generic quantum hamiltonian of interacting particles is a daunting task . in this paper , we take an approach that allows us to argue for such a phase in a well controlled way , by constructing a _ local _",
    "quantum many - body hamiltonian whose ground state is known exactly and can be argued to be a glassy state at large enough densities .",
    "this formulation is motivated by a generic result stating that for systems without a sign problem there is a simple connection between quantum hamiltonians and the stochastic dynamics of a classical system .",
    "this can be used to construct interesting hamiltonians with real and non - negative ground state wavefunctions related to classical equilibrium boltzmann - gibbs measures .",
    "the connection is far - reaching since it allows one to obtain controlled and highly non - trivial results on the phase diagram and dynamical properties of a quantum many body problem  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been used to construct an efficient algorithm for quantum monte carlo at zero temperature  @xcite .    here",
    "we shall explore this classical - quantum connection for the particular case of bosonic point particles , following the standard route for mapping classical langevin dynamics for a many - particle system and its associated fokker - planck operator to a schrdinger operator  @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath5 particles whose evolution is determined by the following langevin equations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are friction coefficients , @xmath13 is a gaussian white thermal noise with variance @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 is the temperature ( with @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 and @xmath18 run from @xmath19 to the spatial dimension @xmath20 ( henceforth the boldface notation indicates vectors ) .",
    "the potential will eventually be assumed to be the sum of ( symmetric ) pair potentials , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",

    "the zero eigenvalue corresponds as it can be readily checked to the stationary distribution which is the equilibrium gibbs probability measure : @xmath27    setting for simplicity @xmath28 , the fokker - planck operator can be mapped into a hermitian quantum hamiltonian by a similarity transformation @xmath29 that leads to @xmath30 = \\sum_i \\frac{{\\bf p}_i^2}{2 m_i } + \\vv_n(\\{\\xx\\})\\ ] ] this expression corresponds to a hamiltonian for particles with mass @xmath31 and an effective potential which is the sum of a two body and three - body interaction : @xmath32 \\\\ & =   -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j \\neq i}\\frac{1}{\\g_i } \\nabla ^2   v_{ij}({\\bf x}_i-{\\bf    x}_j)+\\frac{1}{4 t } \\sum_{i ; j ( \\neq i ) ; j ' ( \\neq i ) } \\frac{1}{\\g_i } \\nabla v_{ij}({\\bf x}_i-{\\bf x}_j ) \\cdot \\nabla v_{ij'}({\\bf x}_i-{\\bf    x}_{j ' } ) \\;.",

    "this also implies that all the eigenvalues @xmath35 corresponding to the fokker - planck operator are identical to the ones of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , this relation , together with eq .  ( [ gibbsp ] ) , allows one to obtain straightforwardly the ground state wavefunction of the quantum problem , which is of the jastrow form  @xcite : @xmath37 \\ .\\ ] ] the logic of the approach we pursue hereafter is the following : we take as starting point hamiltonians with many - body potentials of the form eq .",
    "( [ effectivepotential ] ) , for which the jastrow form eq .",
    "( [ jastrow ] ) is exact . in general , wavefunctions of this form",
    "lead to more than two - body interactions @xmath38 ( note that also he@xmath3 has weak higher order interactions ) .",
    "the important point is that if the two - body potentials @xmath39 are short - ranged ( _ i.e. _ local ) potentials , then @xmath38 is also local , and thus the many - body hamiltonians on which we focus are _ local _ ( non - local hamiltonian may lead to pathological behaviors ) .    because we know exactly the ground state wavefunction , and it is related to a boltzmann - gibbs measure for a classical system , quantum static correlation functions can be computed in terms of classical static correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we shall show and noticed by henley  @xcite , the mapping generalizes also to dynamical correlation functions .",
    "hence , we will obtain quantum dynamical correlation functions at zero temperature by analytic continuation of classical ( stochastic ) dynamical correlation functions .    to simplify the notations , in the following we will fix @xmath40 and @xmath41 . together with @xmath28 ,",
    "this fixes the units in both classical and quantum problems . as a consequence",
    "the masses in the quantum problem read @xmath42 .",
    "let us first consider the simplest case of @xmath5 identical _ bosons",
    "_ characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ quantumh ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is important to remark that since the particles are bosons one has to consider only many - body states that are completely symmetric under permutation of particles , and study _ only _ observables that are invariant under permutation of particles ( e.g. the density - density correlator ) .",
    "this is clearly not a difficult constraint to handle since the jastrow form ( [ jastrow ] ) with @xmath46 is completely symmetric .",
    "furthermore , even in the study of dynamical correlations ( section  [ sec:5 ] ) this will not be a problem because if one starts from a probability law completely symmetric under permutation of particles , the symmetrization carries over to all later times .",
    "this follows trivially from the fokker - planck evolution eq .",

    "it is also worthwhile considering binary mixture of bosons .",
    "in fact the superglass phase we shall discuss in the following will emerge only when crystallization is avoided .",
    "we expect , as it is the case for classical systems , that this can be obtained either by fast compression of the liquid state or by considering mixtures of bosons .",
    "mixtures typically induce a frustration effect on the crystalline phase whose energy , as a consequence , increases .",
    "instead the glass phase , thanks to its disordered structure , is less affected and , hence , starts to compete in terms of energy ( or dynamical basin of attraction ) with the crystalline phase .",
    "this conclusion , which we expect to be correct on physical grounds , is also suggested by approaches based on variational wavefunctions of the jastrow form eq .",
    "( [ jastrow ] ) .",
    "these types of wavefunctions map the quantum problem into a classical one and are very effective in describing a number of the observed phenomena in the quantum bose fluid .",
    "lennard - jones type potentials ( as classical potentials in the exponent of the jastrow wavefunction ) have been considered by mcmillan  @xcite , francis , chester and reatto  @xcite in the study of he@xmath3 superfluids . for a single species of particles ,",
    "such interaction potentials lead to classical liquid states and , at very high densities , might lead to a crystalline state  @xcite . within jastrow - like approaches , thanks to this analogy with classical systems , we expect the physical effect induced by mixtures to be similar to what happens in classical liquids .    as a consequence ,",
    "we conjecture that for a binary mixture , a quantum glassy state may emerge at high enough densities .",
    "experimentally , the binary mixture can be obtained using two species of bosonic atoms , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it may be the case that we do not need to develop a condensate fraction for both species @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; it would suffice to have a superglass of , say , species @xmath53 , while species @xmath54 always remains normal , with its role solely that of enabling the formation of the glassy state .",
    "these type of binary mixture can be obtained in cold atom experiments .",
    "the generalization of the results of the previous section to a binary mixture is presented in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] . in the following",
    "we will focus on the identical boson system but one must keep in mind that to stabilize the glassy phase one may have to consider mixtures or fast compression of the liquid state .",
    "thus , our strategy will be to study directly the glass phase of identical particles and translate the results to the mixture case where this phase actually exists .",
    "let us investigate what quantum bosonic system in particular corresponds to a classical hard sphere problem upon the mapping above .",
    "the motivation for this study is that the classical hard sphere packing is a well studied problem in the context of glasses for large enough packing fractions  @xcite , and we will be able to use these results for substantiating the notion of the superglass state .",

    "although in principle the form of the potential is not very important as long as it is infinite for @xmath58 and zero for @xmath59 ( in the @xmath57 limit ) , the previous form makes the following discussion particularly easy .",
    "we also set @xmath60 and @xmath61 for simplicity : indeed , even if the units have already been fixed , @xmath62 is irrelevant in the @xmath63 limit , while a change in @xmath56 is equivalent to a change in the density .",

    "( notice that we have set @xmath60 and @xmath67 in the text.),width=321 ]    the form of the pair potential in the large @xmath68 limit is simple :    * for @xmath69 , the pair potential is zero because the exponential terms go very fast to zero .",
    "* for @xmath70 , the pair potential goes to infinity .",
    "although the second term is negative , the third one is much larger than the first two and dominates .",
    "* very close to @xmath71 , within a window that shrinks to zero in the large @xmath68 limit , the potential becomes negative and goes to minus infinity .",
    "indeed , for @xmath71 , its value is @xmath72 .",
    "the potential remains attractive ( negative ) on an interval of size @xmath73 .",
    "this attractive part of the potential is responsible for the fact that ground state wavefunction does not vanish ( or is discontinuous ) at the contact between hard spheres .",
    "particles can stay close to contact paying a lot of kinetic energy , @xmath74 , and gaining a lot of potential energy , also @xmath75 .",
    "+    let us now consider the 3-body term .",
    "it can be written as : @xmath76 where for a given triplet of particles @xmath77 one has @xmath78 and @xmath79 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair ] ) .",
    "the form of the 3-body potential in the large @xmath68 limit is simple : it is non - zero only if _ both _ particles @xmath80 and @xmath81 have a non - zero overlap with particle @xmath82 .",
    "when there is a finite overlap ( in the large @xmath68 limit ) the contribution coming from the 3-body term , which can be actually positive or negative , is always smaller than the one coming from the sum of the pair contributions @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , it can be neglected .",
    "the outcome coming from the pair interactions is that all particle configurations with finite particle overlaps are simply excluded by the hilbert space . when both @xmath64 and @xmath85 are very close to @xmath19 , of the order @xmath73 , the 3-body term will give rise to a non - negligible contribution similar to the one studied for the pair contribution .",
    "the main difference is that it can be attractive or repulsive depending on the relative orientation of @xmath86 and @xmath87 . as a conclusion",
    "the interaction between particles is the hard sphere one plus a contact term that is sticky for the pair contribution and that can be repulsive or attractive for the triplet term depending on the geometry of the triplet .",
    "here we make use of the relationship between the classical and quantum models , and study the zero temperature phases of the quantum system introduced in the previous section iii.d .",
    "we will work out the properties of the quantum phases by using the classical gibbs measure defined by the square of the jastrow wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on a system of @xmath5 identical bosons with the particular interaction , discussed in the previous section , that corresponds to a jastrow state with an hard sphere potential . having fixed @xmath67 ,",
    "the control parameter in this case is the particle density @xmath88 of the particles , or the _ packing fraction _ @xmath89 .",
    "let us recall first the phase diagram of classical hard spheres@xcite ( see top of fig .",

    "the system is liquid , and upon increasing the density it undergoes a first order phase transition to a crystalline state , that is arranged in a face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "moreover , a metastable glassy phase can be obtained in the classical problem if the density is increased fast enough or in presence of small bi - dispersity ( binary mixtures ) .",
    "this glass phase can be compressed until the random close packing packing ( rcp ) fraction @xmath90 .",

    "below we discuss the property of these three quantum phases in some detail with particular emphasis on their one - particle density matrix and bose condensate fraction .",
    "we will treat the glass phase as a true equilibrium phase because , as we have already discussed , it will emerge when crystallization is avoided either by fast compression of the liquid state or considering suitable binary mixtures .",

    "our strategy will consist in deriving results for the quantum glassy phase starting from the known results for the classical glassy phase .",
    "we will also provide quantitative results using the replica approach which has been shown to give a reasonable description of numerical simulation results  @xcite .",
    "our working hypothesis is that an ideal classical glass transition indeed takes place : at low density ( or packing fraction ) the system is in the liquid phase and above a critical density ( assuming that crystallization is avoided ) there is a thermodynamic transition toward an amorphous state of matter which is the glass state . in the glassy state",
    "the system can be frozen in many different amorphous configuration or states .",
    "note that assuming that the classical glass transition is a real thermodynamic phase transition just simplifies the presentation .",
    "in fact , even if this is not the case in reality , one can translate and generalize all the following discussion : amorphous thermodynamic states will then become just metastable amorphous configurations in which the system is trapped on the relevant experimental timescales .      following the strategy outlined above , we will therefore assume that at the ( classical ) glass transition , the gibbs measure @xmath154 splits into a very large number of thermodynamic states @xmath155 : latexmath:[\\[\\label{decomposition }    operative description of @xmath155 is the boltzmann measure obtained by coupling the system to an infinitesimal non - homogeneous external potential , @xmath157 , that forces the system into the state @xmath17 : @xmath158 note that clearly the potential @xmath159 must be chosen symmetric under particle exchanges .",
    "from the above definition it follows that the states @xmath160 are also completely bose symmetric like the full boltzmann measure @xmath161 .",

    ", as discussed above , the bogoliubov theory of the unperturbed model leads to a quadratic spectrum due to a hidden symmetry . on the contrary , the perturbation @xmath325 breaks the hidden symmetry , and in its presence the usual bogoliubov theory applies and leads to a linear spectrum .",
    "using perturbation theory at first order , it is straightforward to show that @xmath326 @xmath190 is the correlation function of the hard sphere liquid at density @xmath313 .",
    "one can show by explicit computation for a suitable specific form of @xmath327 that , at the glass transition density @xmath323 , the ground state energy is continuous but its first derivative has a jump .    the pressure @xmath319 ( as a function of the chemical potential @xmath322 ) is the legendre transform of @xmath309 : @xmath328 \\ , \\ ] ] therefore @xmath329 \\ , \\\\",
    "p(\\rho ) & = \\r^2 \\frac{d}{d\\r } e(\\rho ) \\ . \\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] from the above expressions one can see that @xmath319 is continuous and convex as @xmath309 , while @xmath320 and @xmath321 have a jump in @xmath323 , see fig .",
    "[ p ] . therefore the glass transition , that is a second order transition in the classical case , looks like a first order transition in the zero - temperature quantum problem .",
    "this is similar to previous results on quantum mean field glass models with quenched disorder , see refs . .",
    "on the other hand the properties of the first order transition are quite different . in the case of mean field",
    "quantum glass models the glass and liquid are really different phases and the glass phase does not appear ( via density fluctuations that are frozen on timescales diverging at the transition ) in a continuous way from the liquid , contrary to what happens for the superglass .",
    "the sound velocity is now determined by @xmath330 \\neq 0 \\ .\\ ] ] general arguments  @xcite show that if @xmath331 , then @xmath332 ; assuming equality the feynman formula gives @xmath333 , consistently with the existence of sound waves .",
    "therefore the system in this case has a finite critical velocity and is superfluid .",
    "note that in the glass the first peak of the structure factor , that determines @xmath334 $ ] , is close to the one of the liquid , suggesting that the critical velocity should stay close to the one of the liquid .",
    "still it is known ( in helium ) that the precise determination of the critical velocity is complicated and depends on the geometry , therefore estimating precisely its value in the superglass phase is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper we presented and analyzed a concrete model of interacting bosons that displays unambiguously , in addition to superfluid and supercrystal phases , metastable superfluid and superglass phases .",
    "this shows concretely that a system can be at the same time glassy , _",
    "i.e. _ displaying very slow dynamics for the structural degrees of freedom , and supersolid , _",
    "i.e. _ showing a superfluid component .",
    "note that there is no paradox , exactly as there is none for the supercrystal .",
    "indeed , leggett in his original paper@xcite `` can a solid be superfluid ? '' explicitly mentioned the possibility of super - amorphous solids .",
    "the exact ground state of the model we considered is known by construction : it is a jastrow wavefunction with a hard sphere potential form .",
    "we constructed the quantum hamiltonian for which this wavefunction is exact via a mapping to brownian motion of classical hard spheres , following the connection between the fokker - planck operator for the classical stochastic dynamics and the schrdinger operator describing the associated quantum system .",
    "this mapping allows us to understand the physics of the superglass phase by using results from the well - studied problem of densely - packed hard spheres .    our findings , which were summarized in sec .",
    "[ summary ] , are most simply conveyed through fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] . by changing the density of particles",
    ", one goes from a superfluid phase to a supercrystal via a first order phase transition .",
    "if the density is increased fast or in case of ( binary ) mixtures , one reaches a metastable superfluid state , and if the density is further increased , one reaches the superglass phase .",
    "the analysis we carried out for the hard sphere jastrow wavefunction can be extended for other systems for which the jastrow wavefunction corresponds to a classical potential leading to glassy dynamics .",
    "classically , mixtures may become glasses at certain compositions , for example 80%/20% mixtures of two species of particles interacting via lennard - jones potentials  @xcite .",
    "the problem of binary mixtures is interesting in that one could potentially realize the system in cold atomic gases , where the relative fractions of two species could be controlled .",
    "we have worked out the correspondence between the classical and quantum problems for binary mixtures in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "following the same reasoning as in our work on the hard sphere wavefunctions , the binary mixtures can display superglass behavior as long as the mapped classical problem does so .",
    "the usefulness of the classical to quantum mapping is that it allows us to make precise and concrete statements about the nature of the ground state of the devised hamiltonian . by construction ,",
    "the ground state energy is exactly zero , and thus one must add a small perturbation so as to obtain a non - zero speed of sound , as we have done in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "we have added a 2-body potential as perturbation , because we could make use of the knowledge of the density - density correlation @xmath190 in obtaining the effect of the additional interaction on the ground state energy , pressure , compressibility , and sound velocity of the system .",
    "it is an interesting possibility that if , as opposed to the 2-body perturbation , one adds a 3-body potential , one could compensate the 3-body term that arises from the classical to quantum mapping . in other words , we speculate that by removing ( or reducing ) the 3-body term by a compensating perturbation , one could achieve a quantum hamiltonian with a glassy ground state , only 2-body terms , and a finite sound velocity .",
    "this could perhaps be tested numerically , by considering the system with the potential in eq .",
    "( [ pairpotential ] ) alone . moreover , if the short - ranged `` sticky '' part of the eq .",
    "( [ pairpotential ] ) potential is removed , this may not substantially change the results . at least , we expect the system to be glassy as the original one ( the question of superfluidity is instead a more tricky one and needs further investigations ) .",
    "the intuitive reason is as follows : for dense packings and a hard sphere potential , if one turns down the kinetic energy ( say by `` increasing '' the mass of the particles ) , thus making the system more classical , one should recover the physics of the classical hard sphere system .",
    "because the packings are dense , turning up the kinetic energy ( say by `` decreasing '' the mass of the particles ) , should not favor very much transitions between a glassy state @xmath184 to another @xmath261 . because of the hard sphere potential ( basically infinite on the scales of the kinetic energy ) , we do not expect , at a dense packing , that quantum fluctuations will reduce considerably ( at least for not too small @xmath335 ) the timescales to escape from classical glassy configurations .",
    "concerning the superglass transition , we found it to be first order but quite unusual .",
    "it is different from the quantum first order transitions found for mean field glassy models in refs .",
    ". it would be interesting to develop and study mean field models ( or mean field approximations ) able to reproduce our results and the superglass phase transitions .",
    "one of the main motivations is that they could allow one to analyze the finite temperature regime which is clearly out of reach of the approach developed in this work . in particular",
    ", it would be very interesting to apply quantum mode coupling theory@xcite ( qmct ) to the model we focus on .",
    "it would be very interesting to know whether qmct predicts quantum correlation functions that are connected to the one predicted by classical mct via the classical quantum - mapping we employed .",
    "if yes , this would mean that qmct is able to capture this unusual first order phase transition toward the superglass phase and it would allow one to study its finite temperature extension .",
    "finally , let us discuss preliminary results for he@xmath3 which is one of the original motivations of our work .",
    "jastrow wavefunctions have been used extensively to describe the ground state of he@xmath3 in both fluid  @xcite and solid  @xcite phases .",
    "therefore it is tempting to try to study the superglass phase of he@xmath3 by using the jastrow wavefunction as a variational wavefunction .",
    "for he@xmath3 it was found that the liquid phase is well described by a potential @xmath336 .",
    "we then computed the glass transition density for this potential following ref .  .",
    "we found that the superglass transition takes place at a density @xmath337 and a very small jump in the first derivative of @xmath309 at @xmath323 , the relative variation of @xmath338 being of the order of @xmath339 .",
    "unfortunately , the value of @xmath323 is 10 times higher than the density at which the superglass has been observed in ref .  .",
    "however , it is well known that the jastrow wavefunction overestimates the liquid - crystal transition for he@xmath3 and , more generally , provides a poor description of the solid phases .",
    "a more refined investigation should involve shadow - like wavefunctions  @xcite , and we plan to report on such a study in a future publication where more details on the jastrow wavefunction will also be given .",
