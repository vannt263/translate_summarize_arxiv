    "statistical mechanics was founded by maxwell , boltzmann and gibbs for systems with a very large number of particles . given their different approaches , boltzmann and gibbs are often considered as the champions of two different points of view about statistical mechanics .",
    "this common _ vulgata _ takes gibbs as the founder of the ensemble approach , and boltzmann as the promoter of a dynamical theory based on the ergodic hypothesis ; according to this tradition , modern textbooks @xcite use gibbs s terminology for the ensembles ( i.e. microcanonical , canonical and grandcanonical ) .",
    "actually , both ergodicity and ensembles are boltzmann s inventions ; more detailed discussions about boltzmann , gibbs , and the origin of the statistical mechanics are contained in the absolutely recommendable book by cercignani @xcite , and the papers by klein @xcite , lebowitz @xcite , and gallavotti @xcite .",
    "the gibbs approach to statistical mechanics uses the general concept of ensembles without any reference to the precise origin of such an idea .",
    "the relevant literature is huge @xcite : sometimes the ensembles are derived from philosophical considerations , other times from information - theoretic , and even from anthropocentric considerations . in van kampen s words , sometimes this produces _ a slightly mystic aura _ , which diverts the attention away from the physical meaning of the ensemble theory @xcite .",
    "ergodic theory begins with boltzmann s attempt to justify the determination of average values in kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "macroscopic systems contain a very large number ( of the order of the avogadro s number ) of particles ; this implies the practical necessity of a statistical description .",
    "since in any macroscopic observation the time scale is much larger than the microscopic time scale , over which the molecular changes take place , an experimental measurement is actually the result of an observation on a single system , during which it goes through a very large number of microscopic states .",
    "thus , one may assume that the outcome of the measurement of an observable @xmath2 is an average performed over all these states : @xmath3 where the vector @xmath4 lies in the @xmath5 - dimensional phase space @xmath6 , gives the state of the system at time @xmath1 and , in general , depends on the initial state @xmath7 . according to the usual notation , the components of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , indicate the position and momentum vectors of the @xmath11-th particle .",
    "obviously , it is impossible to obtain the complete description @xmath12 of the microscopic state of the system at the initial time , for such high - dimensional systems as those relevant in statistical mechanics .",
    "this means that , if @xmath13 depends too strongly on the initial condition , no statistical predictions can be made , independently of how difficult it may be to integrate the equations of motion .",
    "the ergodic hypothesis allows us to overcome this obstacle , stating that for sufficiently large @xmath14 , the average @xmath13 depends only on the system energy , in the sense that it takes the same values for _ almost all _ the trajectories on the given constant energy surface .",
    "this allows us to identify the time average with a phase space average : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the microcanonical probability density , except for a negligible set of initial conditions .",
    "the validity of such an equality eliminates the necessity of determining the initial state of the system , and of solving the hamilton s equations . whether ( [ ergo1 ] ) is valid or not , i.e.  whether it is possible to substitute the temporal average with an average in phase space , constitutes the essence of the ergodic problem in physics .",
    "the relevance of this issue is evident : let the statistical properties of a large isolated system be properly described by the microcanonical ensemble , then it is not difficult to show that a small part of the given system , which is still large at the microscopic scale , is described by the canonical ensemble .",
    "we stress that , in this context , the ensemble is just a useful mathematical tool , and one should not forget that thermodynamics , as a physical theory , is developed to describe the properties of _ single _ systems , made of many microscopic , interacting parts . although some may find hard to distinguish between `` thermodynamic systems '' and other systems of interest in statistical physics , in this paper , when referring to a thermodynamic system , we have in mind a system that is characterized by macroscopic properties such as its temperature , while many other , equally interesting physical systems , do not even need to have a temperature .",
    "the distinction makes sense because different laws describe the behaviour of the different systems .    to justify eq .",
    "( [ ergo1 ] ) in physical systems , khinchin s point of view clearly states that the success of statistical mechanics techniques is mainly due to the many degrees of freedom , while the underlying dynamics play only a minor role . in his celebrated book _",
    "mathematical foundations of statistical mechanics _",
    "@xcite , he presents some important results on the ergodic problem which do not rest on the metrical transitivity of the dynamics , which ( [ ergo1 ] ) requires .",
    "khinchin s idea on the ergodic problem in statistical mechanics is that one should profit from the fact that macroscopic systems have a large number of degrees of freedom , and that the physical observables for which ( [ ergo1 ] ) is required to hold are not generic regular functions , as in the dynamical systems approach to ergodicity . in other words , taking into account the large number of degrees of freedom should be enough to obtain the validity of the equivalence between time averages and ensemble averages for the small class of relevant observables .",
    "moreover , it is fair for physical purposes to accept the failure of the ergodic hypothesis for a set of initial conditions @xmath7 which is a negligible fraction of the phase space , or that becomes negligible when @xmath17 . in a nutshell ,",
    "khinchin s point of view is that statistical mechanics works independently of the mathematical validity of the dynamical systems notion of ergodicity , because the physically relevant observables are practically constant , except in an irrelevant region of the constant energy surface .",
    "this makes marginal the role of the dynamics , for equilibrium states , and the existence of good statistical properties is mainly due to the large number of degrees of freedom , i.e.  to @xmath18 .    the ergodic approach , whether in its strong or its weak version , is a natural way to introduce probabilistic concepts in a deterministic context : in experimental situations one deals with a unique system with many degrees of freedom , whose microstates explore with given frequency the different regions of the phase space",
    ". consequently , the ergodic hypothesis seems to provide the appropriate tools for the equilibrium statistical mechanics to be founded on physical grounds , using a frequentistic interpretation of the probability distributions .",
    "the other way of connecting probability and dynamics ( which does not contrast with boltzmann s point of view ) is to take into account the unavoidable uncertainty on the initial conditions .",
    "this approach , originally due to maxwell , considers that there are _ a great many systems the properties of which are the same , and that each of these is set in motion with a different set values for the coordinates and momenta _ @xcite .",
    "the discovery of deterministic chaos , implying that even deterministic systems with a few degrees of freedom may present some statistical features typical of probabilistic evolutions , forced the physicists to reconsider from a new perspective the foundations of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "moreover one may also find useful to define , formally , `` thermodynamic '' system any system with ergodic dynamics such that ( [ ergo1 ] ) applies .",
    "in this paper we will consider only systems with many degrees of freedom , such that , usually , the thermodynamic observables have negligible fluctuations .",
    "the situation is much more intricate for the non equilibrium problems than for equilibrium ones , and even after many years of debate , there is no general agreement about the fundamental ingredients needed for statistical mechanics to hold .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a contribution for the understanding of the role of deterministic chaos , and of coarse - graining procedures , in non equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular the paper concerns the problem of the growth of entropy .",
    "these issues are the source of heated debates , on which only partial agreement has been reached within the statistical mechanics community .",
    "recent examples of this are given by the debate on irreversibility originated by lebowitz s paper @xcite , and the partly contrasting views on irreversible entropy production reported in @xcite .- space rather than in @xmath6-space . ]",
    "our results support the view that systems of many noninteracting chaotic particles may properly describe , for some aspects , highly rarefied gases , or knudsen gases in an irregular container , even if a normal thermodynamic behavior may be absent .",
    "this is a very delicate issue : it is known @xcite that some form of irreversibility may be found in systems of non interacting particles .",
    "for example , free particles in a box show homogenization of the spatial coordinates ; in irregularly shaped boxes the distribution of velocity can become isotropic ; but , in the absence of interactions , a relaxation of velocities to a maxwellian ( that we call , as noted above , a _",
    "normal thermodynamic behaviour _ ) is impossible .",
    "we find , in fact , that the @xmath6 or @xmath19 space graining required for noninteracting particle systems to look thermodynamic - like have an equally arbitrary character , with no physical meaning , and play an essentially identical role in both spaces .",
    "differently , we are going to show in this paper that , in the case of interacting chaotic particles , a characteristic scale naturally emerges in the @xmath19 space .",
    "this may be interpreted as the scale at which the diffusive , small scale behavior due to the interaction first smoothes the fragmented structures created by the chaotic dynamics .",
    "in this case , the coarse graining in @xmath19-space shows completely different features from the coarse graining in @xmath6 space : in particular , the growth of the boltzmann entropy results independent of the resolution , as long as the observation scale is finer than the characteristic scale .",
    "we stress that to achieve this result , it is of fundamental importance that the number of particles must be large , which is not required for the coarse graining in @xmath6-space .",
    "these facts are reflected in the different nonequilibrium behaviours of the boltzmann and gibbs entropies .",
    "indeed , the constancy of the gibbs entropy can be consistently accommodated in this framework .",
    "if one accepts , as we do , that the gibbs canonical ensemble does yield the correct equilibrium thermodynamics , then the dynamical invariance of the gibbs entropy may provide a simple interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite . one considers the ensemble of points in @xmath6 space , that are compatible with the values of the macroscopic variables @xmath20 , defining the initial equilibrium thermodynamic state , and that are weighted by the suitable gibbs density @xmath21 . for large systems",
    ", the quantity @xmath22 allows to determine a phase space region @xmath23 , whose volume is @xmath24 $ ] , containing the `` reasonably probable '' microstates . as a consequence of an adiabatic change of state ,",
    "the microstates in @xmath23 evolve , and after a sufficiently long time @xmath14 , so that a new equilibrium is attained , they occupy the new region @xmath25 , whose volume , because of the liouville equation , is still @xmath26 . however , the quantities defining the new thermodynamic equilibrium are @xmath27 , evolved from @xmath20 .",
    "these values define the new gibbs density @xmath28 , with a support essentially contained in a region @xmath29 of volume @xmath30 $ ] . since we accept that , at equilibrium , @xmath31 , the second law of thermodynamics requires that @xmath32 .",
    "what is important to note here is that @xmath28 , and therefore @xmath33 , is not determined by the evolution of the initial @xmath21 , it is constructed by the evolved values of the macrovariables @xmath20 .",
    "a demonstration of the second law in statistical mechanics , in this framework , is equivalent to show that the microstates , compatible with the set of macroscopic variables , suitable to describe the thermodynamic system at hand , during an adiabatic evolution occupy phase - space regions of increasing volumes @xcite .",
    "this fact guarantees the experimental reproducibility of the process . on the other hand , as jaynes writes @xcite , `` any really satisfactory demonstration of the second law must therefore be based on a different approach than coarse - graining [ of @xmath34 '' , since `` the decrease of @xmath35 [ a coarse - grained version of @xmath36 is due only to the artificial coarse - graining operation and it can not therefore have any physical significance ... '' .    in the case of a dilute gas , a useful macroscopic variable",
    "to define the thermodynamic state of the system , is the single particle distribution function @xmath37 . in this case , and only in this case , the logarithm of the volume occupied by the compatible microstates is given by minus the boltzmann @xmath38-function : @xmath39 .",
    "so , for a dilute gas , while the gibbs entropy , as always , is expected to be constant , the boltzmann entropy takes the form : @xmath40 and is expected to increase , as lanford @xcite demonstrated to be true , in a suitable limit .",
    "most of the ideas discussed in the present paper are known .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite for the graining in phase space induced by a graining in @xmath19-space and the choice of macro - variables , and for the relation between the one - particle distribution function of interacting and of noninteracting particle systems . here , we express in a quantitative form , for a specific model , the qualitative statements made elsewhere , and we observe the existence of an intrinsic scale for the graining in the @xmath19-space of interacting particle systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to a brief summary of some basic facts about gibbs and boltzmann entropy and the link between deterministic chaos and statistical mechanics . in section iii",
    "we introduce a symplectic map simulating the time evolution of a large system , consisting of weakly interacting chaotic subsystems , and we show the behavior of the boltzmann entropy @xmath0 vs time .",
    "the main result is that , for interacting systems , @xmath0 is independent of the details of the coarse - graining procedure in @xmath19-space , if the graining is sufficiently fine , i.e.  the existence of an intrinsic graining scale in @xmath19-space .",
    "the most remarkable fact is that some numerical aspects ( e.g. the slope of @xmath0 for large enough @xmath1 ) basically depend only on the chaotic properties of the single subsystem , but the presence of the coupling is absolutely necessary . in section",
    "iv we show how one can interpret the results with a mechanism similar to that used for the decoherence in the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are in section v.",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian system of @xmath41 particles , and the vector @xmath42 which defines the microscopic state of the system .",
    "denoting by @xmath43 the probability for the microscopic state to be found in the phase space volume @xmath44 , one defines the gibbs entropy : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "since the time evolution @xmath47 is ruled by the hamilton equations , the liouville theorem implies that @xmath48 does not change in time .",
    "however , a coarse graining of @xmath49 by cells of size @xmath50 in the @xmath6 space ( the microscopic phase space ) leads to an increase of the coarse - grained gibbs entropy is the discretization of @xmath48 , by cells of size @xmath50 , except for an additive term @xmath51 . at fixed @xmath50 ,",
    "the term is constant and not relevant if one considers the entropy differences with respect to the initial values . ]",
    "@xmath52 where the coarse - grained probability @xmath53 is given by : @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the cell in the space @xmath6 of linear size @xmath50 centered in the point @xmath56 . when the system is chaotic , and the initial probability distribution is supported over a small region of linear size @xmath57",
    ", simple arguments suggest that @xmath58 increases linearly in time , after a short transient of length @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the system , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the first lyapunov exponent of the hamilton equations .",
    "the prediction of eq ( [ sinaigrowth ] ) is not always completely correct ; actually , it is valid only when intermittency effects are negligible @xcite . to make things simpler",
    "we will assume the validity of eq.([sinaigrowth ] ) , as commonly done in the presence of chaotic dynamics .",
    "many consider eq.([sinaigrowth ] ) as a proof of the deep connection between chaos and irreversibility .",
    "nevertheless , the result of eq.([sinaigrowth ] ) does not have a genuine thermodynamic character .",
    "this can be understood as follows :    * the quantity @xmath58 describes properties of the @xmath6 space that can not be computed from a single - system measurement ; * the time increase of @xmath58 depends on the coarse - graining procedure and this appears as a non - ontological result ; * the result of eq.([sinaigrowth ] ) is valid also for a generic , low - dimensional system - notice that one obtains the same result even in the case of chaotic non - interacting particles .",
    "consider now the boltzmann point of view , for a system of @xmath41 weakly interacting particles .",
    "the one - body probability distribution function @xmath37 , i.e. the probability density of finding a particle in a given volume of the @xmath19 space ( the single - particle space ) can be introduced without any reference to an ensemble of macroscopically identical systems , each represented by a point in @xmath6 space . in fact , take a single system made of a large number @xmath41 of identical particles , consider the discrete distribution @xmath64 and let @xmath41 grow . as the number @xmath41 of the particles of this _ unique _ system tends to infinity , a non - singular one - particle probability distribution ( in @xmath19 space )",
    "must be constructed space is required for the gibbs entropy to exista ] using eq.([singleparticle ] ) , and assuming that the physical space is @xmath65-dimensional , this can be done introducing a cell size @xmath50 in @xmath19 space , such that @xmath66 , i.e.that there is a statistically relevant number of particles in each cell .",
    "then , define the one - particle coarse grained distribution : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the heaviside step function and @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the coordinates of the center of each cell @xmath71 having linear size @xmath50 , and volume @xmath72 , in the appropriate units .",
    "the boltzmann entropy is then defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the regular @xmath19-space probability distribution , obtained in the @xmath17 , @xmath75 limit of eq.([singlemesh ] ) .",
    "the boltzmann entropy , as defined in eq.([bolentr ] ) , is a natural candidate for the description of dilute systems , for which it represents the logarithm of the volume occupied by the macrostate in the @xmath6 space : @xmath76 moreover , for dilute systems under the hypothesis of molecular chaos the celebrated boltzmann s h - theorem holds : @xmath77 the validity of the molecular chaos hypothesis has been demonstrated for the class of dilute systems in the grad limit , where @xmath78 and the interaction range goes to zero in order to keep the total cross section constant @xcite .",
    "some textbooks try to connect the two main approaches noticing that in dilute systems : @xmath79 which implies that @xmath80 .",
    "this attempt , however , is only partially justified , as there are at least two important conceptual differences between these approaches :    * the gibbs point of view is based on the ensemble , i.e.  on an abstract collection of macroscopically identical systems , and does not depend on the number of particles of which each system is made .",
    "differently , boltzmann s approach does not require an ensemble of copies of the same system , but needs @xmath81 , in order to compute @xmath37 for the single system .",
    "* the gibbs entropy deals with the @xmath6 space , and necessitates a coarse graining procedure in order to avoid the consequences of the liouville theorem , and to grow during an irreversible evolution . in the boltzmann approach ,",
    "the entropy can grow despite the liouville theorem , and the graining of the @xmath19-space is only introduced to deal with a smooth distribution .",
    "in addition , the validity of ( [ dens - prod ] ) must be interpreted _ cum grano salis _ , otherwise , because of ( [ growth ] ) , one would erroneously infer that the gibbs entropy ( [ gibbs ] ) grows .    in the following , we will show that for long enough times , and non - vanishing interaction , the growth of @xmath0 does not depend on the cell size , which is not the case for non - interacting systems .",
    "in order to discuss the points mentioned above in a concrete fashion , let us start with a system consisting of @xmath81 non - interacting particles moving in a periodic array of fixed convex scatterers , with which they collide elastically .",
    "the position of the scatterers should avoid the presence of collisionless trajectories , i.e.  the horizon should be finite .",
    "it is well established that such a system , commonly known as the lorentz gas is chaotic and displays asymptotic diffusion .",
    "the gibbs entropy of such a system obeys @xmath82 , while the coarse - grained entropy increases linearly with @xmath1 for @xmath83 ( before saturation ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of a single particle , and @xmath86 constant , because the particles are independent , and the probability distribution in phase space factorizes in @xmath41 identical terms .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of interacting particles , such as the case of the generalization of the lorentz gas given in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , the particles are not point - like , but have a finite size , and therefore they collide not only with the scatterers , but also among themselves .",
    "unfortunately , the study of such a system , for a sufficiently large number of particles , is very expensive from a computational point of view .",
    "however , a reasonable substitute for such a system , which shares its main features , can be given in terms of symplectic maps .",
    "for instance , one can consider a two - dimensional map , with one `` coordinate '' and one `` momentum '' , in place of each particle of the generalized lorentz gas , and one can introduce a form of interaction among these `` particles '' .",
    "thus we require that :    * in the absence of interactions among the `` particles '' , the single - particle dynamics in the corresponding @xmath19 space be chaotic and volume preserving ; * in the presence of interactions among particles , the dynamics of the whole system , described by the vector @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , be symplectic and volume preserving in the @xmath6 space",
    ".    the resulting model will be numerically easier to handle , still having some important properties of the particle system .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of the interacting case will not be volume preserving in the @xmath19 space .",
    "to this aim , we introduce the symplectic map : @xmath90 whose generating function @xmath91 is defined by : @xmath92 -\\nonumber\\\\ -\\frac{\\epsilon}{4\\pi } \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^n \\sum\\limits_{n =- m/2}^{m/2 } \\cos \\left[2\\pi ( q'_i - q'_{i+n } ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "@xmath94 is the number of fixed `` obstacles '' having positions @xmath95 , which play the role of the convex scatterers in the lorentz gas , and @xmath41 is the number of `` particles '' .",
    "the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 represent the interaction strength between particles and obstacles and among particles respectively . if @xmath98 one has free particles .",
    "the functional form of the generating function is reminiscent of the standard map , which is a paragon of symplectic dynamics .",
    "the boundary conditions on the variables are periodic , and the form of the interactions does not present discontinuities at the boundaries . in order to make the numerical simulations faster , we assume that each particle interacts only with a limited number @xmath99 of other particles .    substituting eq.([generfun ] ) into ( [ simpldyn ] )",
    ", one finds : @xmath100 + \\epsilon \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\frac{m}{2}}^{\\frac{m}{2 } } \\sin [ 2 \\pi \\left ( q'_i - q'_{i+n } \\right ) ] \\   \\mod \\ : 1 & \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] since the system is symplectic , the dynamics described by the points @xmath101 will preserve volumes in phase space .      in the following , we calculate the boltzmann single - particle distribution for a given cell size ( cf .",
    "eq.([singlemesh ] ) ) , as a function of time .",
    "then , we study the growth of the corresponding boltzmann entropy with time , defined by @xmath102 by varying the interaction strength @xmath97 and the cell size @xmath50 .",
    "note that , in our numerical computations , where we set @xmath103 for convenience , there are no _ a priori _ assumptions such as , for example , the hypothesis of molecular chaos . in other words , the quantity @xmath104 evolves according to the exact dynamics .",
    "let us comment on the use of the entropy defined in eq.([boltzmanngrowth ] ) for our dynamical system . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "this expression is correct ( in the sense that it measures the interesting volume of phase space ) only in the case of dilute systems . for systems , where the potential energy is not a tiny fraction of the total ,",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that a similar recipe may still be used , with the prescription to count only microstates corresponding to a fixed total energy @xmath105 .",
    "since we are considering the case of weakly interacting subsystems , the function @xmath106 is able to properly describe the macrostates of the system    first of all , we choose the number of obstacles @xmath94 and the parameter @xmath96 ( both related to the single - particle chaotic behavior ) in such a way that a ) the lyapunov exponent of the single particle dynamics is not too large and b ) there are no kam tori , of the kind which constitute barriers for the transport .",
    "one possible choice , which realizes this requirement is @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the obstacles positions are selected at random , with a uniform p.d.f .",

    "since @xmath59 increases as @xmath50 decreases , not only does the value of the entropy depend on the coarse graining , but the entropy growth depends ( for `` small '' @xmath1 ) on the resolution scale , as noticed in @xcite . * for weakly interacting systems , there is an effective cell size @xmath138 , such that if @xmath139 the value of @xmath140 does not depend on @xmath50 .",
    "here , the entropy growth is an objective property , meaning that the limit for @xmath141 of @xmath119 exists , is finite , hence is an intrinsic property of the system ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig3b ] ) . *",
    "the role of chaos in the limit of vanishing coupling is relevant , i.e. the slope of @xmath119 , for @xmath1 large enough , is given by the lyapunov exponent , but the existence of an effective cell size @xmath138 and the corresponding @xmath142 depends on the coupling strength @xmath97 , and on @xmath143 .",
    "* in the above procedure , i.e. in the evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ singlemesh ] ) and ( [ boltzmanngrowth ] ) , there are no assumptions like the hypothesis of molecular chaos or of system s dilution . from a mathematical point of view , we can define @xmath144 in eq.([boltzmanngrowth ] ) in full generality .",
    "however , we consider only the weakly interacting limit of small @xmath97 for the physical reason that only in such a case does @xmath121 afford an appropriate thermodynamic meaning .",
    "* for small values of @xmath97 , the time evolution of @xmath121 is different from the case @xmath112 only on very small graining scales ; in other words , the coupling is necessary for the `` genuine '' growth of the entropy , but it does not have any dramatic effect on @xmath121 at scales @xmath145 . indeed , as shown in fig.[fig5 ] , the noninteracting and the weakly interacting cases do not appear to be so different , in terms of the single - particle phase space distribution .",
    "snapshots of the evolution of the system in the single - particle projection of the phase space in the non - interacting case ( left ) , and in the interacting case with @xmath130 ( right ) and @xmath146 , at increasing times from top to bottom , as indicated in the figure.,width=9 ]",
    "the results of the previous section suggest the following interpretation : since the number of particles is large , one can expect that the effect of the interaction on each particle may be reasonably described by some kind of thermal bath . the single particle dynamics can then be mimicked by chaotic dynamics ( corresponding to the symplectic map of eq.([sistema ] ) with @xmath112 ) coupled to a noise term whose strength is @xmath147 : @xmath148 + \\sqrt{2d }   \\eta_i(t ) & \\quad \\mod \\ : 1 \\end{array } \\right .\\ ] ] where @xmath149 s are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian variables with zero mean and unitary variance , i.e. @xmath150 with this approximation , one basically assumes that @xmath121 evolves according to a discrete time fokker - planck equation .",
    "supposing that each particle gives an uncorrelated contribution to the noise term , one can roughly estimate the diffusion coefficient @xmath151 as @xmath152 . this heuristic estimate is well supported by numerical simulations of ( [ sistema ] ) : the quantity @xmath140 practically does not change at varying @xmath99 and @xmath97 , keeping @xmath153 constant .    in this framework",
    ", one can introduce a characteristic time @xmath154 , defined as the time in which the scale of the noise induced diffusion reaches the smallest scale originated by the deterministic chaotic dynamics @xcite . this definition of @xmath155 would correspond to @xmath156 introduced above .",
    "consequently , noting that the typical lengths due to noise and to chaos behave as @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively , the time @xmath154 may be estimated as the solution of the following transcendent equation : @xmath159 which holds on the spatial scales already reached by the diffusion process :    @xmath160    beyond which the value of the entropy still depends on the size of @xmath50 ( i.e.  the curves @xmath161 display the behavior @xmath162 ) .",
    "for example , in the case with @xmath130 , @xmath115 , @xmath146 and @xmath163 , one obtains @xmath164 , and , in agreement with our interpretation , for @xmath165 , all the curves in fig.[fig4 ] present the same slope compatible with the lyapunov exponent @xmath143 .    as a numerical check of the consistency of this approach",
    ", we studied system ( [ noisy ] ) .",
    "the results with a given @xmath151 should be compared with those of the deterministic system of eq.([sistema ] ) with @xmath166 the results , shown in fig.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , are qualitatively similar to the deterministic interacting case ( [ sistema ] ) , confirming the validity of our approach .",
    "a similar reasoning leads to the decoherence mechanism proposed by zurek and paz @xcite for the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics .",
    "we note that rather subtle conceptual points are present in the decoherence process for the semiclassical limit .",
    "this is so because two theories are involved ( classical and quantum mechanics ) with very different ontological status ( deterministic and non - deterministic , respectively ) .",
    "in our problem one has just a technical aspect : roughly speaking , one mimics the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy of a diluted system , consisting of weakly interacting chaotic particles , with a suitable fokker - planck equation .     numerical simulation of @xmath113 independent particles evolving according to ( [ noisy ] ) with @xmath167 .",
    "notice the similar qualitative behavior observed in fig.([fig3a]).,width=9 ]",
    "we have studied a system made of weakly coupled chaotic subsystems , which can be considered as a model of weakly interacting particles in an environment with convex obstacles . in the non interacting limit the behavior of the boltzmann entropy depends strongly on the coarse - graining resolution ( _ i.e. _ the cell size @xmath50 ) and therefore it can not be considered an intrinsic property of the system . by contrast , in the weakly interacting case the behavior of the boltzmann entropy becomes independent of the observation scale , assuming an objective character : for @xmath50 small enough , _",
    "i.e. _ smaller than @xmath168 , one observes a well defined shape of @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath1 .",
    "a remarkable fact is that @xmath169 , for @xmath171 , increases roughly linearly , with a slope given by the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the single ( non interacting ) chaotic system .",
    "summarizing , the interaction is necessary in order to have an effective cell size @xmath172 , thus changing the time behavior of the boltzmann entropy from `` subjective '' to `` objective '' , while other numerical aspects , like the slope of @xmath169for @xmath173 , are basically determined by the degree of chaos in the single subsystems .",
    "in addition , the effect of the weak coupling among the chaotic subsystems can be successfully modeled with a noisy term , and this allows us to estimate the value of @xmath174 .",
    "let us now comment on the relevance of these results for the case of noninteracting particles , in a host environment made of very heavy particles . if the `` obstacles '' were not infinitely massive , they would exchange energy with the independent particles , like the case of photons in a black body cavity .",
    "the photons do not interact with each other , but interact with the walls , reach a thermal equilibrium with them , and acquire a temperature for themselves .",
    "a similar behavior has been obtained in the lorentz - like model of ref.@xcite . in our framework",
    ", this would amount to set the interaction @xmath97 to zero , and to switch on an interaction between particles and obstacles which now are allowed to move . denoting with @xmath175 and",
    "@xmath176 the coordinate and the momentum of the @xmath177-th obstacle , one can introduce a symplectic dynamics , which generalizes ( [ simpldyn ] ) introducing a suitable interaction among the `` light '' particles and the heavy obstacles .",
    "of course now the @xmath6 space is given by @xmath178 .",
    "then , the `` light '' particles would be indirectly coupled with each other , as in @xcite : indeed , the heavy particles will play the role of interaction carrier particles and essentially we would fall back in the case considered in this paper . clearly , an interaction carried by heavy particles will be very weak and will involve very small scales , which are difficult to observe in numerical simulations ; nevertheless , there are no reasons to expect any conceptual difference from the scenario described in the present paper , which is consistent with the results of ref.@xcite .    of course , our results do not rule out noninteracting particle systems from the class of physically relevant models .",
    "in fact , they can be quite useful in describing highly rarefied gases , such as those of high vacuum pumps , or in the upper layers of the atmosphere .",
    "recently , they have also proven to be useful in the description of transport in microporous membranes @xcite , which are of a strong technological interest .",
    "therefore , credit must be given to those who have analyzed , and popularized these models , in the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similarly , we do not exclude that some version of the coarse - grained gibbs entropies may serve as useful characterizations of the state of certain systems .",
    "our results indicate that such systems , and such definitions of entropy , are not appropriate to understand , from a theoretical point of view , what happens in thermodynamic systems where the macroscopic evolutions toward equilibrium involve all the relevant microscopic degrees of freedom .",
