    "transition edge sensors ( tess ) have become the detectors of choice for current and future ground and space - based astronomical instruments . for example , the far infrared instrument safari that will operate on the joint jaxa / esa mission spica requires state - of - the - art tess with phonon - noise limited noise equivalent powers ( neps ) and fast response times.@xcite we recently reported our first measurements on ultra - low - noise mocu tess with saturation powers , response times and dark neps close - to safari requirements.@xcite these mocu tess have reached a high degree of sophistication in terms of their reliability in processing and reproducibility of characteristics .",
    "there are draw - backs , however , not least the complex chemistry of cu etching and the necessity for a passivating @xmath1 layer to prevent cu corrosion . the additional heat capacity of the passivation increases response times and contributes additional noise .",
    "moau tess are expected to have comparable performance and have already been demonstrated by a number of groups . here",
    "we explore moau tess fabricated on very thin silicon nitride ( @xmath2 ) suitable for ultra - low - noise detectors .",
    "these are the first measurements of moau tess fabricated by the detector physics group in cambridge .",
    "[ fig : experimental_pictures ]    the tess reported in this paper consisted of a superconducting moau bilayer formed on a 200  nm - thick @xmath0 island isolated from the heat bath by 4 , long , narrow nitride legs with widths of @xmath3 or @xmath4 and lengths ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "the tess were formed from a bilayer consisting of 40  nm of mo with 106  nm of au deposited under ultra - high vacuum by dc magnetron sputtering .",
    "in contrast to our earlier mocu tess a passivation layer to prevent corrosion of the exposed metal surface was not necessary .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] shows a photograph of one of the moau tess measured in this study .",
    "the released tes is almost completely flat and we estimate a curvature of order 100  nm into the plane of the figure due to slight stress in the nb wiring which had a transition temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this curvature is much reduced from that seen in our mocu tess on such thin nitride@xcite where the residual stress associated with the passivating @xmath1 determines the flatness .",

    "the flatness of the power plateaux down to @xmath33 are indicative of high values of the temperature - resistance coefficient @xmath34 and reflects the smoothness of the r(t ) transition .",
    "power dissipation as a function of @xmath32 for 15 tess on the chip was measured .",
    "the power - flow was modelled as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the joule power which was used to fit the measurements with @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 as free parameters .",

    "results are shown in table  1 .",
    "@xmath11 determined in this way agreed to within @xmath38 with observations of the onset of supercurrent .",
    "the mean value of the exponent is @xmath39 . for our higher-@xmath12 mocu tess",
    "we found @xmath40 using 500  nm thick @xmath2 for nitride widths down to @xmath41 , lengths in the range 40 to @xmath41 with @xmath11 in the range of 200 to 400  mk .",
    "for our ultra - low-@xmath12 tess on 200  nm thick nitride and @xmath42 we found @xmath9 in the range @xmath43 to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this change in @xmath9 as a function of nitride thickness and measurement temperature is characteristic of a change in dimensionality of the heat transport .",
    "normal state resistance @xmath46 was in the range @xmath47 for all of the tess measured here .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_c_variation ] shows the derived , apparent @xmath11 s of 15 tess on the measured chip plotted as a function of tes identification number .",
    "the variation in @xmath11 is greater than we measured in our earlier high-@xmath12 mocu tess ( which had @xmath49 ) , and shows a pattern of variation strikingly similar to that observed in our very low-@xmath12 mocu tess ( with @xmath50 ) , measured in the same cryostat and experimental set - up.@xcite the variation and pattern is independent of the chip position on the wafer .",
    "the spread of @xmath11 s ( @xmath51 ) is less than observed at the lower temperature .",
    "note how the tess in column  4 seem to show the greatest reduction in @xmath11 from the mean .",
    "previously we thought that the variation in @xmath11 might be due to low levels of stray light and estimated a loading of order 2 to 4  fw . in the inset of the figure we plot estimates of the stray light power @xmath52 as a function of the position of the tes in the array and we have assumed that the highest transition temperature @xmath53 is unaffected by stray light so that @xmath54 .",
    "strictly this means that @xmath52 is the differential loading .",
    "the pattern of stray light is suggestive of power incident on the far corner of the array ( i.e. row 4 and column 4 ) viewed from the perspective of the figure .",
    "[ fig : subfigureexample ]    the tes impedance @xmath55 , the current response to a small step change in the bias voltage @xmath56 and noise were measured for tes ( 1,4 ) as a function of bias .",
    "figure  [ fig : current_noise ] shows results with @xmath57 which gave the fastest observed risetime . a distributed thermal model to account for the expected heat capacities and conductances , including the @xmath0@xcite , was used .",
    "figure  [ fig : impedance_and_risetime ] shows both the measured risetime and ( inset ) the impedance and calculations with an additional heat capacity of @xmath58 coupled to the tes with @xmath59 .",
    "the excess is of unknown origin . for these calculations @xmath60 , and the temperature - current sensitivity @xmath61 .",
    "the account of both the risetimes and impedance is very good using identical parameter sets and as expected @xmath34 is large .",
    "figure  [ fig : current_noise ] shows measured and calculated current noise spectra . at frequencies above the read - out @xmath62 knee ,",
    "the measured spectrum is very - well accounted for by the same extended thermal model used to describe @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "the phonon noise modifier is here set to @xmath63 .",
    "this is an _ upper - limit _ on the noise modifier if the measurements are affected by stray light .",
    "calculation of the possible contribution to the noise from stray light is difficult since the spectrum , and the absorption and coupling efficiencies are not known .",
    "however , spectrally , noise from stray light would contribute to the current noise just as phonon noise .",
    "we have reported our first measurements on moau bilayer tess consisting of 40  nm mo , 106  nm au .",
    "conductances to the heat bath have been determined for 15 tess each having four support legs , with widths of @xmath3 or @xmath4 and lengths of @xmath5 to @xmath6 on 200  nm thick @xmath2 and are in the range 0.88 to @xmath64 . for all geometries",
    "the exponent in the power - flow is @xmath65 which is comparable with identical geometries measured at @xmath66 where we found @xmath67 .",
    "both values are lower than those found for thicker nitride films of comparable dimensions measured with transition temperatures between 200 and @xmath68 where we found @xmath69 .",
    "transition temperatures derived from measurements of the joule power were @xmath70 and normal state resistances @xmath47 .",
    "the variation in derived @xmath11 s show similar geometric patterns to earlier measurements on very low-@xmath12 tess measured in the same experimental arrangement",
    ". this observation may be consistent with the presence of very low levels of stray light despite the use of custom - designed light shielding , held at the cryostat base temperature , to avoid radiation from higher temperature sources .",
    "estimates of the levels of differential stray light give @xmath71 about a factor 4 higher than the earlier measurements .",
    "this emphasises the great care required when measuring low-@xmath12 structures and the strict requirements on stray - light control on an instrument .",
    "a good account of the dynamic behaviour is obtained using an extended thermal model for the tes with expected heat capacities and conductances plus a small additional heat capacity of unknown origin that is loosely coupled to the tes .",
    "the current noise is consistent with a phonon - noise modifier @xmath63 but this is an upper limit due to the possible influence of stray light . in future work",
    "we will iterate the au thickness to achieve the lower @xmath11 s required for ultra - low - noise operation and also will include the thin - film absorbing structures required to fabricate complete infrared detectors .",
