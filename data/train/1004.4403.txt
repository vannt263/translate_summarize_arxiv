    "one of the central issues currently under intense investigation in both nuclear physics and astrophysics is the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "for cold nuclear matter of isospin asymmetry @xmath0 at density @xmath1 , the energy per nucleon @xmath2 can be expressed as an even series of @xmath3 that respects the charge symmetry of strong interactions , namely , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the so - called symmetry energy of the _ _",
    "i__th order @xcite and @xmath6 is the eos of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath7 is most important and its value at normal nuclear matter density @xmath8 is known to be around 30 mev from analyzing nuclear masses within liquid - drop models .",
    "essentially , all microscopic many - body calculations have indicated that the higher - order terms are usually negligible around @xmath8 , leading to the so - called empirical parabolic law of eos even for @xmath3 approaching unity for pure neutron matter .",
    "the @xmath7 is then generally regarded as the symmetry energy .",
    "for instance , the value of the quartic term has been estimated to be less than 1 mev at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of higher - order terms at supra - saturation densities can significantly modify the proton fraction in neutron stars at @xmath9-equilibrium and thus the cooling mechanism of proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it was also found that a tiny quartic term can cause a big change in the calculated core - crust transition density in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , precise evaluations of the quartic symmetry energy in neutron - rich matter are useful .",
    "although much information about the eos of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath6 has been accumulated over the past four decades , our knowledge about the density dependence of @xmath5 is unfortunately still very poor .",
    "it has been generally recognized that the @xmath5 , especially the quadratic and quartic terms , is critical for understanding not only the structure of rare isotopes and the reaction mechanism of heavy - ion collisions , but also many interesting issues in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "therefore , to determine the @xmath5 in neutron - rich matter has recently become a major goal in both nuclear physics and astrophysics . while significant progress has been made recently in constraining the @xmath7 especially around and below the saturation density , see , e.g. , @xcite , much more work needs to be done to constrain more tightly the @xmath5 at supra - saturation densities where model predictions are rather diverse @xcite .",
    "as dedicated experiments using advanced new detectors have now been planned to investigate the high density behavior of @xmath7 at many radioactive beam facilities around the world , it has become an urgent task to investigate theoretically more deeply the fundamental origin of the extremely uncertain high density behavior of @xmath7 .",
    "it is also of great interest to evaluate possible corrections due to the @xmath10 term to the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter .    among existing proposals for extracting information about @xmath5 using terrestrial laboratory experiments ,",
    "transport model simulations have shown that many observables in heavy - ion reactions are particularly useful for studying @xmath5 in a broad density range . in these transport model simulations of heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "the eos enters the reaction dynamics and affects the final observables through the single - nucleon potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the nucleon momentum .",
    "except in situations where statistical equilibrium is established and thus many observables are directly related to the binding energy @xmath2 after correcting for finite - size effects , what is being directly probed in heavy - ion reactions is the single - nucleon potential @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is , however , directly related to the symmetry energy @xmath7 through the underlying nuclear effective interaction as first pointed out by brueckner , dabrowski and haensel @xcite using k - matrices within the brueckner theory .",
    "they showed that if one expands @xmath11 to the leading order in @xmath3 as in the well - known lane potential @xcite , i.e. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the nucleon isoscalar and isovector ( symmetry ) potentials , the quadratic symmetry energy is then @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the nucleon kinetic energy at the fermi momentum @xmath18 in symmetric nuclear matter of density @xmath1 .",
    "the above equation indicates that the symmetry energy @xmath7 depends only on the single - particle kinetic and potential energies at the fermi momentum @xmath19 .",
    "this is not surprising since the microscopic origin of the symmetry energy is the difference in the fermi surfaces of neutrons and protons .",
    "the first term @xmath20 is the trivial kinetic contribution due to the different fermi momenta of neutrons and protons ; the second term @xmath21 is due to the momentum dependence of the isoscalar potential and also the fact that neutrons and protons have different fermi momenta ; while the term @xmath22 is due to the explicit isospin dependence of the nuclear strong interaction . for the isoscalar potential @xmath14",
    ", reliable information about its density and momentum dependence has already been obtained from high energy heavy - ion collisions , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit there are still some rooms for further improvements , particularly at high momenta / densities . on the contrary ,",
    "the isovector potential @xmath15 is still not very well determined , especially at high densities and momenta , and has been identified as the key quantity responsible for the uncertain high density behavior of the symmetry energy as stressed in ref.@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we first show , using both the differential and integral formulations of the hugenholtz - van hove ( hvh ) theorem @xcite , that the relation in eq.([esym ] ) is valid in general .",
    "we then derive an expression for the quartic symmetry energy @xmath10 in terms of the single - nucleon potential by keeping higher - order terms in the expansion of both the eos and the single - nucleon potential . applying the hvh formalism to two model single - nucleon potentials , namely ,",
    "the bombaci - gale - bertsch - das gupta ( bgbd ) potential @xcite and a modified gogny momentum - dependent - interaction ( mdi)@xcite , which are among the most widely used ones in studying isospin physics based on transport model simulations of heavy - ion reactions @xcite , we examine the relative contributions from the kinetic and various potential terms to @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "we put the emphasis on identifying those terms that dominate the high density behaviors of @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we evaluate the relative importance of the @xmath10 term by studying the @xmath23 ratio as a function of density .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ symmetry ] ,",
    "based on the hvh theorem we derive general expressions for the higher - order symmetry energy terms @xmath7 and @xmath10 in terms of the single - nucleon isoscalar and isovector potentials . the derivation is carried out in section  [ hvh ] using the differential form of the hvh theorem by starting from the neutron and proton chemical potentials and in section  [ fermi ] using the integral form of the hvh theorem by starting from the total energy density of the system .",
    "numerical results and discussions for both the bgbd and mdi interactions are given in sections  [ bgbd ] and [ mdi ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we present two alternative approaches to derive expressions for the quadratic and quartic symmetry energy terms @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "both are based on the fermi gas model of interacting nucleons and satisfy the hvh theorem that was first derived in ref .",
    "there are , however , some technical differences between the two approaches in that a taylor - series expansion is made on the single - nucleon energy in one approach but on the total energy of the system in the other .",
    "the hugenholtz - van hove theorem @xcite describes a fundamental relation among the fermi energy @xmath24 , the average energy per particle @xmath25 and the pressure of the system @xmath26 at the absolute temperature of zero . for a one - component system , in terms of the energy density @xmath27",
    ", the general hvh theorem can be written as @xcite @xmath28 the above relation has been strictly proven to be valid for any interacting self - bound infinite fermi system . it does not depend upon the precise nature of the interaction . in the special case of nuclear matter at saturation density where the pressure @xmath26 vanishes ,",
    "the average energy per nucleon becomes equal to the fermi energy , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the general hvh theorem of eq.([hvh ] ) is valid at any arbitrary density as long as the temperature remains zero @xcite .",
    "in fact , a successful theory for nuclear matter is required not only to describe satisfactorily all saturation properties of nuclear matter but also to fulfill the general hvh theorem at any density . in the following , we use the general hvh theorem to derive the relation between the nuclear symmetry energy and the single - nucleon potential .    according to the hvh theorem , the chemical potentials of neutrons and protons in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter of energy density @xmath30 are",
