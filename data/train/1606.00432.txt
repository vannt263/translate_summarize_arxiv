    "more than twenty years since their discovery , hot - jupiter planets are still peculiar astrophysical objects , whose diversity , formation process(es ) and migration mechanism(s ) are not well understood .",
    "an accurate knowledge of their characteristics is mandatory to put precise constraints on theoretical models , many of which were proposed during the last three decades to explain them , and discriminate which best reproduce observations . in this context , transiting hot jupiters are the most interesting to consider for detailed follow - up observations since their main physical parameters ( mass , radius , equilibrium temperature , orbital eccentricity and obliquity , etc . )",
    "are fully measurable with various ` standard ' observational techniques .",
    "finding evidence of possible correlations between their properties and initial conditions can be useful for constructing a reasonable population of synthetic planets able to explain their formation and evolution .",
    "so far , the most convincing correlation is that between the stellar metallicity and the frequency of giant planets , which were mostly detected around metal - rich host stars @xcite , see fig.[fig : metallicity ] .",
    "besides having observational support , the idea that jupiter planets are much more common around metal - rich stars also follows naturally from the core - accretion theory of planet formation , because in such environments a massive core can form more quickly , before the dispersal of the gas disc , and then accrete gas from the disc @xcite .",
    "data taken on 2016/05/09 from the transiting extrasolar planet catalogue ( tepcat ; @xcite ) , which is available at http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk / jkt / tepcat/. the dashed vertical line refers to the threshold expected by the core - accretion theory @xcite . ]    moreover , transiting hot jupiters are particularly well - suited for studying the atmospheres of this class of exotic giant planets .",
    "indeed , since most of them are exceptionally bloated ( probably caused by the intense irradiation received from their parent stars , e.g.  @xcite ) , their relatively large sizes can give deep transits ( typically @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the transmission - spectroscopy technique has been widely used in recent years for probing the chemical composition at the day - night terminator of the atmosphere of these planets . in particular ,",
    "the most convincing results have been obtained from the space with the hubble and spitzer space telescopes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this framework",
    ", we have for the last eight years run a large observational program with an array of medium - class telescopes , located in both the northern and southern hemispheres , with the aim of characterising a large sample of the planetary systems known to host transiting hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "our program is based on high - quality photometric follow - up observations of complete transit events by means of the telescope - defocussing technique .",
    "importantly , all the datasets are reduced and analysed in a homogeneous way ; different approaches in data analysis can indeed produce inhomogeneous results , which are then not straightforward to compare .",
    "some of the telescopes that we are using are equipped with multi - band imaging cameras , which allows us to monitor transits simultaneously in different filters , enabling the possibility of probing the atmosphere of a transiting planet by measuring its transmission spectrum , similarly to transmission spectroscopy but with a lower spectral resolution .    in this work we present our results concerning the planetary system wasp-98 , discovered by @xcite within the superwasp survey @xcite .",
    "it hosts a low - density hot jupiter ( wasp-98b ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ; @xmath10k ) , orbiting its parent star with a period of @xmath11days .",
    "the star is of spectral type g7v , brightness @xmath12mag , mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that wasp-98a is a very metal poor star , @xmath2 } = -0.60 \\pm 0.19 $ ] , which is unusual for stars hosting hot jupiters ; another emblematic case is wasp-112b ( @xmath2 } = -0.64 \\pm 0.15 $ ] , @xcite ) . only very few planets in the core - accretion paradigm are expected to form at such low metallicities @xcite .",
    "these would have required a high surface density of solid material and , therefore , a high disk mass to compensate a low dust to gas ratio .",
    "alternatively , other planet formation paradigms , such as formation by gravitational instability in which planet frequency is independent of metallicity @xcite , may be able to explain the formation of these planets .",
    "however , @xcite stressed that their spectral analysis depended on spectra of a low signal - to - noise - ratio ( s / n ) and suggested to take higher s / n spectra for confirmation of such a low metallicity",
    ".    the low metallicity of wasp-98a encouraged us to make this planetary system a high - priority target for our photometric follow - up programme .",
    "indeed , this paper concerns observations of new transit events of the planet and a more accurate spectroscopic study of the parent star . thanks to new photometric and spectroscopic data collected at the mpg 2.2 m telescope , we revised the main physical properties of the system and probed the terminator of the atmosphere of wasp-98b .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : observ - data - reduct ] we describe the observations carried out and the data reduction process .",
    "section  [ sec : light - curve - analysis ] is devoted to the analysis of the photometric data and the refinement of the orbital ephemeris .",
    "the revision of the physical parameters of the planetary system is discussed in section  [ sec : physical - properties ] , while in section [ sec : radius - variation ] we present a novel study of the variation of the radius of wasp-98b with wavelength .",
    "the results of this work are summarised in section  [ sec : summary - conclusions ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]          we took advantage of the ability of the grond instrument , which provides simultaneous light curves at different colours , to investigate the possible variation of the planetary radius of wasp-98b , in terms of @xmath15 , with wavelength .",
    "following the approach of @xcite , we estimated the ratio of the radii in each of the four optical passband , fixing all the other photometric parameters to their best - fit values . in this way we obtained a set of @xmath16 values which are not affected by common sources of uncertainty and",
    "are directly comparable .",
    "they are reported in table[tab : k - bands ] . whilst we did not find any variation of the planetary radius among the @xmath17 , @xmath4 and @xmath18 bands within the experimental uncertainties , we did detect a significant variation between these and the @xmath3 bands .",
    "the variation is roughly @xmath19 pressure scale heights , where @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath21 the mean molecular weight . ] for @xmath4 versus @xmath3 , with a confidence level of roughly 6@xmath22 ( see fig.[fig : radiusvariation ] ) .",
    "we investigated the radius variation of wasp-98b by calculating reasonable synthetic transmission spectra and comparing them to the observed one .",
    "self - consistent modelling of one - dimensional atmospheric structures and spectra were produced by making use of the _ petitcode _ @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in @xcite , this code has recently been extended to also calculate transmission spectra , including rayleigh scattering , tio and vo opacities . here , we briefly report on new capabilities of the code , which will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper ( mollire et al .",
    ", in prep . ) :    * _ clouds : _ the code has been extended by a cloud module , for which the cloud model , as reported in @xcite , was used , including some minor changes partially to adapt it for the case of hot jupiters . for the high altitude ( low pressure )",
    "regions of the atmosphere , we introduced an eddy diffusion coefficient , which increases with decreasing pressure , as it has been found in general circulation model ( gcm ) simulations of hot jupiters .",
    "the pressure dependence of this contribution is approximately proportional to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "further , above the convective region , we used a power - law decrease of the convective eddy diffusion coefficient , starting with the coefficient derived from mixing length theory in the last convective layer .",
    "this simulates convective overshoot in the deep , high pressure regions of the atmosphere @xcite . we compared our results of the cloud mass density for self - luminous planets set up identically to those reported in @xcite , and found a very good agreement . to calculate the cloud opacities for homogeneous spheres ,",
    "we used cross - sections derived from mie theory , calculated using a dust opacity code developed for distributions of hollow spheres ( dhs ) opacities @xcite , which makes use of software reported in @xcite . at present , we include mgsio@xmath24 , mg@xmath25sio@xmath26 , fe , kcl and na@xmath25s clouds with the real and complex parts of the refractive indices taken from @xcite for mgsio@xmath24 and mg@xmath25sio@xmath26 , @xcite for fe , @xcite for kcl and @xcite for na@xmath25s . * _ scattering : _ in the previous version of the code the effect of scattering",
    "was only included as an extinction source when including rayleigh scattering during the computation of transmission spectra . to also include the effect of scattering of the clouds and molecules ( via molecular rayleigh scattering ) on the temperature structure of the atmosphere",
    ", we implemented isotropic scattering for both the stellar insolation and the planetary flux . in order to speed up convergence",
    ", we made use of locally accelerated lambda iteration ( ali , see * ? ? ? * ) and ng acceleration @xcite .",
    "* _ line cutoff : _ while our previous opacities were without any sub - lorentzian line cutoff , we now include an exponential decrease for all molecular and atomic lines , because this is a more realistic scenario .",
    "we use the measurements by @xcite for all molecules but co@xmath25 , and a fit to the co@xmath25 measurements of @xcite carried out by bruno bezard ( priv .",
    "comm . ) for co@xmath25 .",
    "note that the measurements by @xcite are made for ch@xmath26 broadened by h@xmath25 .",
    "due to the lack of measurements for other species we use the ch@xmath26 measurements for other species as well , except for co@xmath25 , for which dedicated measurements exist .",
    "we used our measured physical properties from table[tab : derived - params ] for calculating self - consistent atmospheric structures of wasp-98b .",
    "the stellar irradiation was calculated assuming a global average , i.e.  the flux received at the top of the atmosphere was a quarter of the flux at the substellar point . for the planet",
    "s enrichment we used the host star s metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath27 ) .",
    "we considered the following five cases :    1 .",
    "_ cloud - free case _ : clear atmosphere without tio and vo opacities .",
    "hazy case _ : clear atmosphere with the h@xmath25 rayleigh scattering opacity multiplied by 1000 to mimic a strong haze - like absorber .",
    "no tio and vo opacities .",
    "here we did not calculate a dedicated atmospheric @xmath28-@xmath29 structure , but instead used the structure derived from the clear case .",
    "cloudy case _ : cloudy atmosphere without tio and vo opacities .",
    "we considered mgsio@xmath24 , mg@xmath25sio@xmath26 , fe , kcl and na@xmath25s clouds and used a settling factor @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the cloud particle mass averaged ratio between the particle settling and the atmospheric convective mixing velocity .",
    "_ standard tio / vo case _ : clear atmosphere , including tio and vo opacities . 5 .",
    "_ suppressed ti / v condensation case _ : clear atmosphere , including tio and vo opacities and suppressing the condensation of ti and v.    a comparison of the grond data and the synthetic spectra can be seen in fig.[fig : radiusvariation ] .",
    "it is evident that the data are not well fit by the cloud - free , hazy or cloudy cases when tio and vo is neglected . by including tio / vo , in the standard case , no differences to the cloud - free case can be seen , because ti and v are condensed and therefore can not form tio and vo . only in the case",
    "in which we suppress the condensation of ti and v , in which gaseous tio and vo can form , do we attain a reasonable fit between the observations and data .",
    "this is a curious result which should not be taken at face value , however .",
    "the nominal thermochemical model clearly forbids the existence of gaseous tio and vo in an atmosphere such that of wasp-98b .",
    "an additional optical absorber seems to be required in this case .",
    "potential candidates could be metal hydrides such as cah , mgh , crh , tih and feh which have lower condensation temperatures but for which wasp-98b is right on the brink , and potentially too cold , to allow for these molecules existence in the gas phase ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , most of the metal hydrides listed above ( except for perhaps mgh ) have a spectral shape inconsistent with the grond data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "note that _ petitcode _ does currently not include metal hydride opacities and not all of the above mentioned metal hydrides are currently treated in its equilibrium chemistry network .",
    "moreover , in the standard cloud - free case the atmosphere is too cold to have appreciable amounts of mgh present .",
    "new measurements with higher spectral resolution are clearly needed to shed light on the nature of the optical absorber in the atmosphere of wasp-98b .",
    "in this work we have presented new high - quality , broad - band photometric observations of two transit events of the hot jupiter wasp-98b .",
    "the observations were performed with the grond imager , which permits the simultaneous collection of multi - colour light curves .",
    "we also obtained three spectra of the parent star with the feros spectrograph for confirmation of its spectral characteristics , as it was previously found to be unusually metal - poor for a planet host star @xcite .",
    "the new data were analysed , modelled and used to redetermine the orbital ephemeris and physical parameters of the planetary system .",
    "our results , shown in table[tab : derived - params ] , are more precise , but still consistent , when compared with those reported by @xcite . besides finding that both the star and the planet are slightly larger and more massive than was previously thought , we measured a lower metallicity of the star , @xmath32 against @xmath33 , which still makes this planetary system very unusual in the sample of known systems ( see fig.[fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "considering the strong correlation between the metallicity and giant - planet frequency , if wasp-98b was formed via the core - accretion mechanism , it should be a very rare specimen .",
    "an alternative formation mechanism , like disk instability , could be advocate for explaining the existence of wasp-98b .",
    "additionally , we used our new multi - band photometric observations to probe the atmosphere of wasp-98b .",
    "we found a planetary radius variation between the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 bands of @xmath34 at a high confidence level of @xmath35 .",
    "we have compared our observational results with several synthetic spectra obtained with the _ petitcode _ , considering five possible types of atmosphere . a reasonable fit between the observations and data",
    "was only accomplished for the quite unrealistic case in which we suppressed the condensation of ti and v. our findings point therefore towards the existence of a mysterious optical absorber that should play an important role in the chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere of wasp-98b .    .",
    "the grey points denote values taken from tepcat .",
    "their error bars have been suppressed for clarity .",
    "the wasp-98 planetary system is shown in red @xcite and green ( this work ) .",
    "the dashed vertical line refers to a possible threshold given by the core - accretion theory @xcite . ]",
    "this paper is based on observations collected with the mpg 2.2 m telescope located at the eso observatory in la silla , chile .",
    "operation of the mpg 2.2 m telescope is jointly performed by the max planck gesellschaft and the european southern observatory .",
