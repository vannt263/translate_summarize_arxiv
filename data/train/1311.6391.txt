    "in the vicinity of a critical point @xcite , various static @xcite and dynamic @xcite quantities exhibit power - law singularities .",
    "computer simulations played crucial role in the understanding of static critical phenomena @xcite . in dynamics , on the other hand , simulations are recent , particularly for fluid criticality . there",
    ", in addition to the finite - size effects , critical slowing down poses enormous difficulty .",
    "note that the slowest relaxation time , @xmath0 , diverges at criticality as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the linear dimension of the system and @xmath3 is a dynamic critical exponent .    for the computational study of critical dynamics using microscopic models , one carries out molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite simulations .",
    "typically one considers microcanonical ensemble ( constant n , v , e , which are respectively the number of particles , confining volume and energy ) where requirements of hydrodynamics are satisfied .",
    "however , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) , close to the critical point , overwhelmingly long simulation runs are required to avoid finite - size effects even at a moderate level . in such a situation , control of temperature ( @xmath4 ) in nve ensemble",
    "becomes problematic .",
    "this calls for study of fluid critical dynamics in canonical ( nvt ) ensemble where , instead of @xmath5 , @xmath4 is kept constant .",
    "note here that for the studies of static quantities , such long runs can be avoided by smart choice of ensembles .",
    "this liberty stems from the robust universality of static critical phenomena .",
    "various thermostats @xcite are used to maintain temperature in md simulations in nvt ensemble , e.g. , andersen thermostat ( at ) , langevin thermostat ( lt ) , nos - hoover thermostat ( nht ) , dissipative particle dynamics thermostat ( dpdt ) , etc .",
    "even though all the above mentioned thermostats control the temperature of the system well , only few are useful for calculation of transport properties .",
    "crucial tests of such usefulness of a thermostat lie in nontrivial phenomena like phase transition dynamics which is the objective of this paper .    in at @xcite ,",
    "the temperature is controlled via random assignments of velocities to a fraction of particles according to maxwell distribution , mimicking collisions of the particles with a heat bath . due to this stochastic nature like monte carlo ,",
    "at is not useful for the calculation of transport properties . with increasing collision frequency ,",
    "the transport coefficients deviate further and further from the desired value .",
    "this stochastic character is also true for lt .",
    "note that for md in nve ensemble , one solves the newton s equations of motion involving the inter - particle force .",
    "in nvt ensemble , based on the thermostat , additional rules are imposed . in case of lt ,",
    "an additional drag force proportional to the velocity is introduced , in addition to a random force , both coming from the background solvent particles . there , for @xmath6th particle one solves the equation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position , @xmath9 is the interparticle potential , @xmath10 is the time , @xmath11 the drag coefficient and @xmath12 is a gaussian noise with mean zero at a temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the noise correlation between two times @xmath10 and @xmath13 follows the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ lt2 ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the cartesian axes of space coordinates .",
    "due to their momentum conservation inability by construction , at and lt are used for equilibration purpose . nevertheless , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will present some results using these thermostats as well .",
    "but there exist number of thermostats that preserve hydrodynamics reasonably well , e.g. , nht , dpdt , etc .",
    ", though , to the best of our knowledge , they were never tested before against critical dynamics .",
    "also , the understanding is primarily restricted to single particle motion .    in dpdt @xcite , the dissipative force in eq .",
    "( [ lt1 ] ) is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the relative position and velocity between @xmath6 and @xmath20 particles with @xmath21 ; @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is a weight function equaling @xmath24 , the latter being connected to the random force as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are gaussian random numbers with @xmath27 . for the choice of @xmath23 or @xmath28",
    ", there is no fixed prescribed rule . in this work we use them to be unity for distance @xmath29 and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "this choice keeps the temperature at desired value better than other standard choices . from the property of random force and the expression of the dissipative force ,",
    "it is appreciable that dpdt will preserve local momentum , thus hydrodynamics .",
    "however , this thermostat has issues related to keeping the temperature constant . for the choice of the weight function mentioned above and @xmath31 , we obtained very reasonable temperature control in this work .",
    "note that for lt we used @xmath32 .    in nht @xcite , an additional degree of freedom @xmath33",
    "is introduced and one solves the equations @xcite",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath33 is a time dependent drag , @xmath38 is the momentum and @xmath39 is the coupling strength of the system with the thermostat .",
    "essentially , in this case , the simulation is done in microcanonical ensemble @xcite with modified hamiltonian that provides averages equivalent to those of canonical ensemble with original hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    ", we provide results for the utility of nht and dpdt with respect to the study of dynamic critical phenomena . despite its problems , which are corrected to varying degrees in more recent versions",
    "@xcite , nht still remained popular for the study of transport in nvt ensemble .",
    "of course , every hydrodynamic preserving thermostat has some disadvantage , e.g. , dpdt suffer from temperature control problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model .",
    "the results are presented in section iii .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section iv with a summary and discussion .",

    "we have introduced a cut - off and shifting of the potential to zero at @xmath45 .",
    "further , the discontinuity of force at @xmath46 was removed by adding a term @xmath47 .",
    "we work with a symmetric model by setting @xmath48 .",
    "phase diagram for this model was studied @xcite via a semi - grandcanonical monte carlo @xcite method . in this scheme , in addition to the standard particle displacement moves , one tries identity switches @xmath49 which are accepted or rejected according to standard metropolis criterion . for the identity",
    "moves it is necessary to include in the boltzmann factor @xcite the chemical potential difference between the two species .",
    "this difference , however , in our case , due to the symmetry of the model , is zero along coexistence and for @xmath50 composition above the critical temperature @xmath51 . in this ensemble , from the fluctuation of concentration @xmath52 being the number of particles of species @xmath53 ) , one obtains a probability distribution @xmath54 . below the critical temperature",
    ", @xmath54 should have a two peak structure , locations of the peaks providing the points along coexistence . at the critical temperature , the structure of distribution crosses over from double peak to a single peak one .",
    "but this critical temperature is system - size dependent that we will denote as @xmath55 , which , in the limit @xmath56 , will converge to the thermodynamic critical temperature , @xmath51 . in table",
    "i we list the values of @xmath55 for a few system sizes .",
    "the transport properties are studied via md simulation in nve as well as nvt ensembles , for the latter various temperature controlling methods , discussed in the previous section , were used .",
    "details of the calculation of transport properties will be provided in the next section .",
    "all our simulations were performed in three space dimensions with cubic boxes of linear dimension @xmath2 and periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "the equations of motion in md were solved by applying verlet velocity algorithm with integration time step @xmath57 .",
    "all results are presented after averaging over multiple initial configurations .    .",

    "for nvt ensemble we have included results from at , lt , nht and dpdt as temperature controller .",
    "as expected , at and lt do not provide results consistent with the nve one .",
    "however , the results from nht and dpdt are very much in agreement with the latter . for nht ,",
    "even though we have presented the result using only @xmath85 , we have done the calculations with values of @xmath86 upto @xmath87 and observed that the results are not very sensitive to the choice of the variable .",
    "the final values of the transport quantities are obtained from the flat portions of these time - dependent plots .",
    "the temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is rather far above @xmath51 . in the following we focus in the critical region .",
    "note that @xmath58 is expected to diverge at criticality as @xcite @xmath88 with @xmath89 . to verify the consistency of our simulation results with this number , we take the route of finite - size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "noting that at criticality @xmath90 scales with @xmath2 , for results obtained at @xmath55 , @xmath91 it was observed in previous computer simulation of this model @xcite that @xmath58 has reasonably strong background contribution @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath92 was estimated to be @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we will thus deal with the critical part @xmath94 only .",
    "so , when calculated at @xmath55s , a plot of @xmath95 vs @xmath2 will be consistent with a power - law with exponent @xmath96 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "note that we have shown results from nht , dpdt as well as from nve ensemble calculations .",
    "all of them are in very good agreement .",
    "this essentially demonstrates that nht and dpdt are good devices for the calculation of mutual diffusivity ( @xmath97 ) even for quantitative understanding of critical dynamics . here",
    "note that @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the concentration susceptibility that can be calculated from concentration fluctuation in monte carlo simulations .    having demonstrated the usefulness of nht and dpdt in calculation of diffusion constants (",
    "note here that in many previous works it was shown that these thermostats are good for the calculation of self diffusivity ) , we turn our attention to viscosities . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the time dependent integration of shear viscosity , using eq .",
    "( [ shear1 ] ) for nve , nht and dpdt .",
    "here we do not show the results obtained using at and lt which , we have already understood , are not appropriate for the study of transport properties .",
    "satisfactory agreement is achieved with the nve calculation for results from both the thermostats .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath59 has very weak critical divergence , one needs huge statistics to verify that .",
    "therefore we do not take up that task in this work .",
    "even though , so far it appears that the nht is a good tool to study dynamic critical phenomena , we have encountered difficulty in the calculation of bulk viscosity , for this value of the coupling constant .",
    "this is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] but for bulk viscosity . here , even though a very good agreement is obtained involving nve and dpdt , result for nht is in clear disagreement . for the latter probably one needs to choose the coupling constant @xmath86 very judicially . in this connection , a discussion on the improvement of nht",
    "is provided in the next section .",
    "we mention here that for the same system size , conclusion similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are drawn when calculations are performed at @xmath55 .",
    "in this paper we presented comparative results for transport properties in a binary fluid mixture obtained from molecular dynamics @xcite calculations in microcaonical as well as canonical ensembles .",
    "it appears that even at criticality the nos - hoover thermostat @xcite and dissipative particle dynamics provide results for diffusivities and shear viscosity that are in excellent agreement with the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "however , while the dissipative particle dynamics appears to work well for bulk viscosity as well , the nos - hoover thermostat fails for this purpose .",
    "the importance of the paper lies in the following fact . very close to the critical point , for big enough systems",
    ", one needs extended simulation runs . in that case , for runs in microcanonical ensemble , it becomes difficult to avoid drift in temperature .",
    "thus , calculation of transports in canonical ensemble may be of help .",
    "nos - hoover thermostat still being a very commonly used one for hydrodynamic purpose , despite criticisms , one needs to check its validity in situations as nontrivial as critical dynamics .",
    "a criticism about nos - hoover thermostat is that it is not galilean invariant @xcite .",
    "if there is external force , e.g. , drag , there is problem with momentum conservation .",
    "recently , such problem is being taken care of @xcite by introducing additional soft pair potential and relative velocities .    despite some deficiencies",
    ", even the basic nos - hoover thermostat appears to provide reasonable description of dynamics for a number of quantities as seen here . even for nonequilibrium dynamics",
    "we have observed @xcite recently that this thermostat produces expected results .",
