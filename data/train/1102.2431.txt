    "type ii supernovae ( sne ) are core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) whose spectra show the presence of hydrogen .",
    "they are sub - divided based on light curve evolution , and type iip sne show an extended plateau phase lasting @xmath3 70 - 110 days due to radiative cooling of the shock - heated hydrogen envelope as well as energy released from hydrogen recombination .",
    "this phase is then followed by a tail of linear decline in luminosity , due to the radioactive decay of @xmath1co , with the luminosity being constrained by the amount of ejected @xmath1ni @xcite .",
    "type iip sne make up almost 60@xmath4 of ccsne @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of this subclass are thought to be red supergiants ( rsg ) with masses between 8 - 25 m@xmath0 @xcite that steadily lose their atmospheres with winds of 10 - 15 km s@xmath5 .",
    "recently , a comprehensive analysis by @xcite did not find any evidence for progenitors above 17 m@xmath0 , which may indicate a disconnect between theory and observation since theoretical models of ccsne progenitors , such as those listed in @xcite , have estimated progenitor masses of up to 29 m@xmath0 . therefore the search is ongoing for detection of more massive progenitors .",
    "the study of the role of ccsne as major contributors to dust production in the universe has grown dramatically over the last few years .",
    "this is due to the discovery of high redshift galaxies containing massive amounts of dust .",
    "the origin of this dust is still under much contention , whether it be from quick , explosive processes such as from ccsne or from slow , quiescent processes such as from the atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "ccsne , which can quickly return their material back into the surrounding ism , are attractive potential producers of dust seen at high - z .",
    "up to 1 m@xmath0 of dust per sn would be needed to account for the dust seen at high - z according to the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "numerous comprehensive studies of nearby sne have been undertaken in order to estimate dust masses , but at the most only 10@xmath6 m@xmath0 of newly formed dust has been detected @xcite , with the average newly formed dust masses being 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath2 m@xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "low mass stars take much longer to evolve into the dust producing agb phase , and may not have had enough time to evolve to become major dust producers in galaxies less than 1 gyr old as they do in modern galaxies @xcite .",
    "although , recent papers by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest agb stars may be significant dust contributors as early as @xmath3150 - 500 myr .",
    "@xcite find that in six submillimeter galaxies with z @xmath8 4 , the dust content of three can be explained by agb stars , while the remaining three can only be explained by ccsne .",
    "dust formation in the ejecta of ccsne can be detected by certain observational signatures .",
    "these include a decrease in the optical luminosity due to dust grains absorbing the visible light , while at the same time creating an excess in the ir as the grains re - emit the light at longer wavelengths .",
    "lastly , the spectral lines may appear to be asymmetric and blue - shifted as the dust grains obscure the receding ( red ) side of the ejecta more so than the approaching ( blue ) side .",
    "all three of these signatures were seen for the first time in sn 1987a @xcite , then in sn 2003gd @xcite , and also sn 2004et @xcite .",
    "there have also been several ccsne in the past few years that have shown one or two of these indicators of dust formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although these signatures usually appear between 1 and 2 years after the explosion , there has recently been confirmation of dust forming much earlier ( less than 200 days ) in a few ccsne with circumstellar interaction .",
    "normal type ii rsg progenitors only lose about 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10 m@xmath0 yr@xmath5 @xcite , which is too tenuous to show any circumstellar medium ( csm ) interaction .",
    "the progenitors of type iin sne on the other hand lose orders of magnitude more material , 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath5 m@xmath0 yr@xmath5 @xcite , which result in narrow ( @xmath3 100 km s@xmath5 ) emission lines in their spectra due to ionization of the pre - existing csm which has been excited by the initial flash of the supernova .",
    "for example sn 1998s showed dust formation signatures between days 140 - 268 @xcite , and sn 2005ip appears to have formed dust both in the cds between day 75 - 150 and then again in the ejecta after day 750 @xcite .",
    "although not classified as type iin , the type ib / c sn 2006jc also formed dust in the cool dense shell ( cds ) created by the interaction of the ejecta and the csm between 50 - 75 days post - explosion @xcite and the type iip sn 2007od formed dust sometime between day 120 - 230 through the same mechanism @xcite .    in this paper , we follow the evolution of the type iip sn 2007it in the optical and ir from day 10 to day 944 .",

    "spectrum was most similar to sn 2007od and sn 1999em . given the quoted foreground reddening of @xmath16 = 0.39 from ned for sn 2007it , and the total reddening by 0.39 @xmath17 0.04 of sn 2007od @xcite and 0.31 @xmath17 0.16 for sn 1999em ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) we have estimated that the reddening of the host galaxy is relatively low , and adopt @xmath16 = 0.39 for the purpose of this paper .",
    "we also first attempted to use the narrow na i d absorption seen in the day 10 spectrum of sn 2007it to determine the foreground extinction .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the blended na i d lines was 1.6 @xmath17 0.1 , which corresponded to an a@xmath181.27 @xmath17 0.1 of the host galaxy .",
    "this value does not agree with the day 10 spectrum which indicated that the sn is not reddened by a high amount .",
    "discrepancies between reddening measured from na i ew and actual values are not unique . for example , @xcite found that for an na i ew of @xmath3 0.2  @xmath15 had values ranging between 0.2 and 1.5 , and that one could not solely rely on ew values .",

    "statistical uncertainties presented in the plot represent 1@xmath20 errors .",
    "the data have been corrected for foreground extinction .",
    "the photometric evolution of sn 2007it at early times seems to be consistent with other type iip supernova lightcurves , as can be seen in figure 3 .",
    "the plateau phase appears to begin near day 20 , and lasts until around the time that the sn becomes visible again on day 107 when it is in midst of its the post - plateau drop in brightness .",
    "therefore the plateau phase lasted @xmath3 80 days .",
    "given the distance to sn 2007it and the v magnitudes on day 20 and day 107 , the average absolute magnitude of sn 2007it on day @xmath350 is estimated to be m@xmath21=-16.7 ( l = 1.6 x 10@xmath22 erg s@xmath5 ) , once corrections for reddening have been made . comparing these values with other type iip sne (",
    "* and references therein ) indicates that sn 2007it is one of the more luminous , well studied type iip sne to date and is quite similar to sn 2004et ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "after the plateau phase , the drop to the radioactive tail is roughly 2 mag .",
    "type iip sn normally experience a decrease in luminosity of @xmath31.5 - 3 mag based upon the amount of @xmath1ni present . for comparison ,",
    "sn 2007it shows roughly the same plateau duration and drop as sn 2004et ( figure 3 ) , which may suggest a similar @xmath1ni mass .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the decline in luminosity then follows the @xmath1co decay closely ( see figure 2 ) , until the sn is lost behind the sun after day 339 .",
    "once sn 2007it was observed again on day 509 , we found that its brightness had fallen below the expected @xmath1co decay by @xmath3 0.5 mag in r. the r band contains the h@xmath23 and [ o i ] @xmath24 6300,6364   emission features , which are responsible for most of the flux at late times .",
    "the most likely cause for this decreased decline in brightness is new dust formation between days 339 and 509 .",
    "this is the time period during which dust typically condenses in the ejecta of sne .",
    "after this drop , the @xmath1co decay was maintained , indicating that little or no further dust formation occurred after day 509 .",
    "other dust indicators such as the simultaneous increase in the ir luminosity and red - wing attenuation of the [ o i ] lines , discussed below , indicate that this is indeed the case .    also of note",
    "is another deviation from the @xmath1co decay curve seen as a flattening of the lightcurve after day 700 .",
    "this was also seen in sn 2007od @xcite , sn 2003gd @xcite , and sn 2002hh @xcite , and is likely a light echo caused by dust reflecting light from the flash of the sn explosion , keeping the luminosity brighter than expected at late times .",
    "a comprehensive explanation of scattered light echoes is presented in @xcite .",
    "scattered light echoes are expected to become major contributors to the emission of sne around 8 - 9 mag below maximum @xcite , which is when we see the flattening of the sn 2007it lightcurve .",
    "analysis of this echo is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "subtraction of images of sn 2007it taken with hst / acs on day 922 and three epochs of wfc3 data ( to presented in another paper ) between days 857 and 1009 revealed a residual in the southwest corner roughly 4 pixels from the center of the sn corresponding to an echo from ism material @xmath321 pc away from the sn ( andrews et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "comparison of photometry from early times to the late - time flattening , show the late - time color is much bluer , with b - v dropping from @xmath31.5 on day 107 , to @xmath3 0.3 on day 922 .",
    "this will happen when the csm or ism dust is preferentially scattering the blue light as was seen in sn 2006gy on day 810 @xcite .",
    "the resolved light echo , along with the blue late - time colors , indicate that the flattening of the light curve after day 696 is likely due to a light echo and not csm interaction at late times .",
    "figure 4 shows the optical spectral evolution of sn 2007it from day 10 to day 922 .",
    "the early time spectra show broad h@xmath23 and h@xmath25 emission and strong na i d absorption .",
    "the h@xmath23 evolution is seen in figure 5 , and shows a blueshift for at least the first 200 days .",
    "blueshifted h@xmath23 emission has been seen in other type ii sne such as sn 1988a @xcite , sn 1998a @xcite , and sn 1999em @xcite . @xcite and later @xcite proposed that this was caused by the reflection of photons by the photosphere . for 1988a and 1999em ,",
    "the blueshift only lasted @xmath380 days , whereas sn 2007it and sn 1998a seem to have a blueshift persisting well past 150 days . by day 200 , when the sn is well into the nebular phase , strong [ o i ] @xmath24 6300,6363    emission is seen ( shown in figure 5 ) , as well as [ ca ii ] @xmath247291,7324 and [ fe ii ] @xmath267155    emission .",
    "once we recover sn 2007it at day 509 , the [ o i ] line strengths rival that of h@xmath23 , while the [ ca ii ] lines are at most , half the strength of h@xmath23 .",
    "this is unusual for type iip sne , since most exhibit stronger [ ca ii ] than [ o i ] .",
    "the only other example of a type ii sn with similar late - time line strengths as sn 2007it , was the type iil sn 1970 g .",
    "unfortunately no optical spectra were taken after @xmath3 day 350 of sn 1970 g to allow further comparisons of the spectral evolution .",
    "there is also an emission feature emerging after day 200 at 7380  which is separate from the [ ca ii]/[o ii ] blended lines , and could be a [ ni ii ] @xmath267380   line which was also identified in the type iin sn 2006gy @xcite , type ic sn 2006aj @xcite , and a few type ia sne @xcite",
    ". this line may be present in other sne but hidden by strong [ ca ii ] emission @xcite .    of special note",
    "are the multi - component peaks of the [ o i ] @xmath276300,6364   lines that are visible in our day 154 spectra and persist to day 622 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "these emission line profiles are similar to the multiple peaks seen in the h@xmath23 emission of sne 1998s @xcite and 2007od @xcite .",
    "both the 6300 and 6364   lines have a blue - shifted component occurring at -1300 km s@xmath5 in relation to the component seen at the rest velocity of the galaxy .",
    "there seems to be no corresponding red peaks at + 1300 km s@xmath5 .",
    "because csm interaction is normally only seen in h and he lines , this suggests another origin for the multiple peaks .",
    "similar asymmetries in the [ o i ] lines have been seen in numerous h - poor ccsne ( type ib , ic , and iib ) , for example sne 2005aj , 2006 t , and 2008ax , but seems to be rare in normal type iip @xcite .",
    "these asymmetries can be seen approximately 2 months post explosion in h - poor ccsne , but due to the lack of spectral observations between days 10 and 154 in sn 2007it , we can not pinpoint the exact date before day 154 when the [ o i ] lines and the corresponding asymmetries appeared .",
    "@xcite suggest that the the absence of a red component combined with the presence of blue peak the same distance away from both the 6300   and 6364   lines could be explained by emission from an asymmetric blob of o material ejected on the forward side of the sn during the explosion .",
    "they do caution that a torus of o material is less likely but can not be ruled out , and that the red - shifted components could exist but are hidden either by the sn orientation or obscuring dust .",
    "the existence of fast moving knots seen in oxygen - rich sn remnants such as puppis a and cas a may substantiate the asymmetric blob scenario . according to @xcite ,",
    "it is likely that these knots are intact fragments of the core of the progenitor star .",
    "these remnant oxygen knots have radial velocities consistent with the blue [ o i ] components of sn 2007it .",
    "signatures of csm interaction can also be seen in the h@xmath23 and [ o i ] lines ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the csm interaction is manifested as a narrower feature ( fwhm @xmath3 1000 km s@xmath5 ) at the rest velocity rising above the broader ( fwhm @xmath34000 km s@xmath5 ) ejecta base .",
    "although this feature does not become apparent until day 509 in the h@xmath23 spectra , it seems to be present since day 154 in the [ o i ] emission .",
    "we then surmise that the intermediate peak was present in both lines since day 154 , but the overwhelming ejecta emission in h@xmath23 kept it hidden until day 509 . from the day 154 spectra and onward in [ o i ] there also seems to be an attenuation of the red - wing of the central peak , especially in 6300   which becomes even more apparent after day 509 when the asymmetric blob emission has faded .",
    "there are two possibilities for these asymmetries , attenuation from pre - existing dust or bochum events like that seen in h@xmath23 of sne 1987a and 1999em . for a full discussion on these events",
    "see @xcite . the shape of the [ o i ] central peaks are similar to modeled profiles presented in @xcite , where the peak has been shifted toward the blue side due to the presence of dust in the ejecta . as we will show below , ir data from day 351 suggests the presence of an ir echo from flash - heated pre - existing dust .",
    "this pre - existing dust is likely the cause of the attenuation seen in the [ o i ] lines .",
    "we do not see signatures of new dust forming from asymmetries in the spectral lines , although we must point out that it is possible that if the new dust is concentrated in a ring or torus around the sn , newly formed dust could be hidden by the viewing angle .",
    "if the newly formed dust has formed in the cool dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks formed in the csm interaction , the ejecta emission would be located interior to the newly formed dust , which would allow equal attenuation of the blue and red emission .",
    "we estimate a @xmath1ni mass for sn 2007it of m@xmath28= 0.09@xmath29 m@xmath0 from the methods of @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the radioactive tail ( in erg s@xmath5 ) is calculated as @xmath30 + 5log_{10}d-8.14}{2.5},\\ ] ] with a@xmath21 = 0.39 mag , and a bolometric correction of bc = 0.26 .",

    "we have estimated the mass of oxygen two separate ways using the strength of the [ o i ] doublet in the nebular phase before the onset of dust formation .",

    "once again we used an oxygen flux of 9.7 x 10@xmath35 erg s@xmath5 cm@xmath6 .",
    "this calculation gives us an oxygen mass of 0.96 that of sn 1987a , or between 1.15 - 1.44 m@xmath0 .",
    "these values , although not consistent with each other , are very similar to the values calculated for sn 2004et in @xcite .    comparing the relationship between @xmath1ni and progenitor mass in other sne ( for example , table 5 in @xcite ) , it is likely that sn 2007it had a main sequence mass @xmath42 20 m@xmath0 .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that using the velocity of the h@xmath23 line at @xmath3 day 15 and the velocity of the [ o i ] @xmath24 6300,6363   lines at @xmath3 300 days could be an indicator of progenitor zams mass . using the values of 10960 km s@xmath5 and 2000 km s@xmath5 , respectively , and the estimated mass of oxygen from above suggests a progenitor mass between 16 - 20 m@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite have also suggested that the ratio between [ ca ii]/[o i ] lines in the nebular phase can be an indicator of progenitor mass , with smaller ratios belonging to higher mass progenitors .",
    "this ratio is 0.7 for sn 2007it between days 209 - 351 , which is quite small for a type iip sn",
    ". showed that sn with ratios similar to sn 2007it are normally of type ib / c .",
    "sn 1987a had a ratio of @xmath3 3 from day 250 - 450 and sn 2005cs meanwhile showed a ratio of 4.2 @xmath170.6 on day 334 @xcite , which is 40@xmath4 larger than sn 1987a , and over 6 times greater than sn 2007it .",
    "this may indicate that the progenitor of sn 2007it may have been more massive than either sn 2005cs ( 7 - 13 m@xmath0 ) and sn 1987a ( 14 - 20 m@xmath0 ) , with roughly a mass of 20 - 27 m@xmath0 .",
    "even though each method yields different dust masses , and uncertainties in distance and reddening may add more ambiguity to these estimates , they all suggest that sn 2007it had a progenitor mass of @xmath3 20@xmath43m@xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , no images of the progenitor star exist , although as was shown in the case for sn 2004et , masses from progenitor images do not necessarily always agree with other estimates from explosion parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therin ) .",
    "sn 2007it was monitored in the mid - ir for four epochs spanning days 351- 944 ( see table 5 ) . as can be seen in figure 7",
    ", the first epoch on day 351 shows an indication of an increased flux in the 4.5 @xmath19 m band with respect to the other channels . this elevated emission in this band photometry",
    "was also seen around the same time period in sne 2005af @xcite , 2004dj @xcite and 2004et @xcite , and has been attributed to co fundamental band emission .",
    "less prominent is the possible extra emission at 8.0 @xmath19 m which may be due to sio emission .",
    "sio emission was discovered in 1987a @xcite and also in sn 2004et @xcite , and 2005af @xcite .",
    "co and sio are thought to be precursors to dust formation @xcite since they likely provide the molecular foundation from which the dust grains form .",
    "therefore the presence of these molecules is important in understanding the whole story of dust formation in sne .",
    "day 351 shows the presence of an ir excess , well before the estimated time of new dust formation as indicated by visible photometry . a likely cause for this elevated flux is an ir echo from flash - heated pre - existing csm dust .",
    "comparison with the models of sn 1980k presented in @xcite , which also had a peak luminosity of @xmath3 10@xmath44 l@xmath0 , indicates a dust free cavity extending to 3 x 10@xmath45 cm with a shell of material extending up to or past 6.3 x 10@xmath45 cm .",
    "this corresponds to a plateau of luminosity lasting from day @xmath3 200 up to day 643 , depending on the model .",
    "we do not have any ir observations prior to day 351 , so we can not definitively suggest the early behavior , but it is likely that an ir excess was present early on and we are seeing the continued plateau of this heated dust on day 351 , similar to that seen in sn 1980k . if , though , we use the optical spectra on day 339 before the csm interaction is apparent in h@xmath23 and day 540 when the intermediate peak is visible along with the ejecta velocity on day 10 of 10 960 km s@xmath5 @xcite , we estimate that the initial sn flash has cleared a dust - free cavity between 3.2 and 5.3 x 10@xmath46 cm from the center .",
    "this agrees with estimates for sn 2005ip , which has the same l@xmath47 10@xmath44 l@xmath0 , and a vaporization radius of @xmath3 10@xmath46 cm @xcite . assuming a cavity was cleared out to 4 x 10@xmath46 cm",
    ", the optical and uv light would reach this boundary at around 15 days and the time , @xmath48 for the ir plateau to last would only be @xmath49 , or @xmath3 31 days .",
    "although we can not definitively explain the discrepancy between spectral constraints and sn 1980k model comparisons , it is possible that where @xcite considers a single , very thin shell of csm material , sn 2007it may have a much more extended shell or multiple shells , creating a much later and/or longer plateau .",
    "the ir fluxes on day 561 are very different from day 351 , most importantly the fluxes in the 3.6 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath19 m channels have doubled in intensity .",
    "this may indicate that new dust grains have formed .",
    "this is likely since this is the same time period in which we see a dimming in the visible lightcurve ( between days 339 and 540 ) .",
    "the combination of the elevated mid - ir flux at the same time as the corresponding dimming in the visible can be explained if dust grains are absorbing the high energy photons and re - emitting them in the ir .",
    "this has been seen in other dust producing ccsne such as sn 1987a @xcite and sn 2003gd @xcite .",
    "modified blackbody fits to this epoch indicate a blackbody luminosity of 4.5 x 10@xmath50 erg s@xmath5 , twice the blackbody luminosity at day 351 .",
    "this is consistent with the optical drop of 0.5 mag between the two epochs which causes the early time luminosity to be 1.58 times brighter , or almost twice the brightness of the luminosity on day 540 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the drop in optical luminosity is equal to the increase in ir luminosity .",
    "days 718 and 922 were both observed by spitzer in warm mode , so only the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath19 m bands were available .",
    "both epochs show significant ir luminosity , likely due to the newly formed ejecta dust . in the day 922 data , the 4.5 @xmath19 m flux appears to be stronger than expected , and in fact the ratio between 3.6 and 4.5 is much smaller than other epochs , only 0.27 as opposed to 0.6 on day 718 .",
    "if we assume the ratio to be constant in the day 922 epoch , we would expect a flux of @xmath3 66 @xmath19jy , but instead see a flux of 143 @xmath19jy , indicating that there is possibly an excess in the 4.5 @xmath19 m channel .",
    "this is also seen by sugerman et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) for sn 2004et .",
    "it is likely we are still seeing co emission that was visible on day 351 , which was hidden by the increased emission from the new dust on day 561 , and became visible again in the later epochs as the grains cooled .",
    "in order to quantify the amount and composition of the dust in sn 2007it we used our 3d monte carlo radiative transfer code mocassin ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . we have chosen to model three different geometries in which the dust is distributed either uniformly within a spherical shell surrounding the sn , with the addition of clumps scattered throughout the shell , or in a torus at some inclination around the sn . these will be known as `` smooth '' , `` clumpy '' , and `` torus '' models , respectively . relying on previous modeling done by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "we have used a standard mrn grain size distribution of @xmath51 between 0.005 and 0.05 @xmath19 m @xcite for all three scenarios .",
    "tables 6 and 7 , and figure 7 show the model results .    as we assumed for sn 2007od @xcite , in these models the dust and luminosity for the source was located between inner radius r@xmath52 and outer radius r@xmath53 of a spherically expanding shell , with the luminosity being proportional to the density at each location . for day 351",
    "we have chosen to concentrate the luminosity in a point source , rather than spread throughout the shell , as it is likely this emission is the result of flash - heated pre - existing csm .",
    "this does create a better fit to the ir data points .",
    "the smooth model assumes the density of dust in the shell was inversely proportional to the square of the radius . for the clumpy model",
    "the photons originate in the inhomogeneous interclump medium , where the clumps are considered to be optically thick and spherical . for the torus models ,",
    "densities are specified for the inner and outer walls , with the dust distribution falling off linearly between the two radii @xcite .    for each model we used a combination of amorphous carbon ( ac ) and silicate grains , using the optical constants of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "for all epochs the best fit occurred with a carbon rich combination of 75@xmath4 ac and 25@xmath4 silicates , as was also the case in sn 2007od @xcite . for day 351",
    "no attempt was made to fit the 4.5 @xmath19 m point , since it was likely due mainly to co emission , the same is true for day 922 when co may also be responsible for the elevated 4.5 @xmath19 m flux .",
    "luminosity , ejecta temperature , inner and outer radii , and dust masses were all inputs for each model .",
    "initial estimates for each parameter were accomplished using black body fits to the optical and ir data .",
    "this yielded dust temperatures ( t@xmath54 ) of roughly 500 k for the first epoch , and 700k for day 561 , 590 k for day 718 and 480 k for day 944 .",
    "these temperatures are consistent with typical warm dust temperatures . for our first epoch",
    ", we used an r@xmath52 of 3.2 x 10@xmath46 cm , which roughly corresponds to the evaporation radius of the initial flash of the sn .",
    "all other epochs used an r@xmath52 of 7 x 10@xmath55 cm which created the best fits .",
    "we also kept the temperature of the ejecta ( t@xmath56 ) at 5700k for all epochs , since this is a reasonable ejecta temperature and does an adequate job fitting the first epoch of optical points .",
    "the combination of high h@xmath23 flux and [ o i ] emission lines in the r band relative to the continuum , and at later times additional flux due to the light echo has made it unlikely that the visible photometry is consistent with any reasonable blackbody temperature . keeping those two values constant",
    ", we then varied the luminosity , outer radii , and dust masses to get the most accurate fits .",
    "for all epochs we found that the clumpy distribution predicted on average slightly higher dust masses than the smooth and torus models .    we estimate a dust mass for our first epoch of 5 x 10@xmath57 for the smooth model , 7.3 x 10@xmath57 for clumpy , and 1.6 x 10@xmath57 for the torus .",
    "the remaining epochs yielded smooth dust masses of 7.0 x 10@xmath58 for day 561 , 8.0 x 10@xmath58 for day 718 , and 4.6 x 10@xmath58 for day 922 .",
    "the larger dust mass from the first epoch might be explained by the flash heating of pre - exisiting csm dust in an area much further away and roughly 200k cooler than following epochs . at this first epoch r@xmath52 = 3.2 x 10@xmath46 cm , which is larger than the r@xmath53 of the remaining epochs .",
    "this pre - existing dust will cool , as described in section 5 above , and fade after its initial heating by the sn flash so that by day 561 the ir sed is dominated by newly formed ejecta dust .",
    "after day 561 , r@xmath52 = 7 x 10@xmath55 and r@xmath53 = 2 x 10@xmath46 , which likely places the dust at this time in the cds interior to the point of csm interaction .",
    "these results also indicate that the amount of new dust created is smaller than the amount in the csm .    on day",
    "351,the mocassin models estimate that @xmath59 = 0.08 . in order to independently estimate the optical depth",
    ", we used the methods of @xcite which uses total peak energy and ir energy(@xmath60 ) .",
    "the peak luminosity of sn 2007it was @xmath3 10@xmath44 l@xmath0 , which would indicate e @xmath3 10@xmath61 erg using the estimates of sn 2005ip contained in @xcite .",
    "the ir energy for the first 351 days is then 1 x 10@xmath62 erg , using an l@xmath63 of 8.8 x 10@xmath64 l@xmath0 .",
    "this yields a @xmath65 = 0.09 , consistent with our mocassin fits . between day 351 and 561",
    "we also find a significant increase in @xmath66 , which jumps from 0.08 to 1.27 as the new dust forms .",
    "this is largely due to the order of magnitude decrease in r@xmath53 between the two epochs , requiring similar amounts of dust in a much smaller volume .",
    "although the optical light curve suggests only an a@xmath21 = 0.5 , considerations of geometry , such as the newly formed dust existing in a torus around the sn for which we are seeing inclined at an angle away from edge - on , could explain the higher amount estimated from moccasin which would provide the total optical depth summed over the whole system , not just along our line of sight .",
    "this scenario could also explain the lack of increased attenuation in the [ o i ] and h@xmath23 spectral lines between days 339 and 540 when we see the other dust formation signatures , mainly the simultaneous increase in optical extinction and ir luminosity .",
    "therefore the total mass of new dust formed in sn 2007it appears to be @xmath3 1.0 x 10@xmath57 , which although consistent with dust masses of other ccsne , is still considerably smaller than the amount needed to account for the dust seen at high - z @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the results of a comprehensive study of sn 2007it for almost three years post - explosion .",
    "sn 2007it is a type iip supernova , most similar to sn 2004et , that shows some interesting characteristics and has produced @xmath3 1.0 x 10@xmath57 of dust in its ejecta , likely in the cool dense shell created from csm interaction .",
    "high late - time luminosities indicate that m@xmath28= 0.09 m@xmath0 was synthesized in the explosion , greater than seen in other sne such as 1987a and 2004et .",
    "the [ ca ii]/[o i ] ratios post plateau are also much smaller than normally seen in a type iip , 0.70 prior to dust formation and 0.50 after .",
    "these two factors , a higher than normal ni mass and a small [ ca ii]/[o i ] , along with the expansion velocity of h@xmath23 at early times and of [ o i ] at later times suggest that sn 2007it may have had a progenitor mass @xmath42 20m@xmath0 , which is quite large for a type iip sn .",
    "the late - time lightcurve and color evolution also suggests that a light echo exists around sn 2007it which will be discussed in detail in an upcoming paper .",
    "estimates of oxygen mass suggest that 1.1 - 1.4 m@xmath0 may be present , which is consistent with the type ii sne 2004et and 1987a .",
    "the oxygen lines also show strange behavior not previously seen in a type ii sne . the post - plateau spectra show a blueshifted component at -1300 km s@xmath5 to both the 6300 and 6364   lines , with no corresponding peak at + 1300 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is likely due to emission from a torus of oxygen rich material surrounding the sn or an asymmetric blob of o material ejected on the forward side of the sn during the explosion .",
    "modeling done on sn 2007it using our moccasin radiative transfer code indicates that there was pre - existing dust surrounding the sn prior to explosion , and that up to @xmath3 1.0 x 10@xmath57 formed in the ejecta after day 351 . up to 1 m@xmath0 of dust",
    "would need to be produced per sn to account for the dust amounts seen at high - z according to the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , however , @xcite have suggested that these models may overestimate these masses , which would be consistent with the values seen in nearby sne .",
    "even if the amount of dust produced in sn 2007it may not be large enough to account for the dust budget of early galaxies @xcite , it is on par with other sne such as 2007od @xcite , 2004et @xcite , and sn 2006jc @xcite .",
    "although the sample is still small , this ever - growing body of evidence seems to indicate that low - mass ccsne such as the ones seen today are likely not major contributors to dust in the early universe .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite have both suggested that agb stars can be more significant contributors to dust formation in early galaxies than once thought and @xcite found that sn 2008s was likely a massive agb star , not a supernova at all , which produced a significant amount of dust .",
    "sne may then only play a small part in the dust formation in early galaxies , but more long - term and comprehensive observations of sne are needed to definitely answer the role of sne as dust produces in high - z galaxies .",
