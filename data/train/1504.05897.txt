    "@xcite showed similar slope variations from 0.9 to 1.4 by analyzing a large number of data from the literature .",
    "it is thus questionable that a single power - law relation exists between co(10 ) and fir and whether it can be applied to all galaxies even if it exists .",
    "co(10 ) has a low critical density ( @xmath21 ) , and thus traces the total amount of molecular gas .",
    "it provides no physical insight into the higher density gas ( @xmath22 ) that is known to be found at the formation sites of individual stars @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the co @xmath23 transition to denser / warmer gas increases with an increasing upper level ( @xmath24 ) : for example , co(10 - 9 ) has a critical density of @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "studies based on hcn @xcite and high-_j _ cs @xcite have found a unified linear correlation between dense gas and the sfr , describing the scenario in which all dense gas above a certain density threshold has a similar efficiency / timescale to collapse and form new stars , thus is linearly determining sfrs .    until recently , published mid - to - high-_j _ ( @xmath27 ) co data in local galaxies were still scarce due to the challenges of observing at frequencies @xmath28 from the ground .",
    "@xcite performed large velocity gradient ( lvg ) modeling with ground - based @xmath29 co to extrapolate @xmath30 transitions for several local galaxies .",

    "* ) for galaxies partially resolved by the fts beam ( see section [ section21 ] ) was imposed to enable beam - matching techniques to be used in the analysis .",
    "the final sample contains 167 local galaxies ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , including 124 ( u)lirgs and 43 sfgs ( see @xcite and @xcite for details of the hercules and goals programs , respectively ; details of the full data set are given in liu et al . in preparation ) .",
    "fts has two bolometer arrays : the slw bolometer array ( @xmath39 ) and the ssw bolometer array : ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "the central bolometer of each array is coaligned with the target , while off - axis bolometers point to the off - center sky .",
    "mapping observations perform jiggling to scan extended targets , and each individual bolometer will produce one spectrum at its own pointing ( r.a . , decl . ) .",

    "we note that measured line fluxes for the two sets of the @xmath43 single - pointing data show little difference ( @xmath44 ) . for single - pointing data",
    ", we use central bolometers to extract co lines . for mapping data ,",
    "which are usually for spatially - extended galaxies , we select individual bolometers that are @xmath45half - beam - separated ( nyquist sampling ) to extract co lines .",
    "note that fts covers a wide range of frequencies , and its beam size varies accordingly : @xmath46 at co(43 ) to @xmath47 at co(1312 ) , and is not a simple function of frequency .",
    "the beam size variation is well - calibrated for each central bolometer , but unavailable for off - axis bolometers .",
    "thus we assign an additional 15% uncertainty for off - axis bolometers .",
    "to derive co line flux , we use two different line profile fitting functions in hipe : a sinc and a sinc - convolved - gaussian ( scg ) .",
    "a scg , where a gaussian line profile is convolved with the sinc instrument response , is appropriate for observations of sources with broad / resolved lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : in such cases a sinc fit would underestimate the line flux by @xmath48 . in the more common case where the co line is not obviously resolved ,",
    "the scg - derived fluxes are systematically larger by @xmath49 . given that a large fraction of single - pointing data have broad / resolved lines while mapping data do not , here we use scg and sinc for single - pointing and mapping data , respectively , although we note that using only scg or sinc for all data has no significant change to our correlation results .",
    "the co flux uncertainties are derived from the rms in the baseline - subtracted spectra in the vicinity of each co line rather than from formal line fitting uncertainties . then the fluxes are converted to @xmath4 according to @xcite .      as a starting point we took the entire - galaxy fir luminosity ( @xmath50 ) from @xcite .",
    "given the mismatch between the dramatically varying fts co beam sizes and the physical extent of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "pacs bands span the peak of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of typical fir - luminous local galaxies , and thus provide a good proxy for fir and are insensitive to dust temperatures ( @xmath51 ) .. @xmath52 , where @xmath53 for typical local sfgs .",
    "] by performing photometry with an aperture of co beam size ( @xmath54 ) and an aperture of entire - galaxy ( @xmath55 ) , respectively , we can determine the fir luminosity that is appropriate to each co beam size : @xmath56 . in this way",

    "this is essential for local galaxies that are partially resolved for fts co beam sizes .",
    "fig.[fig01 ] shows the 9 co ",
    "fir correlations of local galaxies and spatially resolved regions of nearby galaxies . fts can observe co(43 ) to co(1312 ) except for galaxies at @xmath58 ( mostly ( u)lirgs ) whose co(43 ) shift out of the fts slw waveband .",
    "moreover , detections of co(1312 ) are sparse , and thus are not analyzed here .",
    "to derive the slope and intercept , we fit all data points ( excluding upper limits ) with two linear fitting codes : an idl least - squares fitting code based on mpfit @xcite , and an idl bayesian regression code linmix_err @xcite .",
    "the two methods give consistent results , thus we only show the latter results in fig.[fig01 ] .",
    "co(43 ) has the largest number of detections , but the least dispersions are seen in the co(65 ) and co(76 ) panels ( both with @xmath59 ) .",

    ", we find no evidence of significant decrease in slopes with increasing @xmath24 : @xmath611.01.1 at @xmath62 , and 0.961.0 at @xmath63 . besides , the fittings are consistent with the average distribution of upper limits for non - detections in each transition .",
    "@xcite analyzed the ir beam corrections based on 850@xmath64 images and found correction factors similar to ours for galaxies we had in common .",
    "they found that ir beam corrections have only minor effects on the slopes ( @xmath65 ) and thus did not apply them , while in contrast we found that slopes without ir beam corrections are smaller by 1015% .",
