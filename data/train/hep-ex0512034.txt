    "upper limits on the branching fractions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 decays have been set by the cleo experiment  @xcite .",
    "similar decay modes of the charmonium state @xmath24 , which has a mass above the @xmath25 production threshold have been observed recently  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the first evidence for the decay mode @xmath22 from the belle experiment .",
    "in this study 398 fb@xmath1 of data collected by the belle detector  @xcite on the @xmath15 resonance and in the nearby continuum is used .",
    "well reconstructed charged particles and photons are used to reconstruct the decay @xmath22 with the subsequent leptonic decay @xmath26 .    several selection criteria for charged tracks and neutral particles in an event were applied .",
    "charged particle candidates were required to satisfy the following requirements :    * transverse momentum , @xmath2730 mev/@xmath28 ; * impact parameter transverse to the beam , @xmath293 cm ; * impact parameter along the beam axis , @xmath304 cm ; * tracks that are not identified as a decay product of a reconstructed secondary v@xmath31 .",
    "charged particles are identified by combining responses from the cdc , tof and acc subdetectors of belle  @xcite into a likelihood @xmath32@xmath33  @xcite where @xmath34 indicates the particle type ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",

    "in addition , these electromagnetic clusters must have energies greater than 50  mev and not satisfy the @xmath47 hypothesis when combined with another photon in the event .    two electromagnetic showers with an invariant mass @xmath488 mev/@xmath11 ( where @xmath49 is the nominal @xmath47 mass ) form a @xmath50 if the confidence level for their kinematic fit to the @xmath50 hypothesis is greater than 0.1 and if their reconstructed momentum is greater than 100  mev/@xmath28 .",
    "hadronic events are selected by the standard belle hadronic selection .",
    "the most important of these selection criteria are the following : multiplicity of charged tracks in an event @xmath513 ; the electromagnetic calorimeter cluster multiplicity @xmath521 ; the event s visible energy @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a center of mass energy ; the energy sum of good cluster energies in the electromagnetic calorimeter must satisfy 0.18@xmath550.8 ; the sum of the @xmath56 components of each charged track s and photon s momenta is required to satisfy @xmath57 .",

    "60% of the events in the @xmath61 spectrum come from identified @xmath62 pairs .",
    "the absence of @xmath63 events with high invariant mass is mainly due to selection criterion for the energy sum of good cluster energies in the electromagnetic calorimeter @xmath640.8 .",
    "therefore we restrict our attention to @xmath65 pairs .    to reduce the background from poorly reconstructed events we impose an additional requirement on the visible energy of selected events : 10.5  gev  @xmath6612.5  gev .",
    "after all cuts described above about 112.5k events were selected .",
    "to reconstruct @xmath67 decays , which in addition to the decay products of the @xmath8 contain two charged pions in the final state , @xmath68 events were considered .",

    "the small differences between the mean values obtained from the gaussian fits and the pdg values can be explained by systematics due to the imperfect modeling of the @xmath81 distributions .",
    "we conclude that the first and second peaks are produced by the decays @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "the signal above background is determined from the fit to be , @xmath93 , with a statistical significance of 7.3 standard deviations .",

    "the total number of events and background in the interval 1.11  gev/@xmath11  @xmath96  @xmath971.135 gev/@xmath11 corresponding to the third peak is @xmath98 , @xmath99 respectively .",
    "the number of events in the shifted interval for the off - resonance sample is @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately the low statistics of the off - resonance sample preclude using it to subtract background in the on - resonance sample .",
    "however , additional information can be obtained from the study of the @xmath77 system .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath101-system @xmath102 for events from the observed peaks and background is shown in figs .",
    "these distributions are directly compared with model predictions as the efficiency corrections are negligible .",
    "the background , which is small , is not subtracted from the @xmath102 distributions for the three observed peaks ( figs .",
    "8a - c ) .    the @xmath102 distribution for the first peak ( @xmath103 decay ) is well described by the yan model  @xcite , where the hadronic transition between heavy quarkonia is considered as a two - step process : the emission of gluons from heavy quarks and subsequent conversion of these gluons into light hadrons .",
    "this transition can be described in the context of a `` multipole '' expansion scheme where the gluon fields are expanded in a multipole series .    the @xmath104 decay distribution ( fig .",
    "8b ) on the other hand is described by the moxhay model  @xcite . in this model",
    "the decay proceeds through coupling to @xmath17 , @xmath105 , ... , intermediate states  @xcite .",
    "this significant coupling to the flavored sector is motivated by the fact , that the @xmath88 lies closer to the open @xmath106 production threshold than the @xmath87 .",
    "this decay mechanism causes a double peak structure in the @xmath102 distribution .",
    "the multipole and coupled - channel amplitudes interfere in the moxhay model .",
    "the above models were already used successfully by the cleo experiment  @xcite to describe the @xmath107 distributions in the @xmath9 decays . the @xmath102 distribution for the decay @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "8c ) is better described by the yan model .",
    "the distributions for all resonance decays ( fig .",
    "8a - c ) show an enhancement at high masses .",
    "in contrast in the @xmath102 distribution for the background ( events out of peak ranges , i.e. from the mass difference ranges 0.3  gev/@xmath1080.555  gev/@xmath11 , 0.57  gev/@xmath1080.885  gev/@xmath11 , 0.905  gev/@xmath1081.11  gev/@xmath11 , 1.135  gev/@xmath1081.4  gev/@xmath11 ) the high mass region is significantly suppressed ( see fig .",
    "this difference in the behaviour of the @xmath102 distribution is an additional argument in favour of a resonance interpretation for the third peak .",
    "the branching fraction for the @xmath12 decay was extracted from @xmath109 the total number of @xmath15 in the data sample is @xmath110 , the nominal branching fraction @xmath111% .",
    "the evtgen event generator  @xcite with a matrix element taking into account particle spins was used for the monte carlo simulation of @xmath112 events .",
    "the monte carlo generated events were then passed through the detector simulation and reconstruction programs .",
    "the efficiency of the event reconstruction is then obtained from the monte carlo sample to be @xmath113 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the reconstruction efficiency is estimated by comparing the number of reconstructed @xmath114 events with the number of events that were calculated for the radiative return process @xmath115 in the model  @xcite .",
    "the difference is 35% and is a conservative estimate of the event reconstruction uncertainty .",
    "another systematic uncertainty comes from the poor knowledge of the @xmath112 decay matrix element .",
    "this was estimated from a comparison of the previously calculated efficiency @xmath116 with the efficiency calculated with a phase space matrix element and this systematic uncertainty results in 8% .    the preliminary result for the branching fraction is @xmath117 the width , @xmath118 , of the decay @xmath12 is ( 2.2@xmath711.0 )  kev , which is comparable with @xmath119  kev and @xmath120  kev .",
