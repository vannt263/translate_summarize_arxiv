    "the method of cosmic crystallography was developed by lehoucq , lachize - rey , and luminet @xcite , and consists of plotting the distances between cosmic images of clusters of galaxies . in euclidean spaces ,",

    ", we have sharp peaks in a plot of distance distributions .",
    "it is usual to consider the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological models of constant curvature @xmath0 with simply connected spatial sections .",
    "however , models with these spacetime metrics also admit , compact , orientable , multiply connected spatial sections , which are represented by quotient manifolds @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a discrete group of isometries ( or rigid motions ) acting freely and properly discontinously on @xmath7 .",
    "the manifold @xmath8 is described by a fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) in @xmath7 , with faces pairwise identified through the action of the elements of @xmath6 .",
    "so @xmath7 is the universal covering space of @xmath8 and is the union of all cells @xmath9fp@xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath6 .",
    "the repeated images of a cosmic source is the basis of the cosmic cristallography method .",
    "the images in a multiply connected universe are connected by the elements @xmath12 of @xmath6 .",
    "the distances between images carry information about these isometries .",

    "the cosmic cristallography method puts in evidence type ii pairs .",

    ", width=302 ]    in hyperbolic spaces , the identity ( or trivial motion ) is the only clifford translation . in this case , the cosmic cristallography method by itself can not help us to detect the global topology of the universe .",
    "several works have tried to identify multiply connected , or closed , hyperbolic universes by applying variants of the cosmic cristallographical method @xcite , most of which now rely on type i , in the absence of type ii , isometries .",
    "it is these variants that we call _ cosmic crystallography of the second degree_.    one of these @xcite , proposed by us , consisted of subtracting , from the distribution of distances between images in closed hyperbolic universes , the similar distribution for the open model .",
    "it did not pretend to be useful for the determination of a specific topology , but it might reinforce other studies that look for nontrivial topologies .",
    "uzan , lehoucq , and luminet @xcite invented the _ collect correlated pairs _ method , that collect type i pairs and plot them so as to produce one peak in function of the density parameters , @xmath22 for matter and @xmath23 for dark energy .",

    "@xcite obtained _ topological signatures , _ by taking averages of distance distributions for a large number of simulated catalogues and subtracting from them averages of simulations for trivial topology .    here",
    "we introduce still another second order crystallographic method , in the absence of clifford translations and sharp peaks .",
    "we look for signals of nontrivial topology in statistical parameters of their distance distributions .    as commented above on ref .",
    "@xcite , these methods are not as powerful as the original clifford crystallography , but will certainly be useful as added tools to help looking for the global shape of the universe .",
    "let the metric of the friedmann s open model be written as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the expansion factor or curvature radius , and @xmath26 is the standard metric of hyperbolic space @xmath27 .",
    "we assume a null cosmological quantity , hence the expressions for @xmath25 and other quantities are as in friedmann s open model - see , for example , landau and lifshitz @xcite .    to simulate our catalogues we assume for the cosmological density parameter the values @xmath20 and @xmath28 with hubble s constant @xmath29kms@xmath30mpc@xmath30 .",
    "the present value of the curvature radius is @xmath31 mpc for @xmath20 and @xmath32mpc for @xmath33 .    to generate pseudorandom source distributions in the fp , we first change the coordinates to get a uniform density in coordinate space : @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    ", we took the averages of these statistical parameters for ten simulations ( obtained by varying the computer pseudorandom seed ) , to get their tendency in comparison with those for the simply connected case .",
    "we proceeded in two ways to obtain a distribution in the open model , for comparison with the compact cases .",
    "in one of them , a simulated catalogue ( real ones are not yet deep enough for use in cosmic crystallography ) was obtained , with the same cosmological parameters and a pseudorandom distribution of sources inside the observable universe ( redshift @xmath54 ) . in the other , the analytical bernui - teixeira function for a uniform distribution in simply connected universes @xcite was used .",
    "we compare the results for eight compact manifolds with those for the simulated simply connected case , and with the b - t function .",

    "it is of course premature to think of a functional dependence on volume ( except for the obvious fact that , if the volume is so large as to enclose the observable universe , then the distribution of sources is indistinguishable from that for an open universe - see fagundes @xcite , for example ) .",
    "but we note a tendency of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath58 in compact universes to have values below those of the corresponding b - t function , and for @xmath57 to lie above that function .",
    "this could give us a signal of nontrivial topology in a future , realistic situation .",
    "we expect that the presence of type i pairs of distances is more evident for manifolds with smaller normalized volumes , or for models with smaller @xmath59 .",
    "in fact our results are better for @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath20 , where the observable universe is bigger than for @xmath40 .",
    "this implies more copies of the fp , and hence more topological effects .",
    "the set of these statistical parameters may eventually provide a complementary indication as for the multiply connectedness of a possibly negatively curved cosmos .",
