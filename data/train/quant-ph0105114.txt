    "we study two numerical problems : summation of finite sequences and integration of functions .",
    "besides the use of deterministic algorithms both are prominent examples of the application of monte carlo methods and , quite recently , also of quantum computation .",
    "when we study these problems from the point of view of these three settings , we are usually interested in situations at the border of feasibility , that is , for the summation problem in a huge number of summands @xmath5 , and for the integration problem , in a large dimension @xmath1 . clearly , the sum can be computed in @xmath6 additions exactly , but we want to understand if considerably fewer operations suffice to provide an approximation of required precision . for integration",
    "it is clear that we usually can not compute the integral exactly , hence one has to settle for approximations . for both problems the question arises of",
    "how good they can be solved in the given settings , and how the results compare .",
    "such an approach incorporates two aspects : providing good algorithms on one hand , and proving lower bounds  that is , bounds such that no algorithm can be better  on the other hand .",
    "only when this is done in each of the settings , one can compare them on theoretically founded grounds .",
    "basic tools for such an analysis are provided by the theory of information - based complexity , see traub , wasilkowski , woniakowski ( 1988 ) , novak ( 1988 ) , heinrich ( 1993 ) .    in this paper",
    "we want to give a survey of the state of the art in the above mentioned circle of questions .",
    "of course , comparisons between the deterministic and the randomized setting particularly well fit the topic of this conference . on the other hand ,",
    "we have also included the new aspect of quantum computation .",
    "although quantum computers exist so far only in laboratories and their full computational power is still hypothetic , many physicists and computer scientists believe in the future of quantum computing and already now started to investigate , in which problems a quantum computer can bring advantages over the classical one .",
    "it is intriguing that quantum algorithms , although using a completely different model of computation , also possess and exploit features of randomization .",
    "so it is natural to study their relation to monte carlo methods . in our investigations on quantum summation and integration",
    ", we found that certain monte carlo techniques proved to be quite useful for the quantum setting .",
    "we discuss this below .",
    "since this setting is certainly new to many people in the mcqmc community , we chose to present it in a detailed way to give an insight not only into the special results but also into the general framework and model of computation .",
    "let us now formulate the problems under consideration .",
    "we are given a nonempty set @xmath7 , a set @xmath8 of real - valued functions on @xmath7 and an operator @xmath9 from @xmath8 to @xmath10 .",
    "we seek to compute ( approximately ) @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 can only be accessed through its values . in this paper",
    "we shall consider the summation operator ( or mean operator ) @xmath14 and the integration operator @xmath15 , which are defined as follows : for @xmath16 we define @xmath17 and for an integrable @xmath18^d \\to { { \\bf      r}}$ ] we define @xmath19^d }   f(x ) \\ , dx \\ , .\\ ] ] we will study deterministic , randomized , and quantum algorithms for the computation of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , up to some error @xmath22 .    for the summation operator @xmath23 we assume that @xmath13 is from the set @xmath24 of all @xmath16 such that @xmath25 @xmath26 .",

    "the sobolev classes are defined by @xmath51 where @xmath38 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is here the weak partial derivative .    for the integration problem in sobolev spaces",
    ", we always assume the embedding condition @xmath54 which guarantees , by the sobolev embedding theorem , that the elements of @xmath55 are continuous functions , and hence function values are well - defined .",
    "let us briefly describe the organization of the paper . in section 2",
    "we survey known results about optimal deterministic algorithms for @xmath23 on @xmath27 and @xmath34 on @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "section 3 is concerned with randomized ( or monte carlo ) algorithms for the same problems . in section 4",
    "we give an introduction into the model of quantum computation and survey recent results of novak ( 2001 ) and heinrich ( 2001a , b ) on optimal algorithms for summation and integration on a quantum computer .",
    "we consider numerical algorithms of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is an arbitrary mapping .",
    "( in the terminology of information - based complexity , this is the class of all nonadaptive , in general nonlinear algorithms using @xmath60 function values . )",
    "a special subclass is formed by linear algorithms , i.e.   quadratures @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the error of a method @xmath64 of the form ( [ eq8a ] ) is defined as @xmath65 the central quantity for our analysis is the @xmath60-th minimal error defined for @xmath66 as with constant algorithms @xmath67 . for all the problems which we study one obtains @xmath68 , hence all the problems are scaled in the same way . ]",
    "@xmath69 the classes @xmath27 , @xmath56 , and @xmath55 are unit balls in banach spaces , so they are convex and symmetric .",
    "the operators @xmath23 and @xmath34 are linear .",
    "it is known that under these assumptions linear methods ( [ eq8 ] ) are optimal ( even among all adaptive , nonlinear methods ) .",
    "this was proved in bakhvalov ( 1971 ) , see also novak ( 1996 ) and traub , wasilkowski , woniakowski ( 1988 ) .",
    "therefore it is not difficult to find an optimal method for the summation operator @xmath23 on @xmath27 @xmath70 and its error @xmath71 where @xmath72 . of",
    "course we obtain @xmath73 for @xmath74 and therefore always assume that @xmath72 .",

    "it has the following form : choose randomly an @xmath60-subset @xmath108 , equidistributed on the family of all @xmath109 @xmath60-subsets and put @xmath110 where @xmath111 this @xmath87 satisfies @xmath112 note also that here the optimal method is linear .",
    "we summarize the known results on @xmath113 as follows ( see math ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "[ t4 ] let @xmath72 .",
    "then @xmath114 for @xmath115 only the order of the error is known , @xmath116 for @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "in particular it follows from  ( [ eq28 ] ) that @xmath119 for @xmath107 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "we want to mention a couple of interesting facts around relation ( [ eq28a ] ) .",
    "one might ask if the classical monte carlo method ( sampling independently , uniformly on @xmath122 ) yields this optimal rate for @xmath123 .",
    "it does not .",
    "the reason is that the variances of functions in @xmath27 , which we need for the error as defined in ( [ e21b ] ) , will not be bounded uniformly in @xmath5 .",
    "even more is true : no linear methods ( [ e21 ] ) can reach this rate .",
    "math ( 1992 ) proved that for @xmath115 and @xmath120 the error of optimal linear methods is of the order @xmath124 however , it is easily checked that a slight ( nonlinear ) modification of the classical monte carlo method does give the optimal rate : replace the function @xmath125 by @xmath126 defined by @xmath127 if @xmath128 and @xmath129 otherwise .",
    "then apply standard monte carlo to @xmath126 .",
    "it is also interesting that these results are sensitive with respect to the error criterion ( [ e21b ] ) .",
    "if we replace the @xmath130 norm @xmath131 by the @xmath44 norm @xmath132 ( or any @xmath133 norm with @xmath134 ) , classical monte carlo ( a linear method ) does provide the optimal rate  the same rate as ( [ eq28a ] ) .",
    "see heinrich ( 1993 ) , where this is shown for @xmath135 , but the proof gives also @xmath136 ( from which @xmath137 follows trivially ) .",
    "now we discuss the integration problem . for the hlder classes we have the following result from bakhvalov ( 1959 ) .",
    "[ t7 ] let @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ". then @xmath138    the results for the sobolev classes are again due to bakhvalov ( 1962 ) , see also novak ( 1988 ) and heinrich ( 1993 ) .",
    "[ t8 ] let @xmath38 , @xmath52 , and assume that the embedding condition  ( [ eq17 ] ) holds",
    ". then @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    "by now it is well - known that quantum computers ( if one succeeded in building them ) could yield considerable speed - ups for certain important discrete problems .",
    "( 1994 , 1998 ) quantum algorithm for factorization of integers is polynomial in the number of bits  while no such algorithm for a classical computer is known , and , moreover , nowadays secret codes firmly rely on the hope that no such algorithms exist .",
    "grover ( 1996 , 1998 ) presented a quantum search algorithm which finds a specified element out of @xmath5 items in @xmath141 operations , whereas classically @xmath142 are necessary .",
    "these two discoveries largely encouraged quantum computer research and triggered a stream of further investigations into the potential powers of quantum computers .",
    "up to now , however , this research dealt almost exclusively with discrete problems . here",
    "we want to know whether quantum computers are useful for problems like summation of reals or integrals .",
    "first we introduce the model of computation . for basic notions , background , and further material on quantum computing",
    "we refer to the surveys and monographs : ekert , hayden , inamori ( 2000 ) , shor ( 2000 ) , pittenger ( 1999 ) , gruska ( 1999 ) and nielsen , chuang ( 2000 ) .",
    "let @xmath143 be a 2-dimensional hilbert space over @xmath144 and let @xmath145 and @xmath146 be two orthonormal vectors in @xmath143 .",
    "the space @xmath143 represents a quantum bit , in the dirac notation we have @xmath147 for @xmath148 quantum bits we use the @xmath149-dimensional tensor product space @xmath150 with @xmath151 factors . an orthonormal basis is given by the @xmath149 vectors @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 there are @xmath149 different @xmath155 and this corresponds to the @xmath149 different possibilities of an information that is given by @xmath151 classical bits .",
    "the dirac notation for @xmath155 is just @xmath156 , instead of @xmath157 one finds @xmath158 or also @xmath159 .",
    "the formally different objects @xmath160 and @xmath161 or @xmath162 are often identified and called classical state or basis state .",
    "let @xmath163 denote the set of unitary operators on @xmath164 .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath165 with respect to the basis @xmath166 is given by @xmath167 we are only interested in normed vectors , @xmath168 .",
    "all such vectors are called ( pure ) `` quantum states '' . for each quantum state",
    "there is a probability distribution on the classical states : the probability of @xmath161 is @xmath169 .",
    "this is a typical feature of quantum algorithms  we can not `` read '' ( measure ) the coordinates @xmath170 of a state @xmath47 as above .",
    "when we measure @xmath47 , the result is probabilistic : we obtain a classical state @xmath171 with probability @xmath172 .",
    "now let , as in the previous sections , @xmath7 be a nonempty set , @xmath8 a set of real - valued functions on @xmath7 and let @xmath9 be an operator from @xmath8 to @xmath10 .",
    "we describe in the sequel what we mean by a quantum algorithm on @xmath151 qubits for the ( approximate ) computation of @xmath9 . for this purpose",
    "we first need to introduce the notion of a quantum query .",
    "we follow heinrich ( 2001a ) . like",
    "the classical algorithms get information about the input @xmath13 through function values , a quantum algorithm can access @xmath13 through a quantum query @xmath173 where @xmath174 , @xmath175 with @xmath151 as above ( the number of qubits ) , @xmath176 is a nonempty subset of @xmath177 and @xmath178 and @xmath179 are any mappings .",
    "the meaning of these components is the following : @xmath180 is the rule by which we associate to a bit - string @xmath181 the node point @xmath182 at which we want to evaluate @xmath13 ( we include the case that @xmath180 is not defined on all of @xmath177 which is convenient e.g.  if the number of elements of @xmath7 is finite , but not a power of 2 ) .",
    "when we have @xmath183 , which is an element of @xmath10 , we still need to convert it into a binary string  which is the rle of the mapping @xmath184 .",
    "with a quantum query @xmath185 and an input @xmath12 we associate a unitary operator @xmath186 which is defined on the basis state @xmath187 as @xmath188 here @xmath189 denotes addition modulo @xmath190 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath191 is a bijection on the set of basis states , and hence can be extended uniquely to a unitary operator on @xmath164 .",
    "a quantum algorithm with @xmath60 quantum queries is a tuple @xmath192 where @xmath151 is the number of qubits ( i.e.  the algorithm acts on @xmath164 ) , @xmath193 is a basis state ( the starting state of the algorithm ) , @xmath185 is a quantum query as defined above ( supplying the information about @xmath13 ) , @xmath194 are any fixed unitary operators ( the quantum computations ) , and @xmath195 is an arbitrary mapping .",
    "the mapping @xmath196 produces the real number which is the output of the quantum computation .",
    "the algorithm @xmath64 acts on input @xmath13 as follows : it starts with the state @xmath197 , to which @xmath198 is applied , which gives @xmath199 the mapping @xmath198 unites all quantum operations before the first query call .",
    "then @xmath191 is applied , leading to @xmath200 next @xmath201 is applied ( standing for the quantum operations between the first and the second query call ) , yielding @xmath202 then @xmath191 is called again , etc . in the end",
    "the algorithm produces the state @xmath203 let @xmath204 as we mentioned before , we can not access the components @xmath205 of @xmath206 directly .",
    "the state @xmath206 is measured , giving a random variable @xmath207 with values in @xmath208 , which takes the value @xmath161 with probability @xmath209 .",
    "finally the mapping @xmath196 is applied , which stands for the computations performed on the result of the measurement ( on a classical computer ) .",
    "so the output of the algorithm is @xmath210    note two important things : firstly , the algorithm gets information about @xmath13 only through @xmath191 , while the state @xmath197 , the unitary operators @xmath211 and the mapping @xmath196 are fixed from the beginning and do not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "secondly , each @xmath211 stands , in fact , for a sequence of elementary quantum operations , called gates ( like the basic logical operations in classical computation ) .",
    "the gates can be chosen in such a way that each unitary operator can be represented as a finite compositions of gates . for more details",
    "we refer to ekert , hayden , inamori ( 2000 ) . here",
    "we are concerned with the query complexity , meaning that we want to study the minimal error which can be reached by algorithms using at most @xmath60 queries ( this is essentially parallel to the previous sections ) .",
    "so the number of gates needed to represent ( implement ) the @xmath211 will not be discussed .",
    "what we described above is a quantum algorithm with a single measurement .",
    "one can put together several such algorithms to obtain an algorithm with multiple measurements : the output of the first part of the algorithm is used ( by a classical computer ) to compute the input of the second part , and so on .",
    "a formal description of this is given in heinrich ( 2001a ) , where it is also shown that from the point of view of query complexity it makes ( up to a factor of 2 ) no difference if algorithms with one or with several measurements are considered .",
    "the error of @xmath64 at input @xmath13 is defined probabilistically as @xmath212 and @xmath213 note that we require an error probability not greater than 1/4 . by repeating the algorithm @xmath0 times and computing the median of the results , the error probability can be reduced to @xmath214 for some @xmath84 not depending on @xmath0 .",
    "finally we define @xmath215    now we study the numbers @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "again we start with the summation operator @xmath23 on @xmath27 .",
    "the following result for @xmath219 is from heinrich ( 2001a ) , in the case @xmath31 the upper bound is due to brassard , hyer , mosca , tapp ( 2000 ) , the lower bound due to nayak , wu ( 1998 ) .",
    "we do not know the optimal order in the case @xmath229 , for @xmath230 there is a logarithmic gap between the upper and lower bounds .",
    "another gap is in the summation problem with @xmath231 and relatively small @xmath5 .",
    "summation in the case @xmath76 is open , as well .",
    "these questions are the subject of ongoing research .",
    "it can be read from the table that in the case @xmath233 monte carlo gives a speedup of @xmath2 over deterministic algorithms both in summation and integration . in these cases quantum algorithms give a speedup of @xmath3 ( over deterministic algorithms ) , that is , the monte carlo gain is squared .",
    "a similar pattern can be found in the case @xmath234 for summation of sequences .",
    "the speedup of monte carlo is here @xmath235 ( hence the advantage over deterministic algorithms is reduced as @xmath75 decreases ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the quantum setting this speedup is squared again . in the case",
    "@xmath236 for integration in sobolev spaces , the quantum gain is still better : even in the case @xmath76 , where monte carlo gives no advantage at all over deterministic algorithms , the quantum speedup is @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath237\\\\ f_d^{k,\\alpha } & \\quad n^{-(k+{\\alpha } ) /d }   & \\quad   n^{-(k+{\\alpha } ) /d-1/2 \\   }   & \\quad   n^{-(k+{\\alpha } ) /d-1}\\\\",

    "@xmath1 which , in fact , occurs in a number of important applied problems . in that case the deterministic exponent , @xmath238 or @xmath4 , is negligible , so the @xmath2 monte carlo and the @xmath3 quantum speedup essentially constitute the entire convergence rate . hence we observe a situation similar to that of grover s search algorithm : a quadratic speedup for quantum computation as compared to classical randomized algorithms .",
