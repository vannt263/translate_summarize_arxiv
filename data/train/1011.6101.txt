    "affine deformation is an essential assumption in the classical theory of elasticity . in the classical theory ,",
    "deformation is assumed to be distributed homogeneously in the material so that strain is spatially constant at all length scales .",
    "the affine assumption permits elastic properties of cross - linked polymer networks to be readily derived from theories of rubber elasticity based on the entropy of a single polymer chain in the network . in practice , however , such affine deformations only occur in perfect crystals under very small deformation . in polymer networks , especially networks composed of semi",

    "random thermal fluctuations of the cross - link junctions , along with thermal undulations of the polymer chains may also lead to non - affine behavior in polymer gels .",
    "inhomogeneities introduced into the network micro - structure during sample preparation can also introduce non - affine responses ; such inhomogeneities might be expected to be a function of reaction kinetics and other sample preparation parameters  @xcite .    over the years , the connection between shear deformation and non - affinity has been explored theoretically in a wide range of materials including rubber - like spatially homogeneous elastic media  @xcite , entangled or cross - linked polymer networks  @xcite , semi - flexible polymer networks with rigid  @xcite and flexible cross - links  @xcite , stiff rod networks  @xcite , biopolymers  @xcite , amorphous systems  @xcite and foams  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed that non - linear elasticity in polymer networks has its origin in non - affine responses  @xcite . in spite of continued interest in this problem and its fundamental importance ,",
    "relatively little experimental quantification of the non - affine phenomenon has been carried out in semi - flexible biopolymer gels  @xcite , and we are not aware of any non - affinity studies for the simple case of flexible polymers .",

    "this paper describes an investigation of non - affine shear deformations in a model flexible polymer gel : polyacrylamide gels with bisacrylamide cross - links .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the validity of the affine assumption in model flexible polymer networks is explored . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> the displacements of fluorescent tracer beads embedded in polyacrylamide gels are quantified by confocal microscopy under shear deformation , and the deviations of these displacements from affine responses are recorded . </S>",
    "<S> non - affinity within the gels is quantified as a function of polymer chain density and cross - link concentration . </S>",
    "<S> observations are in qualitative agreement with current theories of polymer network non - affinity . </S>",
    "<S> the measured degree of non - affinity in the polyacrylamide gels suggests the presence of structural inhomogeneities which likely result from heterogeneous reaction kinetics during gel preparation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the macroscopic elasticity of the polyacrylamide gels is confirmed to behave in accordance with standard models of flexible polymer network elasticity . </S>"
