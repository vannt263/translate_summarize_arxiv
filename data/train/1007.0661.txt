    "understanding the progenitors of the most energetic cosmic explosions , particularly gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and supernovae ( sne ) , is a grand pursuit . known already from their spectra",
    "is that stripped - envelope core - collapse sne ( ccsne ; `` stripped sne '' hereafter ) have progressively ( from types iib to ib to ic ) larger amounts of their outer hydrogen and helium envelopes removed prior to explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the dominant mechanism of stripping is not well known , nor are basic quantities such as the mass and metallicity of their stellar progenitors .",
    "the exciting connection between long - duration grbs and broad - lined sne  ic ( sne  ic - bl ) and the existence of sne  ic - bl without observed grbs ( see @xcite for a review ) raises the question of what distinguishes a grb progenitor from that of an ordinary sn  ic - bl without a grb .",
    "clear knowledge of the stellar progenitors of various explosions is essential for understanding the endpoints of stars over a broad mass range and for mapping the chemical enrichment history of the universe @xcite .",
    "two progenitor channels have been proposed for stripped sne : either single massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars with main - sequence ( ms ) masses of @xmath1 30 m@xmath2  that have experienced mass loss during the ms and wr stages ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or binaries from lower - mass he stars that have been stripped of their outer envelopes through interaction ( @xcite , and references therein ) , or a combination of both . attempts to directly identify sn  ib / c progenitors in pre - explosion images have not yet been successful ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a more indirect but very powerful approach is to study the environments of a large sample of ccsne in order to discern systematic trends that characterize their stellar populations .",
    "sne  ic tend to be found in the brightest regions of their host galaxies @xcite and are more closely associated with h  ii regions than sne  ii ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "sne  ib also tend to be found in bright regions of their respective hosts , less closely coupled than sne  ic but more so than sne  ii .",
    "this evidence suggests the progenitors of sne  ib / c may thus be more massive than those of sne  ii , which are @xmath316 m@xmath2  ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "other studies attempt to measure the metallicity by using the sn host - galaxy luminosity as a proxy @xcite , or by using the metallicity of the galaxy center measured from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra @xcite to extrapolate to that at the sn position @xcite .",
    "those prior metallicity studies do not directly probe the local environment of each sn ( which is different from the galaxy center due to metallicity gradients ) , nor do they differentiate between the different sn subtypes . here",
    "we present a statistically significant sample of stripped sne ( sne  iib and ib , sne  ic , and sne  ic - bl ) with robust , uniform , and direct determinations of their local metallicity in order to quantify the impact of metallicity on massive stellar deaths , building on our previous work @xcite .",
    "we note that in the final stages of this research , @xcite reported on a similar topic ; we briefly note the differences in the sample and results below .",
    "in table  [ sample_table ] , we present the sn sample for which we measured local metallicities .",
    "it consists of 35  low - redshift ( @xmath4 0.18 ) stripped sne , selected from the international astronomical union circulars ( iaucs ) according to the following criteria : ( 1 ) well - determined sn subtype , ( 2 ) discovered in targeted and untargeted surveys , and ( 3 ) h  ii region emission at the position of the sn ( within our slit width of 1 , see   [ specobs_sec ] ) , as seen in our spectra , with which to directly determine the metallicity at the sn site .",
    "we discuss the potential impact of our selection effects in   [ caveats_sec ] .",
    "while our sample is heterogeneous and not complete , we have good reasons to believe that it gives a fair representation of the kinds of environments that give rise to observed stripped ccsne .",
    "besides having sne from traditional searches ( e.g. , the lick observatory sn search ; @xcite ) that target luminous galaxies , we include sne from untargeted surveys ( e.g. , sdss , nearby sn factory ; see @xcite for more detailed discussion ) in order to mitigate any potential metallicity bias : since sn host galaxies in targeted searches are preferentially more luminous , they are usually also more metal rich @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we include host - galaxy spectra of the broad - lined sne  ic without observed grbs presented by @xcite , which were reduced and analyzed in the same fashion as the data presented here . for completeness",
    ", we also include metallicity measurements of all spectroscopically confirmed grb - sne ( @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ) .    the total sample of sne  ib , ic , and ic - bl whose local metallicities we are analyzing here amounts to 47  sne ( without observed grbs ) .",
    "optical long - slit ( @xmath5 wide ) spectra of the locations of faded sne were obtained with the 10-m keck  i telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plus atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) on a number of nights 20072010 .",
    "we generally employed a combination of the 300/5000 grism on the blue - side ccd and the 400/8500 grating on the red - side ccd here we also include our keck lris / adc observations of stripped ccsne in those cases where superimposed h  ii region emission lines were visible in the sn spectra .",
    "all optical spectra were reduced and calibrated with standard techniques in iraf and our own idl routines for flux calibration @xcite . for cases where the sn was still present , we eliminated the sn contribution following the successful method of @xcite .",
    "after correcting all spectra for their recession velocities we measured optical emission - line fluxes by fitting gaussians to the individual lines via the @xmath6 routine in iraf . for the derivation of the statistical errors , which typically amount to 510% of the emission - line fluxes , we follow @xcite and , in part , @xcite .",
    "the nebular oxygen abundance is the canonical choice of metallicity indicator for studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , since oxygen is the most abundant metal , only weakly depleted , and exhibits very strong nebular emission lines in the optical wavelength range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using our measured line fluxes of [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] ,",
    "[ n  ii ] , h@xmath7 , and h@xmath8 , we correct for reddening via the balmer decrement and the standard galactic reddening law with @xmath9 @xcite , and compute the gas - phase oxygen abundance via strong - line diagnostics .",
    "we employ three independent and well - known calibrations : ( 1 ) the iterative method of @xcite , as updated by @xcite ( henceforth kd02-comb ) ; ( 2 ) the calibration by @xcite ( henceforth m91 ) ; and ( 3 ) the diagnostic of @xcite ( both pp04-o3n2 and n2 ) , which is close to the direct electron temperature ( @xmath10 ) scale .",
    "moreover , we compute the uncertainties in the measured metallicities by explicitly including the statistical uncertainties of the line - flux measurements and those in the derived sn host - galaxy reddening , and propagate them into the metallicity determination .",
    "since the ppo4-o3n2 scale utilizes ratios of lines that are very close in wavelength , the effects of uncertain reddening and scaling between the blue and red lris ccds have negligible impact on the abundance measurements ( something we tested ) .",
    "the independently published metallicities of sne 2006jc @xcite , 2007uy , and 2008d @xcite agree with our values within the uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ ccsn_oxy_cumdist_fig ] shows the cumulative distributions of local metallicities in each of the three scales for different types of stripped ccsne : the ordinate indicates the fraction of the sn population with metallicities less than the abscissa value .",
    "the sn subtypes shown are sne  ib ( including sne  iib ) , ic , and ic - bl ( without observed grbs ) , and their respective numbers for which the requisite emission lines for that diagnostic were available are given in the legend .",
    "furthermore , we show confidence bands around each cumulative trend , which we computed via bootstrap with 10,000 realizations based on our metallicity measurements and their associated uncertainties .",
    "the metallicity measurements show well - known offsets between different scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , in _ each _ scale , sne  ic are more likely than sne  ib to be found in metal - rich environments , while sne  ic - bl ( without observed grbs ) have environments that are similar in metallicity to those of both sne  ib and sne  ic . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test reveals that the probability that both the sn  ib and sn  ic local host - galaxy metallicities have been drawn from the same parent population is low : 1% ( in pp04-o3n2 ) , 7% ( in kd02-comb ) , and 15% ( in m91 ) .",
    "the mean local metallicities in the pp04-o3n2 scale are 12 + log(o / h ) = @xmath11 ( for sne  ib ) , with a standard deviation of the mean ( sdom ) of 0.012 ; @xmath12 with sdom of 0.010 ( for sne  ic ) ; and @xmath13 with sdom of 0.016 ( for sne  ic - bl ) . in all scales ,",
    "sn  ic sites have oxygen abundances that are 0.140.20 dex higher than those of sn ib .",
    "our results are somewhat at odds with those of @xcite , who find a slight and insignificant difference between environmental metallicities of sne  ib and sne  ic in their sample from only targeted sn searches .",
    "we have no sne in common with their sample , and a detailed comparison of the two different samples is required to resolve the discrepancy , which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "while there are selection effects that went into our heterogeneous sample , none of them is expected to affect sne  ib systematically more than sne  ic , and hence should not be able to cause our observed trend .",
    "we checked that the sn survey mode does not explain the observed trend ; indeed , both sne  ib and sne  ic were drawn in almost equal proportions from both targeted and untargeted surveys ( table 1 ) , and the relative difference in the metallicity of sn  ib and sn  ic environments is visible even when only comparing sne from the same survey mode , albeit with more noise because of the smaller numbers of objects . furthermore , we checked that both sne  ib and sne  ic span comparable redshift ranges , with median redshifts of @xmath14 ( for sne  ib ) and @xmath15 ( for sne  ic ) .",
    "however , the broad - lined sne  ic in our sample extend to larger redshifts , with a median of @xmath16 .    while some surveys may have difficulty discovering sne in the central cores of bright galaxies",
    ", this detection difficulty does not appear to affect one sn type more than another in our sn sample : from table 1 , most of the sne included here were found far from the central 1 , and those sne that have offsets less than 1  comprise all types ( sn ib , ic , ic - bl ) .",
    "the only strong selection effect in our sample is that we require h  ii region emission lines to be present at the sn position with which we can determine the ism oxygen abundance , meaning that the sn location has to have had a large amount of recent ( i.e. , a few million years ) star - formation activity .",
    "however , this requirement affects sne  ib and sne  ic equally since our objects sample the same redshift range .      a reasonable suggestion for why the environments of sne  ic are more metal rich than those of sne  ib is that metallicity - driven winds @xcite in the progenitor stars prior to explosion are responsible for removing most , if not all , of the he layer whose spectroscopic nondetection distinguishes sne  ic from sne  ib .",
    "this explanation may favor the single massive wr progenitor scenario as the dominant mechanism for producing sne  ib / c @xcite , at least for those in large star - forming regions (   [ caveats_sec ] ) .",
    "while the binary scenario has been suggested as the dominant channel for numerous reasons ( see @xcite for a review ; @xcite ) , we can not assess it in detail , since none of the theoretical studies ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) predict the metallicity dependence of the subtype of stripped sn .",
    "however , our results are consistent with the suggestion of @xcite that sne  ic may come from stars with higher metallicities ( and masses ) than sne  ib , even if they are in binaries .",
    "the distribution of the sne  ic - bl is puzzling : sne  ic - bl seem to occur at metallicities between those of sne  ib and sne  ic , except grb - sne which are found at very low metallicities ( but see @xcite ; also see @xcite for other grb host metallicities ) .",
    "this may indicate another key ingredient beyond metallicity for producing ordinary sne  ic - bl , perhaps magnetic fields .",
    "we find only a factor of 5 difference between the lowest metallicity @xmath17 for sne  ib and the highest metallicity for sne  ic .",
    "since the mass - loss rate @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath19 @xcite , this difference in @xmath17 would imply a _ maximum _",
    "factor of 4 difference in @xmath18 between sn  ib and sn  ic progenitors .",
    "the question remains whether this small difference in @xmath18 is enough to be responsible for removing all of the he layer , or other factors are responsible that have a higher dependence on metallicity than line - driven winds , or the metallicity trend simply correlates with another property such as progenitor mass @xcite that may determine the sn outcome .",
    "all observations and theoretical work ( see @xcite for a review ) indicate that the initial mass function is universal at the metallicities found herein .",
    "our results validate the independent hypothesis of @xcite , which was based on indirect data : as an explanation for the fact that none of the 15 ccsne found by the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) in dwarf galaxies ( @xmath20 mag ) was a sn  ic , @xcite suggest that sne  ic do not occur at low metallicity since low - luminosity galaxies usually have low metallicity , in contrast to sne  ic - bl of which two were found by ptf in dwarf hosts . here we have supporting direct evidence ;",
    "we show that sn  ic host environments have systematically higher metallicities than those of sne  ib , while those of sne  ic - bl encompass both low and high abundances .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to measure metallicities directly and not rely on the host - galaxy luminosity ( @xmath21 ) as a proxy , as we show next .",
    "@xmath17 relationship @xcite , converted to pp04-o3n2 ( solid line ) including @xmath22 uncertainties ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the nuclear metallicity as derived from the sn host luminosity using the sdss relationship is not a good proxy for the local oxygen abundance of sn environs . here",
    ", we adopt a solar oxygen abundance of 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.69 @xcite , but note that the exact value of the solar abundance has no impact on our conclusions .",
    "sne found in targeted sn surveys are designated by extra circles , squares , and diamonds .",
    "the representative systematic error of 0.14 dex for the pp04-o3n2 scale is shown in the bottom - right corner . ]",
    "since we possess direct local metallicity measurements , here we test whether sn host - galaxy luminosity and measured nuclear metallicity is a good proxy for the local sn metallicity , as assumed in some studies . to that end",
    ", we drew the sn host - galaxy luminosities from the lyon - meudon extragalactic database ( hyperleda ) as their sample has been homogeneously compiled , and adopt their reported absolute @xmath23-band magnitudes , @xmath24 , in table 1 .",
    "note that the lowest - luminosity sn host galaxies are from untargeted surveys .",
    "furthermore , 14 galaxies in our sample have nuclear sdss spectra and their pp04 metallicities were taken from sdss .    in figure  [ ccsn_mbvslocalz_fig ]",
    "we plot the measured oxygen abundance ( on the pp04-o3n2 scale ) at the position of stripped ccsn vs. the sn host - galaxy luminosity , and for comparison the oxygen abundance as would be inferred from the sdss @xmath21@xmath17 relationship @xcite including @xmath22 uncertainties . for consistency",
    ", we have converted the @xmath21@xmath17 relationship from @xcite to the scale of pp04-o3n2 using the empirical calibrations of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ccsn_mbvslocalz_fig ] demonstrates that nuclear metallicity when derived from the sn host luminosity is not a good proxy for the local oxygen abundance of the environments of sne : the local metallicities are often lower than the inferred central ones ( because of metallicity gradients ; @xcite ) , but also occasionally larger ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in most cases more deviant than the @xmath22 metallicity uncertainties ( i.e. , @xmath25 dex ) would indicate from sdss .",
    "the differences between the predicted central and the measured local metallicity values range from @xmath26 dex to @xmath27 dex ( up to @xmath28 away from the sdss @xmath21@xmath17 value ) , with a median of @xmath29 dex . moreover , the nuclear pp04-o3n2 metallicities are deviant from the local values by an average of 0.13 dex , with extremes as large as 0.24 dex , and always more deviant than our measured uncertainties .",
    "thus , we conclude that nuclear metallicities are not a good measure of local metallicities .",
    "we present a statistically significant sample of 35  new host - galaxy spectra of stripped ccsn ( sne  iib and ib , sne  ic , and sne  ic - bl ) , and in combination with published host - galaxy spectra , we perform robust , uniform , and direct determination of their local metallicity .",
    "the aim is to search for metallicity trends that may let us differentiate between various debated sn  ib / c progenitor scenarios .",
    "we find that the environments of sne  ic are systematically more metal rich in three scales than those of sne  ib ( on average by 0.140.20  dex in all scales ) , with a k - s test yielding very small probabilities that they are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "we also show that sne  ic - bl ( without grbs ) are intermediate to those other classes .    for the future",
    ", we recommend this kind of detailed local metallicity study for all subtypes of ccsne from galaxy - impartial , large , and deep photometric surveys ( e.g. , ptf , pan - starrs , skymapper , lsst ) in order to comprehensively understand the impact of metallicity on massive stellar death , as well as to compute cosmologically important parameters , such as sn rates , as a function of metallicity .    _ note added in proof _ : after our manuscript was accepted , @xcite appeared on the arxiv - server on a similar topic . while we corrected one sn identification based on their work , we are not able to make more comparisons at this time .",

    "<S> a kolmogorov - smirnov test yields the very low probability of 1% that sn  ib and sn  ic environment abundances , which are different on average by @xmath00.2 dex ( in the pettini & pagel scale ) , are drawn from the same parent population . </S>",
