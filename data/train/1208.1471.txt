    "a long - standing issue in galactic star formation is : how much star formation relies on spontaneous gravitational collapse of cold clouds ? @xmath3",
    "how much star formation relies on collapse `` triggered '' by the imposition of external forces ? triggered star formation ( tsf ) may play roles on large - scales from compression by galactic spiral arms , on meso - scales from compression by supernova remnant ( snr ) superbubbles in starburst complexes , and on small - scales from compression by expanding h regions @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized that star formation in molecular clouds can be triggered by ionization or shock fronts produced by nearby massive stars @xcite .",
    "two major mechanisms for triggering by expanding h regions have been widely discussed : the radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) model and the collect and collapse ( c&c ) model .    in the rdi model ,",
    "the expanding ob ionization front ablates the surface of surrounding pre - existing cloudlets producing bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) , often with cometary structures , and driving inward a compressional shock that induces star formation .",
    "discussed since the 1980s , rdi now has well - developed hydrodynamical calculations showing the viability of tsf on timescales @xmath4  myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "observationally , two types of bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) can be distinguished : relatively massive cloudlets with widths of @xmath5  pc , which are often found to harbor more than a few stars at their tips ; and thin ( @xmath6  pc ) elongated pillar - like structures with a few or no stars at their tips @xcite . according to the rdi model",
    ", this distinction may reflect different evolutionary stages of brcs with narrow pillars interpreted as the last vestiges of the photoevaporated and dispersed cloudlet that has insufficient amount of remaining gas to form new stars @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations for the thin elongated pillars involve hydrodynamic instabilities in ionization fronts @xcite or ionization of large turbulent clouds without pre - existing cloudlets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in most cases ,",
    "molecular , infrared ( ir ) , and h@xmath7 surveys of brcs trace only the most recently formed stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while longer wavelength surveys select principally the youngest stars undergoing accretion from dusty disks , x - ray surveys efficiently select young stars due to enhanced magnetic reconnection flaring that extends to the main sequence @xcite . in a few cases ,",
    "@xmath8 observations have added the diskfree pre - main sequence ( pms ) populations to tsf clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "triggered brcs often show embedded mid - ir sources denoting protostars , while h@xmath7 , @xmath9 , and x - ray surveys reveal small clusters of disky and diskfree pms stars within and in front of the bright rim . in a few cases , spatial - age gradients in the stellar population",
    "are clearly seen where the youngest stars are embedded and older stars are aligned toward the ionizing sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this directly supports the rdi mechanism and implies that the existing clouds have been actively forming stars for more than 1  myr .    in the c&c model , ionization and",
    "wind shock fronts sweep up neutral material into a dense shell that becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments . individual stars or entire massive clusters may form inside these fragments .",
    "the theory is moderately developed @xcite and may explain a number of spectacular examples of embedded clusters found around h regions using long - wavelength ( mm to near - ir ) observations @xcite .",
    "they find a central ionizing star with a roughly spherical h region surrounded by a shell of dense molecular gas with dense fragments harboring young stellar objects .",
    "however , recent sph simulations by @xcite show that if an h region expands into a clumpy molecular cloud then the production of a molecular shell with dense massive fragments does not require the c&c mechanism .",
    "instead , triggered star formation would take place through simultaneous enhancement of density and global radiation - driven implosion of pre - existing molecular clumps .",
    "star formation triggered by h regions may be very common .",
    "spitzer_/glimpse survey finds @xmath1010 mid - ir bubbles / deg@xmath11 throughout the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that most of these bubbles enclose h regions ionized by o - b2 stars , many are surrounded by cold dust shells and many have bright - rimmed dust condensations protruding inside the h region .",
    "@xmath12% of the dust shell condensations have ultracompact h ( uchs ) regions and/or methanol masers , likely indicating triggering of massive star formation . based on the cross - correlation of the positions of the mid - ir shells with the positions of the very bright and red young stellar objects ( ysos ) from the red msx source ( rms ) catalog , @xcite estimate that the formation of @xmath13% of massive stars in the milky way could be triggered by expanding h regions .        due to violent energy feedback from massive stars in large star - forming complexes and individual h regions , the geometry , conditions , and history of star formation are often difficult to ascertain .",
    "the principal signatures of small - scale tsf  a star cluster in and around the cloudlet on the periphery of an expanding hii region  may be erased through removal of the cloudlet by stellar winds and uv radiation , or the kinematic dispersal of the unbound cluster within less than a few million years .",
    "thus , it is often difficult to identify sites of triggered star formation and to quantify the impact of triggering processes .",

    "the goal of the current study is to identify , understand , and quantify the triggered stellar population in the central part of the region associated with the largest brc , ic 1396a ( the elephant trunk nebula ) , and to estimate the contribution of triggered star formation to the total stellar population in both the central part and , with some additional assumptions , in the entire h region .      the ic 1396 h region , sh 2 - 131 at @xmath16 ,",
    "is excited mainly by the o6.5f star hd 206267 located at the center of the region in the 4  myr old cluster tr  37 @xcite[hereafter sa05 ] .",

    "its optical rim is the brightest of all rims and the cloud is thus likely to be the physically closest to hd 206267 @xcite . following @xcite we designate the two brightest features of the rim as rim a located in front of the @xmath23  pc diameter head of the globule and rim aa located further west at the shoulder ( trunk ) of the cloud ( figure [ fig_intro ] ) .",
    "the part of the cloud behind rim aa has its own designation : sfo  36 @xcite .",
    "a 0.3  pc diameter cavity in the molecular cloud is present in the head of the globule produced by the herbig ae star lkha  349 @xcite . outside this `` hole '' ,",
    "the globule is optically thick ( @xmath24  mag ) with molecular mass @xmath25  m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "early _ spitzer _ images revealed both bright diffuse mid - infrared ( mir ) emission and 17 class  ii / i stars in the ic 1396a globule ( * ? ? ? * their figure 2 ) .",

    "photometry with optical photometry and spectroscopy to reveal a rich lightly obscured population of @xmath26 h@xmath7 emission and/or li  6707    absorption stars .",
    "the population is a mixture of @xmath27  myr old members of the central tr  37 cluster and @xmath28  myr stars spatially concentrated in an arc in front of the globule ( see figure 11 in sa05 ) . in addition , @xmath29 heavily obscured ir - excess - selected objects were found inside the cloud @xcite .",
    "deeper _ spitzer_-irac maps from the time - series monitoring of the globule @xcite [ hereafter mc09 ] uncovered an additional dozen heavily embedded class i / ii ysos .",
    "the spatial distribution of sixty five disky members in / around the globule is shown in figure 16 of mc09 . recently , using the data from the int photometric h - alpha survey ( iphas ) , @xcite [ hereafter b11 ] identified about two dozen low - mass high - accretion t - tauri systems spatially concentrated in an arc in front of the globule ( see figure 18a in b11 ) .",
    "about half of these were newly discovered stellar members of the region .",
    "spatial clustering of optical stars with younger ages and increasing accretion rates away from the ionizing star hd 206267 ( sa05 , b11 ) led sa05 and b11 to propose the presence of a stellar population in front of the ic 1396a globule whose formation has been triggered by hd 206267 .",

    "the @xmath583 extra stars could be associated with triggered star formation in the originally larger ic  1396a cloud .",
    "as x - ray emission from pms stars is based on enhanced solar - type magnetic reconnection events rather than disk or accretion processes , x - ray selection delivers rich and clean samples of diskless stars missed by ir selection @xcite .",
    "previous studies have identified 129 yso members within our acis field of view .",
    "this study has doubled that census by identifying 130 additional stellar members in our x - ray (  [ membership_subsection ] ) and mir (  [ non_chandra_members_subsection ] ) catalogs ( figure [ fig_spatial_4panels ] ( b ) ) .",

    "a map of the combined sample of 259 members is shown in figure [ fig_spatial_4panels ] ( c ) .",
    "they appear clustered rather than uniformly distributed , and the distributions of the disky ( blue @xmath584 ) and diskless ( red @xmath542 ) stars appear to be offset horizontally from each other .",
    "this is more plainly seen in the source surface density maps shown in panel ( d ) , which were constructed using a fixed gaussian kernel .    directly in front of the molecular globule ,",
    "most of the diskless and a portion of the disky stars lie in a @xmath163  pc long and @xmath585  pc wide layer .",

    "assuming that the 2-fold increase is fully due to a triggered population , we obtain @xmath180% as a conservative estimate on the fraction of the old stellar members of tr  37 within the g1267 group , which implies that @xmath29 out of the 60 x - ray ysos detected in g1267 have a triggered origin .",

    "the mass of the observed molecular gas in ic 1396a is only @xmath657  m@xmath1 today @xcite .",
    "the inferred current sfe for the ic 1396a stellar population is thus @xmath658% at the top of typical sfe range measured in other active star forming regions .",
    "even higer sfes of @xmath647% were recently reported in a number of cases of likely triggered star formation , e.g. , cep  b / ob3b @xcite , sh 2 - 233ir @xcite , l935/ngc  7000 @xcite .",
    "however , the gas mass detected today could be only a fraction of the original cloud mass , so the sfe would be lower with respect to the original gas mass .",
    "thus , the high values of apparent sfe in ic 1396a and the other regions of triggered star formation indicate either an efficient star formation or an efficient removal of molecular gas by photoevaporation and stellar winds .",
    "intermediate - mass stars are often born surrounded by small groups of a few to a few dozen lower - mass pms stars @xcite . the stellar group `` g2 ''",
    "is composed of @xmath659 ysos around the b3@xmath584b5 binary system hd 206081 ( figure [ fig_spatial_4panels]c , d ) .",
    "the high apparent disk fraction of @xmath660% , the presence of 6 high - accretion yso systems from b11 , and the filamentary structure seen at 24@xmath149 m coincident with the stellar group suggest that the group was formed very recently .",
    "the projected distance between `` g2 '' and the stellar group `` g1 '' , located right along the optical rim a , is @xmath661  pc . theoretically , it is possible that stars recently formed in `` g1 '' having acquired velocity dispersion @xmath662  km  s@xmath19 have drifted @xmath663  pc in all directions , populating the field around `` g1 '' including the location of `` g2 '' with triggered stars . however , the distinct appearance of the two groups , and the notion of simultaneous formation of intermediate - mass stars and pms siblings , favor the view that the star drift does not play an important role here and that the present locations of the two groups are directly associated with locations of their distinct parental molecular cores .",
    "this is analogous to the current state of the ic 1396a cloud , where the two distinct stellar groups `` g3 '' and `` g4 '' inside the cloud are each associated with its own molecular core .",
    "this implies continuing star formation over millions of years when the rdi mechanism occurs in a larger than the presently seen ic 1396a cloud composed of multiple clumps .",
    "this view is consistent with the recent global picture of an h region expanding into a non - uniform clumpy molecular cloud , where triggered star formation would take place through simultaneous enhancement of density and global radiation - driven implosion of numerous pre - existing molecular clumps @xcite .",
    "signatures of small - scale triggered star formation on the periphery of h regions can be erased on short timescales and thus , it is often difficult to identify sites of triggered star formation and to measure the impact of triggering processes .",
    "there are only a handful of studies in the literature that have attempted to estimate the contribution of triggered star formation from expanding h regions .",
    "infrared emitting protostars in cloud cores and larger populations of pms stars with spatial gradients in stellar age indicative of long - standing triggering processes have both been seen associated with several clouds on the periphery of expanding h regions .",
    "much of the progress is due to the fruitful combination of x - ray and optical / infrared surveys ; the former captures the older diskless pms population while the latter detects the disky and accretion population .",
    "ic 1396 is a nearby , large shell - like h region , where traces of recent triggered star formation are still evident .",
    "we present new _",
    "chandra _ x - ray data and auxiliary ir _ spitzer _ and optical flwo / laica data of ysos associated with the central cluster trumpler  37 and the adjacent bright - rimmed cloud ic 1396a .",
    "these data are merged with the data from previously published optical - ir stellar catalogs of the region .",
    "the goal of this work is to identify , understand , and quantify the triggered stellar population in the region associated with the ic 1396a cloud and to estimate the contribution of triggered star formation to the entire h region .    out of @xmath664",
    "x - ray sources detected in the tr  37/ic  1396a area , 175 are identified as ysos and classified on 124 diskless and 51 disky objects (  [ ir_optical_counterparts_section ] ) . the majority of the remaining x - ray sources are contaminants , mainly extragalactic sources unrelated to the region (  [ membership_subsection ] ) .",
    "in addition to the 175 x - ray emitting ysos , we identify 42 non-@xmath8 ir - excess low - mass members of the region (  [ non_chandra_members_subsection ] ) . combining these data with the previous optical ( sa05 , b11 ) and ir ( mc09 ) catalogs of ysos",
    "yields a total of 259 ysos in / around ic  1396a cloud within the acis field , half of which are new members discovered in this work (  [ spatial_structure_section ] ) .",
    "the age and spatial distributions of young stars reveal a spatio - temporal gradient of stars from the ic  1396a cloud toward the primary ionizing star hd 206267 (  [ age_analysis_section ] and [ spatial_structure_section ] ) .",
    "young stars are found to be clustered along the ionized rim , both outside and inside the cloud .",
    "the clustering of young stars in front of the cloud is consistent with the previously reported arc - shaped layer of the low - mass high accretion stars ( b11 ) and/or the @xmath28  myr old optical stars ( sa05 ) .",
    "quantitatively , the number of stars clustered in front of the cloud is consistent with the 2-fold increase in the stellar surface density at the western border of the central tr  37 cluster (  [ spatial_structure_section ] and [ discussion_centralpart_subsection ] ) .",
    "the stellar age increases from @xmath623  myr inside the cloud , to @xmath665  myr in front of the cloud , to @xmath27  myr towards the central tr  37 cluster . combined with the results from the previous studies , these findings provide strong evidence for rdi triggered star formation over millions of years in the tr  37/ic  1396a region (  [ discussion_rdi_evidences_subsection ] ) . based on this evidence , we believe that the majority of the ysos found inside the cloud and the majority of the stars found clustered in front of the cloud were likely formed through the rdi process extending over @xmath666  myr .    by scaling the xlf / imf measurements obtained for different yso samples in the region (  [ total_populations_section ] ) to the number of the observed triggered stars",
    ", we estimate a total of @xmath0 triggered stars down to 0.1  m@xmath1 in / around the ic  1396a cloud , constituting @xmath642% of the total popualtion in the central part of the region today (  [ discussion_centralpart_subsection ] ) .",
    "furthermore , with a few additional assumptions we estimate the contribution of the triggered stellar population to the total population of the entire ic 1396 h region to be @xmath667% (  [ discussion_entire_subsection ] ) .",
    "thus , the currently active clouds on the periphery of ic 1396 add at least @xmath2% to the current cluster population .",
    "when past and future clouds are considered , the contribution of triggering to the star formation in the molecular cloud could be much higher .",
    "the inferred apparent value of star formation efficiency for the triggered population in ic  1396a is @xmath668 using current gas cloud masses (  [ discussion_sfe_subsection ] ) .",
    "our findings support a picture of continuing star formation over millions of years when the rdi mechanism occurs in a larger than the presently seen ic 1396a cloud composed of multiple clumps (  [ discussion_rdi_clumps_subsection ] ) .",
