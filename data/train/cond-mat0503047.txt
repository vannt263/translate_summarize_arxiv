    "the stochastic resonance  @xcite , which has been extensively studied in various systems including many - body systems  @xcite , refers to the phenomenon that an appropriate amount of stochastic noise may not hinder but trigger the coherence between the output signal and the weak periodic input signal . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed study of the two - dimensional kinetic ising model has been made and the size - dependence of the dynamic phase diagram has been identified .",
    "the globally - coupled kinetic ising model in the presence of a time - periodic external magnetic field has been investigated much , mainly because the simple mean - field method can be applied  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the model has been recently shown to possess double stochastic resonance peaks at two distinct temperatures  @xcite . however , except for some systems  @xcite , general applicability of the glauber dynamics is hardly justified in many real systems .",
    "the importance of the role of the entropy has been pointed out in the biological evolution  @xcite : in general , every species attempts to minimize its entropy , or in other words , to get negative entropy from the environment . from this idea",
    ", it has been shown that the biological evolution of an ecosystem can be well described by the so - called entropic sampling dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the ising model studied in this work can be related to a wide range of phenomena in biological and social systems , like the opinion formation problem in social systems under the time - periodic influence  @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been suggested that the ubiquitously observed self - organized critical behavior in nature is caused by the reversible information transfer with the surroundings of the system  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the entropic sampling dynamics , which is based on the reversible information exchange with the environment , can have realizations in many systems .",
    "we in this work use the globally coupled ising model , the hamiltonian of which is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ising spin at site @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the coupling strength , @xmath4 is the total number of spins , and the external magnetic field @xmath5 is coupled to the total magnetization @xmath6 .",
    "we first compute the entropy @xmath7 by using the entropic sampling algorithm  @xcite , applied to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) at constant magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the detailed balance condition for the entropic sampling reads  @xcite @xmath8   - s [ e({\\vec \\sigma } ) ] \\ } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the transition probability from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and for convenience , only a single spin is allowed to change at a given time . in the entropic sampling algorithm ,",
    "one initially starts from @xmath12 for all values of the energy @xmath13 , and obtains the histogram @xmath14 for several monte carlo sweeps , which is then used to estimate a new value of @xmath15 : @xmath16 as the above procedure proceeds , @xmath15 approaches the true entropy up to an additive constant , which is independent of the energy @xmath13 and thus may be subtracted on the condition that the minimum of @xmath15 is zero .",
    "once the correct entropy is obtained , the time evolution under the entropic sampling should satisfy the detailed balance condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) and we choose the following procedure : ( 1 ) generate @xmath17 which differs from @xmath18 only at one spin , e.g. , @xmath19 obtained from @xmath20 .",
    "( 2 ) compute the entropy change @xmath21   - s[e({\\vec \\sigma})]$ ] .",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath22 , accept the try , i.e. , change @xmath18 to @xmath17 ; otherwise , accept the try with the probability @xmath23 .",
    "one sweep of the above procedure for all the spins in the system corresponds to one time unit in the present work .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d ] shows the entropy @xmath24 , computed for the system of size @xmath25 under time - independent field @xmath5 , as a function of the energy per spin , @xmath26 ( henceforth , we measure the energy in units of the coupling strength @xmath3 ) obtained from @xmath27 sweeps per spin . in the ground state all spins have the same value : @xmath28 if @xmath29 , and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "accordingly , the ground state energy is given by @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "it is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] that @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "one can also compute @xmath24 analytically as follows : from stirling s series expansion , it is straightforward to get the entropy @xmath35 as a function of the magnetization , @xmath36 .\\ ] ] the entropy @xmath24 is then obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) with @xmath37 . since @xmath13 is a quadratic function of @xmath38",
    ", @xmath24 obtained in this way has two branches . in numerical simulations , we always observe only the upper branch , since it has tremendously more number of states than the lower branch .",
    "we confirmed that the numerically obtained @xmath24 is in a good agreement with the upper branch of the analytic one .",
    "however , since stirling s formula fails at @xmath39 , we instead use the numerically obtained @xmath24 for the time evolution of the system .",
    "the entropy @xmath7 is not a dynamic quantity but a thermodynamic quantity . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the case that the external magnetic field @xmath40 varies with time so slowly . in this low - frequency limit",
    "( i.e. , the driving frequency @xmath41 is sufficiently low ) , we may use the adiabatic approximation : at a given instant of time @xmath42 , the entropy @xmath43 computed above at constant external field @xmath5 is used for the time evolution of the system under the time - dependent field @xmath44 . in practice",
    ", @xmath43 is computed at 100 different values of @xmath5 in the range @xmath45 with @xmath46 set equal to @xmath47 throughout the work , and for a given value of @xmath44 , we choose @xmath43 with the value of @xmath5 closest to that of @xmath44 . from the symmetry of hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , one has @xmath48 , which is utilized for the time evolution during the period @xmath49 .",
    "the time evolution of the magnetization @xmath50 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtw ] for the system of size @xmath51 at driving frequencies @xmath52 ( a ) 0.005 , ( b ) 0.02 , and ( c ) 0.05 .",
    "observed is the coherence behavior at lower frequencies between @xmath53 and @xmath44 , which may be explained in the following way : when @xmath54 , the energy of the system is low for a larger value of @xmath53 . since the entropy is a monotonically increasing function of the energy and since the entropic sampling dynamics tends to decrease the entropy , the positive value of @xmath44 drives the system to have a larger value of @xmath53 , resulting in the coherence behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtw ] . at small driving frequencies ,",
    "the system has enough time to adjust itself to follow the external driving , and thus exhibits coherence behavior between the magnetization and the external driving well . on the other hand ,",
    "as the driving frequency becomes higher , i.e. , as the external driving changes in time too fast , the spins in the system do not have time enough to follow the driving @xmath44 .    such coherence behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtw ] , which we call _ entropic coherence _ to emphasize the role of the entropy , can be quantitatively detected by the occupancy ratio @xmath55 , defined to be the average fraction of the spins in the direction of @xmath44  @xcite : @xmath56 with @xmath57 denoting the time average . for the time sequence like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtw](c ) , the occupancy ratio @xmath55 has a value close to 1/2 since very few spins follow the driving @xmath44 during the time period @xmath58 . the occupancy ratio as a function of the driving frequency",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : orw ] for the system of size @xmath51 . as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : mtw ] , the occupancy ratio is observed to decrease with @xmath41 and approaches the value @xmath59 , signaling the disappearance of the coherence behavior at higher frequencies .    from the above observation , it is expected that the competition of time scales should play an important role in the coherence behavior .",
    "we use the reasoning similar to that in the standard stochastic resonance  @xcite and identify the two times scales as follows : one is extrinsic and originates from the external driving frequency , and the other is intrinsic , in principle not depending upon the external driving .",
    "the extrinsic time scale @xmath60 reduces as the driving frequency @xmath41 is increased , while the intrinsic time scale @xmath61 is fixed and independent of @xmath41 . when @xmath62 , the system has enough time to relax and to follow @xmath44 , while in the opposite limit @xmath63 , spins can not follow @xmath44 which varies too fast .",
    "the intrinsic time scale @xmath61 , computed from the correlation function @xmath64 in equilibrium with the ensemble average @xmath65 , has been shown to follow the simple power law @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , one can also interpret @xmath61 as the time scale required to overcome the entropic barrier  @xcite , separating @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtn ] shows the time evolution of the magnetization @xmath53 in the presence of external periodic driving @xmath40 with @xmath69 for the system size @xmath70 ( a ) 400 , ( b ) 1600 , and ( c ) 2400 . as the size @xmath4",
    "is increased , the internal time scale @xmath61 grows , and eventually when @xmath61 becomes too large compared with @xmath71 , the spins in the system can not follow the external field .",
    "the behavior of the occupancy ratio @xmath55 with the size @xmath4 is shown in fig .  [ fig : orn ] at external frequencies @xmath72 and 0.02 , which manifests the disappearance of the coherence behavior as the system becomes larger  @xcite .",
    "such a behavior may have interesting implications in sociological systems : social collective behavior in accord with external driving may disappear quickly as the group size exceeds the critical value .",
    "in other words , the control by means of an external agent ( e.g. , laws or other social regulations ) may become completely inefficient if the society grows too large .",
    "when this happens , enhancing interactions among people rather than strengthening social enforcement can be more effective for collective behavior to emerge .",
    "in summary , we have studied the coherence behavior in the globally coupled ising system under a time - periodic external magnetic field . the entropic sampling algorithm has been used both for the calculation of the entropy and for the time evolution of the system . when the external driving frequency is sufficiently low ( namely , when the external field varies slowly with time ) and when the system is not too large , the coherence behavior between the magnetization and the external field has been observed .",
    "it seems appropriate to call this phenomenon entropic coherence , which emphasizes the role of the entropy in the time evolution .",
    "it is noteworthy that if one uses the similar entropic sampling time evolution for the entropy as a function of , e.g. , the magnetization @xmath73 instead of the energy , we do not have the coherence behavior : @xmath73 can be computed from a purely combinatorial counting problem and accordingly , does not reflect the presence of the external magnetic field in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "it is plausible that this entropic coherence idea may be used to explain the coherence behavior of those systems the dynamics of which are more appropriately described by the entropy .",
    "the importance of the entropy has been pointed out in the description of the biological evolution  @xcite and the resulting dynamics has been suggested to be of wide applicability to a variety of the self - organized critical systems  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we believe that the present work can be extended to explain , e.g. , various social and biological systems in the presence of periodic external driving coupled to the internal degrees of freedom .    this work was supported in part by kosef grant no .  r14 - 2002 - 062 - 01000 - 0 , by the hwang - pil - sang research fund ( b.j.k ) , and by the bk21 program ( m.y.c . ) .",
