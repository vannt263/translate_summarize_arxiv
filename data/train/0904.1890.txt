    "cosmic strings@xcite could have been produced in the early stages of the universe as a consequence of cosmological phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this string may produce interesting effects associated with the conical topology of its spacetime . as examples of these effects we can mention the emission of radiation by a freely moving body @xcite and the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields @xcite , among others .",
    "it has been argued that gravitational interaction may be described by scalar - tensor theory , at least at sufficiently high energy scales @xcite .",
    "thus it seens natural to investigate some physical systems , as for example , one which contains scalar fields and cosmic strings , at these energy scales . in particular , it is interesting to consider this system in the framework of the brans - dicke theory of gravity @xcite .    at high energy scales , usually , the theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher dimensional spacetimes in which case is assumed that the extra dimensions are compactified .",
    "this compactification of spatial dimensions leads to interesting quantum effects like as topological mass generation@xcite and symmetry breaking @xcite .    in despite of the successes of the standard model of elementary particles , the fact that the gravitational interaction is not included and the hierarchy problem is not considered constitute unsatisfactories aspects of this model . in the context of a string theory which has been considered as a promise theory , in which these questions can be explained",
    "moreover , based on string theory ideas , the brane - world scenario has been proposed to take into account the hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scales and becomes the effective form to realize the cosmological scenarios .",
    "on the other hand , the consistency of string theory , which is a candidate to describe all fundamental interactions , requires that our world has to have more than four dimensions .",
    "originally , extra dimensions were supposed to be very small ( of the order of planck length ) . however , it has been proposed , recently , that the solution to the hierarchy problem may arises by considering some of these extra dimensions to be not so small . in the approach",
    "used in@xcite the space has one or more flat extra dimensions while , according to the so called randall - sundrum ( rs ) model@xcite , hierarchy would be explained by one large warped extra dimension . in the rs",
    "approach the 4d world is a 3-brane embedded in a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk . in this framework ,",
    "the standard model fields are confined to the 3-brane while gravity propagates in the bulk . in this scenario",
    "the hierarchy is generated by an exponential function of the compactification radius , called warp factor .",
    "the randall - sundrum model is defined in a 5-dimensional ads slice characterized by a background metric written as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 are",
    "lorentz coordinates on the four - dimensional surfaces of constant @xmath4 , which takes values in the range @xmath5 , with ( x , @xmath6 ) and ( x , @xmath7 ) identified , and the 3-brane located at @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 sets the size of the extra dimension , @xmath10 and k is taken to be of the order of the planck scale . in this approach , gravity propagates in the bulk while in the standard model fields propagate on the d-3 brane defined at @xmath11 .",
    "the energy scales are related in such a way that the tev mass scales are produced on the brane from planck masses through the warp factor @xmath12    @xmath13    in our case we will deal with massless fields in the bulk but this warp factor will appear in the effective couplings in four dimensions .",

    "<S> the brans- dicke parameter @xmath1 imposes stringent constraints on the mass of the dilaton which lives in the brane and help us to understand the energy scales . in this scenario we estimate the lifetime of the dilaton which decays into light gauge bosons and the dependence of this phenomenon with the brans - dicke parameter .    </S>",
