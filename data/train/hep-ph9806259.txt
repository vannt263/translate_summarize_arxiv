    "a correct treatment of heavy quarks in higher - order perturbative qcd calculations is important @xcite to precision phenomenology . among the reasons",
    "is the fact that a substantial fraction of the deep - inelastic cross section at hera is in heavy quark production .",
    "moreover , this occurs in a region where the heavy quark masses are not necessarily negligible with respect to the large momentum scales in the problem ( like @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , there is a considerable confusion @xcite about what constitute correct methods for treating heavy quarks . some of the difficulties occur because many treatments assume that quarks either are so light that their masses are negligible with respect to @xmath2 or have masses that are of order @xmath2 , where @xmath2 denotes a typical scale for the hard - scattering process under discussion .",
    "one has to be able to handle the intermediate region , where @xmath2 is somewhat larger than a quark mass but not enormously much larger .",
    "even when @xmath2 is much larger than all quark masses , the intermediate region must still be treated , because evolution equations are used to obtain the strong coupling , the parton densities , and the fragmentation functions from starting values specified at scales of a few gev .",
    "the symptoms of this issue are the different and apparently incompatible ` matching conditions ' that have been proposed .    in this paper i will give a relatively simple and general proof of factorization including the effects of heavy quarks .",
    "the only issue that will not be treated is the cancellation of soft gluons , an issue which is essentially orthogonal to the ones which are causing problems .",
    "the key ingredient is the observation that the short - distance coefficient functions ( ` wilson coefficients ' ) can legitimately be calculated with the quark masses left non - zero .",
    "previous work with aivazis , olness and tung @xcite and others @xcite has used this method ; what is new is the complete and detailed all - orders proof .",
    "this first main characteristic of the method , that quark masses are retained when necessary in the calculations of the coefficient functions , enables factorization to be valid when the masses of quarks are non - negligible with respect to the large scale @xmath2 of the hard scattering .",
    "hence the method avoids the normal problem when the @xmath3 scheme is used with massless wilson coefficients , that there are uncontrolled corrections of order a power of @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is a heavy quark mass .",
    "the second main characteristic is that the renormalization and factorization scheme consists of a series of subschemes labeled by the number of ` active quark flavors ' , @xmath5 .",
    "this is simply a generalization of the cwz scheme @xcite that is in standard use @xcite for the qcd coupling @xmath6 . when discussing the numerical values of parton densities",
    ", it is necessary to specify the number of active flavors that is used in their definition , just as in the case of the coupling .    the subschemes with different numbers of active flavors are useful in different ranges of physical scales , but with overlapping ranges of validity .",
    "since the subschemes are related by definite matching conditions @xcite , the choice of the number of active flavors does not result in any more indefiniteness in the physical predictions than does the freedom to choose a scheme or a value of the renormalization / factorization scale .    at first sight",
    ", the use of a sequence of subschemes instead of a single scheme appears rather baroque .",
    "however , it is in fact the simplest implementation of mass - dependent factorization @xcite .",
    "we require that the schemes implement decoupling @xcite of heavy quarks when appropriate , and that they implement the closest possible scheme to the mass - independent @xmath3 scheme , which is commonly used for most perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "if one did not have a sequence of schemes , it would be necessary to have mass - dependent evolution equations .",
    "the cwz scheme does have mass - dependent evolution in the following sense .",
    "if one chooses particular `` thresholds''more accurately called `` switching points''to change the number of active flavors , then the evolution kernels change at the thresholds . moreover ,",
    "the matching conditions at the thresholds can be thought of as corresponding delta - function contributions to the kernels .",
    "some of the confusion in the literature can be traced to the supposition that wilson coefficients must be calculated with massless quarks . indeed ,",
    "many papers , for example @xcite , treat factorization as a question of factoring out mass divergences in a massless theory .",
    "such methods founder when the quarks have non - negligible masses , since then some of the divergences are not literally present .",
    "it should be noted that the proof of factorization in @xcite does _ not _ assume that quarks are massless ( contrary to the assertion in @xcite ) ; the proof merely assumes that one is treating a limit in which the scale of the hard scattering is much larger than all masses .",
    "another source of problems is that many treatments of factorization @xcite take as their starting point an assertion that hard cross sections are the convolution of ` bare parton densities ' with unsubtracted ` partonic cross sections ' .",
    "although this assertion is widespread , it has no proof : it has the status of an unproved conjecture .",
    "indeed it is not obvious that it is even true .",
    "however , this bare parton conjecture is not necessary either to the proof of the factorization theorem or to its use .",
    "these problems with existing treatments , even without the treatment of heavy quarks , provide motivation for providing much detail in the proofs in this paper .",
    "the proofs apply equally well in the absence of heavy quarks .",
    "the treatment in this paper will be based on the basic power counting theorems derived by libby and sterman @xcite and on the methods of curci , furmanski and petronzio @xcite for organizing sums of generalized ladder graphs .",
    "the treatment of heavy quarks uses the methods of collins , wilczek and zee ( cwz ) @xcite .",
    "the powerful methods developed by chetyrkin , tkachov , and gorishnii @xcite for the operator product expansion with mass effects are consistent with the cwz scheme .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : good ] , i explain the requirements that i consider it necessary to impose on a good treatment of mass effects .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cwz ] , i review the cwz scheme for renormalization . in that section ,",
    "i also define a consistent terminology of ` light ' and ` heavy ' quarks , and of ` partonic ' ( or ` active ' ) and ` non - partonic ' quarks . in secs.[sec : large.q.basic ] to [ sec : masses ] , i prove factorization in the case that there is one heavy quark and that @xmath2 is at least as large as the heavy quark mass ; this is the case where the heavy quark is active . as an interlude in the formal proof , in sec.[sec : example ] , i provide a mathematical example of the asymptotics of certain integrals that mimic the behavior of the more complicated integrals in feynman graphs for qcd . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : small.q ] , i prove factorization for the case that the heavy quark may be treated as inactive .",
    "( ` non - partonic ' is a better term . )",
    "the general case , that there are several heavy quarks of various masses , forms a relatively simple generalization of the preceding work , and is treated in sec.[sec : multiple ] .",
    "an account of the matching conditions and of the evolution equations is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : match.evolve ] .",
    "this is followed by an account of the relation of the present scheme to the schemes of other authors , in sec .",
    "[ sec : comments ] .",
    "the conclusions are in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] . in app.[sec : bad.derivation ] , i explain a certain mathematical complication that appears in the middle of the proof .",
    "the overall aim of work such as ours is to represent interesting cross sections ( or other quantities ) in terms of perturbatively calculable quantities and a limited set of non - perturbative quantities that must at present be obtained from experiment .",
    "a typical result is that for deep - inelastic structure functions and other hard - scattering cross sections we have factorization theorems : the leading large @xmath2 behavior is a convolution of hard - scattering coefficients , which can be perturbatively calculated , and of parton densities and/or fragmentation functions .",
    "there are also evolution equations for the parton densities , etc .",
    ", for which the evolution kernels are perturbatively calculable .",
    "although the factorization theorems are true in a general quantum field theory , and not just in qcd , their particular utility in qcd is caused by the asymptotic freedom of qcd . without the use of factorization ,",
    "perturbative calculations of typical scattering amplitudes and cross sections involve integrals down to low virtualities where the effective coupling is too large for low - order perturbation theory to be valid .",
    "factorization theorems segregate the non - perturbative part of a cross section into a limited number of experimentally measurable parton densities , etc .",
    "moreover , typical cross sections depend on several scales and perturbative calculations typically have one or two logarithms of ratios of scales for each loop .",
    "since the qcd coupling is not very small , the logarithms can ruin the accuracy of practical calculations . by working with quantities",
    "that each depend on a single scale , one avoids this loss of accuracy .    for the purposes of this section",
    ", we will let @xmath2 be a ( large ) scale defining the kinematics of the hard - scattering process under discussion and we will let @xmath1 denote the mass of some heavy quark .",
    "a satisfactory treatment should satisfy the following requirements :    * the formalism should apply to all orders of perturbation theory and include arbitrarily non - leading logarithms . *",
    "explicit definitions must be given of the non - perturbative quantities , as matrix elements of operators .",
    "* the formalism is to be applicable to all the cases @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the errors are suppressed by a power of @xmath0 .",
    "* multiple heavy quarks should be treated without loss of accuracy no matter whether the ratios of the masses are large or not .",
    "the results in this paper will also satisfy some other requirements which are more matters of convenience than absolute principles :    * when a quark mass is large enough for decoupling to apply , calculations should exhibit manifest decoupling .",
    "that is , they should reduce to calculations in a standard scheme ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) in the theory with the heavy quarks omitted , and with no need to adjust the numerical values of the coupling .",
    "* the scheme should reduce to a standard scheme ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) when the masses are much less than @xmath2 .",
    "we will in fact use the @xmath3 scheme , so that standard hard - scattering calculations can be used unchanged in the case that masses can be neglected . *",
    "the previous two requirements apply to both factorization and to the coupling @xmath6 . * the evolution equations for the parton densities , etc .",
    ", should be homogeneous .",
    "that is , they should be of the form of conventional dglap equations or renormalization group equations rather than of the form of callan  symanzik equations @xcite .",
    "( the solutions of callan  symanzik equations need an extra level of approximation to make them useful for calculations . )",
    "the short - distance coefficient functions are almost completely determined once one has specified a scheme for defining the parton densities  in fact a scheme for renormalizing the ultra - violet divergences in the coupling and in the parton densities .",
    "the scheme defined in this paper is in fact a composite of a series of related schemes in the fashion proposed by collins , wilczek and zee ( cwz ) @xcite .",
    "first , it is necessary to introduce some terminology whose consistent use will aid our work .",
    "let us define a _",
    "` light ' _ quark or gluon to be one whose mass is of the order of @xmath10 or less , i.e. , under about a gev .",
    "similarly , let us define a _ ` heavy ' _ quark to be one whose mass is larger than a gev or so , so that the the effective coupling , @xmath11 , at the scale of a heavy quark mass is in the perturbative region . with this definition ,",
    "the charm , bottom and top quarks are the heavy quarks .",
    "we let @xmath12 be the number of light quarks , and @xmath13 be the total number of quarks . in our present state of knowledge of qcd",
    "we have @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "each subscheme of the cwz scheme is labeled by a number @xmath5 , which i will call the number of _ ` active ' _ ( or _ ` partonic ' _ ) quarks .",
    "these are the @xmath5 lightest quarks .",
    "all the remaining quarks i call _ ` non - partonic'_. ( it is also possible to call them _ ` inactive ' _ , but the term can be misleading . ) in each subscheme :    * graphs that contain only active parton lines ( i.e. , gluons and active quarks ) are renormalized by @xmath3 counterterms , with the exception of the renormalization of the masses of heavy quarks . *",
    "graphs all of whose external lines are active partons but which have internal non - partonic quark lines are renormalized by zero - momentum subtraction . *",
    "heavy quark masses are defined as pole masses , as in the work of smith , van neerven and collaborators @xcite .",
    "( we could also to choose to define heavy quark masses as @xmath3 without changing the formalism . ) * other graphs with external non - partonic lines are renormalized by @xmath3 counterterms .",
    "these definitions are applied to the renormalization of the interaction and to the renormalization of the parton densities , fragmentation functions , etc .",
    "a consequence of the definitions is that we will talk about ` three - flavor ' , ` four - flavor ' , etc .",
    ", definitions of the coupling and parton densities ( and fragmentation functions ) .",
    "use of such a sequence of definitions is already common practice for the coupling @xcite , and _ identical _ considerations apply to the parton densities . as a consequence it is meaningful to specify numerical values of the coupling and of parton densities only if the number of active flavors is specified .",
    "there are perturbatively calculable relations , or matching conditions , between the values of these quantities with different numbers of active flavors .",
    "i will now list properties of this set of schemes that are important for our purposes .",
    "their proofs are either in ref.@xcite or are later in this paper .",
    "* the scheme coincides with ordinary @xmath3 when all partons are active , i.e. , @xmath16 . *",
    "manifest decoupling is obeyed .",
    "if we have a process in which all external momentum scales are much less than the masses of the non - partonic quarks , then we can omit all graphs containing non - partonic quarks and only make a power - suppressed error .",
    "in contrast , in a scheme that does not have manifest decoupling , we would have to adjust the numerical values of the couplings and of the parton densities .",
    "* evolution equations for the densities of active partons and of the coupling @xmath6 are _ exactly _ those of a pure @xmath3 scheme in a theory with @xmath5 quark flavors .",
    "this is a consequence of the mass - independence of uv counterterms in the @xmath3 scheme , together with an application of the decoupling theorem @xcite . *",
    "the relation between the subschemes is just a particular case of the relation between different renormalization schemes .",
    "the matching conditions between the schemes with different numbers of active quarks is known to three loops for the coupling @xcite and to two loops for the parton densities @xcite .",
    "the matching condition between quantities in the subschemes with @xmath17 and and @xmath18 active flavors involves no large logarithms of masses , provided that the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath19 is of order the mass of the @xmath20th quark .",
    "( for example , we would choose @xmath19 to be of order the mass of the mass of the charm quark when we compute the relation between the three- and four - flavor schemes . ) * in general , if one varies the physical scale @xmath2 of some process ( e.g. , deep - inelastic scattering ) , one should vary the number of active quarks suitably .",
    "quarks of mass much less than @xmath2 are to be active , while quarks of mass much larger than @xmath2 should be non - partonic .",
    "one has a choice for those flavors whose masses are close to @xmath2 , and i suspect a bias in favor of keeping quarks non - partonic will lead to more accurate calculations . * the light partons are always to be treated as active .",
    "it might be considered odd that in a region where @xmath2 is of the order of the mass of some heavy quark we have a choice as to whether to treat the quark as active or not .",
    "the freedom is entirely comparable to the freedom to choose the precise value of the renormalization / factorization scale . indeed",
    "the existence of a region where the two subschemes have comparable accuracy is vital to the success of a good treatment of heavy quarks , because it enables reliable perturbative calculations to be made of the matching conditions @xcite between the two subschemes .",
    "commonly @xcite , the scheme is implemented by choosing what can be called `` matching '' and `` switching '' points to be equal to the relevant heavy quark mass .",
    "for example , in treating dis with a charm quark , one often sets the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath19 to the kinematic variable @xmath2 .",
    "then one uses a 3-flavor subscheme if @xmath21 and a 4-flavor subscheme if @xmath22 .",
    "one also chooses to evaluate the matching conditions between the subschemes at @xmath23 .",
    "none of these choices is essential , and any change gives a change in the physical predictions only because of the errors due to the truncation of the perturbation series .",
    "it is probably only appropriate ( i.e. , suitable for fixed order perturbative calculations ) to use a 4-flavor subscheme if one is treating a situation where the cross section is above the physical threshold for charm production , which is at @xmath24 .",
    "hence , if @xmath25 is rather large , then it would be appropriate to use the 3-flavor scheme even when @xmath2 is substantially above @xmath26 .",
    "note that there are three distinct mass scales referred to in the previous paragraph : a matching point , a switching point and a physical threshold .    of course",
    ", one is free to disregard the cwz scheme and use some other scheme , provided that it provides complete definitions of the parton densities and of the coupling .",
    "however , this does not affect the validity of the cwz definitions .",
    "the significance of the cwz definitions is that when all flavors are active , they are _ exactly _ the @xmath3 ones .",
    "the principles of the proof can be best explained by first considering the case that there is exactly one heavy quark , of mass @xmath1",
    ". there will be in effect two factorization theorems to prove .",
    "the first , whose treatment starts in this section , is appropriate when the physical scale @xmath2 of the hard scattering is at least at large in magnitude as @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", it is appropriate to treat the heavy quark as active : the factorization theorem will include a term with a heavy quark density .    the second case , whose treatment starts in sec .  [",
    "sec : small.q ] , is appropriate when @xmath28 , and it treats the heavy quark as non - partonic .",
    "then the factorization theorem has no term with a heavy quark density , and all heavy - quark production is to be found ( at leading power ) in the coefficient function .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is an overlap region , @xmath8 , where both theorems are appropriate , i.e. , they give comparable accuracy in predictions based on finite - order calculations of coefficient functions .",
    "so in this section , we start the treatment of a factorization theorem for deep - inelastic structure functions , given the assumption that @xmath29",
    ". a single factorization formula will cover the case that @xmath2 is much bigger than the heavy quark mass , as well as the case that @xmath2 and the heavy quark mass are comparable , and the intermediate region .",
    "our notation for the photon momentum @xmath30 , the hadron momentum @xmath31 , and for the bjorken variable @xmath25 is standard . as usual @xmath32 .",
    "we will assume that quark masses are at most of order @xmath2 .",
    "when reading through the proof , it may be worth the reader s while to refer ahead to sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] . there",
    ", a simple mathematical example is given of the kinds of integral under discussion , and it is possible more easily to see the meaning of the formal manipulations in the proof .",
    "in the bjorken limit ( large @xmath2 , fixed @xmath25 ) , the leading power behavior is given by the regions symbolized in fig.[fig : leading.region ] , as was proved by libby and sterman @xcite .",
    "in each region , there is what we call a hard subgraph @xmath33 , all of whose lines are effectively off - shell by order @xmath34 .",
    "it is to this subgraph that the virtual photons couple .",
    "the rest of the graph has lines that are much lower in virtuality and that are approximately collinear to the momentum @xmath31 of the target .",
    "the latter part of the graph we will call the target subgraph @xmath35",
    ". we will give more quantitative characterizations of the regions later .",
    "( for example , we must deal with the fact that there is a final - state cut , so that some lines in @xmath33 are actually on - shell instead of having virtuality @xmath34 . )",
    "although one often does purely perturbative calculations in which the target is a quark or gluon state , our treatment will also apply to hadron targets . in that case , suitable bound - state wave - functions will be incorporated in @xmath35 .",
    "a result of the power counting is that for a contribution to have the leading power  to be of ` leading twist '  the two subgraphs @xmath33 and @xmath35 must be connected to each other by two parton lines , one on each side of the final - state cut .",
    "the set of decompositions into two such subgraphs @xmath33 and @xmath35 is in one - to - one correspondence with the set of leading regions .",
    "there are two exceptions to this correspondence .",
    "the main exception is that if the heavy quark mass is of order @xmath2 , then the @xmath33 and @xmath35 subgraphs are connected by light parton lines , but not by heavy quark lines .",
    "this exception arises because the definition of the region implies that the lines joining @xmath33 and @xmath35 have virtuality much less than @xmath2 , and this is not possible if the lines are heavy quark lines of a mass comparable to @xmath2 .",
    "the second exception to the power - counting rules is that gluons with scalar polarization can couple the @xmath33 and @xmath35 subgraphs without a power - law penalty , at least in a covariant gauge : we will discuss this issue in more detail later in the section .",
    "we define the subgraph @xmath35 to include the full propagators of the lines joining it to @xmath33 , since these lines have momenta collinear to the target .",
    "hence the hard subgraph @xmath33 is one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) in these same lines .    in this and",
    "later figures , we have the initial state at the bottom of the graph , and the hard subgraph to the left .",
    "this ensures that the orientation of the figures corresponds to the equations we will write for convolutions of amplitudes . for example , we can write fig .",
    "[ fig : leading.region ] as @xmath36 .",
    "any region of loop - momentum space that can not be characterized by fig .",
    "[ fig : leading.region ] is suppressed by a power of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the statement that the leading regions have the form of fig .",
    "[ fig : leading.region ] is true to all orders in the coupling and includes not just the leading logarithms but all non - leading logarithms as well .",
    "a typical graph can have many different decompositions into hard and target subgraphs .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig:3rung.graph ] has four such decompositions , comprises the whole of the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig:3rung.graph ] with the exception of the right - most two external lines .",
    "@xmath35 is then a trivial graph , in essence a factor of unity . ] and hence four leading regions .",
    "the possibility of having more than one leading region is characteristic not only of qcd , but of any renormalizable field theory , since adding extra lines inside @xmath33 in a theory with a dimensionless coupling does not change the counting of powers of @xmath2 .",
    "it is the large multiplicity of regions that results in many of the complications in the proof of factorization .",
    "in addition , it results in the logarithmic dependence on @xmath2 that is typical of higher order calculations in qcd .",
    "= 3.5 in    in contrast , super - renormalizable theories ( e.g. , qcd in less than four space - time dimensions ) have couplings with positive mass dimension .",
    "this implies that there is a single leading region .",
    "it is of the form of fig .",
    "[ fig : leading.region ] , but with the smallest possible graph for @xmath33 .",
    "that is , the unique .",
    "] leading region has the form of the handbag diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : handbag ] .",
    "although super - renormalizable theories do not represent real strong - interaction physics , experience in treating simple cases is useful in formulating the factorization theorem .",
    "factorization , etc . , for super - renormalizable theories is equivalent to the set of results obtained many years ago by landshoff and polkinghorne in context of their covariant parton model @xcite .",
    "= 2.5 in    let us now list some technical complications that we will be able to ignore , but that are treated in other papers @xcite on factorization :    * although we have defined the target part @xmath35 to consists only of lines with collinear momenta , it may in fact contain some highly virtual lines .",
    "these are confined to subgraphs that are ultra - violet divergent and just generate the usual uv divergences that are cancelled by counterterms in the lagrangian .",
    "this complication does not affect our proofs , since none of the divergent subgraphs in qcd overlap between @xmath35 and @xmath33 , and our proofs will treat @xmath35 as a black box .",
    "* [ unitarity.sum ] although we treat the hard subgraph as being composed of lines all of which have large virtuality , this subgraph necessarily includes at least one final - state line .",

    "however , if a suitable ` physical ' gauge is used ( e.g. , axial gauge with a gauge fixing vector proportional to @xmath30 ) , such contributions are not present @xcite .",
    "there are some subtleties associated with the use of such a gauge .",
    "for example , the analysis of the leading regions in refs .",
    "@xcite relies critically on landau s analysis of the singularities associated with the denominators of feynman propagators .",
    "but physical gauges introduce extra unphysical singularities  the physical gauges are not as physical as one often supposes . for the purposes of this paper",
    "it is sufficient to ignore this complication , or to assume that the appropriate light - like gauge is being used . *",

    "our proof of factorization has demonstrated that all relevant effects of non - zero quark masses can be found either in the coefficient functions or in the starting values of the parton densities .    of course , one can perturbatively compute the values of the heavy quark densities , by the methods that witten @xcite first devised . in our formalism",
    "this is most conveniently done in association with the version of factorization that is appropriate when @xmath1 is bigger than @xmath2 , which we will treat in sect.[sec : small.q ] .",
    "in conventional treatments of factorization , masses are set to zero in the coefficient functions .",
    "but our treatment has preserved masses , and this is the key to a correct treatment of the effects of heavy quarks .",
    "the massless limit can be taken in the coefficient function .",
    "this can be done since the @xmath113 factors in eq .",
    "( [ coefficient.ren ] ) cancel leading power contributions from all regions except where all the loop momenta are of order @xmath34 in virtuality , and except for regions that contribute to the ( cancelled ) uv divergences . thus setting a mass @xmath59 to zero",
    "gives an error that is a power of @xmath179 .",
    "a particular consequence of this result is that all potential collinear divergences are cancelled .",
    "thus the coefficient function is a truly infra - red safe quantity .",
    "if the renormalization mass @xmath19 is chosen to be of order @xmath2 , then perturbative calculations can be made .",
    "since errors in setting a mass to zero are a power of @xmath179 , taking the massless limit is sensible if all the quark masses are of the order of a typical hadronic mass or smaller ; the errors are no bigger than errors that have been made elsewhere in the derivation of factorization",
    ".      however , there are quarks whose masses are larger than this ( charm , etc . ) .",
    "let us first treat the case that there is only one heavy quark , of mass @xmath1 .",
    "it is not always appropriate to set @xmath247 in the coefficient functions , since the error in doing so is of order @xmath248 , which may be much bigger than the error associated with dropping the remainder term in the derivation of the factorization theorem .",
    "a error of order @xmath248 may also be larger than the error caused by using a finite order truncation of the perturbation series for the coefficient function .    now , the error in the factorized form of the structure function is of order @xmath98 , and the derivation of this error estimate is valid over the whole range of quark mass for which @xmath249 .",
    "this means both the region where @xmath2 is of order @xmath1 and the region where @xmath2 is much bigger than @xmath1 .",
    "the remainder term is uniformly suppressed by a power of @xmath0 .",
    "the sole effect of a heavy quark line is to restrict its virtuality to be at least of order @xmath250 , and this is completely compatible with the derivation of the error estimate .",
    "we therefore have a factorization theorem that is valid in the whole of the region that @xmath249 , as we have already observed .",
    "if @xmath2 is sufficiently much bigger than all the quark masses , then we may set all the masses to zero in the coefficient function .",
    "if some of the quark masses are non - negligible , then we simply leave their masses at their correct values",
    ".    however , these considerations only apply if @xmath251 .",
    "if , on the contrary , a heavy quark mass is much larger than @xmath2 ; then the coefficient functions that we constructed have logarithms of @xmath4 in this region of relatively small @xmath2 .",
    "this is a problem we will treat in sec .",
    "[ sec : small.q ] .",
    "the work in this section is based on a factorization theorem derived under the condition that @xmath2 is at least comparable with @xmath1 .    despite the fact that we have retained heavy quark masses wherever necessary , the kernels of the the evolution equations for the parton densities are in fact the same as with the quark masses set to zero , i.e. , they are identical to the ordinary dglap equations in the @xmath3 scheme .",
    "this happens because the evolution equations are in our approach just the renormalization group equations for the renormalized parton densities .",
    "the altarelli - parisi kernels are anomalous dimensions , obtained from the renormalization factor @xmath252 . since the renormalization counterterms in the @xmath3 scheme are mass - independent , so are the altarelli - parisi kernels , a statement that is true not only for the leading - order @xmath6 terms in the kernels , but for all higher order corrections .",
    "the analytic core of our proof is in the definition of the @xmath79 operation and in the proof that the remainder term , eq.([remainder ] ) , is suppressed by a power of @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of the proof is simple linear algebra .",
    "it is possible to adjust to the definition of @xmath79 to make calculations more convenient .",
    "we have already made one such redefinition ",
    "see eqs.([z.def1 ] ) and ( [ z.def.massive ] ) .    in the next section",
    "we will propose one further redefinition of @xmath79 that will simplify some calculations , by allowing heavy quark masses to be set to zero in certain parts of the calculations of the coefficient functions .",
    "but first we must characterize the allowed redefinitions .",
    "we address explicitly only the momentum dependence of @xmath79 .",
    "the spin - dependent part can be discussed in a similar fashion .",
    "the first and most essential property is that @xmath79 provide a good approximation to leading regions , of the form of fig.[fig : leading.region ] , i.e. , that @xmath253 whenever we are in an integration region where the virtualities in @xmath33 are much bigger than the virtualities in @xmath35 .",
    "the second property is that when we go outside the momenta for which @xmath79 gives a good approximation , insertion of a factor of @xmath79 should not produce a result that is much bigger than the original . to make this precise ,",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath35 be subdiagrams that could be used in fig.[fig : leading.region ] .",

    "the exception is that we can have a logarithmic ultra - violet divergence for large @xmath257 .",
    "the above properties are sufficient to ensure that the remainder as defined in eq .",
    "( [ remainder ] ) is power suppressed .",
    "then we can obtain the renormalized factorization theorem eq.([factorization.ren ] ) given that any divergences in the operator matrix elements are at worst logarithmic .",
    "a final property is needed in order that the factorization theorem be of a usefully simple form .",
    "we choose this to mean that factorization involves a convolution in just one variable , a longitudinal momentum fraction .",
    "this forces the momentum - dependent part @xmath79 to be of the form @xmath258 here the function @xmath259 must be unity when @xmath260 is less than about @xmath2 and @xmath261 is less than about @xmath262 . moreover , the approximated momentum @xmath263 must approach @xmath264 in the collinear limit .",
    "both @xmath259 and @xmath263 must be smooth functions . in order that the convolution in the factorization formula be a convolution in one variable ,",
    "the approximated momentum @xmath265 must be independent of @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "perhaps the simplest and most natural definition is to write @xmath268 which is just like eq .",
    "( [ z.def1 ] ) , except for a cut - off on the transverse momentum entering from the right .",
    "this definition would be favored , for example , by brodsky @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to defining parton densities by integrals of the following form : @xmath269 where there is an integral over all virtualities of the parton from the target and an integral up to a certain maximum transverse momentum , and we are using the fourier - transformed fields .",
    "this definition suffers from two inconveniences .",
    "the first is that in a gauge theory it does not give parton densities that are manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "the second is that the evolution equations ( in @xmath270 ) are not exactly homogeneous equations of the altarelli - parisi form ; a subsidiary expansion for large @xmath19 is needed to get the altarelli - parisi equations .    neither disadvantage is fatal , but we prefer to use a definition in which @xmath271 , as in eqs .",
    "( [ z.def1 ] ) and ( [ z.def.massive ] ) .",
    "the parton densities are then precisely of the form of light - cone operators , and uv renormalization must be applied as described in earlier sections .",
    "the remaining freedom in defining @xmath79 resides in what it does to the factors on its left , and in the definition of the approximated momentum @xmath272 .",
    "the most natural definition is perhaps the one in eq .",
    "( [ z.def.massive ] ) . but",
    "a simplification is possible .",
    "let us first recall the classification of partons as light or heavy according to whether their masses are less than or greater than a few hundred mev .",
    "thus the gluon , and the up , down , and strange quarks are light , while the charm , bottom , and top quarks are heavy .",
    "the importance of this distinction is that it is always legitimate to neglect light parton masses in the hard scattering coefficients , since the errors in doing so are of the same order as the non - leading power corrections ( ` higher - twist terms ' ) that constitute the remainder in the factorization formula .",
    "but it is not always valid to neglect heavy quark masses .",
    "even if @xmath2 is much larger than the mass @xmath1 of some heavy quark , the error resulting from replacing @xmath1 by zero in the coefficient function is larger than the errors that result from neglect of higher twist terms .",
    "( in practice we normally have larger errors that result from truncation of the perturbation expansion of the coefficient functions , and then it will be sensible to neglect @xmath1 at suitably high @xmath2 . )",
    "note , however , that it is never legitimate to neglect masses in the parton density .",
    "so it is convenient to equip @xmath79 with a prescription to set light parton masses in everything to its left .",
    "this new operation we call @xmath273 . consider a convolution @xmath36 like that implied by fig.[fig : leading.region ] , and suppose that @xmath33 and @xmath35 are joined by a pair of light parton lines .",
    "we have @xmath274 so that @xmath275 where @xmath276 , and , for simplicity , we have omitted the treatment of the dirac matrices , which is unchanged from our earlier work .",
    "we use @xmath59 and @xmath1 to refer to light and heavy parton masses .    in the above equations",

    "this is , of course , normally not true if @xmath33 is a simple sum of feynman graph , such as corresponds to the @xmath33 subgraph in fig.[fig : leading.region ] .",
    "rather @xmath33 should be a quantity such as a bare coefficient function obtained from such a subgraph with a series of subtractions to cancel the collinear regions , i.e. , a quantity such as @xmath277    just like the pole part operation , @xmath197 , @xmath273 is not a linear operator , at least not on momentum space .",
    "nevertheless it obeys enough of the algebraic rules for linear operators that the proof of factorization still works if we replace @xmath79 by @xmath273 .",
    "the advantage of the use of @xmath273 is that it directly implements the zero - mass limit for light partons in the definition of the coefficient functions .",
    "it is necessary to add to the proof a verification that the zero - mass limit is only being applied to quantities for which the limit exists , at all stages of the proof .",
    "the verification is elementary , since the dangerous regions arise from regions of exactly the kind that are suppressed by the @xmath278 factors in eq.([subtracted.object ] ) .",
    "we can apply the same arguments to the renormalized coefficient functions as well .    in practical work",
    ", it is of course very important to take the zero mass limit wherever possible , since massless feynman graphs are generally much easier to calculate than massive ones .",

    "when @xmath2 is reduced below the mass @xmath1 of a heavy quark , the scheme described in sec .",
    "[ sec : large.q.proof ] becomes inappropriate .",
    "indeed , given a fixed value of @xmath25 , we go below the threshold at @xmath289 for producing the heavy quark by reducing @xmath2 enough . on the other hand",
    "the factorization theorem that we derived earlier has a non - zero subprocess in which there is production of heavy quarks in the final state , for any value of @xmath2 .",

    "[ fig : q.0 ] .",
    "there we replace a graph for heavy quark production by the lowest order approximation to the factorization theorem .",
    "the replacement of an off - shell heavy quark by an on - shell quark in the hard scattering enables the approximated graph to be non - zero , even when the true physical process is below the threshold for producing heavy quarks .",

    "the second observation is that when @xmath2 is much less than @xmath1 , the decoupling theorem @xcite applies .",
    "our heavy quark scheme will satisfy the decoupling theorem in the simplest way : one can simply drop all graphs involving heavy quark lines and obtain a correct answer without needed extra finite renormalizations of the coupling and parton densities .",
    "the method we will use is that of collins , wilczek and zee @xcite , with the heavy quark begin treated as non - partonic . in that subscheme ,",
    "renormalization is done in the @xmath3 scheme for all graphs except those involving the heavy quark . for graphs with a heavy quark loop ,",
    "renormalization is done by subtraction at zero momentum and with the light quark masses set to zero .",
    "the remaining renormalizations involve graphs with external heavy quark lines .",
    "following buza et al.@xcite , we define the heavy quark mass as the position of the pole in the heavy quark propagator , a definition that makes sense in perturbation theory .",
    "remaining renormalizations are defined by pole - part subtractions , in the @xmath3 style .",
    "this advantages of this scheme are @xcite :    * it satisfies manifest decoupling .",
    "* @xmath3 and zero momentum subtraction allow preservation of ward identities in gauge theories without the need for extra finite counterterms .",

    "* at no stage , in either this subscheme or the subscheme where the heavy quark is active ( or partonic ) , do we have to make an expansion in powers of @xmath4 or @xmath286 : the heavy quark mass need never be approximated .",
    "so the scheme can be applied when there are several heavy quarks and the ratios of their masses are not necessarily large .",
    "furthermore , there is no loss of accuracy when treating problems where a heavy quark is not heavy enough for it to decouple to high accuracy and not light enough for its mass to be approximated by zero .    in this section",

    "the second change is that we need to take account of the decoupling theorem for graphs with heavy quark loops .",
    "the first change means that eq .",
    "( [ 2pi ] ) needs to be replaced by @xmath291 where the subscript @xmath33 means that the amplitude with the subscript is 2pi only in light parton lines .",
    "we can formalize the definitions of @xmath292 , etc .  by defining a projection @xmath293 that is unity on light lines and zero on heavy quark lines .",
    "the projector onto heavy lines is @xmath294 .",

    "it should be remembered that at large @xmath25 , the physical threshold for heavy - quark production can be well above @xmath2 , and consequently the region where the two schemes have common domains of utility should then be appropriately biased upwards in @xmath2 .    when the heavy quark is treated as non - partonic , its parton density is not used in the factorization theorem , and one might suppose that the heavy quark density does not exist at all .",
    "in fact the heavy quark density does exist , because one can define it by exactly the usual operator formula , together with renormalization ( as dictated by the cwz scheme ) .",
    "the important fact is that the heavy quark ( and antiquark ) densities can be expressed in terms of the light parton densities by a version of factorization .",
    "this is a heavy quark expansion for matrix elements of heavy - quark operators in light states , and the argument was first given by witten @xcite for the case of local operators . in the subscheme where the heavy quark is non - partonic , the result is quite simple : the heavy quark densities are suppressed by a power of the heavy quark mass : @xmath330 we used this property in our derivation of the factorization theorem .",
    "let us now suppose that we have the most general case that there are several heavy quarks , whose masses may or may not differ greatly , and that @xmath2 can vary over a wide range .      in this situation , we define a series of subschemes , each of which is labeled by the subset of the flavors of quarks and gluon which are treated as active ( or partonic ) .",

    "if @xmath2 is comparable to the mass of a particular quark , we may freely choose whether the quark is partonic or non - partonic .",
    "gluons are light , so they are always partonic .",

    "thus renormalization counterterms are generated by @xmath3 pole terms , except for mass renormalization of heavy quarks , which is always performed on - shell , and except for graphs with loops of non - partonic quarks , whose counterterms are computed at zero external momentum and with the masses of the active partons set to zero .",

    "the methods used to construct the two factorization proofs readily generalize to show that the remainder is suppressed by a power of @xmath2 , provided that all the active partons have masses less than or of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , in the perturbative expansion of the coefficient function , if the @xmath3 scale @xmath19 is of order @xmath2 , there will be no large logarithms of ratios of @xmath2 , @xmath19 and quark masses provided also that the masses of the non - partonic quarks are all larger or comparable with @xmath2 .",

    "it is always legitimate .    moreover ,",
    "if one is computing the coefficient function for a particular external quark , then one can set to zero the mass of this quark and of the lighter partons , as explained around eq.([z1.def.heavy ] ) .",
