    "possible origins of ucds include the following hypotheses : 1 ) they are luminous intra - cluster globular clusters ; 2 ) they are extremely luminous star clusters formed from the amalgamation of stellar super - clusters that were created in galaxy interactions ; 3 ) they are the remnant nuclei of stripped dwarf galaxies which have lost their outer parts in the course of tidal interaction with the galaxy cluster potential ; 4 ) they are highly compact galaxies formed in the early universe .    here",
