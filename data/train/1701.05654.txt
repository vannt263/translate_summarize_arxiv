    "directed graph @xmath0 is a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) or acyclic digraph if @xmath0 does not contain a directed cycle . in this paper",
    ", we consider a generic optimization problem over a directed graph with acyclic constraints , which require the selected subgraph to be a dag .",
    "let us consider a complete digraph @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of nodes in digraph @xmath0 , @xmath2 a decision variable matrix associated with the arcs , where @xmath3 is related to arc @xmath4 , @xmath5 the 0 - 1 ( adjacency ) matrix with @xmath6 if @xmath7 , @xmath8 otherwise , @xmath9 the sub - graph of @xmath0 defined by @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 be the collection of all acyclic subgraphs of @xmath0 .",
    "then , we can write the optimization problem with acyclic constraints as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a function of @xmath14 .    acyclic constraints ( or dag constraints ) appear in many network structured problems .",
    "the maximum acyclic subgraph problem ( mas ) is to find a subgraph of @xmath0 with maximum cardinality while the subgraph satisfies acyclic constraints .",
    "mas can be written in the form of with @xmath15 .",
    "although exact algorithms were proposed for a superclass of cubic graphs @xcite and for general directed graphs @xcite , most of the works have focused on approximations @xcite or inapproximability @xcite of either mas or the minimum feedback arc set problem ( fas ) .",
    "fas of a directed graph @xmath0 is a subgraph of @xmath0 that creates a dag when the arcs in the feedback arc set are removed from @xmath0 .",
    "note that mas is closely related to fas and is dual to the minimum fas . finding a feedback arc set with minimum cardinality is @xmath16-complete in general @xcite .",
    "however , minimum fas is solvable in polynomial time for some special graphs such as planar graphs @xcite and reducible flow graphs @xcite , and a polynomial time approximation scheme was developed for a special case of minimum fas , where exactly one arc exists between any two nodes ( called tournament ) @xcite .",
    "dags are also extensively studied in bayesian network learning .",
    "given observational data with @xmath1 features , the goal is to find the true unknown underlying network of the nodes ( features ) while the selected arcs ( dependency relationship between features ) do not create a cycle .",
    "in the literature , approaches are classified into three categories : ( 1 ) score - based approaches that try to optimize a score function defined to measure fitness , ( 2 ) constraint - based approaches that test conditional independence to check existence of arcs between nodes ( 3 ) and hybrid approaches that use both constraint and score - based approaches .",
    "although there are many approaches based on the constraint - based or hybrid approaches , our focus is solving by means of score - based approaches . for a detailed discussion of constraint - based and hybrid approaches and models for undirected graphs ,",
    "the reader is referred to aragam and zhou @xcite and han _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    for estimating the true network structure by a score - based approach",
    ", various functions have been used as different functions give different solutions and behave differently .",
    "many works focus on penalized least squares , where penalty is used to obtain sparse solutions .",
    "popular choices of the penalty term include bic @xcite , @xmath17-penalty @xcite , @xmath18-penalty @xcite , and concave penalty @xcite .",
    "lam and bacchus @xcite use minimum - description length as a score function , which is equivalent to bic .",
    "chickering @xcite propose a two - phase greedy algorithm , called greedy equivalence search , with the @xmath18 norm penalty .",
    "van de geer and bhlmann @xcite study the properties of the @xmath17 norm penalty and show positive aspects of using @xmath17 regularization .",
    "raskutti and uhler @xcite use a variant of the @xmath17 norm .",
    "they use cardinality of the selected subgraph as the score function where the subgraphs not satisfying the markov assumption are penalized with a very large penalty .",
    "aragam and zhou @xcite introduce a generalized penalty , which includes the concave penalty , and develop a coordinate descent algorithm .",
    "@xcite use the @xmath18 norm penalty and propose a tabu search based greedy algorithm for reduced arc sets by neighborhood selection in the pre - processing step .    with any choice of a score function , optimizing the score function is computationally challenging , because the number of possible dags of @xmath0 grows super exponentially in the number of nodes @xmath1 and learning bayesian networks",
    "is also shown to be @xmath16-complete @xcite .",
    "many heuristic algorithms have been developed based on greedy hill climbing @xcite or coordinate descent @xcite , or enumeration @xcite when the score function itself is the main focus .",
    "there also exist exact solution approaches based on mathematical programming .",
    "one of the natural approaches is based on cycle prevention constraints , which are reviewed in section [ section_mip_formulation ] .",
    "the model is covered in han _",

    "@xcite studied mip models for minimum fas based on triangle inequalities and set covering models .",
    "several works have been focused on the polyhedral study of the acyclic subgraph polytopes @xcite . in general ,",

    "then , any arc in the lower triangular matrix can be used without creating a cycle . by considering all arcs in the lower triangular matrix",
    ", we can optimize @xmath13 in without worrying to create a cycle .",
    "this is an advantage compared to arc - based search , where acyclicity needs to be examined whenever an arc is added .",
    "although the search space of topological orders is very large , a smart search strategy for a topological order may lead to a better algorithm than the existing arc - based search methods .",
    "the proposed mip assigns node orders to all nodes and add constraints to satisfy property [ property_dag_topological_order ] . the iterative algorithms search over the topological order space by moving from one topological order to another order .",
    "the first algorithm uses the gradient to find a better topological order and the second algorithm uses historical choice of arcs to define the score of the nodes .    with the proposed mip model and algorithms for",
    ", we consider a gaussian bayesian network learning problem with @xmath18 penalty for sparsity , which is discussed in detail in section [ section_reg_network ] . out of many possible models in the literature , we pick the @xmath18-penalized least square model from recently published work of han _",
    "@xcite , which solves the problem using a tabu search based greedy algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is one of the latest algorithms based on arc search and is shown to be scalable when @xmath1 is large .",
    "further , their score function , @xmath18 penalized least squares , is convex and can be solved by standard mathematical optimization packages . hence , we select the score function from han _",

    "the proposed mip model has significantly less constraints than the other mip models in the literature , while maintaining the same order of the number of variables .",
    "the computational experiment shows that the proposed mip model outperforms the other mip models when the subgraph is sparse .",
    "the iterative algorithms based on topological orders outperform when the subgraph is dense .",
    "they are more scalable than the benchmark algorithm of han _",
    "@xcite when the subgraph is dense .    in section [ section_mip_formulation ] , we present the new mip model along with two mip models in the literature . in section [ section_fast_algorithm ] ,",
    "we present two iterative algorithms based on different search strategies for topological orders .",
    "the gaussian bayesian network learning problem with @xmath18-penalized least square is introduced and computational experiment are presented in sections [ section_reg_network ] and [ sec_experiment ] , respectively .    in the rest of the paper , we use the following notation .    1",

    "therefore , it is not practical to pass all cycles in @xmath37 to a solver .",
    "instead , the cutting plane algorithm starts with an empty active cycle set @xmath42 and iteratively adds cycles to @xmath42 .",

    "the algorithm terminates when there is no cycle detected from the solution of .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the cutting plane algorithm based on is that in the worst case we can add all exponentially many constraints .",

    "note that @xmath45 is not defined for all @xmath46 and @xmath24 . instead of having a full matrix of binary variables ,",
    "the formulation only uses lower triangle of the matrix using the fact that @xmath47 .",
    "we can also use this technique to any of the mip models presented in this paper .",
    "however , for ease of explanation , we will use the full matrix , while the computational experiment is done with the reduced number of binary variables .",
    "therefore , the cutting plane algorithm with should be more scalable than the implementation in han _ et al . _ @xcite , which has twice more binary variables .",
