    "the galileo positioning system poses a great opportunity , not only for the improvement and development of new applications in navigation monitoring and related topics , but also possibly for fundamental research in physics .",
    "indeed , together with the already deployed global positioning system ( gps ) and glonass , satellite navigation may be considered the first practical application where relativistic effects are taken into account , not from the usual experimental scientific point of view , but as a regular engineering constraint on the overall design requirements .",
    "indeed , effects arising from special and general relativity ( gr )  gravitational blueshift , time dilation and sagnac effect  may account to as much as @xmath1 , which is many orders of magnitude above the accuracy of the onboard clock deployed in these systems .",
    "moreover , the gravitational doppler effect , of the order of @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the newtonian potential , @xmath4 is newton s constant , @xmath5 is the earth s mass , @xmath6 is its radius and @xmath7 is the speed of light ) falls within the @xmath8 frequency accuracy of current space - certified clocks , and must therefore be taken into account . in the gps , this is done by imposing an offset in the onboard clock frequency , while in the galileo navigation satellite system ( gnss ) this correction should be accounted by the receiver . for further details ,",
    "the reader is directed to refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this said , it is not clear as to what extent the accuracy of the galileo positioning system may be improved  which is designed to offer pinpoint localization within an error margin of @xmath9 , against the @xmath10 margin of previous the gps ",
    "so to provide clues to the nature of models beyond the current gravitational physics knowledge ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for updated surveys ) . in this study",
    ", we aim to establish bounds on the detectability of extensions to the recently discussed unparticle extension of the standard model of particle interactions @xcite that manifest themselves through power - law corrections to the newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "these corrections are associated to the exchange of modes that do not correspond to particle states , usually referred to as _",
    "unparticles_. the exchange of spin-2 states lead to a correction to newton s potential usually dubbed as _ ungravity_.    this paper is organized as follows : firstly , we assess the main relativistic effects that are present in the gnss .",
    "we proceed and consider the possibility of measuring the discussed corrections using the gnss .",
    "assuming that all time - dependent effects are of cosmological origin , and hence of order @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is hubble s constant , one may discard these as too small within the timeframe of interest ; hence , one assumes a static , spherically symmetric scenario , posited by the standard schwarzschild metric .",
    "in isotropic form , this is given by the line element    ds^2 & = & -(1 + 2vc^2 ) ( c  dt)^2 + 1 1 + 2v c^2 dv + & & -(1 + 2vc^2 ) ( c  dt)^2 + ( 1- 2v c^2 ) dv  ,    where @xmath13 is the volume element , and @xmath14 is the gravitational potential . in the standard gr scenario , the latter coincides with the newtonian potential @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 multipoles account for the effect of geodesic perturbations and density profiles .",
    "to this picture , one must introduce the rotation of the earth with respect to this fixed - axis reference frame , with angular velocity @xmath17 ; by doing a coordinate shift @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one gets the langevin metric , given by the line element    ds^2 & = & -(c  dt)^2 + & & + 2 r^2 ^2ddt+(1 + 2v c^2 ) dv  ,    where , for simplicity , primes were dropped .",
    "asides from a non - diagonal element , one obtains an addition to the gravitational potential , which could be viewed as a centrifugal contribution due to the rotation of the reference frame .",
    "one can then define an effective potential @xmath22 ; the parameterization of the earth s geoid is obtained by taking the multipole expansion of @xmath14 up to the desired order and finding the equipotential lines @xmath23 ( the latter being the value of @xmath24 at the equator ) , and solving for @xmath25 .    in the above line elements , the coordinate time coincides with the proper time of an observer at infinity .",
    "however , since one wishes to evaluate the ground to orbit clock synchronization , it is advantageous to rewrite the metric in terms of a rescaled time coordinate , which coincides with the proper time of clocks at rest on the surface of the earth ; this is best implemented by resorting to the above - mentioned geoid , since its definition as an equipotential surface @xmath26 indicates that all clocks at rest with respect to it will beat at the same rate ; hence , rescaling the time coordinate according to @xmath27 , one gets the metric given by the line element    ds^2 & = & - ( c  dt)^2 + & & + 2 r^2 sin^2ddt + ( 1 - 2vc^2 ) d  .    finally ,",
    "if one gets back to a non - rotating frame , the metric is given by the line element    ds^2 = - ( c  dt)^2 + ( 1 - 2vc^2 ) d  .",
    "one may now consider the difference between the time elapsed on the ground and the satellite clock ; keeping only terms of order @xmath28 , one finds that the proper time increment on the moving clock is given approximately by    d= ds / c = ( 1 + v-_0 c^2 -v^2 2 c^2 ) dt  .",
    "considering an elliptic orbit with semi - major axis @xmath29 , and taking @xmath30 , this may be recast into the form @xcite    & & d= ds / c = + & & dt  .",
    "the constant correction terms in the above amount to + _ 0 c^2 = -4.7454 10 ^ -10  ,    for the gnss , and @xmath31 , for the gps ; this indicates that the orbiting clock is beating faster , by about @xmath32 , for the gnss , and @xmath33 , for the gps .",
    "for this reason , the gps has a built in frequency offset of this magnitude , while the increased computational capabilities made available to current and future receivers of the gnss leave this correction to the user .",
    "the residual periodic corrections , proportional to @xmath34 , have an amplitude of order @xmath35 , for the gnss , and @xmath36 , for the gps .",
    "the so - called shapiro time delay , a second order relativistic effect due to the signal propagation is given by @xcite    t_delay = _ 0 l c^3 + 2gm_e c^3  ln ( 1 + l r_e )  ,    where we have integrated over a straight line path of ( proper ) length @xmath37 .",
    "evaluating this delay , one concludes that this effect amounts to @xmath38 .",
    "also , one must consider the so - called sagnac effect , which arises from the difference between the gravitational potential @xmath14 and the effective potential @xmath24 , when proceeding from a non - rotational to a rotational frame .",
    "hence , one gets the additional time delay    t_sagnac = c^2 _ path r^2  d= 2 c^2 _ path da_z  ,    where @xmath39 is the ortho - equatorial projection of the area element swept by a vector from the rotation axis to the satellite . for the gnss ,",
    "this yields a maximum value of @xmath40 , while for the gps , one gets @xmath41 .",
    "one concludes this section by recalling the main effects affecting the considered global positioning systems : a frequency shift of order @xmath42 and a propagation time delay ( shapiro plus sagnac effect ) of the order @xmath43 . in what follows , one will compute the additional frequency shift and propagation time delay induced by ungravity inspired corrections to the newtonian potential , and compare the results with the above quantities , plus the frequency accuracy of @xmath8 and the time accuracy of galileo , of order @xmath44 , which corresponds to a optimistic spatial accuracy of @xmath45 .",
    "having studied the measurability of an array of hypothetical perturbations to the newtonian potential in a previous work @xcite ( including the effect of the cosmological constant , of a yukawa term @xcite and a constant acceleration such as the one reported in the so - called pioneer anomaly  see ref . @xcite and references therein for a review , and ref .",
    "@xcite for a conventional explanation ) , one now considers a power - law perturbation of the form    v_p = g m_e r ( r r ) ^n  , [ power ]    where @xmath46 is a ( possibly non - integer ) exponent and @xmath47 is a characteristic length scale arising from the underlying physical theory .    a power - law perturbation to the newtonian poses an interesting scenario for several reasons : phenomenologically , it provides a convenient alternative to the more usual yukawa parameterization of modifications to gravity , thus enabling one to probe potential candidates for extensions and modifications of gr .",
    "furthermore , some current proposals give rise to the existence of induced power - law effects at astrophysical scales . as mentioned ,",
    "corrections of this type arise from the exchange of spin-2 unparticles from which one can set bounds , for instance , from stellar stability considerations @xcite and cosmological nucleosynthesis @xcite ; in this context , the exponent is related to the scaling dimension of the unparticle operators @xmath48 through @xmath49 , and the lengthscale @xmath47 reflects the energy scale of the unparticle interactions , the mass of exchange particles and the type of propagator involved .    another relevant candidate for detection through a power - law parameterization",
    "is the so - called @xmath0 class of theories @xcite , which relies upon a generalization of the einstein - hilbert action ( including a non - minimal coupling of geometry with matter @xcite ) : in an astrophysical setting , these give rise to power - law additions to the newtonian potential , which may be relevant in the context of the galaxy rotation puzzle @xcite .    in the above eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) , the newtonian potential @xmath50 is recovered by setting @xmath51 ( for positive @xmath46 ) or @xmath52 ( for negative @xmath46 ) .",
    "the limit @xmath53 is ill - defined , since then the additional term @xmath54 does not vanish , but is identified with the newtonian potential , @xmath55 : this indicates that one should rewrite the gravitational constant in terms of an effective coupling , leading to the full potential    = g_p m_e r  ,    with    g_p = g 1 + ( r r_0)^n  ,    where @xmath56 signals the distance at which the full gravitational potential matches the newtonian one , @xmath57 .",
    "this additional length scale @xmath56 should arise as an integration constant when solving the full field equations derived from the fundamental theory of gravity beyond the considered power - law correction . for simplicity",
    ", this study assumes that @xmath58 , so that this may be safely discarded  at the cost of neglecting the regime @xmath53 , for which this condition fails ( notice that this is complementary to the approach followed in a previous study @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the subsequent section uses @xmath59 freely , albeit with the above caveat in mind .",
    "the relative frequency shift of a signal emitted at a distance from the origin @xmath60 ( for the gnss , @xmath61 ) and received at a distance @xmath62 is given by    & = & 1 - f_earth f_sat = 1 - = + & & 1 - + & & v(r_e)-v(r_e+h ) c^2  .",
    "hence , one may compute the additional frequency shift induced by the extra contribution to the potential , through    [ delta ] ( f f ) _ p & = & v_p(r_e ) - v_p(r_e+h ) c^2 + & & gm_e c^2 r_e ( rr_e ) ^n + & = & 6.96 10 ^ -7 ^n  ,    where a dimensionless ratio @xmath63 has been defined .",
    "one clearly has two asymptotic regimes : for @xmath64 , one may approximate the above by    ( f f ) _",
    "p = 6.96 10 ^ -7 ^n  ,    so that , considering the accuracy @xmath65 of the galileo constellation , one has @xmath66 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath67 , one obtains    ( f f ) _",
    "p = - 1.50 10 ^ -7 ( 0.22 ) ^n  ,    which , upon comparison with the accuracy @xmath68 , yields @xmath69 . since the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ is larger than unity , this imposes the rather strong bound @xmath70 when @xmath71 .    in the vicinity of @xmath72 ,",
    "one expands eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) as    ( f f ) _",
    "p = 1.07 10 ^ -6 ( n+1 )  ,    and the considered accuracy yields @xmath73 .",
    "the different regimes are depicted in fig .",
    "[ graphep ] .",
    "=      besides the relative frequency shift discussed above , a power - law correction to the gravitational newtonian potential also induces a modification to the propagational time delay , given by    t_p & = & 1 c _",
    "r_e^r_e+h gm_e r(r r)^n dr + & = & gm nc ( r r_e)^n + & & 1.33 10 ^ 6 ^n n ( 1 - 0.22^n )  .",
    "equating this to the @xmath44 time resolution of the gnss , yields the constraint    ^n | 1 - 0.22^n n | 7.52 10 ^ -16  .",
    "analogously to the previous discussion , for the extreme negative power - law regime @xmath74 this expression reads @xmath75 . since , for sufficiently large ( negative ) @xmath46 , the _ r.h.s . _ is larger than unity , one recovers the stronger bound , @xmath70 , obtained above .",
    "the allowed region for the @xmath76 , @xmath46 parameters is depicted in fig .",
    "[ graphdt ] .",
    "in this contribution , one has assessed the possibility of detecting signals of new physics through the use of the gnss .",
    "this application could be valuable , as any unexpected new phenomenology could provide further insight into what lies beyond the standard model of particle interactions and gr .",
    "one has specifically looked at the propagation time delay and frequency shift induced by a putative correction to the newtonian potential , namely one of the a power - law type .",
    "this study complements the one where the gnss was used to examine a constant contribution , cosmological constant induced and yukawa - type corrections to the newtonian potential @xcite .    as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ graphep ] and [ graphdt ] , one can not lift the degeneracy in the @xmath77 parameter space through an intersection of the relative frequency shift and propagation time delay observables , since these produce rather similar allowed regions for the mentioned parameters .",
    "asides from the obtained range for these quantities , the main result of this study lies in the exclusion of a definite range of values for @xmath47 , namely those lying between @xmath78 .",
    "recall , however , that condition @xmath58 leads to the limit @xmath79 when @xmath80 , yielding an additional requirement for the normalization constant @xmath56 in the case of a large negative exponent @xmath46 .",
    "also , the above results are not valid in the vicinity of @xmath81 , due to the lack of knowledge concerning the effective gravitational coupling @xmath82 .",
