    "as scientists gain insight into the `` nano '' scale in both the space and time domain , it becomes increasingly relevant to develop ultra - precise measurement devices .",
    "very prominent among those are interferometers , where the parameter to be measured is mapped into a phase difference @xmath6 ( or optical path length difference ) between two ( or more ) arms of the device . by recombining the outputs of each arm",
    ", an interference figure appears , which contains information about the parameter to be estimated .    the key quantity which describes the performance of an interferometer is its precision @xmath7 , often referred to as the sensitivity . in a typical interferometer , where the signal which is used to determine @xmath6 comes from a collection of @xmath0 independent particles , the sensitivity scales at the shot - noise level , i.e. @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the number of independent repetitions of the measurement .",
    "this expression tells that the sensitivity can be improved by either increasing the number of trials @xmath9 or the number of probe particles @xmath0 .",
    "a third way of decreasing @xmath7 is by replacing the uncorrelated ensemble of atoms with a usefully entangled state .",
    "non - classical correlations can be employed to beat the shot - noise limit ( snl ) and ultimately reach the heisenberg level ( hl ) , where @xmath10 , which for large @xmath0 can be a significant improvement over the snl @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic example of an interferometer which benefits from the use of entangled states is a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) , where the signal coming from two arms at the input is first recombined / split using a beam- splitter , then the phase difference is imprinted between the two arms , and finally another beam - splitter maps the phase difference into the intensities in the output ports . when the mzi is fed with an entangled spin - squeezed state and the phase @xmath6 is estimated from the measurement of the population imbalance between these ports , the sub shot - noise ( ssn ) sensitivity @xmath11 can be acheived .",
    "while originally implemented with photons , in recent years interferometers fed by atoms have attracted a lot of interest @xcite , and will be the object of the present work .",
    "these interferometers proved promising for the precise determination of electromagnetic @xcite and gravitational @xcite interactions .",
    "moreover , their performance can be improved with the recently created non - classical states of of matter @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a spin - squeezed state was generated by reducing fluctuations between the sites of a double - well potential , while in @xcite internal degrees of freedom were employed . in the experiments mentioned above , a two - path ( or two mode ) usefully entangled quantum state",
    "was prepared . in this work ,",
    "we consider instead a multi - path atom interferometer , involving more than two internal / external degrees of freedom .",
    "the idea that the growing number of modes could improve the performance of an interferometer has been first discussed in the context of optical devices @xcite .",
    "they involve the multi - mode version of a beam - splitters , and allow in general to measure a vector phase @xcite . in the particular case where the phase difference is the same between each pair of `` neighboring '' paths ,",
    "different methods have been used to derive bounds for the phase sensitivity . in @xcite , for an input coherent state , a momentum formula approximation allowed to predict a sensitivity @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the number of ports .",
    "this is a result of a multiple interference between different paths , and does not violate the hl @xcite .",
    "the gain is also robust against losses @xcite , differently from the improvement due to entanglement present in the input state .",
    "the scaling of the sensitivity with the number of modes and particles has also been heuristically derived for the specific case where coherent or number states are used in input @xcite .",
    "recently , the sensitivity for rotation measurements using a ring interferometer with ultracold atoms inside a lattice has been studied in @xcite .",
    "numerical determination of the ground state allowed to calculate the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) for specific states , which , as we will discuss in the following , provides the ultimate sensitivity bound , independently of the measurement and estimation strategy employed . on the experimental side , a multimode atom interferometer was implemented in @xcite , where a single bose - einstein condensate was coherently split among five zeeman sublevels using a radio frequency pulse .",
    "the relative phase between the atoms occupying different substates was imprinted with an external magnetic field .",
    "finally , the cloud was recombined with another pulse and an increased interferometric signal  with respect to the two - mode case  was observed .",
    "a multi - mode nonclassical state of ultracold bosons inside an optical lattice has also recently been created @xcite    in this manuscript , we consider a multi - path interferometer realized with a dilute gas of ultracold @xmath0 bosons trapped inside a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath1 lattice sites plays the role of a possible interferometric path , whose optical length can be modified by adding a spatially dependent force which would be then the object of our precision measurement .",
    "more precisely , for a potential @xmath13 , we derive the sensitivity for the estimation of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "first , using the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , we derive the best possible precision to be @xmath14 , independently of the quantum state , output measurement and estimation strategy .",
    "then , choosing a specific class of states which are symmetric with respect to exchange of lattice sites , we obtain the sensitivity @xmath15 for @xmath16 . here , @xmath17 is a two - mode analog of the enanglement measure , which can vary from @xmath0 for the superfluid state of the lattice up to @xmath18 for a strongly entangled state .",
    "note that when the potential @xmath19 acts on the system , one can naturally define a phase @xmath20 , which is related to the coupling constant , the duration of the interaction @xmath21 and the lattice spacing @xmath22 . in spirit of the two - mode interferometry",
    ", one can thus speak of the phase estimation , rather then determination of the coupling constant @xmath3 . throughout this work ,",
    "we use both @xmath23 and @xmath7 , and keep in mind they are simply related by @xmath24 .",
    "we finally consider a specific measurement and estimation strategy which could be applied in most of the current ultracold atom experimental setups : after undergoing the action of the force , the atoms are released from the lattice , form an interference pattern , and the parameter is extracted by a least - squares fit of the average density .",
    "using rigorous results from the estimation theory @xcite , we derive the sensitivity for this interferometric protocol , and show that it scales with @xmath1 in a same manner as in the case of the optimal measurement .",
    "the use of the spatial interference pattern , obtained through the expansion of the cloud , substitutes the beam splitter .",
    "the in - situ implementation of the latter in an optical lattice , in analogy to the double - well implementation , seems a much more demanding task .    the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ formula ]",
    "we formulate the framework for analyzing the performance of the multi - mode interferometers . in section [ abst ] ,",
    "we employ the notion of the qfi to provide some ultimate bounds for the multi - mode interferometry .",
    "first , in section [ abst_ult ] we identify the states , which allow to reach the best possible scaling of @xmath7 with the number of sites @xmath1 and linear potentials @xmath25 .",
    "then in section [ abst_sym ] , using the qfi , we show how @xmath7 scales with @xmath1 for states which are symmetric with respect to interchange of any two sites . in section [ nonlin ]",
    "we generalize these results for non - linear potentials @xmath26 .",
    "finally , in section [ fit ] we show how the scaling with the number of sites can be achieved for a particular detection scheme and identify the states usefully entangled for the multi - mode interferometry .",
    "some details of analytical calculations are presented in the appendices .",
    "we begin the analysis of multi - mode interferometry by introducing the quantum state @xmath27 of @xmath0 bosons distributed among @xmath1 modes .",
    "the most general expression for @xmath27 is    [ gen1 ] @xmath28    where the sum runs over occupations of @xmath29 wells .",
    "since the total number of atoms is set to be @xmath0 , the population of the @xmath1-th mode is determined by other @xmath29 occupancies .",
    "the coefficient @xmath30 is the probability amplitude for having @xmath31 atoms in the @xmath29 modes and @xmath32 in the last one .    for future purposes we introduce a shortened notation , where the set of @xmath29 indeces @xmath33 is represented by a vector @xmath34 , and the state ( [ gen1 ] )",
    "is written as @xmath35 the complete description of quantum properties of the system includes the @xmath1-mode field operator which reads @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is a bosonic operator which annihilates an atom occupying the mode - function @xmath38 localized in the @xmath39-th well .",
    "let us for now restrict ourselves to the case where a constant force , corresponding to the linear potential @xmath25 , is added to the lattice potential ( the more general case will be consider in section [ nonlin ] ) . here",
    "@xmath3 is the coupling constant - the parameter which we want to estimate .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the added potential , in the second quantization , reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the on - site atom number operator and @xmath42 , where @xmath22 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the external force interacts with the trapped gas for a time @xmath21 , which transforms the field operator ( [ field ] ) as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the generator of the phase - shift transformation @xmath46 equation ( [ ev_op ] ) shows that the perturbation imprints a phase @xmath6 between two neighboring sites , while the phase between the two most distant wells is @xmath47 .",
    "the interferometric sequence consists thus of a simple phase shift acting on the input state ( [ state ] ) and could be implemented as follows .",
    "first , is the preparation of the input state ( [ state ] ) in an unperturbed optical lattice ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "then the perturbing potential is suddenly turned on on a time scale shorter than the lattice hopping time , but slow enough to avoid creating too many excitations . in this way , the state does not follow the change adiabatically , and the evolution operator is @xmath49 . the goal of this work is to derive the sensitivity of the estimation of @xmath6 or , equivalently , of the coupling constant @xmath50 .",
    "given the interferometric operation defined by eqs .",
    "( [ ev_op]),([gen ] ) , the sensitivity @xmath7 still depends on : a ) the choice of the _ input state _ @xmath27 , b ) the choice of the _ measurement _ to be performed on the final state @xmath51 , and c ) the choice of the _ estimator _ , that is , how to infer the value of the parameter given the measurement outputs . in section [ abst ] , we will derive the _ optimal sensitivity _ , that is , assuming that both the measurement and the estimator are the best achievable .",
    "this can be done using the notion of the qfi .",
    "the latter allows to calculate the optimal sensitivity for a given input state . in sections",
    "[ abst_ult ] ,  [ nonlin ] , by further optimizing the qfi over all possible input states , we derive the ultimate scaling of the sensitivity . in section [ abst_sym ]",
    "instead , we restrict to a particular family of input states which are symmetric with respect to the exchange of two lattice sites .",
    "finally , in section [ fit ] , we derive the sensitivity for a particular measurement and estimator , using the familty of input states used in section [ abst_sym ] .",
    "as anticipated , using the notion of the qfi , denoted here as @xmath52 , we can calculate the sensitivity for the best possible measurement and estimator .",
    "once we know @xmath52 , we can indeed employ the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb)@xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath9 is the number of independent repetitions of the measurement used to estimate @xmath6 .",
    "the right side of eq .",
    "( [ crlb ] ) is the sensitivity optimized over all possible measurements and estimators .",
    "the qfi yet depends on the interferometric operation and the input state . for pure states ,",
    "the value of @xmath52 is given by four times the variance of the generator of the interferometric operation , in our case the operator @xmath45 generating the phase shift , calculated with the input state of the system and reads @xmath54\\equiv4\\delta^2\\hat h.\\ ] ] the qfi can be maximized with respect to @xmath27 and the upper bound for @xmath52 is provided by a simple relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the smallest / largest eigenvalues of the operator @xmath45 .",
    "the two eigenvectors of @xmath45 with extreme eigenvalues are    [ minmax ] @xmath57    by combining equations ( [ var ] ) and ( [ minmax ] ) we get @xmath58 .",
    "the inequality is saturated for the noon state @xmath59 for which , according to eq .",
    "( [ crlb ] ) , the sensitivity is bounded by @xmath60 this expression is the first important result : when the perturbation is a linear potential ( constant force ) , the best sensitivity reachable scales like @xmath5  a kind of `` heisenberg scaling '' with the number of wells . in section [ nonlin ] , we will derive the equivalent bound for nonlinear potentials .    as anticipated in the introduction , this scaling is a purely geometrical  and thus not quantum  effect . while the heisenberg scaling with the number of atoms @xmath0 originates from a macroscopic quantum superposition present in the noon state ,",
    "the scaling with @xmath1 is a result of an accumulated phase shift between two extreme sites , as discussed below eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) .",
    "our next step is to remove the optimization of the qfi over all possible input states @xmath27 , and concentrate on a particular family of states which are more relevant for current experimental setups with ultracold atoms .",
    "we assume thus that @xmath0 atoms are distributed among @xmath1 sites symmetrically , i.e. the coefficient @xmath61 is invariant upon exchange of any two indices .",
    "a prominent member of such family of states is the superfluid state @xcite , where each atom is in a coherent superposition , i.e. @xmath62 this state can be written in the form ( [ state ] ) with coefficients @xmath63 which clearly posses the aforementioned symmetry .",
    "another example is a symmetric mott insulator state @xcite , where each site is occupied by @xmath64 atoms .",
    "below we calculate the sensitivity @xmath65 using a generic symmetric state without taking any specific value of @xmath61 s .    to this end , we calculate the qfi using eq .",
    "( [ qfi ] ) and the phase - transformation generator @xmath45 for a linear perturbing potential from eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) .",
    "the average is equal to @xmath66 where in the last step , due to the imposed symmetry , we used @xmath67 .",
    "calculation of the average of @xmath68 involves a few intermediate steps , which are presented in detail in appendix [ app_qfi ] .",
    "the final result is that , for symmetric states and a linear perturbing potential , the qfi reads @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the on - site variance of the atom number .",
    "the value of @xmath71 can be easily calculated for some particular states .",
    "for instance , the uncorrelated super - fluid state ( [ sf ] ) gives @xmath72 , and as a consequence the qfi scales at the snl , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "a strongly entangled symmetric noon state @xmath74 gives @xmath75 , which gives the heisenberg scaling of the qfi , @xmath76 .",
    "these two examples suggest that for all symmetric states the on - site variance has a particularly simple form @xmath77 , where @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the above form of @xmath71 can be explained as follows .",
    "when the `` volume '' of the system  in this case the number of sites @xmath1  tends to infinity , the atom number fluctuations in one site tend to zero . on the other hand , when the whole system consists of only one site , the fluctuations are zero , since the number of atoms in the system is fixed .",
    "the only possible dependence of the variance on @xmath1 , which behaves correctly in both these regimes and also accounts for the scaling of the average value , @xmath78 , is thus @xmath79 . putting this into eq .",

    ". this would be the case  for instance  for the quadratic potential , i.e. @xmath100 . on the other hand , when the potential decays with distance @xmath95 , as is the case of the casimir - polder - type interactions which can exhibit the @xmath101 or @xmath102 scaling @xcite , there is no substantial gain from the multi - mode structure of the interferometer .",
    "this happens because already the phase imprinted on the second well , which is equal to @xmath103 , is negligible when compared to @xmath6 . in this case",
    "@xmath104 and by increasing @xmath1 the sensitivity saturates to the value corresponding to a linear potential and two wells , since effectively only the first well experiences the action of the perturbing potential .",
    "apart from the ultimate scaling , it is interesting to derive an expression for the sensitivity for symmetric states , as was done in section [ abst_sym ] for linear potentials .",
    "the derivation does not change substantially with respect to the line of reasoning presented in appendix [ app_qfi ] , with the only difference that the summations over the sites involve @xmath105 instead of @xmath39 .",

    "the qfi was used above to set the lower limit for the sensitivity by optimizing of @xmath65 with respect to the output measurement and estimator . below",
    "we demonstrate that the scaling of the sensitivity with @xmath1 , which is present in eq .",
