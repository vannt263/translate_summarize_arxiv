    "for a biological hybridization experiment , typically , single stranded dna is covalently bound to small probe spots on the surface of a glass slide , forming a so - called micro array .",
    "a solution containing fluorescently labelled sample molecules is then spread across this micro array where the molecules are allowed to bind to the respective probe spots .",
    "successful hybridization is usually observed as an increase in the fluorescence intensity on a spot . to have a reference , in co - hybridization experiments",
    "a two color coding is used .",
    "usually , such experiments are performed in sealed chambers to prevent the thin liquid film above the slide from evaporation .",
    "given the typical film thickness of less than 100 microns , the system exhibits a very small reynolds number , and the molecules in the fluid can only move diffusively @xcite .",
    "diffusion , however , is a very slow process . even for small molecules such as rhodamine",
    "the distance travelled in water after @xmath0 s is only about 1 mm . for relatively large dna molecules the diffusion driven displacement will be even smaller . on the contrary ,",
    "the binding reaction of complementary dna strands is a relatively fast process . especially in the case",
    "when the concentration of probe molecules on a spot is much larger than the one of their counterparts in solution , most of the molecules close to their binding partners at the glass slide will become immobilized after a short time .",
    "this can lead to the formation of a depletion zone with a lower concentration close to the solid surface . to reach the equilibrium concentration of bound dna , molecules have to diffuse through the depletion zone , which becomes the time limiting bottleneck for the hybridization process .",
    "typical hybridization assays are therefore performed over night or even over weekend , and then are stopped at some more or less arbitrary point .",
    "such experiments are also referred to as `` end point '' experiments .",
    "apart from the above mentioned non - equilibrium conditions , shorter hybridisation times also lead to a lower fluorescence signal intensities .",
    "quite obviously , this process can be accelerated if the molecules were to be actively transported along the solid surface plane .",
    "due to the low diffusion constant of large dna strands even a slow movement can speed up the hybridisation considerably .",
    "another aspect is that hybridisation is often conducted with more than one kind of dna with different fluorescent labels simultaneously .",
    "the fluorescence intensities of the different immobilized sample molecules are then evaluated quantitatively to interpret the results . however , when the dna binding reactions were not in equilibrium at the end of the hybridisation time , the results can be misleading .",
    "as the amount of dna available for a hybridisation experiment is often very limited one has to reduce the volume as much as possible .",
    "therefore , pump driven flow systems @xcite usually having large dead volumes are not convenient to induce the molecule transport during the hybridisation process .",
    "there are numerous other possibilities to actuate thin fluid films , amongst them for example electrokinetic forces @xcite @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we describe a novel technique to actuate a thin liquid film in a capillary gap .",
    "we employ surface acoustic waves ( saw ) propagating on the surface of a piezoelectric solid to induce acoustic streaming and mixing within the fluid . to understand the fluid dynamics in such a system , we concentrate on how the acoustic streaming transforms into a velocity field profile within a homogeneous dna solution in the capillary gap .    a surface acoustic wave ( saw )",
    "can be excited by the application of a radio frequency signal ( rf ) to an interdigital transducer ( idt ) on a piezoelectric substrate .",
    "the wavelength of the excited saw is defined by the geometry of the idt .",
    "typical displacement amplitudes of a saw are in the nanometer range , depending on the applied rf power .",
    "if the saw supporting surface of the substrate is in contact with a liquid , and if the saw has any displacement component normal to the surface , ultrasonic saw power is leaking into the fluid in form of an acoustic wave .",
    "therefore , this so - called leaky saw ( lsaw ) is expected to decay exponentially with distance from its source .",
    "the interaction between the saw and the liquid film leads to an internal , acoustically induced streaming .",
    "the reason for this is a net pressure gradient in the direction of the sound propagation in the fluid .",
    "usually , this leads to the generation of a fluidic jet , which can be nicely visualized employing a dye solution and a fluorescence video microscope .",
    "the captured images are evaluated in a subsequent image processing step , being a versatile tool for the interpretation of dynamic processes .",
    "this method yields real images of the observed sample as a whole , and therefore reduces the problem of a false interpretation of the data . for more precise measurement of the flow field and velocity ,",
    "we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) @xcite . in this method",
    ", the movement of fluorescent particles can be determined in the focal spot of a confocal microscope by evaluating the autocorrelation function of the intensity fluctuations .",
    "this represents the rate of particles entering and leaving the small observation volume .",
    "we assembled a special microfluidic arrangement to induce streaming in a narrow capillary gap between a glas slide and a plexiglass block , containing a saw device .",
    "m slit between two plexiglas plates ( 3x3 @xmath1 ) kept in the right distance with spacers .",
    "integrated in the lower plate is the saw chip , being connected to the rf source outside the fluid film .",
    "the transducer is located in the middle of the plate .",
    "images were taken with a video microscope from above through the upper plate.,width=317 ]     linbo@xmath2 chip with gold structures .",
    "situated on the right side is the interdigitated transducer(1x1 mm@xmath3 ) inducing the saw perpendicular to the long side of the chip .",

    "[ fig : setup ] gives a sketch of the principal setup as seen from the side .",
    "[ fig : chip ] shows the chip architecture .",
    "the width of the gap is controlled by spacers , it can be continuously adjusted down to 30@xmath4 m . in the measurements described",
    ", we worked with a spacers of 200 @xmath4 m .",
    "the saw chip consists of a 128@xmath5 rotated y - cut , x propagating linbo@xmath2 single crystal chip .",
    "the idt consists of 22 finger pairs , 0.85 mm aperture , and a period @xmath6 m .",
    "the idt fingers are thermally evaporated 300 nm thick au electrodes , fabricated by a standard photolithografic technique .",
    "the complete chip was protected with a 800 nm thick , sputtered silicon dioxide layer , which was removed at the contact pads to allow for electrical connection .",
    "the idt was driven with an ac signal at the resonance frequency @xmath7 , being defined as @xmath8 . for a saw velocity @xmath9 3800 m / s , the frequency @xmath7 is hence about 136 mhz .",
    "such an idt efficiently converts the applied rf signal into an acoustic wave , which in this case is launched as a bidirectional beam perpendicular to the fingers .",
    "if the capillary gap is filled with a fluid , switching on the rf power leads to a flow pattern as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : stromlin ] .",
    "the fluid is expelled from the transducer region to the left and right side and flows back to the idt from bottom and top . according to the high viscous damping the flow velocity decreases rapidly with distance from the idt .",
    "further investigations were focused on the characterization of the flow field .",
    "the issue of this work was to find out how the setup can be optimized for agitating a large hybridisation area .",
    "for this purpose we first want to discuss the nature of the observed saw - induced motion .",
    "the propagating lsaw couples to a sound wave in the liquid .",
    "because the sound velocity in fluids @xmath10 is always smaller than the lsaw - velocity in the solid substrate , sound is radiated into the liquid under an angle obeying snellius law of diffraction : @xmath11 this can be understood as a consequence of phase matching between the lsaw and the radiated sound beam in the liquid .",
    "this `` mode conversion '' leads to an exponential decay of the lsaw . in our case",
    "the observed damping in power was about 1dbm per wavelength , which is in good accordance with values found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this results in a decrease of 35dbm per mm . in the following",
    "we will give a short overview how the sound radiated in the fluid can induce a streaming force .",
    "sound travelling through a liquid is attenuated by the viscosity along its transmission through the medium .",
    "if the intensity is high , this attenuation creates an acoustic pressure gradient along the propagation of the wave .",
    "the gradient induces a force in the same direction that causes a flow in the fluid .",
    "this conversion of an attenuated sound wave into a steady flow is a nonlinear effect which is known as acoustic streaming . when a saw , i.e. a surface acoustic wave with a spatially constant amplitude , is in contact with a fluid the acoustic streaming is only a minor effect @xcite .",
    "much stronger is the streaming that results from the exponential decay of the lsaw .",
    "this decay causes the conversion into sound waves in the liquid within a short distance leading to a large gradient of the sound amplitude and consequently to a strong force that generates the acoustic streaming .",
    "here we do not want to go into the details of the rather complex mechanism of acoustic streaming @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we only mention that the effective force that causes the steady flow can be expressed in terms of the sound velocity field in the fluid @xcite : @xmath12 where the angular brackets denote time average that removes the fast oscilations of the sound wave .",
    "finally we note that the force is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "high force densities therefore can be achieved by means of high lsaw frequencies .",
    "on the other hand , lower frequencies lead to smaller damping rates of the lsaw and the force density acts on a larger volume . for an optimal design a trade off has to be found .",

    "this will be of primary importance for the motion in the @xmath62 direction because there is no systematic force in this direction and , moreover , the @xmath62-coordinate of the particle position strongly influences its lateral velocity . a diffusional motion in the @xmath62-direction averages over @xmath62 and results in an effective value of the constant @xmath122 which becomes smaller by the factor 2/3 .    in order to compare with the theoretical prediction of eq .",

    "the value of @xmath122 increases with the applied rf - power , see fig .",
    "[ fig : konstante ] .",
    "an extrapolation of a linear fit of the data , however , would lead to a spurious finite positive value of @xmath122 and consequently to finite velocities in the absence of driving .",
    "we therefore conclude that the increase of @xmath122 with the rf - power must be weaker than linear .     measured at different instants of time ( see also from fig .  [",

    "we applied fluorescence microscopy and fcs for the flow profile analysis of a saw transducer in a 200@xmath4 m thin fluid film . with the first technique the growth of the area of a fluorescein spot was observed . from this the flow speed in x - direction could be determined .    in the fcs experiments ,",
    "the flow speed in a homogeneous dispersion of fluorescent beads was measured at different points in a 5 mm wide channel . with this technique",
    "no limitations exist for the choice of the position where the data is collected .",
    "both methods yield a fast decay of the flow speed with distance from the transducer with a comparable rate . as a theoretical model ,",
    "the navier stokes equations were solved for an infinite fluid layer in the stokes limit of low reynolds numbers .",
    "the conversion of the sound wave into a steady flow was described in terms of body forces that were further simplified as line forces . because the actual spatial extension of the body forces is confined to a narrow regime this seems to be a reasonable approximation .",
    "the resulting flow field is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings . according to the theoretical prediction",

    "plotting this data against the actual position of the advancing front shows also a fast decay until the diffusion constant of the the dye is reached .",
    "this distance depends logarithmically on the rf - power and is about 8 mm for the maximum applied 158 mw in the microscope study .    when the flow speed is measured at different points in the streamlines with both methods , a linear behavior dependent on the rf - power can be observed .",
    "however , when the constant @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ xt ] ) is determined from the @xmath53 position vs time data for different hf - values , no line through the origin can be fitted .",

    "finally we address the question what one can learn from the presented experiments and theory in order to accelerate the hybridization of dna in a thin fluid film with the lateral size of a normal glass slide ( 75x25 mm ) . for this size ,",
    "diffusive transport becomes extremely slow and should be complemented by advected transport .",
    "the flow induced by surface acoustic waves can be efficiently used for this purpose . however , because of the rapid decay of the induced velocity field away from the transducer the maximal mixing range was found to have a linear dimension of about 8 mm in the present experiment at the highest rf - power .",
