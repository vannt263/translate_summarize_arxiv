    "it is becoming more and more clear that results from relativistic heavy ion collisions at many different energies@xcite show striking common traits .",
    "statistical - thermal models are able to reproduce particle multiplicities in a satisfactory manner by using a very small number of parameters : temperature , volume , baryon chemical potential and a possible strange - quark suppression parameter , @xmath4@xcite .",
    "we report here the results@xcite of an analysis of data from collisions at several different energies , with emphasis on the similarity of the colliding system .",
    "we have focussed our attention on central au ",
    "au collisions at beam momenta of 1.7@xmath0 gev ( sis ) @xcite , 11.6@xmath0 gev ( ags ) @xcite and on central pb ",
    "pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev ( sps ) beam momentum @xcite .",
    "as far as the choice of data ( and , consequently , colliding system ) is concerned , our leading rule is the availability of full phase space integrated multiplicity measurements because a pure statistical - thermal model analysis of particle yields , without any consideration of dynamical effects , _ may _ apply only in this case @xcite .",
    "such data , however , exist only in a few cases and whenever legitimate we have extrapolated spectra measured in a limited rapidity window to full phase space .",
    "the use of extrapolations is more correct than using data over limited intervals of rapidity , especially in the framework of a purely statistical - thermal analysis without a dynamical model .",
    "moreover , the usually employed requirement of zero strangeness ( @xmath5 ) demands fully integrated multiplicities because strangeness does not need to vanish in a limited region of phase space . + in order to assess the consistency of the results obtained , we have performed the statistical - thermal model analysis by using two completely independent numerical algorithms whose outcomes turned out to be in close agreement throughout .",
    "similar analyses have been recently made by other authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; however , both the model and the used data set differ in several important details , such as the assumption of full or partial equilibrium for some quark flavours , the number of included resonances , the treatment of resonance widths , inclusion or not of excluded volume corrections , treatment of flow , corrections due to limited rapidity windows etc . because of these differences it is difficult to trace the origin of discrepancies between different results .",
    "we hope that the present analysis , covering a wide range of beam energies using a consistent treatment , will make it easier to appreciate the energy dependence of the various parameters such as temperature and chemical potential .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , in the present analysis we use the most recent available data , concentrating on fully integrated particle yields and discarding data that have been obtained in limited kinematic windows .",
    "we have derived integrated multiplicities of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and proton in au ",
    "au collisions at ags by extrapolating published rapidity distributions @xcite with constrained mid - rapidity value ( @xmath8=1.6 ) . for proton and @xmath7",
    "we have fitted the data to gaussian distributions , whilst for @xmath9 we have used a symmetric flat distribution at midrapidity with gaussian - shaped wings on either side ; the point at which the gaussian wing and the plateau connect is a free parameter of the fit .",
    "the fits yielded very good @xmath10s / dof : 0.27 , 1.24 and 1.00 for @xmath9 , proton and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the integrated multiplicities have been taken as the area under the fitted distribution between the minimal @xmath11 and maximal @xmath12 values of rapidities for the reactions @xmath13 , @xmath14 for pions and @xmath7 s respectively ; the difference between these areas and the total area has been taken as an additional systematic error .",
    "the area between @xmath11 and @xmath12 amounts to practically 100% of the total area for pions and about 95% for @xmath7 s .",
    "we have not included data on deuteron production because of the possible inclusion of fragments in the measured yields .",
    "this is particularly dangerous at low ( sis ) energies where inclusion or not of deuterons modifies thermodynamic quantities like @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "+ the data analysis has been performed within an ideal hadron gas grand - canonical framework supplemented with strange quark fugacity @xmath4 . in this approach ,",
    "the overall average multiplicities of hadrons and hadronic resonances are determined by an integral over a statistical distribution :    @xmath16 } \\pm 1 } \\label{eqn : thermaldist}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is a three - dimensional vector with electric charge , baryon number and strangeness of hadron @xmath18 as components ; the vector of relevant chemical potentials ; @xmath19 the spin of hadron @xmath18 and @xmath20 the number of valence strange quarks in it ; the @xmath21 sign in the denominator is relevant for fermions , the @xmath22 for bosons .",
    "this formula holds in case of many different statistical - thermal systems ( i.e. clusters or fireballs ) having common temperature and @xmath4but different arbitrary momenta , provided that the probability of realizing a given distribution of quantum numbers among them follows a statistical rule @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath23 must be understood as the sum of all cluster volumes measured in their own rest frame .",
    "furthermore , since both volume and participant nucleons may fluctuate on an event by event basis , @xmath23 and ( and maybe @xmath24 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermaldist ] ) should be considered as average quantities @xcite .",
    "+ the overall abundance of a hadron of type @xmath18 to be compared with experimental data is determined by the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermaldist ] ) and the contribution from decays of heavier hadrons and resonances :    @xmath25    where the branching ratios br@xmath26 have been taken from the 1998 issue of the particle data table @xcite .",
    "+ it must be stressed that the unstable hadrons contributing to the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sum ] ) may differ according to the particular experimental definition .",
    "this is a major point in the analysis procedure because quoted experimental multiplicities may or may not include contributions from weak decays of hyperons and k@xmath27 .",
    "we have included all weak decay products in our computed multiplicities except in pb ",
    "pb collisions on the basis of relevant statements in ref .",
    "@xcite and about antiproton production in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that switching this assumption in au  au at sis and ags does not affect significantly the resulting fit parameters .",
    "+ the overall multiplicities of hadrons depend on several unknown parameters ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermaldist ] ) ) which are determined by a fit to the data .",
    "the free parameters in the fit are @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath4and @xmath28 ( the baryon chemical potential ) whereas @xmath29 and @xmath30 , i.e. the strangeness and electric chemical potentials , are determined by using the constraint of overall vanishing strangeness and forcing the ratio between net electric charge and net baryon number @xmath31 to be equal to the ratio between participant protons and nucleons .",
    "the latter is assumed to be @xmath32 of the colliding nucleus in au ",
    "au and pb  pb . + for sis au - au data we have required the exact conservation of strangeness instead of using a strangeness chemical potential .",
    "this gives rise to slightly more complex calculations which are necessary owing to the very small strange particle production ( au  au ) .",
    "the difference between these strangeness - canonical and pure grand - canonical calculations of multiplicities of k and @xmath7 for the final set of thermal parameters ( see table 1 ) turns out to be as large as a factor 15 in au  au at 1.7@xmath0 gev .",
    "+ owing to few available data points in sis au  au collisions , we have not fitted the volume @xmath23 nor the @xmath4therein . the volume has been assumed to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 fm ( approximately the radius of a au nucleus ) while @xmath4has been set to 1 , the expected value for a completely equilibrated hadron gas . since we have performed a strangeness - canonical calculation here , the yield ratios involving strange particle are not independent of the chosen volume value as in the grand - canonical framework .",
    "thus , in this particular case , @xmath23 is meant to be the volume within which strangeness is conserved ( i.e. vanishing ) and not the global volume defining overall particle multiplicities as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thermaldist ] ) .",
    "also , in order to test the dependence of this assumption on our results , we have repeated the fit by varying @xmath23 by a factor 2 and 0.5 in turn .",
    "+ a major problem in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sum ] ) is where to stop the summation over hadronic states . indeed , as mass increases , our knowledge of the hadronic spectrum becomes less accurate ; starting from @xmath35 gev many states are possibly missing , masses and widths are not well determined and so are the branching ratios .",
    "for this reason , it is unavoidable that a cut - off on hadronic states be introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sum ] ) .",
    "if the calculations are sensitive to the value of this cut - off , then the reliability of results is questionable .",
    "we have performed all our calculations with two cut - offs , one at around 1.8 gev ( in the analysis algorithm a ) and the other one at 2.4 gev ( in the analysis algorithm b ) .",
    "the contribution of missing heavy resonances is expected to be very important for temperatures @xmath36 mev making thermal models inherently unreliable above this temperature .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , we have performed two analyses ( a and b ) by using completely independent algorithms .",
    "+ in the analysis a all light - flavoured resonances up to 1.8 gev have been included .",
    "the production of neutral hadrons with a fraction @xmath41 of @xmath42content has been suppressed by a factor @xmath43 . in the analysis",
    "b the mass cut - off has been pushed to 2.4 gev and neutral hadrons with a fraction @xmath41 of @xmath42content have been suppressed by a factor @xmath44 .",
    "both algorithms use masses , widths and branching ratios of hadrons taken from the 1998 issue of particle data table @xcite .",
    "however , it must be noted that differences between the two analyses exist in dealing with poorly known heavy resonance parameters , such as assumed central values of mass and width , where the particle data table itself gives only a rough estimate .",
    "moreover , the two analyses differ by the treatment of mass windows within which the relativistic breit - wigner distribution is integrated . + a summary of the final results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : big ] . for each analysis",
    "an estimate of systematic errors on fit parameters have been obtained by repeating the fit    * assuming vanishing widths for all resonances * varying the mass cut - off to 1.7 in analysis a and to 1.8 in analysis b * for au  au at 1.7@xmath0 gev , the volume @xmath23 has been varied to @xmath45 and to @xmath46 ( see discussion in sect .",
    "2 )    the differences between new fitted parameters and main parameters have been conservatively taken as uncorrelated systematic errors to be added in quadrature for each variation ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the effect of errors on masses , widths and branching ratios of inserted hadrons has been studied in analysis a according to the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to be negligible .",
    "+ finally , the results of the two analyses have been averaged according to a method suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , well suited for strongly correlated measurements .",
    "from the results obtained , an indication emerges that a statistical - thermal description of multiplicities in a wide range of heavy ion collisions is indeed possible to a satisfactory degree of accuracy , for beam momenta ranging from 1.7@xmath0 gev to 158@xmath0 gev per nucleon .",
    "furthermore , the fitted parameters show a remarkably smooth and consistent dependence as a function of centre - of - mass energy .    the temperature varies considerably between the lowest and the highest beam energy , namely , between 50 mev at sis and 160 mev at sps .",
    "similarly , the baryon chemical potential changes appreciably , decreasing from about 820 mev at sis to about 240 mev at sps .",
    "however , since the changes in temperature and chemical potential are opposite , the resulting energy per particle shows little variation and remains practically constant at about 1 gev per particle ; this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eovern ] .",
    "+ the supplementary @xmath4factor , measuring the deviation from a completely equilibrated hadron gas , is around 0.7  0.8 at all energies where it has been considered a free fit parameter . at the presently found level of accuracy , a fully equilibrated hadron gas ( i.e. @xmath4=1 ) can not be ruled out in all examined collisions except in pb ",
    "pb , where @xmath4deviates from 1 by more than @xmath47 .",
    "this result does not agree with a recent similar analysis of pb ",
    "pb data @xcite imposing a full strangeness equilibrium . the main reason of this discrepancy is to be found in the different data set used ; whilst in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements in different limited rapidity intervals have been collected , we have used only particle yields extrapolated to full phase space .",
    "the temperature values that we have found essentially agree with previous analyses in au  au collisions @xcite and estimates 11.7 @xmath0 gev @xcite . + the @xmath24 value in pb ",
    "pb is strongly affected by high mass particle measurements , such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a recent significant lowering of the @xmath49 yield measured by na49 @xcite with respect to a previous measurement @xcite results in a decrease of estimated temperature value from about 180 mev to the actual 160 mev .    forthcoming lower energy pb ",
    "pb and high energy au  au data at rhic should allow to clarify the behaviour of strangeness production in heavy ion collision .",
