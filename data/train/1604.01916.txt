    "the critical behavior of antiferromagnetic frustrated systems is still a debated question forty years after the first studies of these systems @xcite .",
    "the key difference between frustrated and nonfrustrated systems is that the order parameter is a vector in the nonfrustrated case and a matrix in the other cases . when frustration originates from the geometry of the system as in stacked triangular antiferromagnets ( sta ) , the symmetry of the hamiltonian is @xmath5 for @xmath1-component spins and the order parameter is a rectangular @xmath6 matrix @xcite .",
    "depending on @xmath1 and the dimension @xmath0 of space , the nature of the phase transition changes , being first order for low values of @xmath1 and dimensions close to four and second order otherwise .",
    "one of the key questions is thus the determination of the line @xmath3 separating the first and second order regions .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath7 is certainly close to 3 and its precise determination is crucial to know whether the transition is first or second order for the systems realized in nature that are either ising , xy or heisenberg .",
    "numerical simulations of several frustrated antiferromagnets such as xy and heisenberg sta show unambiguously that the transition is first order for these systems @xcite .",
    "however , depending on the theoretical approach considered , the determination of @xmath3 varies much when @xmath8 and , as a result , it is not yet settled whether all @xmath5 symmetric systems undergo first order phase transitions in @xmath9 for @xmath10 . the two - dimensional physics of the xy and heisenberg systems is also debated because the relevance of topological defects is not yet understood , in particular the possibility that they trigger a phase transition at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the different theoretical approaches tackling with the problem of the calculation of @xmath3 can be roughly divided into two classes : the perturbative and the nonperturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) calculations .",
    "the class of perturbative calculations can be again divided into several different subclasses depending on whether they are performed directly in @xmath9 ( at six loops ) @xcite or in an @xmath11- or pseudo-@xmath11-expansion ( respectively at six and five loops)@xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the value of @xmath7 is systematically found larger than 3 ( of order 6 ) as it is also the case for the nprg calculations that find @xmath12@xcite . on the contrary , the perturbative calculation performed directly in @xmath9 at six loops",
    "yields a fixed point for @xmath13 and 3 and thus predicts that several @xmath5 symmetric systems should undergo a second order phase transition .",
    "recently , a completely different method based on the conformal bootstrap has been used to study matrix models in @xmath9 and in particular the @xmath5 frustrated systems @xcite .",
    "a critical behavior has been found in the heisenberg case with exponents in good agreement with those of the six - loop fixed dimension approach .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being unbiased by convergence problems since it is not based on series expansions , contrary to rg methods and , when applied to the ferromagnetic @xmath14 models , it leads to an extremely accurate determination of the critical exponents , at least when it is truncated at large orders @xcite .",
    "the situation of the nprg approach , that we re - examine here , is therefore the following .",
    "either the conclusions drawn from its results are correct and then both the fixed dimension perturbative rg approach and the conformal bootstrap are wrong or , conversely , it is wrong ( together with the @xmath11-expansion approaches ) and this implies that the approximations used are too drastic to reproduce the correct physics . in both cases ,",
    "something very unusual is at work because the methodologies that have been used in these studies lead in many cases to correct and accurate results .    as for the nprg , which is based on an exact rg equation , the approximations used so far to tackle with frustrated systems consists in performing a derivative expansion @xcite and a field expansion of the gibbs free energy @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind this choice is ( i ) that the critical behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat or the susceptibility for instance are dominated by long wavelength fluctuations which justifies expanding the correlation functions in their momenta ( derivative expansion ) and ( ii ) that the impact of the @xmath15-point functions with @xmath15 large on the rg flow of the zero or two - point functions should be small ( field - expansion ) .",
    "it is the aim of this article to eliminate one source of inaccuracy of the nprg approach , the field expansion , which is known to be inaccurate at low dimensions even for simple models such as the ferromagnetic @xmath14 models @xcite .",
    "the price to pay to get rid of this approximation is to work functionally , that is , to follow the rg flow of functions of the fields instead of a limited number of coupling constants . in the case of nonfrustrated systems , this is relatively simple since the @xmath14 symmetry implies that all functions involved in the rg flows depend on the fields only through the unique @xmath14-invariant : @xmath16 . for frustrated systems , there exists two @xmath5 invariants and the resulting flow equations are partial differential equations that are rather involved .",
    "we show in this article how to simplify the numerical problem and point out why the numerical difficulties are so severe at low dimensions that our method does no longer work when approaching @xmath2 .",
    "we provide the results thus obtained for the curve @xmath3 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "our results confirm what was previously found within a nprg approximation involving a field expansion of the potential and the @xmath11-approaches and thus contradict both the fixed - dimension perturbative approach and the results obtained with the conformal bootstrap .",
    "as the archetype of frustrated spin systems , we employ the stacked triangular antiferromagnets ( sta ) .",
    "this system is composed of two - dimensional triangular lattices that are piled - up in the third direction . at each lattice site @xmath19 ,",
    "is defined a @xmath1-component vector @xmath20 of modulus 1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given by    @xmath21    the sum @xmath22 runs on all pairs of nearest neighbor spins .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 for a pair of sites inside a plane and @xmath25 between planes .",
    "we assume that the interactions inside a plane are antiferromagnetic : @xmath24 is positive .",
    "the long distance effective theory for the sta has been derived by yosefin and domany@xcite .",
    "the order parameter consists of the @xmath26 matrix @xmath27 that satisfies @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",

    "can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are positive coupling constants .",
    "a typical ground state in terms of @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 , that is : @xmath45",
    "the nprg method is based on wilson s idea of integrating statistical fluctuations step by step . in this paper",
    ", we employ the effective average action method as an implementation of the nprg in continuum space @xcite .",
    "the first step is to introduce a @xmath46-dependent partition function @xmath47 in the presence of sources : @xmath48= \\int\\mathcal{d}\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}\\exp\\left(-h[\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}]- \\delta h_{k}[\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}]+\\boldsymbol{j}_{i}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the idea underlying the effective average action is that in @xmath47 only the fluctuations of large wave - numbers ( the rapid modes ) compared to @xmath46 are integrated over while the others ( the slow modes ) are frozen by the @xmath51 term .",
    "as @xmath46 is decreased , more and more modes are integrated until they are all when @xmath52",
    ". the function @xmath53 , which is the fourier transform of @xmath54 , plays the role of separating rapid and slow modes : it almost vanishes for @xmath55 so that the rapid modes are summed over and is large ( of order @xmath56 ) below @xmath46 so that the fluctuations of the slow modes are frozen",
    ". we define as usual @xmath57=\\ln\\mathcal{z}_{k}[\\boldsymbol{j}_{i}]$ ] .",

    "( [ eq : def=00003d00003d0000a5phi ] ) holds for fixed @xmath64 . from this definition",
    "one can show that @xmath65 where the cutoff @xmath66 is the inverse of the lattice spacing @xmath67 .",
    "equations ( [ gammakboundaries ] ) imply that @xmath68 interpolates between the hamiltonian of the system when no fluctuation has been summed over , that is , when @xmath69 , and the gibbs free energy @xmath70 when they have all been integrated , that is , when @xmath52 .",
    "we define the variable @xmath71 , called `` rg time '' , by @xmath72 .",
    "the exact flow equation for @xmath68 reads @xcite : @xmath73= \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\int_{x , y}\\partial_{t}r_{k}(x - y)\\left(\\frac{\\delta^{2}\\gamma_{k } \\left[\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}}_{i}\\right]}{\\delta\\varphi_{i}^{\\alpha } \\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)\\delta\\varphi_{i'}^{\\alpha'}\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)}+r_{k } \\left(\\mathbf{x - y}\\right)\\delta_{i , i'}\\delta_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}\\right)^{-1 } , \\label{floweq}\\ ] ] for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is generally not possible to solve exactly the above flow equation ( [ floweq ] ) and approximations are required in practice . in this paper , we employ the approximation of lowest level in the derivative expansion dubbed the local potential approximation ( lpa ) and some of its refinements .    within the lpa ,",
    "@xmath68 is approximated by a series expansion in the gradient of the field , truncated at its lowest non trivial order : @xmath62= \\int d^{d}\\mathbf{x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}_{1}\\right)^{2}+ \\left(\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}_{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]+u_{k}\\left(\\rho,\\tau\\right)\\right).\\ ] ] only a potential term @xmath76 is thus retained in this approximation which is accurate as long as the impact of the renormalization of the derivative terms on the flow of the potential is small .",
    "this is most probably the case when the anomalous dimension is small and @xmath77 .",
    "the next level of approximation consists in including in the approximation a running field renormalization @xmath78 @xmath79 this approximation has been used in @xcite where the function @xmath80 was further expanded in powers of the invariants @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is what we improve here to avoid any artifact coming from this field truncation .",
    "this approximation , that we call lpa , yields the one - loop result obtained within the @xmath11-expansion in @xmath83 and also , in the @xmath14 case , the one - loop result of the @xmath84 expansion of the nonlinear sigma model .",
    "although the situation is a little more involved in our case , it is very probable that the lpa is very accurate close to @xmath2 and our numerical results confirm this , see the following .",

    ", the anomalous dimension @xmath91 is obtained from the flow of @xmath88 since it can be shown that at criticality : @xmath92 the flows of @xmath93 and @xmath78 have been derived in @xcite and we recall them for completeness in appendix a. these flows are rather complicated and their numerical integration suffers from all the inherent difficulties of the nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "the first difficulty comes from the choice of variables .",
    "it is tempting to work with the invariants @xmath81 and @xmath82 defined above because the symmetry of the problem is encoded in the very definition of the variables and any smooth function of these variables corresponds to a function that has the right symmetry .",
    "however , @xmath81 and @xmath82 satisfy @xmath94 and it is not easy to deal with this constraint numerically because the domain where the variables @xmath81 and @xmath82 live is nontrivial .",
    "thus , we define another set of variables @xmath95 which is numerically more convenient . for any @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    ", it can be proven that there exists @xmath98 and @xmath99 such that the matrix @xmath100 , where @xmath26 matrix @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102 , becomes `` diagonal '' , namely , @xmath103 because of the @xmath104 symmetry of the model , we conclude that @xmath105 .",
    "this fact shows that we can parametrize the order parameter space using @xmath106 and @xmath107 , instead of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "this triangular domain is much more convenient from a numerical point of view than the parabolic domain @xmath94 for the invariants @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    at criticality",
    ", the @xmath46-dependent effective action is attracted towards the fixed point solution of the nprg equation once it is expressed in terms of the dimensionless renormalized fields @xmath111 and a dimensionless local potential @xmath112 .",
    "we thus define the dimensionless and renormalized quantities : @xmath113 the flow equation for @xmath114 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : flowu ] ) in appendix a. the critical exponent @xmath115 of the correlation length is obtained from the relevant eigenvalue of the linearized flow around the fixed point solution and @xmath91 from the flow of @xmath88 .",
    "the other critical exponents can be deduced from these ones by scaling relations .",
    "the scaled @xmath104 invariants @xmath116 and @xmath117 are defined by @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and the potential and couplings by @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "notice that as said above @xmath78 does not reach a fixed point but @xmath123 , defined by @xmath124 , does : @xmath125 at criticality with @xmath91 the anomalous dimension of the fields .",
    "from a numerical point of view , there are two possibilities for finding fixed points when they exist .",
    "the first is to dynamically integrate the flow . in this case",
    ", the problem is to find the critical surface which is usually done by dichotomy on the temperature .",
    "once it is found , the fixed point is ( approximately ) reached since it is attractive on the critical surface .",
    "the other method is to look directly for the solution of the fixed point equation ( coupled with eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) ) : @xmath126 .",
    "this is what we do here .",
    "the advantage of this method is three - fold : ( i ) the numerical scheme is much simpler than integrating the flow ; ( ii ) several numerical instabilities occuring during the integration of the flow are avoided ; ( iii ) the critical exponents are easily obtained from the diagonalization of the rg flow around the fixed point .",
    "we show in the following that although this scheme works very well in dimension @xmath9 , numerical difficulties appear in dimensions close to @xmath2 that make almost impossible to study the physics of frustrated systems in this dimension , at least with our numerical scheme .",
    "the basic idea of this scheme is simple .",
    "it consists in solving the fixed point equations for @xmath127 on a grid in @xmath128 space , taking into account the symmetries ( [ constraint ] ) of this space .",
    "we introduce a cut - off field value @xmath129 and consider the domain @xmath130 .",
    "we then discretize @xmath131 on a square lattice with mesh size @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the number of lattice points on the axis @xmath134 .",
    "the lattice points are given by @xmath135 for integers @xmath19 and @xmath136 that satisfy @xmath137 .",
    "we define @xmath138 to alleviate the notation .",
    "the fixed point equation for the potential is a differential equation .",
    "we transform it into a set of algebraic equations by discretizing the derivatives of @xmath139 .",
    "we give below some details about this procedure because all our numerical problems come from the boundary of the domain @xmath131 , precisely at the points where the discretization involves exceptional cases .",
    "the formulae for the derivatives @xmath140 for @xmath141 are constructed as follows :    \\(1 ) in the bulk region ( @xmath142 ) : @xmath143 and @xmath144 as well as @xmath145 and @xmath146 are computed with five points .",
    "@xmath147 is computed with the nine points @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the formulae are exact up to @xmath153 .",
    "notice that for points on the two borders of @xmath131 defined either by @xmath154 or @xmath155 , the derivatives of @xmath156 involve points outside @xmath131 . by using ( [ constraint ] )",
    ", we can compute these values of @xmath156 from those that are inside @xmath131 .",
    "this is one of the advantage of the choice of variables @xmath128 compared to the choice @xmath157 : the derivatives on the two borders @xmath154 and @xmath155 can be computed in the same way as in the bulk .",
    "\\(2 ) on the boundary of the domain @xmath131 corresponding to the large field region , @xmath158 , we compute the derivatives in the @xmath159 direction @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the same way as in ( 1 ) , that is , as in the bulk .",

    "finally , for @xmath173 we use twelve points in the region @xmath174 and the formula is exact at order @xmath166 .    notice that we have increased the precision of the derivatives on the boundary of the domain @xmath131 corresponding to the large field region in order to test the robustness of our results with respect to the choice of discretization and to try to reduce numerical problems when @xmath0 is close to 2 . in all cases",
    "studied we did not find any significant changes . in particular , the scheme is not more stable when the number of points chosen to compute the derivatives is increased .",
    "once the derivatives are discretized , the fixed point equation @xmath175 becomes a set of coupled algebraic equations for @xmath176 .",
    "we look for a solution to these equations by a newtons - like method .",
    "one of the difficulty of this method is the huge number of unknowns and the possibility for newton s method to get lost in the very complicated landscape of extrema of the set of equations to be solved .",
    "the way out of this difficulty is to deform continuously a solution of the problem .",
    "our strategy in this paper is to follow the fixed point potential @xmath177 by changing the dimension @xmath0 and the number of spin components @xmath1 gradually starting from @xmath178 and @xmath179 where the field - expansion method provides a good approximation of the fixed point potential .",
    "we use as an initial condition of newton s method : @xmath180 and @xmath90 .",
    "the parameters @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are determined by performing a field - expansion of the lpa equation on @xmath139 at order four in the fields and solving the fixed point equation for these parameters in @xmath178 and for @xmath179 .",
    "as expected , we find four fixed points : the gaussian and the @xmath184 fixed points as well as a once - unstable fixed point @xmath185 driving the phase transition and @xmath186 that corresponds to a tricritical fixed point .",
    "once an approximation of @xmath185 is found with the truncation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : field expansion ] ) , we use it as the initial condition of newton s method for the full potential equation ( supplemented by @xmath91 ) and we easily find @xmath187 .",
    "then , we move in the @xmath4 plane by little steps using as new initial condition what was found for the previous value of @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 studied . the fixed potential potential deforms smoothly and the newton s method always works properly this way .",
    "the line @xmath3 separates in the @xmath4 plane the region where the phase transition is of second order and the region where it is of first order .",
    "when @xmath1 is lowered at fixed @xmath0 , this line corresponds to the locus of points where @xmath185 disappears by collapsing with @xmath186 .",
    "there are two possibilities to determine @xmath3 .",
    "either we decrease @xmath1 at fixed @xmath0 and look for the value of @xmath1 where @xmath185 is no longer found and then repeat the same procedure by decreasing @xmath0 . or we compute the smallest eigenvalue of the flow around the fixed point @xmath185 corresponding to an irrelevant direction and look for the value of @xmath1 where it vanishes .",
    "this eigenvalue is a measure of the speed of the flow on the rg trajectory joining @xmath185 and @xmath186 and this speed goes to 0 when the fixed points collapse .",
    "this second method is much more accurate and less demanding than the first one and we therefore use it .    for each value of @xmath4 studied , we thus compute the eigenvalues of the stability matrix @xmath188 defined as @xmath189 where we consider @xmath190 and @xmath191 as ( super-)indices . since the rg time @xmath192 is negative , a negative ( positive ) eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath193 corresponds to a relevant ( irrelevant ) eigendirection around the fixed point .",
    "we sort the eigenvalues as @xmath194 .",
    "note that the above stability matrix around any fixed point solution has a trivial relevant eigendirection corresponding to the constant shift @xmath195 with the eigenvalue @xmath196 , which can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : flowu ] ) .",
    "hereafter , this trivial eigenvalue is omitted when we discuss the stability of a fixed point .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath115 is given by @xmath197 and the smallest positive eigenvalue we are interested in is @xmath198 .",
    "@xmath199    for each dimension @xmath0 and value of @xmath1 we have to make sure that our results are converged .",
    "once the choice of discretization of the derivatives has been made , there are two parameters that can be tuned : the values of @xmath129 and of the mesh size @xmath132 .",
    "the potential @xmath187 shows a minimum at @xmath200 and we have observed that @xmath129 should be at least 1.5 times larger than @xmath201 to get values of @xmath3 converged with an accuracy of less than @xmath202 .",
    "we have also observed that the smaller the dimension , the smaller @xmath203 must be to get converged results .",
    "this last point has two origins .",
    "first , at small @xmath0 the fixed point potential is steep at large fields because it behaves as @xmath204 and a small mesh size is necessary to accurately describe the shape of @xmath187 .",
    "second , if @xmath205 is too small , we find that even far away from @xmath2 , say @xmath9 , several eigenvalues corresponding to relevant eigendirections appear in the spectrum and spoil the degree of stability of the fixed point @xmath206 .",
    "these eigenvalues are clearly spurious because their values change considerably when either @xmath203 is decreased or @xmath207 is increased whereas the complementary set of eigenvalues , the physical ones , remain unchanged up to the sixth digit , see table [ eigenvalues ] .",
    "we observe that as @xmath203 is decreased , these spurious eigenvalues systematically disappear ( or , at least , get a very large real part which makes them highly irrelevant ) .",
    "the conclusion of this study is that for each @xmath0 , a sufficiently large @xmath205 should be chosen so that the set of first most relevant eigenvalues is converged as for their numbers and values .",
    "we find that in @xmath9 , @xmath208 is sufficient to get fully converged results while leading to numerically feasible calculations .",
    "we also find that as @xmath0 approaches 2 , `` large '' values of @xmath129 favor the presence of spurious eigenvalues that can only be eliminated by increasing @xmath205 .",
    "it turns out that around @xmath209 , very large values of @xmath205 , such as @xmath210 , would be necessary to avoid spurious eigenvalues and that decreasing @xmath0 would impose to increase @xmath205 in a prohibitive way .",
    "we have been able to compute @xmath3 down to @xmath18 by computing directly the value of @xmath1 where no fixed point @xmath206 is found with newton s method but we have not been able to go below this dimension .",
    "the crosses correspond to the calculation performed in this article either with the lpa or lpa. the two continuous curves correspond to the five - loop results @xcite obtained within the @xmath11-expansion resummed either by assuming that @xmath211 in resummation 2 or assuming nothing about the value of @xmath211 in resummation 1.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we have checked by varying all parameters ( @xmath212 and @xmath213 ) that our results are fully converged in @xmath9 from a numerical viewpoint both at the lpa and lpa levels .",

    "moreover , @xmath7 increases between the lpa and lpa and becomes closer to the results obtained with the @xmath11-expansion , which is expected .",
    "it seems therefore very difficult to imagine that @xmath7 could be smaller than 3 .",
    "let us also emphasize that the only monte carlo simulation that still finds a second order transition for a value of @xmath1 below our value of @xmath7 , that is , for @xmath216 , has been performed for @xmath13 by calabrese et al .",

    ", there is no doubt that such a large correlation length makes impossible to decide in favor of a second or a ( very weak ) first order phase transition since in both cases the physics will look the same at the scale of the lattice size which was at most 120 lattice spacings in the numerical simulations . we conclude that this monte carlo result does not contradict our conclusion that @xmath219 .",
    "this result shows unambiguously that if our result is wrong , the origin of the problem can only be found by including the renormalization of the functions in front of the derivative terms .",

    "we therefore suggest that it is useless to study the order two of the derivative expansion in these models that , most probably , would bring only minor modifications as compared to the present study .",
    "we also suggest that only the blaizot - mendez - wschebor approach @xcite , where the full momentum dependence of the two - point functions is retained as well as the full field - dependence of the potential @xmath139 could lead to a very accurate determination of @xmath221 .    as for the approach to @xmath2",
    ", we find a remarkable agreement between our results and what was found within the @xmath11-expansion .",
    "two resummations of the @xmath11-expansion were performed by the authors of @xcite , either by assuming that @xmath211 or by letting free the value of @xmath222 .",
    "this agreement is not very surprising because we expect the lpa to be accurate around @xmath2 for @xmath223 ( it is one - loop exact in the nonfrustrated case ) .",
    "notice that our results are not precise enough to determine unambiguously the value of @xmath222 although it seems clear that it can not be very different from 2 .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that @xmath224 and our results show that the @xmath206 fixed point must exist for all dimensions larger than two in the heisenberg case .",
    "since the nprg flow reproduces the low - temperature expansion of the nonlinear sigma model around @xmath2 , we conclude that the critical behavior of frustrated systems in @xmath225 is driven for @xmath226 by the fixed point @xmath206 corresponding to a critical temperature of order @xmath11 in agreement with mermin - wagner theorem . since we find no other once - unstable fixed point",
    ", we conclude that our study rules out the possibility of having a finite temperature fixed point in @xmath2 for @xmath226 contrary to what was found at five loops in a fixed dimension rg calculation @xcite .    to conclude",
