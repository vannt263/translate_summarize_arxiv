    "the enigma of dark matter ( dm ) remains unsolved . over the years",
    ", dark matter candidates converged to a variety of interesting and plausible candidates namely the _ weakly - interacting massive particles _ ( wimps ) @xcite . in general",
    "they are present in theories of weak - scale physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and give rise to appropriate relic abundance .",
    "calculations have shown that stable wimps can remain from the earliest moments of the universe in sufficient number to account for a significant fraction of relic dark matter density .",
    "this raises the hope of detecting relic wimps directly by observing their elastic scattering on targets . in the dark matter zoo many different types of particles",
    "have been introduced and their properties theoretically studied .",
    "still the most promising candidates are supersymmetric dark matter particles @xcite , although other non - baryonic candidates have been proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "if a fermionic dark matter candidate is subject to standard fermi interactions , lee and weinberg have shown that relic density arguments precludes a wimp with a mass lower than a few gev @xcite .",
    "however , it has been suggested @xcite , related to the integral satellite observations of the galactic bulge , that the gamma - ray emission line of 511 kev could be the product of light dark matter particles annihilating into positrons which then annihilate producing the observed gamma - ray radiation .    alternatively , many types of models that explore the physics beyond sm , share in common the presence of new @xmath3 vector bosons @xcite .",
    "these new bosons are introduced basically in two ways : ( i ) minimal coupling ; ( ii ) stueckelberg mechanism",
    ". a new vector gauge boson would be massless if a new @xmath3 symmetry should remain unbroken .",
    "this would imply in a long range force if it were to couple to ordinary matter , unless the coupling were incredibly small . as shown by dobrescu @xcite,@xcite this case",
    "would be allowed if the primary coupling were to a hidden sector and connected only by higher - dimensional operators or alternatively by kinetic mixing with the photon . in the case of kinetic mixing , this scenario would induce a small fractional electric charge for hidden sector particles @xcite .",
    "additionally , any new @xmath4 gauge symmetry must be anomaly free .",
    "an important issue is how these anomalies are ultimately canceled .",
    "the two main anomaly - cancellation scenarios then divide according to whether or not anomalies cancel among the sm fields themselves , or require the addition of new particles .",
    "these cases have been studied in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "numerous models describing possible physics beyond the sm predict the existence of narrow resonances at the tev mass scale .",
    "results of searches for narrow @xmath5 in pp collision data have previously been reported by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations .    in our present study",
    "we define a higgs - stueckelberg extension of the sm where in the dark sector one has a qed - like model which consists of a fermion singlet ( @xmath6 ) and a dark photon ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the connection between the dark sector and the sm is accomplished by an extra heavy gauge boson ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 couples to the sm by minimal coupling and to the dark qed - like sector by the known stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "this coupling renders some interesting features such as the sm particles are neutral to @xmath2 .",
    "if a dark qed could exist , independently , with a similar physical and mathematical structure as ordinary qed , what effects could it produce on sm particles ?",
    "the presence of an extra @xmath0 boson is crucial to establish a link between this new qed - like model and the original one incorporated in the standard model .",
    "there are many test grounds that could be explored , we shall investigate a simple energy loss mechanism in stars .",
    "in this direction , similar calculations have been performed in dense stellar matter , for white dwarfs and central protoneutron star ( pns ) in supernova scenarios .    in white dwarfs ,",
    "an extra cooling mechanism has been taken into account considering a very light dark matter candidate , the axion , originally introduced as an attempt to solve the cp violation problem @xcite . in supernovas , neutrino radiation , on time scales of tens of seconds , during which the central protoneutron star ( pns ) cools deleptonizes , and contracts .",
    "our calculation introduces an alternative mechanism for the energy loss which can be tested , in model building grounds and , in principle , could work together with the axion physics for white dwarfs and neutrino cooling in neutron stars .",
    "there is now a large body of evidence for the existence of dark matter that interacts gravitationally and makes up nearly a quarter of the energy density of the universe .",
    "although little is known about it , a possible framework for studying its properties is in a simplified model .",
    "many models have been proposed , sharing a similar structure : a standard model ( sm ) sector , a dark matter sector and the interaction between these sectors . in general , this interaction",
    "is called a _ portal _ , which is communication link among the particle sectors .",
    "in the literature , there are some extensively studied examples : higgs portal @xcite-@xcite , fermion portal @xcite , here we examine another possibility : a @xmath3 vector boson portal . the dark sector of our model is extremely simple , composed of a fermion @xmath6 and a vector boson @xmath7 .",
    "gauge invariance would require an extra higgs field for mass terms , which would introduce new unknown parameters .",
    "a alternative solution for mass terms , vector bosons and gauge invariance is the stueckelberg mechanism , where an unphysical field @xmath8 is introduced , but decoupled after gauge fixing . in this sense , the new boson @xmath9 can be defined in a hybrid coupling scenario : first @xmath9 couples to the sm by the usual minimal coupling , producing an enlarged gauge sector in the sm ( ensm ) , then in the dark sector , @xmath9 mixes @xmath7 via stueckelberg coupling .",

    "reports , the cdms collaboration has recently claimed to exclude a light - wimp interpretation of cogent and dama / libra observations @xcite .",
    "observations from xenon10 and xenon100 have been used to establish a similar rejection of light - wimp scenarios @xcite .",
    "recent results from lux ( large underground xenon experiment ) , have shown to be consistent with the _ background - only hypothesis _ setting a 90% confidence limit on spin - independent wimp - nucleon elastic scattering .",
    "a minimum upper limit on the cross section of 7.6 @xmath133 @xmath134 at a wimp mass of 33 gev is presented @xcite .",
    "similar to other xenon based experiments , the lux data is in strong disagreement with low - mass wimp signal interpretations of the results from several recent direct detection experiments .",
    "the mass of our  white dwarf wimp \" is far below the measured values in these experiments .",
    "in fact , for the energy loss mechanism , formerly described , to take place , the dark matter fermion singlet must be lighter than an electron ( @xmath135 ) . in a typical bhabha scattering ,",
    "for example , there should be sufficient energy in the annihilation diagram to produce , in the final state , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . by this argument",
    "these extremely light dark fermions should be abundantly produced .",
    "now , a simple comparison of the @xmath138 cross section with the @xmath139 annihilation cross section in the limit @xmath140 , ^2 , showing a strong suppression of @xmath6 production .",
    "alternatively , we have shown that the  supernova wimp \" has a mass range of a few gev , consistent with the claimed light - wimp candidates and resulting in an energy - loss of the order of neutrino cooling .",
    "this could be a promising path for future calculations .",
    "a unifying scenario where both neutron star constraints and white dwarf constraints are consistent implies in introducing two species of fermions @xmath113 and @xmath114 in @xmath141 with masses @xmath115 .",
