    "an ultracold fermi gas provides us the unique opportunity that we can systematically study physical properties of a many fermion system at various interaction strengths , by adjusting the threshold energy of a feshbach resonance@xcite . indeed , by using this advantage , the so - called bcs ( bardeen - cooper - shrieffer)-bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) crossover@xcite has experimentally been realized in @xmath3k@xcite and @xmath4li@xcite fermi gases , where a bcs - type fermi superfluid continuously changes into the bec of tightly bound molecules , with increasing the strength of a pairing interaction . in this sense",
    ", we can now deal with a fermi superfluid and a bose superfluid in a unified manner .",
    "recently , the spin susceptibility has become accessible in the bcs - bec crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas@xcite . here , `` spin '' is actually pseudospin describing one of the two atomic hyperfine states contributing to the pair formation . using this thermodynamic quantity",
    ", we can examine to what extent the spin degrees of freedom are active in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "theoretically , the possibility of the so - called spin - gap phenomenon has been discussed in the crossover region near the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2@xcite , where the spin susceptibility is anomalously suppressed by preformed spin - singlet cooper pairs . since preformed cooper pairs also cause the pseudogap phenomenon@xcite ( where the single - particle density of states exhibits a gap - like structure even in the normal state ) , the spin - gap phenomenon and pseudogap phenomenon are deeply related to each other in the cold fermi gas system .",
    "so far , the spin susceptibility has theoretically been discussed in a uniform fermi gas@xcite , although a real ultracold fermi gas is always prepared in a trap potential . in this paper , thus , taking this realistic situation into account , we study how spatially inhomogeneous pairing fluctuations affect the spin - gap phenomenon in a trapped unitary fermi gas .",
    "for this purpose , we employ the extended @xmath0-matrix approximation ( etma ) developed in the uniform system@xcite , to include effects of a harmonic trap within the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite . in a uniform fermi gas , it has been shown that etma correctly describes the bcs - bec crossover behavior of the spin susceptibility@xcite , which makes us expect that this strong - coupling theory is also valid for the trapped case .",
    "we briefly note that the ordinary @xmath0-matrix approximation@xcite , as well as the strong - coupling theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite , are known to unphysically give negative spin susceptibility in the bcs - bec crossover region , although these theories have successfully explained various many - body phenomena in the bcs - bec crossover region . using the combined etma with lda",

    "the pairing interaction @xmath14 is assumed to be tunable .",
    "the unitarity limit ( which we are dealing with in this paper ) is characterized by the vanishing inverse @xmath15-wave scattering length ( @xmath16 ) , which is related to the interaction strength @xmath14 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a cut - off momentum .    in lda",

    "[ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "thus , this suppression is not due to the simple thermal effect , but is considered as the spin - gap phenomenon originating from strong pairing fluctuations enhanced in the trap center near @xmath2 . indeed , in the spatial region @xmath64 , where @xmath43 is the position at which @xmath60 takes a maximal value , @xmath60 is found to _ increase _ with increasing the temperature .",
    "while this temperature dependence is opposite to the case of a uniform free fermi gas ( where the spin susceptibility monotonically _ decreases _ with an increase of the temperature ) , it is consistent with the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility in the spin - gap regime ( @xmath65 ) of a uniform fermi gas@xcite .",

    "to summarize , we have discussed magnetic properties of a unitary fermi gas in a harmonic potential above @xmath2 . including strong pairing fluctuations within the framework of the extended @xmath0-matrix approximation ( etma ) , as well as effects of a harmonic trap within the local density approximation ( lda ) , we showed that , near @xmath2 , the local spin susceptibility is anomalously suppressed in the trap center due to the formation of preformed singlet cooper pairs .",
    "the spatial region where this spin - gap phenomenon occurs becomes wide with decreasing the temperature .",
    "we also confirmed that the so - called universal thermodynamics hold for the spin susceptibility .",
    "we pointed out that , using this , we can determine the spin - gap temperature @xmath80 in a uniform unitary fermi from the observation of the spatial variation of the local spin susceptibility in the trapped case .    in this paper ,",
    "we have treated effects of a harmonic trap within lda , where spatial correlations are completely ignored .",
    "in addition , the present analyses is restricted to the unitarity limit .",
    "improving these issues remains as our future problems . since a real ultracold fermi gas",
    "is always trapped in a harmonic potential , our results would be useful for the study of how the spatial inhomogeneity affects thermodynamic properties of this system in the bcs - bec crossover region , as well as how to observe the spin gap temperature @xmath80 in a unitary fermi gas .",
