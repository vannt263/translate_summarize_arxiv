    "one of the fundamental problems in physics is the description of irreversible processes .",
    "irreversible processes are denoted by exponentially decaying observables associated with a preferential arrow of time .",
    "however , exponential dynamics of the wavefunction can be excluded from first principles in leading theoretical models , such as the hilbert space ( hs ) formulation of quantum mechanics ( qm ) . in this formulation , there are theorems stating that the solution of the schrdinger equation can not have an exponential evolution .",
    "@xcite    to explain damping , one introduces loss in a phenomenogical way , accounting for the coupling with the environment.@xcite however , exponential time decay of observable quantities , which signals irreversible dynamics , is routinely detected in experiments , even when the role of the environment is negligible .",
    "this is known as the _ probability problem _ and is common to quantum and classical systems .",
    "@xcite    a paradigmatic example of the issues related to irreversibility in classical systems is found in nonlinear wave propagation . in regimes allowing for shock waves , singular solutions may be excited by smooth initial conditions that generate an evolution dominated by non - regular , highly disordered , waves ( wave - breaking ) .",
    "@xcite the evolution of smooth initial conditions towards a highly disordered and incoherent regime is intuitive .",
    "however , the reverse process , albeit possible , is strongly puzzling , and against well accepted ideas about entropy .",
    "dispersive shock waves ( dsw ) and wave - breaking in hamiltonian models therefore question reversibility .",
    "they seem to indicate a preferential arrow of time that should be excluded from first principles , because no coupling with the environment is foreseen .",
    "@xcite    here we pose the following question : is there a connection between shock waves and the problem of the irreversibility of the wavefunction ?",
    "these two problems are seemingly unrelated , but if one carefully looks at the dynamics of a shock wave ( as detailed below ) , one realizes that exponential dynamics can be identified .",
    "we show in the following that the specific case of a nonlocal nonlinearity enables to unveil the link and lay the foundations for further developments .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is that one can circumvent the absence of exponentially decaying solution for the wavefunction by enlarging the hilbert space for including non - normalizable wavefunctions that decay exponentially in evolution .",
    "this is known as the rigged hilbert space ( rhs ) formulation of quantum @xcite and classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "exponential dynamics are explained in terms of the excitation of states with complex energy eigenvalues .",
    "these states , known as gamow vectors ( gvs ) , were originally introduced in nuclear physics , and model irreversibility in hamiltonian systems . @xcite",
    "even if gv are not - normalizable , they can be used as a generalized basis , as it happens , e.g. , for plane waves .",
    "however , the watermark of gv is a quantized decay rate .",
    "this quantization is radically different from the standard quantization of real eigenvalues , and involve the imaginary part of the gv eigenvalues .",
    "notably enough , so far , no experimental evidence of the quantization of decay rates has been reported .",
    "we also remark that this has nothing to do with quantum many - body theory , or out - of - equilibrium systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this manuscript",
    ", we show that gv can be introduced to describe highly nonlinear regimes in nonlocal media .",
    "we show that the solution of the relevant nonlinear schroedinger equation in the presence of shock waves can be given in terms of gv with power - dependent , quantized decay rates .",
    "gv are shown to quantitatively describe shock waves , in terms of the amplitude and the phase of the complex wavefunction and they explain the observed exponential dynamics .",
    "we also demonstrate that the excitation of gv radically changes the degree of irreversibility of the dynamics .",
    "specifically , the theoretical tools arising from the use of gv enable to explicitily consider and calculate the degree of irreversibility , defined as the difference between the forward and the backward propagated wavefunction .",
    "this calculation is found to be in quantitative agreement with numerical solutions , and shows that even an arbitrary small amount of loss produces a breaking of time - reversal enhanced by shock waves .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : in section [ sec : nonloc ] we introduce the leading model ; in section [ sec : gvexp ] we introduce gvs and the resulting expansion ; the specific case of the reversed harmonic oscillator is analyzed in section [ sec : ro ] ; section [ sec : nonlocalsolitons ] describes the link between the ground state gv , shock waves and nonlocal solitons ; section [ sec : decays ] describes the exponentially decaying dynamics ; section [ sec : irrev ] deals with the definition of the degree of irreversibility and the way it can be calculated by the gv expansion , quantitative comparison with numerical simulations is also reported ; conclusions are drawn in [ sec : conc ] .",
