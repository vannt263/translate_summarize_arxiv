    "actions of lovelock gravity and born - infeld electrodynamics have been the subject of wide interest in recent years .",

    "string theories in their low - energy limit give rise to effective models of gravity in higher dimensions which involve higher curvature terms , while on the electrodynamics side the effective action for the open string ending on d - branes can be written in a born - infeld form . while lovelock gravity @xcite was proposed to have field equations with at most second order derivatives of the metric @xcite , the nonlinear electrodynamics was proposed , by born and infeld , with the aim of obtaining a finite value for the self - energy of a pointlike charge @xcite .",
    "lovelock gravity reduces to einstein gravity in four dimensions and also in the weak field limit , while the lagrangian of the born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics reduces to the maxwell lagrangian in the weak field limit .",
    "there have been considerable works on both of these theories . in lovelock gravity ,",
    "there have been some attempts for understanding the role of the higher curvature terms from various points of view .",
    "for example , exact static spherically symmetric black hole solutions of the second order lovelock gravity have been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and of the gauss - bonnet - maxwell model in ref .",
    "an exact static solution in third order lovelock gravity was introduced in ref . @xcite and of the charged rotating black brane solution in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the magnetic solutions with longitudinal and angular magnetic field were considered in ref .",
    "all of these works were in the presence of a linear electromagnetic field . the first attempt to relate the",
    "nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity has been done by hoffmann @xcite .",
    "he obtained a solution of the einstein equations for a pointlike born - infeld charge , which is devoid of the divergence of the metric at the origin that characterizes the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "however , a conical singularity remained there , as it was later objected by einstein and rosen .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions in einstein - born - infeld gravity with or without a cosmological constant have been considered by many authors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are dealing with the issue of the spacetimes generated by static and spinning brane sources which are horizonless and have non - trivial external solutions .",
    "these kinds of solutions have been investigated by many authors in four dimensions .",
    "static uncharged cylindrically symmetric solutions of einstein gravity in four dimensions were considered in ref .",
    "similar static solutions in the context of cosmic string theory were found in ref .",
    "all of these solutions @xcite are horizonless and have a conical geometry ; they are everywhere flat except at the location of the line source .",

    "@xcite , while those of brans - dicke gravity have been considered in ref .",
    "the generalization of these solutions in einstein gravity in the presence of a dilaton and born - infeld electromagnetic field has been done in ref .",
    "our aim in this paper is to construct @xmath0-dimensional horizonless solutions of third order lovelock gravity in the presence of a nonlinear electromagnetic field and investigate the effects of the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field on the properties of the spacetime such as the deficit angle of the spacetime .",
    "the first reason for studying higher - dimensional solutions of gravity , which invite higher order lovelock terms , is due to the scenario of string theory and brane cosmology .",
    "the idea of brane cosmology , which is also consistent with string theory , suggests that matter and gauge interaction ( described by an open string ) may be localized on a brane embedded into a higher - dimensional spacetime , and all gravitational objects are higher - dimensional @xcite .",
    "the second reason for studying higher - dimensional solutions is the fact that four - dimensional solutions have a number of remarkable properties .",
    "it is natural to ask whether these properties are general features of the solutions or whether they crucially depend on the world being four - dimensional .",
    "finally , we want to check whether the counterterm method introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite can be applied to the case of solutions in the presence of a nonlinear electromagnetic field , too .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we give a brief review of the field equations of lovelock gravity in the presence of a born - infeld electromagnetic field in sec .",

    "[ long ] we present static horizonless solutions which produce a longitudinal magnetic field and investigate the effects of the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field and lovelock terms on the deficit angle of the spacetime .",

    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "a natural generalization of general relativity in higher - dimensional spacetimes with the assumption of einstein , that the left - hand side of the field equations is the most general symmetric conserved tensor containing no more than second derivatives of the metric , is lovelock theory .",
    "lovelock found the most general symmetric conserved tensor satisfying this property .",
    "the resultant tensor is nonlinear in the riemann tensor and differs from the einstein tensor only if the spacetime has more than 4 dimensions .",
    "the lovelock tensor in @xmath0 dimensions may be written as @xcite @xmath2}\\alpha'_{i}[h_{\\mu \\nu } ^{(i)}-\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu \\nu } % { \\cal l}^{(i)}]+\\lambda g_{\\mu \\nu } = 8\\pi t_{\\mu \\nu } ,   \\label{ff}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant for asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) solutions , @xmath4 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 s for @xmath8 are lovelock coefficients , @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12    in this paper , we consider up to third order lovelock terms .",
    "the first term is just the einstein tensor , and the second and third terms are gauss - bonnet and third order lovelock tensors , respectively , which are written in terms of riemann tensor explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the presence of a born - infeld electromagnetic field , the energy - momentum tensor of eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the nonlinear electromagnetic field tensor which satisfies the bi equation @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is called the born - infeld parameter which has the dimension of @xmath18 , and , as it goes to @xmath19 , the bi equation reduces to the standard maxwell equation .",
    "here we want to obtain the @xmath0-dimensional solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ ff]-[bi ] ) which produce longitudinal magnetic fields in the euclidean submanifold spans by @xmath20  coordinates ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we will work with the following ansatz for the metric @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the euclidean metric on the @xmath24-dimensional submanifold .",
    "the angular coordinate @xmath25 is dimensionless as usual and ranges in @xmath26 $ ] , while @xmath20 s range in @xmath27 .",
    "the motivation for this metric gauge @xmath28 and @xmath29 $ ] instead of the usual schwarzschild gauge @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] comes from the fact that we are looking for a horizonless solution .",
    "the electromagnetic field equation ( [ bi ] ) can be integrated immediately to give @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the charge parameter of the solution and @xmath34 equation ( [ fpr ] ) shows that @xmath35  should be greater than @xmath36  in order to have a real nonlinear electromagnetic field and consequently a real spacetime . to find the function @xmath37",
    ", one may use any components of eq .",

    "using the fact that @xmath46,[c],z)$ ] has a convergent series expansion for @xmath47 , we can find the behavior of the metric for large @xmath35  and @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath48 approaches the constant @xmath49 as @xmath35 goes to infinity , and the effective cosmological constant for the spacetime is @xmath50 in the rest of the paper , we investigate only the case of @xmath51 , for which @xmath37 is real .",
    "the function @xmath52 is negative for large values of @xmath35 , if @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related by @xmath56 , when @xmath54 becomes negative ( which occurs for large @xmath57 ) , so does @xmath55 .",
    "this leads to an apparent change of signature of the metric from @xmath58 to @xmath59 as @xmath35 goes to infinity , which is not allowed .",
    "thus , @xmath60 should be negative which occurs provided the lovelock coefficients are assumed to be positive .    in order to study the general structure of the solution given in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , we first look for curvature singularities . it is easy to show that the kretschmann scalar @xmath61 diverges at @xmath62 , and therefore one might think that there is a curvature singularity located at @xmath62 .",

    "the function @xmath37 is negative for @xmath63 and positive for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the largest real root of @xmath66 which reduces to @xmath67 again @xmath54 can not be negative ( which occurs for @xmath68 ) , because of the change of signature of the metric from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "thus , one can not extend the spacetime to @xmath69 . to get rid of this incorrect extension ,",

    "\\label{mu}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , @xmath87 is the value of the second derivative of @xmath76 at @xmath80 , which can be calculated as @xmath88 where @xmath89 . by the above analysis",
    ", one concludes that near the origin @xmath80 the metric ( [ metr1b ] ) may be written as @xmath90\\label{defi}.\\ ] ] this metric describes a spacetime that is locally flat but has a conical singularity at @xmath80 with a deficit angle @xmath91 , which is proportional to the brane tension at @xmath80 @xcite . of course , one may ask for the completeness of the spacetime with @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the spacetime described by eq .",
    "( [ metr1b ] ) is both null and timelike geodesically complete as in the case of four - dimensional solutions @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can show that every null or timelike geodesic starting from an arbitrary point can either extend to infinite values of the affine parameter along the geodesic or end on a singularity at @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "now we investigate the effects of different parameters of the solution on the deficit angle of the spacetime .",
    "first , we investigate the effect of the nonlinearity of the magnetic field on the deficit angle . in order to do this , we plot @xmath1 versus the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which shows that as @xmath94 decreases ( the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field becomes more evident ) the deficit angle increases . since for fixed values of mass , charge , and the cosmological",
    "constant the parameter @xmath17 has a minimum value which can be evaluated by the fact that @xmath95 , the deficit angle starts from a maximum value @xmath96 for @xmath97 and goes to its minimum value as @xmath17 goes to infinity .",
    "second , we consider the effect of lovelock terms on the deficit angle in the following subsection .",
    "as two special cases , we introduce the static magnetic solutions of einstein and gauss - bonnet gravity in the presence of a born - infeld electromagnetic field .",
    "the first special case is when both of the lovelock coefficients are zero . solving eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) in the case of @xmath98 and performing the transformation ( [ tr1 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is given by eq .",

    "( [ f2 ] ) as @xmath102 and @xmath103 go to zero .    as the second special case , we introduce the magnetic solution in gauss - bonnet gravity which may be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) in the case of @xmath104 and performing the transformation ( [ tr1 ] ) . in this case , one obtains @xmath105 where again @xmath100 and @xmath106 are the same as that of einstein or lovelock gravities .",
    "now , we investigate the effects of lovelock terms on the properties of the spacetime such as the deficit angle . according to eq .",
    "( [ defi ] ) , the deficit angle depends on @xmath89 and @xmath106 , which are the same for einstein , gauss - bonnet and third order lovelock gravities and are independent of lovelock coefficients .",
    "thus , one may expect that lovelock terms of any order have no effect on the properties of our spacetime , which is a warped product of an ( @xmath107)-dimensional zero - curvature spacetime and a curved two - dimensional space . in this relation",
    ", we will give some comments in the last section .",
    "now , we want to endow our spacetime solution ( [ met1a ] ) with a global rotation . it should be mentioned that the ( @xmath108const . , @xmath109const.)-boundary of our spacetime is curvature - free and therefore this solution is not a counterpart of the kerr - type solution in lovelock gravity .",
    "we first consider the solutions with one rotation parameter . in order to add angular momentum to the spacetime",

    "therefore , the metrics ( [ met1a ] ) and ( [ met2a ] ) can be locally mapped into each other but not globally , and so they are distinct .",
    "again , this spacetime has no horizon and curvature singularity .",
    "however , it has a conical singularity at @xmath80 .",

    "( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the nonvanishing components of the electromagnetic field tensor are @xmath127    in the remaining part of this section , we compute the conserved quantities of the solution . in general , the conserved quantities are divergent when evaluated on the solutions .",
    "a systematic method of dealing with this divergence for asymptotically ads solutions of einstein gravity is through the use of the counterterms method inspired by the anti - de sitter conformal field theory correspondence @xcite . for asymptotically ads solutions of lovelock gravity with flat boundary @xmath128 ,",

    "this class of solutions yields an @xmath0-dimensional spacetime with a longitudinal nonlinear magnetic field [ the only nonzero component of the vector potential is @xmath166 generated by a static magnetic brane .",
    "we found that these solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizons , but have conic singularity at @xmath80 with a deficit angle @xmath1 which is sensitive to the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we found that as the effects of the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic fields become larger , the deficit angle increases . in these static spacetimes , the electric field vanishes , and",
    "therefore the brane has no net electric charge .",
    "next , we endow the spacetime with rotation . for the spinning brane , when the rotation parameters are nonzero , the brane has a net electric charge density which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameters given by @xmath167 .",
    "we also applied the counterterm method in order to calculate the conserved quantities of the spacetime and found that these conserved quantities do not depend on the born - infeld parameter @xmath17 .",

    "this also happens for the mass , angular momenta and charge given by eqs .",
    "( [ mas ] ) , ( [ ang ] ) and ( [ charge ] ) .",
    "this feature of our solution is a generic property of any kind of solutions of any order of lovelock gravity for spacetimes which are warped products of an ( @xmath107)-dimensional zero - curvature space ( spacetime ) and a two - dimensional curved spacetime ( space ) .",

    "this has been shown for gauss - bonnet gravity in the presence of codimension two branes @xcite .",
    "finally , we give some comments on the number of independent solutions in various order of lovelock gravity . for static solutions of lovelock gravity",
    ", the @xmath168 components of the field equation can be integrated in order to get an algebraic equation for @xmath76 .",
    "this algebraic equation is linear for the einstein equation , quadratic for gauss - bonnet gravity , cubic for third order lovelock gravity , quartic for fourth order lovelock gravity and so on .",
    "this suggests that @xmath76 has only one branch in einstein , two branches in gauss - bonnet , three branches in third order lovelock gravity , and so on .",
    "but the point which should be regarded carefully is the number of real branches of @xmath76 .",
