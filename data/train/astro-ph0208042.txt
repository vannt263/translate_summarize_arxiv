    "in the past three years , great strides have been made in the detection of extrasolar planets ( xsps ) . to date , nearly all of the roughly 100 known xsps have been discovered using the radial velocity ( rv ) technique . however , rv detections , in and of themselves , yield only a few planetary parameters , namely the period @xmath1 , the eccentricity @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the planet and @xmath5 is the inclination of its orbit .",
    "by contrast , if a planet transits its host star , much more information is available .",
    "first , of course , the @xmath3 degeneracy can be broken .",
    "second , the ratio of the radii of the planet and host star can be measured .",
    "therefore , provided that the star can be classified well enough to determine its mass and radius , then the planet s radius and hence its density can be determined .",
    "third , and perhaps most important , if the transits can be observed with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , then one can probe otherwise unobservable details of a planet , such as its oblateness @xcite , atmospheric conditions @xcite , and perhaps satellites and rings . regardless of how a planet is initially discovered ,",
    "once it is determined to transit its host star , this wealth of information can in principle be extracted by intensive follow - up observation of these transits .",
    "this fact has been amply demonstrated by the discovery and analysis of the transiting planet hd209458b @xcite .    at the moment , all ongoing and proposed transit surveys are carried out in relatively narrow pencil beams .",
    "they make up for their small angular area with relatively deep exposures .",
    "these surveys fall into two basic classes : field stars @xcite + http://www.hao.ucar.edu/public/research/stare/stare.html + http://bulge.princeton.edu/~{}ogle/[http://bulge.princeton.edu/~\\{}ogle/ ] ] , and clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ] .",
    "these surveys are potentially capable of establishing the frequency of planets in various environments , but they are unlikely to find the kinds of transits of bright stars that would be most useful for intensive follow - up analysis . although some of the surveys of field stars are considered `` wide field '' , their total survey areas are small compared to @xmath6 str .",
    "one project that has the potential to cover a very large area is wasp @xcite , which plans to employ five cameras , each with a @xmath7 field of view .",
    "an alternative method is to conduct an all - sky survey . instead of continuous observation of all targets ( which is impossible from a practical standpoint for an all - sky survey )",
    ", this approach would necessarily involve revisiting each target in the sky at regular , semi - regular , or random intervals throughout the course of the project .",
    "this kind of observing strategy will not yield a continuous light curve on any star , as the current transit surveys do .",
    "rather , this plan will generate an only sporadically sampled light curve .",
    "however , the long time baseline for the survey will eventually generate just as many individual observations of a single star .",
    "transit - like dips in the data stream will not be visually obvious , but by repeatedly phase - folding the full light curve back on itself over a range of periods , one can detect the dips from the transits .",
    "( see   [ sec : randomnoise ] . )",
    "this approach is especially relevant given the fact that there are several all - sky surveys already being planned for objectives other than transit detections . it should be possible , for instance , to utilize the photometric data stream of upcoming astrometric missions for transit detection .",
    "space - based projects such as gaia and diva would take hundreds of observations of millions of stars over mission lengths of years with the aim of obtaining precise astrometry .",
    "these data could equally well be analyzed for planetary transits .",
    "there are also several existing or proposed ground - based all - sky surveys , including the large - aperture synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , the panoramic optical imager ( poi ) , and the all - sky automated survey ( asas ) @xcite .",
    "these surveys will be imaging the entire sky every few days , a qualitatively similar cadence to those of gaia and diva .",
    "while lsst and poi will likely be saturated by stars of @xmath8 , which are of greatest interest for transit follow - ups , asas is of particular interest in the present context because of its very small aperture .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the process of analyzing photometric data streams from all - sky surveys to find transits .",
    "we calculate the sensitivity to xsp detection , the distance out to which these detections will be possible , and the number of false - positive detections due to random noise .",
    "we derive a general expression for the number of stars that can be probed by this technique as a function of the total sensitivity of the survey .",
    "we apply our analysis to the problem of telescope design and conclude that very small , 5 cm telescopes are optimal for finding transits of bright stars .",
    "in order to accurately determine the number of transits a given survey would be expected to detect , we must carefully define the set of stellar systems that can be probed for transits by the survey .",
    "this will evidently depend on the number density @xmath9 , the luminosity @xmath10 , and the radius @xmath11 , of the stars being probed ; as well as the semi - major axis @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 of their planets . a quick ( and naive ) formulation",
    "would then state that the total number of systems that can be probed for transits @xmath14 is @xmath15^{3}\\ ] ] for a homogeneous population of such stars , where @xmath16 is the distance out to which a transit can be detected .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath16 is ill - defined . for fixed @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and distance @xmath17 ,",
    "the transit detection scales as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the transit impact parameter normalized to @xmath11 ; that is , @xmath20 . hence , the signal - to - noise ratio scales as @xmath21 .",
    "since detections normally require a minimum s / n , @xmath16 must also be a function of the impact parameter @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for a photon - noise limited survey , @xmath22 , and therefore @xmath23^{3}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the distance out to which a transit can be detected for an edge - on ( @xmath5 = @xmath26 ) orbit .",
    "we must then integrate over all values of the impact parameter @xmath19 from 0 to 1 , and so @xmath27^{3}\\ ] ] where , @xmath28 we now determine the dependence of @xmath14 , the total number of systems probed , on the remaining parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . to do so",
    ", we analyze the detection requirement , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of observations of the transit over the length of the survey , @xmath31 is the fractional change in the star s brightness during the transit , @xmath32 is the fractional error of an individual flux measurement , and @xmath33 is the minimum acceptable difference in @xmath34 between a fit that assumes a constant flux and one that takes account of a transit . as we discuss in   [ sec : randomnoise ] , @xmath35 must be set sufficiently high to avoid spurious detections due to random noise .    * to determine the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath10 , we note that in equation ( [ equnt ] ) , the only factor that depends on @xmath10 is @xmath36 . for a particular star , the flux @xmath37 , thus @xmath38 , and so @xmath39 .",
    "* for the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath11 , we note that @xmath40 , and that @xmath41 , so @xmath42 . from equation ( [ equchi ] ) , we see that @xmath43 . since @xmath30 is the total number of observations of the star during transits over the length of the survey , @xmath44 . also ,",
    "thus , @xmath46 . combining these relations with the explicit factor of @xmath11 in equation ( [ equnt ] ) itself , we arrive at @xmath47 .",
    "* for the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath12 , we see that @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . using @xmath48",
    ", we have @xmath49 , and so @xmath50 . *",
    "finally , for the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath13 , the only factor that depends on @xmath13 is @xmath31 , from @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 , and so @xmath53 .",
    "consolidating the dependence of @xmath14 on the various parameters , we finally arrive at , @xmath54 where @xmath55 = @xmath56 .",
    "that is , @xmath57 is the distance out to which a planet - star system with @xmath58 and the fiducial parameters @xmath59 can just barely be detected at the s / n threshold .",
    "we now seek to simplify equation ( [ equfin ] ) by integrating over the local stellar population at fixed absolute magnitude , @xmath60 , and so we replace the three independent variables @xmath61 by the single variable @xmath60 .",
    "we consider two regimes @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( with one overlapping bin at @xmath64 , which we will use later to check for consistency ) .",
    "we first treat the fainter regime . here",
    ", the main sequence is relatively narrow .",
    "hence , @xmath11 may be regarded as a function of @xmath10 ( and so , therefore , of @xmath60 ) , while @xmath9 is simply the number density of stars in a given magnitude bin .",
    "hence , the `` integration '' amounts to a simple multiplication of factors .",
    "we adapt the number density of stars @xmath9 from the empirically determined local stellar luminosity function ( lf ) : for the range ( 9 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath65 18 ) we use the lf reported in @xcite , and for the range ( 6 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath65 8) we use the lf of @xcite .    to estimate stellar radii , we combine the linear color - magnitude relation , @xmath67 from @xcite , a color / surface - brightness relation @xmath68 , based on the data of @xcite , and @xmath69 color - color relations for dwarfs from @xcite",
    ". we can therefore calculate the relative number of systems with a fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of @xmath66 , which we designate @xmath70 \\left [   \\frac{l(m_{v})}{l_{0 } } \\right]^{3/2 } \\left [   \\frac{r(m_{v})}{r_{0 } } \\right]^{-7/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the normalizations chosen below .    for the upper main sequence , @xmath63",
    ", we evaluate @xmath73 directly using the hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "for example , the lf for @xmath74 would be computed by summing @xmath75^{-1}$ ] over all stars within the hipparcos completeness limit , @xmath76 , having @xmath77 , and lying within 50 pc .",
    "the distance @xmath78 is the minimum of 50 pc and the distance at which the star would have @xmath79 .",
    "actually , we are not directly interested in the lf at @xmath74 , but rather in the integral of @xmath80 over the subpopulations that make up the @xmath81 bin of the lf . hence @xmath82 the stellar radii",
    "are determined from hipparcos / tycho @xmath83 photometry and the color / surface - brightness relation of @xcite , @xmath84 , ultimately derived from @xcite .    to normalize @xmath85",
    ", we adopt the values associated with @xmath86 stars : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .    the resulting function ( fig .",
    "[ figf ] ) shows that the majority of stars that are probed will be f and g type ( @xmath90 ) . to check how this distribution depends on the size of the volume sampled , we recalculate the distribution function for the case in which the observed stars cover a much larger volume  one which would be better described by a thin disk , rather than a spherically uniform distribution . for this case",
    "we find that the scalings shown in equation ( [ equf ] ) are replaced by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the scale height of each population .",
    "the distribution function is still dominated by f and g stars , but there are more k and early to mid m stars ( @xmath93 ) . of course , it is common knowledge that magnitude - limited @xmath94 samples of main - sequence stars will be dominated by f and g stars .",
    "the interesting feature of figure [ figf ] is that this result does not qualitatively change despite the addition of the factor @xmath95 in equation ( [ equf ] ) , which very strongly favors later - type stars .",
    "equation ( [ equfin ] ) describes what kinds of xsp systems can be detected by a certain survey , given a photometric detection limit .",
    "the threshold @xmath96 is determined by taking account of the fact that the data stream from an xsp search must be analyzed for any combination of the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 within reasonable ranges .",
    "such analysis will , however , yield a number of false - positive detections due to random noise .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath33 must be chosen to yield a manageable number of candidate systems for follow - up observations .    to determine @xmath33",
    ", we generate 1000 independent simulated streams of photometric observations of a single system with a host star of one solar mass and a circular planetary orbit .",
    "we attempt to simulate a schedule that would be characteristic of an all - sky survey that re - images a given star approximately every few days with varying intervals between observations . for each data stream , we generate 1000 observations at irregular intervals over 1800 simulated days , and then phase the observations for a range of periods from 3.0 to 3.1 days and a range of transit lengths .",
    "the number of the observations and the duration of the simulated survey are arbitrarily chosen as plausible characteristics for the type of all - sky survey we envision .",
    "the duration of the transit depends on the orientation of the system with respect to our line of sight , and we analyze the data for eight equally spaced , progressively more inclined orientations . for each orientation , we test for 16 equally spaced phases .",
    "we test the resulting data sets for transit - like dips in the light curve , which we define simply as intervals during which the local mean light curve dips significantly below the global average .",
    "this @xmath97 grid structure is chosen empirically : we find that the number of false positives increases linearly with grid density below this density and then flattens above it .",
    "the result shows that for this kind of system , in order to restrict follow - up analysis to the 0.1% of the full sample most likely to yield a true transit detection , the value for @xmath33 should be set to @xmath98 36.6 .",
    "we take the highest value of @xmath99 from each of the 1000 sets , and of those highest values , we then sort the 1000 sets from highest value of @xmath99 to lowest . in fig .",
    "[ figchi ] ( inset ) , we plot the highest value of @xmath99 for each of the 1000 data streams .    to check the robustness of this number , we run additional simulations of 25 data sets , each with different observation schedules .",
    "first , we generate a set of observations that are randomly distributed throughout a 1800 day mission , with the requirement that no two observations be less than 10 minutes apart .",
    "then we regenerate the data set with observations that are evenly spaced throughout the project .",
    "we also conduct the analysis on data sets with evenly spaced pairs of observations , with the observations in each pair separated by 14.4 minutes ; and then again with the pair - spacing at 43.2 minutes .",
    "these different configurations test for different types of observing schedules .",
    "for instance , a ground - based all - sky survey would most likely observe a star at essentially random times throughout a project . on the other hand , a space - based mission with a slowly rotating telescope ( similar to the hipparcos satellite )",
    "would observe a star in pairs of observations separated by minutes .",
    "for various reasons there could be a certain regularity imposed on either the space - based or ground - based observations .",
    "we find that the value for @xmath33 does not depend strongly on the observing schedule .",
    "we determine this by taking the highest value of @xmath99 for each of the 25 independent data streams , sorting the highest values of @xmath99 from each set in the manner described above , and then plotting the results for each type of observing schedule ( fig .",
    "[ figchi ] ) .",
    "we find that there is only a @xmath98 10% variation in @xmath33 for different schedules .",
    "the value of @xmath33 depends on the number of different parameter configurations that are tested .",
    "when we rerun our analysis using a period range of 3.0 to 3.5 days , we increase the size of our parameter space by a factor of 5 .",
    "we expect that the value of @xmath33 depends on the size of the parameter space , @xmath100 , according to @xmath101 .",
    "this prediction agrees with the simulations , which show that an increase in parameter space by a factor of 5 leads to an increase in @xmath33 by @xmath102 .",
    "we then predict @xmath33 if the size of the parameter space is expanded to search for transits with periods between 2 and 10 days ( the range of periods most probable for the sort of fiducial values of the other parameters we have chosen ) .",
    "this would increase @xmath100 by a factor of 80 compared to the period range of 3.0 to 3.1 days .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 for the expanded range of periods is higher than 36.6 by @xmath103 .",
    "so the value expected for @xmath33 for such an analysis is about 45 .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath104on the observing schedule implies that the sensitivity of a project to planets essentially depends only on the total number of photons detected from each star , and not on the details of how they are collected . for a given star ,",
    "this number is obviously proportional to the flux .",
    "we therefore characterize the sensitivity of the observing setup ( telescope + detectors + duration + weather + etc . ) by @xmath105 , the total number of photons that are detected from a fiducial @xmath106 mag star during the entire project .",
    "( here we adopt @xmath106 as a reference , although the stars of interest lie in the range @xmath107 . )",
    "we can utilize the various relations used to derive equation ( [ equfin ] ) to relate @xmath105 to @xmath108 , the maximum apparent magnitude at which an equatorial transit can be detected , @xmath109 then , considering equations ( [ equchi ] ) , ( [ equfin ] ) , and ( [ equf ] ) , we obtain @xmath110 where we have adopted @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and where we have made our evaluation at @xmath114 ( i.e. @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117pc , and @xmath118 ) .",
    "note that @xmath119 corresponds to approximately 625 20-second exposures with a 5 cm telescope and a broadened @xmath120 type filter for one @xmath106 mag fiducial star .    as mentioned above",
    ", a noteworthy feature of equation ( [ equfin2 ] ) is that @xmath14 depends on the characteristics of the survey primarily through the parameter @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath33 depends only logarithmically on the size of the parameter space being explored , it plays a minimal role in survey design compared to the other variables in equation ( [ equfin2 ] ) .",
    "we envision two scenarios to which these results will be applicable . in one , a stream of photometric measurements from a space - based astrometric mission , such as gaia , could be searched for transits . in the other ,",
    "a ground - based survey could use one or more dedicated telescopes to search all bright stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we now apply the general analysis of   [ sec : scalingrelations ] and   [ sec : sysprob ] to the problem of optimizing telescope design for quickly locating a `` large '' number of bright ( @xmath121 ) transiting systems . since only one such systems is now known , we define `` large '' as @xmath122 . from equation ( [ equfin2 ] ) and",
    "the 0.75% frequency of hot jupiters measured from rv surveys , there are roughly 5 such systems to be discovered over the whole sky per magnitude bin at @xmath114 for @xmath123 .",
    "hence , from figure [ figf ] , of order 25 are to be discovered from all spectral types",
    ". it would , of course , be possible to discover even more by going fainter , but setting this relatively bright limit is advisable for three reasons .",
    "first , as we argued in the introduction , the brightest transits are the most interesting scientifically , and most of the transits detected in any survey will be close to the magnitude limit .",
    "second , as we discuss below , a high dynamic range , @xmath124 , can only be achieved at considerable cost to the observing efficiency .",
    "hence , if high efficiency is to be maintained , setting @xmath108 fainter means eliminating the brightest ( most interesting ) systems .",
    "third , at @xmath123 , we are already reaching distances of 100 pc for g stars .",
    "hence the number of transits observed in fainter surveys will not continue to grow as @xmath125 as in equation ( [ equfin ] ) .    in previous sections , we ignored the loss of sensitivity to systems that are brighter than @xmath126 , which is set by saturation of the detector ( or more precisely , by the flux at which detector non - linearities can no longer be accurately calibrated ) .",
    "this fraction is @xmath127 , or 6% for @xmath128 , which we therefore adopt as a sensible goal .",
    "that is , we wish to optimize the telescope design for , @xmath129 ( in any event , essentially all stars @xmath130 have already been surveyed for xsps using rv , and the problem of determining which among the planet - bearers have transits is trivial compared to the problem of conducting an all - sky photometric variability survey . )",
    "optimization means maximizing the photon collection rate , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the duration of the experiment and @xmath105 is , again , the total number of photons collected from a fiducial @xmath133 mag star .",
    "explicitly , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the angular size of the detector , @xmath136 is the diameter of the primary - optic , @xmath137 is the fraction of the time actually spent exposing , and @xmath138 is a constant that depends on the telescope , filter , and detector throughput . for our calculations ,",
    "we assume @xmath139 , which is appropriate for a broad @xmath120 filter and the fiducial @xmath133 mag star .",
    "the design problems are brought into sharper relief by noting that @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the linear size of the detector and @xmath142 is the focal ratio , or @xmath143/ # , of the optics .",
    "equation ( [ equgam1 ] ) then becomes @xmath144    that is , almost regardless of other characteristics of the system , the camera should be made as fast as possible .",
    "we will adopt @xmath145 , below which it is substantially more difficult to fabricate optics .",
    "a more remarkable feature of equation ( [ equgam2 ] ) is that all explicit dependence on the size of the primary optic has vanished : a 1 cm telescope and an 8 m telescope would appear equally good ! actually , as we now show , there is a hidden dependence of @xmath137 on @xmath136 , which favors small telescopes .      the global efficiency @xmath137 can be broken down into two factors , @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the fraction of time available for observing ( i.e. , during which the sky is dark , the weather is good , etc . ) , and @xmath148 is the fraction of this available observing time that the shutter is actually open .",
    "the first factor is not affected by telescope design and so will be ignored for the moment .",
    "the second factor should be maximized .",
    "the smaller the telescope aperture is , the longer the exposures can be before a @xmath149 mag star saturates . since the readout time is fixed , a smaller fraction of time is lost to read - out .",
    "we adopt as benchmarks a detector with pixel size of @xmath150 m , well depths of @xmath151 , and a telescope diameter of 5 cm .    to make explicit calculations , @xmath152 , the full width at half maximum of the point spread function ( psf ) must be specified . for the fast optics ( @xmath153 few )",
    "we consider here , the diffraction limit is always much smaller than a pixel , regardless of aperture : @xmath154 ( for our fiducial choices ) . at the small apertures we will consider , the diffraction limit is larger than the seeing , so it is possible to make the psf much smaller than a pixel , @xmath155 . this would have the advantage of reducing sky noise and is a useful approach when it is possible to always center the telescope at the same field position as is the case for `` point and stare '' experiments .",
    "however , for an all - sky survey , which cycles through many fields , such precision repeat pointing is extremely difficult . without it ,",
    "precision photometry is impossible unless the sub - pixel response of the ccd is mapped out in detail .",
    "we therefore adopt a nyquist - sampled psf , for which the sky noise is approximately that falling on @xmath156 pixels .    our overall consideration for telescope design must take into account three factors .",
    "first , we with to maximize observing efficiency @xmath148 .",
    "second , we wish to achieve the highest possible signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "third , we must avoid any distortion problems with the optics .",
    "there are four effects through which aperture size can impact these factors .",
    "two of these effects , observing efficiency and scintillation noise , will drive us to larger telescopes , while the other two effects , sky noise and focal plane distortion , will drive us to smaller telescopes . as we show below , for the observing parameters",
    "we have specified an aperture of 5 cm ensures a manageable ( and unique ) balance between the various effects .",
    "assuming nyquist sampling , at most half the light from a point source falls within one pixel .",
    "we can directly calculate the ratio of time lost to readout @xmath157 to the time spent exposing @xmath158 , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the well depth of the detector pixels , and @xmath161 = @xmath162 is a fiducial well depth .",
    "note that the factor @xmath163 , which arises from the need to avoid saturation of the brightest stars ( where @xmath164 ) , has been broken up into two terms to permit easy comparisons of equation ( [ equtexp ] ) with equations ( [ equscint2 ] ) and ( [ equskynoise ] ) below .    in order to maximize the efficiency @xmath165 ,",
    "the fraction of observing time devoted to readout should be minimized , and therefore , according to equation ( [ equtexp ] ) , so should the aperture size .",
    "the telescope will operate reasonably efficiently so long as @xmath166 .",
    "another concern that arises for small apertures is the effect of atmospheric scintillation , which is characterized by ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xmath167 where @xmath168 = 0.09 , @xmath169 is the airmass , @xmath92 is the altitude of the observatory , and @xmath170 km is the scale height of the atmosphere . using values of @xmath171 cm , @xmath172 , @xmath173 km , and @xmath174 s , we find @xmath175 .    hence , for exposure times set by a saturation threshold , @xmath176 ( see eq . [ [ equtexp ] ] ) , @xmath177 therefore , despite the common perception that scintillation is a greater problem for smaller telescopes , for the fixed photon counts per exposure that are of interest in the present context , scintillation noise increases with _ increasing _ aperture",
    "however , this dependence is fairly weak . for @xmath171 cm , the scintillation noise is just slightly smaller than the photon noise at @xmath106 .",
    "all the calculations in  ",
    "[ sec : scalingrelations ] , [ sec : randomnoise ] , and [ sec : sysprob ] have assumed that sky noise is negligible , i.e. @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the light from the sky falling on 13 pixels ( for nyquist sampling ) . assuming a somewhat conservative mean sky brightness of @xmath180 , one finds @xmath181 .",
    "\\label{equsky}\\ ] ] to determine how much of a problem sky noise will be , we can compare it to the amount of photon noise , @xmath182 thus , sky noise is less than photon noise for a 5 cm telescope , but would become a serious problem for a substantially smaller aperture .      focal plane distortions toward the edge of the detector become difficult ( and expensive ) to correct when the field of view is too large .",
    "for example , for a @xmath0 detector with @xmath150 m pixels , @xmath183 again , this is manageable for @xmath171 cm but could would potentially be a problem for smaller apertures .",
    "although this field of view is not so large as to create focal plane distortions , it is important to note that for a field of view this large , the telescope must be placed on an equatorial mount . for the alternative , an alt - az mount , the rotation of the sky will cause stars at one edge of the field to move faster across the detector than stars at the opposite edge . for similar reasons , the telescope must track rather than using drift scan .",
    "the relationships described in   [ subsubsec : exptime ] through   [ subsubsec : focalplane ] can be used to optimize the aperture @xmath136 for any survey parameterized by a given @xmath108 .",
    "one is driven to smaller apertures by the goals of minimizing scintillation noise and the fraction of time spent on readout , and to larger apertures by the goals of minimizing sky noise and field distortion . given available @xmath184 cm @xmath185 detectors and reasonably fast @xmath145 optics ,",
    "a @xmath186 cm telescope is optimal for an all - sky survey of @xmath133 stars . among all existing transit programs of which we are aware",
    ", the wasp telescope ( @xmath187 cm lens , @xmath188 focal ratio , @xmath189 , @xmath190 cm detector , @xcite ) comes closest to meeting these design specifications .",
    "we use equation ( [ equgam2 ] ) to determine the required duration of the experiment using our optimally - designed telescope , adopting @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath184 cm , and @xmath145 . the total time required to conduct the survey assuming only source photon noise is @xmath195 . taking into account sky noise and scintillation",
    "increases that time by a factor of 2.5 to 10 months .    for surveys that intend to search for transits of stars fainter than the range we consider in this paper ( @xmath196 ) ,",
    "the relations in   [ subsubsec : exptime ] through   [ subsubsec : focalplane ] operate somewhat differently . for the magnitude range we are considering , equations ( [ equtexp ] ) and ( [ equscint2 ] )",
    "provide an upper limit on the aperture size , while equations ( [ equskynoise ] ) and ( [ equ : focalplane ] ) place a lower limit , in which both limits converge to @xmath197 . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the aperture size is restricted according to equations ( [ equtexp ] ) and ( [ equskynoise ] ) : @xmath198 this equation shows how the aperture size limits combine into a single scaling relation .",
    "what of the other two limiting factors ?",
    "the issue of focal plane distortions is unimportant at fainter magnitudes , since @xmath199 , which is outside of the regime where such distortions are a factor .",
    "scintillation effects are also not a factor at fainter magnitudes , since the scintillation - noise restriction requires that @xmath200 , which is a looser restriction than that of equation ( [ equ : highmag ] ) .        in the previous section",
    ", we estimated the duration of observations required to achieve the minimum s / n to detect transits by hot jupiters assuming certain fiducial parameters of a ground - based telescope , but calculated within the framework of a literal `` all - sky '' ( @xmath6 ) survey of randomly - timed observations that is more characteristic of satellite missions .",
    "the resulting estimate is useful for judging the viability of a given observing setup , but it glosses over a key issue in the detection of transits , namely the problem of folding the data . as discussed in  [ sec : randomnoise ] , the number of folds ( and hence the size of the search space that must be probed ) scales directly as the duration of the experiment .",
    "this larger search space increases both the minimum @xmath202 for a robust detection and the amount of computing power needed to sift through the search space .",
    "the first effect is logarithmic in the size of the search space , so a 10-fold increase changes @xmath203 by only @xmath204 , which is well under 10% .",
    "however , the second effect is linear in the search space and so could easily overwhelm available computing resources if not carefully monitored .",
    "that is , there are important drivers for keeping the duration of observations of any given field to a minimum and hence for exploring the question of whether it is better to break up the `` all - sky '' survey into several smaller components , each of which could be completed in a shorter time .",
    "indeed , the ogle experiment @xcite , the only transit experiment to successfully detect a transit @xcite , was motivated by these considerations to concentrate its observations over a month duration so as to limit the number of foldings .    to estimate the true duration of the project required the achieve the minimum s / n",
    ", one must take account of two factors : first , as a practical matter , ground - based surveys from a single location can cover only an angular area @xmath205 .",
    "second , during a year of continuous observations , any given patch of sky is observed only for about 6 months .",
    "these factors change the previous estimates from  [ sec : optteldes ] .",
    "the first factor implies that the observing time required to reach minimum s / n is actually lower than the time calculated from equation ( [ equgam2 ] ) by a factor of @xmath206 , since the project is observing about half the angular area on the sky .",
    "the impact of the second factor is more complex . in a given night",
    ", only half the accessible angular area @xmath207 can be observed .",
    "therefore , each night the available area to observe is lower by an additional factor of 2 , which means the rate of observations of a given point on the sky will double again .",
    "there are two scenarios at this point .",
    "the first scenario is that after accounting for the first factor , the time required for sufficient s / n is less than a year . in this case , the two factors combine to lower the estimate from  [ sec : optteldes ] by a factor of about 4 . in the second scenario , the time required for sufficient s / n is more than a year . in this case , after observing for 6 months the minimum s / n is not reached , and therefore the project will have to pick up again six more months later when the target is again visible , and so the second factor does not apply . as we see below , however , for the parameters we are considering , we are well within the regime of the first scenario .",
    "applying the first factor to the result in  [ sec : optteldes ] reduces the calculated time from 10 months to 5 months .",
    "since this latter duration is indeed smaller than 1 year , the second factor implies that the requisite s / n will actually be reached in 2.5 months .",
    "this is only slightly longer than the duration of the ogle observations .",
    "however , real experiments inevitably have larger errors than expected .",
    "( we mention one source of additional errors below . )",
    "if the errors prove sufficiently larger that the experiment requires more than 1 year ( after application of the first factor ) to achieve the minimum s / n , then one would not gain the advantage of the second factor . in this case",
    ", it would be better to break the sky up into strips by declination , and observe each strip for a year , so as to increase the s / n obtained in each strip during a single year , and so to permit the application of the second factor .",
    "another real - world consideration is that the photometric errors will not be gaussian .",
    "for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometry errors , while gaussian in their core , deteriorate to an exponential profile in the wings beginning at about @xmath208 @xcite .",
    "such deterioration is likely to set in earlier for the small - aperture , wide - field , low - budget cameras that we envisage here .",
    "the non - gaussian _ form _ of the errors has no practical impact on our analysis : there are so many data points that the central limit theorem guarantees that their combined behavior in each phase bin will be gaussian ( as we have implicitly assumed in  [ sec : randomnoise ] .",
    "however , the non - gaussian tails will tend to increase the @xmath32 of the distribution relative to what would be inferred from the core , which of course will degrade the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "if the errors are as well - behaved as those of sdss , this problem can easily be resolved by the standard device of 3-@xmath32 clipping . if not , then more complex strategies will be required .",
    "these are likely to be among the biggest practical problems facing the analysis , but in the absence of real data , they can not be further analyzed here ."
