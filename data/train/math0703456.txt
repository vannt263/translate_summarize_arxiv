    "we are still optimistic and want to illustrate our hope by an example of @xmath1-dimensional gorenstein simplices @xmath768 of index @xmath0 defined as @xmath769 where @xmath770 are positive integers having the property @xmath771 @xmath494 .",

    "we observe that the simplex @xmath768 determines a landau - ginzburg model with lg - potential of fermat type : @xmath786 the corresponding formula for the @xmath590-polynomial is expected to coincide with the well - known formula of vafa @xcite",
    ". the latter one does not change if one adds any quadratic terms to @xmath787 .",
    "therefore we come to finitely many @xmath590-polynomials for a fixed value of @xmath788 .",

    "are the mirror calabi - yau complete intersections @xmath809 and @xmath810 birationally isomorphic ?    even if in general the answer to this question will be negative , we can use the approach of the homological mirror symmetry and formulate the following conjecture :    there exists a equivalence ( of fourier - mukai type ) between the derived category of coherent sheaves on two calabi - yau complete intersections @xmath809 and @xmath810 .",
    "this conjecture needs some comments , because calabi - yau varieties @xmath809 and @xmath810 are usually singular .",
    "however , using toric methods , one can always construct their partial crepant desingularizations @xmath811 and @xmath812 which are calabi - yau varieties having at worst terminal abelian quotient singularities .",
    "as in the toroidal case considered by kawamata in @xcite the equivalence class of stacky derived categories of @xmath811 and @xmath812 should be independent of the choice of the partial crepant desingularizations .",
