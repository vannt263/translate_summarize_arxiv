    "a particularly interesting direction within the landscape of topological systems is to realize topological superconductivity . within condensed matter physics",
    "there has been a significant effort to find systems that exhibit topological superconductivity as such systems are predicted to harbor the , heretofore , elusive majorana fermions@xcite .",
    "there have been a number of proposals that have been predicted to realize topological superconductivity , and these proposals may be grouped into two : ( i ) unconventional superconducting materials such as sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2@xcite or doped superconducting materials such as cu@xmath3bi@xmath4se@xmath5@xcite and ( ii ) proximity - coupled system comprised of a conventional superconductor and a system such as strongly spin - orbit coupled semiconductors@xcite , magnetic adatoms@xcite , or 3d time - reversal invariant ( tri ) topological insulators ( ti)@xcite .",
    "while much work has taken place on both groups of proposals , there have been few unambiguous signs of topological superconductivity observed experimentally . in this endeavor ,",
    "the most promising experimental signatures have come from the second class of proposals , in particular the spin - orbit coupled semiconductors@xcite and magnetic adatoms proximity - coupled with @xmath0-wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that within each of the proposals to observe topological superconductivity , there is a trend in the components required to produce the unconventional superconductivity : non - zero berry curvature induced by spin - orbit coupling and broken time reversal symmetry by magnetism .    of the available platforms within which one may combine these ingredients , one of the well known routes to generate topological superconductivity is via the superconducting proximity effect in a heterostructure sample of a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor and 3d tri ti@xcite . in the pioneering work of fu and kane ,",
    "cooper pairs from @xmath0-wave superconductors that are proximity - coupled to 3d tri ti tunnel from the superconductor into the ti resulting in the acquisition of an topological superconductivity that behaves an effective spinless , chiral @xmath6 superconductor without breaking time - reversal symmetry .",
    "as compared to proposals using non - ti heterostructures@xcite or intrinsic superconductors@xcite , the fu - kane proposal is attractive as it does not require further assumptions on any of the physical parameters such as cooper pairing amplitudes between different orbitals@xcite or the position of the chemical potential@xcite . to facilitate the generation of chiral edge states , a zeeman field may be introduced to open a gap in the energy spectrum and thereby form a boundary at the surface of the ti@xcite . to this end , topological insulators with magnetic dopants that break time - reversal symmetry are of great interest@xcite as a platform to observe topological superconductivity and chiral edge states . in this work ,",
    "we study how introducing magnetic dopants affects the proximity induced superconductivity of the 3d ti system . unlike a similar study that has been performed on magnetically - doped ti whose zeeman field is randomly oriented within the ti@xcite ,",
    "we consider magnetically ordered dopants through the addition of a uniform zeeman splitting term in a thin 3d tri ti sample such as bi@xmath1se@xmath7 to form a magnetic domain via the net exchange field@xcite . as",

    ", we note that the model can be separated into independent sectors , whose relevant pairing potential have a symmetric and anti - symmetric spatial form when superconductivity is added .",

    "our numerical simulation accurately captures the effects of bulk and surface bands that are present in ti and includes the spin dynamics of these bands when magnetism is introduced .",
    "an induced superconducting order parameter obtained from bulk states of the ti shows a rapid decay in magnitude with increasing magnetic impurity concentration as the zeeman energy splits the band and suppresses the @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "in contrast , the surface states show an induced order parameter that persists over an experimentally relevant range of the zeeman energy due to their spin - momentum locked nature and non - zero projection of electron pairs into the @xmath0-wave pairing component .",
    "moreover , self - consistent calculation shows that the anti - symmetric pairing potential is dominant at non - zero zeeman energy , thereby , we confirm our phenomenological analysis .",

    "when a surface state is coupled to a superconducting system , one may observe an induced superconducting order parameter in the surface states of the ti as cooper pairs tunnel from the superconductor system@xcite . in our system ,",
    "the induced order parameters in the top and bottom surface differ in their magnitude as the cooper pair tunneling probability decays as a function of a spatial separation from the interface between ti and @xmath0-wave superconductor to the other surface of the ti@xcite . due to this gradient in order parameter magnitude , we may decompose the induced order parameter into two distinct components , whose individual @xmath53 phases are symmetric and anti - symmetric in @xmath25 direction .",
    "[ fig : system](c ) shows the simplest example , e.g. @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
