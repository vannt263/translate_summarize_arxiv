    "<S> inspired by the similarity between the mass gaps of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 families , the prediction of a missing higher charmonium with mass @xmath2 mev and very narrow width is made . </S>",

    "<S> . these predictions might be accessible at besiii , belle , and belleii in near future .    since the observation of @xmath0 in 1974 @xcite , the charmonium family has become abundant with more and more such states announced by the experiments @xcite . especially in the past decade , a series of charmonium - like states </S>",
    "<S> have been observed , which have further stimulated theorists extensive interest in revealing their underlying properties ( see a recent review in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , since these novel phenomena reflect non - perturbative behavior of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . among the studies on these states </S>",
    "<S> , it is an important research topic for the whole community of particle physics how to identify the exotic states , whose establishment is , of course , tied with our understanding of the charmonium family .     and @xmath1 families . </S>",
    "<S> [ mass ] ]    when checking the mass spectra of the observed charmonia with spin - parity @xmath8 and comparing them with those of the corresponding bottomonia , we notice that the mass gap between @xmath9 and @xmath0 is almost the same as that between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> there also exist the similar mass differences , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath9 and @xmath14 correspond to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath5 is @xmath17 , such a law is violated since the mass gap of @xmath5 and @xmath14 is much larger than that of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the properties of the charmonia above 4.1 gev are still not understood well , which is the possible reason to result in the above puzzling mass gap . in general , compared with the @xmath0 family , the bottomonia with the radial quantum numbers @xmath20 were well established both by experiment and theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the study of the @xmath0 family can be borrowed from @xmath1 family . </S>",
    "<S> if this law of mass gap relation still holds for states with @xmath21 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 families , we find that the mass of @xmath17 should be located at @xmath2 mev , where we add the mass gap between @xmath18 and @xmath19 to the mass of @xmath14 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mass ] , we show the details of the mass gaps for @xmath0 and @xmath1 families and compare the corresponding gaps with each other . after obtaining the above prediction , we notice the results of the mass spectra of charmonium family given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the screening potential was adopted in their calculation . </S>",
    "<S> they also found that the mass of @xmath17 is about 4,273 mev , which is consistent with our estimate of the mass for the missing charmonium @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , another theoretical work @xcite also supports existence of a missing @xmath17 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the color - screening effect was considered in the calculation of the mass spectrum of charmonium , where the mass of @xmath17 was obtained as 4,247 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> if this predicted state exists in the @xmath0 family , we must reveal its underlying properties to answer why there does not have any evidence in the present experiment , which will be the main task of this work .    before studying this missing charmonium </S>",
    "<S> , we need to introduce two charmonium - like states @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the masses around 4,263 mev . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 was observed by the babar collaboration in the @xmath24 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath25 @xcite , while @xmath23 was reported by the belle collaboration by studying @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both of @xmath22 and @xmath23 have @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back later to discuss whether the missing charmonium has the relation to these two charmonium - like states .    in the following , we study the decay behavior of the missing state corresponding to @xmath17 , which is crucial to explain why this state is still missing at the predicted location and how to search for this in future experiment . in the study </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain its full width which is the important information to us . since the mass of the missing charmonium predicted ( in the next discussion </S>",
    "<S> we adopt @xmath17 to denote this missing charmonium and assume its mass to be 4,263 mev ) is above the thresholds of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath17 can decay into @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    here , we apply the quark pair creation ( qpc ) model @xcite to calculate the decay widths , which is one of the most popular models for studying the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) allowed two - body strong decays of hadrons . for the ozi - allowed decay @xmath29 , </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath36 is the transition operator , i.e. , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the momenta carried by the quark and antiquark created from the vacuum . by using the jacob - wick formula @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the partial wave amplitude can be expressed in terms of the amplitude as @xmath40 finally the decay width is obtained as @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the above description is just a short summary of the qpc model and the detailed introduction of the qpc model can be found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we need to specify that in the concrete calculation , the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wave function is adopted , where the parameter @xmath42 is taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for final states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dimensionless parameter @xmath43 , describing the strength of the quark - antiquark pair creation , is taken as the same value as that in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by fitting the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> we first present the result of charmonium @xmath14 decaying into @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 that are kinematically allowed by the phase space of @xmath14 , which is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3s ] . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated result can well reproduce the experimental widths of @xmath16 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite when taking @xmath48 gev@xmath49 . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the dominant decay modes of @xmath14 , while @xmath44 and @xmath47 are the subordinate decays . here , the conclusion of the @xmath27 decay modes of @xmath14 is in agreement with the babar data @xcite since the measured ratio @xmath50 is @xmath51 . in the same reference , </S>",
    "<S> however , the ratio @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 @xcite which contradicts with a larger value of our calculation as shown in fig . [ 3s ] . hence this ratio must be tested further in future experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the above study shows that @xmath16 assigned as @xmath14 is reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the reliability of the qpc model is also tested here , which enables us to apply this model to safely study the decays of @xmath17 .     </S>",

    "<S> the dashed line with a band ( left ) is the experimental data from ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3s ] ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3s ] , we give the dependence of the partial decay widths of the predicted @xmath17 on the @xmath42 value , which covers the @xmath42 range discussed in @xmath14 . here , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are open for @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> . a very interesting result of the decay behavior of @xmath17 can be found from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3s ] , i.e. , the total decay width of @xmath17 is stable over the corresponding @xmath42 range adopted , while its partial decay widths strongly depend on the @xmath42 value . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is due to the node effects . </S>",
    "<S> our result also shows that the node effects are important when discussing the higher charmonium decays because due to these effects we find that the predicted charmonium @xmath17 has very narrow width around 6 mev .     on the mass of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> [ 4sde ] ]    in addition , we also discuss the dependence of @xmath17 decay behavior on the mass of @xmath17 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 4sde ] , where we take several typical values in a range @xmath56 mev , i.e. , @xmath57 mev , which also cover former theoretical predictions of the mass of @xmath17 in refs . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result listed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 4sde ] indicates that the decay behavior of @xmath17 is weakly dependent on the mass of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we come to the definite conclusion that @xmath17 is a narrow state .    for the higher charmonia above the @xmath44 threshold , </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon of @xmath17 presented here is unusual since the other higher charmonia , @xmath16 , @xmath58 and @xmath5 have widths @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 mev and @xmath61 mev , respectively , all of which are large . </S>",
    "<S> even @xmath62 , which is just 43 mev above the @xmath44 threshold , has the width 27.2 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> if considering the large width difference between the predicted @xmath17 and @xmath63 , it is obvious that there does not exist any correspondence between @xmath17 and the observed charmonium - like states @xmath63 , where the given average values of widths of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath64 mev and @xmath65 mev in particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , respectively . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the non - resonant explanations to charmonium - like states @xmath22 and @xmath23 were proposed , where both of them can be described by the interference effects of the production amplitudes of @xmath66 via the intermediate charmonia @xmath67 and direct @xmath68 annihilation into @xmath69 .    as a typical higher charmonium with a very narrow width , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted @xmath17 is difficult to identify by the analysis of the open - charm decay channels @xcite and the @xmath42 value scan @xcite based on the present experimental data , which can naturally answer why this higher charmonium is still missing in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect future experimental results of the open - charm decays and more precise study of the @xmath42 value scan , especially from besiii , belle , and forthcoming belleii .    </S>",
    "<S> we notice a recent analysis of besiii data in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besiii already realized the measurement of the cross sections of @xmath70 at center - of - mass energies @xmath71 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yuan analyzed the data by fiting the line shape with two breit - wigner functions , which indicates that there are a narrow structure with mass @xmath72 mev and width @xmath73 mev and another broad structure with mass @xmath74 mev and width @xmath75 mev @xcite , where these two charmonium - like structures have @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the resonance parameters of this narrow structure in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with our result of the predicted @xmath17 , one finds their similarity , which means that this narrow charmonium - like structure can be as a good candidate of the predicted @xmath17 in this work . as mentioned above , more experimental efforts will be necessary to clarify this point .     </S>",
    "<S> ( left ) and @xmath7 ( right ) and the comparison with the experimental data of charmonium - like state @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> here , the dashed line with a band is the width of @xmath3 @xcite . [ etac ] ]    in the following , we apply the above approach to study the @xmath76 family by comparing the mass gaps between the @xmath76 and @xmath0 families , where the charmonia in @xmath76 and @xmath0 families belong to s - wave @xmath77 states . </S>",
    "<S> there are two well established @xmath76 states listed in pdg , i.e. , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> their mass gap is about @xmath80 mev , which is similar to that between @xmath9 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , assuming the mass gap between @xmath6 and @xmath79 is the same as that between @xmath14 and @xmath9 , we can estimate the mass of @xmath6 as about 3,992 mev , which is close to the mass of an observed charmonium - like state @xmath3 in the @xmath82 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath83 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath35 parity of @xmath3 favors @xmath84 since @xmath3 is from the double charm production . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath76 also has the same @xmath35 parity @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may identify @xmath3 as @xmath6 . to test it </S>",

    "<S> [ etac ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the total decay width of @xmath6 calculated can be well fitted with the experimental value of @xmath3 when we take the same @xmath42 range as that in the study of @xmath14 , where @xmath45 is the only decay mode of @xmath6 , which can explain why @xmath3 was observed in the @xmath85 channel @xcite under this assumption .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , another charmonium - like state @xmath4 was reported by the belle collaboration through the double charm production , where @xmath4 appears in the @xmath46 invariant mass distribution of @xmath86 @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we also discuss whether @xmath4 can be explained as @xmath7 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ etac ] , the partial and total decay widths of @xmath7 are listed . </S>",
    "<S> the situation of the decay behavior of @xmath7 is very similar to that of @xmath17 discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the total width of @xmath7 is also very narrow , which is not consistent with the measured width of @xmath4 that has @xmath87 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to the above analysis , we can fully exclude the @xmath7 assignment to @xmath4 .    before summarizing our work </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to pay attention to @xmath5 . here , we discuss the possibility of @xmath5 as @xmath88 .     as @xmath88 . here , the dashed line with a band is the experimental data taken from pdg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> [ 5s ] ]    the two - body strong decay behaviors of @xmath5 as a @xmath88 state are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 5s ] . the total width overlaps with the average width in pdg when @xmath42 is in the range of 2.86 to 3.21 gev@xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are its main decay channels . additionally , the typical ratios are @xmath91 and @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath93 gev@xmath49 , which well agree with the babar data @xcite having the measured values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis indicates that it is very likely that @xmath5 is the @xmath88 state . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our calculation the branching ratio @xmath96 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental data from belle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this incompatibility is a challenge to the explanation of @xmath5 as @xmath88 state . </S>",
