    "the spectral fluctuation properties of a generic quantum system with chaotic classical dynamics are known to be universal and to depend only on the associated symmetry class @xcite . accordingly ,",
    "those of the eigenenergies of spinless , chaotic systems possessing time - reversal invariance are well described by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if time - reversal invariance is absent , the eigenvalue statistics coincides with that of random matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "indeed , such a spectral behavior is observed in generic chaotic systems , but not necessarily if additional discrete symmetries are present .",
    "a well known example is provided by time - reversal invariant systems with rotational symmetries .",
    "for instance , the spectrum of billiards with threefold symmetry can be split into singlets and doubly degenerate levels . while the former follow goe statistics , the latter , in fact , behave like the eigenvalues of random matrices from the gue  @xcite .",
    "a different dynamical mechanism for the `` breaking '' of the time - reversal invariance was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where quantum billiards defined on a domain of constant width with smooth boundaries were considered . by virtue of the special geometry of these billiards their classical phase space is split into two ergodic components : a particle launched into the billiard in clockwise and anticlockwise direction , respectively , moves in that rotational direction forever  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to two parts of the phase space that are well seperated by a region of kolmagorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori and possess an almost fully chaotic dynamics .",
    "other examples of constant - width billiards where two ergodic components with fully chaotic dynamics are separated in phase space by just one singular line are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "such a remarkable separation of the phase space , in turn , leads to extraordinary properties of the corresponding quantum billiard .",
    "in particular , its spectrum can be split into quasi - degenerate doublets and singlets .",
    "furthermore , for billiards of constant width with smooth boundaries the spectral statistics of the doublets was shown to be of gue type rather than of goe type  @xcite .",
    "this indeed is reminiscent of the spectral structure in systems with threefold symmetries .",
    "however , contrary to the latter , the energy levels in the doublets of constant - width billiards are not fully degenerate but rather have very small splittings as compared to the mean spacing of the doublets .",
    "while the switching between clockwise and anticlockwise motion is classically strictly forbidden , it is possible via tunneling through the barrier of kam tori in the quantum billiards .",
    "this effect , known as dynamical tunneling , manifests itself in the eigenenergy splittings within the doublets .",
    "dynamical tunneling has been extensively investigated in the last two decades .",
    "reference  @xcite provides a detailed survey on current theoretical and experimental studies within that field of research .",
    "so far , most of the works have focussed on tunneling of quantum particles from regular to chaotic regions of phase space . to describe this phenomenon ,",
    "various methods based both on semiclassical approaches and on random matrix theory ( rmt ) have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the regular - to - chaotic tunneling process is also a building block of the theory of chaos - assisted tunneling  @xcite which describes tunneling between two regions with regular dynamics through one with chaotic dynamics .",
    "first experimental evidence for chaos - assisted tunneling in a flat microwave annular billiard has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the billiards of constant width",
    "the situation is in fact opposite . here , a quantum particle tunnels through a dynamical barrier of regular kam tori between two regions with chaotic dynamics .",
    "to the best of our knowledge such a chaos - to - chaos scenario has been studied so far only for potential barriers  @xcite .    since the tunneling is reflected in the size of the energy splittings ,",
    "an understanding of their statistical properties is of great interest .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to obtain the energy levels of two billiards of constant width experimentally and to study the distribution of the doublet splittings .",
    "it should be noted that in the semiclassical limit the splittings become very small in comparison to the mean spacing of the doublets .",
    "accordingly , the experimental determination of the eigenvalues is very challenging because it requires very precise measurements which we achieved by using superconducting microwave billiards .",
    "we present a rmt model for the splitting distribution that , as is demonstrated in the present article , describes the experimental results very well .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in",
    "we summarize the salient properties of the classical dynamics of constant - width billiards .",
    "section  [ exp ] comprises the description of the microwave experiments .",
    "we used the resonance frequencies extracted from the experimental spectra to compute the associated wave functions and the husimi functions .",
    "this is outlined in  . in",
    "we show results for the spectral properties of two microwave constant - widths billiards and in   for their splitting distributions .",
    "the rmt model developed to describe the latter is introduced in  , and the analytical results derived from it in  .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in  .",
    "the billiards under consideration are convex and have a constant width , i.e. , such a billiard can be inserted in a square which touches it at each of its side , and this still will be the case when the billiard is rotated .",
    "the points @xmath1 on the boundary can be expressed as the real and imaginary parts of the complex function  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "the width , i.e. , the diameter and the perimeter equal @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we investigated the properties of two constant - width billiards , called b1 and b2 in the following .",

    "( [ boundary ] ) of billiards b1 and b2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected @xmath10 is larger for b2 than for b1 , since the regular region around the bbos ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : whisp ] ) is narrower for b2 .",
    "recall that the specific form  ( [ eq : mixedh ] ) of @xmath11 is justified by the fact that the upper and the lower parts of the psos exhibit a mixed regular / chaotic dynamics .",
    "however , since the chaotic component dominates , we may expect that the regular part @xmath12 of @xmath11 plays no essential role for the splitting distribution . to check this assumption we evaluated numerically the splitting distribution for the rmt model  ( [ eq:1 ] ) with @xmath11 drawn from two different ensembles . in the first case we chose @xmath11 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixedh ] ) and fixed @xmath13 as listed in   while in the second one @xmath11 was drawn from the gue , i.e. , we set @xmath14 .",
    "we arrived at the conclusion that the shape of the splitting distribution and also the values of @xmath10 determined from its fit to the experimental ones was the same for both ensembles .",
    "likewise , the experimental splitting distributions barely change when we consider only doublets with the eigenvalues corresponding to chaotic states , i.e. , when skipping those with a husimi distribution localized close to @xmath15 or @xmath16 and around the small regular islands ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : singlet_b1 ] ( b ) , ( c ) and [ fig : whisp_b1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "we thus may conclude that the splitting distribution is solely determined by the parameter @xmath10 and does not depend on the classical dynamics in the upper and the lower half of the psos , respectively , as long as the chaotic component dominates .",
    "actually , the red ( dark gray ) curves shown in fig .  [ fig : splitting_distr_exp_rmt ] were generated for @xmath11 drawn from the gue , i.e. , for @xmath14 .",
    "we already mentioned above that we were not able to resolve tunneling rates corresponding to the individual states in the regular regions  @xcite within the experimentally accessible frequency range .",
    "the good agreement between the rmt model and the experimental results , however , corroborates the legitimacy of this ansatz",
    ".    the considered rmt model , in fact , can be even further simplified because , similar to the spectral properties of the eigenvalues of @xmath11 the splitting distribution is well approximated by that of an ensemble of @xmath17 random matrix from the gue .",
    "accordingly , we set @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and again determined @xmath10 from a fit of the splitting distributions computed for ensembles of 10000 random matrices to the experimental ones .",

    "in the following we derive an analytical expression for the splitting distribution based on the assumption that @xmath11 is a member of the gue . the starting point is the equation for the eigenvalues of @xmath21 . to obtain it",

    "this similarity provides a link between the tunneling parameter @xmath10 and the tunneling matrix element investigated in the context of chaos - assisted tunneling in  @xcite and expressed there entirely in terms of classical quantities .",
    "note that , because of the complex structure of the psos of the constant - width billiards , this would be hard to achieve for their splitting distribution and tunneling rates .",
    "we investigated both experimentally and theoretically the spectral properties and the dynamical tunneling occurring in constant - width billiards with smooth boundaries . to this end",
    "we determined with unprecedented accuracy the resonance frequencies of two superconducting microwave billiards .",
    "a special dynamical feature of constant - width billiards is the unidirectionality , that is , the change of the direction of motion from clockwise ( upper half of the psos ) to anticlockwise ( lower half of the psos ) is not possible . in both parts of the psos",
    "the classical dynamics are predominantly chaotic .",
    "they are separated by a barrier of kam tori .",
    "although the transition through this barrier is forbidden in the classical system , in the corresponding quantum billiard such processes occur due to dynamical tunneling .",
    "they manifest themselves in a splitting of the vast majority of eigenstates into doublets of nearly - degenerate ones .",
    "in addition , there are a few singlet eigenstates localized on the bbos that divide the psos into the parts of clockwise and anticlockwise motion .    to study the spectral properties the doublets were decomposed into two sequences , one containing the smaller , the other one the larger doublet partners .",
    "we demonstrated , that the spectral properties are well described by those of random matrices of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixedh ] ) .",
    "these consisted of a gue matrix modeling the chaotic part , which is coupled to a diagonal matrix containing uncorrelated random numbers and accounting for the regular part of the classical dynamics .",
    "importantly the chaotic component is not modeled by goe matrix , as might be expected for systems with time reversal invariance , due to the unidirectional character of the billiard dynamics .    furthermore , we investigated the effects of dynamical tunneling on the distribution of the splittings between the doublet partners . as opposed to the well studied problem of chaos - assisted tunneling , in the case of billiards of constant width the particle tunnels from one chaotic region of the psos to another one through a barrier of kam tori . using the experimentally determined eigenvalues of the constant - width billiards we computed the associated wave functions and husimi functions . with this information at hand",
    "we could demonstrate that the splittings indeed are enhanced for states that are strongly localized in the barrier region .",
    "we showed that the experimental splitting distributions are well described by the ensemble of random matrices  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , where two complex conjugate gue matrices are coupled via a single state .",
