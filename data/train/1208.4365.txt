    "black holes ( bhs ) , with masses ranging from tens to billion solar masses , are among the most exciting objects in the astrophysical world .",
    "although there is nowadays plenty of evidence for the existence of stellar mass bhs ( @xmath0 ) and massive bhs ( mbhs , @xmath1 ) , there is no convincing observational proof for the existence of bhs in the @xmath2-@xmath3 range , the so called intermediate mass bhs ( imbhs ) .",
    "imbhs could form as a result of dynamical instabilities in dense stellar clusters . despite the large number of works devoted to this problem",
    ", any firm conclusion is still lacking .",
    "runaway collisions between massive stars after their sinking into the cluster center provides a channel to form a very massive ( @xmath4 ) star in the center .",
    "this object would be expected to collapse into an intermediate mass black hole ( miller & hamilton 2002 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) retaining most of the progenitor mass .",
    "more detailed simulations including stellar evolution and feedback from stellar winds at solar metallicities , show a systematic inefficiency in growing the central object to masses larger than @xmath5 ( e.g. , glebbeek et al .",
    "imbhs could then form only in those initially metal poor systems for which stellar mass loss via stellar wind would be strongly reduced .    if theoretical results are unclear , observational evidences are at best elusive .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) , among the densest stellar systems known in galaxies , have become prime sites for imbh searches .",
    "the presence of an imbh would affect the dynamics of the cluster in several ways , and in the last decade many signatures have been proposed .",
    "the presence of an imbh would heat the stellar density profile , creating a large core ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2005 ; trenti 2008 ; umbreit et al .",
    "2009 ) . therefore , imbhs are likely to reside in those cluster showing a large @xmath6 ratio , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the core and the half light radii , respectively .",
    "observations suggest ( baumgardt et al . 2005 ) that this may be the case for @xmath9 of the milky way ( mw ) gcs .",
    "another clear fingerprint is the keplerian rising of the velocity dispersion of the stellar distribution inside the sphere of influence of the imbh .",
    "however , for typical imbh masses , such signature would appear on sub - arcsecond scales , at the limit of current optical facilities .",
    "ibata et al . (",
    "2009 ) report the detection of a keplerian cusp in m54 , consistent with a central @xmath10 imbh ( although radial anisotropy in the stellar distribution may explain the observations as well ) .",

    "the most massive stars should then have had enough time to segregate into the center via dynamical friction .",
    "this mass segregation should be partially suppressed by the presence of an imbh .",
    "several studies on the radial dependence of the stellar mass function in different cluster might be consistent with the presence of an imbh ( see beccari et al .",

    "2009 for ngc 2298 , umbreit et al . 2009 for ngc5694 ) .",
    "however , the presence of primordial binaries can mimic the same effect of an imbh , and it is not clear to what extent the results depend on the chosen initial conditions .",
    "lastly , an imbh would accrete ambient gas , and such accretion activity may be observable in x - ray and/or radio .",
    "measurements of radio luminosity of few galactic gcs put stringent upper limits on imbh masses ( maccarone & servillat 2008 ) . similarly , cseh et al .",
    "( 2010 ) impose a limit of 1500@xmath11 to any putative massive object in the center of ngc 6388 , by using combined x - ray and radio observations .",
    "we notice , however , that these limits are affected by a number of parameters ( like the accretion efficiency , the gas content in gcs , etc . )",
    "that are not constrained themselves .",
    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are usually associated with dense stellar environment , as their formation channel requires a recycling phase within a binary ( camilo & rasio 2006 , lorimer 2008 ) : almost two thirds ( 140 out of 220 ) of the known msps are observed in gcs , most of them in binary systems residing in the gc cores ( lorimer 2008 ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of an imbh and of msps in binary systems in the same gc opens interesting dynamical possibilities .",
    "dynamical interactions with an imbh are expected to break - up binaries ejecting one of the components while leaving the other one bound to the imbh ( hills 1988 , see devecchi et al .",
    "2007 in the context of imbhs ) .",
    "one consequence of the presence of imbhs in gcs would then be the presence of a halo population of fast msps , ejected by this tidal break - up process .",
    "the detection of such population of fast halo msps would not provide a direct evidence for the presence of an imbh in any particular cluster , but will prove the existence of a population of imbhs residing in gcs and capable of ejecting msps via dynamical interactions . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of the expected fast halo msp population for a range of formation models , assessing observability with forthcoming radio instruments , such as the square kilometre array ( ska , lazio 2009 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the main ingredients of our models , namely the gc imbh and msp populations .",
    "the binary - imbh dynamical interaction is detailed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the population of ejected msps highlighting their relevant properties and we discuss observational prospects in section 5 .",
    "our main findings are summarized in section 6 .",
    "we take the galactic gc population from the harris ( 1996 ) catalog .",
    "we calculate the structural parameters of each gc as follow .",
    "we assign each cluster a mass @xmath12 according to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the absolute @xmath15 magnitude given in the catalog , and we used a constant mass to light ratio of 1.45 ( mclaughlin 2003 ) to convert the total cluster luminosity into its mass .",
    "we adopt the observed central luminosity and core radius of each cluster listed in the catalog and calculate the central stellar density and the core mass .",
    "we provide each cluster with a stellar velocity dispersion according to ( mclaughlin 2000 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total cluster luminosity .",
    "we assign each gc a central imbh assuming two different prescriptions leading to a heavy and a light population of imbhs .",
    "the heavy population ( h scenario ) is obtained using the recipe provided by portegies zwart ( 2005 ) for the runaway collision formation of an imbh in a dense stellar cluster .",
    "the forming imbh mass can be written as : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the mass of the heavy star that initiates the runaway process , @xmath20 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath21 is a runaway efficiency factor .",
    "as shown in figure [ f1 ] , this prescription leads to a typical imbh mass of the order of @xmath22 .",
    "the recipe given by equation ( [ pzwart ] ) is appropriate in the context of imbh formation in young dense star clusters , where the core relaxation time is shorter than the lifetime of the most massive stars ( @xmath23myr ) .",
    "this is not the case for gcs in the mw , which have core relaxation times @xmath24yrs , even though they may have suffered a significant core expansion during their life ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , predicted imbhs are quite massive , and some of them are only marginally consistent with upper limits placed by dynamical modelling of observed density and luminosity profiles of few selected gcs ( see , e.g. , van der marel & anderson 2010 for omega centauri ) . as a suitable alternative , we explore the possibility that each cluster hosts an imbh consistent with a low mass extrapolation of the @xmath25 relation observed in galactic bulges ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bh mass in unit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the gc velocity dispersion in units of 70 km s@xmath30 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows that this prescription leads to a population of much lighter imbhs ( and we will refer to this prescription as l scenario ) . in this case",
    "we place a lower cut to the imbh mass : gcs that contain a central imbh less massive then @xmath31 according to equation ( [ msigma ] ) are simply considered to be void of a central bh , and do not contribute in the calculation .",
    "note that more than 50% of the galactic gcs do not host an imbh according to this recipe .",
    "gcs are known to host an exceptionally high number of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "there are 22 msps detected in 47 tucanae ( hereinafter 47 tuc ) and more than 30 in terzan 5 .",
    "there is , up to date , a total of @xmath32 140 msps discovered in more than 20 gcs , the majority of them being in tight binary systems .",
    "it is worth to notice that ongoing surveys are only sensitive to the brightest pulsars hosted in nearby gcs .",
    "it is therefore possible that many more pulsars than the @xmath33 currently detected are hosted by massive gcs like 47 tuc and terzan 5 .",
    "dynamical modeling of dense clusters shows that dense massive clusters in the mw can host as many as 500 msps ( see detailed discussion in ivanova et al",
    ". 2008a ) . assuming that @xmath34 of the msps are observable because of beaming ( kramer et al .",
    "1998 ; lorimer 2008 and references therein ) , this implies @xmath35 observable msp might be hosted by such clusters , the vast majority of them being below our current detection threshold ( camilo & rasio 2005 ) . the number of potentially observable msps in 47 tuc estimated by camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) by extrapolating the observed msps luminosity function to the faint end is in fact @xmath36 .",
    "note , however , that measurements of the integrated unresolved radio flux from 47 tuc suggest that the faint undetected population might be of the order of just @xmath37 objects ( mcconnell et al .",
    "interestingly , more than half of the observed msps are in binary systems , and are concentrated in the gc cores . assuming a close correlation between low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and the msp formation ( van den heuvel & van paradijs 1988 ) , as supported by the recent observation of a msp binary with a shut - off accretion disk ( archibald et al .",
    "2009 ) , we populate each cluster with a number of msps in binaries scaling as : @xmath38 which is approximately the observed scaling between the number of lmxbs and the gc structural parameters ( pooley et al .",
    "2003 ) ) has a large scatter , and secondly the relation is for lmxb and not for msps .",
    "for example , according to equation ( [ nmsp ] ) one would expect several msps in ngc 6388 , where @xmath39 lmxb have been detected by chandra ( nucita et al .",
    "2008 ) ; however , none has been found to date . ] : the central density @xmath40 , the core size @xmath7 and the velocity dispersion @xmath41 .",
    "the term in parenthesis simply describes the formation rate of close binaries in a dense environment : this is proportional to the squared object density multiplied by the volume and divided by the typical relative velocity between objects . as a study case",
    "we normalize equation ( [ nmsp ] ) to 50 potentially observable ( i.e. , beamed toward the earth , irrespectively of their luminosity ) msps in binaries in the core of 47 tuc .",
    "all our results can be re - normalized by changing this number .",
    "a large population of msps in binaries would be affected by the presence of an imbh in the gc center .",
    "close interactions between the binary and the imbh would cause the tidal break - up of the binary , with one of the two members being ejected from the cluster with high speed and the other being captured in a very eccentric orbit ( hills 1975 , hills 1988 , bromley et al 2006 , sesana haardt & madau 2007 ) .",
    "let us start by modelling the dynamical interactions of a massive object embedded in a population of light field binaries .",
    "the target is an imbh of mass @xmath42 and the bullets are binaries containing a msp of mass @xmath431.4 @xmath44 and a lighter companion of mass @xmath45 .",
    "the binary population is specified by a semimajor axis distribution @xmath46 , by the binary center of mass velocity with respect to the imbh @xmath47 , and by the mass of the companion to the msp @xmath45 .",
    "we denote the binary semimajor axis probability distribution by @xmath48 .",
    "this distribution is derived by fitting the data presented by camilo & rasio ( 2005 ) .",
    "observations show a bimodal binary population , characterized by half of the msps having a very light ( @xmath49 ) and very close ( @xmath50 au ) companion , and the other half being accompanied by heavier stars ( @xmath51 ) in wider orbits ( @xmath52 au , with a long tail extending to @xmath53 au ) .",
    "we fit such distribution by ( i ) an asymmetric landau profile , peaked at 0.005 au , in the range [ 0.0024 au , 0.02 au ] , plus ( ii ) a gaussian profile , centered around 0.026 au , in the range [ 0.02 au , 0.035 au ] .",
    "we denote the center of mass velocity distribution as @xmath54 and we assume it follows a maxwellian distribution with 1-d dispersion @xmath41 .",
    "as we will see below , only the total mass @xmath55 enters in the derivation of the cross section and the interaction rate , and since @xmath56 , we will neglect the @xmath45 dependence in their computation .",
    "the @xmath45 distribution is instead consistently sampled in the evaluation of the ejection velocity , which crucially depends on the mass of the msp companion ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "the relevant lengthscale for computing the break - up cross section and a relative rate is then the tidal break - up radius , defined as @xmath57 we consider a close interaction to be efficient when it leads to the break - up of the binary . in this respect",
    ", @xmath58 does not mark a clear distinction between tidal break - up and binary survival , but there is a smooth transition between the two regimes around @xmath59 , described by a break - up probability function ( hills 1975 ) @xmath60 @xmath61^{-1/3}. \\label{hillspar}\\ ] ] here @xmath62 is the closest approach of the binary center of mass to the imbh .",
    "when @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and it smoothly approaches zero for @xmath65 .",
    "to model the ejection rate of msps , we need to define an interaction cross section , and an ejection timescale . in general the interaction rate for an imbh embedded in a background of field",

    "the range of @xmath62 leading to a disruption depends on @xmath46 , and the focusing depends on @xmath47 .",
    "we then define an effective cross section taking into account for the distributions @xmath48 , @xmath54 and for the disruption probability @xmath72 by writing : @xmath73 finally , equation ( [ rate ] ) can also be rewritten as @xmath74 defining a characteristic interaction timescale @xmath75 . here",

    "i we consider that all the @xmath79 systems were formed in a single burst at @xmath81 . in this case , the evolution of the binary population in each individual gc is simply dictated by the tidal break  up rate , and it is described by an exponential decay : @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the interaction timescale , as defined by equation ( [ tau ] ) , which is different for each cluster ) .",

    "the contribution of each gc to the ejected population of msps is shown in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "if the imbh mass is assigned according to the @xmath25 relation , then only @xmath152 gcs contribute to the halo msp population ejecting at least one object .",
    "interestingly , bhs with masses as low as 100@xmath11 can eject @xmath155 msps during an hubble time . in the h scenario , @xmath156",
    "gcs eject at least 1 msp .",
    "the total numbers of ejected and retained msps are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the number of fast msps ejected in the halo spans almost an order of magnitude , from @xmath121 ( l - ii model ) to @xmath157 ( h - i model ) , this number can be as high as @xmath120 if the ejection probability for the msp is higher than 0.5 , then the probability of ejecting the more massive object is substantially higher than @xmath158 .",
    "this is always the case for our systems , since the msp companion is always a very low mass main sequence star .",
    "however , here we preferred to be conservative and assume equal probability for the ejection of the msp and the low mass companion . ] .",
    "the number of retained binaries containing msps is instead in the range @xmath159 for the different scenarios .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that a population of imbhs would completely devoid msps in binaries residing in gcs . in the most extreme case , @xmath87 of the formed binaries",
    "are disrupted by scattering with the imbh .",
    "this is because , in general , the characteristic size of the gc core is much larger than the typical disruption cross section @xmath68 , and even assuming that the loss cone is always full ( i.e. the nuclear relaxation timescale is much less than the hubble time , which is always the case for the gc cores ) , the imbh does not have enough time to tear apart all the binaries .    as a consistency check ,",
    "we plot in figure [ f6 ] the number of surviving msps in binaries for each gc .",
    "most of the clusters retain the majority of their msps . in particular , even in our h scenario",
    ", we find that 47 tuc would still host @xmath160 observable msps in binaries in its core , while @xmath161 retained msps are expected in terzan 5 ; both numbers are consistent with observations .",
    ".msps in the four different models ( first column ) .",
    "we show the total numbers of produced msps in binary systems ( @xmath162 , column 2 ) , the number of retained msps following binary disruption ( @xmath163 , column 3 ) , and the number of ejected ones ( @xmath164 , column 4 ) .",
    "columns 5 and 6 are the number of msps ejected by imbhs residing in gcs into the mw halo that will be detectable with ska in configuration @xmath165 and @xmath166 , according to simulations described in section 5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the results of our simulations in hand , we seek for a suitable discriminant between halo and disk objects . even though the two populations are quite distinct , this is not a trivial task .",
    "one obvious discriminant is the binary nature : halo msps are isolated , whereas the vast majority of observed disk msps ( about @xmath167 ) are in binaries .",
    "however , there are still far more isolated disk msps than halo msps , and further discriminating properties are necessary . unlike the case of hypervelocity stars in the mw halo ( bromley et al .",
    "2006 , sesana et al .",
    "2007 ) , radial velocities can not be directly measured , and in any case they would be mostly in the range @xmath168 km s@xmath30 , providing just a little ( if any ) discriminant power .",
    "transverse velocities can be measured from the parallax ; however , expected values of @xmath169 mas / yr are the same for both populations . instead of velocity",
    ", it turns out that a better discriminant between the two population is the spatial location of the objects , in particular the distribution of the projected distance @xmath170 of the msps from the disk plane .",
    "the good thing about @xmath170 is that it can be easily measured by ska . in fact , since msps sky locations are known almost exactly , the accuracy in the @xmath170 measurement is directly related to the measurement of the msp distance , which for ska is expected to be better than @xmath171 at 10 kpc ( smits et al .",
    "2011 ) thanks to very precise parallax determination .",
    "halo msps should reflect the distribution of the parent population of gcs and thus many of them are likely to be found at large distances from the disk .",
    "the spatial distribution of disk msp is instead expected to be extremely flattened in the galactic plane , decaying exponentially at large distances . to quantify this concept , for each gc ejected msp population and ska configuration we extract two distinct distributions :    * the _ disk _ only distribution of detectable msps with disk plane distance @xmath172 , with @xmath173 kpc ; * the _ disk@xmath174halo _ distribution of detectable msps , for the same @xmath175 values .",
    "examples of such distributions are given in the upper panels of figure [ f8 ] and numbers are quantified in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the figure highlights that the chance of getting an msp at @xmath176 kpc belonging to the _ disk _ population is almost nil ( dashed lines ) ; conversely , when the _",
    "population is considered , the distributions show a long tail extending to @xmath177 ( solid lines ) .",
    "this is particularly clear by looking at the normalized cumulative distributions ; such distributions are built starting nominally at @xmath178 , down to a specific value @xmath175 , which , as stated above , we place at 3 , 4 and 5 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "the two reported examples highlight the extreme different behavior of the cumulative distributions , which is the starting point of our statistical tests .",
    "the number of msps found at large @xmath170 is already a good indicator of the presence of halo msps , as shown in table [ tab2 ] . here ,",
    "columns 6 and 7 report the average number of msps found at @xmath179 kpc for the _ disk _ and the _ disk+halo _",
    "distribution respectively .",
    "the paucity of _ disk _ pulsars indicates that the detection of a sizable number of msps at large @xmath170 would be a strong hint of a substantial presence of halo msps ejected by gcs . to make our analysis more quantitative , we perform , for each ejection model ( h - i , h - ii , l - i , l - ii ) ska configuration ( @xmath180 ) and @xmath175 ( 3 , 4 , 5 kpc ) , a simple kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test on the @xmath170 distribution predicted by the two populations ( _ disk _ and _ disk+halo _ ) .",
    "we proceed as follow .",
    "we assume that ska observes a _",
    "disk@xmath174halo _ population of msps . to simulate this",
    ", we draw a number of observed msps , @xmath181 , from a gaussian distribution with mean value equal to @xmath182 and variance equal to @xmath183 ; values of @xmath182 are given in table [ tab2 ] for the different cases .",
    "we then contrast the observed @xmath170 distribution to that predicted by the _ disk _ population only and compute the ks indicator @xmath184 .",
    "this namely gives the probability that our _ disk@xmath174halo _ drawn sample is erroneously recognized as being drawn from the _ disk _ only distribution .",
    "we repeat the procedure 100000 times .",
    "the result depends on the specific sample , and examples of the @xmath184 distribution for two selected models are shown in the bottom panels of figure [ f8 ] .",
    "even though the @xmath184 distributions have a large dispersion , their mean and median values are usually small , indicating that a characteristic realization of the _",
    "disk@xmath174halo _ distribution can be identified with high confidence .",
    "results of course depend on the underlying halo population and ska configuration , and also on the adopted value of @xmath175 .",
    "if @xmath175 is too small , then the overall distribution is dominated by the disk population , and the large @xmath170 tail contribution given by halo msps becomes marginal , making the ks test ineffective .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath175 is too large , then the number of detectable msps is very small , making the test ill defined ( at least 4 - 5 datapoints are needed for a trustworthy ks test ) .",
    "we find an @xmath175 range of 3 - 5kpc to be appropriate .",
    "results are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "assuming @xmath185 kpc , median @xmath184 are in the range @xmath186 for all models but l - i-@xmath165 and l - i-@xmath166 , meaning that the halo population is detected at least at a 97% confidence level .",
    "when @xmath187 kpc , numbers of detected msps get smaller , but the cumulative distributions are even more distinct ( see , e.g. , the upper right panels of figure [ f8 ] ) , resulting in @xmath188 for all models , i.e. , in a detection confidence greater than 99% .",
    "@xmath184 values get again bigger for @xmath189 kpc ( not shown in the table ) , because the extremely low number of detected msps undermines the effectiveness of the ks test .",
    "notice that for some specific model we obtain @xmath190 , resulting in a detection confidence @xmath191% ; moreover , results are extremely encouraging even assuming the reduced ska @xmath166 configuration . in all our tests we assumed an underlying disk population of 30000 msps .",
    "this number is somewhat uncertain , but the power of the ks test lies in the fact that it compares cumulative normalized distributions , which remain quite distinct even adding a substantial population of disk msps .",
    "tests on models with 60000 disk msps give somewhat larger ( factor of @xmath192 ) @xmath184 , leaving our main results unchanged .",
    "we stress that in this analysis we considered all the disk msps , including those in binaries ( the vast majority ) .",
    "if we restrict the disk sample to isolated msps , then the number of observable systems is expected to drop by a factor of four , making the halo population even more dominant at high @xmath175 .",
    "this , in turn , will strengthen our identification criterion .",
    "inspired by the detection of several msps in binaries in the core of galactic gcs , we investigated their dynamical interaction with putative imbhs lurking in the center of the same gcs .",
    "as a consequence of three body interactions , msps are ejected in the galactic halo with velocities ( with respect to the host gc ) up to several hundreds km s@xmath30 , sufficient to distribute them into the outer halo , but not to escape the galaxy potential , allowing the formation of a substantial population of fast halo msps .",
    "the detection of such population would be a strong element , albeit indirect , in favor of the presence of imbhs in the center of gcs .",
    "we investigated four ejection scenarios , involving two different imbh populations and msps formation histories .",
    "we considered a high -h- and a low -l- imbh mass functions , consistent with the runaway model of portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and with the low mass end extrapolation of the @xmath25 relation respectively .",
    "we also assumed two different msps formation scenarios , one in which msps are simultaneously generated in a single burst 12gyr ago , and one with a constant msp formation rate along the whole galaxy history . in both cases , the msp population in gcs was normalized to match the observed numbers of msps in close binaries in the clusters terzan 5 and 47 tuc , and then scaled to all other gcs according to their structural parameters .",
    "the investigated scenarios predict between 100 and 600 fast msps wandering in the mw halo , a population that can in principle be detected with future radio surveys .",
    "we emphasize here that all the considered models are consistent with current msp observations in gcs ; that is , even considering efficient binary break - up and msp ejection , gcs retain a substantial population of binaries containing msps , as observed today .    in the spirit of using fast halo msps as a probe of imbhs in gcs",
    ", we checked that such population can not result from alternative channels .",
    "halo msps can be in principle produced by other dynamical ejection mechanisms , such as binary - binary or three body interaction with stellar bhs , or can be relics of the natural evolution of the old halo stellar population .",
    "both channels looks inefficient in producing a sizable population of halo msps , unless several tens of stellar bhs are retained in gcs , or the msp formation efficiency is much higher in the halo than in the disk .",
    "we finally ran fully consistent simulations of the msp population in the galaxy .",
    "we considered 30000 msps distributed in the disk plus several fast halo msp populations predicted by our models .",
    "the disk and the halo populations were averaged over 1000 and 20 realizations respectively .",
    "we simulated observations with ska , taking into account for selection effects and limiting sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "we found the distribution of projected distances from the galactic plane @xmath170 to be an effective discriminant between the two populations .",
    "fast halo msps , in fact , show a significant excess of objects at high @xmath170 , in sharp contrast with standard disk - born msps .",
    "this means that any excess of msps at high @xmath170 would be a strong hint of the presence of a different msp population .",
    "here we showed that msp ejection from gc , due to dynamical interactions with imbhs , would easily produce such excess , and can therefore leave a clear imprint in future radio surveys .",
    "we quantified the statistical significance of halo msp detection by performing tests on synthetic samples drawn from the disk plus halo distribution .",
    "results shown in figure [ f8 ] and table [ tab2 ] are very encouraging .",
    "if we isolate the distribution of msps observed at distances from the galactic plane larger than @xmath185 kpc , the halo population is , on average , detected at a 97% confidence level for all models but l - i-@xmath165 and l - i-@xmath166 . when @xmath187 kpc , detection confidence is boosted to better than 99% for all models .",
    "this is also true for the reduced ska @xmath166 configuration , indicating that such detection will be easily feasible .",
    "our analysis is admittedly oversimplified in several respects .",
    "most importantly , the disk msp population is hard to model , since @xmath121 objects has been detected to date .",
    "this introduces considerable uncertainties in our results .",
    "note however that , unless disk msps are far more numerous than suggested by present observation or extend far above the mw disk height , our basic result , that an excess of msps located at large distances from the galactic plane would strongly support dynamical ejection due to imbh residing in gcs , remains unaltered .",
