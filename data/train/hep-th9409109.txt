    "nonlinear sigma models have had great success in describing low energy qcd phenomenology .",

    "such linear potentials can arise as tension - carrying flux tubes  between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for yang - mills qcd , or between any unscreened sources which persist in low energy effective theories .",
    "the conventional skyrme model , induced by the global flavor symmetry breaking @xmath6 , supports neither unscreened sources nor flux tubes .",

    "@xmath1 has no gauge anomaly , and thus requires no right - handed quarks ; however , its @xmath11 anomaly breaks baryon number to @xmath2 .",

    "this defect classification makes physical sense : for baryons , identified with antibaryons because real quarks are identified with antiquarks ; and for flux tubes , whose @xmath2 structure emerges as a response to external spinor sources , which can be screened by fundamental quarks only in even combinations .    in this paper , we elaborate on our recent work with manohar @xcite , constructing the flux tubes in this theory and showing that their interactions with skyrmions and spinor sources obey heuristic expectations .",
    "confinement of spinor sources in an @xmath1 gauge theory can thus manifest itself in the low energy sigma model , through relic phenomenology in the presence of unscreened sources .",
    "we organize our results as follows : section ii derives the unique flux tube form with minimal energy ; section iii examines its classical stability and dynamics ; section iv its quantum stability and spectrum ; and section v its interactions and relationships with other fundamental objects in the theory .",
    "the early sections reveal that minimal flux tubes lie in a planar subspace of the vacuum manifold @xmath26 ; while section v discusses why our flux tubes are alice strings , despite ambiguities in defining parallel transport around them ; why they carry skyrmion number when twisted ; and how they can be viewed as mediating the confinement of spinor sources .",

    "we take as the simplest representative @xmath244 and @xmath313 .",
    "( the specific case @xmath314 has additional degenerate vacua , non - coincident with those of the pion mass term , given by @xmath315 ; however , these reduce to the pion mass vacua above when more families are added . )",
    "thus our boundary condition @xmath237 induces the full boundary conditions at infinite radius : @xmath316 , @xmath317 ; corresponding to @xmath249 for all @xmath80 , in our original variables .",
    "the rotational energy @xmath318 generates spatially - dependent corrections to the equations of motion for @xmath255 .",
    "however , these corrections trivialize for the nonplanar variables @xmath227 , given our boundary conditions @xmath245 .",
    "we show this as follows : the rotational energy [ erotfin ] introduces an additional term @xmath319 into the right hand side of the equation of motion [ eomnonplan ] for @xmath255 .",
    "this term is generally quite complicated ; however , when the nonplanar @xmath308 assume their asymptotic values of zero , it simplifies . for a single @xmath320 ( before multiplying by the jacobian )",
    ", it becomes @xmath321 asymptotically , where @xmath322 , all @xmath323 vanish , and the full equation of motion [ eomnonplan ] is again sourceless .",
    "this gives asymptotic solutions for the nonplanar @xmath255 which are again bessel functions of order zero  implying , for finite energy , that @xmath227 and all its derivatives ( or @xmath308 and all its derivatives ) vanish at infinite radius .",
    "however , given nonplanar terms that obey @xmath324 the perturbations @xmath323 vanish , regardless of the planar field @xmath325 .",
    "so , as for pion mass stabilization , equation [ eomnonplan ] remains sourceless as we propagate it inward to the origin , giving @xmath227 that vanish identically .",
    "thus the planar vacuum @xmath326 survives quantum fluctuations due to zero modes .",
    "its static limit retains the form [ sigralform ] , with @xmath257 varying only over a planar @xmath166 subgroup .",
    "it has classical energy , from equation [ erotfin ] , @xmath327 where @xmath328 describe the orientation of the zero mode rotation @xmath286 relative to @xmath329 .",
    "for a flux tube stabilized by @xmath217-rotation , where @xmath288 , the rotational terms in @xmath330 deform the nonlinear equation of motion for @xmath260 .",
    "classically , we can rescale @xmath280 to set @xmath331 ( a rescaling unnecessary when @xmath332 ) .",
    "this gives energy as a monotonic function of @xmath333  which measures the component of @xmath334 @xmath217-dependence due to slip dislocation , where @xmath335 rotates about its core in a single internal space plane @xmath161 , but starts at the @xmath336-axis with changing offset angle @xmath337 .",
    "its converse , @xmath338 , measures the twist dislocation in @xmath335 : the extent to which @xmath339 rotates the internal space plane , @xmath340 , in which @xmath335 cycles about its core .",
    "numerical solutions for the @xmath217-stabilized @xmath260 are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "their asymptotic behavior agrees with analytic limits : inside the core , @xmath260 falls linearly from its boundary value of @xmath195 at the origin ; while outside , it scales as the hyperbolic bessel function @xmath341 for @xmath342 .",
    "that is , the flux tube becomes more compact as either @xmath280 or @xmath343 grows . as in the mass stabilization case ,",
    "shrinking core sizes correlate with growing tensions .",
    "thus we see , from figure 3 , that the value @xmath344 is favored , and twisting dislocations cost less energy than their slip - offset counterparts .",
    "figure 4 confirms the flux tube s tendency both to shrink and to gain energy with increasing rotational frequency , and shows how significant the rotational deformation of @xmath193 is .",
    "thus the tension not only acquires rotational energy terms , @xmath345 it also contains hidden rotational dependence through deformations of the ground state tension @xmath346 and moments of inertia @xmath347 .",
    "we explore these deformations in figure 5 , showing that @xmath346 grows linearly with @xmath280 , due to flux tube compression .",
    "the moments of inertia instead fall rapidly , dropping by a factor of five as @xmath280 grows from @xmath56 to @xmath148 , before stabilizing at roughly @xmath348 for @xmath349 .",
    "we show below that this range @xmath350 is typical of quantum rotational excitations of the flux tube ; thus we are justified in neglecting rotational deformation of @xmath347 over this range .",
    "finally , we note that the geodesic parametrization assumed above for the rotation @xmath286 , while useful for discussing the flux tube s classical limit , does not restrict our analysis .",
    "any function @xmath286 over @xmath351 induces the energy [ ezmfin ] , with @xmath352 defined by @xmath353      from the previous section , there are two ways to stabilize the flux tube : by exploiting the pion mass term in the lagrangian or by @xmath217-rotation .",
    "these give the two classical solutions @xmath112 ( equation [ sigfinform ] ) and @xmath354 ( equation [ defsigt ] , with @xmath355 ) .",
    "both have rotational zero modes induced by @xmath356 .",
    "we now quantize the spectrum of these zero modes to find the flux tube s quantum numbers and lowlying excitations @xcite .",
    "quantizing @xmath354 is a complicated task , because it involves two rotations , the @xmath217 and @xmath357 rotations .",
    "furthermore , there is no physical input for the @xmath217-rotation frequency @xmath280 .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to quantizing the mass - stabilized solution @xmath112 .    equations [ rotten ] and [ defoms ] determine a two - dimensional lagrangian for the flux tube : @xmath358 where @xmath359 is a ground state tension and @xmath360 measures dimensionless length along the flux tube . the moments of inertia @xmath361 and @xmath362 come from equation [ ezmfin ] : @xmath363    we note that form [ mqskyrme ] for the lagrangian comes from only two facts : from the confinement of @xmath20 to the planar @xmath364 subgroup in internal space ; and from cylindrical symmetry in physical space .",
    "the skyrmion in this theory , which we discuss in the following section , shares these characteristics .",
    "thus its one - dimensional lagrangian @xmath365 also has form [ mqskyrme ] , with @xmath359 , @xmath361 and @xmath362 dependent upon skyrmion dynamics .",
    "to quantize such a lagrangian , we must do two things : first , we must understand the transformation properties of @xmath20 under the symmetries of @xmath366 ; and second , we must write @xmath366 in terms of invariants of the quantized noether charges of those symmetries .",
    "the first task is facilitated by considering the most general form of @xmath20 on the vacuum manifold : @xmath367 where @xmath368 is an orthogonal matrix encoding the isospin rotation due to @xmath369-conjugation : @xmath370 while @xmath371 is defined for all @xmath372 generators @xmath373 , it breaks into block diagonal form , @xmath374 , over the space of unbroken and broken generators respectively .    for the general form @xmath375 , the lagrangian [ mqskyrme ] involves a general sum @xmath376 .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under global @xmath377 , implemented by either left or right multiplications @xmath378 or @xmath379 . for infinitesimal transformations",
    "@xmath380 , @xmath375 transforms as : @xmath381\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta_ra & = & a(-i2\\epsilon_ht_h ) \\ \\ \\longleftrightarrow\\ \\ \\delta_r\\sigma(x_i , t)=-i\\epsilon_h\\",

    "the right transformation corresponds to @xmath14 isospin rotation in the body fixed frame , with noether charge @xmath384 . to understand the physical interpretation of @xmath384",

    "these properties identify planar isospin rotations with spatial @xmath217-rotations .",
    "we see this in two steps : the planarity of @xmath132 reduces equations [ da ] and [ dra ] , when @xmath390 , to @xmath391 which the jacobian relating @xmath132 to @xmath392 , at fixed @xmath393 , equates with spatial @xmath217-rotation : @xmath394 thus @xmath395 , which generates planar body - centered isospin rotations @xmath396 , must equal the defect s spin operator @xmath397 , generating spatial @xmath217-rotations .",
    "other isospin rotations , which destroy the planarity of @xmath132 , are distinct from other spatial rotations , which change the defect s axis of axisymmetry .    under right and left infinitesimal transformations of @xmath286 , the rotations @xmath398 , which give physical coordinates for @xmath375 on the vacuum manifold , transform as @xmath399 that is , @xmath398 is left or right multiplied by @xmath400 .",
    "this shows how isospin rotation acting directly on the space of broken generators can obey an @xmath383 algebra  specifically the @xmath383 algebra which occurs as a subalgebra of @xmath74 in the adjoint representation , restricted to the block - diagonal component @xmath401 .    to find @xmath382 and @xmath384 , we compute the variation of the lagrangian under the two infinitesimal transformations : @xmath402 this gives @xmath403    we can now write the defect hamiltonian in terms of the physical quantized noether charges : the isospin @xmath404 and angular momentum @xmath405 . combining the lagrangian [ mqskyrme ] with noether charges [ lr ]",
    "yields a hamiltonian dependent on @xmath406 and @xmath407 , where @xmath300 are planes intersecting @xmath161 in only one line .",
    "however , the defect @xmath408 is invariant under a subgroup @xmath409 of @xmath14 , acting on the subspace @xmath410 orthogonal to @xmath161 .",
    "this implies two things : @xmath411 ; and the defect s allowed quantum states @xmath412 must contain a singlet under the @xmath409 subgroup . for @xmath413 , this excludes spinor representations  constraining the skyrmions and flux tubes to be bosonic .",
    "lastly , because @xmath404 is simply a rotation of @xmath414 , and @xmath415 , we write the hamiltonian as @xmath416 subject to the constraints above : @xmath415 , with bosonic defects for @xmath413 .    using the numerical results of section iva",
    ", we may be more explicit about the flux tube s quantized energy levels . relating the rotational energies of equation [ finalh ] to their counterparts in the tension [ rotten ] ( for dimensionful @xmath217 ) gives @xmath417 thus @xmath280 assumes values @xmath350 for quantized zero modes . over this range , @xmath418 and @xmath362 vary little but @xmath359 is described by the linear fit @xmath419 , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "thus our model predicts @xmath420 for the allowed excited states @xmath421 , and @xmath422 for the ground state of the flux tube .",
    "we now consider how flux tubes interact with fundamental objects in our low energy theory .",
    "first , we establish that flux tubes can be alice strings  forcing some charges and particle wave functions to become double - valued . like gauge theories with alice strings and monopoles ,",
    "our sigma model has twisted flux loops which form point defects .",
    "we construct these defects  the skyrmions  and demonstrate their nontrivial topology .",
    "we then consider how they interact with the flux tubes , showing that only topologically trivial combinations of two flux tubes can end on skyrmions .",
    "this suggests the physical interpretation that , while the baryons in this theory are not confined , the spinor sources which combine to form them are , with confinement mediated by the @xmath2 flux tubes joining them .",
    "first we consider twisted flux tubes .",
    "we note that our flux tubes may share the defining property of alice strings , which arise in the symmetry - breaking of certain gauge theories .",
    "@xcite alice strings have unbroken symmetries which preserve a local vev but can not be extended globally , since they become multivalued when parallel transported around the spatially varying vev of the string .",
    "this `` alice '' nature is not topologically invariant , but depends on the specific wilson line integral producing the string s asymptotic winding .",
    "whether our flux tubes have this trait is similarly ambiguous : using the physical embedding [ sigralform ] of the flux tube , we can take @xmath423 .",
    "this gives parallel transported unbroken generators @xmath424 that are double - valued in @xmath191 for each radius .",
    "however , all generators can be made single - valued by choosing instead @xmath425 which induces the same flux tube @xmath20 .    because @xmath20 can be viewed as an alice string",
    ", we might expect it to share a property of gauged alice strings in models with monopoles : that twisted string loops support monopole charge . for gauged alice strings ,",
    "this is necessary , as monopoles alter their charge when passing through string loops ; moreover , specific examples indicate that twisted alice loops can carry a single unit of monopole charge .",
    "@xcite for global alice strings , the suggestion arises by analogy . in our case",
    ", it gains further support from the hidden gauge character of the low energy global theory .",
    "specifically , we can recast the flavor - dependent quark mass @xmath20 in the usual way , as an interaction between flavor gauge fields @xmath426 and shifted quarks @xmath427 @xcite this accomplishes two goals : it equates skyrmion number with anomalous baryon current , while identifying the flux tube with a gauged string , whose wilson line integral is @xmath428 however , the alice ambiguity persists : choosing @xmath429 double - valued gives a gauge theory with wilson loop @xmath430 , making both the quarks @xmath431 and the generators @xmath432 double - valued .",
    "a single - valued choice for @xmath429 produces instead single - valued quarks and generators , with wilson loop @xmath433 .",
    "this ambiguity can be resolved physically , by considering adiabatic transport of quarks around the flux tube .",
    "@xcite under such transport , the quarks remain in their mass eigenstates .",
    "these are governed by two terms : a flavor - independent bare majorana mass @xmath434 ( breaking @xmath435 explicitly ) and the flavor - dependent majorana mass @xmath436 , where @xmath437 is the @xmath438-breaking vev . the two determine mass eigenstates that are double - valued in @xmath191 .",
    "however , the states have mass splitting @xmath439 , where we have chosen @xmath434 real . thus the quarks are degenerate , and unaffected by transport around the string , unless the vev @xmath437 is misaligned in phase with the bare mass @xmath434 . in that case , quarks at finite radius have double - valued wave functions and aharonov - bohm scatter off the flux tube , which we identify as an alice string . where @xmath440 are the quark mass eigenvalues .",
    "thus we rely on an asymptotic regime inside the flux tube , in which @xmath441 the flux tube background affects general quark wave functions more subtly .",
    "since the mass eigenstates depend explicitly on @xmath191 , off - diagonal @xmath442 terms appear in the quark equations of motion , mixing mass eigenstates at small radius .",
    "this causes corrections to maximal aharonov - bohm scattering , much as in @xcite . ]",
    "motivated by its gauge theoretic counterpart , we calculate the skyrmion number of a twisted flux tube : @xmath443 where @xmath444 imposing @xmath195-periodicity in @xmath217 constrains @xmath145 : for planar @xmath445 , @xmath145 must be integral ; for nonplanar @xmath446 , it must be even .",
    "thus any twisted flux loop can deform to the planar flux loop @xmath447 , which takes values only in the two - flavor subspace @xmath448 this simplification allows us to identify the loop s @xmath39 index with its hopf number , _",
    "i.e. _ the linking number between any two fibers of constant @xmath20 in physical space .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this linking number is precisely @xmath145  the number of times a nontrivial fiber @xmath449 twists around the loop s core , which has @xmath450 .",
    "thus flux loops with an @xmath451 planar twist form fundamental skyrmions ; flux loops with nonplanar twist have @xmath452 , which is trivial for @xmath453 .",
    "a nicer parametrization of the skyrmion stems from the exact sequence @xmath454 this implies that fundamental skyrmions in the theory can be constructed from the fundamental skyrmions @xmath455 in @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath456 are the radius and unit direction vector in 3-space , and @xmath457 approaches @xmath195 at @xmath180 and zero at @xmath179 .",
    "this determines an axisymmetric skyrmion @xmath458 after a global spatial rotation fixing the @xmath217-axis as the axis of spatial axisymmetry . in the @xmath459-plane , this gives @xmath460 comparing with equation [ sigrexp ] for the flux tube allows us to identify the angular winding @xmath461 of a flux tube with that of a skyrmion in the @xmath459-plane .",
    "thus , if their radial boundary conditions coincided , we could deform the lower hemisphere of the skyrmion into a flux tube . however , because both @xmath260 and @xmath462 vary from @xmath56 to @xmath195 over this plane , the skyrmion can not end in a single flux tube .",
    "the boundary conditions instead allow the skyrmion to join only to flux tube configurations where @xmath193 ranges from @xmath56 to @xmath463  that is , configurations with two flux tubes , deformable to the trivial configuration .",
    "thus skyrmions can not be confined in this theory .",
    "however , objects which combine to form skyrmions can interact with the flux tubes .",
    "such `` half - skyrmions '' could arise as external spinor sources in the underlying theory .",
    "they should be confined , as fundamentals can not screen them . as mappings on @xmath8 , they appear in our theory precisely as half - skyrmions , that is , as objects of the form [ skyrmion ] with @xmath464 ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath465 .",
    "such objects are not defects in the conventional sense , since they have linearly divergent energy  just like an unscreened point source .",
    "their boundary conditions allow them to join to their opposite winding counterparts via single flux tubes , confining their linearly divergent energy to a length scale set by the tube length .",
    "we thus see that confinement of sources in an @xmath1 gauge theory can induce a relic phenomenology , which persists in the low energy skyrme model .",
    "we thank aneesh manohar , david kaplan , tom imbo , sidney coleman and glenn boyd for helpful conversations .",
    "this work was supported by the department of energy under grant no .",
    "doe - fg03 - 90er40546 and by the university of california president s postdoctoral fellowship program .      in this appendix",
    ", we show that trivializations [ gformgen ] of the loop @xmath102 produce minimal flux tubes only when @xmath466 .",
    "we do this by generalizing the analysis following equation [ gformgeod ] for arbitrary @xmath158  only to find that consistency and energy considerations restore the restriction @xmath466 .",
    "note that conjugation by @xmath158 rotates @xmath467 in @xmath383 : @xmath468 since @xmath158 is real and orthogonal , @xmath469 is just a real unit vector , like @xmath470 @xmath139 then conjugates this rotated generator , giving equation [ rotth ] with the substitution @xmath471 this fully conjugated generator must become @xmath472 at @xmath473 , to produce the loop @xmath142 .",
    "this occurs only if @xmath474 for each @xmath75 , with @xmath475 we note that these matching conditions depend only on a basis choice fixing @xmath139 in the @xmath147 plane . rotations of @xmath139 within that plane , for example taking @xmath476 , change the details of equation [ rotth ] , but not the coefficients of @xmath477 and its orthogonal generators ; and these coefficients alone fix the matching [ deflamjk ] .",
    "these matching conditions can not be achieved by orthogonal conjugation of an arbitrary generator @xmath105 .",
    "a first constraint stems from the reality of @xmath478 .",
    "this allows a nonvanishing @xmath149 only when the relevant exponential gives @xmath479 . for @xmath451 ,",
    "this forces @xmath480 for @xmath481  splitting both @xmath115 and @xmath482 into two commuting blocks .",
    "the @xmath483 block is unaffected by @xmath126-conjugation , and changes @xmath96 only by an overall right multiplication , which leaves @xmath484 invariant .",
    "thus , for @xmath451 , @xmath485 again produces all nontrivial loops @xmath96 .",
    "equation [ hconj ] places more subtle constraints on @xmath105 , related to consistency of the diagonal reduction @xmath486 for all @xmath487 this is solved , for independent @xmath488 , only when @xmath489 is itself diagonal : @xmath490 with @xmath491 real .",
    "this constrains the matching conditions attainable by nonzero @xmath149 to @xmath492 note that our @xmath488 are effectively independent , since the relation [ deflamjk ] holds for all global rotations of @xmath149 that leave @xmath139 in the @xmath493plane .",
    "such rotations map a single generator in any of the three matching classes  @xmath75 coincident with @xmath147;@xmath75 intersecting @xmath147 in a single line ; and @xmath75 disjoint from @xmath147  to the entire class , in arbitrary linear combinations .",
    "thus , for @xmath494 only two possibilities are consistent with the matching conditions [ deflamjk ] .",
    "we can have nonvanishing @xmath149 in the cross planes @xmath495 with @xmath496 however , this precludes nonvanishing @xmath149 outside the cross planes : @xmath497 , for all @xmath498 , implies @xmath499 for all @xmath500 .",
