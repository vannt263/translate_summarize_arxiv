    "quantum entanglement is of vital importance in achieving tasks of quantum information processing and transmission @xcite .",
    "most of the practical quantum computation and quantum communication tasks require that the separated parties in distant locations share the maximally entangled state @xcite .",
    "especially , multipartite entangled states have many important applications in quantum computation @xcite and quantum communication , such as controlled teleportation @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite , quantum state sharing @xcite , and so on .",
    "all these tasks require multipartite entangled states to set up the quantum channel between legitimate participants in quantum communication",
    ". however , with local operations and classical communication , the two users in quantum communication can not create entanglement .",
    "if they want to share the entanglement separately , they have to create the entangled states locally and transmit them in a quantum channel . in a practical transmission",
    ", the channel noise can not be avoided , which will make a maximally entangled state become a mixed one .",
    "this will decrease the fidelity of quantum teleportation or make quantum communication insecure .",
    "entanglement purification provides us a powerful tool to distil high - fidelity entangled states from less entangled ones @xcite . the first entanglement purification protocol , which is based on the quantum controlled - not ( cnot ) logic operations , was proposed by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite in 1996 for purifying a two - qubit werner state .",
    "so far , most of entanglement purification protocols @xcite are focused on bipartite entangled quantum systems and there are only several multipartite entanglement protocols , including high - dimension entanglement protocols @xcite as the latter is more complicated than the former . in 1998 , murao _",
    "et al_. @xcite proposed the first multipartite entanglement purification protocol with cnot logic operations for quantum systems originally in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state .",
    "this protocol was extended to high - dimensional multipartite quantum systems in 2007 @xcite .",
    "they use some generalized xor gates to substitute the cnot gates to fulfill their protocol .    until now ,",
    "most of the purification protocols are based on the photons as they are manipulated easily . on the other hand ,",
    "conduction electrons can also be used to achieve quantum communication and computation processes since beenakker _",
    "@xcite broke through the obstacle of the no - going theorem @xcite in 2004 .",
    "an electron acts as a qubit in both charge degree of freedom and spin degree of freedom .",
    "if one measures the charge degree of freedom of an electron quantum system , it will leave its spin degree of freedom unaffected . by means of charge",
    "detections @xcite , beenakker _",
    "@xcite designed a protocol for a cont gate between electronic qubits .",
    "moreover , people have constructed entangled spins @xcite , achieved the entanglement concentration @xcite , prepared cluster states and designed a multipartite entanglement analyzer @xcite with charge detections of electron quantum systems .",
    "a bipartite entanglement purification protocol was also presented in 2005 @xcite , although their protocol is only used to purify the werner state , similar to the original entanglement purification protocol by bennett _",
    "et al . _ for photon pairs",
    "after each purification step , they have to add another bilateral @xmath0 operations to recover the mixed state to werner state in order to perform the next purification step , which make its efficiency low @xcite .    in this paper , we present a multipartite entanglement purification for electrons in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger state based on their spins and their charges , resorting to charge detections and electron polarizing beam splitters . in this scheme ,",
    "charge detections play the role of a parity check .",
    "the whole purification scheme can be divided into two steps , i.e. , bit - flip error purification and phase - flip error purification .",
    "it dose not need to add another operation to recover the mixed state to werner state after each purifying step .",
    "that is , it is easier than the only one entanglement purification scheme for two - electron system @xcite , and it will have a practical application in solid quantum computation and communication .",
    "before we start to explain our purification scheme , we first introduce a basic element for entanglement purification scheme , i.e. , a parity - check gate .",
    "parity - check gates can be used to construct a bell - state analyzer and a cnot gate @xcite . in fig.1 , the polarizing beam splitter ( pbs )",
    "is used to transmit an electron in the spin - up state @xmath1 and reflect an electron in the spin - down state @xmath2 .",
    "the charge detector ( c ) can distinguish the occupation number one from the occupation number 0 and 2 , but it can not distinguish the electron numbers between 0 and 2 .",
    "that is , it can distinguish the occupation number even or odd . let us suppose that two polarization qubits @xmath3 and @xmath4 initially in the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and they interact with each other on the pbs .",
    "the whole state of the two electrons will evolve to @xmath7 one observes immediately that the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 will lead the charge detection to have the charge occupation number @xmath10 as each electron passes through a different path after the first pbs .",
    "the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 will lead the charge detection to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . the charge detection can not distinguish 0 and 2 , and it will show the same result , i.e. , @xmath13 for simplicity .",
    "the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be distinguished from @xmath11 and @xmath12 by the different outcomes of the charge detection .",
    "so this device can be used to accomplish a parity check on a two - electron system .",
    "that is , one can get @xmath15 from the outport @xmath16 if @xmath10 and get @xmath17 if @xmath13 .     and reflect an electron in the spin - down state @xmath2 , respectively.,width=302 ]    now , let us detail how this entanglement purification scheme works for multipartite electron systems . a multipartite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz )",
    "state for spin 1/2 systems can be described as @xmath18 we first take three - particle electron systems in ghz states as an example to show the principle of this multipartite entanglement purification scheme and then extend to the case of @xmath19-particle systems .",
    "there are eight three - particle ghz states , i.e. , @xmath20 here the subscripts a , b , and c represent the three electrons belonging to the three parities , say alice , bob , and charlie , respectively . initially , we suppose that the original ghz state transmitted is @xmath21 .",
    "the noisy channel will degrade the state and make the initial state be a mixed one .",
    "for example , the state @xmath21 may become @xmath22 , say a bit - flip error , or become @xmath23 , say a phase - flip error . sometimes both a bit - flip error and",
    "a phase - flip error will take place such as @xmath24 .",
    "so the task of purifying three - electron entangled systems can be divided into two step , i.e. purifying the bit - flip error and the phase - flip error .",
    "the principle of this multipartite entanglement purification for electron systems is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we first discuss the purification of bit - flip errors .",
    "suppose that an ensemble @xmath25 shared by alice , bob , and charlie after the transmission over a noisy channel is @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the fidelity of the state @xmath28 after it is transmitted over a noisy channel and we suppose that a bit - flip error takes place on the first electron with a probability of @xmath29 .",
    "in each step , each of the three parties will operate his two electrons and each electron comes from one of the mixed state @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in fig.2 , we denote the two mixed states @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "then the electrons @xmath32 and @xmath33 belong to alice , @xmath34 and @xmath35 belong to bob , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 belong to charlie . from eq.([ensemblerho ] ) , the state of the quantum system composed of the six electrons @xmath38 can be viewed as the mixture of four pure states : it is in the state @xmath39 with a probability of @xmath40 , in the state @xmath41 and @xmath42 with an equal probability of @xmath43 , and in the state @xmath44 with a probability of @xmath45 . after the parity - check gates , these three parties compare the parity of their electrons .",
    "they choose the cases that all of them obtain the outcomes with the same parity , i.e. , they all obtain the even - parity ( @xmath10 ) result or the odd - parity ( @xmath13 ) result .",
    "we discuss the even - parity case first .",
    "the whole system is in a mixed state by mixing two pure states , i.e. , @xmath46 with a probability of @xmath47 and @xmath48 with a probability of @xmath49 .",
    "the cross - combinations @xmath41 and @xmath42 never lead all the three parties to have the same parity and can be eliminated automatically . in the spatial modes @xmath50 , hadamard ( h ) operations are performed on the electrons @xmath31 , which will lead to the transformation @xmath51 after performing an @xmath52 operation on each of the electrons @xmath31 , eq.([even - partiy1 ] ) and eq.([even - partiy2 ] ) become @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4}[(\\vert \\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle +    \\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle + \\vert \\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle + \\vert \\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ ; \\vert \\downarrow\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle)+(\\vert \\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle -    \\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ ; \\vert \\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle + \\vert \\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle + \\vert \\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle)],\\nonumber\\\\    -|\\downarrow\\rangle)(|\\uparrow\\rangle + |\\downarrow\\rangle)^{\\otimes2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ ; |\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle(|\\uparrow\\rangle + |\\downarrow\\rangle)(|\\uparrow\\rangle-|\\downarrow\\rangle)^{\\otimes2}]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4}[(\\vert \\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle +    \\rangle + \\vert \\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\ ; \\vert \\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle - \\vert \\downarrow\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle)+(\\vert",

    "if they obtain the outcomes @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 , they will obtain the ghz state @xmath59 with a probability of @xmath47 and the ghz state @xmath60 .",
    "that is , alice , bob , and charlie will get a new ensemble @xmath61 with the fidelity of @xmath62 when @xmath27 by keeping the electron systems @xmath63 if they only obtain one of the four outcomes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 . in this time ,",
    "alice , bob , and charlie need only flip the relative phase of the electron system @xmath68 and will obtain the ensemble @xmath61 .",
    "on the other hand , if alice , bob , and charlie all obtain an odd parity , they will get the state @xmath69 with a probability of @xmath47 and the state @xmath70 with a probability of @xmath71 .",
    "compared with eq.([even - partiy1 ] ) and ( [ even - partiy2 ] ) , alice , bob , and charlie only need to add a bit - flip operation on each of the three qubits @xmath31 and they can get the same result as that with the even parity .    by far , we have discussed the principle of the purification of the bit - flip errors for three - electron systems .",
    "this method can also be extended to purify the bit - flip errors in multipartite entangled systems .",
    "for example , the initial state of an @xmath19-electron quantum system can be described as : @xmath72 suppose a bit - flip error may take place in the first electron .",
    "after transmission , each party makes a parity check on his two electrons coming from two entangled quantum systems and they all choose the same parity by classical communication , shown in fig.2 .",
    "now , let us suppose they all choose the even parity case and then the original mixed state system becomes @xmath73 with a probability of @xmath47 and latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     with a probability of @xmath71 . after the h operations on the @xmath75 modes , eq.([correctn ] ) and eq.([errorn ] )",

    "they will get the same result with a phase - flip operation on each @xmath19-electron system kept if the number of the outcomes @xmath2 is odd .",
    "we have fully described the principle of bit - flip error purification on the first electron .",
    "if the bit - flip error takes place on other electrons , we can purify these errors in the same way and will get the same result like those discussed above .",
    "now we start to explain the principle of the phase - flip error purification in the present scheme .",
    "usually , during the transmission , the relative phase between several entangled electrons are sensitive to path length instabilities , which have to be kept constant .",
    "this problem is analogous to the optical system for quantum communications @xcite .",
    "phase - flip errors can not be purified directly , but it can be converted into bit - flip errors .",
    "for example , the eight ghz states shown in eq.([ghzstate ] ) can be transformed into the following eight states by adding an @xmath52 operation on each electron , i.e. , @xmath82 suppose a phase - flip error may occur in the first electron and the initial state after the electron systems are transmitted over a noisy channel becomes a mixed state as follows @xmath83 after the transformation by adding an @xmath52 operation on each electron , eq.([phaseerror1 ] ) becomes @xmath84 it is interesting to find that in the state @xmath85 , the number of @xmath2 in each items is even , but it is odd in the state @xmath86 .",
    "we also find that all the ghz states with the superscript @xmath87 in eq.([phaseflipstate ] ) have the even number of @xmath2 but have the odd number of @xmath2 for @xmath88 .",
    "now we detail the principle of the phase - flip error purification , shown in fig.2 . for two pairs @xmath30 and @xmath31 picked out from the ensemble @xmath89",
    ", their state can be viewed as the mixture of four pure states : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 with the probabilities of @xmath40 , @xmath43 , @xmath43 , and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "each party makes a parity - check measurement on his two electrons with charge detection and then all parties check their results by classical communication .",
    "they only choose the case that all of them get the even parity and they discard the other cases .",
    "in this way , the cross - combinations @xmath93 and @xmath94 are eliminated automatically and the remaining items are @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the probabilities of @xmath40 and @xmath45 , respectively . in order to get the three - electron entangled state @xmath85",
    ", the parties first perform an @xmath52 operation on each of the three electrons @xmath31 , which will make @xmath97 and @xmath98 evolve as @xmath99 @xmath100 then they measure their electrons @xmath101 ,",

    "first , phase - flip errors can be converted into bit - flip errors with an @xmath52 operation on each electron .",
    "second , each parity perform a parity check on his two electrons and all parties keep their electron system with the same parity . finally , they measure the electrons in the lower modes with the basis @xmath112 after all the parties perform an @xmath52 operation on each of the electrons in the lower modes .",

    "( [ ensemblerho ] ) and ( [ phaseerror1 ] ) .",

    "the state @xmath119 contains both bit - flip errors and phase - flip errors .",
    "alice , bob , and charlie can purify first the bit - flip error on the first particle and then the bit - flip error on the second particle , whose principle is similar to the case with only the bit - flip error on the first particle . in this way",
    ", alice , bob , and charlie can purify the bit - flip errors on an arbitrary position , as discussed in ref .",

    "charge detection has played a prominent role in constructing the parity - check gate , and also it is the key element of the present purification protocol .",
    "it has been realized by means of point contacts in a two - dimensional electron gas .",
