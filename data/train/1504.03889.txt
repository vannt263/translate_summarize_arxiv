    "emulsions  mixtures of two immiscible fluids  are ubiquitous systems with many applications in the food , oil , and cosmetics industries . at the microscopic level ,",
    "an emulsion consists of droplets of one fluid embedded in a host fluid ; the droplets are held in an equilibrium spherical shape by the interfacial tension between the two fluids .",
    "emulsions with anisotropic droplets are of interest because for some applications , e.g. particle filtering in porous media@xcite , performance is improved with increasing aspect ratio .",
    "anisotropic particles are also known to be more easily absorbed by cells , thus being effective as drug delivery systems@xcite .",
    "additionally , ellipsoids fill space more efficiently than spheres@xcite , and through chemical functionalization , are a valuable component in the nano - architecture of hierarchical structures@xcite .",
    "a mechanism for sculpting stable shaped droplets exists in pickering emulsions , where the constituent droplets are stabilized by colloidal particles adsorbed at the interface@xcite .",
    "the particles are strongly bound to the surface because they reduce the interfacial tension between the two immiscible phases@xcite .",
    "non - spherical shapes can be produced by a sequence of deformation , adsorption , relaxation and arrest as follows : following an initial deformation , for example by an applied electric field@xcite or by the coalescence of two droplets@xcite ; during this process additional particles may become adsorbed on the interface from the host fluid .",
    "the droplet then relaxes towards the equilibrium spherical shape , reducing the surface area and causing the particles to become more densely packed .",
    "if the surface coverage of colloids is sufficiently high , they will become crowded and arrest the shape evolution of the droplet before a spherical shape is reached@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to identify the role that the anisotropic curvature present in an ellipsoid plays on the ordering of the particles .",
    "we assume the particles interact purely through volume exclusion .",
    "the quality of the packing of the final state , measured globally by coverage fraction as well as locally by coordination number , depends on this ratio : as @xmath2 , the particles are unable to rearrange themselves significantly and may get trapped in a glassy state , while for @xmath3 , the relaxation proceeds slowly and the situation resembles a classical sphere packing problem .",
    "it is this latter quasi - static limit of the relaxation process that we shall examine in this work .",
    "since the colloids are confined to a 2d surface , the arrested states tend to be quite crystalline as has been shown for spherical droplets or _ _ colloidosomes__@xcite .",
    "these structures should , therefore , exhibit properties similar to 2d elastic crystalline membranes@xcite .",
    "the presence of curvature frustrates the crystalline order and induces defects : particles which have more or fewer than six neighbors , and whose deviation from six - fold order can be quantified as a topological charge : particles with coordination number lower than six have positive charge and _ vice versa_. lone defects of positive or negative charge are known as _",
    "disclinations_. the topology of the droplet surface will determine the net defect charge , which is 12 for a spherical topology@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a coupling of defects to the gaussian curvature @xmath4 .",
    "because droplets with non - spherical geometries possess a variation in gaussian curvature along their surface , the defects should be non - uniformly distributed as theoretical studies have predicted@xcite .",
    "in addition to the minimal number of defects required by topology , pairs of positive and negative defects called dislocations can occur .",
    "droplets with a large system size , i.e. where the ratio @xmath5 of the droplet size @xmath6 to the particle size @xmath7 is large enough , exhibit chains of defects known as scars@xcite . for spherical droplets , a transition has been shown : @xmath5 is below a critical value only isolated defects occur . above this ratio",
    ", scars appear and increase in length with @xmath5@xcite .",
    "for surfaces of nonuniform curvature , the placement of the defects is an interesting question .",
    "the theory of curved elastic crystalline membranes@xcite predicts that defects and gaussian curvature act as source terms in a biharmonic equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a stress function and @xmath10 is the defect charge density ( a sum of point charges ) .",
    "the energy of such a system is , @xmath11 which must be minimized with respect to defect number and defect position , with total defect charge conserved according to the surface topology .",
    "while this suggests that defect charges will be attracted to areas of like - signed curvature in order to minimize the source term , the fact that these systems are governed by a biharmonic equation suggests that the coupling of defects to curvature is nontrivial .",
    "this is in contrast to simpler analogues , for example electrostatics , governed by a poisson equation .",
    "there are two important differences between an elastic crystalline membrane and a 2d arrested hard sphere system .",
    "first , in the hard sphere limit , the in - plane elastic constants of a hard sphere system are infinite .",
    "second , arrested hard sphere systems are not able to explore their full phase space , and so one does not expect to find them in the optimally packed ground state . for these reasons , it should not be expected that a 2d hard sphere system is exactly described by the theory of 2d crystalline membranes , but due to the highly crystalline order that is exhibited , the behavior should be qualitatively similar .",
    "additionally , the relative wetting properties of the two fluids may induce a contact angle , leading to inter - particle interactions that may modify the ordering@xcite .",
    "in other systems in the packing limit , e.g. viral capsids@xcite and small clusters of colloids@xcite , configurations with a high degree of symmetry are typically observed for certain special numbers of particles .",
    "experimentally , these tend to be stable , and so the identification of possible symmetric packings may serve as a guide towards stable self - assembled micro - structures .",
    "we therefore examine the packings systematically by aspect ratio @xmath12 and particle number @xmath13 to identify the symmetric configurations .    in order to explore the role of surface anisotropy on the ordering of packed particles , we present the results of simulations of hard spheres packed onto ellipsoidal surfaces using an inflation algorithm .",

    "the orange curve shows a high degree of nematic order directed along the polar direction in the mid - region , and the blue curve for the ends shows nematic order along the polar direction , as well as a peak between the directions of principal curvature , which is indicative of negative @xmath22 order .",

    "[ fig : orientation ] _ g _ and _ h_. scars at the equator exhibit a high degree of nematic order in the @xmath30 direction , which increases linearly with aspect ratio up to @xmath15 .",
    "this is unsurprising , because the curvature on highly oblate ellipsoids is localized to a nearly one - dimensional region around the equator of the ellipsoid , and so one expects the scars to form there , aligned along the equator .",

    "increasing @xmath13 above @xmath41 leads to a monotonic increase in average scar length .    from our simulation results of packings with @xmath42 , we calculated the average number of excess dislocations per topologically required disclination for each @xmath43 .",
    "defects were weighted in the analysis by the absolute value of their charge .",
    "given that there are two disclinations per dislocation , and 12 core disclinations , the number of excess dislocations per scar is calculated thus , @xmath44 where the sum is taken over all defects .",

    "the reason for this is that the high curvature at the end of the prolate ellipsoids accommodates @xmath85-fold defects at the poles , and these appear to determine the rotational symmetry for the entire configuration ; for oblates , the poles have low curvature and promote hexagonal packing , hence causing six - fold rotational symmetry to be more common .",
    "interestingly , other degrees are present including @xmath87 and @xmath88 and these configurations contain regions of highly oblique packings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : the - symmetry - landscape-1 ] _ d _ and _ e _ ) .    in general , these symmetric packings are notable because they contain a high degree of hexagonal ordering over much of their surface , with evenly spaced defects throughout .",
    "this high degree of regularity should provide stability to the packed structure , and reduce the likelihood of failure from irregularly spaced defects .",

    "ellipsoidal droplets with arrested interfaces are produced by preparing a pickering emulsion and then mixing the emulsion to deform and arrest the droplets in an elongated shape .",
    "details are given in _",
    "methods_.    fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] shows several examples of the arrested droplets observed . because the curvature of a droplet is significant across its surface ,",
    "several focal planes have been combined in the images in order to study the packing of spheres on the drop surface .",
    "particle coordinates are determined by finding the local brightness maxima in the image , recording their coordinates , and correcting for any unrealistic results via direct comparison with the experimental images .",
    "arrest is able to preserve shapes identical to intermediate states of droplets in an elongation field @xcite , as seen in the fig [ fig : experiment]_a _ and [ fig : experiment]_c _ , and even shapes resembling sections of such shapes as in the case of [ fig : experiment]_e_. while the dynamical formation of these shapes was not studied , it is clear that a wide range of geometries can be formed .",
    "we note that the droplet of aspect ratio 5.1 has a spherocylindrical geometry , as opposed to ellipsoidal .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] _ b _ , _ d _ , and _",
    "f _ shows the results of a delaunay triangulation of the sphere coordinates .",
    "we do not display particles at the boundary of the triangulation , as they include spurious edge defects identified as a result of the boundary rather than the ordering of the particles . in each case",
    "the arrested state of the interfacially adsorbed spheres is evident from the visible regions of crystalline order .",
    "generally , however , the experimental droplets contain more defects than the simulated packings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment]_b _ a high degree of hexagonal close - packing is noted near the ends of the droplet , while the center of the structure is more disordered with a higher defect density .",
    "three important factors present in the experiment that are not accounted for in the simulation may contribute to this .",
    "first , the evolution of the surface as it relaxes will influence particle rearrangement .",
    "different parts of the surface will grow or shrink at varying rates , affecting where crowding first occurs .",
    "second , particles adsorbed at an interface will not act as purely hard spheres .",
    "capillary interactions caused by the deformation of the surface by the particles will lead to attractive interactions between particles@xcite .",
    "this may lead to aggregation of particles during relaxation and is likely to influence the final ordering of the arrested state . finally ,",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the experimental relaxation does not take place quasistatically , as is posited by studying the packing limit ; it is highly likely that the particles are arrested in a nonoptimal and possibly metastable glassy state .",
    "a study of the role of these dynamical influences on the order is in preparation .",
    "in this paper , we show that defects in the packing of hard spheres onto an ellipsoidal surface couple nontrivially to the curvature . for low aspect ratios ,",
    "the defects occur at regions of high curvature as predicted by previous studies ; additional secondary peaks in the defect distribution occur in less - curved regions for prolate ellipsoids of sufficiently high aspect ratio .",
    "as previously observed for packings on a spherical surface , above a critical particle number the defects take the form of chains or scars rather than isolated defects .",
    "this scar transition occurs at a lower particle number than the previously studied case for soft interparticle interactions , and is softened by the presence of anisotropic curvature .",
    "the alignment of the scars with the curvature is more complicated : in flat regions , there is no alignment ; in intermediate regions , there is weak uniaxial alignment with the minimum curvature ; in regions of strong curvature , quadrupolar alignment is seen .",
    "we identified a rich catalog of symmetric configurations from our simulations , each belonging to a subgroup of the ellipsoidal symmetry group . plotting the subgroup order in @xmath82 space reveals commensurate surfaces that promote symmetric packings .",
    "finally , we were able to use the mechanism of arrest to sculpt ellipsoidal pickering emulsion droplets of varying aspect ratio , demonstrating the validity of the fundamental idea .",
    "while careful analysis of these experimental packings reveals scars as predicted , the defects appear to agglomerate in regions other than those of strongest curvature , suggesting that dynamical effects play a significant role in the ordering as well as the geometric effects studied here .",

    "bounds are imposed such that @xmath124 .",
    "adjusting @xmath113 leads to improved performance of the algorithm as the particles can diffuse more when they are less densely packed and take smaller steps ( which are more likely to be accepted ) when they are more densely packed .",
