    "then there exists a convex cap @xmath1 with the upper boundary isometric to @xmath0 . besides , @xmath2 is unique up to a rigid motion .",
    "informally speaking , a _",
    "convex cap _ is a convex polytope that lies on a plane and does not throw a shadow when the sun is in the zenith .",
    "the upper boundary @xmath0 of a convex cap is topologically a disk .",
    "the metric on @xmath0 is locally euclidean except at the vertices .",
    "indeed , a point on an edge has a small neighborhood isometric to a euclidean disk , the two halves of the disk lying on the two faces adjacent to the edge .",
    "similarly , neigborhoods of the interior vertices are isometric to euclidean cones with angles less than @xmath3 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath0 is locally modelled on the half - plane and angular regions with angles less than @xmath4 .",
    "any metric that has these properties is called a _",
    "convex euclidean polyhedral metric_. thus the upper boundary of any convex cap is a disk with a convex euclidean polyhedral metric .",
    "theorem [ thm : alex ] is the converse : any metric of this kind can be realized as the upper boundary of a convex cap , and this is in an essentially unique way .      in section [ sec : prelim ]",
    ", we give formal definitions and make some preliminary remarks .",
    "our proof uses the _",
    "variational method_. in this method the object whose existence is to be proved is identified with a critical point of a functional .",
    "if the functional achieves its maximum in the interior of the domain , then the maximum point is a critical point and yields a desired object .",
    "if , moreover , the functional is concave and the domain convex , then there is only one critical point .",
    "this implies the uniqueness of the object .",
    "the domain of our functional is the space @xmath5 of _ generalized convex caps _ with the upper boundary @xmath0 ; it is studied in section [ sec : gcc ] .",
    "the functional on @xmath5 is the _ total scalar curvature _",
    "@xmath6 which is studied in section [ sec : s ] .",
    "section [ sec : proof ] contains the details of the proof .",
    "subsection [ subsec : gccdef ] introduces generalized convex caps . roughly speaking",
    ", a generalized convex cap is a convex cap that has cone singularities along the heights .",
    "heights are the segments that join the vertices of the upper boundary with the base and are orthogonal to the base .",
    "if the curvatures around heights vanish , then the generalized convex cap becomes a usual convex cap . to define a generalized cap",
    ", one needs to specify a triangulation @xmath7 of @xmath0 and a collection @xmath8 of heights .",
    "however , in subsection [ subsec : heightstocaps ] we show that the heights already suffice .",
    "this makes the space @xmath5 naturally a subset of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the singular set of @xmath0 . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : spaceofcaps ] we show that @xmath5 is in fact a convex polytope in @xmath9 .    in subsection [ subsec : tsc ] we define the total scalar curvature of a generalized convex cap .",
    "it is similar to the definition @xmath11 of the total mean curvature of a convex polytope , where @xmath12 is the length of the edge @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the angle at @xmath13 . for generalized caps one takes additionally the sum of the heights multiplied with their curvatures . in subsection [ subsec : sconc ]",
    "we prove that the function @xmath6 is concave and in important cases strictly concave .",
    "this allows us to prove two rigidity theorems [ thm : genrig ] and [ thm : infrigcap ] for generalized and classical convex caps in the next subsection .",
    "also , due to the darboux - sauer theorem this yields a new proof of the infinitesimal rigidity of convex polytopes .    the most part of subsection [ subsec : proof ] deals with the case when @xmath6 achieves its maximum on the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "this happens when some faces of the resulting convex cap are vertical . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : volkov ] we sketch the proof of theorem [ thm : alex ] by volkov from @xcite .",
    "the variational method was extensively used in the study of circle packings and patterns , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the functionals that appear there can often be interpreted as volumes of certain hyperbolic polyhedra .",
    "our primary goal was to find a variational proof of alexandrov s theorem on the existence and uniqueness of a polytope with the given metric on the boundary , see subsection [ subsec : alvol ] .",
    "a similar approach , via generalized convex polytopes and the total scalar curvature meets with an obstacle there : the functional is neither concave nor convex . in return , a rather unexpected relation arises between the total scalar curvature and the volume of the dual .",
    "this allows one to prove the non - degeneracy of the hessian of the total scalar curvature by extending the alexandrov - fenchel inequalities for mixed volumes .",
    "this variation on the variational method leads to a proof presented in @xcite .",
    "alexandrov s theorems are , in fact , special cases of a very general statement about realization of a euclidean , spherical , or hyperbolic metric with cone singularities of positive or negative curvature on a surface of an arbitrary genus .",
    "each time , such a metric can be realized in a unique way as the boundary of a certain polyhedral object .",
    "the case of a sphere with the singularities of positive curvature is alexandrov s theorem on euclidean , hyperbolic and spherical polytopes .",
    "spherical metrics on the sphere with singularities of negative curvature were considered in @xcite .",
    "for the formulation of the general statement and the proof of the case of genus greater than one , see @xcite .",
    "the case of metrics on the torus is the subject of the paper @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm : alex ] looks similar to another , more renowned theorem of alexandrov : _ let @xmath6 be a sphere with a convex euclidean polyhedral metric ; then there exists a unique convex polytope @xmath15 with the boundary isometric to @xmath6 . _ in his book , alexandrov derives the cap theorem from the polytope theorem . indeed , by identifying two copies of @xmath0 along the boundary one gets a convex polyhedral metric on the sphere . because of the uniqueness , the polytope that realizes this metric must have a plane of symmetry .",
    "thus it can be cut in two convex caps .",
    "this proves the existence of a cap with the upper boundary @xmath0 .",
    "the uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of the polytope with the boundary the doubled @xmath0 .    to prove his polytope theorem , alexandrov used a method called sometimes the _ deformation method _ or the invariance of domain method .",
    "consider the space @xmath16 of all convex polytopes and the space @xmath17 of all convex polyhedral metrics on the sphere .",
    "there is an obvious map @xmath18 that associates to a polytope the metric of its boundary .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of a polytope with a given metric is translated as the bijectivity of this map .",
    "alexandrov shows that the map is a local homeomorphism , which is related to the infinitesimal rigidity .",
    "then he proves certain topological properties of the spaces and of the map which imply that the map is in fact a bijection .",
    "alexandrov applied the deformation method to several existence and uniqueness statements for polyhedral objects , see @xcite .",
    "recently it was used in @xcite , @xcite to prove parts of the general statement mentioned at the end of subsection [ subsec : relwork ] .",
    "a drawback of this method is that it is not constructive : it provides no algorithm how to construct the polytope with a given development .",
    "alexandrov points this out in @xcite after he proves by deformation minkowski s theorem on the existence and uniqueness of a convex polytope with given face normals and face areas .",
    "alexandrov notes that minkowski s own proof is by the variational method , and poses the problem to find a similar proof for his polytope theorem .",
    "a. volkov , a student of alexandrov , found constructive proofs both for the polytope and for the cap theorem .",
    "he considered generalized convex caps with positive curvatures around the heights and showed that the curvatures vanish when the sum of heights is maximized .",
    "this proof is published in @xcite , for english translation see ( * ? ? ? * section 12.2 ) .",
    "volkov s proof of the polytope theorem is similar and is the subject of volkov s phd of 1955 , see also @xcite .",
    "volkov s approach is not variational in the above sense .",
    "the functional is linear , so the maximum point always lies on the boundary of the domain and is not a critical point of the functional .",
    "but his proof is elementary and , in the case of the cap , quite short .",
    "our proof is to a large extent inspired by the works of volkov . in @xcite ,",
    "reprinted as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12.1 ) volkov studies the local behavior of the function @xmath6 and proves claims that are very close to the concavity of @xmath6 .",
    "completely new in our paper are the explicit description of the space @xmath5 as a compact convex subset of a euclidean space and the global rigidity statement for generalized convex caps .",
    "i am indebted to alexander i. bobenko for bringing the problem to my attention and for helpful discussions .",
    "i thank franois fillastre and jean - marc schlenker for useful remarks .",
    "here we give the formal definitions of what was sketched in the introduction and reduce theorem [ thm : alex ] to the case when the polyhedral disk @xmath0 has at least one interior and at least one boundary singularity .",
