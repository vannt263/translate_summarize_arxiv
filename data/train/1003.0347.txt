    "the existence of a global solar dynamo is generally accepted , though it is not well understood .",
    "there is evidence for a second , local dynamo operating near the solar surface  the so - called solar - surface dynamo @xcite .",
    "this dynamo may be driven by turbulence : magnetic energy is amplified by random stretching of magnetic field lines by turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "magnetic energy is lost to ohmic dissipation . for dynamo action to succeed , stretching must dominate over dissipation .",
    "the relative strengths of these two effects is quantified by the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are typical velocity and length scales and @xmath9 the magnetic diffusivity ) .",
    "similarly , the kinetic reynolds number is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "when @xmath12 exceeds a critical threshold , @xmath13 , dynamo action results .",
    "two different types of dynamo can be found , depending on the presence or absence of net flow helicity @xcite . with net helicity",
    ", magnetic energy grows at scales larger than the energy - containing scale of the fluid motions : large - scale dynamo ( lsd ) or mean - field dynamo .",
    "lsds are often studied with mean - field theory ; the production of large - scale magnetic energy is approximately the alpha - effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . without net helicity ,",
    "dynamo action is harder to achieve and magnetic every grows at scales smaller than the forcing scale .",
    "this latter defines small - scale dynamo ( ssd ) or fluctuation dynamo action . near the solar surface ,",
    "the convective time scale is much shorter than the rotation period , the effects of rotation can be neglected , and a flow with no net helicity results .",
    "any surface dynamo will thus be a ssd .",
    "this is also suggested by observation of the small - scale magnetic field in the quiet sun . in high resolution magnetograms",
    "we see mixed polarity fields on small scales , which is variously called the magnetic carpet or the salt - and - pepper pattern @xcite , consistent with the idea of ssd action . as turbulent convection",
    "can drive small - scale dynamo action ( in numerical simulations of boussinesq convection without rotation @xcite ) , observations and simulations together provide evidence of a ssd driven by turbulence at the solar surface ( likely deeper as well ) .",
    "several arguments can be put forward against a small - scale solar dynamo .",
    "firstly , there exists the possibility that the small - scale field is solely produced by the shredding up of large - scale field by turbulence .",
    "however , observationally the amount of small - scale flux is not dependent on the solar cycle @xcite",
    ". this might not be the case if the small - scale flux is the result of the shredding up of the field from the global dynamo .",
    "it might also then show some latitudinal dependence ( among low latitudes ) . assuming the existence of both ssd and shredding , small - scale dynamo",
    "is predicted to create small - scale magnetic field at the turbulent rate of stretching ( @xmath14 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) which is much faster either than large - scale field can be produced ( at time scales associated with the kinetic - energy - containing length scales ) or be shredded up by the turbulence @xcite .",
    "secondly , small - scale dynamo action may not be possible at the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath15 , of the solar plasma , @xmath16 : @xmath17 sharply increases with decreasing @xmath15 ( increasing @xmath18 ) since eddies smaller than the characteristic scale of the magnetic field diffuse the field and inhibit dynamo action .",
    "the two asymptotic possibilities are @xmath19const as @xmath20 ( ssd at low @xmath15 ; @xcite ) or @xmath21const as @xmath20 ( no ssd at low @xmath15 ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations of low @xmath15 ssds have focused on the existence ( or not ) of a time - averaged mean flow .",
    "such a flow exists for the sun and many other astrophysical cases . both with @xcite and without a mean flow @xcite ,",
    "a plateau in @xmath17 was found .",
    "this suggests such dynamo action should be possible on the sun .",
    "however , the @xmath15 of the sun is 3 orders of magnitude smaller that that accessible to present numerical computations ; the observed plateaus may not represent the asymptotic behavior .",
    "fortunately , a laboratory dynamo resulting from unconstrained turbulence in liquid sodium ( @xmath22 ) has been demonstrated @xcite establishing that a turbulent dynamo is possible at values of @xmath15 corresponding to the solar plasma .",
    "the remaining objection against a surface dynamo was raised by @xcite : unlike the @xcite simulation , the sun is strongly stratified and magnetic flux is swept into the down - flow lanes and subject to long recirculation times . in the simulations of @xcite with open boundaries ,",
    "no dynamo action was found .",
    "however , @xcite have demonstrated ssd action for sufficiently high @xmath12 using the muram code @xcite .",
    "they simulated a box with strong stratification and open boundaries , but prevented advection of magnetic flux from outside the box : providing an artificially isolated surface layer ignoring any ssd action that may occur in deeper layers .",
    "they conducted 3 simulations with increasing @xmath12 ( see table [ table : compare ] ) . above the critical threshold , @xmath23",
    ", dynamo action occurs .",
    "the magnetic energy spectrum peaks at scales smaller than the energy - containing scale of the fluid motions , demonstrating that ssd _ is _ a possibility for a solar surface dynamo despite strong stratification and little recirculation . in table",
    "[ table : compare ] , dynamo action in the 3 muram simulations of @xcite as well as in the simulations of @xcite and of @xcite is indicated solely by their @xmath12 and @xmath15 . for the simulations below the critical threshold for dynamo action , ( @xmath24 ) , there is no dynamo action .",
    "the result by @xcite is an exception as @xmath25 and this lowers the threshold .",

    "for instance , @xcite find from _ hinode _ sp observations that the mean horizontal magnetic field is stronger than the mean unsigned vertical magnetic field .",
    "using a spatial map , in the `` normal mode '' ( @xmath39 ) , they make magnetograms of the apparent longitudinal flux density , @xmath40 , and apparent transverse flux density , @xmath41 .",
    "they find a factor of 5 stronger horizontal fields : the means are @xmath42 g and @xmath43 g .",
    "a similar ratio was found in the muram run c dynamo by @xcite ; see also @xcite . in the muram simulation , both small - scale , low - lying vertical loops and extended canopy - like structures are found in the line formation region .",
    "these structures ( related to flux expulsion of horizontal field ) contribute to the stronger mean horizontal fields : horizontal field occupies a larger area than the narrow vertical foot points .",
    "the simulation also makes a prediction : lines with different formation heights will yield different ratios .",
    "whatever its source , the small - scale quiet - sun magnetic field is turbulent .",
    "this should be taken into consideration when interpreting observations @xcite .",
    "consider the discrepancy between the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the apparent vertical flux densities from the _ hinode _ sp observation ( discussed in the previous section ) and that of @xmath44 in muram dynamo run c ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] ) . for the sp observation ,",
    "the pdf is peaked at @xmath45 g .",
    "the simulation pdf is monotonic ; there is a much greater amount of weak field than in observations . here",

    "the pdf ( dash - dotted line ) becomes quite similar to that of the _ hinode _ observation .",
    "the observation has a much greater amount of strong field due to the much higher @xmath12 of the sun ( more efficient ssd ) and the presence of network elements which are not in the simulation . in any case , these considerations show that the observed peaked pdf is in fact consistent with a much greater prevalence of weak vertical magnetic field .",

    "[ fig : ray](a ) , we plot the @xmath50components of the magnetic field and velocity for a simulation pixel with @xmath51 .",
    "the magnetic field undergoes a reversal above @xmath52 .",
    "the average of @xmath44 over the line formation region is very small ( @xmath53 g ) , but the reversal of @xmath44 is coincident with a strong gradient in @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the absorption profiles from the two opposite - polarity fields are doppler shifted with respect to each other and do not cancel .",
    "such cancellation leads to a stronger stokes @xmath0 signal than would otherwise arise ( also an asymmetric one , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ray](b ) ) .",
    "if this statistically accounts for the differences in the pdfs , a correspondence between the strength of the velocity fluctuations along the line of sight and the synthetic magnetogram would be expected ( for pixels with weak @xmath46 ) .",
    "this is indeed seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sami ] , which includes only pixels with @xmath55 g . there exists a definite trend of stronger magnetogram signal when there are stronger doppler shifts ( velocity gradients ) between the various layers of the atmosphere .",
