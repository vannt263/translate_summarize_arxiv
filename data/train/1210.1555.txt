    "more precisely , edmonds proved that every non - zero degree map between two closed surfaces is homotopic to the composition of a pinch map followed by a branched covering  @xcite .",
    "a pinch map in dimension two is a map which collapses 2-handles , i.e. is a quotient map @xmath14 , where a submanifold @xmath15 , with circle boundary in the interior of @xmath16 , is identified to a point . in dimension three ,",
    "edmonds result is that every @xmath17-surjective map of degree at least three is homotopic to a branched covering  @xcite .",

    "our aim in this paper is to show that every simply connected , closed four - manifold , resp .",
    "five - manifold , admits a branched double covering by a product @xmath18 , composed with a certain pinch map , resp . a map whose degree depends on the torsion of the integral homology of the target .",

    "we note that the statement of theorem [ t : main ] does not contain any reference on orientations , because the targets are simply connected and therefore always orientable .",
    "the existence of dominant maps , not necessarily branched coverings , where the domain is a non - trivial product has an independent interest and its study is partially motivated by gromov s work on functorial semi - norms on homology  @xcite .",

    "we have now obtained a branched double covering @xmath58 proving the claim for @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath60 we iterate the above construction .",
    "the statement of theorem [ t : main ] is the most general possible concerning oriented @xmath23-bundles over @xmath24 , but it moreover presupposes the structure group of these bundles to be linear .",
    "this assumption is not necessary in dimensions four and five ( cf .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite respectively ) and so we will be able to construct many branched coverings in those two dimensions ; cf .",
    "sections [ s:4-mfds ] and [ s:5-mfds ] .",
    "the inspiration for the construction of the branched covering of theorem [ t : main ] stems from a previous joint work with kotschick on domination for three - manifolds by circle bundles  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we proved there that for every @xmath20 there is a @xmath17-surjective branched double covering @xmath61 .",
    "a direct generalization of that construction is achieved if we replace @xmath50 in @xmath62 by any oriented , closed @xmath2-dimensional manifold @xmath29 .",
    "the steps of the proof follow those of  @xcite and they are left to the reader :    [ t : general ] let @xmath29 be a connected , oriented , closed @xmath2-dimensional manifold . for every @xmath20",
    "there is a @xmath17-surjective branched double covering @xmath63 .",
    "the constructions given in theorems [ t : main ] and [ t : general ] are of different nature , because the connected summands of the target in theorem [ t : main ] are twisted products , while in theorem [ t : general ] the summands are direct products .",
    "for this reason the proof of theorem [ t : main ] can not be deduced using theorem [ t : general ] .",
    "( nevertheless , theorem [ t : general ] could be seen as a special case of theorem [ t : main ] for @xmath64 . ) a further generalization of theorem [ t : main ] would be to consider targets that are connected sums of fiber bundles over @xmath24 , where the fiber is an arbitrary oriented , closed manifold @xmath29",
    ". however , the comprehension of arbitrary twisted products @xmath65 ( and of connected sums built out of such summands ) seems , in general , not sufficiently enough to produce further generalization of theorem [ t : main ] .",

    "we refer to chapter 3 of  @xcite for further details .",

    "first , we show that every four - manifold diffeomorphic to a connected sum @xmath73 admits a branched double covering by a product @xmath74 .",
    "we then deduce by the classification results of wall  @xcite and freedman  @xcite , that every simply connected , closed four - manifold admits a branched double covering by a product of the circle with a connected sum of copies of @xmath0 , followed by a collapsing map .    by a result of smale  @xcite ,",
    "the inclusion @xmath75 is a homotopy equivalence and so there exist only two oriented @xmath24-bundles over @xmath24 .",

    "clearly , the rank @xmath20 of @xmath186 is equal to the number of @xmath232 and @xmath137 , i.e. the number of @xmath26-bundles over @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we may assume that the torsion of @xmath186 is not trivial , otherwise we appeal to proposition [ p : torsionfree ] to deduce that @xmath29 admits a branched double covering by a product @xmath233 .    by corollary",
    "[ c : ru ] ( and the comments following that ) we deduce that the part of @xmath230 not containing @xmath234 or @xmath137 admits a dominant map by @xmath175 whose degree is a power of the least common multiple of the torsion second integral homology groups @xmath235 and @xmath212 , @xmath236 . now lemma [ l : consum ] implies that @xmath29 is dominated by a manifold diffeomorphic to @xmath237 ( if @xmath238 , we additionally use the fact that @xmath232 is a branched double covering of @xmath137 , as we have seen above in this section ) .",
    "the degree of @xmath229 is clearly determined ( up to multiplication by two ) by the torsion of @xmath186 .",
    "finally , theorem [ t : general ] implies that @xmath237 admits a branched double covering by @xmath113 , completing the proof of theorem [ t:5-mfds ] .    by remark [ r : generalpillow ]",
    ", we also have that @xmath237 admits branched double coverings by @xmath239 and @xmath240 , and branched four - fold coverings by @xmath241 and @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is an oriented , closed surface of genus @xmath20 .",
    "[ r : mappingdegrees5-mfds ] in contrast to theorem [ t:4-mfds ] , the statement of theorem [ t:5-mfds ] does not provide absolute control of the degree of the map @xmath244 following the branched double covering @xmath228 .",
    "this is related to the problem of determining the sets of ( self-)mapping degrees of simply connected five - manifolds , which is essentially still unsolved .",
    "however , an aside result of this paper is that the sets of degrees of maps between the summands @xmath134 and @xmath150 ( for @xmath245 ) are infinite , because every multiple of a power of the torsion second homology of @xmath150 ( resp .",
    "@xmath134 ) can be realized as a degree for a map @xmath246 ( resp .",
    "@xmath247 ) ; recall that @xmath175 admits self - maps of any degree and it is minimal for the domination relation .",
    "in particular , we deduce , without using formality ( see  @xcite ) , that the set of self - mapping degrees for every simply connected five - manifold is infinite .",
    "by the above results of wall  @xcite and smale  @xcite , every 2-connected , closed six - manifold @xmath29 is diffeomorphic to @xmath254 , for some non - negative integer @xmath255 .",
    "the proof now follows by the generalized pillowcase map in remark [ r : generalpillow ] .",
    "we note that @xmath29 admits a degree two map by @xmath260 as well . for take",
    "the branched double covering @xmath261 of corollary [ c:6-manifolds ] and precompose it with a degree one map @xmath262 , using lemma [ l : consum ] and the fact that every sphere is minimal admitting maps of any degree .      every dominant map onto a simply connected four - manifold @xmath263 is a priori @xmath17-surjective because the target has trivial fundamental group . however , the branched double covering @xmath264 obtained in theorem [ t : general ] ( for @xmath265 ) is @xmath17-surjective also by construction . in a previous joint work with kotschick",
    "@xcite we have shown that there is a branched double covering @xmath266 which is again @xmath17-surjective ( now the target @xmath267 is not simply connected ) .",
    "we multiply ( [ eq.2 ] ) with the identity map on @xmath50 to obtain a @xmath17-surjective branched double covering @xmath268    now we compose ( [ eq.3 ] ) with ( [ eq.1 ] ) to obtain a dominant map @xmath269 . this map is not a branched covering , not even in the case where @xmath114 is diffeomorphic to @xmath102 , because the branch locus of ( [ eq.3 ] ) intersects the preimage of the branch locus of ( [ eq.1 ] ) in a codimension four subset of @xmath93 .",
    "nevertheless , we note that @xmath270 is a branched four - fold cover of @xmath271 , by remark [ r : generalpillow ] . the existence of dominant maps from products @xmath270 to every simply connected",
    "four - manifold has also been shown by kotschick and lh  @xcite , using a result of duan and wang  @xcite .",
    "that result states that if @xmath191 and @xmath272 are oriented , closed four - manifolds and @xmath272 is simply connected , then a degree @xmath273 map @xmath5 exists if and only if the intersection form of @xmath272 , multiplied by @xmath4 , is embedded into the intersection form of @xmath191 , where the embedding is given by @xmath274 ( the `` only if '' part is obvious ) .",
    "as we mention in section [ s:4-mfds ] , the above existence criterion by duan and wang implies that every integer can be realized as the degree of a map from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , although no such map can be deformed to a branched covering by a recent result of pankka and souto  @xcite .",
    "however , according to theorem [ t:4-mfds ] , it is natural to ask when a @xmath17-surjective non - zero degree map between two connected , oriented , closed four - manifolds is homotopic to the composition of a branched covering with a pinch map .",
    "another natural question in this context is the following ( suggested to me by j. souto ) : let @xmath114 be a connected , oriented , closed four - manifold and @xmath275 a @xmath17-surjective map of non - zero degree .",
    "is there a @xmath276 so that the composition of the pinch map @xmath277 with @xmath7 is homotopic to a branched covering ?",
    "kotschick and lh  @xcite asked whether every closed manifold with finite fundamental group is dominated by a product . in this paper , we have answered in positive that question in dimensions four and five and in certain higher dimensions . for all our dominant maps onto a simply connected @xmath2-dimensional manifold ,",
    "the domain can be taken to be a product of the circle with a connected sum of copies of @xmath278 . according to this",
    ", one could ask whether every closed manifold with finite fundamental group is dominated by a product of type @xmath18 , where @xmath114 is an @xmath118-dimensional manifold ( e.g. @xmath279 for some @xmath276 ) , or more generally , by a product of type @xmath280 . this is a considerably stronger question than that of  @xcite",
    ", however , it seems less likely to be true .",
    "for instance , simply connected manifolds which admit self - maps of absolute degree at most one might not be dominated by products ( at least ) of type @xmath280 .",
    "such manifolds exist and are called inflexible ; see for example  @xcite . in this direction , and since the set of self - mapping degrees of @xmath280 is infinite , we ask the following ( at least in the simply connected case ) : are there examples of inflexible manifolds that are dominated by flexible ones ( i.e. by manifolds whose sets of self - mapping degrees are infinite ) ?",
