    "such _ ab initio _ dmft based self ",
    "consistent electronic structure algorithms should be able to explore all space of parameters where neither dopings nor even degeneracy itself is kept fixed as different states may appear close to the fermi level during iterations towards self  consistency .",
    "this is crucial if one would like to calculate properties of realistic solid state system where bandwidth and the strength of the interaction is not known at the beginning .",
    "it is very different from the ideology of model hamiltonians where the input set of parameters defines the regime of correlations , and the corresponding many ",
    "body techniques may be applied afterwards .",
    "realistic dmft  simulations of material properties require fast scans of the entire parameter space to determine the interaction for a given doping , degeneracy and bandwidth via the solution of the general multiorbital anderson impurity model ( aim ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , present approaches based on either non  crossing approximation ( nca )  or iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) are unable to provide the solution to that problem due to a limited number of regimes where these methods can be applied @xcite .",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique dmft , jarrell is very accurate and can cope with multiorbital situation but not with multiplet interactions .",
    "also its applicability so far has been limited either to a small number of orbitals or to unphysically large temperatures due to its computational cost .",
    "recently some progress has been achieved using impurity solvers that improve upon the nca approximation rotors , jeschke , haule:2001 , but it has not been possible to retrieve fermi liquid behavior at very low temperatures with these methods in the orbitally degenerate case .    as universal impurity solvers have not yet being designed in the past we need to explore other possibilities , and this paper proposes interpolative approach for the self  energy in general multiorbital situation .",
    "we stress that this is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem , but follow  up of the ideology of lda theory where approximations were designed by analytical fits @xcite to the quantum monte carlo simulations for homogeneous electron gas @xcite .",
    "numerically very expensive qmc calculations for the impurity model display smooth self ",
    "energies at imaginary frequencies for a wide range of interactions and dopings , and it is therefore tempting to design such an interpolation . we also keep in mind that for many applications a high precision in reproducing the self  energies may not be required .",
    "one of such applications is , for example , the calculation of the total energy ce , nature , science , nioprl which , as well known from lda based experience , may not be so sensitive to the details of the one  electron spectra . as a result , we expect that even crude evaluations of the self ",
    "energy shapes on imaginary axis may be sufficient for solving many realistic total energy problems , some of which have appeared already @xcite .",
    "another point is a computational efficiency and numerical stability . bringing full self  consistent loops with respect to charge densities nature and",
    "other spectral functions require many iterations towards the convergency which may not need too accurate frequency resolutions at every step .",
    "however , the procedure which solves the impurity model should smoothly connect various regions of the parameter space .",
    "this is a crucial point if one would like to have a numerically stable algorithm and our new interpolational approach ideally solves this problem .    in the calculations of properties such as the low  energy spectroscopy and",
    "especially transport more delicate distribution of spectral weight is taken place at low energies , and the imaginary part of the analytically continued self  energy needs to be computed with a greater precision .",
    "here we expect that our obtained spectral functions should be used with care .",
    "also , in a few well distinct regimes , such , e.g. , as very near the mott transition , the behavior maybe much more complicated and more difficult to interpolate .",
    "for the cases mentioned above  extensions of the interpolative methods should be implemented and its beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we can achieve a fast interpolative algorithm for the self ",
    "energy by utilizing a rational representation .",
    "the coefficients in this interpolation can be found by forcing the self  energy to obey several limits and constrains .",
    "for example , if infinite frequency ( hartree  fock ) limit , positions of the hubbard bands , low  frequency mass renormalization @xmath4 , mean number of particles @xmath5 as well as the value of the self  energy at zero frequency @xmath6 are known from independent calculation , the set of interpolating coefficients is well defined . in this work ,",
    "we explore the slave  boson mean  field ( sbmf ) approach @xcite and the hubbard i approximation @xcite to determine the functional dependence of these coefficients upon doping , degeneracy and the strength of the interaction @xmath7 .",
    "we verify all trends produced by this interpolative procedure in the regimes of weak , intermediate and strong interactions and at various dopings conditions .",
    "these trends are compared with known analytical limits as well as against calculations using the quantum monte carlo method .",
    "also , compared with qmc are self  energies and spectral functions on both imaginary and real axes for selective values of dopings .",
    "they indicate that the sbmf approach can predict such parameters of interpolation as @xmath8and @xmath4 with a good accuracy while the hubbard i method fails in a number of regimes .",
    "however , the functional form of the atomic green function which appears within hubbard i can be used to determine positions of atomic satellites which helps to impose additional constraints on our procedure .    giving an extraordinary computational speed of this approach we generally find a very satisfactory accuracy in comparisons with the numerically more accurate qmc calculations .",
    "if an increased accuracy is desired our method can be naturally extended by imposing more constraints and by implementing more refined impurity solvers other than the ones explored in this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss rational interpolation for the self  energy and list the constraints . in section iii",
    "we discuss methods for solving anderson impurity model such as the slave  boson mean field and the hubbard i approximations which can be used to find these constraints .",
    "a brief survey of the qmc method used to benchmark our algorithm is also given .",
    "we present numerical comparisons of sbmf and hubbard i techniques against the qmc simulations for such quantities as quasiparticle residue and multiple occupancies . in section",
    "iv we report the results of the interpolative method and compare the obtained spectral functions with the qmc .",
    "in section v we discuss possible improvements of the algorithm .",
    "section vi is the conclusion .",

    "can be also viewed as a continuous fraction expansion but continuous fraction representation will not be necessary for the description of the method .",
    "our basic assumption is that only a well distinct set of poles in the rational representation ( [ rat ] ) is necessary to reproduce an overall frequency dependence of the self  energy .",
    "extensive experience gained from solving hubbard and periodic anderson model within dmft at various ratios of the on  site coulomb interaction @xmath7 to the bandwidth @xmath20 shows the appearance of lower and upper hubbard bands as well as renormalized quasiparticle peak in the spectrum of one  electron excitations @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the hubbard bands are damped atomic excitations and to the lowest order approximation appear as the positions of the poles of the atomic green function . in the @xmath21 symmetry case which is described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",

    "the centers of the hubbard bands are thus located at the atomic excitations @xmath32 . using standard expression for the atomic green function",
    "@xmath33 $ ] , we arrive to a desired representation for the atomic self  energy    @xmath34}{\\prod\\limits_{n=1}^{n-1}[\\omega -z_{n}^{(g ) } ] } .",

    "we now concentrate on the description of the quasiparticle peak which is present in metallic state of the system . for this",
    "an extra pole and zero have to be added in eq ( [ sat ] ) . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the hubbard model for the @xmath21 case where the local green function can be written by the following hilbert transform @xmath36.$ ] if self  energy lifetime effects are ignored , the local spectral function becomes @xmath37 $ ] where @xmath38 is the non  interacting density of states .",

    "therefore in realistic situations when only the upper and lower hubbard bands have significant spectral weight along with the quasiparticle peak , the actual degree of the polynomial expansion is either two or three .",
    "however , it is advantageous numerically and cheap computationally to keep all poles and zeroes in eq .",
    "( [ szp ] ) because the formula automatically distributes spectral weight over all existing hubbard bands .    in the limit when @xmath80 the self ",

    "the conditions _ b ) _ and _ c ) _ drop out while all poles @xmath28 and zeroes @xmath30 can be used to determine the interpolation .",
    "however , in this regime it does not matter whether one of @xmath30 closest to @xmath66 is dropped out or kept , since we can always replace this information by information about @xmath81 therefore the mott transition can be studied without changing the constraints .",
    "we thus see that in the insulating case the self  energy correctly reproduces the well  known result of the hubbard i  method where the green function is computed after eq .",

    "this effect is evident from the simulations using various perturbative or qmc impurity solvers and can be naturally incorporated into the interpolative formulas ( [ rat ] ) or ( [ szp ] ) .",
    "however , in practical implementation below we will omit it for illustrative purposes .",

    "the latter can be viewed moments as expansion in terms of the moments @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",

    "we will show how this can be implemented using the sbmf multiple occupancies which will be found to be in better agreement with the quantum monte carlo data .",
    "note that the moments @xmath82 themselves can be used in establishing the constraints for interpolation coefficients .",
    "this would involve independent evaluations of @xmath88 , etc . as well as various integrals involving hybridization function @xmath35 .",

    "we thus see that the interpolational scheme is defined completely once a prescription for obtaining parameters such as @xmath90 @xmath91 as well as poles @xmath28 , and zeroes @xmath30 is given . for this purpose",
    "we will test two commonly used methods : sbmf method due to gutzwiller @xcite as described by kotliar and ruckenstein ruck and the well  known hubbard i approximation @xcite .",
    "we compare these results against more accurate but computationally demanding quantum monte carlo calculations and establish the procedure to extract all necessary parameters .",
    "note that once the constraints such as @xmath4 are computed from a given approximate method , some of the quantities such as the total number of particles , @xmath84 , and the value of the self  energy at zero frequency , @xmath92 can be computed fully self  consistently .",
    "they can be compared with their non  self  consistent values .",
    "if the approximate scheme already provides a good approximation for @xmath84 and satisfies the friedel sum rule , the self  consistency can be avoided hence accelerating the calculation .",
    "indeed we found that inclusion of the self ",
    "consistency improves the results only marginally except when we are in a close vicinity to the mott transition but here we do not expect that our simple interpolative algorithm is very accurate .",
    "we now give the description of the approximate methods for solving the impurity model and then present the comparisons of our interpolative procedure with the qmc calculations .",

    "extensive description of this method can be found in ref . .",
    "we will use this method to benchmark our calculations using approximate algorithms described later in this section .      a fast approach",

    "the inaccuracy in @xmath224 is small in many regions of parameters and typically amounts to 510 per cent .",

    ", our analysis shows that in many cases the discrepancy in @xmath224 is connected with the overestimation of @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , points ii ) and iii ) mentioned above are interrelated .",
    "the requirement that @xmath227 can be enforced by adjusting the width of the quasiparticle band , and in many regions of parameters this is controlled by @xmath228 however , there are situations when the hubbard band appears in the vicinity of @xmath66 , and changing @xmath223 does not affect the bandwidth@xmath127 to gain a control in those cases it is better to replace the constraints @xmath229 by constraints of fixing the self  energies at two frequencies@xmath144 say @xmath230 and @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the frequency of the order of renormalized bandwidth@xmath127 we have found that this scheme brings mass renormalizations which are about 30% smaller than the sbmf ones , and the agreement with the qmc is significantly improved .",

    "however , we also would like to point out that the condition @xmath227 is essentially non  linear as the solution may not exist for all regions of parameters .",
    "it is , for example , evident that in such points where @xmath224 is given by a symmetry ( as , e.g. , particle  hole symmetry point @xmath233 in the case considered above ) the mass renormalization does not affect the number of electrons .",
    "as the philosophy of our approach is to get the best possible fit we are also open to implementing any kinds of _ ad hoc _ renormalizations constants .",
    "one of such possibility could be the use of a quasiparticle residue 30 per cent smaller than @xmath234 as @xmath223 should go to unity when @xmath235 , the correction can , for example , be encoded into the formula @xmath236.$ ]    we finally would like to remark that the scheme defined by a set of linear equations for the coefficients ( [ co1])([co6 ] ) is absolutely robust as solutions exist for all regimes of parameters such as strength of the interaction , doping and degeneracy . in general , bringing any information on the self energy @xmath237 at some frequency point @xmath238 or its derivative @xmath239 would generate a linear relationship between the interpolation coefficients , thus keeping robustness of the method . on the other hand , fixing such relationships as numbers of electrons brings non  linearity to the problem which could lead to multiplicity or non  existence of the solutions .",
