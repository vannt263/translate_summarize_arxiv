    "the neutralization of charged black holes can be identified with the separation between the inside and the outside of the wormhole  like structure .",

    "the rn metric has wormholes called rn wormholes @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , they are not observable in dynamically formed charged black holes within the static limit because of the mass inflation effect .",
    "the wormhole  like structure appears again as we consider hawking radiation .",
    "evaporating charged black holes with relatively small @xmath82 have both @xmath42 and @xmath41 types of inner horizons , and any physical observers crossing both of them will observe the increase of locally measured area .",
    "the inner horizon corresponds to the throat of the wormhole  like structure , as described in figure [ fig : diagram_new ] .    in equation ( [ gandt ] ) , @xmath128 component of the einstein tensor gives @xmath129 where @xmath130 . to obtain a wormhole  like structure , @xmath131 around the @xmath132 type horizon is necessary .",
    "it requires @xmath133 in this region , violation of the null energy condition .",
    "since we assumed hawking radiation , such violation is naturally obtained .",
    "in contrast to many models of wormholes that involve exotic matters or exotic initial conditions , the wormhole  like structure in evaporating charged black holes can be an interesting and natural model to obtain such a structure in a dynamic process @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . however , it is not clear whether a charged black hole is indeed a wormhole or not .",
    "while a wormhole connects two asymptotically flat regions , the existence of such a region inside of a charged black hole can not be determined by semiclassical analysis because of the cauchy horizon . even if a charged black hole is a wormhole , it is one  way traversable and its deep inside has large curvature which can be trans ",
    "planckian depending on @xmath30 . nevertheless , the region around the throat is still reliable in a background of realizable @xmath30 .    as a charged black hole",
    "is neutralized , its inner horizon evolves to a singularity . during this process",
    ", the inside and the outside of the wormhole  like structure are separated and the throat becomes a singularity .",
    "it induces a cauchy horizon , beyond which can not be determined in terms of the semiclassical physics .",
    "nevertheless , suppose that the inside region is regular and that there is no time  like singularity , as described in figure [ fig : wormhole ] ( a ) . in this case , this process can cause issues related to the information loss problem because the disconnected region can have an asymptotically flat region @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , in other cases such as figure [ fig : wormhole ] ( b ) , the semiclassical analysis does not provide any meaningful remarks .",
    "we studied the internal structure of charged black holes for important stages in its time evolution using numerical simulations .",
    "we adopted a spherically symmetric charged black hole model that includes the renormalized energy  momentum tensor to consider hawking radiation . solving the equations for various initial conditions",
    ", we obtained general behavior of charged black holes .    when charged black holes are formed by collapses of charged matter shells , various internal structures",
    "are observed depending on their mass and charge . for black holes with relatively small charge",
    " mass ratio , both trapping and anti  trapping inner horizons are observed .",
    "the internal structure of such black holes is similar to a wormhole .",
    "as we consider black holes with more charge , the inner horizons gradually move out of sight , and they are not observed in nearly extreme black holes . since hawking temperature is close to zero in nearly extreme black holes , it is natural that their structure becomes analogous to the static limit .",
    "as time passes , the mass and charge of the black hole will evolve via hawking radiation and discharge .",
    "although the mass and charge determined the internal structure in the stage of formation , we found that the internal structure becomes insensitive to them with the lapse of time .",
    "the reason seems to come from mass inflation which induces large curvature in the internal structure .",
    "the internal structure determined from the formation seems to be maintained during the evaporation .",
    "we also investigated the neutralization of charged black holes for both non  evaporating and evaporating cases .",
    "as charged black holes obtain some opposite charge , the radial function beyond the outer horizon decreases in both cases , causing the singularity to approach to the outer horizon rapidly in non  evaporating charged black holes . in evaporating charged black holes , obtaining of opposite charge",
    "causes the inner horizon to evolve to a singularity .    finally , we focused on the wormhole  like structure inside of charged black holes which is a worthwhile object of examination because , without any exotic requirements , hawking radiation naturally induces such a structure . from this point of view",
    ", the neutralization of charged black holes can be interpreted as the separation between the inside and the outside of the wormhole  like structure .",
    "it may cause some issues related to the information loss problem ; however , further study is required .",
