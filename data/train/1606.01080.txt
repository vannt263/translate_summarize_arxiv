    "three models which study the stochastic behaviour of the prices of commodities that take into account several aspects of possible influences on the prices were proposed by e schwartz @xcite in the late nineties . in the simplest model ( the so - called one - factor model )",

    "in particular it has been shown that equation ( [ 1fm.01 ] ) is of maximal symmetry , which means that it is invariant under the same group of invariance transformations ( of dimension @xmath15 ) as that of the black - scholes and the heat conduction equation @xcite . the detailed analysis for the lie symmetries of the three models , which were proposed by schwartz , and the generalisation to the @xmath16-factor model",
