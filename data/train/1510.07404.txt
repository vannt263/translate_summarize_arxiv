    "( iii ) in phase 3 , the whole disk becomes optically thick and geometrically thin .",
    "( iv ) in phase 4 , the inner region of the disk begins to become advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) where radiative cooling is inefficient , which is surrounded by a outer thin disk .",

    "we assume that the ns magnetic field is very weak ( @xmath36 g ) , so the disk can reach the surface of the ns . in the future work we will consider the interaction of a strong magnetic field with the disk .",
    "the outer disk spreads due to angular momentum transport @xcite , until it reaches a radius where self - gravity becomes important .",

    "the accretion rate is usually so high that the disk is described by a slim disk model , where radiation pressure dominates and advection can effectively consume most of the heat locally generated @xcite .",
    "while the fallback rate evolves with time @xmath53 @xcite , the accretion rate linked to viscous diffusion follows @xmath54 .",
    "meanwhile , in the slim disk phase possible disk wind loss should be taken into account , so the local accretion rate is assumed to follow a power law of the radius , @xmath55 , where the power - law index @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is believed to be constant @xcite .",
    "if the wind loss is weak ( @xmath58 ) , the accretion rate can be described by @xmath59 , otherwise @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "thus the parameters of the disk vary as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the temperature , and the subscript 0 denotes variables measured at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "from @xcite we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 can be solved from the initial mass of the disk , @xmath66    phase 1 ends at the time @xmath67 when radiative cooling begins to dominate in the outermost region , that is , the transition radius @xmath68 , which separates the inner slim disk region from the outer radiative cooling - dominated region , starts to equal the outer disk radius .",
    "the slim disk region is characterized by both advective cooling and radiation pressure domination .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed calculations show that advection starts to modify the disk structure at local accretion rates @xmath70 @xcite .",

    "accretion onto a ns can be inhibited by the centrifugal barrier unless its spin angular velocity is smaller than the keplerian angular velocity at the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that diffusive and viscous interaction between the magnetosphere and the disk may play an important role in the propeller - driven outflows and there is always a slow accretion flow in the case of weak - propeller systems @xcite . based on this picture , @xcite tried to explain the very faint persistent outburst of xmm j174457@xmath462850.3 .",
    "this model can be tested by future measurements of the spin and the magnetic field of the accreting ns .",
    "here we suggest that an accreting ns ( formed via wd merger ) from a fossil disk may account for part of the vfxt population , considering the fact that @xmath168 1/3 vfxts are ns systems and the optical counterparts , if exist , are either very faint or undetectable . whether the merger remnant can evolve into a vfxt depends on the evolution of the fossil disk , provided that the ns has a weak magnetic field ( @xmath169 g ) .",
    "the key points are whether the disk can be thermally unstable and maintain a very low accretion rate @xmath170 for a sufficiently long time .",
    "the time when the system reaches such low accretion rate is an increasing function of the initial disk mass ( or its formation timescale ) , and is estimated to be @xmath171 yr from our previous calculations .",
    "population synthesis calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the galactic birthrate of nss born via double wd mergers is about @xmath172 yr@xmath20 . adopting a lifetime of @xmath173 yr , we",
    "can then roughly estimate that there might be @xmath168 100 transient nss accreting from a fossil disk , with the properties resembling vfxts .",
    "for such objects , some observational features can distinguish them from those in lmxbs :    \\(i ) no orbital modulations would be displayed in its light curve since there is not any companion star .",
    "\\(ii ) one may expect to detect spectral lines from c or o elements in the disk .",
    "\\(iii ) the delay time for wd mergers can be as short as a few @xmath174 yr @xcite , so wd mergers may trace the star - formation processes .",
    "this may partly explain why there are a rich population of vfxts in the galactic center region .",
    "aic is expected to be an important channel to the formation of msps theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although direct observational evidence is still lacking . in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution of the merger remnant of double wds ( i.e. , a fossil disk around a ns ) , taking into account the effect of the outer radius , which is determined by either self - gravity or neutralization .",
    "we find that the evolution generally consists of four phases .",
    "( i ) in phase 1 , the newborn fossil disk is a slim one , and accretes onto the ns at a super - eddington rate . as a consequence ,",
    "the system should be observed as a very bright persistent source .",
    "however , the duration of the phase is less than 1 yr .",
    "( ii ) in phase 2 , the slim disk gradually evolves to be a thin disk with the decrease of the accretion rate , since radiative cooling becomes effective .",
    "the transition starts from the outer region and develops inwards until the entire disk turns into a thin disk ( within a time @xmath175 yr ) . during the evolution",
    ", the disk is expected to be thermally unstable within @xmath0 100 yr , i.e. , the system changes to a bright transient x - ray source , and the peak x - ray luminosity decreases with time .",
    "the outer disk either is truncated by self - gravity or becomes neutral and stops spreading any more .",
    "( iii ) in phase 3 the whole disk is a thin disk .",
    "the evolution of the thin disk can last @xmath176 yr , during which the x - ray brightness of the transient source becomes even lower .",
    "( iv ) in phase 4 , the thin disk turns into an adaf from the inner region once the accretion rate decrease to @xmath177 , where advective cooling is dominated .    during the disk evolution",
    ", we consider possible wind loss since the accretion rate can be significantly higher or lower than @xmath17 @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "the outer radius of the disk is firstly determined .",
    "based on the estimation , the evolution of the disk with different wind loss indices can then be predicted .",
    "one can estimate when the disk evolves from a slim disk to a thin disk , and when the ns evolves from persistent to transient , depending on the self - gravity truncation or the neutral process . on one hand , the disk will spread more slowly if truncated by the self - gravity . on the other hand",
    ", the self - gravity truncation tends to postpone the occurrence of the neutralization .    based on the calculations , a possible picture of the fossil disk accretion onto an isolated ns",
    "is predicted . unlike previous studies on the early evolution of the fallback disk , here we are interested in the evolution of the post - aic systems at the late phase , during which the source appears faint ( @xmath178 @xmath179 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath5 40 peculiar transients , called vfxts , have been captured by the high - resolution monitors during the past decade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the post - aic systems may be transient within 100 yr and reach a very low accretion rate of @xmath9 at a time @xmath168 yr , implying that the post - aic systems could be the progenitors of some vfxts .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous for clarifying and helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china under grant numbers 11133001 and 11333004 , and the strategic priority research program of cas ( under grant number xdb09000000 ) .",
    "if both the self - gravity truncation and the neutral process are considered , the disk evolution will behave differently , and will be described in the appendix . for simplification ,",
    "the density ( @xmath180 , i=0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) in the following discussions is assumed to be nondimensional .",
    "since the disk in each phase follows the distinct evolution ( section [ sec.2.2 ] ) , the self - gravity truncation can hardly be described by a common function .",
    "if there is self - gravity truncation , we assume that @xmath129 is satisfied unless there is a new state - transition .",
    "depending on the initial parameters , self - gravity truncation can occur at any stage .",
    "in addition , if the wind loss index satisfies @xmath1811 , the outer region will be easily truncated .",
    "moreover , the disk may be truncated at the beginning of phase 1 under specific situations .",
    "firstly , a timescale @xmath182 when @xmath129 , using the evolutionary parameters in phase 1 , is calculated to be , @xmath183 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn.3 ] ) , one can infer that increase of @xmath109 with time ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) is faster than that of @xmath33 with time ( @xmath186 )",
    ". then the disk evolution should be described by @xmath129 from the time point of @xmath26 to that of @xmath187 . in the following ,",
    "we only consider models with @xmath188 . depending on the occurrence of self - gravity truncation ,",
    "the disk evolution can be classified as follows .",
    "\\(i ) if the disk is truncated at @xmath189 , the outer radius evolves in the following laws , @xmath190 where @xmath191^{441/160}.\\label{eqna04}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath192 , we have @xmath193 where @xmath194^{189/247},\\label{eqna06}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and some other parameters are referred to eq .",
    "( [ eqn.11])@xmath46([eqn.18 ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) if self - gravity truncation occurs at @xmath127 , the evolution of the outer radius follows , @xmath195 where @xmath196^{189/59}.\\label{eqna08}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the evolution after @xmath124 can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eqna05 ] ) and ( [ eqna06 ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) in other cases the evolution of the outer radius is given by @xmath197 where @xmath198^{315/16},\\label{eqna10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the following evolution is similar to that described by case  ( i ) .",
    "in the above calculations , the effect of the neutral process is ignored . according to our calculations , the time ( @xmath199 ) for the outer disk to become neutral satisfies @xmath200 .",
    "thus , when @xmath201 , the disk is composed of a hot region ( @xmath202 ) and a cold region @xmath203 , where @xmath204    and the neutralization time @xmath199 can be calculated from the condition @xmath205 , i.e. , @xmath206 where @xmath33 is described by eq .",
    "( [ eqna09 ] ) , based on whether the outer region has been truncated or not before being neutral . substituting eq .",
