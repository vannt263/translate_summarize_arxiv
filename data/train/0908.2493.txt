    "this paper contains an analysis of planar polygon decompositions , focusing on the objective that among all new point - edge distances produced , none should be much smaller than those in the input .",
    "specifically , the _ minimum feature size _ of a noncrossing planar straight line drawing ( a special case of which is the noncrossing set of line segments forming a polygon ) is the minimum distance between two non - touching edges .",
    "our goal is to bound the change in minimum feature size that results from decomposing a polygon into triangles , quadrangles , and so on .",
    "feature size was introduced in the context of meshing @xcite , where it influences the necessary mesh complexity that guarantees certain levels of quality .",
    "see also  @xcite .",
    "another motivating example is the 95-year - old algorithm by lowry @xcite for finding a common dissection of any two polygons of equal area .",
    "this algorithm starts by triangulating the polygon , then using a dissection from 1778 to convert each triangle into a rectangle with a common height @xmath3 equal to half the minimum height of all triangles .",
    "the algorithm uses @xmath4 pieces where @xmath5 is the area of the polygon , and this bound is clearly the best possible for each individual piece .",
    "the issue is that @xmath3 depends on the choice of triangulation .",
    "we show that a triangulation without steiner points could be forced to have @xmath3 arbitrarily small , even if the input polygon has a constant number of vertices and a constant _ spread_. the spread is the ratio of _ diameter _ over minimum feature size  roughly , the ratio between the largest and smallest distances .",
    "we remind the reader that the diameter is the largest distance between any two points in the union of the edges .",
    "the term `` spread '' comes from the analogous measure for point sets  @xcite .",
    "essentially , this paper can be thought of as an implicit study of meshing with the objective of preserving feature size , or equivalently , spread ( meshing does not affect diameter ) .",
    "+   + lowry s algorithm is an example of a _ pseudopolynomial bound_. quite common in problems with integer inputs , pseudopolynomial bounds are polynomial in the input size , @xmath0 , and in the sum of the input integers , often denoted  @xmath6 .",
    "subset sum , for example , has a pseudopolynomial - time algorithm , but has no polynomial - time algorithm unless p = np , being weakly np - complete @xcite .",
    "pseudopolynomial bounds are also common in computational geometry , where problems have real inputs such as point coordinates .",
    "one approach is to assume that the real inputs are rationals , which includes most representations of real numbers on a digital computer , scale them all to become integers , and let @xmath6 be the sum of the resulting integers .",
    "however , some geometries , especially the outputs of geometric algorithms , are impossible to represent with rational coordinates . for this reason",
    ", computational geometers generally prefer the _ real ram _ model of computation , where each input can be any real number , and algorithms have the ability to do only basic arithmetic , radical , and sign computations on these real numbers .",
    "the usual approach for a pseudopolynomial bound on a real ram is to measure the effective resolution of the input using basic geometric quantities .",
    "a pseudopolynomial bound might be polynomial in the input size @xmath0 and in the spread  @xmath7 .",
    "note that , as with problems with ( distinct ) integers , @xmath8 , here we have a ( slightly weaker ) bound of @xmath9 .",
    "while many algorithms attain pseudopolynomial bounds , e.g. , on running time , and thus depend on spread , few algorithms consider the spread of their output , as we have seen in our example .",
    "this omission becomes important when trying to chain algorithms together .",
    "thus one can see the importance of our objective of obtaining a bounded increase in feature size when producing a decomposition .",

    "the spread , @xmath13 , is @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in subdividing an @xmath0-sided polygon @xmath15 into a planar straight - line drawing @xmath10 such that the minimum feature size  of @xmath10 is as close as possible to that of @xmath15 .",
    "we call the ratio @xmath16 the _ degradation _ of the decomposition of @xmath15 into @xmath10 .",
    "in this paper we bound the degradation in terms of @xmath0 , for various common types of decompositions .",
    "we will be looking at three types of decompositions , known as _ triangulations _",
    ", where the interior of @xmath15 is partitioned into triangles . see figure  [ triangulationtypes - fig ] .",
    "the most common decomposition of a polygon is the _ classic triangulation _ , where non - crossing chords are added between vertices of @xmath15 , until the interior of @xmath15 is partitioned into triangles .",
    "more general types of triangulations allow the addition of vertices ( known as _ steiner _",
    "points ) on or inside @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider two such triangulations ; a _ proper _ triangulation forbids the placement of steiner points in the interior of any edge .",
    "in other words , no two edges incident to a common steiner point are collinear . in the dual graph of the triangulation all vertices have degree at most 3 .",
    "non - proper _ triangulation simply partitions @xmath15 into triangles , with no restrictions .",
    "three types of _ quadrangulations _ , or in general @xmath17-rangulations , are defined analogously .          in section  [ noclassic ]",
    "we show that classic @xmath17-rangulations , for any @xmath17 , can not guarantee low degradation of minimum feature size .",
    "specifically , we show all classic @xmath17-rangulations of a regular @xmath0-gon have a minimum feature size  degradation of @xmath2 . in section  [ properlb ]",

    ".,width=163 ]    clearly , lemma  [ parentlemma ] holds regardless of the direction chosen for the ray . in general for a given direction , we say that the selected vertex @xmath48 is the _ parent _ of @xmath112 .",
    "given positive integers @xmath0 and @xmath17 , let @xmath116 be the polygon illustrated in figure  [ lbproper ] .",

    "first , observe that no steiner points can be placed in the interior of the bottom edge of the critical region @xmath37 , because they would be less than one unit away from the diagonal edge .",
    "since the decomposition is proper , each of the @xmath0 vertices at the top of @xmath37 must be incident to chords .",
    "these chords may end at the lower two vertices of @xmath37 , or at steiner points within @xmath37 , or may lead outside of @xmath37 via its left / right edges .",
    "notice that at most @xmath125 chords can cross either of the left / right edges of @xmath37 , since the length of those edges is @xmath17 .",
    "now consider the set of vertices in @xmath37 , including any steiner vertices added in a @xmath7-rangular decomposition .",
    "for each of these vertices , we choose the downward direction to construct parent relations , according to lemma  [ parentlemma ] .",
    "the only vertices that are not assigned parents are the two located on the bottom edge of @xmath37 .",
    "thus the  sinks \" , i.e. vertices where the parent hierarchy ends , are the two bottom vertices and/or vertices outside @xmath37 .",
    "these relations form a forest of trees , with a total of @xmath0 leaves on the top edge of @xmath37 .",
    "note that the number of trees is at most @xmath126 since we have established that this is the number of chords that can exit @xmath37 .",
    "thus one of these trees , @xmath24 , must have at least @xmath127 leaves .",
    "according to theorem  [ degree ] , in a decomposition of a @xmath128 rectangle , the degree of any vertex must be @xmath129 in order to preserve a unit minimum feature size . this implies that @xmath24 has height @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , the same bound holds for the vertical distance from root to leaf , since each parent pointer represents a vertical separation of at least one unit , spread over at most @xmath113 vertices ( where @xmath7 is a constant ) .    however , by construction we know that this vertical distance is at most @xmath17 .",
    "so we obtain @xmath131 .",
    "theorem  [ logloglog ] tells us that by selecting @xmath132 , the minimum feature size  will drop from @xmath17 to 1 .",
    "thus we obtain the following .    for any constant @xmath7",
    ", there exist @xmath0-gons for which all proper @xmath7-rangulations have a degradation of @xmath133 .",
    "in this section we show how to construct a non - proper quadrangulation for any polygon , such that the minimum feature size  degradation is @xmath19 .",
    "we use @xmath1 steiner points , and the construction can be computed in linear time . + let @xmath134 be an @xmath0-gon with minimum feature size  1 . consider the well - known _ grassfire transformation _ , @xmath135 , commonly used to visualize the formation of the medial axis of a polygon @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath135 is the result of shrinking @xmath15 by lighting a fire along its boundary , and assuming that the fire will progress at unit speed and will last for @xmath136 units of time . if @xmath15 has unit minimum feature size , @xmath135 will produce a connected region as long as @xmath137 .",
    "we construct the curve @xmath138g()@xmath139 .",
    "once more we apply the grassfire transformation , this time to @xmath140 , but we expand outward .",
    "in some sense we are computing @xmath141 , where the inverse sign denotes outward expansion .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath142 is contained in @xmath143 .",
    "thus we have constructed a  tube \" of constant width 1/5 , confined between @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "our tube has the property that any point inside it has distance at least 1/5 to @xmath15 .",
    "this is important because we intend to place steiner vertices in the tube , specifically in the vicinity of each bend .",
    "in fact we will construct a polygon with boundary contained in the tube .",
    "the tube consists of @xmath0 bends , one per vertex of @xmath15 .",
    "each bend consists of a ",
    "greater \" circular arc ( spanning an angle of at most @xmath145 ) , a  minor \" co - circular arc ( possibly a degenerate point , spanning the same angle at constant distance 1/5 from the greater arc ) , and two segments of length 1/5 , joining the arc endpoints ( at right angles ) .",
    "let us call the two segments _ doors_. between each bend ( from door to door ) , the tube has a rectangular shape of width 1/5 .",
    "we will loosely construct our ( steiner ) polygon , by providing a circular region for the location of each vertex .",
    "these circles will have a diameter of 1/20 , i.e. a quarter of the tube s width . later on we will fix the precise location of each vertex in its region .",
    "each circle will have its center on a specific curve which we call the tube s _ track_. the track is constructed as follows . within each bend , from door to door , the track is co - circular to the bend at a constant distance of 1/40 from the greater arc . between two bends ,",
    "the track is a straight connecting segment .",
    "now we can fill the track with circles , evenly spacing them so that two consecutive circles are 1/20 apart .",
    "the first and last circles added may be 3/20 apart , but then we can re - position everything and the spacing will become slightly larger , without affecting our claims .",
    "a  greater \" arc has length at most @xmath146 , so the track within one bend has length at most @xmath147 .",
    "thus the number of circles intersecting each bend is constant ( roughly 25 , at most .",
    "in fact this can probably be reduced to around 3 - 4 ) .",
    "we delete all circles not intersecting a bend .",
    "thus the total number of circles ( and steiner vertices ) will be @xmath148 .",
    "now we superimpose our entire structure on a square grid of resolution 1/40 .",
    "this means that every circle will contain at least one grid point . for each circle",
    "we choose such a point as a steiner vertex .",
    "next we join the steiner vertices in the order of the circles appearing on the track .",
    "this creates a polygon @xmath149 .",
    "the size of the circles is small enough that any polygon connecting them will not intersect @xmath142 .",
    "an equivalent statement is to say that the convex hull of two consecutive circles avoids @xmath142 .",
    "this is trivially true for the rectangular components , and for any bend where the smaller arc is on @xmath140 . on the other hand",
    "if the bend s greater arc is on @xmath140 , the only edge of the hull that could intersect @xmath142 is the segment @xmath150 tangent to the circles , closest to @xmath142 . consider the circular arc @xmath36 that is 1/4 of the way from @xmath140 to @xmath142 .",
    "the two circles fit tightly in the sub - tube between @xmath36 and @xmath140 .",
    "we place two segments , tangent to the two circles in question , and orthogonal to @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath151 and @xmath152 be the intersection points of the segments with @xmath36 .",
    "every point on the segment between @xmath151 and @xmath152 is closer to @xmath142 than @xmath150 is .",
    "thus it suffices to establish that this segment does not intersect @xmath142 .",
    "the arc corresponding to this segment is the angle spanned by three circles .",
    "as established earlier , this angle is a constant ( roughly @xmath153 ) .",
    "thus the closest point of the segment to the lesser arc of the bend is also a constant .",
    "thus the separation between @xmath15 and @xmath53 is at least 1/5 .",
    "furthermore , it can be verified that no two steiner vertices within a bend will have a separation smaller than that between consecutive vertices .",
    "what remains is to prove that no two bends are close to each other ( in other words , we must prove that the steiner vertices of @xmath53 are sufficiently separated ) .",
    "every bend is associated with a vertex of @xmath15 , or , to put it differently , with two consecutive edges of @xmath15 .",
    "we know that every steiner vertex of a bend has distance at most 2/5 from both associated edges of @xmath15 .",
    "when we compare steiner vertices from two different bends , we can identify one associated edge from each bend , such that the chosen edges are entirely disjoint ( i.e. they do nt even have a common endpoint ) . since those two edges must have a separation of at least 1 , we can conclude that the two groups of steiner vertices have separation at least 1/5 .    at this point",
    ", we can conclude that the union of @xmath15 and @xmath53 has a minimum feature size  of @xmath19 .",
    "we can also add chords from each @xmath52 to all the steiner vertices in its associated bend .",
    "this creates several triangles that are roughly isosceles and have a common apex . since the angle of each such triangle at the common apex is a constant , the separation between the newly introduced chords and their opposite vertices is also constant . as a result ,",
    "the zone @xmath154 between @xmath15 and @xmath53 becomes quadrangulated , with constant feature size .",
    "let @xmath24 be the trapezoidal decomposition of @xmath53 resulting from extending horizontal rays from each of its vertices .",
    "the construction of @xmath24 places an additional @xmath148 steiner vertices on @xmath53 ( i.e. on the inner boundary of @xmath154 ) .",
    "the minimum feature size  of @xmath24 is @xmath19 since all its vertices are on our grid of resolution 1/40 .",
    "horizontal lines are 1/40 apart , which means all new vertices are at least 1/40 apart from other vertices , old or new . since the new vertices are on @xmath53 , they are at a safe distance from the boundary of @xmath15 as well .",
    "thus we conclude the following .",
    "the planar straight line drawing consisting of the union of @xmath154 and @xmath24 is a non - proper quadrangulation with a constant minimum feature size .",
