    "global @xmath1 symmetry breaking plays a crucial role in many aspects of particle physics and field theories .",
    "cosmic strings are generated associated with the @xmath1 symmetry breaking in the cosmic history and hence are the key solitons to probe information of the early universe or to prove ( or disprove ) a phenomenological model @xcite .",
    "one of the most important global @xmath1 symmetries is the @xmath0 symmetry in supersymmetric theories . since supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is broken at low - energy scales , we must live in a vacuum with nonvanishing potential energy , which requires exact @xmath0 symmetry if the vacuum is the global minimum . on the other hand ,",
    "exact @xmath0 symmetry prohibits nonzero majorana gaugino mass . in this reason ,",
    "relatively complicated vacuum structure that contains both true susy vacua and false vacua with approximate @xmath0 symmetry ( broken explicitly or spontaneously ) is now energetically studied for low - energy model building in the phenomenological point of view .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews . ) when a false vacuum is selected in such models after inflation , the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken and it gives rise to cosmic r - strings , which can not be avoided in a high scale inflation or a high reheating temperature scenario .",
    "cosmic strings in some models of this class have a peculiar feature .",
    "if a lower @xmath1 preserving vacuum exists , the field configuration in the string core falls down to the lower vacuum .",
    "therefore , the strings have inner structure that is tube - like domain wall configuration .",
    "note that since the lower vacuum is energetically favored , the interior of the string core possibly starts to expand @xcite , and the universe is eventually filled by the true vacuum , where susy is recovered .",
    "this situation is inconsistent with our universe .    besides this extreme case",
    ", it has been also reported that there is parameter space where the meta - stable tube - like strings exist @xcite",
    ". however , naively thinking , such an object would be unstable against any disturbance , and follow the same fate as the above case . actually , once multiple strings are formed by the breaking of @xmath0 in the cosmic history , they are inevitably affected by the violent dynamical processes like collision and reconnection .",
    "taking such kinds of dynamical processes of meta - stable r - strings into account , it is non - trivial whether the tube - like strings become unstable or keep their stability throughout their collision process .",
    "thus , it is very important to study the collision dynamics and figure out the ( in)stability of the tube - like r - strings , which has a tight relationship with the possibility to constrain the model building for realistic susy breaking and @xmath0 breaking .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamical stability / instability for the strings under the reconnection . for the sake of this study , we perform the field - theoretic simulations of the collision of two meta - stable strings described as a solitonic solution in the model of a classical complex scalar field with a potential including a true vacuum and a meta - stable vacuum . for the simulations ,",
    "we particularly focus on the two physical parameters characterising the collision process ; the relative velocity and the angle of two colliding strings . as a result",
    ", we find that the stability of the system strongly depends on these parameters and that surprisingly there is a wide parameter space where the system is stable against the collision .",
    "this work implies the importance of taking into account the dynamics of the meta - stable objects generated in the susy breaking and @xmath0 breaking models .",
    "although this system can not produce the cosmic string network via the kibble mechanism , the process of the string collision would catch up the feature of more realistic situations . at any rate",
    ", it is very useful to reveal novel phenomena by exploiting a simple model which would be shared by a wide class of theories .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we set up the model and show numerical solutions for static metastable strings . in section iii , by using approximations , we estimate the maximum winding number of a metastable string and study analytically instability of colliding two strings . in section iv",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of colliding strings by three - dimensional simulations .",
    "we survey parameter dependence of instability by varying the collision angle and the relative speed of strings .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions and discussions . in appendix",
    ", we briefly explain our scheme for numerical studies .",
    "to illustrate growing instability of metastable strings under reconnections and show generality of such phenomena , we consider a simple single field model with false and true vacua .",
    "this is an ideal example to demonstrate various aspects of the collision dynamics of two metastable solitons which would be common in a wide class of models .",
    "the lagrangian of a complex scalar field @xmath2 which carries a charge of global @xmath1 symmetry is given by @xmath3 we engineer a false vacuum and a true vacuum by employing the following sixth order of the potential , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a dimensionless constant determining the amplitude of a local minimum of @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "this potential has the global minimum at @xmath8 where @xmath9 , a local maximum at @xmath10 , and a local minimum at @xmath11 , which are given by @xmath12 here we introduced several dimensionless quantities , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig : potentialshape ] shows the schematic picture of this potential .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation we solve in section iv for simulations of colliding strings is given by @xmath16    in the false vacuum , the global @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "we simply assume that a global string is formed .",
    "consider a static cylindrical solution of the field equation in the cylindrical coordinate , @xmath17 .",
    "first we decompose @xmath2 into the radial and angular parts , @xmath18 then the explicit form of the equation of @xmath19 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "we look for the solution where the scalar field in the interior of the string stays in the true vacuum , and that stays in the meta - stable vacuum at the exterior .",
    "that is , such a solution should satisfy @xmath22 at @xmath23 and @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "here we emphasize that there can be a ( meta)stable tube - like solution .",
    "since the string core has lower energy density than that of its exterior , larger string radius seems to be favorable for the system , which predicts the roll - over process .",
    "however , there must be the domain wall between its core and exterior , whose energy becomes larger for larger string radius . as a result , there arises a ( meta)stable tube - like solution , depending on the parameters .",
    "we will see it in more detail in the next section .",

    ", there is a domain wall which is the surface of the tube / cylinder .",
    "it is found that the radius of the tube / cylinder depends on the winding number , @xmath34 , and the higher - winding solution tends to be thicker .",
    "moreover , the thickness of the domain wall is quite insensitive to the winding number .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrate numerical solutions for the static tube - like string . before we consider the detailed estimation of their structure , we here give a rough approximation and clarify the stability of those solutions by using a simple thin - wall approximation .",
    "it is obvious that the stability of the tube - like string depends on the difference in the energy density of the true and false vacua @xmath35 when @xmath36 @xmath37 , the vacua inside and outside the string have the same energy .",
    "then the tube - like string is stable because it is supported by the topological reason . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath38 is large enough , the core energy density wins out and the string grows and expands .",
    "thus , one expects that there exists a metastable tube - like string in an intermediate range for @xmath38 .",
    "let us clarify this by using the thin - wall approximation where the wall of the string is thin compared to the core and the exterior .",
    "the thin wall s contribution to the energy density can be approximated by the constant surface energy , @xmath39 .",
    "then , the tension of the string with radius @xmath40 is estimated by @xmath41 where the first term is the contribution of the flux of the @xmath1 global current with @xmath42 being a cutoff scale and @xmath43 being a constant of a mass dimension 2 , the second term is of the wall and the last term is of the core of the tube - like string . here",

    "the tube - like string whose core radius is larger than @xmath50 is unstable .",
    "when @xmath38 exceeds the critical value , @xmath51 , there are no local minima at all .",
    "namely , the string is unstable and the string core expands infinitely . in this paper",
    "the metastable strings are concerned .",
    "although they are metastable as static configurations , they will become unstable in some dynamical processes such as string collision , annihilation and reconnections .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : schematic ] ) with @xmath34 being zero , the fate of the two - dimensional bubble can be also clarified .",

    "once the positive @xmath53 is turned on , the bubble becomes metastable .",
    "the critical radius of the bubble is @xmath54 .",
    "the bubble lager than @xmath55 expands infinitely and the true vacua inside the core wins out .",
    "there are no metastable tube - like solutions .",
    "the thin - wall approximation explained above is simple and gives an insight about the stability problem .",
    "nevertheless , it is of only limited accuracy and we need a better analysis to get more quantitative results beyond the qualitative properties . to go beyond the thin - wall approximation",
    ", we will work out another analytical study in the next subsections .",
    "now let us go beyond the thin - wall approximation and consider the stability of the tube - like solution in more detail . from the numerical calculations of stable static solutions",
    ", we found that the tube - like solution is well characterized by the radius of cylinders , @xmath40 , the winding number , and the thickness of the walls , @xmath56 . since the thickness of the wall is quite insensitive to other two parameters , it is possible to estimate @xmath56 from the variation of the total energy @xmath57 with respect to @xmath56 , and it can be done by considering only the case of @xmath58 .",
