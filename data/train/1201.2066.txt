    "the ability to trap ultracold atomic gases and load them in optical lattices has led to the tantalizing possibility to create in a laboratory almost ideal realizations of popular condensed - matter models and to observe their remarkable properties  @xcite .",
    "one after the other , the cold atoms route has met many fascinating milestones like the observation of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in a system of bosons on a lattice  @xcite , the direct imaging of the fermi surface in a degenerate fermi gas  @xcite , the demonstration of superfluidity in an interacting fermi gas  @xcite .",
    "one of the frontiers of this research  @xcite is the realization of the mott insulating limit for fermions in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the most outstanding feature of this field is the amazing degree of control and tunability . while in solid state models like ,",
    "e.g. the hubbard model should be viewed only as approximate low - energy effective pictures with parameters hard to estimate and control , optical lattices allow to tune the interaction strength and other relevant parameters by simply changing the experimental setup .",
    "a well - known example is the possibility to control the value of the interatomic interactions by means of a magnetic field exploiting fano - feschbach resonances .",
    "this allows not only to study the evolution of the physics as a function of the `` standard '' control parameters ( like the interaction or the particle density ) , but also to introduce new parameters which can strongly affect known phenomena or lead to entirely new quantum phases .",
    "binary mixtures of fermionic atoms with different masses ( e.g. @xmath0li , @xmath1k ) introduce one of such additional parameters , namely the difference between the hopping amplitudes of the two kinds of fermions .",
    "if the two fermionic species hop with a different probability amplitude or , in more colloquial words , move at different velocities , familiar phenomena for equal - mass binary mixtures ( which mimic spin-1/2 electrons in solids ) can be modified and new physics may take place .",
    "the phase diagram at zero temperature has been worked out in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case  @xcite for repulsive and attractive interactions and for attractive interactions in the three dimensional case  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the focus has been on the broken - symmetry phases ( superfluid , charge- and spin - ordered states ) , while this work is devoted to the so - called mott transition , a transition from a fluid to an insulator driven by the local repulsion on a lattice populated by as many fermions as there are lattice sites ( half - filled model ) .",
    "the problem of two kinds of carriers with different hoppings is also reminiscent of solid - state systems in which two or more bands with different bandwidths are involved in the conduction . in this situation ,",
    "the possibility of an orbital - selective mott transition , in which only one ( or a few ) band becomes insulating because of the electron - electron interaction , while another ( or others ) maintains a metallic behavior  @xcite has been lively debated .    in this work",
    ", we will investigate the fate of such two - component imbalanced mixtures when the repulsive local interaction is switched on and gradually increased .",
    "our knowledge about the limiting cases of a completely balanced mixture ( the well - known hubbard model ) and the limit in which one species is completely localized ( i.e. it has zero hopping ) , described by the so - called falicov - kimball model , already suggests that the evolution between these two situations will be far from trivial .    in the balanced case ,",
    "the mechanism leading to the mott transition has been elucidated by means of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , the same method we use in this work . within this approach ,",
    "when the correlation strength is increased , the motion of the fermions gradually becomes more difficult , and the effective hopping is reduced .",
    "when the correlation reaches a critical value in which the hopping is renormalized to zero , the system becomes a mott insulator . for interactions smaller than the critical value",
    "the system is always a fermi - liquid , a normal fluid with well - defined long - lived excitations at low - energy , like standard metals in solid - state physics . in the falicov - kimball model",
    "@xcite one of the fermionic species is not mobile . as a result ,",
    "the mobile species too has a non - standard behavior and , even before the mott transition occurs at large interactions , it does not behave like a normal fermi - liquid .",
    "therefore the evolution between the two limits should determine a destruction of the fermi - liquid induced not only by the interaction , but also by the mass imbalance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present the model and we introduce the dynamical - mean field theory method . in sec .  [ sec : massrenorm ] , we present the results for the quasiparticle renormalization and the phase diagram . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral ] , we study the spectral functions for weak and strong couplings , while sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "we consider two - component fermionic mixtures loaded in a three - dimensional optical lattice , allowing the two species to have different masses , or , more generally , different hopping amplitudes .",
    "we will henceforth refer to the two species as `` light '' and `` heavy '' . under conditions discussed ,",
    "e.g. in refs .",
    ", fermionic mixtures in optical lattices are described by a hubbard model in which the lattice sites correspond to the minima of the optical potential : @xmath2 the index @xmath3 refers to the light ( @xmath4 ) and heavy ( @xmath5 ) fermionic species ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the existence of interspecies feschbach resonances between @xmath7li and @xmath1k has been demonstrated by refs .  , and allows for both an attractive or repulsive interaction with a tunable strength , as assumed in ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the case in which the number of fermions equals the number of lattice sites ( half - filling ) with a repulsive interaction . under this condition ,",
    "a mott transition is possible as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "our focus will be to characterize how the mott transition occurs for different values of the mass imbalance ratio which we define as @xmath9 , a quantity which goes from @xmath10 ( balanced system ) to @xmath11 ( falicov - kimball limit ) .",
    "we also define an average hopping @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on fluid states without considering the antiferromagnetic instability which is expected to occur at low - temperatures .",
    "even if our solutions will not be representative of the actual groundstate of the model , they will properly describe the system at the finite temperatures at which the experiments can be carried out .",
    "we notice in passing that the results for the attractive model can be obtained directly by using a particle - hole transformation  @xcite . here",
    "the mott transition is mapped onto a pairing transition in which a fermi liquid becomes an insulating state formed by localized `` pairs ''  @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", we use dmft , one of the most popular modern theoretical approaches designed to treat correlated fermions on a lattice .",
    "one of the main advantages of dmft over other approaches is that it does not require any assumptions on the values of the coupling terms appearing in the hamiltonian , and indeed becomes exact both in the small and in the strong interaction limit for any value of the imbalance @xmath13 .",
    "a practical implementation of dmft requires the self - consistent solution of a quantum impurity model , i.e. a model of a single - interacting site coupled to a bath that allows for quantum fluctuations on the correlated site . in the mean - field spirit",
    "the site is representative of any site of the original lattice .",
    "this correspondence is implemented via a self - consistency condition which contains the information about the original lattice .",
    "more precisely the hybridization with the bath is parameterized by a frequency - dependent `` weiss field '' @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hybridization function .",
    "the general form of the self - consistency equation ( we write it for simplicity for the normal fluid phase , but its generalization to the broken - symmetry phases is straightforward ) is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the local self - energy , @xmath18 is the non - interacting density of states .    in this work",
    "we use a semicircular density of states @xmath19 with half - bandwidth @xmath20 , for which ( [ eq : sc ] ) is greatly simplified and becomes @xmath21    the above density of states has been shown to satisfactorily reproduce results in three spatial dimensions with the half - bandwidth related to the nearest - neighbor hopping in three dimensions by the relation @xmath22 .",
    "we can obviously define an average half - bandwidth @xmath23 , and observe that the definition of @xmath13 can be reexpressed in terms of @xmath20 as @xmath24 . for more details on dmft",
    ", we refer to ref .  .",
    "in very general terms , the main effect of the interparticle interaction @xmath8 is to reduce the mobility of the fermions .",
    "this phenomenon , which eventually leads to the mott localization , is measured by the effective mass of the carriers @xmath25 . within dmft @xmath25",
    "is the inverse of the quasiparticle weight defined by @xmath26 / \\mathrm{d } \\omega\\big|_{\\omega=0 } \\big)$ ] . for a non - interacting system @xmath27 , while the localization is associated to a vanishing @xmath28 corresponding to an infinite effective mass . a small value of @xmath28 is the signature of a highly - correlated quantum fluid . here , because the two species have different bare masses and hoppings , a different renormalization is expected and the outcome is not obvious .    in the case of two different bands in a solid , both carrying up and down electrons ,",
    "it is natural that the heavy band , which has a smaller @xmath29 is more affected by the interaction than the light one .",
    "therefore the former will be more renormalized than the latter , and the ratio between the renormalized hoppings @xmath30 will be larger than that of the bare hoppings @xmath31 .",
    "this opens the way to a possible orbital - selective mott transition in which the renormalized heavy - band hopping goes to zero , while the light one remains metallic .",
    "the actual realization of the transition depends on several factors , but the qualitative behavior of the renormalization factors universally follows the above expectations  @xcite .    in principle this effect ( heavy fermions being more sensitive to the correlations ) can take place also in our two - component mixture , but another effect competes with it . when the system is at half - filling ( or close ) and the correlation is strong , we essentially have one fermion on each lattice site , even in the itinerant state just before a mott transition . in this situation , in order to move one light fermion , we are bound to move it on a site which is already populated by a heavy one ( pauli principles forbids to have two fermions of the same species on the same site ) and then move the heavy one on the site previously occupied by the moved light fermion .",
    "this means that , in order to move the light fermions , we are forced to move the heavy ones as well .",
    "when we are in this regime , we expect the renormalization factors @xmath28 to compensate the hopping imbalance . in other words",
    "we expect @xmath32 , in contrast with the case of two bands in a solid .",
    "even more simply , close to the mott transition , the motion of each carrier is correlated to that of any other , and there is no energy gain in having one species moving faster than the other .",
    "our dmft analysis will prove that this latter effect is the dominant one .          before presenting the full numerical solution of dmft and discussing the quasiparticle properties in details ,",
    "we show analytical results for the critical interaction @xmath33 obtained using a further approximation which has proved reliable in the balanced hubbard model , the linearized dmft approximation ( l - dmft )  @xcite .",
    "this method approximates the dmft weiss field with a single - pole function and it is expected to be accurate close to the mott transition . for details on this approximation , we refer the reader to the original paper  @xcite .",
    "let us summarize here the main results for the mass - imbalanced case . within l - dmft",
    "the hybridization function is simply given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hybridization between the approximate bath and the impurity .",
    "close to the critical @xmath36 for the mott transition we can approximate the quasiparticle weights to second order in @xmath37 : @xmath38 for a semicircular dos the dmft self - consistency condition for each species implies  @xcite @xmath39 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zl]),([eq : zh ] ) and  ( [ eq : sccl ] ) lead to a quartic equation for @xmath40 : @xmath41 which has a single physically - relevant solution @xmath42 implying , using eq .",

    "the difference in the bare mass , the easier it is to localize the system .",
    "the l - dmft result for the critical interaction as a function of @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mott_transition ] as a dashed line .",
    "we now turn to the full dmft solution .",
    "we use two different impurity solvers , the numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite , which is particularly accurate for low - energy features , and the exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite , an unbiased method which however introduces some approximation to the spectra being represented as a sum of discrete poles ( here we approximated the bath with seven discrete levels ) .",
    "both methods work at zero temperature . in the nrg calculations we set the discretization parameter @xmath51 and we keep 500 states at each nrg iteration .",
    "the spectral densities are computed following refs . .",
    "in the ed solution we discretize the bath using a total number of levels @xmath52 having verified that this number is sufficient to obtain converged results .     at the fermi level as a function of the interaction strength @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( upper panel ) and @xmath55 ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    at the fermi level as a function of the interaction strength @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( upper panel ) and @xmath55 ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : edvsnrg_z ] shows the quasiparticle weight of both species for two different mass imbalances @xmath56 .",
    "the very good agreement between ed and nrg represents a non - trivial test for the accuracy of our calculations . both for the small imbalance and the strong imbalance cases we find that the light fermions are more renormalized ( i.e. they have a smaller @xmath57 ) compared to their heavy partners , even if the effect is much more pronounced for @xmath58 .",
    "our solution therefore shows that the second physical effect that we described above prevails already for moderately imbalanced mixtures : when two species with different mobility are mixed , the interactions tend to balance their properties .",
    "it is however important to underline that the reduction of @xmath59 does not perfectly balance the renormalized hoppings and the effect is far from being trivial ( as already suggested by eq .",
    "[ eq : zrat ] ) .    repeating the calculations for different values of @xmath13 we constructed the phase diagram for the mott transition from a fluid to an insulator in the @xmath60 plane , which we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : mott_transition ] together with the analytical formula ( [ uc_ldmft ] ) from l - dmft .",
    "the numerical result obtained with full dmft ( ed and nrg give indistinguishable results ) are slightly above the l - dmft predictions , but follow a very similar behavior , which bridges between the value for the balanced model @xmath61 and that of the falicov - kimball model @xmath62 . as we will discuss in the following , the metallic region below @xmath33 is always a fermi liquid except for the falicov - kimball limit @xmath63 , where the fermi - liquid picture breaks down .",
    "nonetheless , moving along the @xmath13 axis , there is a continuous reduction of the coherence of the metallic phase .",
    "in the previous section we have analyzed how the effective mass of the two species of fermions evolves as a function of @xmath8 and we have drawn a phase diagram in the imbalance - correlation plane which highlights how the fluid state turns into a mott insulator .",
    "we now extend our analysis to the spectral functions , which contain information about the excitation spectrum for each species .",
    "this is a key quantity to characterize the nature of the itinerant states and the approach to the insulating state . in particular",
    ", we can identify if the system presents long - lived low - energy excitations and the characteristic energy scale below which the fermionic motion is coherent despite the interaction between the species .",
    "most interestingly , spectral functions are experimentally accessible in trapped cold atomic systems  @xcite via radio - spectroscopy  @xcite or raman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore computed @xmath64 within dmft using nrg as impurity solver@xcite .",
    "indeed , this method allows for an arbitrarily - fine resolution at low frequency , where the most interesting physics will take place . we will show that for all values of @xmath13 the system is a normal fermi liquid for @xmath65 , even if the coherence energy scale can be very small and , more interestingly , highly species - dependent .",
    "due to the momentum - independence of the self - energy within dmft , a fermi - liquid behavior implies that the spectral function at @xmath66 is pinned to its non - interacting value  @xcite . for our model at half - filling , this implies @xmath67 for both species .",
    "for this reason , we always plot @xmath68 , a quantity which goes to one for @xmath66 when the system is a fermi liquid .",
    "we start our analysis from the weak - coupling regime , choosing @xmath69 for the sake of definiteness . for small values of the imbalance",
    ", the system is expected to behave like a standard fermi liquid with slightly different renormalizations for the two species .",
    "on the other hand , the large - imbalance limit can provide non - standard physics even when the correlation strength is moderate .",
    "therefore we only focus on relatively large values of @xmath13 from 0.8 to 0.9998 .     and @xmath70 . the @xmath71-axis",
    "is renormalized by @xmath72 and the spectral functions @xmath73 are multiplied by @xmath74 .",

    "this case can be mapped onto a well - known solid - state problem , the absorption of x - rays in a metal , for which we refer to refs .  .",
    "within this mapping , the properties of the heavy fermionic species correspond to the core level of the metal , whose spectral function has a distinctive power - law behavior at low frequency  @xcite : @xmath77 our dmft results show that this result still holds over a given frequency range at finite values of the imbalance and weak values of the interaction",
    ". the accuracy of nrg - dmft calculations in the evaluation of the power - law behavior has been demonstrated , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite through a comparison with exact results .",

    "the spectra eventually deviate from this power - law behavior and construct a low - energy peak .",

    "[ fig : alu0.5 ] shows the spectral functions of the light species for the considered values of @xmath13 . in order to obtain a suitable comparison , we rescale again the energy by @xmath86 .",
    "we remark that , interestingly , the spectral functions of the light species @xmath87 also have different behaviors corresponding to the same energy scales we discussed for the heavy species . in the energy regime @xmath89 ,",
    "all spectral functions collapse onto the same curve . at these energies ,",
    "the spectral function of the light species behaves as if the heavy particles had an infinite mass and follows the behavior expected for a falicov - kimball system .",
    "hence , all @xmath87 have the same behavior when we renormalize the energy scale by the hopping parameter .",
    "by contrast , at low energy ( @xmath90 ) , the finite mass of the heavy particles becomes apparent and the spectral function develops a peak structure .",
    "if we rescale the energy @xmath71 by the hopping of the _ heavy _",
    "fermions @xmath72 , the low - energy part of the different spectra again collapse on a single curve which can be nicely fitted by a lorentzian ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig : alu0.5 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the width of these lorentzian peaks is proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "this result can be understood as follows : at low energy , the nature of the correlations between heavy and light species changes .",
    "while at high energies the interaction between species destroys the coherence of the light species and generate a cascade of particle - hole excitations in the spectrum of the heavy species , at low energies they generate a new fermi liquid with a renormalized mass for both light and heavy species .",

    "the peak becomes narrow and eventually vanishes in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "the main qualitative difference with respect to the mott transition obtained in the balanced model as a function of the interaction strength is that in the present case there is no separation between the metallic peak and the hubbard bands , and the gap opens continuously at the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we remind that in the balanced model a precursor of the mott gap opens already in the metallic phase , so that the metallic peak is separated from the hubbard bands and the gap at the transition point is already finite .",
    "the continuous opening of the gap when @xmath13 increases is however not surprising because in the limit @xmath103 one has to recover the falicov - kimball model which shows a continuous opening of the gap at the metal insulator transition .     and",

    "therefore the experimental detection of this peak is very hard in the present experimental situation , where the temperature is hardly lower than a sizeable fraction of the fermi energy @xmath123 .",
    "however , the fingerprints of our anomalous state can be observed even when the temperature washes out the narrow coherent peak since the spectral function will be completely different from a standard fermi liquid .",
    "in particular the spectral function will show a dip at zero energy corresponding to an incipient localization of the carriers even if the system is not fully gapped , a feature which can be reasonably observed in present experiments . a further obstacle to",
    "the detection of the incoherent metallic state comes from the competition with the antiferromagnetic state . at low temperature",
    "the system is expected to antiferromagnetically order at least in bipartite lattice without frustration . nevertheless , the physics associated to the mott localization of the fermions can still be observed at finite temperatures above the nel temperature , as it has been demonstrated in the field of solid state , where , for example , the finite temperature properties of v@xmath124o@xmath125 have been shown to follow the behavior predicted by dmft once the temperature exceeds the nel temperature@xcite .",
    "we finally note that an ideal candidate for an experimental check , the @xmath7li/@xmath1k mixture , has been realized with well controllable interspecies feschbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "a simple numerical estimate shows that the hopping imbalance @xmath13 can be varied over a large range by changing the lattice depth @xmath126 ( @xmath127 at small @xmath126 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 ) , realizing the regimes of @xmath13 where we identified the most striking anomalies both in the quasiparticle renormalization and in the spectral properties .",
