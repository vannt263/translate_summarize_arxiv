    "it is well known that in o - minimal geometry , definable sets that are locally closed are easier to handle than arbitrary definable sets .",
    "a typical example of this phenomenon can be seen in the well - studied problem of obtaining tight upper bounds on topological invariants such as the betti numbers of semi - algebraic or semi - pfaffian sets in terms of the complexity of formulae defining them .",
    "certain standard techniques from algebraic topology ( for example , inequalities stemming from the mayer - vietoris exact sequence ) are directly applicable only in the case of locally closed definable sets .",
    "definable sets which are not locally closed are comparatively more difficult to analyze . in order to overcome",
    "this difficulty , gabrielov and vorobjov in their paper @xcite suggested a construction which , given a definable set @xmath1 in an o - minimal extension of the reals , produced an explicit family of definable compact sets converging to @xmath1 . under a certain technical condition ( called `` separability '' ) they proved that the approximating compact sets are homotopy equivalent to @xmath1 .",
    "the separability condition is automatically satisfied in many cases of interests  such as when @xmath1 is described by equations and inequalities with continuous definable functions .",
    "however , the property of separability is not preserved under taking images of definable maps , and this restricts the applicability of this construction .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the crucial property of the approximating family ( homotopy equivalence to @xmath1 ) remains true even without the separability hypothesis .",
    "proving this conjecture seems to be a rather difficult problem at present .",
    "one of the authors of the current paper ( gabrielov ) has outlined a research program whose completion would lead ( amongst other things ) to a proof of the conjecture .",
    "the goal of the program is a `` triangulation '' of an increasing definable family of compact sets .",
    "more precisely , the goal is to prove that given any increasing definable family of compact sets converging to a definable set @xmath2 , there exists a definable triangulation of @xmath0 such that inside each open simplex of this triangulation the increasing definable family belongs to a finite list of combinatorial types .",
    "such a triangulation should be considered as being compatible with the given increasing family ( thus generalizing the standard notion of definable triangulations compatible with a given definable set ) .",
    "the homotopy equivalence conjecture will then follow from this triangulation .",
    "one of the key steps in gabrielov s program is to prove the existence of a regular triangulation of the graph of a definable function .",
    "more precisely , there is the following conjecture .",
    "[ con : triang ] let @xmath3 , be a definable function on a compact definable set @xmath4 .",
    "then there exists a definable triangulation of @xmath5 such that , for each @xmath6 and for each open @xmath7-simplex @xmath8 of the triangulation ,    1 .",
    "the graph @xmath9 of the restriction of @xmath10 on @xmath8 is a regular @xmath7-cell ( see definition  [ def : cell ] ) ; 2 .",
    "either @xmath10 is a constant on @xmath8 or each non - empty level set @xmath11 is a regular @xmath12-cell .",
    "it should be pointed out that conjecture  [ con : triang ] does not follow from results in the literature on the existence of definable triangulations adapted to a given finite family of definable subsets of @xmath0 ( such as @xcite ) , since all the proofs use a preparatory linear change of coordinates in order for the given definable sets to be in a good position with respect to coordinate projections .",
    "since we are concerned with the graphs and the level sets of a function , in order to prove conjecture  [ con : triang ] we are not allowed to make any change of coordinates which involves the last coordinate .",
    "thus , the standard methods of obtaining a definable triangulation using `` cylindrical decomposition '' are not immediately applicable . in the book @xcite ,",
    "van den dries describes a strong form of cylindrical decomposition in which the cells are defined by functions having coordinate - wise monotonicity property ( such cells are called regular in @xcite ) .",
    "we show that in fact these cells are not necessarily regular cells in the sense of topology ( see definition  [ def : cell ] ) . to prove conjecture  [ con : triang ] , we need a sufficiently general class of definable sets which are guaranteed to be topologically regular cells .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new class of definable sets , which we call semi - monotone sets , and show that an open definable semi - monotone set in @xmath0 is a regular @xmath7-cell .",
    "a coordinate cone in @xmath0 is an intersection of some coordinate hyperplanes and open coordinate half - spaces .",
    "a semi - monotone set is a definable in an o - minimal structure over the reals , open bounded subset of @xmath0 such that its intersection with any translation of any coordinate cone is connected .",
    "it is obvious that every convex definable bounded open set is semi - monotone .",
    "some non - convex examples as well as counter - examples are shown in figure  [ fig : examplesandcounterexamples ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : definitions ] we define a semi - monotone set and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for an open bounded set to be semi - monotone , which are similar to the properties of cylindrical cells in o - minimal geometry . in particular , it is proved that any semi - monotone set is a `` band '' between the graphs of two semi - continuous functions which are defined on a semi - monotone set of a smaller dimension and satisfy certain monotonicity properties .    section  [ sec : regular ] contains the proof of the main result , that every semi - monotone set is a regular cell . in section",
    "[ sec : real - closed ] we prove the regularity in the case of semi - algebraic semi - monotone sets defined over an arbitrary real closed field . in section  [ sec : vdd ] we show that cylindrical cells called `` regular '' in @xcite are not necessarily topologically regular .    in section  [ sec : boolean ] a concept of a regular boolean function is introduced .",
