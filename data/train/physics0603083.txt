    "where weather is concerned , attempts at its prediction @xcite and its apparent unpredictability have always intrigued the human mind .",
    "related phenomena such as storms , floods and droughts , as well as global weather and issues of climate prediction such as the green - house - gas effect and global warming regularly appear in news bulletins and tv programs worldwide @xcite .",
    "thus weather is where many of us get our first exposure to science and in particular science s attempts at predicting natural behavior of highly complex systems .",
    "however , precisely because of this complexity , inexperienced science enthusiasts rarely have the tools needed to engage in predicting atmospheric behavior .",
    "one particular example of a natural atmospheric phenomenon which continues to attract regular public attention is the so - called el nio event in the equatorial pacific , which occurs irregularly at intervals of @xmath0@xmath1 years with occasionally dramatic consequences for many regions worldwide .",
    "these `` teleconnections '' can be observed in many places , for example spring rainfall levels in central europe , flooding in east africa , and the ferocity of the hurricane season in the gulf of mexico @xcite .",
    "predictions of when and where el nio weather patterns will dominate local weather conditions are very hard to obtain . usually , so - called coupled atmosphere - ocean general circulation models ( cgcms ) , combined with large scale computing resources are needed to study and predict el nio s consequences @xcite .",
    "clearly , such resources will normally be beyond the reach of teachers and even lecturers at university .",
    "consequently , student projects on the el nio phenomenon which involve a substantial _ quantitative _ component are rare",
    ".    fortunately , a route towards qualitative _ and _ quantitative prediction exists .",
    "this approach is based on the _ delayed - action oscillator _",
    "( dao ) , a one - dimensional , non - linear ordinary differential equation with delay term which was introduced in 1988 by suarez and schopf @xcite .",
    "the dao models the irregular fluctuations of the sea - surface temperature ( sst ) , incorporating the full coupled navier - stokes dynamics of the el nio event via a suitably chosen non - linearity .",
    "while previous studies of the model have concentrated on the universal properties of the dimensionless dynamics @xcite , we shall show in the present paper how to use the dao to predict many of the essential features of el nio events .",
    "we shall extend the model to quantitatively include the effects of the annual cycle , global warming , randomness in temperature conditions and the possible influence of the dynamics outside the equator .",
    "we believe that this discussion of the dao opens up various avenues for student projects , be it at the high school or undergraduate level .",
    "important underlying physics and meteorology concepts such as ocean waves and their speeds , non - linear dynamics , the coriolis force , convective cycles of ocean and atmosphere currents , global wind patterns and their stability can be discussed and help the students understand that el nio  far from only being a bringer of doom as sometimes portrayed in the media  is in fact a natural consequence of our planet s celestial dynamics @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - enso ] ,",
    "we review the el nio - southern oscillation phenomenon .",
    "section [ sec - dao ] introduces the basic dao model and we study its basic dynamics .",
    "sections [ sec - annualforcing ] , [ sec - globalwarming ] and [ sec - randomeffects ] investigate the influences of annual forcing , global warming and random effects on the dao , with section [ sec - allinone ] incorporating all these processes .",
    "section [ sec - coupleddaos ] then extends that single dao to more than one coupled dao .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "information on the numerical methods and an example code can be found in the appendix .",
    "the term el nio was originally used , from as early as the late 19th century @xcite , in reference to an observed warm southward flowing current that moderates the low sst along the west coast of peru and ecuador @xcite .",
    "this current arrives after christmas , during the early months of the calendar year , and was therefore named `` el nio '' ( the `` little boy '' or christ child in spanish ) . in certain years this current would be unusually strong , bringing heavy rains and flooding inland , but also decimating fishing stocks , bird populations and other water - based wildlife in what would normally be an abundant part of the pacific .    today ,",
    "the term el nio is most often used when describing a far larger - scale warm event that can be observed across the whole of the pacific ocean by certain characteristic climatic conditions .",
    "el nio is just one phase of the so - called el nio - southern oscillation ( enso ) phenomenon , i.e.  an irregular cycle of coupled ocean temperature and atmospheric pressure oscillations across the whole equatorial pacific . in fig .",
    "[ fig - sstoscillations ] , we show the measured sst as well as the average annual cycle .    .",

    "[ fig - enso - geometry ] ) with the sst anomaly ( solid black , left axis ) .",
    "el nio events are denoted by a black square above the event , la nia events ( see section [ sec - lanina ] ) by a black circle below . ]",
    "since 1899 , there have been @xmath4 recorded el nio events , giving an average period for enso of @xmath5 years @xcite",
    ". however , there is evidence to suggest that el nio events are becoming stronger and more frequent ; there have been @xmath6 events in the last @xmath7 yrs ( an average period of @xmath8 years ) , @xmath0 of which were the strongest of the century @xcite .      in order to understand the el nio anomaly ,",
    "let us first describe the normal conditions that exist in the pacific ocean between @xmath9 east and @xmath10 west . in fig.[fig - enso - geometry ]",
    "we show a schematic view of the relevant section of the pacific .",
    "( right hashed rectangle ) , @xmath11 ( left hashed rectangle ) and @xmath3 ( rectangle with dashed line borders ) .",
    "the thermocline height in normal ( solid ) and el nio conditions ( dashed line ) is indicated schematically in the diagram . ]    in normal conditions , the trade winds blow from east to west across the tropical pacific , resulting in warm surface water being pushed west , so that the thermocline  a region of water roughly @xmath12 m below the surface where there is a very sharp temperature gradient separating the warm surface layer from the cold abyss  is depressed further in the west , and made shallower in the east @xcite .",
    "the sst is about @xmath13c higher in the west , with cool temperatures off south america , due to cold water upwelling , i.e.  rising from the deeper layer to the surface @xcite .",
    "this cold nutrient - rich water supports diverse marine ecosystems and major fisheries , so upwelling is of immense ecological and economic importance to the west coast of the americas @xcite .",
    "the warmer sst in the west means increased evaporation and rising moist air , and hence high levels of rainfall ( a tropical climate ) , along with low atmospheric sea - level pressures in the west . in the east , the colder sst results in far less rainfall , an arid inland climate and higher atmospheric sea - level pressures .",
    "this induced pressure difference drives the circulation of the trade winds .",
    "a measure of the strength of the trade winds is the southern oscillation index ( soi ) , defined as the normalized difference in sea - level pressures between tahiti and darwin , australia .",
    "the whole process is a therefore a self - sustaining cycle ; winds cause thermocline and sst changes , which cause pressure differences , which in turn drive the winds .      during an el nio event",
    "the sst and soi change dramatically . in the central and western pacific ,",
    "there is relaxation in the strength of the trade winds .",
    "this leads to a depression of the thermocline in the east and an elevation in the west , because less warm water is being pushed west .",
    "this increase in thermocline depth in the east can be as large as a factor of three , leading to an increase in sst , and the effective cut - off of upwelling of nutrients to the surface .",
    "this has devastating consequences for the primary producers ( such as plankton ) in the food chain , with knock - on effects for other life , such as fish and birdlife @xcite .",
    "the increased sst in the east also leads to an increased evaporation , and large amounts of rain , often causing extensive flooding .",
    "the rising air decreases the normally high pressure . during large el nio events",
    "the soi is very negative , indicating a reversal in trade winds .",
    "this causes a great deal of warm , moist air ( and hence rain ) to move east , whilst leaving a severe drought in the western pacific , often resulting in large bush fires .",
    "la nia ( the `` little girl '' ) is the phase of the enso cycle which is opposite to el nio .",
    "it is characterized by unusually _",
    "cold _ ocean temperatures in the central and eastern pacific .",
    "la nia arises by a strengthening in the trade winds , further depressing the thermocline in the west ( and elevating it in the east ) , which increases cold water upwelling in the eastern pacific .",
    "this lower sst means the high levels of nutrients can support an abundance of life in the ocean .",
    "the soi is also positive ( increased pressure difference ) , bringing enhanced rainfall in the west .",
    "the dao is a simple non - linear model in which the enso effect is modeled by just three terms @xcite . with @xmath14 denoting the temperature _ anomaly _ ,",
    "i.e.  the deviation from a suitably defined long term average temperature , the model is given as a first - order , non - linear differential equation @xmath15 with appropriate coupling constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the first term on the right hand side in ( [ eq - dao ] ) represents a strong _ positive _ feedback within a coupled ocean - atmosphere system which is assumed to occur in the nio @xmath3 region . a much deeper thermocline as in the west , or a cold sst as in the east , would result in much poorer feedback coupling .",
    "the feedback process works through advective processes giving rise to temperature perturbations which in turn result in atmospheric heating .",
    "this heating leads to surface winds , driving the ocean currents which will then enhance the anomaly @xmath14 .",
    "the second component is an unspecified nonlinear net _ damping _ term that is present in order to limit the growth of unstable perturbations .",
    "this term represents various ocean advective processes and moist processes that stop temperatures diverging .",
    "lastly , the model also considers _ equatorially - trapped _",
    "ocean waves propagating across the pacific , before interacting back with the central pacific region after a certain time delay .",
    "these ocean waves are `` hidden '' rossby waves which move westward on the thermocline , reflect off the rigid continental boundary in the west and then return eastward along the equator as kelvin waves .",
    "their respective wave velocities and the width of the pacific basin determine the transit time , which is denoted @xmath19 in eq.([eq - dao ] ) .",
    "the strength of the returning , emerging signals relative to that of the local non - delayed feedback is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath20 due to loss of information during transit and imperfect reflection .",
    "we shall often use the dao in its dimensionless form @xmath21 where we have scaled time by @xmath22 and temperature by @xmath23 .",
    "the new constants then are @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in what follows ,",
    "we shall for simplicity suppress the prime in all expressions where there is no ambiguity .",
    "the dao delay term has a negative coefficient representing a negative feedback . to see the reason for this ,",
    "let us consider a warm sst perturbation in the coupled region .",
    "this produces a westerly wind response that deepens the thermocline locally ( immediate positive feedback ) , but at the same time , the wind perturbations produce _ divergent _ westward propagating rossby waves that return after time @xmath19 to create upwelling and cooling , reducing the original perturbation .",
    "this process can therefore be seen as a phase - reversing reflection off the coupled region ; the resultant upwelling will cause further rossby wave propagation , which in turn will cause downwelling and warming after a further delay , @xmath19 .",
    "hence we expect the period of model oscillations to be no less that @xmath26  `` period doubling '' @xcite .",
    "note that the eastern boundary will also contribute a delay term to the dao , however equatorial kelvin wave reflection from eastern boundaries is weak as the bulk of the wave propagates _ along _ the coast @xcite .",
    "for this reason we may ignore these effects .",
    "it is possible to estimate the wave transit times , and hence the time delay @xmath19 of the dao model , from knowledge of the wave speeds for rossby and kelvin waves ( see appendix [ sec - shallowwaterwaves ] ) .",
    "we shall return to this direct comparison later , but for now we focus on the behavior of the dimensionless dao ( [ eq - daodimless ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq - daodimless ] ) can not be solved analytically .",
    "but we may study its dynamics by analyzing its behavior close the its fixed points , i.e.  those special solutions @xmath27 of ( [ eq - daodimless ] ) for which @xmath28 which also immediately implies @xmath29 for all @xmath30 . hence we need to solve @xmath31 and so the fixed point solutions are @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the trivial fixed point , corresponding to a zero temperature anomaly .",
    "it is also unstable , i.e.  any small perturbation will lead to a system moving away from @xmath34 .",
    "therefore we shall concentrate on the other two fixed points @xmath35 . due to symmetry",
    ", it is furthermore sufficient to consider one of these only and we choose @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamics close to @xmath37 can be examined by a linear stability analysis .",
    "let us consider a small perturbation @xmath38 .",
    "ignoring terms of more than linear order in @xmath39 @xcite , we find when substituting @xmath39 back into @xmath40 that @xmath41 we now look for solutions of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a constant real number equal the initial condition @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a complex number .",
    "substituting this in ( [ eq - lineardao ] ) gives an equation for @xmath45 @xmath46 writing @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are both real , we find    @xmath49    when @xmath50 , the solution @xmath51 is purely oscillatory and hence the fixed point is a _",
    " neither stable nor unstable  with a finite frequency of @xmath52 .",
    "these _ neutral _ solutions occur along ( an infinite number of ) neutral curves of the form : @xmath53    in figure [ fig - neutralcurves ] , we show the @xmath54 phase diagram of the dao obtained from the linear stability analysis .    .",
    "neutral curves for @xmath55 ( solid line ) and @xmath56 ( dashed line ) are shown together with stable ( grey ) and unstable regions ( white ) . ]",
    "only @xmath57 is plotted , since for this domain the coefficient on the local term in @xmath58 is always smaller than that of the delayed term .",
    "if it were larger , then the local term would always dominate , and the solution would always be stable , i.e.  for @xmath59 the fixed point is always stable and attracting , regardless of the initial conditions .",
    "choosing ( @xmath60 ) below the first neutral curve , e.g.within the shaded region of figure [ fig - neutralcurves ] , corresponds to @xmath61 and hence the solution is a decaying spiral  the fixed point is stable and attractive .",
    "however , taking ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) above this neutral curve gives @xmath64 , and so the perturbation spiral grows outwards  the fixed point is unstable and no matter how close to @xmath65 the solution starts , it will always move away .",
    "if ( @xmath60 ) is taken above the second neutral curve , the fixed point is still unstable @xmath66 but the number of unstable modes has increased to two .",
    "however , the basic dao equation ( [ eq - daodimless ] ) is only a one - dimensional problem , as there is only one variable @xmath14 , and so the extra unstable modes do not influence the dynamics .",
    "this linear stability approach is highly useful , given that it depends on only two parameters , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and reveals valuable information about the stabilities of the fixed points . given an @xmath62 and a @xmath63 , it also provides a solution to the dao given by : @xmath67 which is perfectly valid to within an order of @xmath68 , provided it stays close to @xmath37 .",

    ", we see that the numerical solution and the linear approximation are in good agreement and quickly converge to the stable fixed point @xmath76 as expected for @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - basicsolutions](b ) , we are still close to the neutral curve but have already crossed over into the unstable regime .",
    "consequently , the numerical solution starts to slowly spiral away from @xmath76 , becoming large enough so that the dynamics are also influenced by the second unstable fixed point at @xmath81 , resulting in the onset of oscillations between them .",
    "this is shown in more detail in fig.[fig - phaseportrait](b ) .",
    "the agreement with the numerical solution clearly breaks down very quickly , since the linear stability analysis shows an unstable spiral , which continues to only grow about @xmath37 .    at an even larger @xmath63 value ,",
    "we see in fig.[fig - basicsolutions](c ) that the numerical solution immediately diverges from the fixed point and goes to an oscillatory state , the amplitude of which is limited by the nonlinear damping term in eq.([eq - daodimless ] ) .",
    "the behavior for other values of @xmath62 is analogous .",
    "therefore , we have identified within the dao model ( [ eq - daodimless ] ) a whole region of @xmath62 and @xmath63 values where we obtain oscillations of the sst anomaly between a hot ( @xmath82 ) and a cold ( @xmath83 ) fixed point .",
    "this feature is what makes the dao a model for oscillations between hot el nio and cold la nia conditions .",
    "as identified in the last section , the dao model is capable of producing limit cycle oscillations for a wide region of ( @xmath84 ) values .",
    "we next compute the period of these oscillations and compare them to those observed for typical enso cycles .    as shown in figure [ fig - enso - geometry ] , the nio @xmath3 region extends from @xmath9 west to @xmath85 west , with the midpoint at @xmath86 west .",
    "if we assume that the pacific western boundary is at @xmath87 east , this gives an angular separation of @xmath88 of longitude for the waves to travel .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath89 m , where the radius of the earth @xmath90 m . using the values of @xmath91ms@xmath92 for a kelvin wave and @xmath93ms@xmath92 for the primary rossby mode as obtained in appendix [ sec - shallowwaterwaves ]",
    "thus gives a delay of @xmath94 days for the rossby propagation to the western boundary , and a further @xmath95 days for the return of the kelvin waves , a total delay of @xmath96 days .",

    ", we have seen that the dao is a useful tool in studying the enso cycle .",
    "the main beauty of the dao ( [ eq - dao ] ) is its simplicity .",
    "although the full equation can not be solved explicitly , the linear stability analysis and the numerical solutions both give highly useful insights .",
    "in particular , the numerical solutions exhibit the true global dynamics of the dao .",
    "there are limit cycle oscillations , with a period that matches the real world , and hence the dao is a good model for these features of enso .",
    "nevertheless , the dao model assumes a localized coupled problem , which is obviously an over - simplification of the situation in the pacific .",
    "all influences of the atmosphere , the earth s rotation , and the ocean currents and dynamics are simply modeled by a non - linear , effective damping term and a somewhat arbitrary delay .",
    "the delay term ignores , e.g.  east boundary reflections that could possibly be considered .",
    "the model further assumes that time scales must be related to propagation times of equatorially trapped oceanic waves in a closed basin . for the atmosphere , which has short time scales , the dao simply assumes an _ instantaneous _ response .",
    "in this and the following sections , we shall extend the basic dao discussed above by including external influences which allow us to model the enso dynamics better . in order to distinguish",
    "this extended dao from its original , we shall denote the new model as enso - dao from now on .      as mentioned above",
    ", an el nio event typically appears in late december , early january .",
    "thus the annual cycle is clearly playing an important role in determining the onset of el nio @xcite .",

    "interpolating function , @xmath104 , representing the continuous changes of the average sst during the year .",

    "[ fig - annualdao ] , and should be compared to fig .",
    "[ fig - sstoscillations ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig - annualdao ] it is clear that the addition of an annual forcing term has changed the dynamics in several ways .",
    "firstly , the peak amplitude of the oscillations has been increased .",
    "the peaks themselves are less regular because of the quickly changing forcing term provided by the seasons .",
    "however , the paramount effect of the annual cycle is in determining the onset and period of an el nio event .",
    "hot events only occur _ in - phase _ with the annual cycle , and hence the enso - dao now has an exact integer period , e.g.  3 years for our model .",
    "the enso - dao gives high temperatures from july through to march of the next year  which is indeed as observed in the pacific  with the maximum amplitude usually in december .",
    "global warming is another effect that may influence the periodicity and amplitude of enso events . for the purpose of this paper",
    "it will be modeled via a constant heating on the pacific dao system .",
    "working with the dimensionless dao for simplicity , this is achieved by adding a constant @xmath121 to the dao equation ( [ eq - daodimless ] ) giving : @xmath122 on its own , this term would give @xmath123 , solved by @xmath124 , a linear warming with time .",
    "we shall consider @xmath125 , a constant heating , although @xmath126 cooling can be treated completely analogously .",
    "current climate change models predict the rise in average global temperature over the next @xmath12 years will be below @xmath127c @xcite , hence we chose this scenario to be used in our enso - dao . using the standard model of section [ sec - annualforcing ] , this gives @xmath128 as the value of @xmath121 in eq .",

    "consider a basic dao system ( above the solid black neutral curve in figure [ fig - neutralcurves ] ) that has an unstable fixed point @xmath136 with limit cycle oscillations . by introducing @xmath125 ,",
    "the neutral curve is shifted to the right , and hence the additional ( hashed ) stable region in fig.[fig - modneutralcurves ] is created , changing the dao dynamics .",
    "as @xmath121 increases , the model fluctuates for longer about the unstable @xmath133 before flipping out to oscillate around both fixed points .",
    "eventually , the dashed neutral curve in fig .  [ fig - modneutralcurves ] moves to the right of ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath133 becomes attracting .",
    "this stability bifurcation occurs at @xmath137 , which can be found for any given ( @xmath138 ) by solving eq.([eq - betaneutralcurve ] ) for @xmath121 .",
    "if enough heating were applied to the dao , the enso cycle would be terminated , leaving an ocean at a constant temperature and with no el nio events .",
    "however , for slow heating , such as @xmath139 , there is very little change to the time dependence of the dao with respect to sst anomaly amplitudes or their periodicity except for a small subset of solutions .",
    "this would suggest that global warming will not affect enso , and hence el nio events will still continue to occur .",
    "chaos inherent in real world weather systems plays an important part in the irregularity of el nio events .",
    "processes such as storms , cyclones and ocean currents which traverse the pacific play no part in our enso model , but will influence the system for their duration in the nio @xmath3 region .",
    "we therefore consider the addition of a general stochastic term @xcite @xmath140 to the dimensional dao equation ( [ eq - dao ] ) giving : @xmath141 @xmath140 is a step function that takes fixed , normally distributed ( mean @xmath34 , standard deviation @xmath142 ) , random values for each monthly time - step .",
    "a ( non - enso ) event that lasts for longer than one month is unphysical , and shorter - lived events will not have time to cause any significant differences ( their randomness is averaged out ) .    another way of viewing @xmath140 is as a @xmath121 heating / cooling that only lasts for one month .",
    "this will mean that the neutral curves given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - betaneutralcurve ] ) will shift right / left each month , due to the fixed points @xmath143 changing position .",
    "if @xmath142 is small , then there is hardly any change to the basic dao .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath142 , the fixed points can change their stabilities each month , inducing a great deal of random behavior in the dao .",
    "for example , the system may be stable and tending towards @xmath144 of that month , and then @xmath140 changes to produce an unstable system that wants to oscillate .",
    "this creates many different el nio events with differing amplitudes and durations , as well as the possibility of times where the system stays near zero .",
    "we now combine of all of the effects considered above , namely the annual cycle , global warming and stochastic effects .",
    "therefore the dao equation ( [ eq - dao ] ) becomes @xmath145 using the standard model of section [ sec - annualforcing ] , with @xmath146years as the fully dimensional global warming factor and @xmath140 with @xmath147 , the dao produces very realistic pictures , such as fig .",

    "most obvious are the small fluctuations associated with the stochastic effects . in addition , the regularity of the original dao oscillations is broken and sometimes a complete enso event has vanished . e.g.  the absence of the sst peaks at about @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ fig - allinone ] .",
    "this happens when the onset of the enso cycle event takes place at a time when the random forcing happens to change the sst into the opposite direction .",
    "we emphasize that a variety of solution curves similar to fig .",
    "[ fig - allinone ] can be generated by taking other ( @xmath138 ) combinations , initial sst values and stochastic forcing .",
    "the basic dao model ( [ eq - dao ] ) considers a single , but representative region with strong atmospheric - ocean coupling in the pacific .",
    "clearly , we might also want to consider situations in which other regions of the pacific are incorporated",
    ". these could be either other regions along the equator , where we would expect differing coupling strengths and delay times . or they could be regions to the north and south of the central dao region in which no delay and only weak coupling exists , such that these additional regions act as temperature sinks .",
    "possible arrangements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - coupledregions ] . in this chapter",
    ", we will consider one such prototype situation , namely two coupled regions along the equator .     and @xmath0 and potential north ",
    "south regions ( hashed ) .",
    "the equator is indicated as a horizontal dashed line . ]",
    "let us for simplicity assume that coupling @xmath62 and delay @xmath63 in the two regions are the same .",
    "this is a valid assumption as long as the two adjacent regions are both in the strong - coupling region such that the distance to the western boundary is approximately the same , with the same losses and reflection properties .",
    "if one region is warmer than the other , then the flow of heat energy across their common boundary will act to heat one and cool the other .",
    "this can be modeled by incorporating a @xmath149 term in each dao with @xmath150 and @xmath151 the anomaly in the adjacent dao region .",
    "then we have a system of @xmath0 coupled daos such that    [ eq - daocoupled ] @xmath152    the fixed point solutions can be found as before by taking @xmath153 and substituting ( [ eq - region1 ] ) into ( [ eq - region2 ] ) .",
    "this yields a @xmath154th order polynomial in @xmath155 with a mixture of real and complex roots which vary as a function of @xmath156 .",
    "the solutions @xmath157 are the same in both regions and are always real since @xmath158 , and hence are of most interest .    conducting a linear stability analysis about the fixed points ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) as in section [ sec - dao - linearstability ]",
    ", we find neutral curves given by @xmath161 the first neutral curve is shown in figure [ fig - modneutralcurves ] for an example with @xmath162 .",
    "we see that similar to section [ sec - globalwarming ] , the neutral curves move right with increasing @xmath156 , such that the fixed point can bifurcate from unstable to stable .",
    "so , if there is strong coupling between regions in the pacific ( large @xmath156 ) , then independent oscillations can not occur and the system settles down to constant temperature anomalies .",
    "however , for sufficiently weak coupling , enso - style oscillations are still permitted .    as before ,",
    "we have also solved the eq .",
    "( [ eq - daocoupled ] ) numerically .",
    "depending on the initial sst anomalies , we find that we can drive the regions into ( i ) stable , non - oscillatory solutions , ( ii ) in - phase oscillations and even ( iii ) oscillations which are out - of - phase by @xmath163 . for brevity , we do not show the results here .",
    "let us now consider briefly the situation in which @xmath164 or @xmath165 are different in the different regions . if @xmath166 represents the anomaly in region @xmath0 of fig .",
    "[ fig - coupledregions ] and @xmath167 the anomaly in region @xmath168 , then the wave transit time from @xmath167 to the western boundary would be greater than that from @xmath166 .",
    "similarly , the strength of the returning signal to @xmath167 would be less than that to @xmath166 , as more information would be lost due to the greater distance across which information is transported .",
    "however , the waves propagating from @xmath167 are not hidden from the problem whilst they are propagating through @xmath166 , suggesting that @xmath63 could be the same for both regions , namely the propagation time from @xmath166 to the western boundary and back .",
    "similarly , the strength of the local coupling is assumed to be less in @xmath167 , suggesting that even though the strength of the returning signal is less , relative to the local coupling its affect would be the same as in @xmath166 .",
    "figure [ fig - differentalpha ] shows how the coupled model ( [ eq - daocoupled ] ) is affected by different values of @xmath62 .    ) , with @xmath169 in region @xmath168 , @xmath170 in region @xmath0 , @xmath71 in both regions and @xmath171 . ]    in the figure we see that @xmath167 shows some irregular behavior with varying amplitudes .",
    "this behavior is more like that of el nio than the simple dao .",
    "other possible coupled dao scenarios could include @xmath172 coupled regions , either along the equator or aligned along a south - north axis .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that such models gives rise to irregular enso cycles as above",
    ". however , the models have to be treated with proper care , since some solutions become unphysical , e.g.  indicating uninterrupted heating or cooling of the ocean .",
    "the dao is given by a simple one - dimensional differential equation , and may nowadays be studied by readily available desk- or laptop computing facilities . yet it captures much of the observed richness and variance of the enso phenomenon .",
    "we are therefore convinced that it presents an ideal tool to introduce students to the topic .",
    "let us briefly recapitulate what issues we have been able to study in the present paper using the dao .",
    "we first outline the linear stability analysis and the numerical solution of the dao that were the content of the first paper on the dao @xcite .",
    "this then serves to introduce the concept of shallow - water kelvin and rossby waves , as well as to establish our notation .",
    "using the corresponding wave speeds and the geography of the pacific , we can already show that for a large set of parameters , the observed enso periodicity can be modeled by the dao .",
    "next , the inclusion of the measured annual cycle demonstrates that the observed enso - dao periodicity may in fact be heavily influenced by the earth s period around the sun .",
    "the occurrence of an enso event is very much subject to the right season and thus the original dao period need not be identical to the observed enso - dao period .",
    "we stress that the modeling of the annual cycle within the dao is quite easy and should not be beyond any student who has mastered the original dao .",
    "we then extended the dao to include a constant heating  global warming  and found that current predictions of @xmath127c rise over @xmath12 years are unlikely to influence the enso - dao dynamics .",
    "we also do not find any large increase in either occurrence or magnitude of enso events .",
    "this seems to be at variance with current predictions based on cgcms @xcite and might just indicate the limitations of the enso - dao model for true , quantitative predictions .",
    "putting it all together , we then included a certain level of stochastic forcing alongside the annual cycle , and found that the enso - dao dynamics now become very much like the observed enso dynamics , showing a large variation in oscillation periods and amplitudes . at least on a qualitative level ",
    "the range of the sst oscillations is in fact even quantitatively similar  which shows the strength of the enso - dao .    finally , we briefly discussed some extensions of the enso - dao model , such as coupled regions .",
    "the example of the @xmath0-coupled - regions model shows that the extended daos share some irregularities with the observed enso phenomenon already , even in the absence of annual or stochastic forcing .",
    "further investigations of enso - dao might include an analysis of the statistical properties of the measured enso cycles as in fig.[fig - allinone ] and comparisons with observed data , a more thorough analysis of the possible changes in periodicity and strengths of enso - dao oscillations due to human influences , a mathematical analysis of the dao for integer periods or even an application to the atlantic .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that the dao  while being a research tool in its own right @xcite  can be investigated by modest analytical and computational resources .",
    "we think that it will be an ideal topic for all students , teachers and lecturers interested in the exciting dynamics of the el nio phenomenon and hope that the present paper will help them in this quest .",
    "the present paper has grown from a final year student project at the university of warwick supervised by one of us ( rar ) .",
    "we thankfully acknowledge discussions and careful reading of the manuscript by g.king and g.  rowlands . we thank c.  sohrmann for help with fig.[fig - daoperiods ] .",
    "oceans are warmer near the surface than they are in the deep , and due to thermal expansion this warm layer will have a lower density .",
    "thus a simple model for the ocean structure is a two - fluid model with density @xmath173 in the warm surface layer and density @xmath174 below in the cold abyss .",
    "the dividing zone is called the _ thermocline_. at its widest ,",
    "the pacific is @xmath175 km across from the malay peninsula to panama whilst only having an average depth of @xmath176 m . so the pacific is roughly @xmath172 orders of magnitude wider than it is deep , and so we are justified in rewriting the original navier - stokes equations using the _ shallow - water approximation _ @xcite .",
    "these are given as    [ eq - shallowwater ] @xmath177    in the absence of external forces . here",
    "@xmath178 is the displacement velocity in the cartesian frame @xmath179 and @xmath180 is a small perturbation to the constant mean thermocline depth @xmath181 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath182 is the coriolis parameter and @xmath183 is the effective gravitational acceleration .",
    "equations ( [ eq - shallowwater ] ) permit two types of thermocline wave solutions .",
    "the first are inertia - gravity _ kelvin _ waves .",
    "the second type are planetary _ rossby _ waves .",
    "equatorially trapped kelvin waves have no meridional ( @xmath184 ) velocity fluctuations such that the shallow water equations ( [ eq - shallowwater ] ) can be simplified to    @xmath185    @xmath186    equation ( [ eq - kelvinx ] ) implies that solutions have to be of the form @xmath187 with wave speed @xmath188 .",
    "in addition , eq .  ( [ eq - kelviny ] ) prohibits westward propagation ( @xmath189 ) since those solutions become unbounded at large @xmath184 . therefore only eastward ,",
    "equatorially trapped ( @xmath190 ) , kelvin waves are possible .",
    "these non - dispersive thermocline gravity waves propagate eastward with speed @xmath191ms@xmath92 , when assuming a height @xmath192 m and @xmath193 @xcite for the two - fluid model.m had been assumed throughout , then @xmath194ms@xmath92 .",
    "this tsunami - like speed is clearly absurd for the purposes of this project , hence the need for the more sophisticated two - fluid model . ]",
    "rossby waves owe their existence to the variation of the coriolis parameter with latitude .",
    "close to the equator the coriolis parameter is given by @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the radius of the earth and @xmath197 the earth s angular velocity .",
    "if we consider a linearized version of the shallow - water equations and seek solutions for latitudinal waves of the form @xmath198 , with @xmath199 and the sign of @xmath16 determining the direction of zonal ( @xmath200 ) phase propagation , we obtain their wave equation as @xmath201 with @xmath202 and @xmath203 . from ( [ eq - rossby ] )",
    "we see that solutions are wavelike within an _ equatorial waveguide _ of width @xmath204 , and decay exponentially for latitudes greater than @xmath205 .",
    "if we now assume that the latitudinal dependance of @xmath206 is of plane - wave type @xmath207 , then for these equatorially trapped waves we have @xmath208 as the only allowed standing wave solutions .",
    "a dispersion relation can be extracted from ( [ eq - rossby ] ) and at low frequencies @xmath209 with wavelength @xmath210 . since @xmath16 must therefore be negative , all rossby waves have westward phase propagation . the slow , short ,",
    "dispersive waves have eastward group velocities and the fast , long , non - dispersive waves have westward group velocities of @xmath211 .",
    "only the long waves are important in the oceanic adjustment to changes in surface winds  a process that is crucial in ocean - atmosphere coupled systems  so only westward propagating rossby waves will usually be considered .",
