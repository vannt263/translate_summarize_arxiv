    "modern ring lasers gyroscopes ( rl ) based on the sagnac effect are standard inertial sensors of rotation rates with many applications , ranging form inertial guidance @xcite , to angle metrology @xcite , geodesy @xcite , and geophysics @xcite . their application to general relativity tests has also been recently considered @xcite as in the ginger proposal ( gyroscopes in general relativity ) , an underground experiment on the detection of the dragging of the inertial frame ( lense - thirring effect ) due to the earth rotation .",
    "a ring laser `` gyro '' consists of two counter propagating electromagnetic waves along a polygonal closed path that acts as a resonant cavity .",
    "the theory of sagnac effect predicts that the resonance frequencies for the two counter - propagating modes inside a ring laser cavity , rotating with respect to an inertial frame , differ by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the wavelength of the laser beam , @xmath4 is the projection of the angular velocity of the cavity @xmath5 ( relative to an inertial frame ) on the normal vector @xmath6 of the plane of the ring cavity , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are its area and perimeter , respectively .",
    "laser non - linearities , cavity non - reciprocities , and back - scattering of light on cavity mirrors , require the application of some corrections to the ideal case of eq.([eq : stmodel1 ] ) and we have to generalize it with the effective formula @xcite    @xmath9    where @xmath10 gives the null shift error from the zero value of @xmath11 , @xmath12 accounts for the non - linear contributions from laser dynamics and two beams coupling , and @xmath13 represents the scale factor modifications produced by fluctuations of temperature , pressure and gain of the plasma , as well as by fluctuations of losses , and laser frequency .",
    "an exhaustive treatment of gas lasers phenomena is given by e. lamb in ref .",
    "he described the coupling between the laser beams and the atomic polarization at the third - order expansion in the interaction field , introducing a system of differential equations ruled by a set of parameters known in the following literature as  lamb parameters \" .",
    "the accurate knowledge of scale factor and null shift is particularly required in tests of fundamental physics with rls , e.g. the local lorentz invariance , axion detection , frame dragging , etc . @xcite .",
    "the motivation for our work is to foresee a calibration procedure for large ring lasers that exploits the non - linearity of laser active medium without the need for rotating the apparatus through a calibrated angle .",
    "the possibility of performing a calibration without knowing the input signal is a typical feature of non - linear systems with non - homogeneous input - output relations . with the separation of the identification of cavity losses and active medium parameters we have , on the one hand , that we can increase the time stability of a rl with kalman filtering by subtracting the backscattering . on the other hand , with the characterization of laser active medium ( single",
    "pass gain and plasma dispersion function ) , we can achieve a good accuracy of the rotation estimate . in this respect ,",
    "we already developed @xcite an algorithm for the identification of the lamb parameters for excess gain minus losses @xmath14 backscattering amplitude @xmath15 and phases @xmath16 , that are associated with cavity dissipation . after providing a raw estimate of the laser medium gain , we run an extended kalman filter that is able to remove a fraction of the backscattering induced drift from the earth rotation rate measurements .",
    "thus we improved the long term stability of the ring g - pisa @xcite and demonstrated the effectiveness of non - linear kalman filtering in removing backscattering effects . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous analysis by presenting a novel identification and calibration procedure for estimating the full set of lamb parameters , i.e. @xmath14 @xmath17 @xmath18 self- and cross- saturation coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and scale factor and null shift errors @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which depend in their turn on cavity losses @xmath23 , plasma polarizability and single pass gain @xmath24 of the laser medium .",

    "to study the rl dynamics we refer to the self - consistent equations derived by aronowitz @xcite starting from lamb s third order expansion of the polarization vector in powers of the electric field amplitude .",

    "conversely , the behaviors of the second kind are limit cycles regimes , characterized by nonzero beat frequency of the the counter - propagating waves ( single mode laser operation ) . when the reciprocal conditions do not hold , the qualitative characteristics of asymptotic time behavior are left unchanged , as a result of the invariance of phase portrait topology under continuous variation of rl parameters .",
    "the rl equations depend on two sets of parameters with distinct physical origin : _ i ) _ cold cavity parameters associated to losses , and _",
    "ii ) _ active medium parameters associated to atomic polarizability . according to this classification , the ring laser matrices can be naturally written as    @xmath63    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the @xmath67-th and @xmath68-nd order contributions to the gas mixture polarizability @xcite    @xmath69    and @xmath70 is the linear coupling matrix associated to cavity losses    @xmath71    here @xmath72 @xmath24 is the laser single pass gain , @xmath23 are the cavity losses , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are functions which depend on the normalized detuning @xmath76 of the optical frequencies to the cavity center frequency , and will be explicitly calculated in the next section . here",
    "we only recall that , in the case of large size rls sensing the earth rotation , we have @xmath77 , and so we can approximate the frequency detuning of each beam with its average @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , cross and self saturation parameters can be assumed equal for the two beams , i.e. @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "as mirror losses of an optical cavity are unpredictable , they must be identified in the rl outputs and tracked in time .",
    "to this aim , we assume for the moment that the first and second order polarizations @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given , and that the light intensities have been already calibrated in lamb units ( see sect .",
    "the identification procedure of cold cavity parameters is based on the existence of a limit cycle that makes it possible to estimate the steady state dynamical losses of a rl system , as asymptotic solutions are periodic with period @xmath84 .",

    "thus , after substituting eqs.([eq:2.8 ] ) into eq.([eq:2.7 ] ) , we can estimate the cavity loss parameters @xmath23 and @xmath15 as    @xmath95    assuming all the other parameters known , the identified cold cavity parameters read    @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the excess gain for zero losses .",

    "@xcite if the cross - saturation parameter @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( doppler limit approximation ) .",
    "as we have already shown , we can improve the long term stability of the estimated sagnac frequency by using extended kalman filters ( ekf ) @xcite .    however , to provide and improve also the accuracy of the sagnac frequency , unbiased estimates of the active medium parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , are required .",
    "unfortunately , the minimization of the functional in eq.([eq:2.7 ] ) is ill - posed for the full set of lamb parameters , and so different approaches for their measurement must be investigated .",
    "theoretical and experimental results of laser plasma physics allow us to estimate the active medium parameters by changing the working point of the system , inducing the  multimode transition \" , and monitoring the plasma fluorescence @xcite .",
    "a rl can be so calibrated as an inertial rotation sensor .",
    "however , to get an order of magnitude of the required accuracy on the active medium parameters given a target precision on the accuracy of the sagnac frequency , we start the analysis of the calibration problem numerically by monte carlo techniques",
    ". then we focus on the description of atomic polarization of the active laser medium and the corresponding experimental measurements .",
    "firstly , we study the bias induced in the estimate of the sagnac frequency by the approximations made in eq.([eq:2.9 ] ) .",

    "we have thoroughly studied the rl dynamics in order to implement identification and calibration methods for the cold cavity and active medium parameters .",
    "the identification method is based on the first harmonic approximation of the steady state solution of rl equations and the minimization of a quadratic functional over the hilbert space of periodic signals . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of a laser with cavity detuning shows many monomode or multimode dynamical behaviors that can be exploited to get rid of systematic errors of sagnac frequency estimation .",
    "the calibration method presented in this paper is based on the measure of the threshold of the multimode transition and the plasma dispersion function .",
    "the systematic errors associated with the latter measurements dominate over statistics errors , as plasma parameters depend also on rf discharge details , e.g. shape of the capillary discharge . however , the accuracy of the identified cold cavity parameters depends on the amount of losses and backscattering of light : higher quality mirrors lead to potentially higher accuracy of the estimated sagnac frequency .",
    "much work has still to be devoted to improve the calibration procedure for the application of rl to fundamental physics .",
    "the problem of pushing calibration and identification methods to their intrinsic accuracy limit , with or without the addition of a calibrated rotation signal to the ring laser input , would deserve further investigation and it will be the topic of a forthcoming paper .",
