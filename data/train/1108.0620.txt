    "the concept of @xmath0symmetry @xcite is an inspiring source of experimental activities in several branches of physics like optics @xcite or solid - state physics @xcite or magnetohydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the idea itself originates in quantum mechanics . in a way illustrated by numerous toy models @xcite",
    "the interest in @xmath1symmetry has been motivated there by a counterintuitive contrast between the manifestly non - hermitian form of a given @xmath1symmetric interaction hamiltonian @xmath2 and the reality of the spectrum of the related energies inside a certain domain @xmath3 of optional parameters .",
    "the mathematical key to the puzzling existence of a non - empty domain @xmath3 of parameters giving real spectra has been found in ref .",
    "the authors emphasized there the compatibility of the non - hermiticity of @xmath4 in a given hilbert space ( say , in @xmath5 where @xmath6 ) with the _ simultaneous _ hermiticity of the same operator in another hilbert space .",
    "in particular , the new space @xmath7 may be allowed to coincide with @xmath8 as a vector space , being just endowed with another , nontrivial , _ ad hoc _ inner product .",
    "the main phenomenological appeal of such a situation lies , paradoxically , in the possibility of a _ loss _ of the reality of the spectrum .",
    "this happens , naturally , at the boundary @xmath9 , i.e. , at a certain value of parameter(s ) called , according to kato @xcite , exceptional point(s ) ( ep ) .",
    "they specify , in effect , the strength of a critical non - hermiticity at which the _ ad hoc _ inner product ceases to exist ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite )    one of the weak points of the recipe ( which the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite could have called  quasi - hermitian quantum mechanics \" , qhqm ) lies in the ambiguity of the definition of the _ ad hoc _ inner product mediated by the so called metric operator @xmath10 ,    @xmath0symmetric quantum mechanics ( ptsqm ) as reviewed in ref .",
    "the essence of ptsqm lies in the introduction of an additional postulate @xmath11 ( called @xmath0symmetry of the hamiltonian for a suitable operator @xmath12 ) and in its combination with another , _ ad hoc _ requirement of factorization @xmath13 where operator @xmath14 is a charge ( cf .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the nontriviality of the _ additional _ requirement of @xmath0symmetry proved more than compensated by its heuristic efficiency , with @xmath15 chosen , most often , as the operator of parity .",
    "a disappointing failure of the extension of the ptsqm formalism to the dynamical regime of scattering @xcite has been discussed in ref .",
    "the obstacle has been found removable via a return to the qhqm recipe , with the emphasis shifted from the charge in @xmath16 to an alternative treatment of the ambiguity of the metric .",
    "the perceivable increase of the technical difficulty of the required explicit construction of the metrics @xmath17 has been softened by the discretization of the coordinates , @xmath18 ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "the common differential toy - model hamiltonians @xmath19 were replaced by their difference - operator analogues .",
    "typically , the role of the kinetic energy @xmath20 was taken by a tridiagonal matrix ( i.e. , say , by the well known runge - kutta approximation of the laplacean ) .",
    "simultaneously , the diagonal potential - energy matrix @xmath21 was generalized into a tridiagonal matrix which was not necessarily hermitian in @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 by @xmath23 hamiltonians of the generic form ^(n)= [ kitielor ] may be interpreted as representing an open - end @xmath23-site nearest - neighbor - interaction quantum lattice @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we intend to complement the existing studies of various open - end versions of the @xmath23-site quantum lattice  ( [ kitielor ] ) ( cf",
    ". , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite , with further references ) by the next - step study of its generalization ^(n)= ,  n = 2j .",

    "the motivation of such a project is twofold .",
    "firstly , the introduction of the  anomalous \" matrix elements @xmath24 enables us to study the spectral consequences of the tunable input interaction of a long - range character .",
    "section [ pertur ] will pay particular attention to the effects of this long - range perturbation on a _ maximally degenerate _",
    "ep singularity at @xmath25 .",
    "we shall sample alternative scenarios of the removal of this degeneracy .    secondly , we feel motivated by the simplicity - preserving character of the transition from eq .",
    "( [ kitielor ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ kitiel ] ) . in section [ nepertur ] a few exactly solvable benchmark models will be presented , demonstrating an enrichment of the variability of the spectrum in non - perturbative regime .",
    "our models will exhibit _ multiple complexifications _ of the energies at the ep boundary @xmath9 .",
    "our observations and proposals will be finally summarized in section [ vis ] .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we proposed a family of multi - parametric @xmath26dimensional matrices ( [ kitielor ] ) for which one is able to construct certain parts of the boundary @xmath9 in closed form , non - numerically . in an @xmath25 illustration of such a toy - model scenario",
    "let us recall the multiple - degeneracy - generating hamiltonian matrix @xmath27 = .",
    "[ sixsit ] the corresponding spectrum of energies stays unobservable ( complex ) at the negative  times \" @xmath28 while becoming , suddenly , completely degenerate at @xmath29 and strictly real and fully non - degenerate at all the positive @xmath30 .",
    "this fine - tuned multiple - degeneracy behavior of the spectrum ( sampled here in fig .",
    "[ fiebb ] ) may immediately be extended to any dimension @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we shall check what may happen when the linear chain of eq .",
    "( [ kitielor ] ) is being replaced by the ring - shaped chain represented by eq .",
    "( [ kitiel ] ) .",
    "it has recently been hinted in the literature that the open - end non - hermitian quantum lattices are exceptional  since periodic boundary conditions are incompatible with the @xmath0symmetry \" @xcite . for several reasons , such",
    "a comment attracted our attention .",
    "first of all , we felt puzzled by the potential physical consequences of such a statement since it contradicted our older empirical experience with the existence of strong parallels between the open- and coupled - end quantum lattices @xcite .    during our subsequent analysis of the problem we imagined that its very core is entirely artificial .",
    "the source of the misunderstanding may simply be traced back to certain ambiguity of the current terminology . in an introductory remark",
    "let us , therefore , recall a few relevant definitions while restricting our present attention , for the sake of simplicity , just to hamiltonians ( [ kitielor ] ) or  ( [ kitiel ] ) with _ real _ matrix elements .    in the first step",
    "let us slightly simplify the complex - hamiltonian conventions as accepted in ref .",
    "thus , our present interpretation of the @xmath0symmetry property @xmath31 of the real hamiltonians will employ the time - reversal @xmath32 represented just by the operator of matrix transposition .",
    "secondly , the specific choice of the parity operator = [ parita ] will be assumed fixed in advance .",
    "thirdly , let us clearly distinguish between the concepts of the so called unbroken and broken @xmath0symmetry where , by definition , the whole spectrum of @xmath2 is real or not real , respectively .    in a more explicit concise explanation involving , for the sake of brevity , just the non - hermitian @xmath0symmetric hamiltonians ( i.e. , matrices @xmath33 such that @xmath34 ) with non - degenerate ( though , in general , complex ) spectra , one must distinguish between the right - eigenvector schrdinger equation @xmath35 and the left - eigenvector schrdinger equation @xmath36 ( or , equivalently , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .    in this notation one",
    "easily separates the real - energy case  a \" ( in which @xmath40 ) and the complex - energy case  b \" ( in which @xmath41 at a subscript @xmath42 ) .",
    "as long as we can always write @xmath43 in both of these cases , it is easy to conclude that |r_n= const    literature on @xmath0symmetric hamiltonians , the validity of proportionality ( [ symwf ] ) between the left and right eigenvectors _ at all _ @xmath44 is , conveniently , called the unbroken @xmath0symmetry of the quantum system in question .",
    "thus , one must be a bit careful when reading ref .",
    "@xcite where the models with unbroken @xmath1symmetry are called  models in @xmath0symmetric phase \" .",
    "this being explained , we believe that there is no true reason for taking the circular lattices ( i.e. , in our case , systems with hamiltonians ( [ kitiel ] ) mimicking the periodic boundary conditions and representing the circular lattices of the shape sampled in fig .",
    "[ sefi ] ) as a perceivably more complicated option .",
    "we might even conjecture that as long as the circular shape of the lattice may be perceived as an elementary exemplification of a topologically nontrivial quantum graph of a non - tree shape , the presence of the end - point bonds might be interpreted , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , as a hidden source of potentially interesting anomalies in the spectrum .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to the even@xmath45 subset of models ( [ kitiel ] ) .",
    "the main reason is that under this restriction our hamiltonians will exhibit more parallels with their differential - equation predecessors . in particular",
    ", we shall always employ just the manifestly coupling - independent operator @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ parita ] ) which strongly resembles the standard parity with its equal number of positive and negative eigenvalues .      for",
    "a sampling of the effects of the periodicity - simulating lattice - ends couplings @xmath46 let us return to the six - site open - end - lattice spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fiebb ] and let us treat the bonding matrix elements @xmath46 as a small perturbation to this unperturbed form of the @xmath0symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "let us consider the first sample of such a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath47 , with the perturbation specified as follows , w_1= ,  w = .",
    "the resulting modified @xmath48dependence of the spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fiedeeb ] .",
    "we see that the original collapse of the whole spectrum gets split .",
    "a twin partial collapse is shifted to the right ( i.e. , to @xmath49 ) while the ultimate complete complexification moved to the left ( i.e. , to negative @xmath50 ) .      from the observations made in paragraph [ prece ]",
    "one can conclude that both the maximal degeneracy ( at @xmath29 ) and the big - bang - like behavior ( at the small @xmath30 ) of the spectrum as sampled by fig .",
    "[ fiebb ] are in fact very sensitive to perturbations .",
    "the form of this perturbation is highly relevant for the guarantee of the stability of the perturbed quantum system , i.e. , of the reality of its bound - state energies .",
    "the determination of the boundary @xmath9 of the domain @xmath3 of the parameters which are compatible with the stability is important .",
    "certain qualitative features of this boundary ( or  horizon \" ) may even be guessed _",
    "a priori_. typically , one may expect that the system gets less stable , i.e. , the size of the domain @xmath3 will shrink in the strong - coupling regime . in parallel , the destabilizing effect of the growth of the end - bond @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "[ sefi ] ) may be compensated by the decrease ( or , alternatively , enhanced by the further increase ) of some other non - hermiticity measure ( i.e. , for the sake of definiteness , of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ sefi ] ) .",
    "the consequences are both interesting and hardly predictable .",
    "figures  [ fiedeece ] and [ fiedeeef ] offer an illustration of the effect .",
    "these pictures illustrate a scenario of destabilization in which , in spite of the perceivable growth of @xmath53 ( i.e. , in spite of our making the ring better bound ) , the dominant role is still played by the smaller perturbation of the close - to - critical @xmath54 .",
    "this guess may be assisted by the toy - model hamiltonian @xmath55 with w_2= ,  w = .",
    "[ fifi ] the mechanism of the dominance of the enhancement of the central coupling is demonstrated by figs .",
    "[ fiedeece ] and [ fiedeeef ] .",
    "we see there the remarkable pattern of complexification in which the rightmost exceptional point @xmath56 of the loss of the crypto - hermiticity ( i.e. , of the reality of the whole spectrum ) is determined by @xmath54 while the next coordinate @xmath57 of the remaining two mergers and subsequent complexifications already reflects the combined effect of the whole perturbation .",
    "a qualitative novelty may be seen in the re - emergence of a small island of the reality of as many as four central energies in a very small vicinity of @xmath29 .",
    "this phenomenon is a close analogue of the similar spectral ",
    "reality - island \" anomaly encountered , in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the strong - coupling regime of another topologically nontrivial model .",
    "the explicit evaluation of the periodic - lattice spectra remains a more or less purely numerical problem in the tight - binding regime , especially at the larger @xmath23 .",
    "one still encounters exactly solvable secular equations at the smallest even @xmath58 .",
    "_ in extremis _",
    ", many generic features of the periodic - lattice spectra may be understood even via their first nontrivial four - site - lattice realization .",
    "once we pick up the following one - parametric four - site toy model with equal couplings , h_(ec)= [ away ] we reveal that the whole spectrum remains real up to the strong - coupling dynamical regime , i.e. , even beyond @xmath59 ( cf . the graphical representation of this spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fiedeero ] ) . for our present purposes",
    "it is also useful that the spectrum is in fact available in closed form , e_0=- ,   e_1=-1 ,   e_2=1 ,   e_3=. [ twoe ] one localizes , precisely , the unavoided - crossing points @xmath60 as well as the points of the ultimate complexification @xmath61 .",
    "all of these four values are the exceptional points in the kato s sense @xcite . in order to see this",
    ", one may recall eq .",
    "( [ twoe ] ) and pick up , say , eigenvalues @xmath62 and @xmath63 of our hamiltonian ( [ away ] ) .",

    ".    inside the non - anomalous domain @xmath71 of @xmath67 our choice of the first nontrivial @xmath72 enables us to find a _",
    "complete _ family of all of the candidates for the metric in principle . a sample of the necessary linear algebra reconstructing , basically",

    "an entirely exhaustive explicit construction of the metrics @xmath73 has been performed there for a certain extremely elementary one - parametric model . here , we shall only pick up a single , characteristic solution = [ metra2 ] as a candidate for the metric in @xmath74 . in order to confirm its eligibility",
    "we must prove that it is positive definite .",
    "such a proof is easy since the two eigenvalues of our candidate matrix happen to possess the elementary form @xmath75 the other two eigenvalues are obtained by the replacement @xmath76 .",
    "this implies the positivity of our matrix ( [ metra2 ] ) inside the interval of t ( -,):=d_(-1.225,1.225 ) .",
    "we see that our choice of special metric is satisfactory since this interval covers more than 86 % of the whole crypto - hermiticity domain of the hamiltonian itself .",
    "let us now replace the fine - tuned one - parametric four - site model ( [ away ] ) by its perturbation h= h_(ec)+ .",
    "[ awayab ] figure [ fiedeese ] illustrates the changes .",

    "we found that a core of the consistency of such a transition ( which could suffer from its potential  fragility \" in general @xcite ) is similar to the suppression of the fragility in open - ends models .    via a thorough description of a few not too complicated examples we illustrated that in _ both _ the open - end and matched - ends models , the stability and the robust nature ( i.e. , non - fragile nature ) of the models results from the absence of the degeneracy of spectra of the zero - coupling versions of the hamiltonians in question .",
    "the role of the matching matrix elements of the hamiltonian remains , in the phenomenological perspective , slightly counterintuitive .",
    "still , the decisive conceptual parallels between periodic lattices and the mathematically more friendly open - end lattices were noticed .",
    "they involve not only the encouraging emergence of the parallel structures in the spectra of energies but also in the shapes of the domains of the reality of the energies or of the positivity of the matrix candidates for the metrics .",
    "an important merit of our specific models may be seen in the feasibility of calculations .",
    "this resulted from the preservation of multiple parallels between our present matched - ends models and their open - ends predecessors ( let us mention just the up - down symmetry , equidistance of the unperturbed spectra or the reality of the interaction matrices ) . nevertheless , even beyond the level of the low - dimensional solvable examples the more general questions of consistency of the underlying quantum theory were addressed .",
    "our constructive study of the chains defined along discrete loops appeared more friendly than expected .",
    "our detailed analyses covered the extensive dynamical domain , far beyond the mere weak - coupling subdomain .",
    "our periodicity - simulating bonds proved connected to the emergence of unexpected spectral phenomena ( like the strong - coupling - related islands of stability ) which will certainly deserve a further study in the future .",
