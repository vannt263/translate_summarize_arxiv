    "along with the improvement of the measurement precision of physical experiments , we need more and more radiative - correction calculations beyond one - loop level . the fermion mass renormalization scheme has been discussed enough at one - loop level @xcite , but is rarely discussed beyond one - loop level . at present",
    "there are two mass renormalization schemes : the conventional on - shell scheme @xcite and the recently proposed pole scheme @xcite .",
    "people have pointed out that the mass definition of pole scheme is gauge invariant compared with the on - shell scheme @xcite , but this conclusion is only based on a native hypothesis that the location of the complex pole of the propagator is gauge independent at any order in perturbation theory @xcite and a strict proof of the hypothesis hasnt been present .",
    "so we need to further investigate this problem . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the gauge dependence of fermion mass definition .    in order to obtain the fermion mass renormalization scheme beyond one - loop level",
    "we firstly investigate the fermion inverse propagator i s^-1(p)=p - m_0+(p ) p(a_l+b_r)+c_l+d_r , where @xmath1 is the bare fermion mass , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the left- and right- handed helicity operators , and ( p)=p_l^l(p^2)+p_r^r(p^2 ) + m_l^s , l(p^2)+m_r^s , r(p^2 ) .",
    "when we renormalize fermion mass , the fermion propagator should be changed into @xcite s(p)==. the on - shell mass renormalization scheme requires the real part of the propagator s denominator equal to zero at the physical mass point , i.e. @xcite re[m^2(1+^l(m^2))(1+^r(m^2))-(m+m - m^s , l(m^2 ) ) ( m+m - m^s , r(m^2))]=0 . solving this equation about @xmath4 to two - loop level we obtain m&=&re[^l(m^2)+^r(m^2)+^s , l(m^2 ) + ^s , r(m^2)]-re^2 [ ^l(m^2)-^r(m^2 ) ] + & + & im^s , l(m^2)im^s , r(m^2 ) -im^l(m^2)im^r(m^2 ) . in eq.(5 ) we have used the fact @xmath5 at one - loop level .",
    "different from the on - shell scheme , the pole mass renormalization scheme requires both the real part and the imaginary part of the propagator s denominator equal to zero at the location of the propagator s complex pole @xcite |s(1+^l(|s))(1+^r(|s ) ) -(m_2+m_2-m_2^s , l(|s))(m_2+m_2-m_2^s , r(|s ) ) = 0 , where @xmath6 is the physical mass and @xmath7 is the location of the propagator s complex pole . solving this equation about @xmath8 to two - loop level we obtain m_2&=&re[^l(m_2 ^ 2)+^r(m_2 ^ 2)+^s , l(m_2 ^ 2 ) + ^s , r(m_2 ^ 2)]-re^2 [ ^l(m_2 ^ 2)-^r(m_2 ^ 2 ) ] + & + & im^s , l(m_2 ^ 2)im^s , r(m_2 ^ 2 ) -im^l(m_2 ^ 2)im^r(m_2 ^ 2 ) + & + & m_2 ^ 2im[^l(m_2 ^ 2)+^r(m_2 ^ 2 ) + ^s , l(m_2 ^ 2)+^s , r(m_2",

    "if fermion mass is defined gauge independently , its counterterm must be also gauge independent @xcite .",
    "this can be used to test whether the fermion mass definition is gauge independent . in the following calculations we will investigate whether eq.(5 ) and eq.(7 )",
    "are gauge independent . for convenience",
    "we only consider w gauge parameter s dependence in the @xmath11 gauge and only introduce physical parameter s counterterms .",
    "note that we have used the computer program packages _ feynarts _ and _ feyncalc _ @xcite in the following calculations .",
    "we give top quark s mass counterterm as an example to investigate this problem . since nobody has discussed this problem before , we begin the discussion from the one - loop level .",
    "the one - loop top quark s @xmath12-dependent self - energy and tadpole diagrams are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 , where @xmath12 is w gauge parameter .",
    "we note that in order to investigate the gauge dependence of mass counterterm the tadpole diagrams of fig.2 must be included @xcite .",
    "+     +    we firstly obtain the @xmath12-dependent contribution of fig.1 to top quark s one - loop mass counterterm ( see eqs.(5,7 ) ) re[^l(m_t^2)+^r(m_t^2)+^s , l(m_t^2 ) + ^s , r(m_t^2)]__w=_w 1+b_0(0 , _",

    "@xmath15 is electron charge , @xmath16 is the sine of weak mixing angle , and @xmath17 is the passarino - veltman function @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath12-dependent contribution of fig.2 to top quark s one - loop mass counterterm is re[^l(m_t^2)+^r(m_t^2)+^s , l(m_t^2 ) + ^s , r(m_t^2)]__w=-_w 1+b_0(0 , _",
    "w m_w^2 , _ w m_w^2 ) . from eqs.(9,10 ) one readily see that the top quark s one - loop mass counterterm is gauge independent .",
    "now we calculate the gauge dependence of top quark s two - loop mass counterterm . for convenience",
    "we only calculate the gauge dependence of the branch cut of top quark s mass counterterm .",
    "since the gauge - dependent branch cut of top quark s mass counterterm comprises gauge - dependent heaviside function only ( see below ) and the other part of top quark s mass counterterm does nt contain such function , this simplified treatment is reasonable and will not break our final conclusion .",
    "the branch cut of top quark s two - loop mass counterterm will be calculated by the _ cutting rules _ @xcite .",

    "we firstly discuss the case of on - shell mass renormalization scheme .",
    "it is obvious that at two - loop level the second term of the r.h.s . of eq.(5 ) does nt contain branch cut .",

    "we need to calculate top quark s two - loop self energy .",
    "the top quark s two - loop self energy can be classified into two kinds : one contains the one - loop counterterm , the second does nt contain any counterterm . since except for ckm matrix elements all the one - loop physical parameter s counterterms are real numbers and free of branch cut @xcite , the first kind self energy does nt contribute to the branch cut of eq.(5 ) , because except the one - loop counterterm the left part of the self energy is the one - loop self energy which real part is free of branch cut .",
    "here we do nt need to worry about the problem of the ckm matrix elements and their counterterms being complex numbers , because the total contribution of them to eq.(5 ) is real number ( see the appendix for example ) .",
    "so we only need to consider the second kind self energy . according to the _ cutting rules _ of ref.@xcite",
    ", the second kind self energy can also be classified into three kinds : one does nt contain branch cut , the second contains branch cut , but its branch cut does nt contribute to eq.(5 ) , the third contains branch cut and its branch cut contributes to eq.(5 ) @xcite .",

    "although a self energy is usually defined to comprise one - particle - irreducible diagrams only , no physical principle demonstrates the one - particle - reducible diagram can not be included in a correct self energy .",
    "furthermore in the following calculations of top quark s mass counterterm one will see the one - particle - reducible diagram in fig.3 guarantees the gauge independence of the branch cut of top quark s mass definition under the ple mass renormalization scheme .",
    "in fig.3 we also draw the possible cuts of the first four topologies which contribute to eq.(5 ) , where the propagator with an arrow on it denotes it is cut and the arrow represents the _ positive - on - shell _ momentum propagating direction of the cut propagator @xcite ) .",

    "this means the conventional on - shell mass definition is gauge dependent according to the discussion at the begining of this section .",
    "then we calculate the gauge dependence of top quark s two - loop mass counterterm under the pole mass renormalization scheme .",
    "the result of the first three terms of eq.(7 ) is same as the result of eq.(5 ) .",

    "from the above discussion one readily sees that the conventional on - shell mass renormalization scheme is unreasonable .",

    "for convenience in eq.(18 ) we have approximated @xmath44 and averaged the result over the incoming particles polarization vectors and summed the result over the outgoing particles helicity states .",
    "since there is no other origin of function @xmath29 $ ] in the two - loop @xmath39@xmath40 , eq.(14 ) and eq.(18 ) mean the on - shell mass renormalization scheme makes the cross section of the physical process @xmath0 gauge dependent . from eqs.(14,18 ) we also find that the gauge dependence caused by the on - shell scheme can not be neglected at two - loop level . the concrete numerical result is shown in fig.7 .",

    "this leads to the physical result obtained by the on - shell mass renormalization scheme also gauge dependent . on the contrary ,",
    "we do nt find such gauge dependence in the pole mass renormalization scheme .",
    "besides , the gauge - dependent difference of the physical result between the two mass renormalization schemes can not be neglected at two - loop level .",
    "therefore we should use the pole mass renormalization scheme rather than the on - shell mass renormalization scheme to calculate physical results beyond one - loop level .      in this appendix",
