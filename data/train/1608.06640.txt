    "organic superconductors of the bedt family exhibit fascinating phenomena due to the interplay between strong electronic correlations and large magnetic frustration.@xcite for instance , their rich phase diagram contains @xmath9-wave superconducting , antiferromagnetic@xcite and possibly quantum spin liquid states at absolute zero.@xcite at finite temperature , a mott metal - insulator transition has clearly been identified.@xcite recently , a moderately one - dimensional organic compound has been synthesized.@xcite this 2d organic mott insulator , @xmath0-h@xmath1(cat - edt - ttf)@xmath2 , does not exhibit magnetic order at very low temperature ( @xmath10 mk ) , which makes it a serious candidate for a quantum spin liquid .",
    "microscopically , the simplest model describing this organic compound is the two - dimensional single - band hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice.@xcite this model is the same as that often used for bedt organic compounds.@xcite in order to focus our attention on @xmath0-h@xmath1(cat - edt - ttf)@xmath2 , we study the phase diagram of this model in the moderately one - dimensional ( m1d ) regime characterized by a ratio between the hopping terms @xmath4 and @xmath11 , defined in fig.[fig.sym_a ] , larger than unity .",
    "since we are interested in the mott transition and the possibility of a spin liquid , we use cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft),@xcite a cluster extension of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) that can treat both the metallic and the insulating phases , the mott transition between them as well as magnetic phases.@xcite    before we proceed , we briefly recall related studies , setting aside superconductivity that we do not consider here .",
    "previous work focused mostly on the frustrated regime @xmath12 ( square lattice to triangular lattice ) since these anisotropy values , usually obtained from ab initio calculations,@xcite corresponded to all known bedt organic compounds .",
    "theoretical investigations that were concerned with the mott transition in the interaction - frustration ( @xmath13 ) phase diagram used methods that included path - integral renormalization group  @xcite , variational methods ,  @xcite exact diagonalization,@xcite variational cluster approximation ,  @xcite cdmft @xcite and dual - fermion  @xcite approaches .",
    "although there are quantitative discrepancies between the different methods , metallic , insulating , non - magnetic , and antiferromagnetic phases were found , generally in good agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite a more detailed comparison between experiment and some of the above theoretical calculations appears in ref .. cdmft was one of the most successful approaches.@xcite    more recently , the m1d regime ( @xmath14 ) has been investigated:@xcite for @xmath15 , the hubbard model exhibits a spiral order and possibly a spin liquid phase .",
    "different theoretical lattice approaches seem to agree with the presence of a spin liquid and a collinear magnetic state with an associated ordering vector @xmath16 for @xmath17,@xcite even though they do not completely agree on the precise form of the phase diagram , unlike for the case @xmath18 . in the strong - interaction limit , _",
    "i.e _ for @xmath19 , where the hubbard model in the insulating phase reduces to the heisenberg model with exchange interactions @xmath20 and @xmath21 to second order in perturbation theory@xcite and , at higher order , to models with more complicated spin interactions , such as the two distinct ring exchange couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23.@xcite the heisenberg model corresponding to the m1d regime , _ i.e",
    "_ @xmath24 has been extensively studied using different methods such as linear spin - wave,@xcite coupled cluster method,@xcite variational monte - carlo@xcite or density matrix renormalization group.@xcite these methods show that a spiral state is present for @xmath25 but they give different magnetic phases in the m1d regime , _",
    "e.g _ a spiral phase , a collinear magnetic phase or a spin liquid state .",
    "more sophisticated hamiltonians including the ring exchange coupling @xmath26 in the anisotropic triangular lattice give a rich phase diagram where the presence of a nel state , a spin liquid state or a spiral phase depends on the relative strength between @xmath27 and @xmath28.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : the hubbard model and the cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft ) on a plaquette with an exact diagonalization ( ed ) impurity solver are detailed in sec.[sec.model&method ] . in sec.[sec.results_normal ] , results for the normal state , showing a first order mott metal - insulator transition are presented .",
    "magnetic states are explored in sec.[sec.results_magnet ] .",
    "our results are summarized in the phase diagram of fig.[fig.entire_phase_diagram ] .",
    "finally , the choice of cluster is motivated in sec.[sec_cluster ] , where we show , by comparing results for the magnetic phases with other methods , that a cluster sharing symmetries with the lattice is essential for a reliable cdmft calculation in this regime .",
    "we conclude in sec.[sec.conclusion ] .",
    "we focus on the physics embodied in the hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice @xmath29 all quantities are expressed in natural units ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . here , @xmath32 are the hopping amplitudes between sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 and can take two different values , @xmath11 and @xmath4 , illustrated in fig.[fig.sym ] .",
    "the fourier transform of the hopping amplitudes @xmath32 determines the anisotropic bare dispersion @xmath35 -2t'\\cos(k_x + k_y)$ ]",
    ". the on - site coulomb repulsion is @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the chemical potential set so that the system is half - filled . for that filling , the signs of @xmath11 and @xmath4 do not modify the phase diagram .",
    "layered organic compounds are usually half - filled , but doped compounds  @xcite have been investigated experimentally  @xcite and theoretically.@xcite    we focus on the m1d regime @xmath6 using cdmft,@xcite a cluster extension of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite cdmft approximates the infinite lattice as a finite size cluster self - consistently coupled to a bath of non - interacting electrons , thus taking into account dynamical correlations as well as spatial correlations up to the size of the cluster.@xcite cdmft , like dmft , maps the system into an anderson impurity problem , which is then solved self - consistently . in this paper , the quantum impurity problem",
    "is solved using the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method @xcite at zero temperature .",
    "this method is restricted to a small number @xmath38 of bath sites .",
    "while the hamiltonian of the quantum impurity problem is coded exactly , the ground state and the green functions of interest are found in a quasi - exact way with the lanczos algorithm.@xcite exact diagonalization is robust in the presence of frustration , unlike quantum monte - carlo methods which suffer from the infamous sign problem.@xcite moreover , it directly computes dynamical quantities as a function of real frequencies .",
    "to summarize , the assumption inherent to cluster approaches is that the essential physics of the system originates from short - ranged correlations , which should be the case in strongly - correlated magnetically - frustrated organic compounds .",
    "we solve the following cluster - bath hamiltonian : @xmath39 where the indices @xmath40 label the sites within the cluster whereas @xmath41 label the bath sites .",
    "the second quantized operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 annihilate electrons on the cluster and in the bath , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 are the hopping matrix elements within the cluster , @xmath44 are the bath energies , and @xmath45 are the bath - cluster hybridization matrix elements . besides , in order to allow antiferromagnetism to appear , @xmath44 and @xmath45 explicitly carry a spin variable @xmath46 .",
    "a complication of the ed method is that the cdmft self - consistency condition can not be satisfied exactly because of the finite number of bath sites .",
    "this condition is rather satisfied approximately by minimizing a distance function . for further information on the matter ,",
    "see refs .  , and .",
    "we use the same distance function parameters as in the last two references , namely a frequency cut - off at @xmath47 and a `` fictitious '' inverse temperature @xmath48 . to check that there are no artifacts associated with the finite bath",
    ", we checked our results for the mott transition using cdmft with a continuous - time quantum monte - carlo ( ctqmc ) impurity solver @xcite at finite but low temperature ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "for both clusters that we describe below , we found agreement with our cdmft plus ed solver for the values of @xmath7 that we tested ( 0.4 and 1.5 ) .    as illustrated in fig.[cluster_cartoon ] , we use clusters of @xmath50 sites coupled to @xmath51 bath sites .",
    "although the calculation is for 2@xmath522 clusters , we expect to capture the main physics of the lattice since studies using cdmft have confirmed that results on a 2@xmath522 cluster are quantitatively similar to those on larger clusters , at least at high temperature.@xcite all physical results presented in the next sections are extracted from the symmetry - preserving ( sp ) cluster of fig.[fig.sym_b ] , whose parametrization within the model eq . is detailed in fig.[fig_sp ] . for large values of @xmath7 , one might argue that the quasi one - dimensional character of the lattice must be present in the cluster . in order to shed light on this question , the quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) cluster of fig.[fig.sym_b ] ,",
    "whose parametrization within the model eq . is detailed in fig.[fig_q1d ] , has also been investigated .",
    "our results , presented in the following sections , will show that the physics extracted from this second cluster geometry does not compare well with other methods , leading us to conclude that the sp cluster is a better representation of the infinite lattice in the m1d regime .",
    "first , let us focus on the mott transition in the normal state .",
    "magnetic states are forbidden if one suppresses the spin dependence of the bath parameters .",
    "the phase diagram was obtained by changing @xmath53 in steps of @xmath54 and varying @xmath55 in much smaller steps .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath53 quoted for phase boundaries in the following have an uncertainty of order @xmath56 .",
    "we find that as long as @xmath57 , the double occupancy displays hysteresis bounded by jumps at @xmath58 and @xmath59 as @xmath36 decreases or increases , respectively ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these jumps are the signature of the usual mott transition . for the sp cluster at @xmath61 ,",
    "the hysteresis region is still present but is bounded by a jump only when @xmath36 decreases .",
    "as @xmath36 increases , a mere change of slope occurs , as shown in fig.[d ] . even without a jump in the double - occupancy ,",
    "the mott transition can be observed by studying the low - frequency behavior of the local density of states @xmath62 , as presented in fig.[fig.dos ] for @xmath63 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "slightly smaller than the upper critical ratio @xmath65 at @xmath63 , the local density of states exhibits a low - frequency metallic behavior .",
    "when @xmath55 is increased only by a tiny fraction to @xmath66 , the opening of an insulating gap in the local density of states signals the mott transition .",
    "the mott transition of the q1d cluster , presented in fig.[d_ng ] , does not even feature a jump or some hysteresis in the double occupancy .",
    "the local density of states , however , indicates a mott transition ( not shown ) .",
    "+    the critical ratios @xmath65 presented in fig.[fig.comparaison ] as a function of @xmath7 illustrate one of the main differences between the two cluster geometries considered in this paper .",
    "indeed , for @xmath67 , @xmath65 first decreases before increasing for the q1d cluster whereas it only increases monotonically for the sp cluster .",
    "surprisingly , this discrepancy between the two cluster geometries does not hold for @xmath68 since both geometries yield the same value of @xmath65 even if one could assume that the q1d cluster should be more appropriate only in the m1d regime .",
    "an acceptable explanation for this phenomenon has not been found yet , but the following section will give arguments that lead us to believe that the results for the sp cluster capture the correct physics .",
    "within cdmft , one can only look for commensurate magnetic orders on the cluster .",
    "therefore , this restriction does not allow us to explore all possible magnetic phases nor to distinguish between a spin liquid and an incommensurate magnetic order ( in the sense of a magnetic order whose unit cell does not perfectly fit or repeat within the cluster ) .",
    "hence , we can only rule out a spin liquid by demonstrating that a magnetic phase exists , but we can not prove that a spin liquid state will occur since we can not explore all possible magnetic states .",
    "in other words , not finding one of the allowed magnetic states of our cluster in a mott insulating phase is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for a spin liquid .",
    "a spin - liquid state could occur only in a non - magnetic insulating state ( nmi state ) .    for reasons that will become clear below",
    ", we present our final phase diagram , including magnetic order , only for the sp cluster .",
    "one can check from fig.[fig.phase_diagram ] that for @xmath57 , we find the same results as in ref . , namely a transition from a metal to a nel state for @xmath69 , followed by a nmi state that starts right above the mott transition for @xmath70 and then undergoes a nel transition at larger @xmath55 if @xmath71 .",
    "we did not investigate @xmath72 .",
    "previous studies indicate that a spiral order or a spin liquid could be present in this area of the phase diagram,@xcite corresponding to the nmi state of fig.[fig.phase_diagram ] .    for @xmath73 , a first - order transition between a metal and a collinear magnetic insulating state ( cms ) takes place for @xmath74 or @xmath75 upon increasing @xmath55 , before the mott transition , as shown in fig.[fig.phase_diagram ] , and survives at larger values of @xmath55 .",
    "the presence of this phase is not surprising since different studies predict the appearance of this magnetic phase in the m1d regime using lattice models @xcite or spin models.@xcite at this magnetic transition , we observe a jump in the double - occupancy and a gap opening in the spectral function .",
    "some hysteresis can be seen in the double - occupancy , but while the upper critical interaction @xmath76 can always be detected for any value of @xmath7 , the lower critical interaction @xmath77 can not always be found due to some numerical instability ( hence the absence of bars for the red triangles of fig.[fig.phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig.phase_diagram_alt ] shows the same phase diagram as fig.[fig.phase_diagram ] using @xmath4 instead of @xmath11 as the unit of energy to allow an easier comparison with the results of ref ..    it is interesting to compare the phase diagram of fig.[fig.phase_diagram ] with the one presented in ref .",
    "for the half - filled square lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping ( more suited to the study of cuprates ) .",
    "this model is different and the method is the variational cluster approximation ( vca),@xcite but it presents the same collinear magnetic phase with ordering wave vector @xmath74 or @xmath75 , for @xmath7 larger than @xmath78 .",
    "we saw that the results obtained with the q1d cluster differ from those for the sp cluster .",
    "we have checked that the assumption that the mott transition occurs when @xmath36 is of the order of the bandwidth is not sufficient to choose the appropriate cluster , although in this context the non - monotonic dependence on @xmath7 of the mott metal - insulator transition is suggestive of the inadequacy of the q1d cluster . however , based on the symmetries satisfied by the sp cluster , as illustrated in fig.[fig.sym ] , it should capture the correct physics .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the predictions for the magnetic state obtained with the sp cluster agree with the results of other methods that are available for comparisons . with the q1d cluster",
    "there is no commensurable magnetic state at all in the m1d regime while other methods find stable magnetic long - range order .",
    "first , we searched for collinear magnetic state @xmath74 using the restricted hartree - fock approximation on a 18@xmath5218 cluster .",
    "this method allows one , in principle , to map the phase diagram for a large but finite number of magnetic states and to study larger clusters than in cdmft . here , we used hartree - fock just to confirm our magnetic phase diagram in the m1d regime for the sp cluster .",
    "we thus allowed only two magnetic states : the nel order and the collinear magnetic state .",
    "even though cdmft and hartree - fock methods can not be compared quantitatively , a qualitative agreement is found : for @xmath79 , a first - order metal to antiferromagnetic ( @xmath80 , @xmath80 ) insulator transition takes place at a finite interaction @xmath81 , whereas for @xmath17 , a first order metal to collinear magnetic insulator transition is found .",
    "although the same magnetic states and the same order of transition are found in the same range of @xmath7 as in the cdmft plus ed solver method , the critical hartree - fock interaction @xmath81 has a lower value , around @xmath82 , mainly due to the fact that the hartree - fock method is purely a mean - field theory that neglects the fluctuations that renormalize down the value of the interaction .",
    "kanamori - brckner screening is an example of renormalization mechanism that is neglected in hartree - fock .    finally , the critical interaction for collinear magnetism found with the sp cluster exhibits qualitatively the same dependency on frustration as in the phase diagram of ref . obtained by variational methods .",
    "the phase diagram in fig.[fig.tocchio ] presents our results with the same axis as in ref . to ease the comparison .",
    "even though it is not a rigorous proof , the fact that the appearance of a collinear magnetic state for @xmath83 is supported by three different numerical methods gives solid arguments in favor of its presence in this region of the phase diagram .",
    "the lack of collinear magnetism with the q1d cluster is an additional argument , beyond symmetry , to reject that cluster .",
    "in the moderately one - dimensional regime of the hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice , a symmetry - preserving cluster should be preferred to a quasi one - dimensional cluster geometry for calculations with cluster dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "the symmetry - preserving cluster gives magnetic phases in agreement with other methods .    with the symmetry - preserving cluster",
    ", we obtained the phase diagram using cdmft with an exact diagonalization solver in the moderately one - dimensional regime .",
    "there is a line of first - order mott transition where the critical @xmath55 monotonically increases with @xmath7 .",
    "we also found a first - order metal - to - collinear magnetic state transition that occurs for @xmath61 and does not allow any spin liquid state to appear in this regime . for @xmath84 , no sign of magnetic states covering the metal - insulator transition has been found .",
    "a spin liquid or a magnetic order which is not commensurate with our cluster , such as a spiral order , might however appear in this region",
    ".    our results at @xmath85 are particularly relevant for experiment since they are supposed to describe the organic compound @xmath0-h@xmath1(cat - edt - ttf)@xmath2 that seems to be a good candidate for a spin liquid state.@xcite at @xmath85 , the collinear magnetic state appears at a critical interaction strength that is slightly lower than the mott critical interaction in the normal state .",
    "this would suggest that there can not be a spin liquid state , _",
    "i.e. _ a non - magnetic insulating state , since the magnetic phase covers the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "however , the uncertainty on the value of @xmath7 and the fact that the magnetic and mott transitions are so close to each other does not allow us to strictly exclude a spin liquid state for @xmath85 .",
    "had @xmath7 been much larger , this possibility would have been excluded .",
    "one should also recall that other physical effects may need to be taken into account to model the real material , such as multi - band effects , near - neighbor repulsion etc .",
    "we are grateful to r. valenti , s. verret and especially m. gringas , for numerous suggestions and discussions .",
    "we also thank p. smon for the ctqmc impurity solver .",
