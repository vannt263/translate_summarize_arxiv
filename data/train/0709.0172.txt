    "over the last decade , scientists have been looking for some common , possibly universal , features of the collective behaviors of animals @xcite , bacteria @xcite , cells @xcite , molecular motors @xcite , as well as driven granular objects @xcite .",
    "the collective motion of a group of autonomous agents ( or particles ) is currently a subject of intensive research that has potential applications in biology , physics and engineering .",
    "one of the most remarkable characteristics of complex dynamical systems such as flocks of birds , schools of fish , or swarms of locusts , is the emergence of a state of collective orders in which the agents move in the same direction , i.e. an ordered state @xcite .",
    "this ordered state seeking problem can be further generalized to a consensus problem @xcite , where a group of self - propelled agents agree upon certain quantities of interest such as attitude , position , temperature , voltage , etc . furthermore , solving consensus problems using distributed computational methods has direct implications on sensor network data fusion , load balancing , swarms / flocks , unmanned air vehicles ( uavs ) , attitude alignment of satellite clusters , congestion control of communication networks , multi - agent formation control , and so on @xcite .    among the most important early works on consensus problems ,",
    "fiedler @xcite showed that the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath0 , namely the _ algebraic connectivity _",
    ", of the laplacian matrix @xmath1 associated with the graph defining the network topology is directly related to the consensus speed of the network .",
    "it was also shown that a network with high algebraic connectivity is robust to both node - failures and edge - failures . in @xcite ,",
    "olfati - saber and murray analyzed consensus problems in networks of agents with continuous - time dynamics ( basically integrators ) , switching topology and time - delays , and proved that decreasing the largest eigenvalue @xmath2 of the laplacian matrix @xmath1 improves the consensus robustness of the network to time - delays .",
    "consequently , the condition number @xmath3 provides a measure of the consensus performance of the considered network in the sense that the smaller its value , the better the consensus performance ( consensus speed and robustness to time - delays ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors also provided a feasible range of sampling rates leading to consensus in the case of discrete - time dynamic networks . in this way",
    ", the theoretical foundations of general consensus problems were established . to improve the speed of convergence towards consensus , they further proposed a method based on the addition of a few long links to a regular lattice , thus transforming it into a small - world network @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , xiao and boyd transformed the fastest distributed linear averaging problem into a convex optimization problem by considering a particular per - step convergence optimization index .",
    "additionally , they proved that , when the network topology is symmetric , the problem of finding the fastest converging linear iteration can be cast as a semidefinite programming problem , and thus can be efficiently and globally solved . in @xcite ,",
    "consensus problems in a heterogeneous influence network were investigated by yang at al . and it was shown that , by decreasing the scaling exponent in the associated power - law distribution , the ability of the network to reach direction consensus among its agents is significantly enhanced due to the leading roles played by a few hub agents .    in summary , most of the previous works achieved performance improvements , such as increasing the consensus speed , improving the robustness to nodes and edges failures , or improving the ability to deal with time - delays , solely based on the currently available information flows on the network . in these works , the computing abilities of an agent of the network is fairly limited : the agent can only observe the current behavior ( state ) of its neighbors and update its state according to this observation .",
    "however , in natural bio - groups , individuals generally possess some higher level of predictive computing capabilities that they use for updating their state .",
    "experiments revealing the use of prediction mechanisms by individuals of a network have been described in the literature previously . in particular , as early as 1959 , woods @xcite designed some bee swarms experiments and provided evidences for the existence of certain predictive mechanism in bee swarms formation . in 1995 , montague _",
    "proposed simple hebbian learning rules to explain the predictive mechanisms used by bees when foraging in uncertain environments @xcite .",
    "apart from the investigation of the predictive mechanisms used during swarming and foraging , several researchers focused on the predictive functions of the optical and acoustical apparatuses of individuals inside bio - groups , especially the retina and cortex @xcite . based on intensive experiments on the bio - eyesight systems , it was found that , when an individual observer prepared to eye - follow a displacement of the visual stimulus , the visual form of adaptation was transferred from the current fixation to the future gaze position .",
    "these reported investigations support the conjecture of the existence of some predictive mechanisms inside many bio - groups .",
    "[ fig : bird_prediction ] [ 0.4 ]    in this paper , we show that , by introducing a predictive mechanism , it is possible to either significantly enhance the consensus speed obtainable under the constraint of a fixed amount of communication energy or to decrease the communication energy required to ensure a prescribed consensus speed .",
    "this observation allows us to infer that prediction mechanisms may exist universally in many natural bio - groups . a general physical picture illustrating this paradigm is given in fig .  1 , which is interpreted as follows : in widely - spread natural bio - groups composed of animals , bacteria , cells , etc",
    ", the next - step behavioral decision of each individual / particle / agent is not only based on the current available state information ( position , velocity , etc . ) of the other ( neighboring ) agents inside the group , but is also based on their predicted future states .",
    "more precisely , bearing in mind a few past states of its leader and neighbors , an agent can estimate their future states several steps ahead and then make a decision on its own action .",
    "estimation of these future states by each agent can eliminate the requirement of intensive communication among the agents so that the overall communication energy of the group can be reduced effectively . from an industrial application point of view",
    ", the phenomena and mechanisms reported in this paper may be applicable in some relevant prevailing engineering areas such as autonomous robot formations , sensor networks and uavs @xcite .",
    "each agent in such a group typically has limited power to send messages , and thus a larger sampling period is generally desirable to save communication energy . since using a predictive mechanism can sharply expand the range of feasible sampling periods , it should be useful for industrial applications where overall communication energy is limited .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ problem description ] , the two main problems addressed in this paper are formulated . in section  [ model predictive consensus protocol for all - to - all link networks ] , the all - to - all link _ model predictive control _ ( mpc )",
    "average - consensus protocol is presented together with its convergence analysis and some statistical simulation results . in section  [ model predictive consensus protocol for partial link networks ] ,",
    "the mpc consensus protocol is generalized to partial link networks .",
    "additionally , conditions that guarantee asymptotic convergence of the proposed protocol are provided , and simulation results showing its main characteristics and advantages are presented .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in order to discuss and illustrate the role of prediction mechanisms in networks of interconnected agents , we consider one of the simplest type of networks , i.e. networks of linearly interconnected integrators . the interconnection structure of such networks",
    "can typically be represented by a directed graph ( called _ digraph _ for short ) . in this representation of the network ,",
    "the @xmath4 nodes of the digraph represent the @xmath4 agents of the network and a weighted edge @xmath5 from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 indicates the existence of a communication link from agent @xmath6 to agent @xmath7 in the network .",
    "the digraph is denoted by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of nodes , @xmath10 is the set of edges , and @xmath11 is the associated weighted _ adjacency matrix _",
    ", i.e. @xmath12 , with nonnegative elements @xmath5 which are zero when there is no communication link from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is no self - cycle , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the state of node @xmath6 , which might represent physical quantities such as attitude , position , temperature , voltage , etc . to obtain a full representation of the dynamic network under consideration",
    ", we refer to it as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the network state and @xmath18 its _ topology _ ( or information flow ) .",
    "generally , we say that the nodes of a network have reached _ consensus _ if and only if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 . whenever the nodes of a network are all in agreement , their common value is called the _ group decision value_. if the group decision value is @xmath21 , the network is said to have reached the _ average - consensus_. in the rest of the paper , for brevity , we denote average - consensus by consensus .",
    "agents with continuous - time models are typically described by the integrator dynamics @xmath22 while agents with discrete - time models are described by the difference dynamics @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the sampling period or step - size .",
    "average - consensus is typically asymptotically reached using the _ routine _ consensus protocol @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the state difference between the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 agents of the network .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that , in a network @xmath29 with fixed topology and continuous - time dynamics determined by ( [ eq : continuous model ] ) , the routine protocol ( [ eq : routine control ] ) globally and asymptotically solves the consensus problem if and only if @xmath18 is _ strongly connected _ and _ balanced_. the assumption of a strongly connected network amounts to imposing that any two distinct nodes can be connected via a path that follows the direction of the edges of the digraph .",
    "the balanced network assumption corresponds to @xmath30 which is obviously more general than the _ symmetric network _",
    "condition , in which @xmath31 .    considering the routine protocol ( [ eq : routine control ] ) ,",
    "the dynamics of a network of continuous - time integrator agents is defined by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is called the _ graph laplacian matrix _ induced by the topology @xmath18 and is defined as @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath5 denotes the @xmath38 element of the adjacency matrix associated with @xmath18 . by construction , the laplacian matrix has zero row sum , i.e. @xmath39 with @xmath40^t_{n\\times 1}$ ] .    for agents with discrete - time dynamics ( [ eq : discrete model ] ) , applying the discrete - time version of the routine consensus protocol ( [ eq : routine control ] ) yields the following discrete - time network dynamics : @xmath41 with @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the maximum node out - degree of the digraph @xmath18 . as shown in @xcite and @xcite , if the network is strongly connected and balanced , and the sampling period @xmath44 , the routine consensus protocol ( [ eq : routine control ] ) ensures global asymptotic convergence to consensus .",
    "some previous works were devoted to accelerating the speed of convergence towards consensus ( see for example @xcite ) since high - speed consensus is obviously always desirable in engineering practice . on the other hand , extension of the consensus feasible range of the sampling period @xmath24 is also important as it typically allows for a reduction in the required communication energy and may provide an explanation for the fundamental mechanisms used by bio - groups to exhibit collective behaviors .",
    "accordingly , two naturally - motivated problems are addressed in this paper :    * the increase of the average - consensus speed ; * the extension of the feasible range of the sampling period .",
    "the approach to be taken is based on the introduction of some predictive mechanism .    for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that all the networks considered in the rest of the paper are strongly connected .",
    "in this section , we first introduce an mpc algorithm to solve the average - consensus problem for _ all - to - all link networks _ ( or _ complete graphs _ in which each pair of vertices is connected by an edge ) .",
    "we then provide some theorems that support this algorithm .",
    "afterwards , we give some simulation results to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of this mpc consensus algorithm .      in order to improve the consensus performances , we replace the routine control protocol given in ( [ eq : routine control ] ) by the following mpc consensus protocol :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is an additional term representing the mpc action , and the state difference @xmath47 . with this mpc protocol ,",
    "the network dynamics are given by    @xmath48    with @xmath49^{t}$ ] representing the mpc decision values for the @xmath4 nodes of @xmath18 .",
    "the mpc element @xmath50 will be calculated by solving the optimization problem associated with a specific moving - horizon optimization index function ( see ( [ eq : optimization index ] ) , for example ) .",
    "using the consensus protocol ( [ eq : mpc law ] ) , the future network state can be predicted based on the current state value @xmath51 as follows :    @xmath52    here ,",
    "the integers @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent the prediction and control horizons , respectively .",
    "more specifically , @xmath53 defines the number of future steps which have to be predicted , while @xmath54 is the length of the future predicted control sequence . by definition ,",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath55 .    in this way",
    ", the future evolution of the network can be predicted @xmath53 steps ahead , as @xmath56 with @xmath57_{1\\times h_p n},\\\\    u^t(k)=\\left[v^{t}(k),\\ldots , v^{t}(k+h_u-1)\\right]_{1\\times h_u n } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath58_{h_p    n \\times n}$ ] , and the expression of @xmath59 given by ( [ eq : pu ] ) in _ appendix [ app1]_.    bearing in mind the goal of consensus protocol , i.e. eliminating the disagreement of all the individuals of the network , we first calculate the state difference of agents @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the network , @xmath60 steps ahead , using the operator @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63_{1\\times n}$ ] .",

    "it then follows from ( [ eq : state difference iteration ] ) that @xmath68^t_{h_pn(n-1)/2 \\times 1 } \\nonumber\\\\      & = & ex(k+1)=e(p_xx(k)+p_uu(k ) ) \\nonumber\\\\      & = & p_{xe}x(k)+p_{ue}u(k)\\label{eq : network_state_diff_dynamics}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    to solve the consensus problem , we first set the moving horizon optimization index that defines the mpc consensus problem as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are compatible real , symmetric , positive definite weighting matrices , and @xmath75 .",
    "in general , the weighting matrices can be set as @xmath76 in the optimization index ( [ eq : optimization index ] ) , the first term penalizes the state difference between each pair of states over the future @xmath53 steps , while the second term penalizes the additional mpc control energy @xmath50 .",
    "in order to minimize ( [ eq : optimization index ] ) , we compute @xmath77 , and obtain the optimal mpc action as : @xmath78 where @xmath79_{n\\times h_u n}\\nonumber \\\\    & & \\cdot(p_{ue}^tqp_{ue}+r)^{-1}p_{ue}^{t}qp_{xe},\\label{eq : pmpc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the identity and zero matrices of dimension @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the associated closed - loop dynamics can then be written as @xmath82    interestingly , the proposed algorithm shows some consistency with the routine protocol ( [ eq : routine control ] ) .",
    "more precisely , the latter is solely based on the current state difference @xmath83 of each pair in the network while the former roots not only in the current state difference @xmath84 but also in the future state difference @xmath85 , which constitutes the main improvement of this method .      for symmetric all - to - all link networks , it can be shown that @xmath86 and @xmath87 share the same eigenvectors .",

    "in this paper , in order to reveal the role of predictive mechanisms in many natural bio - groups , we have added a certain kind of predictive mechanism to the routine consensus protocol to design a novel mpc protocol .",
    "furthermore , we have presented mathematical analysis as well as statistical simulation results to show the improvement of consensus performances through the use of such a protocol .    in particular",
    ", we have compared the routine , fdla and mpc consensus protocols in the general cases of symmetric and asymmetric , balanced all - to - all link networks , and asymmetric balanced partial link networks .",
    "the comparisons have led to the following two conclusions : ( i ) the convergence speed towards consensus can be significantly increased to approach the global optimum via the predictive mechanism , namely , even short - term inspection of the future can produce a significant increase in convergence speed ; ( ii ) the sampling period range guaranteeing convergence is increased sharply by this predictive mechanism , giving the mpc protocol the potential to effectively save communication energy .",
    "these advantages have been explained through mathematical analysis of the eigenvalue distributions .    to investigate the predictive mechanism more analytically , we have provided some necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing asymptotic convergence towards average - consensus for all - to - all link and partial link networks , respectively . in particular , we have considered the special case of balanced all - to - all link networks and showed that the proposed mpc protocol can effectively compress the eigenvalue cluster of the system state matrix and drive it back towards the origin of the complex plane when the sampling period is increased beyond the routine convergence threshold . in the special case of symmetric all - to - all link networks",
    ", we proved that the corresponding state matrix @xmath113 shares the same eigenvectors as the matrix @xmath87 .    furthermore , to verify the generality of these conclusions ,",
    "we have also applied the proposed mpc protocol to two popular complex network models , the vicsek model @xcite and the attractive / repulsive model @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results presented in @xcite show that predictive protocol outperforms the routine protocol when taking into consideration both the consensus speed and the communication cost .    for natural science ,",
    "the contribution of this work lies in its ability to explain why networks of biological flocks / swarms / schools such as firefly and deep - sea fish groups do not communicate very frequently all along but only occasionally during the whole dynamical process . from the industrial application point of view ,",
    "the value of this work is two - fold : the consensus speed can be significantly enhanced , and the communication energy or cost can be reduced remarkably .",
    "all these merits are at the cost of giving the agents the capabilities of making predictions , which can be efficiently achieved based on currently available information .",
    "this work is just a first attempt aiming at achieving ultrafast - consensus by injecting a prediction mechanism into classical consensus algorithms such as the routine consensus protocol , and we hope it will open up new avenues in biological and industrial applications .",
    "finally , we stress that the presented results rely on a centralized control approach . in ongoing works",
    ", we are developping a decentralized version of these mpc consensus algorithms .",
    "first , it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath173 in ( [ eq : prediction system ] ) has the following structure @xmath174.\\ ] ] furthermore , we have @xmath175^{t}.\\ ] ]    the weighting matrices @xmath176 are selected as in ( [ eq : qr ] ) .",
    "straightforward calculations then show that @xmath177_{h_un\\times      1}^{t } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 denote polynomial functions of @xmath88 with orders determined by @xmath53 , @xmath54 and coefficients determined by @xmath146 .",
    "on the other hand , recall the definition @xmath69 and take into consideration that @xmath184 .",
    "we have @xmath201 with @xmath202 being a symmetric matrix .",
    "then , @xmath203^t=\\left[p_{\\epsilon}\\xi,\\ldots ,    p_{\\epsilon}^{h_p}\\xi\\right]^t$ ] which leads to @xmath204^t_{h_un\\times    n}$ ] , where @xmath205 are polynomial functions of @xmath90 and @xmath206 . due to the symmetry of @xmath90 and @xmath206 , @xmath207",
    "are also symmetric .",
    "analogously , @xmath208 , where @xmath209 are polynomial functions of @xmath90 . due to the symmetry of @xmath90 , @xmath210",
    "are also symmetric , thus @xmath211 contains @xmath212 symmetric matrices @xmath213 and @xmath214_{n\\times h_u    n}(p_{ue}^tqp_{ue}+r)^{-1}=-\\left[\\varphi_{1,1}(p_{\\epsilon}),\\ldots,\\varphi_{1,h_u}(p_{\\epsilon})\\right]$ ] .",
    "accordingly , it is easy to see from ( [ eq : pmpc ] ) that @xmath215 .",
    "since @xmath216 and @xmath217 are both symmetric , one has that @xmath86 is also symmetric .",
    "this completes the proof of the property 2 ) in _ theorem  [ th : eigenvalue conservation]_.      _ necessity _ : ( [ eq : lemma3 - 1 ] ) @xmath218 _ a1 _ and _ a3 _ ( see @xcite ) .    notice that @xmath219 exists if and only if there is a non - singular matrix @xmath220 such that @xmath221t^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath222 is a convergent matrix , i.e. @xmath223 .",
    "one then has that @xmath224t^{-1}\\\\=t\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } i_{m}&\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\mathbf{0}&\\mathbf{0}\\end{array}\\right]t^{-1}=\\sum_{i=1}^m\\gamma_i \\zeta_i,\\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are columns of @xmath220 and rows of @xmath227 , respectively .",
    "since each @xmath228 is a rank - one matrix and @xmath229 has rank @xmath4 , the matrix @xmath230 must have rank @xmath231 .",
    "comparing ( [ eq : lemma3 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : proof wk ] ) gives @xmath232 and @xmath233 , which implies that both @xmath234 and @xmath235 are multiples of @xmath100 .",
    "in other words , @xmath121 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath120 and @xmath100 is its associated left and also right eigenvectors , i.e. _ assumptions _",
    "a1 _ _ and _ a3 _ hold .    _",

    "let @xmath237 be the columns of @xmath220 and @xmath238 be the rows of @xmath227 .",
    "then , we have @xmath239t^{-1}\\\\=t\\left[\\begin{array}{cc }        1&\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\mathbf{0}&\\mathbf{0}\\end{array}\\right]t^{-1}=\\gamma_1    \\zeta_1.\\end{array}\\ ] ] it can be seen from _ assumption a1 _ and the jordan canonical form @xcite that @xmath234 and @xmath235 can be selected as normalized column eigenvector @xmath240 and row eigenvector @xmath241 , respectively ( note that @xmath234 and @xmath235 are not unique , but their product is unique ) , which implies ( [ eq : lemma3 - 1 ] ) immediately .",
