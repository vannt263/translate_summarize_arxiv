    "the interest in this question stems from various sources .",
    "when @xmath22 is fixed ( typically @xmath23 ) this is a version of the _ gibbs conditional principle _ which has been studied extensively for fixed @xmath24 , therefore under a _",
    "large deviation _ condition .",
    "diaconis and freedman @xcite have considered this issue also in the case @xmath25 for @xmath26 , in connection with de finetti s theorem for exchangeable finite sequences .",
    "their interest was related to the approximation of the density of @xmath27 by the _ product density _ of the summands @xmath28 s , therefore on the permanence of the independence of the @xmath28 s under conditioning .",
    "their result is in the spirit of van camperhout and cover vancamperhoutcover1981 and to be paralleled with csiszar s csiszar1084 asymptotic conditional independence result , when the conditioning event is @xmath29 with @xmath10 fixed and larger than @xmath30 . in the same vein and under the same _ large deviation _",
    "condition dembo and zeitouni dembozeitouni1996 considered similar problems .",
    "this question is also of importance in statistical physics .",
    "numerous papers pertaining to structural properties of polymers deal with this issue , and we refer to den hollander and weiss @xcite and @xcite for a description of those problems and related results . in the moderate deviation case ermakov @xcite also considered a similar problem when @xmath31    approximation of conditional densities is the basic ingredient for the numerical estimation of integrals through improved monte carlo techniques .",
    "rare event probabilities may be evaluated through importance sampling techniques ; efficient sampling schemes consist in the simulation of random variables under a proxy of a conditional density , often pertaining to conditioning events of the form @xmath32 ; optimizing these schemes has been a motivation for this work .    in parametric statistical inference conditioning on",
    "the observed value of a statistics leads to a reduction of the mean square error of some estimate of the parameter ; the celebrated rao - blackwell and lehmann - scheff theorems can be implemented when a simulation technique produces samples according to the distribution of the data conditioned on the value of some observed statistics . in these applications",
    "the conditioning event is local and when the statistics is of the form @xmath33 then the observed value @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 such is the case in exponential families when @xmath33 is a sufficient statistics for the parameter .",
    "other fields of applications pertain to parametric estimation where conditioning by the observed value of a sufficient statistics for a nuisance parameter produces optimal inference through maximum likelihood in the conditioned model ; in general this conditional density is unknown ; the approximation produced in this paper provides a tool for the solution of these problems .    both for importance sampling and for the improvement of estimators ,",
    "the approximation of the conditional density of @xmath27 on long runs should be of a very special form : it has to be a density on @xmath36 , easy to simulate , and the approximation should be sharp . for these applications the relative error of the approximation should be small on the simulated paths only .  also for inference through maximum likelihood under nuisance parameter",
    "the approximation has to be accurate on the sample itself and not on the entire space .",
    "our first set of results provides a very sharp approximation scheme ; numerical evidence on exponential runs with length @xmath37 provide a _ relative error _ of the approximation of order less than 100% for the density of the first 800 terms when evaluated on the sample paths themselves , thus on the significant part of the support of the conditional density ; this very sharp approximation rate is surprising in such a large dimensional space , and it illustrates the fact that the conditioned measure occupies a very small part of the entire space .",
    "therefore the approximation of the density of @xmath27 is not performed on the sequence of entire spaces @xmath8 but merely on a sequence of subsets of @xmath38 which bear the trajectories of the conditioned random walk with probability going to @xmath39 as @xmath1 tends to infinity ; the approximation is performed on _",
    "typical paths_.    the extension of our results from typical paths to the whole space @xmath40 holds : convergence of the relative error on large sets imply that the total variation distance between the conditioned measure and its approximation goes to @xmath41 on the entire space .",
    "so our results provide an extension of diaconis and freedman @xcite and dembo and zeitouni @xcite who considered the case when @xmath22 is of small order with respect to @xmath42 the conditions which are assumed in the present paper are weaker than those assumed in the just cited works ; however , in contrast with their results , we do not provide explicit rates for the convergence to @xmath41 of the total variation distance on @xmath43 .",
    "it would have been of interest to consider sharper convergence criteria than the total variation distance ; the @xmath44-distance , which is the mean square relative error , can not be bounded through our approach on the entire space @xmath8 , since it is only handled on large sets of trajectories ( whose probability goes to @xmath39 an @xmath1 increases ) ; this is not sufficient to bound its expected value under the conditional sampling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the approximation scheme for the conditional density of @xmath27 under the point conditioning sequence @xmath45 in section 3 , it is extended to the case when the conditioning family of events writes @xmath46 the value of @xmath22 for which this approximation is fair is discussed ; an algorithm for the implementation of this rule is proposed .",
    "algorithms for the simulation of random variables under the approximating scheme are also presented .",
    "section 4 extends the results of section 3 when conditioning on large sets .",
    "two applications are presented in section 5 ; the first one pertains to rao blackwellization of estimators , hence on the application of the results of section 3 when the point condition is such that @xmath47 ; in the second application the result of section 4 is used to derive small variance estimators of rare event probabilities through importance sampling ; in this case the conditioning event is in the range of the large deviation scale .",
