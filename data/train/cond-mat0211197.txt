    "nonequilibrium , many - body systems were usually regarded as one of the classical domains of physics .",
    "however , recently is is becoming clear that such systems are of interest also in other disciplines such as biology  @xcite , economy  @xcite , or sociology  @xcite .",
    "consequently , notions of cooperative effects , formation of order or phase transition , which were typically restricted to physics , proliferate other scientific disciplines .",
    "an example of multidisciplinary problem , which has application both in biological population dynamics and in hetero- or homogeneous catalysis , is the existence of temporarily periodic solutions in the so - called prey - predator systems .",
    "a closely related problem is synchronization , which appears in various biological contexts such as heart beats , wake - sleep cycles and many other  @xcite .",
    "earliest mathematical model of the temporal oscillations in interacting populations was proposed by lotka and volterra , who described populations of preys and predators in terms of nonlinear differential equations  @xcite .",
    "however , description of interacting populations in terms of ordinary differential equations , by necessity , introduces considerable simplifications .",
    "in particular it neglects fluctuations and spatial inhomogeneities which are certainly present in such systems .",
    "one possibility to take such effects into account is to describe such systems using lattice models .",
    "the first approach of this kind was made by chat and manneville  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , more complicated versions of their model were studied  @xcite .",
    "although in some cases these studies confirmed existence of periodic in time solutions , these models were driven by synchronous dynamics .",
    "more realistic models with asynchronous dynamics were also examined  @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , closely related models are studied in the context of catalysis  @xcite .",
    "on general grounds one expects that fluctuations in low - dimensional systems are strong enough to destroy such temporal oscillations in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an important question is : what is the critical dimension @xmath0 above which such oscillations will survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "certain arguments were given by grinstein et al .",
    "that @xmath1  @xcite . numerical results for both synchronous  @xcite and asynchronous models  @xcite seem to confirm that temporal oscillations exist but only for @xmath2 .",
    "recently , however , numerical simulations by rosenfeld et al . suggest that in a model with smart preys and predators oscillatory behaviour might exist even in @xmath3 systems  @xcite .",
    "they argued that the oscillatory phase is induced by a certain dynamical percolation transition .",
    "if this percolative mechanism would be of more general validity , then the oscillatory phase should exist also in other two - dimensional models .",
    "one would then argue that the fact that this phase was not observed in some earlier simulations  @xcite was due to for example too small range of interactions of preys and predators .    in the present paper",
    "we examine two - dimensional versions of a prey - predator model  @xcite for the increased range of interaction .",
    "however , our simulations show that even with the increased range of interaction , an amplitude of oscillations vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us notice that in three - dimensional version of the model , oscillations exists even for the nearest - neighbour interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus , our result strongly indicates that , at least for our model , there are no oscillations in the case @xmath3 .",
    "usually lattice prey - predator models have an absorbing state .",
    "consequently , they might undergo a phase transition in the steady state between active and absorbing phases , which is expected to belong to the directed percolation universality class  @xcite .",
    "our model is characterized by two absorbing states .",
    "however , these states are asymmetric and only one of them is typically reached by the model s dynamics .",
    "the second absorbing state can be considered as dynamically unstable . because of this asymmetry the model behaves as if it has only one absorbing state and thus should exhibit directed percolation criticality , which was confirmed for the one - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "critical behaviour of models with absorbing states can be studied using the so - called dynamical monte carlo method  @xcite . in this method",
    "we prepare the system in an absorbing state and locally activate it .",
    "statistics of such runs provides a very efficient method to study the critical behaviour of such models .",
    "this method was already applied to a number of models with a single absorbing state or with double but symmetric ones  @xcite .",
    "we are , however , not aware of studies for models with asymmetric absorbing states .",
    "we show that when dynamical simulations start from an unstable absorbing state they suffer from metastable - like effects , which in the two - dimensional case renders the method inefficient . in the one - dimensional case",
    "this effect is much weaker and both absorbing states can be used to extract information about the critical point .    in section",
    "ii we define the model , briefly mention the results of the simple mean - filed approximations , and study the fluctuations of densities of populations . in section",
    "iii we present the results of the dynamical monte carlo method .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "in our model on each site of a @xmath4-dimensional cartesian lattice of linear size @xmath5 we have a four - state variable @xmath6 , which corresponds to the site being empty ( @xmath7 ) , occupied by a prey ( @xmath8 ) , occupied by a predator ( @xmath9 ) or occupied by a prey and a predator ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "dynamics of this model is specified as follows  @xcite : + ( i ) choose a site at random ( say @xmath11-th ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) with the probability @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) update a prey at the chosen site , provided that there is one ( i.e. , @xmath8 or 3 ) ; otherwise do nothing . provided that at least one neighbour of the chosen site is not occupied by a prey ( ie . ,",
    "@xmath7 or 2 ) , the prey ( which is to be updated ) produces one offspring and places it on the empty neighbouring site ( if there are more empty sites , one of them is chosen randomly ) . otherwise ( i.e. , when there is a prey on each neighbouring site ) the prey does not breed ( due to overcrowding ) .",
    "+ ( iii ) with the probability @xmath14 update a predator at the chosen site , provided that there is one ( i.e. , @xmath9 or 3 ) .",
    "provided that the chosen site is occupied by a predator but is not occupied by a prey ( @xmath9 ) , the predator dies ( of hunger ) .",
    "if there is a prey on that site ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) , the predator survives and consumes the prey from the site it occupies .",
    "if there is at least one neighbouring site which is not occupied by a predator , the predator produces one offspring and places it on the empty site ( chosen randomly when there are more such sites ) .",
    "+ to complete the description of this model we have to specify what are the neighbouring sites , i.e. , sites where offsprings can be placed . in previous studies of this model",
    "these were just nearest neighbours  @xcite . in the present paper of our main concern",
    "are @xmath3 models with further ( but finite ) range .",
    "steady - state description of our model is given in terms of densities of preys @xmath15 and predators @xmath16 defined as @xmath17 where summation is over all @xmath18 sites @xmath11 and @xmath19 is kronecker s @xmath19-function . from the above rules it follows that the model has two absorbing states .",
    "the first one ( prey ) is filled with preys ( @xmath20 ) and the second one ( empty ) is empty ( @xmath21 ) . for large enough @xmath12 , both populations coexist and the model is in the active phase ( @xmath22 ) . when the update rate of preys @xmath12 decreases , their number become to small to support predators . for",
    "sufficiently small @xmath12 predators die out and the system quickly reaches the absorbing state prey .",
    "in the simplest case , when the neighbouring sites are nearest neighbours , the phase transition between active and absorbing phase was observed at positive @xmath12 for @xmath23  @xcite . for @xmath24 ( linear chain )",
    "monte carlo simulations show that , as expected , the phase transition belongs to the directed percolation universality class .    to get additional insight into the behaviour of the model",
    "we can use a mean - field approximation . in its simplest",
    "version one describes the model solely in terms of densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( which are strictly speaking time averages quantities defined in eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) ) . from the dynamics of the model and typical mean - field assumptions",
    "one can easily arrive at the following equations  @xcite : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of neighbouring sites ( see the dynamical rule ( ii ) and ( iii ) ) .",
    "predictions of such an approximation is , however , substantially different from the behaviour of the model as observed in monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , approximation ( [ mfaa])-([mfab ] ) fails to predict a phase transition between active and absorbing phases at positive @xmath12 and for any dimension .",
    "moreover , there is no indication of the oscillatory phase as observed in the @xmath28 case .",
    "an improved version of the mean - field approximation can be obtained introducing a third variable @xmath29 , which denotes a density of sites occupied by a prey and a predator ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "then , the mean - field equations are written as : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 in the approximation ( [ mfaa])-([mfab ] ) the density of sites that are occupied by a prey and a predator is simply given by the product @xmath33 . in the approximation ( [ mfa1a])-([mfa1 ] ) this is an independent variable , whose time evolution follows from the dynamical rules of the model .",
    "numerical solution of ( [ mfa1a])-([mfa1 ] ) shows that this approximation is indeed more accurate  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it predicts that for @xmath34 ( which could be interpreted as @xmath35 ) there is a range of @xmath12 in the active phase where nonvanishing oscillations exist . for @xmath36 ( i.e. , square lattice )",
    "this is still at odd with monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that both monte carlo simulations and mean - field calculations are essentially independent on the initial configuration ( provided , of course , we do not start from an absorbing state ) .    to examine the oscillatory behaviour",
    ", one can measure the standard deviation of the densities defined as @xmath37 and analogously for the densities of predators @xmath16 .",
    "the symbol @xmath38 , denotes time average in the steady state .",
    "it was found that for @xmath39 @xmath40 always decreases to zero for @xmath41  @xcite . however , for @xmath28 there is a certain range of @xmath12 in the active phase and such that @xmath42 remains finite for @xmath39 .",
    "such a behaviour indicates that finite - amplitude oscillations survive in the thermodynamic limit .    to check , whether an increased range of interactions might stabilize oscillations in two - dimensional systems , we simulated our model on the triangular lattice and on the lattice with 8 neighbours ( square lattice with nearest- and next - nearest neighbours ) . on such lattices the parent site that is supposed to breed looks for an empty site among 6 or 8 neighbouring sites , respectively . on such lattices",
    "we also observed a phase transition into absorbing phase around @xmath43 .",
    "similarly to other lattices  @xcite , for @xmath12 larger but close to the transition point fluctuations of densities exhibit oscillatory - like behaviour .",
    "however , analysis of the variance of this fluctuations shows ( see fig .",
    "[ sigmatr ] and fig .",
    "[ sigmaos ] ) that in the thermodynamic limit amplitude of oscillations vanishes .",
    "simulations were made for @xmath44 and simulation time was long enough to ensure that error bars are smaller than the plotted symbols .",
    "let us notice that for the lattice with 8 neighbours the coordination number is greater that in the three - dimensional ( cubic lattice ) case . while in the former case oscillations die out in the thermodynamic limit , they survive in the latter one  @xcite .",
    "it indicates that in two - dimensional systems oscillations are unlikely .",
    "however , such a conclusion , if true , is applicable only to models equipped with local dynamics .    one factor which is omitted in our approach is diffusion .",
    "our organisms diffuse only effectively through the breeding process .",
    "in related two - dimensional models , which were studied in the context of heterogeneous catalysis , diffusion was taken into account  @xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that as long as the diffusion constant is finite , the amplitude of oscillations vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the essence of this method is to prepare the system in an absorbing state and to activate it locally  @xcite .",
    "quantities of the main interest are the probability @xmath45 that the activity did not die out until time @xmath46 ( the unit of time is defined as a single , on average , update of each site ) and the average number of active sites @xmath47 ( averaged over all runs ) .",
    "one expects , that at criticality these quantities have the power - law behaviour : @xmath48 , where @xmath19 , and @xmath49 are critical exponents characteristic to a given universality class . off",
    "the critical point @xmath45 and @xmath47 deviate from the power - law behaviour .",
    "we applied the dynamical monte carlo method to the two - dimensional model with nearest neighbour interactions ( square lattice ) . in this case",
    "the steady - state calculations show that the model undergoes a transition at @xmath50 .",
    "our results in the case of the absorbing state prey are shown in fig .",
    "[ lognfinal]-fig .",
    "[ logpfinal ] . as an initial configuration",
    "we put all sites in a prey state ( @xmath8 ) , except a one , randomly selected , site which is in a prey - predator state ( @xmath10 ) . actually , in our model there are two quantities which scale approximately in the same way , namely , the number of predators and the number of active sites ( a site is active if it contains a predator , a prey and predator or a prey which is surrounded by at least one site without a prey ) . to calculate @xmath45 and @xmath47 we considered only the number of predators (",
    "when this number becomes zero we stop a given trial ) but qualitatively the same results are obtained when the number of active sites is considered . using dynamical monte carlo method it is important to ensure that the spreading activity do not reach the boundary of the system .",
    "we checked that the value which we used ( @xmath51 ) was sufficiently large . from the behaviour of @xmath45 and @xmath47",
    "we conclude that the phase transition is located at @xmath52 , which is far more accurate than the steady - state estimation .",
    "moreover , one can see that our data upon approaching the critical point have a power - law behaviour with exponents consistent with ( 2 + 1 ) directed percolation  @xcite .",
    "now , let us apply the dynamical monte carlo in the case of the empty absorbing state .",
    "as an initial configuration we put all sites in an empty state ( @xmath7 ) , except a one , randomly selected , site which is in a prey - predator state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ptpusty]-fig .",
    "[ ntpusty ] . in these simulations",
    "the system is in the active phase ( @xmath53 ) and relatively far from the critical point .",
    "although the survival probability @xmath45 saturates for large @xmath46 its asymptotic values are very low ( fig .",
    "[ ptpusty ] ) .",
    "for example , to confirm with this method that for @xmath54 the system is in the active phase tens of millions of runs must be made .",
    "the reason for that is that for most of the runs predators die out very quickly .",
    "only very few runs generate sufficiently many preys which can support the population of predators .",
    "if the population of predators survives for a certain time , then , most likely , it will survive for an infinitely long time spreading through the system ( see fig .",
    "[ ntpusty ] ) .",
    "we expect that such a behaviour exists for any @xmath53",
    ". however , for @xmath12 close to @xmath55 the long - time survival events are extremely unlikely , which renders this method inefficient .",
    "our model in this case resembles a metastable system  @xcite .",
    "such a system can exit the metastable state only through formation of a sufficiently large seed of the stable phase . in our case",
    "the empty absorbing state corresponds for @xmath53 to a metastable state .",
    "only when a sufficiently large island of the active state occurs , the system is irreversibly driven toward the active ( stable ) state .",
    "however , this metastable effect is much weaker in one - dimensional systems . in this case",
    "the critical point is at @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "dynamical monte carlo simulations for both prey and empty absorbing states are relatively efficient ( see fig .  [ dynd1 ] ) . in the case of the empty absorbing state",
    "only a mild decrease of @xmath47 is seen for small @xmath46 .",
    "we do not fully understand why metastability is much weaker in the @xmath24 case .",
    "most likely it is due to a much easier formation of a sufficiently large seed of a stable phase .",
    "outward spreading of such an active seed resembles a biased random walk and thus grows steadily in time . in the @xmath3 case ,",
    "the formation and growth of the active seed is more complicated .",
    "in the present paper we studied oscillatory and dynamical properties of the two - dimensional prey - predator systems .",
    "our results show that even for the increased range of interactions an amplitude of oscillations vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it might suggests , as found by grinstein et al . in a related context",
    "@xcite , that oscillations might persist but only for @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to that , we examined the validity and efficiency of the dynamical monte carlo method for a model with two asymmetric absorbing states .",
    "it turns out that for an unstable absorbing state in the two - dimensional system this method is very inefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "both absorbing states can be used within this method in a one - dimensional model .",
