    "a large number of particles distributed among two different modes , for example , enables one to perform a full quantum double - slit experiment in a single experimental run @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that fluctuations in the interference patterns can probe interesting characteristics of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "interference is an interesting example of a property that _ weakly _ depends on the choice of the state of the system . in a two - mode system ,",
    "second - order - interference properties are similar as far as one considers a number state or a phase state @xcite , while first - order properties are very different .",
    "these features explain why an interference pattern can be experimentally observed in single experimental runs by measuring the particles positions @xcite , although in the case of number states the offset of the pattern fluctuates randomly , so that averaging over a few experimental runs yields a flat density profile .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , when the number of particles is large , there are interference - related observables whose experimental measurement yields the same result at each run with overwhelming probability  @xcite .",

    ", we shall apply the notion of typicality to a two - mode bose system with a fixed number of particles .",
    "we will study the properties of observables with respect to uniform sampling of a suitable hilbert subspace .",
    "an observable will be defined typical if each experimental run , performed on _ any _ state of the subspace , would yield the same result with overwhelming probability .",
    "according to the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics , the expectation value of an observable provides information on the average of experimental runs on the ( pure or mixed ) state .",
    "we shall build on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and prove that if the observable is typical , there exists an expectation value that contains information on ( almost ) each single experimental run , rather than on the average result .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec - typicality ]",
    "we specify the properties of the statistical ensemble and introduce the general formalism , which leads to the definition of typicality of an observable . in section [ sec : fluctgen ] an analysis of the structure of fluctuations for a general @xmath0-particle observable is performed .",
    "quantitative criteria will be given to determine typicality and obtain informations on higher - order fluctuations .",
    "section [ sec : correlations ] includes an application of typicality criteria to density correlation operators , with the case study of counterpropagating plane - wave modes and an extension to expanding modes in the far - field regime .",
    "let us consider a system of bosons , without internal degrees of freedom .",

    "we are assuming that @xmath4 is even for simplicity , but this specification is immaterial in the large-@xmath4 limit . in a second - quantized formalism",

    "the number operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 count the numbers of particles in each mode .",
    "we are interested in the properties of an ensemble of states randomly sampled from the @xmath16-dimensional subspace @xmath17 spanned by the fock states with @xmath18 ( @xmath16 is odd for simplicity . )",
    "the case @xmath19 represents a degenerate ensemble in which only the state @xmath20 has nonvanishing probability @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the large-@xmath16 case @xcite .",
    "if a bec made up on @xmath4 particles is  evenly \" split between the two modes , one expects @xmath21 .",
    "however , more general cases are possible @xcite . in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath22 the assumption of _ uniform _ sampling is clearly a simplifying one : the number of states that are involved in the description and their amplitudes depends on the experimental procedure , yielding the separation of the condensate in the two modes @xcite .",
    "however , it will emerge that our main results are qualitatively unchanged for a large and relevant class of probability distributions on @xmath23 .",
    "the average of the projection on a random vector state @xmath24 uniformly sampled on @xmath23 yields the ( microcanonical ) density matrix @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the projection onto the subspace @xmath23 . in the following",

    "( [ rhon ] ) is superfluous and can be dispensed with , in accord with the prescription of ockham s razor . in this respect , it is worth stressing that no hypothesis of decoherence will be made and if one wants one can safely assume that in each experimental run a wave function describes the condensate , which is therefore in a pure state .",

    ", the asymptotic condition @xmath33 for @xmath34 , ensures that in the overwhelming majority of cases the experimental measurement of the observable @xmath28 will fluctuate within an extremely narrow range around the average expectation value @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the outcome of a measurement of @xmath28 is almost always the same ( and it equals its average ) for every experimental run in the ensemble .",
    "we call this property _ typicality of the observable_.    in the following sections we will define and characterize conditions for a @xmath0-particle observable to be typical , and analyze in detail the case of spatial correlation functions , which are related to interference .",
    "in a second quantization formalism , the field operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be used to build up many - body observables @xcite .",
    "the simplest ones are the hermitian @xmath38-point functions @xmath39 following eq .",
    "( [ expgen ] ) , one can observe that the ensemble average of @xmath40 can be computed for any @xmath16 once its expectation value over the @xmath4-particle - two - mode fock states @xmath41 is known .",
    "thus , when the field operators in ( [ gk ] ) are expanded in orthogonal modes , only the terms formed by operators associated to modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are relevant in @xmath42 . moreover ,",
    "operator products with a different number of @xmath43 s and @xmath44 s ( respectively @xmath45 s and @xmath46 s ) give vanishing contributions to @xmath47 . the relevant terms in ( [ gk ] ) can be reordered to be expressed as number operators @xmath48 .",

    ".    an important class of @xmath0-particle observables can be obtained by integrating the @xmath57-point functions , for @xmath58 , with a multiplicative kernel @xmath59 : . ]",
    "@xmath60 the ensemble average of @xmath28 can be immediately computed inserting the general results ( [ avgk ] ) .",
    "thus , since @xmath61 when @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 in order to study the behavior of the variance ( [ deltahata ] ) and determine whether @xmath64 is typical or not , we should compute its square , which involves at the highest order in @xmath4 a product of @xmath40 functions , that can be recast into a single @xmath65-point function by normal - ordering the field operators : @xmath66 from  ( [ ak])-([aksquare ] ) we get an expression for the variance @xmath67 with @xmath68 that depends only on the ensemble averages of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . notice that the order @xmath71 comes both from contributions in ( [ ak ] ) with @xmath72 and from normal ordering .",
    "our aim is to find whether , for some choice of the sampled hilbert subspace @xmath23 , the standard deviation ( [ deltaak ] ) is of smaller order with respect to the average @xmath73 in the asymptotic @xmath34 regime .",
    "this behavior is in accord with the definition of typicality of the observable @xmath64 given in sec .",
    "[ sec - typicality ] .",
    "first , let us observe that , since @xmath42 is polynomial in @xmath4 and @xmath16 , inserting the general result ( [ avgk ] ) into @xmath74 yields a polynomial function of degree @xmath38 in the number of particles and the dimension of the sampled subspace : @xmath75 due to the symmetry of the summand around @xmath76 , only terms @xmath77 with _ even _",
    "@xmath78 are present in ( [ deltaakpoly ] ) .",
    "it is evident that , as far as @xmath79 , it is necessary and sufficient for @xmath64 to be typical that @xmath80 vanish , namely , @xmath81 in this case , since @xmath82 , the relative fluctuations are @xmath83 fluctuations that scale like @xmath84 , related to normal ordering and to the very definition of @xmath64 , are ensemble - independent , in the sense that they are present even in degenerate distributions of states . linear fluctuations in @xmath16 are clearly related to the dimension of the sampled subspace , and therefore strongly depend on the definition of the ensemble .",
    "it is interesting to note that , if @xmath85 , two qualitative regimes can be distinguished : i ) when @xmath86 , the relative fluctuations scale like @xmath84 ; ii ) while if @xmath87 , they asymptotically vanish like @xmath88 , i.e.  more slowly .",
    "this reasoning is based on the assumption that @xmath89 does not vanish : we will see in the following how this condition can be checked and discuss in the next section a relevant class of exceptions .    due to the form of the symmetrized products of wave functions ( [ phim ] )",
    ", the typicality condition  ( [ eq : typcond ] ) can be recast in a more convenient form : in particular , we can dispose of the integral over @xmath38 variables by observing that the functions @xmath90 can be decomposed as @xmath91 this result is related to the cluster decomposition principle in bose systems  @xcite . when one computes the square modulus @xmath92 of ( [ clusters ] ) , that enters the variance in ( [ gammak ] ) , the term @xmath93 appears .",
    "this contribution exactly cancels with the subtracted terms in ( [ gammak ] ) , since it can be obtained by a change of summation indices @xmath94 accordingly , a compact form of the typicality condition  ( [ eq : typcond ] ) reads @xmath95 where the coefficients @xmath96 are integrals over @xmath0 position variables of products of the type @xmath97 : @xmath98 given the integral kernel @xmath99 , which determines the highest order in @xmath4 of the observable @xmath64 , and the mode wave functions @xmath100 , it is sufficient to compute the integrals ( [ inti ] ) to check whether the observable is typical .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze the structure of @xmath89 , also in view of the following discussion on spatial correlation function . if @xmath89 in nonvanishing , the transition between an ensemble - independent @xmath101 and an ensemble - dependent behavior of fluctuations occurs for @xmath102 . in order to analyze this quantity ,",
    "one should take into account terms of order @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the general expression ( [ avgk ] ) @xmath105 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + o(n^{k-1})+ o(n^{k-4}n^4 ) ,    \\label{gkbar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to be used in the computation of ( [ gammak ] ) .",

    "thus , it can vanish if the mode structure is properly chosen .",
    "in particular , it vanishes when the @xmath109 s are invariant with respect to exchange of the two mode wave functions : @xmath110 this condition is always valid in a ",
    "double - slit \" bec interference experiment @xcite , where the two modes are identically prepared ( within experimental accuracy ) and then let to interfere .",
    "it is easy to check that the above condition is satisfied whenever @xmath111 at all points . in turn",
    ", this is a consequence of the invariance of @xmath109 under local phase transformations @xmath112 .",
    "in this section we will specialize the general results obtained for an observable of the form ( [ ak ] ) to a particular class , related to the spatial interference of condensates .",
    "this is usually accessible to experimentalists and provides an interesting example of typical behavior .",
    "we shall analyze the integrated density correlation functions @xmath113 where @xmath114 . in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ ak ] ) , it is clear from the normal - ordered form that the highest - order integral kernel for this class of observables is @xmath115 the singularities arising in the normal ordering of ( [ ck ] ) can be avoided by smearing all densities around the points @xmath116 with functions that take into account the finite experimental spatial resolution .",
    "we will focus on two modes that are paradigmatic in the description of interference of bose - eisntein condensates , namely two counterpropagating plane waves @xmath117 and eventually extend the results to the case of two modes that are spatially separated at the initial time , and are let to expand and overlap : this is a more realistic description of the experiments .    in order to satisfy the typicality condition ( [ typ2 ] ) ,",
    "it is generally not necessary that the @xmath107 integrals themselves vanish .",
    "however , in this case we can verify the stronger condition that all the integrals with @xmath118 are identically zero .",
    "let us compute the general form of these integrals by using ( [ ckernel ] ) @xmath119 and consider for definiteness @xmath120 . in this case , the function @xmath121 is the sum of products of @xmath0 mode wave functions and @xmath0 complex conjugates , with the number of @xmath122 s exceeding the number of @xmath123 s by@xmath124 .",
    "the structure of the products reads @xmath125 with @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which implies @xmath129 for all products in @xmath97 .",
    "for the plane - wave modes ( [ waves ] ) , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . inserting these results in the general form of the products ( [ prodc ] ) and integrating over @xmath132 as in ( [ intic ] ) yields @xmath133 thus",
    ", all the contributions to the integral ( [ intic ] ) identically vanish for every @xmath0 and every set of points @xmath134 .",
    "this implies that condition @xmath135 is satisfied by all density correlation functions of the form ( [ ck ] ) , which are thus typical for @xmath79 .",
    "the structure of the modes provides interesting information also on the @xmath136 part of the fluctuations , arising from ( [ gammak ] ) and the general expression ( [ gkbar ] ) .",
    "since @xmath137 and @xmath138 are identically equal to one , the mode wave functions satisfy the symmetry condition ( [ fmsymm ] ) for the @xmath109 functions .",
    "this implies that the @xmath139 integrals , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ intj ] ) , indentically vanish , which , together with the cancellation of the @xmath107 integrals , leads to the result @xmath140 thus , the highest order of ensemble - dependent contributions to the variance @xmath141 is indeed @xmath142 , which should be compared with the order @xmath71 of the ensemble - independent fluctuations .",
    "this means that if @xmath85 , the relative fluctuations behave like @xmath143 the transition between an ensemble - independent regime of relative fluctuations to an ensemble - dependent one does not take place , as one would expect , at @xmath144 , but extends up to @xmath145 .",

    "let us consider two spatially separated modes @xmath154 and @xmath155 in one dimension , which are concentrated respectively around positions @xmath156 and @xmath157 , their initial width being much smaller than their distance .",
    "the spatial separation implies that the convolution @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 real functions of @xmath161 , is peaked around a point @xmath162 , while the convolutions of @xmath122 with @xmath123 and of @xmath163 with @xmath164 are peaked around @xmath165 .",

    "are thus related to products of fourier transforms , which can be expressed through the convolution ( [ convol ] ) as @xmath173 using a quadratic approximation of @xmath159 around its maximum @xmath174 , the integral becomes gaussian and the product @xmath172 reads @xmath175 if the spatial period of the complex exponential is much shorter than the standard deviation of the gaussian part , namely @xmath176 the product ( [ psiab ] ) is consistent with the result for counterpropagating plane wave modes with time - dependent wave number @xmath177 , modulated by a slowly - varying gaussian envelope , whose width is of the same order as the standard deviation of the far - field - approximated @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "thus , the integrals of products ( [ prodc ] ) with the kernel ( [ ckernel ] ) are exponentially suppressed like @xmath180 .",
    "this means that when the relation ( [ distance ] ) on the initial wave packets is satisfied , typicality condition ( [ wtyp1 ] ) on correlation functions is fulfilled within a very good level of approximation .    the generalization of the result ( [ wtyp2 ] ) , yielding the cancellation of @xmath136 terms in the variance , can not be extended without further assumptions to the case of expanding modes in the far - field regime .",
    "in fact , the relation @xmath181 might not even be approximately verified in the large - time limit .",
