    "basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) @xcite is a non - perturbative tool for solving bound state problems in quantum field theory .",
    "this hamiltonian - based approach combines the advantages of light - front dynamics @xcite with modern developments in _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations , such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite . in blfq , the quantum field theoretical bound state problem",
    "is formulated as a large , sparse matrix diagonalization problem .",
    "state - of - the - art methods developed for ncsm calculations can then be used to address hadronic systems @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the light - front hamiltonian in a fock - space basis yields the mass eigenstates of the system , along with amplitudes for evaluating non - perturbative observables . here , we extend previous work @xcite on the mass spectrum of positronium in blfq .",
    "we evaluate the spectrum at a strong coupling of @xmath0 to make both the binding energy and hyperfine splitting easier to resolve numerically .",
    "details of the calculations and additional results can be found in ref .",
    "in blfq , hadron observables are evaluated by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy - momentum 4-vector operator and @xmath3 is the invariant mass . in blfq , we express the operator @xmath4 in light - cone gauge .",
    "the operator @xmath4 then plays a role analogous to the hamiltonian operator in non - relativistic quantum mechanics . as such",
    ", it is sometimes referred to as the `` light - cone hamiltonian '' @xmath5 .",
    "( note that in this convention the `` hamiltonian '' has energy squared units . )",
    "this operator can be derived from any field theoretical lagrangian via the legendre transform . in blfq , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound_st ] ) is expressed in a truncated basis , and the resulting finite - dimensional matrix is diagonalized numerically .",
    "one then examines the trends in observables as the basis truncation is relaxed to estimate the results in the infinite matrix ( or `` continuum '' ) limit . in blfq , three separate basis truncations are made .",
    "first , the number of fock sectors in the basis is truncated .",
    "the basis space for the diagonalization in principle includes an infinite set of fock sectors .",
    "for example , the positronium wavefunction could be expressed schematically as @xmath6 here we limit ourselves to only the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sectors .",
    "we do not yet make any attempt to examine the limit of increasing the number of fock sectors .",
    "secondly , we discretize the longitudinal momentum by putting our system in a longitudinal box of length @xmath9 and applying ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "specifically , we choose periodic bcs for bosons and anti - periodic bcs for fermions .",
    "thus @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an integer for bosons , or a half - integer for fermions . for bosons ,",
    "we exclude the `` zero modes '' , i.e. @xmath12 . in the many - body basis , all basis states are selected to have the same total longitudinal momentum @xmath13 , where the sum is over the particles in a particular basis state . we then parameterize @xmath14 using a dimensionless variable @xmath15 such that @xmath16 . for a given particle @xmath17 ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 due to the positivity of longitudinal momenta on the light - front @xcite , fixing @xmath20 also serves as a fock space cutoff and makes the number of longitudinal modes finite @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath20 determines our `` resolution '' in the longitudinal direction , and thus our resolution on parton distribution functions .",
    "the longitudinal continuum limit corresponds to the limit @xmath21 . finally ,",
    "in the transverse direction , we employ a 2d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "the basis functions are the eigenfunctions of the operator ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) @xmath24\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions @xmath25 are characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the energy scale @xmath28 .",
    "the basis is made finite by restricting the number of allowed oscillator quanta in each many - body basis state according to @xmath29 the transverse continuum limit corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , we use an `` m - scheme '' basis .",
    "that is , our many body states have well defined values of the total angular momentum projection @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermion spin , but they do not have a well - defined total angular momentum @xmath33 .    in blfq , we construct our many - body basis in single - particle coordinates",
    ". the rationale for doing this is its straightforward generalization to a basis of many particles . in principle , relative ( jacobi ) coordinates could be used , but this process rapidly becomes intractable as the particle number is increased , due to the need for proper ( anti-)symmetrization of the basis states .",
    "the disadvantage of using single - particle coordinates is that the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion of the system is contained in our solutions .",
    "the use of the ho basis combined with the @xmath34 truncation allows for the exact factorization of the wavefunction into `` intrinsic '' and `` cm '' components , even within a truncated basis .    when the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 , exact cm factorization is achieved for all eigenstates , even in a basis with arbitrary numbers of sectors , which is the reason for the introduction of these coordinates @xcite .",
    "the spurious cm excited states can be removed from the low - lying spectrum by adding a lagrange multiplier proportional to @xmath37 to the hamiltonian to get @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in practice",
    ", one selects @xmath40 to be large enough that @xmath41 is well above the excitation spectrum of interest .",
    "demonstrations of the exact cm factorization within blfq are given in refs .",
    "we truncate the fock space to include only @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "we wish to formulate an effective potential acting only in the @xmath7 space that includes the effects generated by the @xmath8 space .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath42 where states @xmath43 and @xmath44 are states in the @xmath7 space .",
    "the basis states @xmath43 and @xmath44 are eigenstates of the free hamiltonian ( i.e. @xmath45 ) with eigenvalue @xmath46 where the sum runs over particles ( of mass @xmath47 ) in the state @xmath43",
    ". the instantaneous photon exchange term , the two - body interaction @xmath48 , is the only term in the light - cone hamiltonian directly connecting two states within the @xmath7 sector .",
    "we choose the bloch form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian @xcite is given by : @xmath49 .",

    "( [ eq : bloch ] ) which generate the photon exchange .",
    "we neglect the combinations which result in the photon being emitted and absorbed by the same fermion .",
    "that is , we do not incorporate the fermion self - energy , and therefore no fermion mass renormalization is necessary in this model .",
    "in addition , we work with unit - normalized eigenstates and a fixed value of the coupling constant",
    ".    one can show that @xmath48 is completely cancelled by a corresponding term in @xmath50 leaving ( @xmath51 ) @xmath52}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot\\psi_{n_1}^{m_1}(\\mathbf{q}_1)\\psi_{n_2}^{m_2}(\\mathbf{q}_2)\\psi_{n_1'}^{m_1'\\ast}(\\mathbf{q}_1')\\psi_{n_2'}^{m_2'\\ast}(\\mathbf{q}_2 ' ) s_{\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_1',\\alpha_2'}(\\sqrt{x_1}\\mathbf{q}_1,\\sqrt{x_2}\\mathbf{q}_2,\\sqrt{x_1'}\\mathbf{q}_1',\\sqrt{x_2'}\\mathbf{q}_2 ' ) , \\label{eq : heff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath53 to represent the set of discrete quantum numbers @xmath54 and @xmath55 to represent the subset @xmath56 .",

    "@xcite .    in the energy denominator",
    ", we introduce a fictitious photon mass @xmath58 to regulate the expected coulomb singularity that , while integrable , introduces numerical difficulties .",

    "previous studies investigating the problem of positronium on the light - front with a one - photon exchange kernel have noted a small but noticeable dependence on the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory @xcite . both refs .",
    "@xcite state that the origin of this instability can be traced to a particular term in the effective interaction ( or one - photon exchange kernel ) which tends to a non - zero constant ( in momentum space ) at asymptotically large momentum transfer , corresponding to a dirac delta potential in coordinate space .",
    "since the 2d dirac delta potential well has no bound states of finite binding energy @xcite , this leads to a divergence . in our calculation",
    ", this would result in a ground state energy that does not converge with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "if this term is simply dropped , the results become convergent .",
