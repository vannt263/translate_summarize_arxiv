    "a spatial point pattern is often studied by estimating point process characteristics such as the empty space function @xmath0 , the nearest - neighbour distance distribution function @xmath1 , and the @xmath9-function .",
    "here we consider @xmath11 as advocated by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 function is identically equal to 1 for a poisson process , and values of @xmath12 less than or greater than 1 are suggestive of clustering or regularity , respectively .",
    "( note that it is of course possible to find non - poisson point processes for which @xmath13 , as @xcite have shown ) .    in practice ,",
    "observation of the point process is usually restricted to some bounded window @xmath3 . as a consequence , estimation of the summary functions , which is based on the measurement of various distances of the point process ,",
    "is hampered by the `` edge effects '' ( bias and censoring ) introduced by restricting observation of these distances to @xmath3 . in order to counter edge effects",
    "it is necessary to apply some form of edge correction to the empirical estimates of the summary functions . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "unbiasedness is highly desirable when a summary function estimate is to be compared directly to the corresponding theoretical value for a point process model .",
    "however , as diggle argues in the discussion of @xcite and in @xcite , unbiasedness is not essential when using a summary function estimator as the test statistic in a hypothesis test , since the bias will be accounted for in the null distribution of the test statistic .    this paper studies the _ uncorrected _ estimator of @xmath6 obtained by ignoring edge effects and computing @xmath14 from the uncorrected , empirical distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of distances observed in a compact window .",
    "it was prompted by the accidental discovery that this uncorrected estimator remarkably still yields values @xmath17 approximately equal to 1 for the poisson process .",
    "an intuitive explanation is that the relative bias due to edge effects is roughly equal for the estimates of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so that these biases approximately cancel in the ratio estimator of @xmath6 .",
    "it follows that the uncorrected estimate of @xmath6 could be used for the direct visual assessment of deviations from the poisson process , something not possible with the uncorrected estimates of @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath9 .",
    "our aim is to formalise this uncorrected estimator of @xmath6 , and to investigate its use as a summary statistic and as a test statistic in point pattern analysis .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 outlines and generalises some fundamental point process ideas . in section 3",
    "we define the @xmath20 function estimated by the uncorrected procedure described above and derives some of its properties . in section 4 we verify that the natural estimator of @xmath20 is the uncorrected estimate @xmath5 . finally , section 5 presents the results of a computational experiment to compare the power of monte carlo tests constructed from estimates of @xmath6 and @xmath20 as well as estimation results from the simulations of various point process models in square and rectangular windows in @xmath21 and in a cubic window in @xmath22 .",

    "the empty space function @xmath26 is the probability of finding a point of the process within a radius @xmath27 of an arbitrary fixed point : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the ball of radius @xmath27 centred at @xmath30 .",
    "the nearest neighbour distance distribution function @xmath31 is the probability of finding another point of the process in the ball of radius @xmath27 centred at a `` typical '' point of the process : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the reduced palm distribution at the origin @xmath34 . roughly speaking @xmath33 is the distribution of rest of the process @xmath35",
    "given there is a point of the process at the origin ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ( 4.4.3 ) ) gives @xmath38 in both cases we need information about @xmath39 for @xmath40 , whereas we only observe @xmath41 .",
    "usually this edge effect problem is countered by restricting the integration in ( [ estf ] ) and summation in ( [ estg ] ) to those points @xmath30 for which @xmath42 ( the `` border method '' ) or by weighting the contributions to the integral and sum so as to correct for the bias ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "the uncorrected , empirical distributions of distances observed in the window @xmath3 correspond to simply replacing @xmath23 by @xmath43 in ( [ estf ] ) and ( [ estg ] ) . in order to investigate the effect of this , we extend @xmath0 and @xmath1 to functionals as follows .",
    "[ newfg ] for every compact set @xmath44 containing the origin define @xmath45    ( note that the empty space functional bears some relation to the contact distribution function @xcite in that @xmath46 ) .",

    "[ newjpois ] let @xmath23 be a stationary poisson process .",
    "then @xmath53    explicit evaluation of @xmath20 for other point process models seems difficult .",
    "however , we can show that @xmath20 behaves similarly to the @xmath6 function for ordered and clustered processes , suggesting it can also be interpreted in the same way as the @xmath6 function .",
    "for some processes it is also possible to demonstrate that the @xmath20 function exhibits less deviation from the poisson hypothesis than the equivalent @xmath6 function .",
    "[ bound ] suppose @xmath23 is a process which is `` ordered '' in the sense that its @xmath6 functional is non - decreasing , that is @xmath54 implies @xmath55",

    "let @xmath23 be a neyman - scott cluster process with mean number of points per cluster greater than @xmath8 . assuming the support of the distribution of the cluster points contains a neighbourhood of the origin , then @xmath67    examples of processes satisfying the conditions of proposition [ pns ] are matrn s cluster process and the modified thomas process described , for example , in @xcite .",

    "hence @xmath71 now the assumption on the cluster distribution ensures @xmath72 for all @xmath9 containing a neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "the conclusion then follows since @xmath73 contains a neighbourhood of @xmath34 whenever @xmath30 is an interior point of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a hard - core process with hard - core radius @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 and @xmath76 is non - decreasing in @xmath27 for all @xmath77 .",
    "trivially we have @xmath78 for all @xmath79 , while for any point process the empty space functional @xmath80 is nondecreasing .",
    "therefore the @xmath6 functional becomes @xmath81 which is also non - decreasing and the result follows by proposition [ bound ] .",
    "analogously to @xmath6 we want to estimate @xmath20 by the ratio of two estimators for the denominator and numerator in definition [ myjdefn ] .",

    "thus the uncorrected estimate of the @xmath6 function , based on the uncorrected ( edf ) estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can be thought of as a ratio unbiased estimator of the @xmath20 function .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , the @xmath20 function can be interpreted in the same way as the @xmath6 function .",
    "consequently , the uncorrected estimate of the @xmath6 function , unlike the uncorrected estimates of @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath9 , can be used directly as an interpretive statistic in classifying deviations from the poisson process .",
    "this section reports the results of simulation studies comparing the uncorrected estimator @xmath5 with `` corrected '' estimators @xmath90 . in  [ s : example ] we show the results for a single simulated pattern ;  [ s : mean+var ] reports the means and variances of the estimators of @xmath6 in a simulation study .",
    "these results show that @xmath5 typically has smaller variance than the corrected estimators . in  [ s : test - stat ] and  [ s : power ] we consider the power of hypothesis tests based on the uncorrected estimator @xmath5 .",
    "it is not clear , a priori , whether `` corrected '' estimators @xmath90 or uncorrected estimators @xmath5 will yield more powerful tests .",
    "there are two competing effects : the variance of @xmath5 is smaller than that of @xmath90 , but @xmath20 is less sensitive than @xmath6 to departures from the poisson process ( say ) according to proposition  [ bound ] .    for the comparisons which follow , the reduced sample ( border method ) estimator @xmath91 was adopted .",
    "however , for the purpose of highlighting the variations which exist between corrected estimates of the @xmath6 function , the kaplan - meier estimator @xmath92 ( described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also considered in many cases .",
    "this example highlights the use of @xmath5 as a qualitative summary statistic .",
    "consider the point pattern given in figure [ window ] .",
    "this pattern is a realisation of a matrn cluster process , intensity @xmath93 , cluster radius @xmath94 and mean number of offspring @xmath95 , observed within an observation window consisting of two rectangular windows , 3.125 by 0.16 units , separated by 0.02 units .",
    "( the matrn cluster process is a neyman - scott process in which offspring are uniformly distributed in disc of radius @xmath74 about ( poisson ) parent points .",
    "the number of offspring per parent point is poisson with mean @xmath96 @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ window ] also displays the corresponding estimates @xmath5 and @xmath91 of the given point pattern , together with envelopes of 99 simulations of a binomial process of the same intensity , observed within the same window .",
    "the results in this case are marked ; the uncorrected estimate suggests strong evidence of clustering in the point pattern , while the corrected estimate appears to suggest no evidence of clustering . of course ,",
    "the results are not surprising given the severity of the edge effect introduced by the `` censoring '' of the middle seventeenth of the window compared to the relatively small bias this introduces .",
    "however , it does illustrate the possible benefit of using @xmath5 in certain situations .",
    "> from the previous example it is clear that the uncorrected estimate of the j function may be superior in some situations . to examine whether this was true more generally , a number of simulations were conducted to compare the corrected and uncorrected methods across a range of processes .",
    "this began with the estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the three estimators ( @xmath5 , @xmath92 , and @xmath91 ) based on @xmath98 realisations of a poisson process with intensity @xmath99 , in a unit square window , with the results presented in figure [ meanstdev ] .    with increasing @xmath27 , the distributions of the @xmath100 ( that is",
    ", the estimators @xmath5 , @xmath92 , and @xmath91 ) become skewed to the right ; for large @xmath27 there is substantial mass above @xmath101 . as a result",
    "all three estimators are positively biased for large values of @xmath27 . empirically it was found that a square root transformation approximately symmetrised the distribution .",
    "as expected , the sample standard deviation of the estimates increases with @xmath27 , as the denominator of each estimator decreases with @xmath27 .",
    "however , @xmath5 is less biased and has lower variance than @xmath92 and @xmath91 .",
    "these simulations were repeated for two processes with more substantial edge effects ( namely , a poisson process of intensity @xmath102 in a unit window , and a poisson process of intensity @xmath103 in a @xmath104 by @xmath8 rectangular window ) . in both cases",
    "the results were qualitatively similar to those above .",
    "in addition , further simulations were conducted for point patterns in @xmath22",
    ". estimates of the means and standard deviations of @xmath92 and @xmath91 based on @xmath105 realisations in a unit cube were compared for the poisson process and two alternatives : matrn hard - core @xcite and matrn cluster processes for a range of parameter values .",
    "some of the key results are presented in figure [ cube ] . as expected",
    ", @xmath5 is reliable over a wider domain than @xmath91 .",
    "for hard - core processes , the standard deviation of @xmath91 is considerably bigger than that of @xmath5 and the difference grows with the hard - core radius . for cluster processes the differences are far less apparent",
    ", however the overall tendency of @xmath5 to have lower variance is also confirmed for this class of processes .",
    "note also that with both alternative processes the mean of @xmath5 is bounded by @xmath8 and @xmath91 , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that , unlike the @xmath6 function estimators , the domain of the @xmath20 function estimator for a given point process realisation can be easily calculated .",
    "the @xmath20 estimator is defined for all @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the maximum nearest - point distance ( the largest distance , over all points in the window , from a point to the nearest point of the process ) .",
    "also @xmath108 for any @xmath109 if @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the maximum nearest - neighbour distance ( the largest distance , over all points of the process within the window , from a point of the process to the nearest other point of the process ) .",
    "the value @xmath107 is however an upper bound on the domain of both the reduced sample and kaplan - meier estimators .",
    "we now aim to compare the power of the @xmath112 function with the edge corrected estimators of the @xmath6 function in testing the poisson hypothesis in the two dimensional case .",
    "we restricted ourselves to this estimation problem in view of the problems with estimating the range of interaction using the @xmath6 function reported in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the following test statistic for each of the three estimators was estimated : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the sample standard deviation of @xmath115 under the poisson hypothesis .",
    "this form of test statistic was chosen , as opposed to a squared integrand , because of the skewed nature of the distributions of @xmath100 .",
    "the distributions of the test statistics were estimated by a discrete sum and based on @xmath98 realisations of a poisson process .",
    "the upper limit of integration @xmath116 was chosen to be the 0.9 quantile of the @xmath0 function ( for intensity @xmath99 , @xmath117 ) .",
    "having estimated the distribution , the @xmath118 and @xmath119 quantiles were obtained for use in a two - sided @xmath120 significance test for deviation from a poisson process .",
    "one - sided @xmath120 significance tests were also constructed to test for clustering or regularity by considering the @xmath121 and @xmath122 quantiles , respectively .      in order to estimate the power of the hypothesis test described above",
    ", realisations from alternative point processes were generated and the proportion of the realisations rejected by the hypothesis test was recorded .",
    "the first class of point processes considered was the matrn hard - core process , with hard - core radius @xmath74 .",
    "for each of @xmath123 values of @xmath74 , @xmath105 realisations were generated .",
    "the proportion of rejections is presented in figure [ mmii ] .",
    "note that as @xmath124 the model approaches the poisson process , so we expect all power curves to approach @xmath121 @xmath125 as @xmath124 .",
    "all three estimators have very similar power curves , with the @xmath20 estimator at least as powerful as the two @xmath6 function estimators for all values of @xmath74 .",
    "the other class of alternative point processes considered was matrn s cluster process .",
    "a grid of @xmath126 values was constructed and @xmath105 realisations were obtained from the corresponding matrn cluster process .",
    "the proportion of rejections for each @xmath126 value is presented in figure [ mns ] . once again , the curves are very similar , with all three tests performing almost identically .",
    "similar results were obtained for the respective one - sided tests in both cases as well as for the lower intensity @xmath127 .",
    "the power tests for the @xmath104 by @xmath8 window support the argument that edge effects are stronger when the boundary is relatively longer .",
    "the resulting power function estimates against the matrn model ii and matrn cluster process models are also presented in figures [ mmii ] and [ mns ] , respectively .",
    "one important observation made while conducting these numerical simulations was that the choice of test statistic had far more impact on the power of the resulting hypothesis test than the choice of @xmath6 function estimator . for a comparison of various test statistics of the @xmath6 function see @xcite .      .",
