    "the number of mobile phones actively in use worldwide today is about 5 billion , with millions of new subscribers every day .",
    "mobile phones allow for unobtrusive and cost - effective access to previously inaccessible sources of behavioral data such as location , communications ( calls and text messages ) , photos , videos , apps and internet access @xcite .",
    "hence , a result of the ever - increasing adoption of these devices is the availability of large amounts of _ personal data _ related to habits , routines , social interactions and interests @xcite .",
    "however , the ubiquitous collection of personal data raises unprecedented privacy challenges .",
    "users typically have to make decisions concerning the disclosure of their personal information on the basis of a difficult tradeoff between data protection and the advantages stemming from data sharing .",
    "perhaps more importantly , people are typically not involved in the life - cycle of their own personal data  as it is collected by websites and mobile phone apps , which results in a lack of understanding of who uses their data and for what .",
    "several researchers have proposed and investigated new user - centric models for personal data management , which enable individuals to have more control of their own data s life - cycle @xcite . to this end",
    ", researchers and companies are developing repositories which implement medium - grained access control to different kinds of personally identifiable information ( pii ) , such as _ e.g. _ passwords , social security numbers and health info @xcite , and more recently location @xcite and personal data collected online by means of smartphones or wearable devices @xcite .",
    "previous work has introduced the concept of _ personal data markets _ in which individuals sell their own personal data to entities interested in buying it @xcite .",
    "buyers are likely to be companies and researchers , while sellers are individuals who receive compensation for sharing their own data .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a mechanism called _ transactional _ privacy , devised to maximize both the user s control of their own pii and the utility of a data - driven market .    in the context of prospective personal data markets that offer increased transparency and control , it is of great importance to understand the value that users put to their own pii .",

    "@xcite as an inspiration , in this paper we investigate the monetary value that people assign to different kinds of pii as collected by their mobile phone , including location and communication information .",
    "we carried out a comprehensive 6-week long study in a living lab environment with 60 participants and adopted a day reconstruction method @xcite along with a reverse second price auction mechanism in order to poll and collect honest monetary valuations .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :    1 .",
    "quantitative valuations of mobile pii as collected by a 6-week long study conducted in the wild ; 2 .   qualitative feedback on the valuations provided by each participant as gathered by an end of study ( eos ) survey ; 3 .   a segmentation of pii valuations and findings based on 4 categories of mobile pii ( communications , location , media and apps ) , 3 levels of complexity ( individual , processed , aggregated ) , and one level of temporal granularity ( daily ) ; 4 .   a set of key insights about people s sensitivities and valuations of mobile pii and implications for the design of mobile services that leverage mobile pii .",
    "in recent years , researchers have analyzed the factors that can influence a person s disclosure behavior and economic valuation of personal information .",
    "demographic characteristics , such as gender and age , have been found to affect disclosure attitudes and behavior .",
    "several studies have identified gender differences concerning privacy concerns and consequent information disclosure behaviors : for example , women are generally more protective of their online privacy @xcite .",
    "age also plays a role in information disclosure behaviors : in a study on facebook usage , christofides _",
    "_ @xcite found that adolescents disclose more information .",
    "prior work has also emphasized the role of an individual s stable psychological attributes - _",
    "e.g. _ personality traits - to explain information disclosure behavior .",
    "@xcite explored the role of the big5 personality traits @xcite and found that agreeableness  defined as being sympathetic , straightforward and selfless , has a significant influence on individual concerns for information privacy .",
    "_ @xcite and amichai - hamburger and vinitzky @xcite also used the big5 personality traits and found that agreeableness , conscientiousness , and openness affect a person s concerns for privacy .",
    "however , other studies targeting the influence of personality traits did not find significant correlations @xcite . more recently ,",
    "quercia _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found weak correlations among openness to experience and , to a lesser extent , extraversion and the disclosure attitudes on facebook . in 2010 , lo @xcite suggested that locus of control @xcite could affect an individual s perception of risk when disclosing personal information : internals are more likely than externals to feel that they can control the risk of becoming privacy victims , hence they are more willing to disclose their personal information @xcite .",
    "individual differences are also found when providing economic valuations of personal data @xcite .",
    "for instance , some individuals may not be concerned about privacy and would allow access to their data in exchange for a few cents , whereas others may only consent if well paid .",
    "recently , aperjis and huberman @xcite proposed to introduce a realistic market for personal data that pays individuals for their data while taking into account their own privacy and risk attitudes .",
    "previous research has shown that disclosure @xcite and valuation @xcite depend on the kind of information to be released .",
    "@xcite reported that the valuation of some types of personal information , such as the subject s weight and the subject s age depends on the desirability of these types of information in a social context .",
    "some empirical studies have attempted to quantify subjective privacy valuations of personal information in different contexts , such as personal information revealed online @xcite , access to location data @xcite , or removal from marketers call lists @xcite .",
    "these studies can be classified into two groups .",
    "the first and larger group includes studies that explicitly or implicitly measure the amount of money or benefit that a person considers to be enough to share her / his personal data , namely their _ willingness to accept _ ( wta ) giving away his / her own data ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the second and smaller group includes studies about tangible prices or intangible costs consumers are _ willing to pay _ ( wtp ) to protect their privacy ( see for example , @xcite ) . in our paper , we do not deal with wta vs wtp , but we focus on wta for pii captured by mobile phones ( communications , apps and media usage , locations ) .    a growing body of studies in the fields of ubiquitous and pervasive computing and human - computer interaction focuses on location sharing behavior and has highlighted the role played by the recipient of sharing ( who can access the information ) , the purpose , the context , how the information is going to be used @xcite and the level of granularity of the information shared @xcite .",
    "finally , studies have suggested the importance of analyzing people s actual behavior rather than attitudes expressed through questionnaires because often the actual behavior of people deviates from what they state @xcite .",
    "building upon previous work , in this paper we investigate the monetary value that people assign to different kinds of pii as collected by their mobile phone , including location and communication patterns .",
    "in particular , we carry out a comprehensive 6-week long study in a living lab environment with 60 participants and adopt a day reconstruction method @xcite and a reverse second price auction mechanism in order to poll and collect honest monetary valuations from our sample .",
    "next , we describe the methodology followed during our 6-week study .      the living laboratory where we carried out our study was launched in november of 2012 and it is a joint effort between industrial and academic research institutions .",
    "it consists of a group of more than 100 volunteers who carry an instrumented smartphone in exchange for a monthly credit bonus of voice , sms and data access . the sensing system installed on the smartphones",
    "is based on the funf framework @xcite and logs communication events , location , apps usage and photos shot . in addition , the members of the living lab participate in user - studies carried out by researchers .",
    "the goals of this living lab are to foster research on real - life behavioral analysis obtained by means of mobile devices , and to deploy and test prototype applications in a real - life scenario .",
    "one of the most important features of such a lab is its ecological validity , given that the participants behaviors and attitudes are sensed in the real world , as people live their everyday life , and not under artificial laboratory conditions .",
    "all volunteers were recruited within the target group of young families with children , using a snowball sampling approach where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances @xcite . upon agreeing to the terms of participation , the volunteers granted researchers legal access to their behavioral data as it is collected by their smartphones .",
    "volunteers retain full rights over their personal data such that they can order deletion of personal information from the secure storage servers .",
    "moreover , participants have the choice to participate or not in a given study . upon joining the living lab",
    ", each participant fills out an initial questionnaire which collects their demographics , individual traits and dispositions ( _ e.g. _ big five personality traits , trust disposition , locus of control , etc . ) information .",
    "a total of 60 volunteers from the living lab chose to participate in our mobile personal data monetization study .",
    "participants age ranged from 28 to 44 years old ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "they held a variety of occupations and education levels , ranging from high school diplomas to phd degrees .",
    "all were savvy android users who had used the smartphones provided by the living lab since november 2012 .",
    "regarding their socio - economic status , the average personal net income amounted to  21169 per year ( @xmath2 ) ; while the average family net income amounted to  36915 per year ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "all participants lived in italy and the vast majority were of italian nationality .",
    "our study ran for six weeks from october 28th , 2013 to december 11th , 2013 . at the beginning of the study , participants were explained that the study consisted of three phases :    1 .   an initial questionnaire , which focused on their general perception of privacy and personal data ; 2 .",
    "a daily data collection phase that lasted 6 weeks where participants answered daily surveys to valuate their mobile personal data ; 3 .   a final survey that aimed to clarify the results obtained and to collect qualitative feedback from participants .",

    "the survey questions were generated based on the mobile data collected during the previous day .",
    "everyday , at 12 pm , participants received an sms reminding them to fill out their survey via a personalized url ( through a unique hash ) .    in order to test the live system and identify bugs , we ran a pilot for 10 days with a small set of volunteers who were not participants in the study .",
    "in addition , we allocated a _ training _",
    "week prior to starting the actual study so participants would get accustomed to the survey / auction scheme .",
    "next we describe the data that we collected during the study .",
    "we collected 4 categories of mobile personal data : ( 1 ) _ communications _ , in the form of calls made / received ; ( 2 ) _ locations _ , collected by the device gps sensor every @xmath4 minutes ; ( 3 ) _ running applications _ , sampled every 25 minutes ; and ( 4 ) _ media _ , _ i.e. _ number and timestamp of pictures taken and obtained by monitoring the device file system .",
    "the sampling rates for the different categories of data were empirically determined in order to have good resolution without significantly impacting the device s battery life .    moving from finer to coarser granularity ,",
    "we probed participants about the following three levels of complexity for each category of data : ( 1 ) _ individual _ , encompassing individual data points ( _ e.g. _ a call made / received , a picture taken , a specific gps location ) ; ( 2 ) _ processed _ , depicting higher level information derived from the sensed events ( _ e.g. _ a given application has been running for n minutes , total distance traveled ) ; and ( 3 ) _ aggregated _ , portraying cumulative event information ( _ e.g. _ number of places visited , number of calls made / received ) .    for each data category and level of complexity , participants were asked to fill out daily surveys that asked them about data from the previous day for each category and for a specific level of complexity ( up to 4 questions per day ) . for each question in the surveys , participants always had the option to opt - out and not sell that particular piece of information .",
    "next , we describe in detail the 4 categories and the 3 levels of complexity of mobile personal data that we collected in this study , which are summarized in table  [ tab : features ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      _ individual _ communication data was restricted to voice calls made / received ; missed calls were discarded .",
    "the _ processed _ communication variable referred to the total duration of calls in the previous day , resulting in questions such as ` yesterday , you spoke on the phone for a total of 52 minutes ` .    with respect to _ aggregated _ communications data , we alternated between two different aggregated variables on a weekly basis : on even weeks subjects were asked to monetize information about the total number of calls made / received during the previous day , while on odd weeks they were asked about call diversity , _ i.e. _ the number of different people that they talked to on the phone during the previous day .",
    "examples of questions related to aggregate communications are ` yesterday , you made / received 8 phone calls ` , or ` yesterday , you spoke on the phone with 3 different persons ` .",
    "_ individual _ location referred to a specific place visited by the participant in the previous day .",
    "semantic information associated to gps locations was derived via reverse geo - coding using yahoo query language . for individual locations , details on street , neighborhood and town",
    "were included in the question .",
    "for example , ` yesterday , at 23:56 you were in via degli orbi 4 , trento ` .",
    "the _ processed _ location variable referred to the total distance traveled in the previous day , resulting in questions such as ` yesterday you covered a total distance of 13 km ` .",
    "finally , location data was spatially clustered over the reference time - range using a threshold of 100 meters to generate the _ aggregated _ location question ( _ e.g. _ ` yesterday you have been in 23 different places ` ) .      with respect to running apps , the _ individual _ variable included the timestamp and the name of the app running in the foreground .",
    "_ processed _ app information referred to the total number of minutes that a particular app was running over a specific time in the previous day , whereas _ aggregated _ app variables referred to the total number of different apps that the participant ran the previous day .",
    "examples of questions on app - related information for each level of complexity are ` 2=0.4em 3=0.2em 4=0.1em 7=0.1em =  yesterday , at 10:23 you were using the firefox browser application ` , ` 2=0.4em 3=0.2em 4=0.1em 7=0.1em =  yesterday night , the google talk application run on your device for 82 minutes ` , and ` yesterday 9 applications were running on your device ` , respectively .",
    "_ individual _ media asked participants about the fact that they shot a photo at a specific time ( ` yesterday , at 14:23 , you shot one picture ` ) . for legal privacy reasons ,",
    "the questions referring to individual media data could not include the actual picture they referred to .",
    "_ processed _ media probed participants about their photo - taking activity during specific times of the day ( _ e.g. _ ` yesterday morning you took 4 pictures ` ) .",
    "finally , the _ aggregated _ media variable referred the total number of pictures shot the previous day ( _ e.g. _ ` yesterday you took 9 pictures ` ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , upon joining the lab each participant filled out 4 questionnaires to collect information about their personality , locus of control , dispositional trust and self - disclosure behaviors .",
    "the big five personality traits were measured by means of the bfms @xcite questionnaire , which is validated for the italian language and covers the traditional dimensions of extraversion , neuroticism , agreeableness , conscientiousness , and openness @xcite .",
    "participants also provided information about their _ locus of control _",
    "( loc ) @xcite , a psychological construct measuring whether causal attribution for subject behavior or beliefs is made to oneself or to external events and circumstances .",
    "the loc measures whether the outcomes of a set of beliefs are dependent upon what the subject does ( internal orientation ) or upon events outside of her / his control ( external orientation ) .",
    "loc was measured by the italian version of craig s locus of control scale @xcite .    moreover , we collected information about the participants _ dispositional trust_. rotter @xcite was among the first to discuss trust as a form of personality trait , defining interpersonal trust as a generalized expectancy that the words or promises of others can be relied on . in our study",
    ", we resort to mayer and davis s trust propensity scale @xcite .    finally , we targeted the _ self - disclosure _ attitudes of our subjects .",
    "self - disclosure has been defined as any message about the self that an individual communicates to another one @xcite .",
    "we used wheeless scale @xcite measuring five dimensions of emphself disclosure , namely ( i ) amount of disclosure , ( ii ) positive - negative nature of disclosure , ( iii ) consciously intended disclosure , ( iv ) honesty and accuracy of disclosure , and ( v ) general depth or intimacy of disclosure .",
    "wheeless scale has been utilized to measure self - disclosure in online communication and in interpersonal relationships @xcite .",
    "the personalized daily survey asked each participant to place a bid to sell one piece of their mobile personal information for each of the four categories of study ( communications , location , apps and media ) , for a specific level of complexity ( individual , processed , or aggregated ) and for the previous day .",
    "the winner of each auction won the monetary value associated with that auction . in exchange , (",
    "s)he sold that particular piece of information to the living lab which could use it for whatever purpose it wanted .    in order to ensure a balanced sample ,",
    "surveys were generated by rotating the different levels of complexity described above , such that each day participants placed bids in up to 4 auctions : one for each category of personal information and for a particular level of complexity ( individual , aggregated or processed ) .",
    "note that in the case a participant did not generate any data for a particular category , s(he ) was still asked to provide a valuation to the fact that there was no data in that category , _",
    "e.g. _ ` yesterday you did not make any phone call ` .    the participants bids entered a reverse second - price auction strategy , _",
    "i.e. _ , the winner was the participant(s ) who bid the lowest , and the prize was the second lowest bid .",
    "the choice of this auction mechanism was due to the following reasons : ( 1 ) the mechanism is truth telling given that the best strategy for the auction participants is to be honest about their valuation @xcite , ( 2 ) it is easy to explain and understand , and ( 3 ) it has successfully been used before to evaluate location information in @xcite and web - browsing information in @xcite .",
    "interventions , _",
    "i.e. _ individual communications of auction outcomes to participants , took the form of e - mails sent every thursday .    in order to evaluate possible effects of winning frequency on bidding behavior , we employed two different auction strategies for the first and second halves of the study . during the first 3 weeks ( phase 1 )",
    ", we carried out weekly auctions on wednesday , taking into account all bids that had been entered during the previous 7 days for each category .",
    "therefore , in this phase , 12 weekly auctions took place with the daily bids for each category and level of complexity ( 4 categories x 3 levels of complexity ) . during the last 3 weeks of the study ( phase 2 )",
    ", we switched to daily auctions ; furthermore , the sample of bidding participants was split into 3 random subsets in order to increase their chances of winning , resulting in a total of 12 auctions per day .",
    "email interventions were always on thursdays and therefore this change was transparent to participants .",
    "interventions were sent to all participants , whether they had won auctions or not . in the case of winners ,",
    "the intervention email included the specific piece of information that the participant had sold , the corresponding winning bid , and the amount won .",
    "in the case of losers , the intervention email simply communicated the participant that s(he ) did not win any of their auctions .",
    "all emails were kept neutral for both winners and losers .    in total",
    ", 596 auctions were run during the entire study ( 36 in the first three weeks , 560 afterwards ) .      as previously explained , at the beginning and at the end of the data collection participants were required to fill out initial and end - of - study ( eos ) questionnaires .",
    "the initial questionnaire consisted of 5 questions ( see table  [ tab : initsurvey ] ) and was used to gather information about the participants perception of privacy issues related to mobile personal data . from the responses provided to this survey , we notice that participants are concerned about mobile pii protection ( q1 ) but do not tend to read the terms of service ( q4 ) nor are aware of current legislation on data protection ( q5 ) .",
    "moreover , they do not seem to trust how neither application providers ( q2 ) nor telecom operators ( q3 ) use their data .",
    "the eos survey was designed to gather additional quantitative and qualitative information from our participants after the data collection was complete . in particular , we asked participants to put a value ( under the same auction game constraints ) on category - specific _ bulk information _ ",
    "_ i.e. _ all the data gathered in the study for each category .",
    "for instance , in the case of location information , a visualization of a participant s mobility data collected over the 6-weeks period was shown in the web questionnaire ( as depicted in figure  [ fig : bulk - screen ] ) and the participant was asked to assign it a monetary value .",
    "furthermore , for each category , we asked participants about the minimum / maximum valuations given during the study , in order to understand the reasons why they gave these valuations .",
    "table  [ tab : finalsurvey ] contains all the questions of the eos survey .",
    "the eos questionnaire was administered through a slightly modified version of the same web application used for the daily surveys .",
    "the main difference are the visualizations of the collected data .",
    "the data used throughout this paper was collected from october 28th and december 11th 2013 , inclusive .",
    "data was not collected for the first 3 days of november , due to the all saints festivities in italy ; hence , our data - set encompasses 43 days .",
    "a total of 2838 daily surveys were administered during this period .",
    "statistics on bidding data and participation follow .",
    "table [ tab : bid - values ] summarizes the bidding values for each personal data category and level of complexity .",
    "figure  [ fig : medianbids ] depicts median bid values each day for each category and level of complexity .",
    "the total amount won by participants in the form of auction awards was  262 which was paid in amazon vouchers .    additionally , we selected the ten subjects with the highest response rate and ran a raffle to select the winner of a final prize of  100 .",
    "a total of 29 subjects won at least one auction during the study ; the cardinality of the winning set ramped from 5 to 29 as an effect of the increased number of auctions run in the second phase of the study .",
    "the participation rates for daily surveys is 79% .",
    "as mentioned earlier , users were granted opt - out options for each survey question by ticking a check - box which portrayed ` i do not want to sell this information ` .    table  [ tab : rr - stats ] reports statistics of opt - out and distributions of valid responses ( _ i.e. _ survey items for which participants did not opt - out and entered their bid ) for each category .",
    "the bidding data that was collected in the study is not normally distributed .",
    "hence , we applied non - parametric analysis to test whether significant differences exist in the value distributions of different types of personal data .",
    "thus , we report results using the kruskal - wallis test with a level of significance of @xmath5 .    furthermore , we carried out correlation analyses to investigate whether associations between mobile phone usage patterns , demographics , subjects predispositions , traits and auction behavior exist .",
    "for these analyses we employed the non - parametric spearman s rho method with a level of significance of @xmath5 .      we investigate first daily bids and specifically whether significant differences exist between ( 1 ) the categories and ( 2 ) levels of complexity within each category of mobile personal data we collected .",
    "significant differences in bid distributions were found between all data categories , with the only exception of communications and apps .    the lack of statistically significant differences between communications and apps could be partially explained by the fact that most of the apps installed and used by participants in the study are communication apps . in terms of both running time and installations , @xmath650% of",
    "the top 20 apps are messaging apps ( whatsapp and similar ) , email ( gmail , hotmail , y!mail ) , voice - over - ip clients ( skype , viber ) and social networking clients ( facebook ) .",
    "we thus hypothesize that the distinction between communication and apps might be blurred .",
    "we leave the validation of such a hypothesis to future work .",
    "nonetheless , the finding that participants seem to perceive , and consequently valuate , communications provided by a telco company and those provided by mobile apps in a similar manner , is intriguing and worth investigating .",
    "next we analyzed the differences in the distribution of bids within the different levels of complexity of mobile personal data .",
    "in other words , we looked if bid distributions within a given mobile data category showed significant differences for individual , aggregated , and processed information .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    no significant differences were found in within - category analyses for communications and locations . in other words , participants valued similarly the communication and location data with each of the 3 levels of complexity .      as described earlier , in the middle of the study we increased the frequency of auctions from weekly ( phase 1 ) to daily ( phase 2 ) .",
    "this change was transparent to participants and the frequency of email interventions was kept constant  every thursday .",
    "we designed these two phases to assess if the probability of winning had an effect on bidding behavior .",
    "indeed , we observe significant differences in bid distributions between the two phases for all categories : locations ( @xmath14 ) , communications ( @xmath15 ) , apps ( @xmath16 ) and media ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "moreover , we find that mobile pii valuations drop for all categories in the second phase , as more participants won the auctions to monetize their data .",
    "the monetary valuations gathered in the final questionnaire for bulk information ( _ i.e. _ all the data collected in the 6-weeks presented in aggregated / anonymized form ) are summarized in table  [ tab : bulk - bids - stats ] . since participants could opt - out , we also report opt - out percentages for bulk information .    comparing with daily bids ( see table [ tab : bid - values ] ) , the median bids for bulk information are one order of magnitude larger than the median individual bids , except for the media category .",
    "mean opt - out percentages are similar except for the apps category . the value ranking obtained from daily bids ( location @xmath18 communications @xmath18 apps @xmath18 media ) is different from that obtained in bulk bids ( location @xmath18 apps @xmath18 communications @xmath18 media ) . in particular ,",
    "application - related bulk data is valued significantly higher than communications - related bulk information .      in order to assess whether significant effects exist between mobile phone usage patterns and bidding behavior , we first computed daily behavioral variables from the sensed data .",
    "table  [ tab : usage - feats ] depicts the variables that we extracted with a daily granularity and for each participant .    with respect to _ location _ data , information about the number of places visited was derived under the assumption that two locations would correspond to different places if the distance between them was larger than a threshold set to 100 meters .",
    "the radius of gyration corresponds to the radius of the smallest circle encompassing all location points registered each day .",
    "for all these behavioral variables , we computed higher - order features corresponding to their statistical behavior over the 6-weeks period : mean , median , standard deviation , coefficient of variation ( ratio of the standard deviation to the mean ) and the quartile coefficient of dispersion .",
    "the last two features capture dispersion effects .    furthermore , for each participant and data category , we computed mean , median , and standard deviation of their bids .",
    "we studied all correlations found between daily behavioral variables and bids in each category .",
    "we found a positive correlation between the mean location bid value and the median of daily distance traveled ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "that is , the larger the daily distance traveled , the higher the valuations of location information . with respect to applications , there are several statistically significant correlations . in particular ,",
    "the total app running time is negatively correlated with the median app bid value ( @xmath20 ) , meaning that the more time a participant spent using mobile apps , the lower the median valuations of app information .",
    "no significant correlation was found between communication and photo - taking behavioral features and bids on the communications and media categories .      there were a number of significant correlations between bids on bulk information and daily behaviors .",

    "the overall median bid value in our study was @xmath9  2 while carrascal _",
    "_ reported an overall median bid value equal to @xmath9  7 when they took in account context - dependent personal information .",
    "there are a few methodological differences between both studies which might explain the differences in bid values .",
    "in particular , @xcite asked participants to provide a valuation of personal information captured while browsing the web _ in - situ _ using a rsem methodology . instead",
    ", we employed a drm methodology querying participants about ther mobile pii from the previous day . from the valuations obtained in @xcite and our study , it seems that individual pieces of pii are not as valuable when queried _ out - of - context _ such as in our study than _ in context _ such as in @xcite .",
    "conversely , bulk mobile pii was valued higher in our study than in @xcite and significantly higher than individual pii .",
    "as shown in tables [ tab : bid - values ] and [ tab : bulk - bids - stats ] , bulk information was valued an order of magnitude higher than individual data except for information in the media category .",
    "this finding is probably due to the power of the visualizations in the eos survey , particularly for location and apps data .",
    "one hypothesis for this higher valuation is that participants realized how bulk data conveyed information about their life - style and habits and therefore considered it to be more valuable than daily items .",
    "recently , tang _",
    "et al . _ have shown the impact of different visualization types ( text- , map- , and time - based ) on social sharing of location data @xcite .",
    "this result has a direct consequence for the design of trading mobile pii and highlights an asymmetry between buyers and sellers : for buyers , it would be more profitable to implement mechanisms to trade single pieces of information that they could later aggregate . for sellers , however , it would be more advantageous to sell bulks of information .      as shown in tables [",
    "tab : bid - values ] and [ tab : bulk - bids - stats ] , location information received the highest valuation for all levels of complexity and was the most opted - out category of mobile pii .",
    "bulk location information was very highly valued , probably due to the powerful effect of the map visualization in the eos survey .",
    "several participants also expressed that they did not want to be geolocalized and considered location information to be highly sensitive and personal .",
    "moreover , we found statistically significant correlations between mobility behaviors ( _ e.g. _ mean daily distance traveled , daily radius of gyration , etc . ) and valuations of personal data .",
    "not all users value their personal data equally : the more someone travels on a daily basis , the more s / he values not only her / his location information but also her / his communication and application information .    regarding this relation , previous works who focused on location information have presented contrasting results  @xcite ; as we probe participants daily about fine - grained personal data they have just produced , our approach substantially differs from these survey - based studies , and it is thus difficult to directly compare with these works . generally , our results seem to support the findings presented in  @xcite .",
    "these insights may have an impact on the design of commercial location - sharing applications . while users of such applications might consent at install time to share their location with the app",
    ", our work suggests that when explicitly asked about either individual or bulk location data , @xmath48 of users decide not to share their location information .",
    "in addition , mobility behaviors will influence the valuations of pii .",
    "tsai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite conducted an online survey with more than 500 american subjects to evaluate their own perceptions of the likelihood of several location - sharing scenarios along with the magnitude of the benefit or harm of each scenario ( _ e.g. _ being stalked or finding people in an emergency ) .",
    "the majority of the participants found the risks of using location - sharing technologies to be higher than the benefits .",
    "however , today a significant number of very popular mobile apps such as foursquare and facebook places make use of location data . these popular commercial location sharing apps seem to mitigate users privacy concerns by allowing them to selectively report their location using check - in funtionalities instead of tracking them automatically .    based on our findings and given our participants concerns and high valuations of bulk location information , we believe that further user - centric studies on sharing and monetary valuation of location data are needed .",
    "when we correlated bid values against socio - demographic characteristics , we did not find significant correlations .",
    "this result is in contrast to previous work that found socio - demographic ( mainly sex and age ) differences in privacy concerns and consequent information disclosure behaviors @xcite .",
    "however , these previous studies were focused mainly on online information and on disclosure attitudes and privacy concerns than on monetary valuation of personal data .",
    "@xcite , instead , found results in line with ours ( no significant correlations ) except for a surprising low valuation of online information from older users .    on the other hand",
    ", we found statistically significant correlations between behavior ( particularly mobility and app usage ) and valuations of bids . from our findings",
    "it seems that personal differences in valuations of mobile pii are associated with behavioral differences rather than demographic differences . in particular , the larger the daily distance traveled and radius of gyration , the higher the valuation of pii .",
    "conversely , the more apps a person used , the lower the valuation of pii . a potential reason for this correlation is due to the fact that savvy app users have accepted that mobile apps collect their mobile pii in order to provide their service and hence value their mobile pii less .",
    "we found a positive correlation between the intentional / unintentional dimension of self - disclosure and the median values of the bids .",
    "this result could be explained by the fact that people with more intentional control about disclosing their own personal information , may be more aware of their personal data and hence also value it more from a monetary point of view .",
    "interestingly , we did not find significant correlations between bid values and other traits with the exception of agreeablenness ( with bulk location and communication bids ) .",
    "previous studies on the influence played by individual traits ( usually personality traits and loc ) on privacy dispositions and privacy - related behaviors have provided contrasting evidence : some of them found small correlations @xcite , while schrammel _",
    "et al . _ found no correlations @xcite .",
    "hence , our results require additional investigations in order to clarify which are , if any , the dispositions and individual characteristics to take in account when a buyer makes a monetary offer for personal data .      from our study and from carrascal",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it clearly emerges that individuals mainly trust themselves to handle their own personal data .",
    "this result suggests the adoption of a decentralized and _ user - centric _",
    "architecture for personal data management .",
    "recently , several research groups have started to design and build personal data repositories which enable people to control , collect , delete , share , and sell personal data @xcite , and whose value to users is supported by our findings .      during our study",
    "there were two unusual days : december 8th ( immaculate conception holiday ) and november 11th ( a day with extremely strong winds which caused multiple road blocks and accidents ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : medianbids ] , the median bids for all categories in these two days were significantly higher than for the rest of the days in the study .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , participants in our study value their pii higher in days that are unusual when compared to typical days .",
    "this result suggests that not all pii even within the same category and level of complexity is valued equally by our participants , which has a direct implication for personal data markets and for services that monetize mobile personal data .",
    "we have investigated the monetary value that people assign to their pii as it is collected by their mobile phone .",
    "in particular , we have taken into account four categories of pii ( location , communication , apps and media ) with three levels of complexity ( individual , aggregated and processed ) .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive 6-week long study in a living lab environment with 60 participants adopting a day reconstruction method along with a reverse second price auction mechanism to collect honest monetary valuations .",
    "we have found that location is the most valued category of pii and that bulk information is valued much higher than individual information ( except for the media category ) .",
    "we have identified individual differences in bidding behaviors which are not correlated with socio - demographic traits , but are correlated with behavior ( mobility and app usage ) and intentional self - disclosure .",
