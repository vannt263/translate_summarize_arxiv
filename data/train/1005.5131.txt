    "it was the measurement of velocity dispersions in the coma cluster by fritz zwicky in 1933 @xcite which led the requirement of nonluminous matter in our universe for the first time . since then , a wide variety of evidence on nonbaryonic dark matter ( dm ) has been accumulated , such as the galactic rotation curve @xcite and the bullet cluster @xcite .",
    "the current relic abundance of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe has been observed by the wmap for seven years",
    "@xcite such that @xmath0 where the scaled hubble constant @xmath1 in the units of @xmath2 km / sec / mpc , combined with distance measurements from type ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "this result indicates that about 23.3 % of our universe , or 84.4 % of matter is non - baryonic cdm , which motivates the theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "various candidates of cdm explaining the observed relic abundance has been proposed . among them ,",
    "the most promising one is weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) such as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the supersymmetric models with r - parity @xcite , the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) particle in the extra dimensional models with kk parity @xcite , the lightest t - odd particle in the t - parity conserved little higgs model @xcite , and the sm gauge singlet particles in higgs portal models @xcite .",
    "wimps are produced at the early stage of our universe and their current relic abundance is naturally determined when their interactions to the sm particles freeze out @xcite .",
    "in the meantime , direct detection experiments to detect wimp scattering off target nuclei have been constructed to figure out the physical properties of them .",
    "recently , the coherent germanium neutrino technology ( cogent ) experiment reported that about a hundred events @xcite exceeding the expected background are observed after their eight week operation , which possibly originated from the nuclear recoil by dm scattering . due to its enhanced sensitivity to low energy events ,",
    "the ionization signal which is observed in the cogent detector is as low as @xmath3 kevee .",
    "comparing with the energy threshold of dama / libra @xcite which is @xmath4 kevee combined with the channeling effect , this energy threshold is tremendous .",
    "the discovery region , hence , supports the existence of light dm whose mass is @xmath5 gev and the spin independent wimp - nucleon elastic scattering cross section @xmath6 is as high as @xmath7 @xmath8 .    the light wimp with large cross section is also favored in the recent dama / libra annual modulation signal . considering the channeling effect @xcite",
    ", the result allows sizable parameter space compatible with other null experiments .",
    "there have been several proposals to explain this , such as light sm gauge singlet fermion @xcite or scalar dm @xcite , the wimpless model @xcite , light neutralinos in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) without the assumption of gaugino mass unification at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xcite , right - handed sneutrino dm in an extended model of mssm @xcite , and the mirror dm model @xcite , etc .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to propose a plausible light wimp scenario .    in this paper , we analyze a light neutralino dm scenario since supersymmetry ( susy ) is the most promising candidate among the theories beyond the sm . in order to have such a large scattering cross section in a supersymmetric sm ,",
    "either large value of @xmath9 or a very light cp - even higgs boson mediator is needed in the process of elastic scattering of the neutralino off the target nuclei .",
    "such scenarios can not be easily realized in the context of the mssm since they are highly constrained by other experiments such as the lep , tevatron , and rare decays .",
    "especially , it is not easy to obtain @xmath6 as high as @xmath10 for the explanation of the cogent result with conventional halo parameters , even though we consider the previous approach to explain the dama / libra result such as the reference @xcite and the rare decay @xmath11 are needed to be considered in @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , the  beyond the mssm \" ( bmssm ) considerations are required in this paper . without considering additional light degrees of freedom ,",
    "the light higgs scenario is natural to be studied first , which we focus on here .",
    "( scenarios with light degrees of freedom are explained in @xcite with the nmssm context and in @xcite with the sm gauge singlet dirac fermion .",
    "the latter can be also obtained by slightly changing the nmssm potential with singlet quadratic terms . )",
    "we start from analyzing the parameter space to obtain the large detection cross section @xmath12 for the light wimp of @xmath13 gev @xmath14 @xmath15 gev in order to avoid the bounds from the null experiments . due to the limits by the lep experiments and @xmath16 decay ,",
    "the parameter space of light higgs is constrained to be in the window of 9 to 10 gev .",
    "it is , then , interesting that the resonance channel in the wimp annihilation process is naturally considered on the viable parameter domain , which provides the right relic abundance of the light neutralino .",
    "therefore , the light neutralino with mass of 5 to 6 gev can explain the correct relic abundance .",
    "it must be noticed that this research does not concern the details of the theoretical construction but will focus on the compatible parameter space in the supersymmetric model to explain the viable light wimp consistent with the various experiments .",
    "there have been researches to reconcile the cogent report on wimp signals with other null experiments constraining the detection bound and the previous dama result @xcite . at first sight",
    ", it seems that the cogent signal events are excluded by other experiments mainly due to the cdms - si @xcite and the recent xenon100 @xcite .",
    "it is important , however , that the cogent collaboration has not analyzed all the background events such as surface events through the intra contact surface and those by electro - formed cryostat components , etc .",
    "it is , hence , possible for the sizable cogent signals to avoid the exclusion limits by considering proper background models , combined with changing the wimp distribution or detector parameters such as halo profile and scintillation efficiency @xmath17 used in those experiments .",

    "considering the resonant annihilation of wimps through the @xmath215-channel process , the thermal average of @xmath216 is affected by the values of @xmath217 not close to the average value .",
    "therefore , the following full calculation is needed as described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath218 where @xmath219 @xmath220 gev is the planck mass , and @xmath221 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the freeze - out temperature @xmath222 gev .",
    "the inverse freeze - out temperature @xmath223 is determined by the iterative equation @xmath224 where the assumption that @xmath225 obtains @xmath226 where we use the series expansion at @xmath227 in the second line .",
    "hence , we approximately obtain @xmath228     to @xmath20 with fixed @xmath229 and @xmath230 values . the allowed mass of the light cp - even higgs is @xmath190 gev @xmath119 @xmath18 gev .",
    "the magenta , blue , green lines denote the case @xmath231 gev , 9.5 gev , 10 gev respectively .",
    "the parameters are given to avoid the lep or @xmath16 decay constraints .",
    "the red region denotes the observed relic abundance satisfying ( [ eq : dmrelic ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the physically consistent mass of our light wimp is determined as @xmath232 gev@xmath233 @xmath234 gev here.,width=529 ]    the annihilation cross section of the neutralinos to @xmath116-quark pairs dominantly determines the present relic abundance within 10 % accuracy .",
    "the rest of the contributions are from the annihilations to the lighter fermions such as @xmath122-lepton and @xmath235-quark pairs .",
    "therefore , we obtain the cross section such that @xmath236 where the center of mass energy @xmath237 and @xmath238 is the total decay width of the cp - even higgs @xmath55 such that @xmath239 where the contributions from lighter fermion final states are ignored .",
    "we show the role of resonant annihilation to obtain the observed relic density of ( [ eq : dmrelic ] ) in fig.[fig : relic ] .",
    "the parameter space is chosen to satisfy the lep and @xmath16 decay constraints . in this figure , we fix @xmath181 , @xmath230 values",
    ". the allowed mass of the light cp - even higgs is @xmath190 gev @xmath119 @xmath18 gev .",
    "the magenta , blue , green lines denote the case @xmath231 gev , 9.5 gev , 10 gev , respectively .",
    "the parameters are given to avoid the lep or @xmath16 decay constraints .",
    "the red region denotes the observed relic abundance satisfying ( [ eq : dmrelic ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the expected relic abundance decreases around the resonance region so that the mass of the light neutralino is determined within @xmath232 gev@xmath233 @xmath234 gev .",
    "the physically consistent range of @xmath20 is similar for other possible parameter choice since the right relic abundance will be obtained within the the resonant annihilation process .",
    "the qcd phase transition occurs around @xmath240 gev@xmath241 in our favorite parameter region , which might be a dangerous threat to our calculation of ( [ eq : sigv ] ) since we have to consider the hadronization of quarks .",
    "fortunately , the recent result in lattice qcd method @xcite informs us that the critical temperature of qcd phase transition is as low as @xmath242 gev when we consider the number of flavor is three .",
    "now , it is fair to explain the situations after the first version of this paper was submitted to the e - print arxiv .",
    "it is claimed that the scintillation efficiency @xmath17 in the xenon detectors are not so much suppressed above 3.4 kev nuclear recoil energy so that even xenon10 can provide the strong exclusion bound to the wimp heavier than 6 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is another interesting approach avoiding the discussions on the @xmath17 by focussing on the s2 only signal in xenon10 @xcite .",
    "there are two pmts in xenon experiments , called s1 and s2 .",
    "the s1 measures the scintillation inside the detector , while the s2 measures the ionization signal by which the discrimination of the background signals is well performed .",
    "since the @xmath17 is only related to the scintillation , the s2 only analysis is a very fancy idea to probe the  exclusion \" bound of the light wimps in contrast to the discovery region .",
    "none of the proposals , however , rules out the wimp scattering signals whose mass is @xmath243 gev and the elastic scattering cross section of @xmath75 , which can be expected by considering proper background contaminations in the cogent results . in this sense , our neutralino of mass 5 to 6 gev is quite promising in the search for viable light wimps .",
    "the light wimps with large cross section are focused on due to the recent results of direct detection experiments such as cogent and dama .",
    "since susy is one of the most promising candidates of the theory beyond the sm , light neutralino should be carefully studied . in this sense , we have shown that such a light neutralino can be obtained from the light cp - even higgs scenario . in the context of the mssm ,",
    "however , the existence of such a light higgs is highly constrained by the lep experiments .",
    "instead , we looked for a possibility of explaining @xmath244 , @xmath245 4 to 7 gev dark matter within the framework of the bmssm ( mssm field contents at and below the weak scale ) and found that @xmath246 9 to 10 gev can provide the required @xmath6 . if we require the model to explain the right relic abundance , @xmath20 is predicted to be in between 5 to 6 gev depending on the light cp even higgs mass from 9 to 10 gev .",
    "combined with the improvement of the detector parameters such as @xmath17 at low energy , more data in the current or future direct detection experiments will eventually reveal whether the light dark matter scenario inspired by cogent and dama / libra is realized in nature or not .",
    "we pointed out that it is possible to come up with a model in supersymmetric theories without introducing an additional light degree of freedom in addition to the mssm at and below the weak scale .",
