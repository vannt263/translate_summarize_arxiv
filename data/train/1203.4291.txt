    "the crab nebula is the remnant of supernova explosion recorded by chinese astronomers in ad 1054 .",
    "it is the archetype of center - filled supernova remnants ( or plerions ) with a distant of @xmath22 kpc and one of most well - studied objects in almost all wavebands from low frequency radio to very high energy @xmath4-ray .",
    "the overall non - thermal radiation of crab nebula is mainly dominated by synchrotron process and inverse compton scattering .",
    "the synchrotron origin of the optical and radio continuum emission was proposed by shklovskii ( 1953 ) and experimentally confirmed by polarization observations ( dombrovsky 1954 ) .",
    "the nebula is powered by the central crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 ) .",
    "it is the second brightest pulsar in the northern sky at radio waveband and visible through the whole observable electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "in addition , the pulsar is one of the best studied and most energetic pulsar .",
    "the spin down power for the pulsar is @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "approximately 10% - 20% of the spin - down energy of the pulsar is converted into the radiation of the nebula .",
    "its pulse frequency ( @xmath8 = 30 hz ) and pulse frequency derivative ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) yields an characteristic age of 1240 years , very close to the actual age .",
    "the average emission profiles of crab pulsar are dominated by a main pulse ( mp ) and an interpulse ( ip ) .",
    "the mp and ip are separated @xmath2 0.4 in pulse phase in all wavelength bands .",
    "but the pulse peaks are not fully aligned in phase over the entire energy range .",
    "previous timing of the pulsar over many orders of magnitude of energy found that there is a delay of the radio main pulse compared to the first peak seen from optical to hard @xmath4-rays .",
    "recent measurements of the optical , x , @xmath4-ray to radio lag are : 255 @xmath11s ( oosterbroek et al . 2008 ) , 275 @xmath11s ( s. molkov et al . 2009 ) , 281 @xmath11s ( abdo et al . 2010 ) , respectively .",
    "the small differences in pulse phase alignment allow us to study the emission regions at very small scales .",
    "romani & yadigaroglu ( 1995 ) have proposed that the radio precursor comes at the polar cap , whereas the main pulse and interpulse originate in the outer gap of the magnetosphere , and higher energy pulses are generated at significantly greater heights .",
    "therefore , precise timing of mean pulse profiles over the full range of electromagnetic spectrum is a powerful tool for understanding of the nature and spatial origin of the emission mechanisms .",
    "the crab pulsar , just like many young pulsars , is influenced by significant glitches and timing noise in pulse frequency . timing noise in the crab pulsar",
    "is the dominant component in the timing residuals after removal of the spin - down model and glitch effects from the pulse phase and seen as continuous , noise - like fluctuation in frequency .",
    "scott et al . ( 2003 ) shows the timing noise is composed of two components : a long - term quasi - periodic oscillation with a period of 568 @xmath12 10 days and a red noise process with an approximately _ _",
    "f__@xmath13 power density spectrum .",
    "pulsar glitches are characterized by the sudden increases in pulse frequency .",
    "glitches are rather rare and unpredictable phenomena , and they vary significantly for different pulsars . the characteristics of glitches and the post - glitch recovery behavior provide an important diagnostic tool to study neutron star interiors ( e.g. , ruderman 1969 ; baym et al .",
    "1969 ) . for the crab pulsar ,",
    "twenty four glitches have been detected from 1969 to 2008 ( lyne et al . 1993 ; wong et al .",
    "2001 ; wang et al . 2001a",
    "; espinoza et al .",
    "the glitches of crab pulsar are characterized by their small relative size , rapid exponential relaxation towards extrapolated pre - glitch frequency and a persistent change in frequency derivative at each glitch . moreover , the large glitches in 1989 and 1996 manifests gradual spin - up right after the initial frequency jump and each glitch may accompanied by an `` aftershock '' or secondary spin - ups 20 - 40 days after an event .",
    "the persistent increase in the magnitude of pulse frequency derivative may be due either to an increase in the external torque ( link et al .",
    "1992 ) or a variation in the momentum of inertia acted on by the torque ( alpar et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in order to study the glitch process ,",
    "long - term monitoring of frequent glitching pulsars such as crab and vela are necessary . here",
    "we present timing observations of the crab pulsar from 2000 to 2010 .",
    "nine glitches have been observed at xinjiang astronomical observatory during this period .",
    "timing observations of crab pulsar at 1540 mhz commenced in 2000 january as part of pulsar monitoring program at xinjiang astronomical observatory ( wang et al .",
    "2001b ) , with about one observing session per week . a dual - channel room temperature receiver ( @xmath2 100",
    "k ) was used and then updated to a cryogenic system in 2002 july , which allow us to detect pulsars with a mean flux density greater than 0.5 mjy .",
    "the two hands of circular polarization are sent to a filter - bank consisting of 2@xmath14128 channels of width 2.5 mhz .",
    "the data are 1-bit digitized and sampled at 1-ms intervals .",
    "time is provided by a hydrogen maser calibrated by the global position system ( gps ) and a latched microsecond counter .",
    "the integration time of each observation for the crab pulsar is 16 minutes .",
    "the offline data was dedispersed to remove the dispersion effects of interstellar medium and folded at nominal topocentric period to produce a mean pulse profile .",
    "topocentric times of arrival ( toas ) were obtained by cross - correlating the mean pulse profile with a noise - free template using psrchive soft package ( hotan et al .",
    "local arrival times were converted to solar - system barycenter times by using tempo2(hobbs et al .",
    "2006 ) with jet propulsion laboratory ephemeris de405 ( standish 1998 ) .",
    "toas are weighted by the inverse square of their uncertainty .",
    "uncertainties in the fitted parameters are taken to be twice the formal uncertainties obtained from tempo2 .",
    "the pulse phase @xmath15 predicted by standard timing model is expressed as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pulse phase at reference time @xmath18 .",
    "glitches are usually described as combinations of step changes of @xmath8 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , parts of which decay exponentially : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pulse frequency and pulse frequency derivative extrapolated from pre - glitch model , respectively ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the permanent changes in frequency , its first and second derivatives relative to the extrapolated pre - glitch values , respectively , and @xmath28 is the amplitude of an exponential relaxation component with a decay time constant of @xmath29 .",
    "the total frequency and frequency derivative changes at the time of the glitch are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . and the degree of recovery can be described by parameter : @xmath32 .",
    "the pulsar position used in the reduction is taken from the jodrell bank crab pulsar timing results monthly ephemeris(lyne et al .",
    "nine glitches have been observed in the crab pulsar during the period from 1999 october to 2010 september ( mjd 51455 to mjd 55446 ) . however , according to espinoza et al.(2011a ) , there were eleven glitches during the period .",
    "we missed two small glitches ( 5 and 9 ) because of the observation gaps .",
    "table 1 lists the pre- and post - glitch rotation parameters .",
    "estimated uncertainties in the last quoted digit are given in brackets .",
    "as shown in table 1 , several interglitch intervals are very short .",
    "it is quite difficult to get the value of @xmath20 for such a short data span .",
    "in addition , these @xmath20 values could be affected by the effect of post - glitch exponential decay .",
    "therefore , we keep the @xmath20 at a fixed value which can make the braking index equal to 2.51 for these very short interglitch intervals .",

    "the frequency jump of glitch 1 can be easily recognized from the middle panel of glt1 in fig.2 .",
    "the post - glitch increment of pulse frequency derivative can be seen in the bottom panel as well , and this glitch caused a permanent change of pulse frequency derivative .",

    "melatos et al .",
    "( 2008 ) shows the glitch occurence is quasi - periodic .",
    "the typical and relatively quasi - periodic glitch occurence present in each pulsar might indicate that a critical lag between the rotation of the superfluid and crust has to be achieved in order for a glitch to occur ( alpar et al .",
    "1993 ) . figure 4 shows the relation between the fractional glitch size and the time since previous glitch for the crab and the vela pulsars .",
    "the size of glitches for the crab pulsar are obtained from espinoza et al .",
    "( 2011a ) and this work .",
    "the crab pulsar has a wide range in both parameters while most glitches of vela pulsar are large and have longer interglitch intervals .",
    "for both pulsars , little correlation are found between glitch sizes and the time since last glitch , even though theoretical predictions prefer that the amplitude of a glitch would be proportional to the intervals of preceding glitch ( e.g. , alpar et al .",
    "1989 ; ruderman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "some pulsars like the crab only experienced small glitches ( e.g. , yuan et al .",
    "2010 ; krawczyk et al .",
    "2003 ) , while vela - like pulsar are characterized by large size glitches ( e.g. , shemar & lyne 1996 ; wang et al . 2000 ) . some pulsars exhibit wide glitch size distribution spanning three or even four orders of magnitude ( 10@xmath59 to 10@xmath60 hz ; e.g. , lyne 1987 ; janssen & stappers 2006 ) .",
    "the absence of large glitch in the crab pulsar is likely attributed to its relative young age ; the stresses build up during steady spin down can partly relieved by gradual process such as vortex creep and plastic flow at high crustal temperature ( e.g. , ruderman 1991 ; mckenna & lyne 1990 ) . as shown in figure 4 , there is no significant correlation between the glitch size and the time since last glitch for the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "in addition , lack of correlation between glitch size and preceding interglitch interval in most pulsars ( e.g. , yuan et al .",
    "2010 ; wang et al . 2010 ) suggests that the triggering of glitches is not closely related to global slowdown of the pulsar .",
    "the activity parameter @xmath61 is defined to be a long - term indicator of glitch effects ( wong et al .",
    "figure 5 shows a cumulative plot of persistent changes in @xmath8 as a function of time for the crab pulsar since 1969 .",
    "the activity parameter @xmath62 , which is represented by the slope of this relation , is about 1.4 @xmath63 .",
    "this value is essentially the same as that of given by wong et al .",
    "it implies that the rate of angular momentum loss caused by glitch has not changed significantly , in spite of high glitch rate during the past 10 yr .     caused by glitches plotted as a function of time based on data from table 2 .",
    "the dashed line represent a least - squares fit to the midpoints of the frequency jumps .",
    "the slope of the dashed line is an estimate of the activity parameter a@xmath64.,height=226 ]    the persistent changes in @xmath19 caused by the crab pulsar glitches is probably due to the formation of new vortex capacitors ( alpar et al .",
    "superfluid decouples from the steady slow down of star crust leading to the decrease of moment of inertia .",
    "therefore , the external torque acts on a lower moment of inertia and thus @xmath65 increases . on the other hand , the variation of external torque result in change in @xmath19 , maybe due to an increase in the dipole magnetic field ( ruderman et al .",
    "1998 ) or a change angle between magnetic and rotation axis ( link et al .",
    "a long term asymptotic exponential rise in frequency , as shown in figure 7b of lyne et al .",
    "( 1993 ) was observed after the 1975 , 1981 , 1986 and 1989 glitches .",
    "however , no similar event has been observed since .",
    "this is probably because the timescale of asymptotic rise exceeds the interglitch intervals .",
    "the wide range of glitch parameters implies a local phenomenon of the crab pulsar in which starquakes could be responsible for crab glitches .",
    "the small size of glitches , permanent postglitch offsets in the frequency derivative and the large recovery fraction of crab pulsar glitches shown by our and previous results are all consistent with starquakes model ( e.g. , lyne 1992 ; alpar et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ; link et al . 1998 ; franco et al . 2000 ; crawford and demianski 2003 ) .",
    "by contrast , starquakes can not be the cause of glitches for the vela pulsar ( lyne 1992 ; alpar et al .",
    "1993 ; chau et al . 1993 ; alpar et al . 1995 ; crawford and demianski 2003 ) .",
    "the high glitch rate makes it difficult to measure the braking index of the crab pulsar .",
    "the interval between glitch 9 and glitch 10 is relatively longer . and",
    "the crab pulsar has not experienced any glitch after 2008 april ( glitch 11 ) .",
    "we measure the braking indices for these two data spans .",
    "observed values of frequency and its first and second derivates can be used to obtain the braking index _",
    "n _ , using the equation : @xmath66 in order to avoid the effect of exponential decay of the steps in @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the glitch , we omitted the observations about one year after the previous glitch .",
    "the braking indices are calculated based on the timing parameters listed in table 1 for these two data spans , giving values of 2.454(7 ) and 2.571(3 ) , respectively . the previous measured value of braking index show a remarkable constant value 2.51 ( lyne et al .",
    "1993 , wong et al .",
    "it is clear that there is an evident change in braking index .",
    "the @xmath67 changes have been found by wong et al .",
    "in fact , the changes in braking index which have become more marked during the last 20 years or so , when the amount of glitch activity increased . the value of braking index after glitch 11 is larger than the previous measured value , whereas the other braking index measured between glitch 9 to glitch 10 is much smaller .",
    "so the scatter of braking index is much larger than that given by lyne et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and wong et al .",
    "the reason of a varying braking index may be due to a varying particle wind .",
    "a particle wind in addition to the magnetic dipole radiation may account for a braking index less than three ( michel 1969 ; manchester et al .",
    "1985 ; xu & qiao 2001 ; espinoza et al .",
    "the existence of particle wind is verified by observations of intermittent pulsars ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ; camilo et al .",
    "a fluctuating wind may contribute to the long term timing noise ( lyne et al .",
    "2010 ; liu et al .",
    "another consequence of a varying particle wind will be a varying braking index",
    ". this may be the case of psr j1846 - 0258 ( livingstone et al . 2011 ) . in this paper , we apply the pulsar wind model of xu & qiao ( 2001 ) to the crab pulsar .",
    "( other pulsar wind models are similar .",
    "they contain a dipole component and wind component , e.g. spitkovsky 2006 . ) employing the polar cap model of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) and considering that the wind strength may depart from the long term average value , figure 6 shows the braking index as a function of wind strength ( xu & qiao 2001 ) .",
    "a larger wind strength will cause the braking index smaller .",
    "a wind strength of 1.19 will give a braking index 2.45 , and a wind strength of 0.87 corresponds to a braking index of 2.57 .",
    "therefore , a varying wind strength will result in a varying braking index naturally .",
    "the variations from long term average value are mainly fluctuations .",
    "this fluctuations may be caused by frequent glitches of the crab pulsar , similar to the glitch induced magnetospheric activities seen in magnetars ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "since we only have two braking index measurements at present , an estimation of possible short term net increase in wind strength is very uncertain .",
    "based on these two measurements , the net increase in wind strength is three percent .",
    "the corresponding relative change in slow - down rate is 0.007 .",
    "accurate to one order of magnitude , this is consistent with the largest increase in slow - down rate after glitches as shown in table 3 .",
    "we have presented timing observations of the crab pulsar from 2000 to 2010 . during this period ,",
    "this pulsar manifest a higher rate of glitch activities than previous , with nine glitches detected over a period of 8 yr . the number of glitches in the crab pulsar has increased considerably .",
    "the distribution of interglitch intervals is still in agreement with a random process .",
    "there is no correlation between the glitch amplitude and the time since the last glitch . in accord with previous study ( lyne et al .",
    "1993 , wong et al .",
    "2001 ) , permanent changes in pulse frequency derivative are observed at the time of each glitch . since the relative small permanent frequency changes for the recent glitches , the average pulse frequency derivative caused by glitches ( represent by the activity parameter @xmath62 ) almost remains the same , in spite of the high glitching rate .",
    "the braking index shows an relative obvious variation , which may be due to a varying particle wind strength induced by glitches .",
