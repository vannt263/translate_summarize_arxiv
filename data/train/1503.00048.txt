    "one of the most striking differences between crystalline and amorphous solids is the difficulty of defining analogs of lattice defects such as vacancies , interstitials and dislocations in the latter  @xcite .",
    "the lack of a unique reference configuration in an amorphous solid precludes the use of such geometrical devices such as ideal lattice sites or burgers circuits .",
    "recent studies of the mechanical deformation of glasses do offer a clue , however  @xcite .",
    "it is now accepted that one may identify regions in the amorphous solid which undergo _ non - affine _",
    "distortions  @xcite , i.e.  displacements that can not be represented as a uniform strain or rotation acting on a reference volume , @xmath0 , in the presence of external stresses .",
    "the dynamics of such regions has been used to describe irreversible plastic deformation of amorphous solids , in ways roughly analogous to that of dislocations in crystals  @xcite .",
    "continuing along this line of thinking , one may ask whether configurations involving topological defects in crystalline solids may be singled out using only measures of the local non - affine displacements  @xcite of atoms away from their ideal reference positions , _ without _ explicit reference to a burgers circuit ? in ref .",
    "@xcite an affirmative answer to this question was given for the case of dislocation dipoles in the ideal two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice .",
    "it was shown @xmath1 that specific localised vibrational modes contribute to non - affine displacements in crystals , @xmath2 the largest contribution to thermally excited non - affine fluctuations arises from particle displacements that tend to introduce a dislocation dipole , i.e.  localised _ defect precursor _ modes and @xmath3 this contribution is separated by a large gap from the next largest contribution , which represents other , more complicated deformations of @xmath0 . here",
    ", we continue the program initiated in  @xcite for a lattice structure that is the geometric dual of the triangular lattice , namely , the planar honeycomb ( phc ) crystal .",
    "while emphasising that our work is not necessarily specific to any particular material , we must mention that there are , indeed , compelling reasons to study the phc lattice .",
    "this decade s two most ground - breaking materials , with tremendous technological applications are graphene  @xcite and hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) films  @xcite .",
    "they are known to be flat mono - layers of atoms arranged in the form of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice .",
    "apart from these , the phc lattice appears in many other atomic and macro - molecular systems such as confined water  @xcite , assemblies of patchy colloids  @xcite and nano - particles  @xcite .",
    "mechanical properties of lattice defects in these materials play a major role in deciding their applicability in various facets of the industry .",
    "defects not only determine strength but also influence the topological characteristics of 2d sheets by coupling to the local curvature , leading to rolling up of 2d sheets into tubes and spheres or the creation of ripples on the surface  @xcite .",
    "obtaining greater insight into the physics of such defects in the phc lattice is therefore crucial to our understanding of these features exhibited by graphene and similar materials .    as an example , consider the stone - wales  @xcite ( sw ) topological defect observed in @xmath4-bonded carbon materials as well as in boron nitride nanotubes and nanosheets  @xcite .",
    "a sw defect is formed due to an in - plane rotation of a carbon - carbon bond by 90with respect to the bond center , resulting in bond reconstruction and eventual transformation of four hexagons into two heptagons and two pentagons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_transformation ] ) .",
    "the sw defects play a significant role in the formation of various carbon nanostructures , through local amorphization of graphene sheets  @xcite .",
    "they are also known to influence the electronic  @xcite as well as transport properties  @xcite of graphene , which can be exploited in the development of carbon - based electronic devices .        in this paper",
    "we focus on lattice deformations of the ideal phc crystal with the specific objective of identifying non - affine localised modes which act as precursors to the formation of topological defects",
    ". a description of lattice defects in terms of local non - affine displacements may be useful for many reasons .",
    "firstly , there is some evidence that non - affine displacements are associated with defect nucleation  @xcite and may act as a predictor for its appearance .",
    "secondly , this is a natural choice for describing processes such as amorphization where a solid breaks down by the proliferation of lattice defects  @xcite .",
    "lastly , this may prove to be a common language for describing mechanical deformation in both crystalline and amorphous matter .",
    "we begin by generalising the coarse - graining procedure introduced in  @xcite to derive exact statistics of the non - affinity parameter @xmath5 quantifying non - affine displacement fluctuations in the phc lattice . examining the nature of the localised vibrational modes responsible for producing @xmath5 , we discover that one of the largest contributions to @xmath5 arises from a mode that appears as a precursor to the sw topological defect .",
    "as expected , non affine fluctuations in general and the sw precursor mode in particular increase in amplitude as the solid is made softer .",
    "we also show that in the same limit , correlations between sw precursor fluctuations become stronger : the correlation length increases and so does the lifetime of these fluctuations . spatial correlations between sw precursor modes are also strongly anisotropic and therefore encourage clustering , producing cascades of sw distortions of the kind described in  @xcite .",
    "our results may be explicitly confirmed by direct use of video microscopy  @xcite on patchy colloids .",
    "these form phc lattices , and the interaction strength may be varied using surface modifications  @xcite .",
    "some of our results may also have implications for the mechanical behaviour and amorphization of graphene as discussed later .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe in detail the process by which we identify non - affine fluctuations of a coarse graining region in the phc lattice . in order to obtain explicit and analytic results and to make our calculations generic",
    ", we use a simple parametrisation of the particle interactions in terms of harmonic nearest neighbour ( nn ) and next near neighbour ( nnn ) harmonic bonds .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that for small fluctuations any realistic interaction may be mapped onto a harmonic solid . in section 3",
    ", we describe our results for the single point and two point statistics of defect precursors .",
    "we end the paper with a summary of our main results and conclusions .",
    "at any non - zero temperature @xmath6 , atomic displacements fluctuate from their reference , ideal lattice positions with amplitudes determined by their interactions . given any sub - volume @xmath0 within the solid , these fluctuations may be either _ affine _ or _ non - affine_. the former case represents fluctuations that simply deform the entire sub - volume uniformly . in two dimensions ,",
    "there are only four such affine transformations possible : a uniform change in volume , a uniaxial strain , a shear or a uniform rotation .",
    "if the number of particles within the sub - volume is larger than three , then there is a possibility of deformation modes which are non - affine , i.e.  can not be described by a linear combination of the four simple affine transformations of @xmath0 .",
    "the statistics of these non - affine displacements have previously been obtained for the one dimensional chain and the two dimensional triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that dominant non - affine fluctuations in the triangular lattice correspond to specific atomic displacements that tend to produce lattice defects  @xcite .",
    "we now use the ideas introduced in  @xcite and  @xcite to obtain the spatio - temporal statistics of non - affine fluctuations in the planar honeycomb ( phc ) structure .     of the phc lattice , marked in green .",
    "the central basis atoms ( orange , labelled @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) possess 12 neighbors ( blue ) within this domain .",
    "the nearest neighbor bonds are indicated by bold lines while the next nearest neighbor bonds for one of the central basis particles are shown by dotted lines .",

    "the inset defines the high symmetry directions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the brillouin zone .",
    "note that _ all _ the modes soften as @xmath15 decreases . as @xmath16 , the shear modulus vanishes and the transverse acoustic branch becomes unstable ( @xmath17 ) at small @xmath18 .",
    ", width=491 ]    [ fig : coarse_graining_volume ]    we start by defining a simple set of interactions that can stabilise a phc lattice . these can not be standard central force potentials as these usually lead to closed packed solids such as the triangular lattice in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "open lattices need strongly orientation dependent potentials . in atomic and molecular systems",
    "this is due to covalent or hydrogen bonds .",
    "for example , modelling of properties of carbon based materials is generally performed using bond - order , short - ranged empirical potentials such as the brenner  @xcite and tersoff  @xcite potentials .",
    "similar potentials are also used to model water  @xcite . in colloidal solids ,",
    "one requires patchy interactions , i.e.  heterogeneities on the surface of the colloid particles that produce angle dependent forces  @xcite . here , in order to obtain results that are sufficiently generic , we use a phc network of particles connected by harmonic bonds , noting that _ all _ interactions are harmonic in the limit of small fluctuations .",
    "accordingly , we assume the following general hamiltonian , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the momentum and displacement ( from the ideal reference ) of particle @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the particle mass and @xmath24 is the stiffness of the harmonic bond between particles @xmath22 and @xmath25 . it is well known that a phc lattice with only nn interactions is unstable  @xcite .  to make the lattice mechanically stable , we need to add either nnn bonds between the particles or include an energy for bond bending . in this work , we choose the former path although we have checked that the two methods give qualitatively the same results .",
    "we therefore set @xmath26 if @xmath27 form a nn pair and @xmath28 if they are next nearest neighbours .",
    "all other @xmath24 are set to zero .",

    "we therefore set them to unity in the following .",
    "for the coarse - graining analysis it will be useful to have the interaction energy written in a more generic form that makes it easy to switch to a representation in terms of fourier modes .",

    "[ rho - s - t ] , shows that the anisotropy in the sw precursor correlations increases with time .",
    "this may be interpreted as implying that sw defects are nucleated in cascades  @xcite , which enables these defects to proliferate during amorphization  @xcite  at which point the harmonic theory breaks down .",
    "how does external stress @xmath192 influence @xmath5 and the sw precursors ? to answer this question one only needs to include  @xcite the term @xmath193 in the hamiltonian ( [ harm ] ) , where @xmath194 is the best - fit _ local _ strain , @xmath195 , at particle @xmath22 . to lowest order in @xmath192 , the variation of @xmath5 is then @xmath196 , where the dependence on @xmath22 enters in @xmath165 via the relative displacement between the location where stress is applied , @xmath197 , and the location where we are measuring @xmath5 , say @xmath198 .",
    "the probability @xmath108 remains gaussian with the same variance but now the @xmath199 symmetry of @xmath138 is broken and @xmath108 is shifted with a mean @xmath200 .",
    "stress , @xmath192 , also does not affect the space - time correlation functions of @xmath138 .",
    "the density of sw defects will be modified , though , by curvature terms  @xcite arising from out of plane fluctuations that have not been included in our calculation .",
    "curvature then acts as an external field coupling to @xmath5 and @xmath138 .",
    "the effect of external fields on @xmath5 has been studied in the context of the triangular lattice  @xcite and should lead to similar results here .    since microscopic and instantaneous atomic coordinates are indeed difficult to obtain for systems such as graphene and h - bn , we believe that our predictions may be tested in future using video microscopic data  @xcite on patchy colloids  @xcite that form a phc lattice .",
    "similar experiments have been successfully carried out in simpler colloids  @xcite so it would be interesting to see results for the more complex phc structure .    in future",
    "we would like to investigate the three dimensional fcc lattice where a similar association of non - affine displacements with defects has been observed  @xcite . in three dimensional close packed solids ,",
    "the elementary topological defect is a small dislocation loop which may be difficult to identify using a burgers circuit for a fluctuating crystal at @xmath201 .",
    "however , local non - affinity should remain an easily recognised marker .",
    "analysis of non - affine modes in progressively disordered solids should also elucidate the connection , if any , between topological defects in crystals and non - affine droplet fluctuations or shear transformation zones in amorphous matter  @xcite .",
