    "chirality is a structural property of systems lacking mirror symmetry .",
    "almost all biomolecules are chiral ( proteins , nucleic acids , sugars , etc . ) and many artificial materials currently employed in advanced photonic applications are also chiral ( carbon nanotubes and graphene @xcite and metamaterials @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the interest toward this kind of materials is justified by their peculiar optical properties , collectively defined as optical activity. @xcite the optical activity of a chiral sample strongly depends on the intimate details of its molecular stucture and therefore it represents a fine tool to probe electronic and molecular structure .",
    "for this reason , optical techniques , such as circular dichroism ( cd ) have been routinely employed to determine conformational and structural properties of these systems , for example in the assessment of secondary structures of proteins and other biologically relevant molecules @xcite as well as the non - symmetric arrangement of pigments in light harvesting complexes .",
    "@xcite if one then consider that biological and artificial systems typically undergo time - dependent ultrafast structural changes during physical or chemical processes , the possibility of including an additional time - dependent dimension in conventional cd would also open the possibility of following how such ultrafast conformational dynamics affect the mechanism of relevant electronic processes .",
    "moreover , chiral signals originate from components of a system response function which are independent of the achiral ones .",
    "hence these signals provide independent information , which can be used to better determine chromophore structures and remove ambiguity about the origins of signals observed in achiral time - resolved experiments .    despite their recognized potential , the full development of ultrafast",
    "time - resolved chiral techniques and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) analogous has been strongly limited by the fact that chiral signals are typically three to four orders of magnitude weaker than achiral contributions @xcite .",
    "this is problematic experimentally , as any chiral contributions can be obscured by even small contributions from achiral signals .",
    "moreover most of the methods rely on differential measures ( i.e. obtained by determining the difference between signals generated by using left- and right - handed light ) and therefore are particularly prone to background noise fluctuations",
    ".    very few examples of time - resolved optical activity measures can be found in the literature .",
    "after the pioneering work of kliger s group , @xcite time - dependent chiral signals have been used to investigate the dynamic of structural changes in molecules and biomolecules @xcite , and vibrational optical activity@xcite .",
    "there has also been a great deal of theoretical interest in using full chiral two - dimensional spectroscopy to better resolve cross peaks  @xcite , study vibrational optical activity  @xcite , geometric fluctuations  @xcite and coherence beating  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of extending chiral measurements not only in the ultrafast time domain but also to multidimensional techniques has been recently explored .",
    "the implementation of chiral sensitive schemes in 2d spectroscopy allowed characterizing the exciton delocalization following photoexcitation , and the evolution of coherent superpositions involving states with negligible transition dipole moments.@xcite chiral 2d techniques could potentially merge together the sensitivity of cd measures to structural changes , with the capability of 2d spectroscopy to detect coherent dynamics in energy migration , unveiling important details about how structural motions affect transport phenomena in biological or artificial multi - chromophores systems .",
    "a wider application of chiral 2d techniques require however the development of experimental schemes able to efficiently isolate chiral signal from the more intense achiral contribution , thus enhancing measurements sensitivity and robustness against background noise .",
    "chiral signals can ( in theory ) always be isolated by using left and right circularly polarized pulses and comparing the two signals , or by numerically subtracting a known achiral component .",
    "however , circularly polarized light is experimentally more challenging , and numerical subtraction requires noise levels below that of the final signal .",
    "linear polarization control is simpler and is present in many existing 2d electronic spectroscopy ( 2des ) setups , it is used within non - chiral experiments to isolate off - diagonal and coherence contributions@xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to find ways to remove the non - chiral contributions at the single shot level ( requiring no subtractions of weak signals ) and requiring only linear polarization , which can be used in actual 2des configurations .    in this work",
    "we derive sets of polarizations for which the achiral contributions to 2des signals will cancel exactly in experimental configurations which are not co - planar .",
    "the exact polarizations required depend on whether they are implemented in the boxcars  @xcite or grapes  @xcite ( gradient assisted photon echo spectroscopy ) configurations .",
    "the boxcars setup guarantees full phase matching and is the more commonly used configuration .",
    "grapes manipulates a phase mismatch to allow single shot measurements , reducing the impact of amplitude noise in lasers@xcite .",
    "this work is divided into three sections .",
    "section [ sec : iso_av ] describes the interaction with light and matter in the dipole and higher order multipole approximations and outlines the orientation averages which must be minimized , within the constraints set by our two chosen experimental geometries .",
    "section [ sec : canceling ] derives analytic approximations for solutions in each case , which achieve cancellations of the achiral signal with minimal shifts to the polarizations compared with a fully parallel configuration .",
    "finally section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our results and conclusions .",
    "the interaction of matter with electromagnetic radiation is usually treated with a multipole expansion of electron positions within the system of interest . in the case of a multichromophore aggregate",

    "the signals measured will correspond to that of an ensemble averaged over all molecular orientations .      within a nonlinear spectroscopy experiment , the medium , which we describe in terms of a density matrix @xmath21",
    "is excited by a series of coherent laser pulses .",
    "the medium then generates a new electric field through its own polarization , which is equal to @xmath22 within the dipole approximation .",
    "the dipole approximation is generally sufficient for the achiral signal component . to calculate chiral contributions",
    ", we must also include the magnetization and the quadrupole contributions to the polarization .",
    "we can expand the time dependent density matrix perturbatively in @xmath23 ( see for example @xcite ) , giving @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25th order term produces the @xmath25th order polarization @xmath26 .",
    "two dimensional spectroscopy is a third order technique and hence we have @xmath27 .",

    "appendix  [ si:2des ] includes a note expanding on the principles of 2des .    as we mentioned before , our macroscopic polarization is proportional to an ensemble average of all molecular orientations rather than a single molecule .",

    "[ sec : foia ] .",
    "our final signal is obtained by heterodyne detection with another electric field @xmath34 from a `` local oscillator '' ( lo ) pulse , hence @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{eq : hetdet}\\ ] ] the signal depends on the scalar product of the polarization and lo field , and hence we can control which element(s ) of the polarization field we actually measure . when only parallel linear polarizations are used for the electric field which provide the @xmath25 interactions ,",
    "say along the @xmath20 axis , an isotropic achiral medium produce a polarization only along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "however , chiral media can produce a nonlinear polarization with a component orthogonal to these field ( say , along the @xmath18 axis ) .",
    "if the lo is polarized along @xmath20 , then this `` chiral '' contribution will be lost and only the achiral contribution measured . where as , if the lo is polarized along @xmath18 instead , only the `` chiral '' contribution is measured .",
    "notice also that the phase of the local oscillator relative to the other pulses is also used for selecting the real and imaginary parts of the signal field .",
    "the chiral contribution is present regardless of whether we measure it .",
    "this therefore makes the polarization of the lo a valid parameter to consider in our analysis .",
    "we should note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hetdet ] ) neglects terms proportional to @xmath36 , as the induced signal field is typically far weaker than lo electric field .",
    "this assumption is still expected to be valid when we are selecting the ( much weaker ) part of the signal field which is present only due the chirality of the medium .",
    "the achiral component of our signal in 2des is proportional to @xmath37 , averaged over all global orientations of our system . to make evaluating these rotation averages easier , we can expand the electric dipole operator into components for each dipole allowed transition @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote , respectively , the ground and excited states of the @xmath41th chromophore of our system and @xmath42 denote two - exciton states .",
    "analogous expansions can be presented for the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moment operators . within this expansion , all terms which contribute to the achiral ( electric dipole transitions only )",
    "signal can be broken down into terms which only depend on the internal dynamics of the system , with prefactors which are isotropic averages of the form @xmath43 only @xmath27 terms contribute significantly for a third order technique such as 2des .",
    "analogous expressions can be derived for the terms contributing to the chiral component . in that case",
    "the electric dipoles in eq.([eq : isotropic_av_prefactor ] ) are replaced with a magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole moment .",

    "additionally we have @xmath56 a three component vector , each element of which controls the amount each linearly independent component of @xmath57 contributes to the signal using the chosen set of polarizations .",

    "there are many possible solutions which achieve this .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath61 along with any arbitrary values for the remaining angles @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "such a differential spectroscopy can be performed in any experimental geometry , regardless of the angles between the wavevectors of each pulse . however , linearly polarized ( lp ) pulses are simpler to implement experimentally , hence we aim to determine how to perform chiral sensitive 2des using only lp light . as above - mentioned ,",
    "this is highly non - trivial as the condition @xmath73 must be satisfied . in order to formulate this constraint mathematically",

    ", we set each component of the vector @xmath83 to zero and find the pulse rotations @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for which this conditions is satisfied .",
    "this is in general not a simple problem as there can be many solutions for which these vector components will be zero i.e. we have four angles and only three equations to set to zero . the simplest example to consider has all @xmath28 along @xmath74 ( colinear ) .",
    "we then have solutions whenever one of the four pulses is polarized orthogonal to the others ( e.g.  @xmath87 along @xmath18 and all others along @xmath20 or @xmath88 ) , which gives four solutions plus a continuous degree of freedom , as we can make an arbitrary rotation about the @xmath74 axis on all @xmath54 without actually changing anything since the system is isotropic .",
    "notice also that the minus factors in the polarizations are equivalent to a relative phase shift of @xmath89 to the other beams .",
    "these four configurations cancel all the achiral components in all the 2des signal components and will all result in different , purely chiral signals .",

    "@xcite ) of the pump ( with polarization control ) and a babinet - soleil compensator  @xcite .",

    "in general , however , 2des is not always performed in a totally colinear or coplanar configuration as it is not possible to separately measure the rephasing , non - rephasing and coherence contributions .",
    "these contributions must instead be separated numerically via subtraction and phase - cycling  @xcite .",
    "this separation will be more technically demanding for chiral spectroscopy , as high amplitude achiral components would also need to be subtracted to leave a low amplitude chiral signal .",
    "here we focus instead on configurations which are close to colinear , such as boxcars and grapes , and that have non - trivial solutions for which the achiral response vanishes . as these configurations can be seen as small deviations from colinear geometries we consider perturbatively changing from a colinear geometry , which leads to the rotation @xmath77 being the small parameter . in this way we can start with a solution to the colinear geometry ( @xmath94 ) , for example",

    ", we use the symbolic toolbox in matlab ( equivalent to the mupad interface ) .",
    "it would also be possible to derive the solutions by hand or using any other computer algebra program .",
    "we note that as the medium is chiral , it can exhibit optical rotatory dispersion and cause the polarizations of the pulses to rotate and the angles between them will change . we show in appendix  [ si : cwsnt ] that such effects will be negligible so long as the sample is not optically thick , which is a condition in general expected for non - linear spectroscopy .",

    "for this reason it is important to consider the sensitivity of these achiral signal minimizing solutions to small errors in the polarization controls .",
    "even with ( uniform ) random deviations of a single arcminute to the polarization rotations away from our ideal values , chiral contributions become significant . in fig[fig : hist_error ] we plot a histogram of the achiral contributions with random noise .",

    "we have put forward a technique that allows full cancelation of the non - chiral signal and therefore isolate a pure chiral contribution to signals in typical 2des geometries of non - colinear experiments , namely the boxcar and grapes configurations .",
    "our scheme relies in modifying three colinear polarization schemes . in a truly colinear / coplanar 2des geometry",
    ", these three polarization schemes would result in three linearly - independent chiral signals .",
    "we find that it is possible to derive polynomial expansions using the angles between the beams and the @xmath74 axis to make any achiral contribution arbitrarily small , such that it can be neglected to obtain a pure chiral signal .",
    "this is of signficant experimental relevance as achiral contributions can dominate the 2des signals in typical configurations making difficult to measure the chiral response .",
    "these modifications to the polarizations of the beams as the geometry is warped , also modify the chiral contribution to the signal .",
    "therefore , signals relating to the other two linearly - independent colinear configurations will contribute , along with some non - colinear configurations .",
    "the changes are of order @xmath205 , with @xmath77 the angles between the beams and the @xmath74 axis ( the direction in which the nonlinear signal grows ) , and so these changes can be neglected when @xmath206 . if this is not the case , these changes would need to be considered in the analysis of data obtained from the boxcars or grapes configurations . however , this would not present significant complications in terms of the analysis .",

    "as our sample is chiral , our electric field polarizations will vary depending on the distance propagated through the sample , and change for different frequency .",
    "such changes will mean the pulses no longer strictly obey the orthogonality conditions we require to eliminate achiral signals .",
    "therefore we should determine whether this effect is significant in an experimental configuration .",
