    "@xmath0al  is a radioactive nuclide that can be produced by hydrostatic nucleosynthesis in h burning regions , by explosive nucleosynthesis and by spallation .",
    "its half  life time in its ground state is of @xmath1 yr , and it is thus a good tracer of recent nucleosynthetic events in the galaxy . + the maps obtained with comptel ( diehl et al .",
    "1995 , kndlseder et al . 1999 ,",
    "plschke et al . 2001 ) allowed to pin down the main contributors to the diffuse emission observed mainly in the galactic plane : massive stars ( prantzos & diehl 1996 , kndlseder 1999 ) .",
    "these objects end their lives with a supernova explosion , during which @xmath0al  can be synthesized and will eventually be expelled ( heger et al .",
    "the more massive ( and shorter lived ) ones will also contribute during quiescent evolutionary phases through their winds .",
    "wolf - rayet ( hereafter wr ) stars are the bare cores of massive o  type stars that lost their hydrogen rich envelope due to very strong stellar winds or by mass transfer in a close binary system .",
    "they exhibit at their surface the products of the internal nuclesoynthesis accompanying first the central h  burning ( wn phase ) and then central he  burning phase ( wc and wo phases ) . at solar metallicity ,",
    "all stars more massive than about 30  go through a wr phase , which typically lasts for a few @xmath2 years in the case of non - rotating objects ( meynet & maeder 2003 ; 2004 ) , and massively contribute to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( hereafter ism ) .",
    "+ @xmath0al  is synthesized during the central h  burning phase in these stars , and is eventually ejected into the ism as the star is peeled off by strong winds during the wr phase .",
    "the amount of @xmath0al  ejected in the ism through winds is very sensitive to mass loss rates , metallicity , rotation and initial mass .",
    "meynet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented a first study of the effects of initial mass and metallicity , as well as the effects of different possible prescriptions for convection . at that time",
    ", they could already show that the amount of @xmath0al  ejected increases with metallicity and initial mass . in the grid of models used by meynet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , artificially twice enhanced mass loss rates were used , which appeared at that time to better fit the observed properties of the wr stars in a series of environments ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) .    in the following , we present the results obtained for a new grid of models including rotation and updated mass loss prescriptions for the different evolutionary phases that massive stars are likely to go through .",
    "part of these results were discussed in vuissoz et al .",
    "massive stars are known to have high equatorial velocities ( @xmath3v@xmath4 = 200  250 ) while on main sequence .",
    "such a rotation affects the evolution of stars in several ways .",
    "it first has a direct incidence on its structure through the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "it also affects the mass loss in terms of geometry and quantity .",
    "finally it triggers instabilities in the radiative interior of the star , which allow transport of angular momentum and chemical species .",
    "transport of angular momentum and chemical species is ensured by the meridional circulation , which settles in to balance the thermal desequilibrium induced by the departure from spherical symetry in rotating objects , and by the shear instability associated with the turbulent layers in regions with high angular velocity gradients ( zahn 1992 ; maeder & zahn 1998 ) .",
    "we chose an initial velocity @xmath5 300   for all masses and metallicities , taking into account that this value is compatible with the mean averaged observed velocity of o - type stars at solar metallicity . considering this , the rotating models used here well reproduce a series of observed features for o - type and wr stars , that non  rotating models fail to fit ( meynet & maeder 2004 ) .",
    "al  ejected by wr stellar winds at twice the solar metallicity .",
    "continuous line show the case of rotating models , dotted lines the case of non  rotating models .",
    "the short - dashed lines and the long  dashed lines show the evolution as a function of time of the cumulated mass of `` live '' @xmath0al  , _ i.e. _ of still non ",
    "decayed @xmath0al  , for rotating and non  rotating cases respectively .. ,width=302,height=302 ]        the effects of rotation on @xmath0al  production in wr stars are consequences of both the effects on the mass loss and of the rotation induced mixing .",
    "the main results for what concerns @xmath0al  are the following :    * at given metallicity , rotation allows stars with lower initial masses to enter the wr phase .",
    "when we take stellar rotation into account ( which is an observational fact ) , the number of stars contributing to the @xmath0al  enrichment of the ism through stellar winds is thus increased .",
    "the total contribution of wr stars to the galactic content of @xmath0al  is larger when using rotating models than when using non  rotating ones , as can be seen in fig . 3 , and as will be discussed in the next section . * at given mass and metallicity , rotation results in an entrance into the wr phase at an earlier evolutionary stage ( not necessarily at an earlier time ) .",
    "for instance the solar metallicity 60 m@xmath6 star model enters the wr phase during the core he  burning phase when it is non  rotating and during the end of the core h  burning phase when it is rotating . in this last case",
    "the duration of the wr phase is longer so that the cumulative time interval during which @xmath0al  is expelled is larger for rotating stars .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the @xmath0al  yields .",
    "this is well illustrated in figs . 1 and 2 where the evolution of the cumulated mass of @xmath0al  is shown as a function of time for both rotating and non  rotating models . * the higher the metallicity , the larger the ejected mass of @xmath0al  ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 ) .",
    "+ this is due to the metallicity dependence of mass loss rates and to the higher @xmath7 mass fraction available for @xmath0al   synthesis at higher metallicity .",
    "* rotation allows surface enrichment of @xmath0al  prior to the wr phase .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the combined effects of meridional circulation and turbulence which allow @xmath0al  to diffuse outwards from the convective core , where it is produced by proton capture on @xmath8 , up to the radiative envelope , and to appear earlier at the surface of the star .",
    "one can evaluate the contribution of wr stars to the total galactic mass of @xmath0al  in the following way : @xmath9 r is the galactic radius taken equal to 15 kpc . + @xmath10 is the surface density distribution of atomic and molecular hydrogen according to scoville & sanders ( 1987 ) .",
    "this quantity is used to mimic the present star formation rate in the galaxy , provided that the molecular clouds distribution is considered a good tracer of the star forming regions .",
    "+ @xmath11 is the minimum mass for a star to enter the wr phase at a given metallicity .",
    "its dependence on initial velocity and initial metallicity is explicitely taken into account .",
    "+ @xmath12 is the initial mass function , @xmath13 defining the slope of the imf . here",
    ", two different prescriptions were used , in order to show the impact of this physical ingredient on the global production of @xmath0al  by wr stars .",
    "+ @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , r , z ) is the yield of @xmath0al  ( excluding the supernova contribution ) for a given mass @xmath15 at a given metallicity z.    the expression in eqn .",
    "1 is normalized so as to account for a rate of 3 snae per century in the galaxy ( e.g. capellaro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "+ furthermore , we considered a metallicity gradient along the galactic radius such as z = 0.04 for r @xmath16 4 kpc , and d log(z)/dr = -0.07 dex.kpc@xmath17 beyond , with the condition that z = 0.02 at r = 8.5 kpc ( solar neighbourhood ) .    in fig .",
    "3 , we can see that the radial surface density profile of @xmath0al  has a similar shape whether we use rotating or non - rotating models",
    ". in particular , in both cases there is a peak between 4 kpc and 6 kpc associated with the existence of the molecular clouds ring at 5 kpc , which is accounted for in the expression of the surface density distribution @xmath10 .    *",
    "the rotating models lead to a larger contribution of wr stars to the @xmath0al   surface density profile in the inner 8 kpc ring . there , z @xmath18 , and as seen in fig . 1 and fig",
    "2 , the combined effects of metallicity and rotation lead to a substantial enhancement of the yields . * the total mass of @xmath0al  originating from wr stars",
    "is increased by a factor 2.5 to 2.9 when rotation is taken into account .",
    "the values obtained are also quite sensitive to the imf slope , the salpeter imf ( @xmath19 ) favouring a larger contribution , even though the scalo imf ( @xmath20 ) is considered better suited for massive stars .",
    "* for an imf slope of 1.7 , we obtain a total ejected mass of @xmath0al  by wr stars of 1.27   in case of rotating models , which represents 42% to 63 % of the total observed mass , that is estimated to range between 2 and 3 .    according to the recent observations by rhessi ( a @xmath21-ray observatory for the sun which was able to measure the diffuse emission of both @xmath0al  and @xmath22 ) , the new estimate derived for the line ratio @xmath23 ( see smith s contribution in these proceedings ) is consistent with the value predicted by timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , from computations including the sole contribution of type ii supernovae ( snii ) .",
    "this would designate snii as the dominant contributors to the @xmath0al  galactic content .",
    "however , the most recent computations of nucleosynthesis from snii indicate that the line ratio @xmath24 should be larger than about 0.4 .",
    "if this is the case , as pointed out by prantzos ( 2004 ; see also his contribution in these proceedings ) , @xmath0al  should , at least up to a 50 % level , originate from sources that produce @xmath0al  but do not produce @xmath22 , as is the case for the wr stars .",
    "our results show that rotating stellar models of wr stars could actually be responsible for such an amount of @xmath0al  .",
    "let us stress however , that this result has to be taken with caution , considering the 2.6 sigma level of the rhessi detection of @xmath25 and the large uncertainties existing on the physical parameters entering the derivation of such a quantity ( see also palacios et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "we have presented new results concerning @xmath0al  production by wr stars from a new grid of models including rotation and updated physics , in particular the most recent prescriptions for mass loss rates .",
    "+ taking rotation into account globally leads to an enhancement of wind ejected mass of @xmath0al  by very massive stars . + convolved with appropriate imf and star formation rate indicator , these yields lead to a total mass of about 1.3  of @xmath0al  originating from wr stellar winds .",
    "this value is in agreement with the conclusions drawn by prantzos ( 2004 ) from recent measurements of the line flux ratio @xmath26 ."
