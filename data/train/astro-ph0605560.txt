    "the h@xmath1 variability in a large sample of o stars was reproduced by a wind model consisting of coherent shells @xcite .",
    "the empirical mass - loss estimates shall be generally reduced by factors of a few in clumped winds @xcite . from a study of fuv spectra of 40 galactic o - stars",
    "it was concluded that their mass - loss rates should be reduced by up to one order of magnitude due to wind clumping @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the x - ray emission line profiles from @xmath2  ori , , and   @xcite has shown that the attenuation by the stellar wind is significantly smaller than expected from homogeneous wind models .",
    "the observed attenuation of x - rays in the massive binary @xmath3vel is much weaker than expected from smooth stellar wind models , implying strong wind clumping @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were reached from the x - ray observations of wr140 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission line spectra of several wind - fed high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) can be explained as originating in a wind where cool dense clumps are embedded in rarefied photoionized gas @xcite .",
    "the stochastic variability of x - ray light - curve observed by _ xmm - newton _   in 4u  1700 - 37 were explained as the result of the neutron star feeding by a strongly clumped stellar wind @xcite .",
    "clumping of the stellar wind is thought to be a consequence of the intrinsic instability of the radiative - driving mechanism @xcite .",
    "the 1d hydrodynamic modeling predicts that line - driven stellar winds are strongly inhomogeneous , starting from close to the photosphere @xcite .",
    "strong gas compression leads to the formation of cool clumps .",
    "the space between clumps is essentially void , but small gas parcels are ablated from the clumps and accelerated to high speed .",
    "when a parcel catches up and rams into the next outer clump , the gas is heated and emits thermal x - rays .",
    "the x - rays propagate trough the wind and suffer absorption by the cool clumped component of the wind . gets .",
    "thus the wind consists of two disjunctive components : hot ( @xmath4k ) gas parcels emitting x - rays and compressed cool ( @xmath5k ) fragments that attenuate this radiation .",
    "radiative transfer in a clumped wind is different from transfer in a homogeneous wind @xcite .",
    "formation of x - ray emission lines in clumped winds of massive stars was extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "the main findings of these studies are    - the opacity in a clumped wind is reduced compared to a homogeneous wind of the same mass - loss rate .    - the wavelength - dependence of the opacity is weaker in clumped winds ; if clumps are optically thick , the opacity becomes grey .",

    "the line profiles observed in x - ray spectra of single o stars can be reproduced in the framework of a clumped wind model .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] shows model line profiles for smooth and clumped winds .",
    "two models of clumped wind are shown : the wind which consists of the spherical and of the flattened clumps .",
    "the line flux in the fig .  [ fig : sfh ] is normalized such that it is unity for a line which is not affected by absorption . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] the emergent flux in the line is lower in a smooth wind that in a clumped wind model .",
    "it is assumed that the total number of clumps in the wind is constant .",
    "clumps form at random times near some inner boundary and propagate radially according to a monotonically increasing velocity law .",
    "an average time separation between clumps is equal to the wind flow time @xmath6hr .",
    "the line profiles are affected by the assumed clump geometry .",
    "a model with spherical clumps assumes that the optical depth across a clump has no angular dependence ( see @xcite ) .",
    "slab - like clump models assume clumps , that are geometrically thin and aligned . in the latter model",
    "the optical depth across the clump is angular - dependent ( see @xcite ) and the resulting line profile is more symmetric .",
    "future 2d hydrodynamic models will shed new light on the clump geometry .",
    "while our 2d clumped - wind model is used to calculate the formal radiative transfer , the opacity of the cool medium is obtained with the potsdam wolf - rayet ( powr ) non - lte code.wrh/powr/powrgrid1.html ] shown in fig.[fig : zpmod ] is the observed fuse spectrum of   with overplotted model .",
    "the model and observations are flux - calibrated .",
    "an x - ray field of the observed level has been included in the model to fit the observations . as can be seen in fig.[fig : zpmod ] the p  cyg line profile of ovi is nicely reproduced by the model .",
    "it was the presence of such high ions as ovi observed in o - star spectra , which led cassinelli & olson @xcite to postulate the presence of x - rays in stellar winds , prior to their actual discovery . in agreement with this classical work , our state - of - the - art model",
    "can not reproduce the observed ovi line unless in the presence of x - rays .    the scattering by the resonance ovi line in the wind is needed to be taken into account for the analysis of the @xmath7 ratio between forbidden and intercombination lines in helium - like mgxi @xcite .",
    "the transition between @xmath8 levels at @xmath9  is between ovi doublet at @xmath10   and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the full radiative transfer is needed to evaluate the effect of radiation field on the lines ratio in helium - like ions .",
    "this is fully accounted for in our atmosphere models .    from the line ratios in helium - like ions observed by _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _   in  we infer the x - ray formation region to be located approximately between @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the radii of formation obtained independently from line profile fits .",
    "detailed analysis of the forbidden - to - intercombination line ratios in , , @xmath14ori , and @xmath2ori is presented in @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the archival rgs spectra of .",

    "as can be seen , the ratio of oviii ly@xmath15 is consistent with a plasma temperature of @xmath16kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the strength of ovii helium - like line indicates presence of a @xmath17kev plasma .",
    "importantly , the level of continuum seen in this high quality spectrum is in agreement with the inferred plasma temperatures .",
    "continuum was only marginally detected in previous less sensitive observations @xcite and its alleged weakness was used as an argument to support the idea , that the shocks in o star winds are collisionless ( rauw , pollock & naz , these proceedings ) .",
    "a recent study of collisionless damping in stellar winds shows that in rotating magnetized stars this mechanism can indeed be important @xcite .",
    "however , from both dynamic and energetic arguments it was demonstrated that it can operate effectively only in stars with spectral type b3v or later , but not in o stars @xcite .    in order to fit the observed line profiles we have added the observed level of continuum to the model lines .",
    "fig.[fig : ln ] shows the most prominent emission lines in the rgs spectrum .",
    "the model lines were obtained with our 2d clumped wind model @xcite .",
    "the region of x - ray line formation is constrained from an analysis of the _ fir _ line ratios in he - like ions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only free parameter in the modeling is the _",
    "fragmentation frequency_. our model assumes time averaged stationary mass - loss rate and the average number of clumps in the wind at a given moment of time is constant .",
    "the fragmentation frequency is an inverse time interval at which moving clumps are crossing some arbitrary reference radius in the wind @xcite .",
    "we prefer to use this parameter instead of _ porosity length _",
    "@xcite , since the latter is radius - dependent whereas the former is not .",
    "the model lines shown in fig.[fig : ln ] are obtained using mass - loss estimate which does not account for wind clumping @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation frequency for all models is @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to the inverse flow time , @xmath19 , in the wind of .",
    "using more realistic mass - loss rates that are smaller by a factor of few will result in slightly higher fragmentation frequency .",
    "the fexvii ( @xmath20 ) line is wide and can not be satisfactorily fitted unless the line formation region extends further out in the wind .",
    "we assumed here that the line is blended with fexix .",
    "the emissivity of fexix ( @xmath21 ) is about 30% of fexvii(@xmath20 ) , assuming a temperature @xmath22kev . in the most red part of the wing of fexvii , the emission from oviii ( @xmath23 ) is also likely to contribute .    the oviii ( @xmath24 ) is easily fitted with the present model of a clumped wind .",
    "several authors have noted that the profile of nvii ( @xmath25 ) is different from that of other lines @xcite .",
    "it was recently suggested that this line is blended with nvi ( @xmath26 ) @xcite . following this suggestion we model nvii line as a blend .",
    "assuming ionisation equilibrium , the ratio of nvi to nvii is sensitive to the temperature .",
    "fig.[fig : nvi ] shows the observed nvi triplet line .",
    "the measured ratio @xmath27 corresponds to a temperature @xmath28mk @xcite . at this temperature , the emissivity of nvi(@xmath26 ) is half of the emissivity of nvii(@xmath25 ) ( atomdb v.1.3.1 ) .",
    "using these values in clumped wind model , the resulting fit satisfactorily reproduces the nvii line width , as is shown in fig.[fig : ln ] .",
    "figure[fig : nvii ] shows three different _ xmm - newton _  observations of the nvii line and the sensitivity areas of rgs1 and rgs2 .",
    "ragged  structure of the line profile and the dip at @xmath29  is clearly seen in all data sets . while the depth of the dip is variable , its location is relatively constant .",
    "we employed powr model to study whether the absorption in the cool wind can cause the observed structure of the nvii line .",
    "nvii can be produced in the cool wind via auger ionisation of nv .",
    "however , our atmosphere models show that nvii is absent in the cool wind , even when assuming that the x - ray field is significantly stronger in  wind than observed .",
    "the line structure seen in nvii is typical for the optically thick lines in the winds of hot stars .",
    "fig.[fig : wr3 ] shows the optically thick heii line in the spectrum of wr3 , overplotted with the nvii line in s spectrum .",
    "the optical depths in the resonance lines of the most abundant ions in the hot x - ray emitting component of stellar winds can be larger than unity @xcite .",
    "nitrogen is overabundant in , while oxygen and carbon are depleted .",
    "we find that the optical depth in nvii line can be large enough to result in self - absorption .",
    "clumping of the stellar wind has a profound effect on x - ray emission from hmxbs @xcite .",
    "we studied the influence of clumping on photoionised regions . in the following",
    "we consider the case of optically thick clumps .",
    "the same notations as in @xcite are used .",
    "we assume that the wind consists of two components : dense clumps and a rarefied interclump medium . applying the continuity equation",
    "we define the mean particle number density as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is mean molecular weight and @xmath32 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "if the density enhancement in clumps is @xmath33 , and the volume filling factor of clumps is @xmath34 then the particle number density of the interclump gas is @xmath35 assume for simplicity that the interclump gas is optically thin and the velocity is constant . correcting the mean radiation intensity for the absorption in the clumps @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a function of atomic parameters and temperature , and @xmath38 is an effective optical depth . when all clumps are opaque ( @xmath39 ) , the effective optical depth reflects geometrical distribution of the clumps , and is found to be grey @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the fragmentation frequency . using the ionisation balance equation ,",
    "the ionisation parameter in the interclump medium is @xmath42 for a very high fragmentation frequency , which recovers the case of a smooth wind @xmath43 , eq.[eq : ksi ] reduces to the usual definition of @xmath44 .",
    "parameter @xmath45 @xcite in a clumped wind can be written as @xmath46 we conclude that clumping affects both the ionisation balance and the size of the photoionized region.a higher ionisation and a larger size of the photoionized region can be expected .    9    eversberg , t. , lpine , s. , moffat , a.f.j .",
