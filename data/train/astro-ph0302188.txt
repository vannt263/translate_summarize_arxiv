    "the dichotomy of radio emission from quasars has been a persistent hurdle in developing a general theoretical framework for the emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . whereas the powerful jets of relativistic particles are believed to be generic to the central engines of the radio - loud subset ( e.g.  antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) , the situation remains confused as to the existence of such jets in the radio - quiet majority of quasars ( e.g.  antonucci , barvainis , & alloin 1990 ; sopp & alexander 1991 ; terlevich et al .",

    "1997 ) are now generally linked to the presence of relativistic jets ( e.g.  marscher , gear , & travis 1992 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; noble et al .",
    "1997 ) . equally clear signatures of jets have been lacking for radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , despite several searches for inov in luminous rqqs ( gopal - krishna , wiita , & altieri 1993 ; gopal - krishna , sagar , & wiita 1995 ; de diego et al .",

    "although radio observations have revealed faint , aligned structures in a handful of rqqs ( miller , rawlings , & saunders 1993 ; kellermann et al.1994 ; papadopoulos et al .",

    "; blundell & rawlings 2001 ) the case for relativistic jets as a generic feature of rqqs remains unsettled ( sopp & alexander 1991 ; wilson & colbert 1995 ; stein 1996 ; kukula et al .",
    "1998 ) . in our earlier papers , statistical evidence for intranight optical fluctuations was presented for some rqqs ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "1995 , 2000 ; sagar , gopal - krishna , & wiita 1996 ) , but in no case was it overwhelmingly convincing .",
    "the results of several independent studies have been discrepant and hence inconclusive ( jang & miller 1995 , 1997 ; de diego et al .",
    "1998 ; rabbette et al .",
    "1998 ; romero , cellone & combi 1999 ) .",
    "jang & miller ( 1995 , 1997 ) claimed detection of inov in far more bl lacs than in radio - quiet agn from a heterogeneous sample . for the rqqs ton 951 and ton 1057 ,",
    "jang & miller ( 1995 , 1997 ) presented differential light curves ( dlcs ) showing up to @xmath1 variations on hour - like time scales .",
    "however , optical luminosities of both these agns are modest ( m@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath424.3 , taking @xmath5 km s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , and close to the critical value below which radio properties are thought to become like those of seyfert galaxies ( miller , peacock , & mead 1990 ) . at these lower levels of agn / galactic light ratios , false indications of variability , produced by seeing variations which include different amounts of host galactic light within the photometric aperture ,",
    "becomes very probable ( cellone , romero , & combi 2000 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) monitored a sample of 23 southern objects : 8 rqqs and 15 blazars .",
    "none of their 8 rqqs was clearly found to vary down to 1% rms , while 9 of their 15 blazars showed inov above that level .",
    "rabbette et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also failed to detect inov in a sample of 23 high luminosity rqqs , but their detection threshold was @xmath0 0.1 mag .",
    "in contrast to these tentative results implying little inov for rqqs , de diego et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded that microvariability is at least as common among rqqs ( 6 detections in 30 sessions ) as it is among the ( relativistically beamed ) core - dominated radio - loud quasars ( cdqs ) ( 5 in 30 ) , commonly deemed as blazars along with bl lacs .",
    "each of their 17 rqqs had a cdq counterpart of nearly matching brightness and redshift .",
    "the observational and analysis procedures of de diego et al .",
    "( 1998 ) differ radically from those of all other programs , including ours .",
    "they usually monitored each object only a few ( 39 ) times per night at intervals of @xmath030 minutes ; they divided each of these observations into 5 , roughly one - minute each , exposures .",
    "de diego et al .  (",
    "1998 ) used small ( @xmath8 ) apertures and estimated their errors through an analysis of variance technique which involved only one comparison star .",
    "compared to those of other groups , these techniques lead to less trustworthy results .",
    "motivated by the need to look for a signature of relativistic nuclear jets in intrinsically luminous , _ bona - fide _ rqqs , we launched in 1998 a program of r - band monitoring of seven sets of bright ( m@xmath2 @xmath0 16 ) agn , each set falling in a narrow redshift bin between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and consisting of a rqq , a bl lac ( except in the highest @xmath11 bin ) , a cdq and a radio lobe - dominated quasar .",
    "thus , the four agn classes in the sample are matched in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "we monitored each of the agn on @xmath13 nights , taking @xmath0 5 exposures per hour , for durations between 4 and 8 hours per night .",
    "this program required 113 nights during 19982002 , details of which are presented elsewhere ( stalin 2002 ; gopal - krishna et al . , in preparation ) . here",
    "we summarize the main results obtained for the rqqs and bl lacs over the course of 53 nights of observations ( table 1 ) .",
    "all seven rqqs are not only optically luminous , ( @xmath14 ) but also genuinely radio - quiet , with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the rest - frame ratio of 5 ghz to 250 nm flux densities ( stocke et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the r - band ccd observations were made using the 1.04-meter sampurnanand telescope of the state observatory , naini tal , india .",
    "at least two , but usually more , comparison stars , similar in brightness to the target agn were present on each ( bias subtracted , flat - fielded ) ccd frame .",
    "we derived differential light curves ( dlcs ) of the agn relative to these comparison stars and also for all the pairs of comparison stars .",
    "thus , we identified and discounted any comparison stars which themselves varied .",
    "photometry of the agn and the comparison stars was carried out using the same circular aperture , and the instrumental magnitudes were determined using the _ phot _ task in iraf .",
    "for each night a range of aperture radii was considered and the one that minimized the variance of the dlc of the steadiest comparison star pair was accepted .",
    "the typical aperture radius used was 4@xmath17 ; however , the dlcs are not very sensitive to the chosen radius .",
    "variations exceeding 0.01-mag over the night can be readily detected on these dlcs .",
    "fig .  1 shows the dlcs of two of the rqqs , 1029@xmath18329 ( @xmath19 ) and 1252@xmath18020 ( @xmath20 ) ( table 1 ) . in each case , the dlcs of the rqq against all three comparison stars ( top three panels ) are consistent in showing a gradual fading by @xmath21 over 45 hours , whereas the simultaneous dlcs involving the same three comparison stars are steady to within @xmath00.3% .",
    "conceivably , the decline in the dlcs of the rqqs could be an artifact of the color difference , @xmath22 , between the rqq and the comparison stars , leading to a differential attenuation with varying zenith distance ( i.e. , airmass ) .",
    "however , this possibility can be discounted , since no such systematic fading is evident on the star - star dlcs shown in the two bottom panels in fig .  1",
    ", for which the color difference is comparable to @xmath22 ( except for a brief flare seen near 17.3 ut in the dlc for the star pair s2@xmath4s1 , which is clearly attributable to a variation of star s2 ) .",
    "another potential caveat is that a systematic variation in the point spread function ( psf ) could have led to a varying contribution from the rqq host galaxy within the photometric aperture ( cellone et al .",
    "this possibility can also be excluded , since the host galaxy is expected to contribute @xmath23 of the flux of each of these luminous rqqs , and is also expected to be encompassed well within the @xmath24 aperture radius used .",
    "in addition , we have determined the psf for the successive ccd frames using the comparison stars and find that the psf actually narrowed progressively by @xmath25 over both of these nights .",
    "this implies that the actual fading of the two rqqs are marginally larger than those recorded on the dlcs ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed inov of these two rqqs , although small , is real .",
    "all these checks have not been employed in earlier studies , so these two cases with well resolved brightness gradients represent the clearest evidence reported so far for intranight variability of luminous rqqs .",
    "( similar reasoning is applicable to all the cases of inov reported here ) .",
    "the results for the rqqs and bl lacs in the sample are summarized in table 1 .",
    "there exists a wide discrepancy between the reported duty cycles ( dc ) of inov for rqqs _ vis - a - vis _ bl lac objects / blazars ( jang & miller 1997 ; de diego et al .",
    "1998 ; romero et al .  1999 ) .",
    "contributions to the dc are weighted by the number of hours ( in the rest - frame ) for which each source was monitored ( romero et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the duration ( corrected for cosmological redshift ) of a monitoring session of the source in the selected class ; @xmath28 equals 0 or 1 , if the object was non - variable or variable during @xmath29 , respectively .    for rqqs , counting only the sessions for which inov was positively detected ( table 1 ) , we find that dc = 17% .",
    "this can be compared with dc = 72% determined here for the bl lacs .",
    "our data also allow , for the first time , estimation of dc for different ranges of peak - to - peak variability amplitude , @xmath30^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath31 is the differential magnitude , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the factor by which the average of the measurement errors ( @xmath34 , as given by @xmath35 algorithm ) should be multiplied ; we find @xmath36 ( stalin 2002 ; gopal - krishna et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "all the rqqs have @xmath37 , and for @xmath37 , the dcs for bl lacs and rqqs are very similar .",
    "however , stronger inov , with @xmath38 , is exclusive to the bl lacs ( dc = 53% ) .",
    "still , we note our sample is small , and it would be very useful to have similarly sensitive and careful measurements of a larger number of matched pairs to allow more confident estimates of duty cycles and distributions of @xmath39 .    to quantify the variability , we have employed a statistical criterion based on the parameter @xmath40 , similar to that followed by jang & miller ( 1997 ) , with the added advantage that for each agn we have dlcs relative to multiple comparison stars .",
    "this allows us to discard any variability candidates for which the multiple dlcs do not show clearly correlated trends , both in amplitude and time .",
    "we define @xmath40 for a given dlc as the ratio of its standard deviation , @xmath41 , and the mean @xmath42 of its individual data points , @xmath43 .",
    "this value of @xmath44 for the @xmath45 dlc of the agn has the corresponding probability , @xmath46 , that the dlc is steady ( non - variable ) , assuming a normal distribution . for a given agn",
    "we then compute the joint probability , @xmath47 , by multiplying the values of @xmath46 s for individual dlcs available for the agn .",
    "the effective @xmath40 parameter , @xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath47 , is given in table 1 for each variable agn ; our definition of variability is @xmath49 , which corresponds to a confidence level in excess of 99% .",
    "this is followed by the variability amplitude , @xmath39 .",
    "we also note that for these agn all the dlcs between comparison stars were found to show statistically insignificant variability .",
    "to what extent can the observed inov of rqqs be reconciled with the much more pronounced inov of the bl lacs ? within the canonical jet picture , any flux variations associated with the relativistic outflow will have their time - scales shortened and amplitudes boosted in the observer s frame . as usual , the doppler factor is @xmath50^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , and @xmath53 is its viewing angle . then the observed flux , @xmath54 is given in terms of the intrinsic flux , @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 for a continuous jet ( e.g.  urry & padovani 1995 ) ; the spectral index @xmath58 , and we have assumed @xmath59 ( stocke et al .",
    "similarly , the beaming shortens the observed time scale to @xmath60 .",
    "the effect of doppler beaming on the observed dlcs is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , taking the example of the bl lac object ao 0235@xmath18164 , for which we found a large ( @xmath6113% ) and rapid ( @xmath62 @xmath0 3.5 hr ) variation on 1999 november 12 .",
    "we use the estimated @xmath63 = 8.1 for this object ( zhang , fan , & cheng 2002 ) to simulate the dlcs for lower values of @xmath64 , relevant to observers at larger viewing angles .",
    "this mapping is achieved simply by compressing the observed dlc amplitudes by @xmath65 and , simultaneously , stretching the dlc in time by a factor @xmath66 . from these simulated dlcs",
    "it is evident that observers even marginally misaligned from the jet direction will monitor a drastically reduced inov , both in amplitude and rapidity , for the same bl lac which appears highly variable to a somewhat better aligned observer ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for instance , if @xmath67 for the jet of ao 0235@xmath18164 , the estimated @xmath63 = 8.1 corresponds to @xmath68 = 0.978 .",
    "this would give @xmath69 4 and 2 , respectively , for modestly misaligned viewing angles of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , thought to be typical of rqqs ( antonucci 1993 ; barthel 1989 ) .",
    "we thus suggest that the mere low level of intranight optical variability of rqqs in no way rules out their having optical synchrotron jets as active intrinsically as the jets of bl lacs . the large difference in the radio properties could arise from inverse compton quenching of the jet in a majority of quasars , occurring beyond the very small physical scale probed by the nuclear optical synchrotron jet emission .",
    "a possible signature of such quenching is the hard x - ray spectral tail found in some rqqs ( george et al .",
    "this emission from the ( modestly misaligned ) jets is seen despite the extremely strong forward flux boosting of the x - rays expected from the inverse compton scattering of external ( e.g. , broad emission line ) photons by the relativistic jet ( @xmath72 , dermer 1995 ) .",
    "it remains possible that the weak fluctuations seen in rqqs arise from a different process , such as fluctuations from an accretion disk ( e.g.  mangalam & wiita 1993 ) , while the larger ones seen only in bl lacs might originate from jets .",
    "nonetheless , our observations and analysis lend some support to the concept of a jet - disk symbiosis ( e.g.  falcke , malkan & biermann 1995 ) where jets emerge ubiquitously from accretion flows ; hence , the dichotomy between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars need not imply a fundamental difference in their central engines .",
