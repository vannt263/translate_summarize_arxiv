    "stellar mass is emerging as one of the most important parameters in determining the properties of planetary systems , along with stellar metallicity .",
    "radial velocity surveys have indicated that the frequency of giant planets increases with the mass of the stellar host @xcite , and many of the roughly dozen exoplanets that have been directly imaged so far have had a - type stellar hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these results have motivated targeted imaging surveys for planets around massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the increase in planet frequency with host star mass can be readily explained theoretically , through the consideration that more massive stars are likely to have more massive disks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", massive stars also feature an increased intensity of high - energy radiation , which may significantly shorten the disk lifetime due to photoevaporation , and thus decrease the time window in which giant planets are allowed to form .",

    "we first detected @xmath2  and  b using ao188 coupled with hiciao on subaru telescope on january 1 , 2012 , as part of the seeds survey @xcite .",
    "the observations used a 20@xmath13 @xmath14 20@xmath13 field of view , 9.5mas pixels , and an opaque 06-diameter coronagraphic mask , which helped keep the saturation radius @xmath15 @xmath16 .",

    "given the relatively high s / n ratios and the known difficulties in quantifying the impact of loci on planet photometry and astrometry , we also performed a classical adi reduction @xcite with ` mean`-based point - spread function ( psf ) estimation and frame co - adding .",
    "unsharp masking on the spatial scale of 35 pixels ( @xmath22 7fwhm ) was applied to the final image to flatten the residual background .",

    "the resulting processed psf acted as the photometric and astrometric reference for @xmath2  and  b. the only non - linear step in this process was the ` median`-based unsharp masking , but the large spatial scale ( @xmath22 7fwhm ) ensured that subtraction effects were minimal .",
    "we calibrated the astrometry by cross - correlating the @xmath2  and  b signal with the processed calibration psf .",
    "we estimated the uncertainty in the @xmath2  and  b center to be @xmath25 , following @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the final relative astrometry were dominated by our ability to determine the host star center , which was carried out through moffat fitting of each individual exposure .",

    "we sky - subtracted each image using a median combination of frames taken at the other dither positions . to help maximize the high - contrast sensitivity , we processed the data using an `` adaptive '' loci process ( a - loci ; @xcite ) .",

    "we calculate the predicted @xmath3@xmath5@xmath6 magnitudes based on the estimated 1680  k temperature , the 2050 myr system age , and the ` dusty ` evolutionary models .",
    "this yields @xmath3 = 16.516.8 , @xmath5 = 14.214.4 , and @xmath6 = 13.113.2 mags , all of which are in agreement with our measured multiband photometry . additionally , the two epochs of @xmath4-band photometry are in agreement with one another .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] summarizes the complete properties of @xmath2  and  b.    while the dusty models are likely the more relevant , we estimate a possible alternative mass using the cond evolutionary tracks . in this scenario ,",
    "we determine a mass of 11.5@xmath36 @xmath11 and a temperature of 1640@xmath37k . more recent evolutionary models by @xcite offer alternative `` warm start '' scenarios that consider formation with lower levels of initial entropy .",
    "while these models do not consider combinations of mass and temperature similar to that of @xmath2  and  b , they do predict generally higher masses than that of the dusty and cond models . in the case of @xmath2  and",
    "b , such models place the most probable mass at a value above the typical deuterium burning limit .",
    "while we currently adopt a nominal mass estimate of 12.8@xmath34 @xmath11 for the analyses in this discovery paper ( based on the dusty models ) , we defer a deeper investigation of companion mass for a follow - up paper , where we will focus on a more thorough comparison of multiband photometry with synthetic spectra .",
    "we estimate the semimajor axis of @xmath2  and  b from its observed separation . assuming a uniform eccentricity distribution of 0 @xmath15 _ e _ @xmath15 1 , and random viewing angles , @xcite compute a median correction factor between projected separation and semimajor axis of 1.1@xmath38 . using this relation ,",

    "@xmath2  and is the most massive star to host a directly imaged planet , or brown dwarf near the deuterium burning boundary .",
    "the mass ratio between @xmath2  and  b and its host is @xmath70.5% , similar to the @xmath70.4% ratios of the @xmath41  pic and hr  8799 planets @xcite . in comparison , this value is noticeably smaller than those of reported directly imaged planets around 1rxs  1609 @xcite and 2 m  1207 @xcite .",
    "the projected separation of @xmath2  and  b is also intermediate between the two outer planets in hr  8799 .",
    "the similarities between @xmath2  and  b , @xmath41  pic , and hr  8799 could imply a similar formation mechanism , which may be distinct from recently discovered brown dwarf companions of approximately an order of magnitude larger mass ratios ( e.g. , gj  758  b ; * ? ? ? * ) or semimajor axes ( e.g. , hip  78530  b ; * ? ? ?",
    "strengthening the possibility of a planet - like formation for kap and b , theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that , for a minimum mass solar nebula , the region of the primordial disk where core accretion formation of giant planets can occur overlaps with the separation range of @xmath2  and  b. furthermore , this formation mechanism may be significantly enhanced for a star as massive as @xmath2  and , assuming it had a correspondingly more massive protoplanetary disk .",
    "further studies will be needed to more stringently constrain the population properties of planets and brown dwarfs on intermediate and wide orbits .",
    "the best - fit mass of @xmath2  and  b lies just below the deuterium burning limit according to conventional evolutionary models , but may be above this limit if initial entropy at formation is lower than such models assume @xcite .",
    "this leads to an ambiguity in whether the companion can be classified as an `` exoplanet '' by the present iau definition .",
    "such a classification scheme can however be misleading , given that @xmath2  and  b may well have formed in the same way as previously imaged planets , regardless of whether its mass falls just below or above this limit .",
    "indeed , radial velocity studies have shown that massive stars tend to have massive planets , sometimes with companions having masses above the deuterium burning limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and which apparently form a high - mass tail of a lower - mass planetary population ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand , formation history can be difficult to assess in individual cases . in order to avoid these uncertainties ,",
    "we simply classify @xmath2  and  b as a ` super - jupiter ' , which we take to mean a group of objects that includes the previously imaged planets around hr  8799 and @xmath41  pic as well as the most massive radial velocity planets , and which one might suspect have formed in a similar way to lower - mass exoplanets , but for which this has not necessarily been unambiguously demonstrated .",
    "this suggested class includes substellar objects with masses at or moderately above the deuterium burning limit , but excludes objects with orbital separations well beyond a typical disk truncation radius , or systems with mass ratios more indicative of a binary - like formation .",
