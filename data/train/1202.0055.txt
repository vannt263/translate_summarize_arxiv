    "the detection and parameter estimation of moving targets is one of the most important radar applications @xcite@xcite .",
    "the moving target parameters of interest can be the radar cross section ( rcs ) , doppler frequency , range / location , velocity , acceleration , etc . @xcite . in conventional single antenna radar , the target rcs and range",
    "are measured from the amplitude and the time delay of the return signal , respectively , while the target velocity is measured from the doppler frequency shift of the received signal @xcite .",
    "the use of antenna arrays enables improving the signal strength resulting in improving the accuracy of target parameter estimation .",
    "in particular , antenna arrays are used at the transmitter to form / steer a beam towards a certain direction in space yielding coherent processing gain and at the receiver to coherently process the received data .",
    "a corresponding radar system is commonly referred to as phased - array radar @xcite .",
    "however , it is well - known that phased - array radar suffers from rcs scintillations which are responsible for signal fading @xcite .",
    "therefore , a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) radar has recently become the focus of intensive research @xcite@xcite .",
    "the essence of the mimo radar concept is to employ multiple antennas for emitting several orthogonal waveforms and multiple antennas for receiving the echoes reflected by the target .",
    "mimo radar can be either equipped with widely separated antennas @xcite or colocated antennas @xcite .",
    "the latter type employs arrays of closely spaced transmit / receive antennas which results in increasing the virtual aperture of the receive array due to the fact that multiple independent waveforms are received by the same receive array .",
    "this enables improving angular resolution , increasing the upper limit on the number of detectable targets , and improving parameter identifiability at the price of losing the transmit coherent processing gain offered by the phased - array radar @xcite . on the other hand , a mimo radar systems with widely separated transmit",
    "/ receive antennas enable capturing the spatial diversity of the target s rcs @xcite . capitalizing on the spatial diversity of the target ,",
    "mimo radar offers a potential to prevent rcs scintillation and to combat signal fading .",
    "several techniques are reported in the literature for target detection and localization in coherent mimo radar systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however , the main focus of these techniques is to estimate the directions - of - arrival of targets located within a certain range - doppler bin .",
    "the problem of estimating the location and/or velocity of a moving target is investigated in @xcite , @xcite . however , in some practical applications the target may have variable speed which necessitates estimating not only the velocity but also the acceleration of the target . in this case , the target motion should be modeled as a second order polynomial . in other cases ,",
    "even higher order polynomials for modeling the target motion have to be considered .",
    "for example , acceleration and jerk ( rate of acceleration ) are used to model the motion of agile maneuvering targets as described in @xcite , @xcite . note that for a maneuvering target , the radial velocity with respect to any single receiver exhibits variation which causes significant spread of the radar echo in the doppler spectrum @xcite .",
    "other practical examples that exhibit variations in the target speed and , therefore , require high - order target motion modeling , include motion of highly maneuvering tactical ballistic missiles @xcite , landing of fighter jets on warship carriers @xcite , etc",
    ". unfortunately , the variation in the target s speed in the aforementioned applications limits the applicability of conventional techniques for target localization and parameter estimation .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a maximum likelihood ( ml ) based estimator for estimating the parameters of a moving target in multi - static non - coherent mimo radar systems .",
    "the radar motion within a certain processing interval is modeled as a general - order polynomial . in the specific case",
    "when the polynomial order is two , the polynomial coefficients correspond to the initial location , velocity , and acceleration of the target . by concentrating the ml function with respect to the nuisance parameters , e.g. , reflection coefficients ,",
    "we show that the ml problem can be interpreted in terms of the classic `` overdetermined '' nonlinear least - squares ( ls ) problem .",
    "the proposed ml estimator requires multi - dimensional search over the unknown parameters of interest , i.e. , the unknown polynomial coefficients of the target motion .",
    "simulation results demonstrate an excellent performance of the proposed estimator .",
    "it is worth noting that the superior performance of the proposed algorithm comes at price of the higher computational complexity mandated by the ml algorithm .",
    "therefore , the development of a computationally efficient algorithms that enable reducing the computational cost of solving the proposed parameter estimation problem is of interest .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the mimo radar signal model is given in section  ii while the proposed moving target motion model is given in section  iii .",
    "we derive the ml estimator in section  iv .",
    "the cramr - rao bound ( crb ) is derived in section  v. simulation results which show the effectiveness of the proposed ml estimator are reported in section  vi followed by conclusions drawn in section  vii and appendix where the details of crb derivations are presented .",
    "this paper is reproducible research @xcite and the software needed to generate the simulation results will be provided to the ieee xplore together with the paper upon its acceptance .",

    "that when the relative speed between the target and the radar platform is large , the fact that the spectrum of the clutter is centered around the platform velocity ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) enables the use of stap techniques to filter out the clutter .",

    "<S> the problem of estimating the parameters of a moving target in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) radar is considered and a new approach for estimating the moving target parameters by making use of the phase information associated with each transmit - receive path is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is required for this technique that different receive antennas have the same time reference , but no synchronization of initial phases of the receive antennas is needed and , therefore , the estimation process is non - coherent . </S>",
    "<S> we model the target motion within a certain processing interval as a polynomial of general order . </S>",
    "<S> the first three coefficients of such a polynomial correspond to the initial location , velocity , and acceleration of the target , respectively . a new maximum likelihood ( ml ) technique for estimating the target motion coefficients is developed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the considered ml problem can be interpreted as the classic `` overdetermined '' nonlinear least - squares problem . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed ml estimator requires multi - dimensional search over the unknown polynomial coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the cramr - rao bound ( crb ) for the proposed parameter estimation problem is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the proposed estimator is validated by simulation results and is shown to achieve the crb .    </S>",
