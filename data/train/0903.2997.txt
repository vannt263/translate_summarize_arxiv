    "epidemiology is a big subject with a long history and a large literature ; standard texts on modeling include  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , note also the new volume on numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "the spreading of an infectious disease involves a ( large ) population in which an initially small number of individuals are infected .",
    "each infected individual is for a period of latency @xmath0 not yet infectious but at the end of the latent period the individual becomes infectious for a period @xmath1 models provide distributions for the random variables @xmath0 and @xmath2 the rest of the population is susceptible to infection from infectious individuals ; this susceptibility is often taken to be a constant but later we shall consider a population with an evolving inhomogeneous distribution of susceptibilities to infection . an infectious individual has random infectious contacts at a rate @xmath3 and contact with a susceptible individual results in infection and then the latent period of that individual commences .",
    "the so - called basic reproduction number is @xmath4 the product of the rate of infectious contacts and the mean period of infectiousness @xmath5    @xcite discussed the sensitivity of dynamical properties of an epidemic model to the choices of formulation and made use of a gamma distribution for the period of infectiousness and allowed for optional seasonality .",
    "@xcite introduced a new approach to the analysis of epidemic time series data to take account of partial observation of latency and the temporal aggregation of observed data .",
    "they showed that homogeneous standard models can miss key features of epidemics in large populations .",
    "also , @xcite devised an estimate of reproduction number in terms of coarsely reported epidemic data , showing that an ideal reporting interval is the mean generation time rather than a fixed chronological interval .",
    "see also recent work by @xcite for related results on partially observed data and by @xcite on general distributions of generating intervals .",
    "@xcite have edited a new collection of articles on mathematical and statistical approaches to epidemic modelling and chapter 2 there , by g. chowell and f. bauer , gives a detailed study of the basic reproduction rate in a variety of epidemic models .",
    "@xcite addressed the sensitivity of the reproduction number to the shape of the distribution of generation intervals and obtained upper bounds even in the situation of no information on shape .",
    "recently  @xcite described a model where the period of latency @xmath0 and the period of infectiousness @xmath6 have independent gamma distributions .",
    "they found that variability in these random variables had opposite effects on the epidemic growth rate .",
    "that rate increased with greater variability in @xmath0 but decreased with greater variability in @xmath2 here we extend their result by using the mckay bivariate gamma distribution for the joint distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath7 recovering the above effects of variability but allowing in case it may be of relevance the possibility of correlation .",
    "one might imagine that in the case of a disease in which the physical changes during latency lead to longer future infectiousness if the period of their development is longer , then the random variables @xmath0 and @xmath6 may have a positive correlation .",
    "we use methods of stochastic rate processes to obtain explicit solutions for the growth of the epidemic and the evolution of the inhomogeneity and information entropy .",
    "this admits a closed analytic solution to the evolution of the distribution of the number of uninfected individuals as the epidemic proceeds , and a concomitant expression for the decay of entropy .",
    "the family of mckay bivariate gamma distributions has a tractable information geometry which provides a framework in which the evolution of distributions can be studied as the outbreak grows , with a natural distance structure for quantitative tracking of progress .",
    "in their discussion of epidemic modelling , @xcite highlighted aspects when stochastic features are more important than deterministic ones . in particular",
    ", they described the importance of admitting random variables to represent the period of latency @xmath0 and the period of infectiousness @xmath7 their standard susceptible - exposed - infectious - removed ( seir ) epidemic model was elaborated using independent gamma distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath6 with means @xmath8 and standard deviations @xmath9 the basic ( mean ) reproduction number is given by @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the rate of infectious contacts and @xmath11 is the mean length of infectious period .",
    "an epidemic becomes a major outbreak if @xmath12 and then the number infected increases exponentially , @xmath13 where the malthusian parameter @xmath14 satisfies the equation @xmath15 their independent bivariate model expresses @xmath16 in terms of the parameters of the two gamma distributions .",
    "they used means , @xmath8 and coefficients of variation @xmath17 to deduce @xmath18 then @xcite found from numerical analysis of ( [ rate ] ) that , at fixed @xmath19 the growth rate @xmath14 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath8 and @xmath20 but it is increasing with @xmath21 so increased variability in latency period increases the epidemic growth rate whereas increased variability in infectious period decreases the epidemic growth rate .",
    "the model described here adds to the work of @xcite in which they used _",
    "independent _ univariate gamma distributions for the periods of latency and infectiousness in an epidemic model that they illustrated with data from the sars outbreak  @xcite .",
    "they used numerical methods to obtain approximate solutions .",
    "our contribution is to use a bivariate gamma distribution which allows positive correlation between the random variables representing the periods of latency and infectiousness .",
    "that could represent a situation where physical changes during the latency period lead to longer future infectiousness if the period of their development is longer .",
    "we obtain a closed analytic solution and show that the same qualitative features persist in the presence of such correlation .",
    "this makes available the analytic information geometry of the space of probability densities , allowing comparison of possible trajectories for the epidemic against , for example , exponential distributions for periods of infectiousness or of latency , corresponding to underlying poisson processes .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it is rather difficult to devise bivariate versions of poisson , exponential distributions or more generally gamma distributions that have reasonably simple form , and indeed only freund bivariate exponential and mckay bivariate gamma distributions seem to have tractable information geometry  @xcite .",
    "the family of mckay bivariate gamma density functions   is defined on @xmath22 with parameters @xmath23 and probability density functions , figure  [ mckaypdf ] , @xmath24 here @xmath25 which must be positive , is the covariance of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the probability density for the two random variables @xmath26 and @xmath29 where @xmath26 and @xmath30 both have gamma density functions .",
    "( 300,150)(0,0 ) ( -50,-10 )    ( 300,170)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    we obtain the means , standard deviations and coefficients of variation by direct integration : @xmath31    the correlation coefficient , and marginal probability density functions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given by @xmath32 figure  [ mckayrhoa1a2 ] shows a plot of the correlation coefficient from equation ( [ rhoa1a2 ] ) .",
    "the marginal probability density functions of latency period @xmath26 and infectiousness period @xmath27 are gamma with shape parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "it is not possible to choose parameters such that both marginal functions are exponential , so the two random variables can not both arise from poisson processes in this model .",
    "for a detailed monograph on stochastic epidemic models see @xcite . we consider here a class of simple stochastic rate processes where a population @xmath35 of uninfected individuals , is classified by a smooth family of time - dependent probability density functions @xmath36 with random variable @xmath37 having at time @xmath38 mean @xmath39 and variance @xmath40 this situation",
    "was formulated by  @xcite ,  @xcite in the following way .",
    "let @xmath41 represent the frequency at the @xmath42-cohort , then we have @xmath43 general solutions for these equations were given in @xcite , from which we obtain @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the laplace transform of the initial probability density function @xmath46 and so conversely @xmath46 is the inverse laplace transform of the population ( monotonic ) decay solution @xmath47 see @xcite for more discussion of the existence and uniqueness properties of the correspondence between probability densities and their laplace transforms . in this section we shall use @xmath48 to represent the decreasing population of _ uninfected _ individuals as an epidemic grows . in our context of an epidemic model",
    "we might view the random variable @xmath42 as a feature representing susceptibility to infection in the population ; in general this distribution will evolve during the epidemic .",
    "the model can be reformulated for a vector @xmath49 representing a composite population with a vector of distributions @xmath50 and a matrix of variables @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "( 300,160)(0,0 ) ( -20,-20 )    ( 300,180)(0,0 ) ( 0,-20 )    it is easy to deduce the rate process for entropy from karev s model .",
    "the shannon entropy at time @xmath38 is @xmath52 which reduces to @xmath53 by using @xmath54 the decay rate is then @xmath55 this result shows how the variance controls the entropy change during quite general inhomogeneous population processes .",
    "in fact equation  ( [ sdecay ] ) and further related results were given also in subsequent papers  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "we note that the reverse process of population growth may have applications in constrained disordering type situations  @xcite .",
    "( 300,150)(0,0 ) ( 60,-10 )    ( 300,190)(0,0 ) ( 60,-10 )      we follow the method of @xcite in their  3.2 , to compute the initial exponential growth rate of the epidemic from equation ( [ malth ] ) which we write for bivariate @xmath56 in the form @xmath57 here , from  @xcite , @xmath58 for the average number of infections per infective , so @xmath3 is the contact rate ; this gives the malthusian parameter analytically in explicit form as @xmath59 thus , @xmath14 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath60 and @xmath61 but increasing with @xmath62 figure  [ r123 ] and figure  [ r3 ] plot typical values from the sars epidemic  @xcite as used by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ l123 ] and figure  [ l3 ] show corresponding contour plots of the infectivity rate @xmath63 so the bivariate gamma model reveals that the result of  @xcite for the dependence of growth rate on variability in the periods of latency and infectiousness in the independent case persists also in the presence of correlation between these two random variables",
    ". such a correlation may be relevant in particular applications , when physical changes evolve during the latent period and influence the length of the subsequent infectiousness period .",
    "we can estimate also the evolution of an inhomogeneous distribution of susceptibility @xmath64 as the population @xmath48 of uninfected individuals declines with time @xmath65 for example , the case when the initial distribution @xmath46 is a gamma distribution with parameters @xmath66 was solved in @xcite giving the result @xmath67 then the time dependences of mean , standard deviation and coefficient of variation are given by @xmath68 from ( [ sdecay ] ) , we can see that the _ rate _ of entropy decrease is greater for more variability in susceptibility .",
    "information geometry of the smooth family @xmath69 of mckay bivariate gamma probability density functions , which is of exponential type , has been studied in detail in  @xcite chapter 4 .",
    "this provides a riemannian metric on @xmath70 yielding a curved 3-manifold so the affine immersion is a 3-dimensional object in @xmath71 which we can only represent in @xmath72 through its 2-dimensional submanifolds .",
    "here we illustrate how the geometry may nevertheless be used to provide a natural distance structure on the space of the mckay distributions used in our epidemic model .",

    "the two graphics , figures  [ msqrtecvxrho ] and [ msqrtea1a2 ] , show how we can depict the parameters in the joint distribution of periods of latency and infectiousness as surfaces of distance , measured from the two reference cases for the evolution of the epidemic starting from poisson processes , respectively . on such surfaces could be represented data on the progress of epidemics under different intervention schemes , or simulations of such scenarios .",

    "@xcite highlighted aspects when stochastic features are important and used independent gamma random variables to represent inhomogeneity of latency and infectiousness periods . in this paper",
    "we have a bivariate inhomogeneous epidemic process , modeled by correlated gamma distributions and we can use similar methods to depict and quantify departures from exponential periods of latency and infectiousness .",
    "this shows that the result of  @xcite for the dependence of growth rate on variability in the periods of latency and infectiousness in the independent case persists also in the presence of correlation between the two random variables , figures  [ r123 ] and [ r3 ] .",
    "moreover , the information theoretic distance from the two reference scenarios of exponential distributions of periods latency and infectiousness , figures  [ msqrtecvxrho ] and [ msqrtea1a2 ] , provide natural quantitative representations for comparing different parametric data .",
    "@xcite used independent gamma distributions for periods of latency and infectiousness , from which the reproduction rate can be estimated , with applications for example to the sars outbreak  @xcite . here",
    "we have used a bivariate gamma distribution which allows a corresponding reproduction rate to be computed .",
    "also , we considered the case when the susceptibility to infection is not uniform and illustrated with the case when it begins as a gamma distribution then evolves as the epidemic proceeds .",
    "other models could be used for the initial distribution of susceptibilities , including asymmetric distributions .",
