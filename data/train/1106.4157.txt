    "for most turbulent flows in nature and technology , it is impossible to resolve all relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "systematic methods to derive models with a reduced number of degrees of freedom from the full set of nonlinear fluid equations are thus necessary .",
    "low - dimensional modeling of transient and turbulent flows using galerkin projection onto the empirical basis functions which are obtained from a proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) is one such well established method .",
    "@xcite pod and the development of galerkin models based on pod modes has been applied to a number of fundamental hydrodynamic flow problems , including simple wall - bounded shear flows , @xcite flows over cavities @xcite or in the wake of a cylinder.@xcite the development of low - dimensional models ( ldm ) based on pod modes has also been extended in several directions such as to the balanced pod method @xcite or to unsteady flow problems @xcite for which fast and slow flow modes are separated .",
    "most of these cases have been studied for laminar or transitional flows at lower or moderate reynolds numbers .    with increasing reynolds number",
    "the flows become turbulent , the number of degrees of freedom grows rapidly and their nonlinear couplings are increasingly relevant .",
    "the truncation of the set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ode ) which follows from galerkin projection introduces always a cut - off of these mode interactions and removes couplings between the degrees of freedom which are necessary for the transfer of kinetic energy from large to small scales .",
    "an additional dissipation mechanism has to be implemented in the low - dimensional model to account for the dominant dissipation by the truncated degrees of freedom .",
    "the particular way of truncation can then alter the dynamics in the ldm .",
    "several approaches to this problem have been suggested in the past .",
    "aubry @xcite used directly the energy transfer between resolved modes and unresolved modes at smaller scales to formulate a spectral closure in the truncated system of odes .",
    "moehlis @xcite presented streamwise - invariant truncations for a plane couette flow , and showed that very low - dimensional models with up to ten degrees of freedom can reproduce transient flow phenomena in low - reynolds - number shear flows .",
    "they also found that the detailed behavior of their ldm depends in a subtle manner on the modes included and that a proper account of the symmetries of the system is crucial .",
    "later smith @xcite included streamwise variations in their model .",
    "they also introduced a linear damping term , but only when the particular pod mode expansion coefficient @xmath1 is significantly anti - correlated with its time derivative , @xmath2 .",
    "cazemier @xcite constructed a ldm for driven cavity flows , consisting of the 80 most energetic pod modes computed from 700 snapshots of a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) . to study the time evolution of the truncated ode system , a slightly different linear damping term is introduced in their model .",
    "this term is calculated from the requirement that the energy of the ode system is conserved in a statistically stationary sense .    a few attempts to derive ldms",
    "are reported for rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection , despite being one of the most comprehensively studied flows.@xcite studies of rb convection in a finite box , based on the pod procedure , have been mostly done by sirovich and co - workers .",
    "@xcite sirovich and park @xcite discussed the importance of the discrete symmetries describing the velocity  temperature fluctuations field .",
    "deane and sirovich @xcite made a parametric study of the pod mode spectra for small rayleigh numbers @xmath3 .    only recently",
    ", a snapshot method has been applied to turbulent rb convection in a closed cylindrical cell for rayleigh numbers up to @xmath4 and cell aspect ratios between one half and three.@xcite in this work , emphasis was given to relating the first pod modes to the large - scale flow circulation which is always present in a closed turbulent convection cell .",
    "@xcite the disentanglement of the temperature and velocity fields into pod modes allowed the authors to quantify the amount of heat which is transported by the particular pod modes through the convection cell . a change of the large - scale flow from a one - roll to a two - roll pattern , which is observed when the aspect ratio is increased beyond one at a fixed rayleigh number , was in line with a decrease of transported heat by the primary mode compared to the secondary pod mode .",
    "as a correspondence of the few pod studies of rb convection , only a few works exist with an emphasis on developing a ldm by a galerkin projection of the boussinesq equations onto the most energetic pod modes .",
    "tarman @xcite derived a model from pod modes which have been however separately extracted from the velocity and temperature fields . in a second work he proposed an algorithm which incorporates the lost dissipation due to truncation.@xcite besides the cutoff index based on the energy ( mode index @xmath5 ) , a second index based on the dissipation ( @xmath6 ) was considered .",
    "the time dependence of the modes with indexes @xmath7 was expressed as the quotient of the corresponding nonlinear and dissipation coefficient .",
    "no closed forms for the constant coefficients in the ode system were however obtained in any of these works .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to extend these studies of rb convection in several directions .",
    "first , we construct a ldm for the evolution of the pod mode coefficients @xmath1 in the case of turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection in a cartesian cell with periodic side walls and isothermal free - slip top and bottom square planes .",
    "it is essential to use pod modes of the combined four - vector velocity - temperature field.@xcite in this derivation , it turns out that a cubic term due to the interaction of the velocity with the mean temperature field ( denoted as @xmath8 ) becomes linear as a consequence of the orthogonality of the pod modes .",
    "the other terms which arise in the galerkin projection are a linear production term @xmath9 , a linear dissipation term @xmath10 , a quadratic nonlinear term @xmath11 , and a constant term @xmath12 corresponding to the dissipation due to the mean temperature field .",
    "second , our studies will extend previous works @xcite in terms of the magnitude of the rayleigh number of convection .",
    "a case with @xmath13 is considered for which rb convection is turbulent and a dns data record exists .",
    "third , we are interested in the long - time behavior of the dynamics in the ldm . with a view to more complex",
    "convection flows in the future , we are seeking for the least set of pod modes that can reproduce characteristic dynamics of turbulent convection .    a solution which includes the additional dissipation due to the neglected less energetic pod modes has to be considered by an additional eddy viscosity ",
    "diffusivity , @xmath14 .",
    "first , we present the so  called heisenberg model with a constant @xmath15 which exerts the same fraction of dissipation on all pod modes . as will be shown , this closure requires at least a minimum number of degrees of freedom , in particular with respect to the vertical direction , for a qualitatively correct description of the flow . as a consequence , two ldms with 210 and 310 degrees of freedom ,",
    "respectively , are chosen .",
    "they are taken from a set of 15708 modes ( see sec .",
    "iii b ) . as will be seen",
    ", this model fails to reproduce the large - scale evolution of convection . for the larger of the two sets of modes",
    ", the model relaxes to a statistically stationary state which contains too much energy .",
    "second , we refine this model and include a mode  dependent ( or modal ) eddy viscosity  diffusivity . the magnitude of both eddy viscosity ",
    "diffusivity contributions has to be estimated . in order to do so",
    ", we will follow a procedure that has been suggested by cazemier @xcite .",
    "the second model yields much more realistic large - scale variations of the most energetic modes , also reproducing with reasonable accuracy the energy spectrum and the turbulence statistics .",
    "therefore , a significant part of the present work discusses the impact of both types of eddy viscosity - diffusivity @xmath15 on the dynamics of the ldm with different number of degrees of freedom and how it compares to dns .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the equations of motion , the basic idea of pod  in particular for the method of snapshots  is discussed in the next section .",
    "the construction of the ldm by galerkin projection onto pod modes of rb convection follows in sec .",
    "iii . in this section , the results of the time integration of the ldm with both eddy viscosity  diffusivity schemes , and the agreement with the dns are also discussed .",
    "we conclude with a summary and give an outlook .",

    "they are brought into a dimensionless form by rescaling with the domain height @xmath16 , the diffusive time scale @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the thermal diffusivity , the temperature difference @xmath19 and follow to @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the velocity field , @xmath24 the departure from the linear conduction temperature profile , and @xmath25 is the kinematic pressure .",

    "this regime can be considered as a fixed point which is however not in the focus of the present study .",
    "we showed also that the effect of @xmath15 on the dynamics of the largest - scale modes is to force them into a state with small fluctuations after the passage of a longer transient .",

    "the question is interesting and important in view to more complex situations , e.g. the problem of mixed convection in indoor ventilation systems .",
    "can the same pod framework ( with a mathematical foundation ) be carried over to more complex convection flows ?",
    "a big advantage of the present turbulent convection case in the cartesian box with periodic side walls is that we have 16 symmetries that significantly enhance the data base . in view of applications in more complex geometries",
    ", this indicates that a similar approach might be much more complicated and could enhance the limitations that showed up already for the present turbulent flow . nevertheless , since the questions , for example with the long - term behavior of the large - scale circulation in turbulent convection @xcite or indoor ventilation , are important , we believe that it is still interesting to further follow this route of ldm development based on the pod framework . some of these efforts will be hopefully presented in the near future .",
