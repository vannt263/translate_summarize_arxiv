    "the conway - radin pinwheel tiling @xcite , a variant of which is shown in figure  [ fig : pinw ] , is a substitution tiling with tiles occurring in infinitely many orientations .",
    "consequently , it is not of _ finite local complexity _ ( flc ) with respect to translations alone , though it is flc with respect to euclidean motions .",
    "this property distinguishes the pinwheel tiling from the majority of substitution tilings considered in the literature . as a consequence ,",
    "its diffraction differs considerably from that of other tilings , and despite a growing interest in such structures @xcite , the diffraction properties have only been partially understood to date .    whereas the pinwheel tiling is the most commonly investigated example ,",
    "there are other tilings with infinitely many orientations , compare @xcite for an entire family of generalisations .",
    "yet another example is shown in figure  [ fig : pinw9 ] .",
    "it has a single prototile , an equilateral triangle with side lengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath1 . under substitution ,",
    "the prototile is mapped to nine copies , some rotated by an angle @xmath2 , which is incommensurate to @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , the corresponding rotation @xmath5 is of infinite order , and the tiles occur in infinitely many orientations in the infinite tiling . here and below",
    ", @xmath6 denotes the rotation through the angle @xmath7 about the origin .",
    "more examples of tilings with tiles in infinitely many orientations can be found in @xcite .",
    "it was shown constructively in @xcite that the autocorrelation @xmath8 of the pinwheel tiling has full circular symmetry , a result that was implicit in previous work @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the diffraction measure @xmath9 of the pinwheel tiling shows full circular symmetry as well . to make this concrete",
    ", we now construct a delone set from the tiling .",
    "recall that a _ delone set _ @xmath10 in euclidean space is a point set which is uniformly discrete ( i.e. , there is @xmath11 such that each ball of radius @xmath12 contains at most one point of @xmath10 ) and relatively dense ( i.e. , there is @xmath13 such that each ball of radius @xmath14 contains at least one point of @xmath10 ) .",
    "let @xmath15 be the unique fixed point of the pinwheel substitution of figure  [ fig : pinw ] that contains the triangle with vertices @xmath16 .",
    "this fixed point @xmath15 is the same as the one considered in @xcite .",
    "we now define the set of _ control points _",
    "@xmath17 of @xmath15 to be the set of all points @xmath18 such that the triangle with vertices @xmath19 is in @xmath15 and @xmath20 is the edge of length one .",
    "this choice of control points is indicated in figure  [ fig : pinw ] ( left ) and is the same as in @xcite .",
    "recall that the natural autocorrelation measure of a delone set @xmath10 is defined as @xmath21 where the limit is taken in the vague topology and exists in all examples discussed below ; for details , see @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the dirac measure in @xmath23 , and @xmath24 the closed ball of radius @xmath14 centred at the origin .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath9 is then the diffraction measure of @xmath10 , whose nature is often the first property to be analysed . since @xmath9 is a translation bounded measure on @xmath25",
    ", it has a unique decomposition , relative to lebesgue measure , into three parts , @xmath26 where the pure point part @xmath27 is a countable sum of ( weighted ) dirac measures , @xmath28 is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure , and @xmath29 is supported on a set of lebesgue measure @xmath30 , but vanishes on single points .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the autocorrelation @xmath31 of the pinwheel control points @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a discrete subset of @xmath35 , @xmath36 denotes the normalised uniform distribution on the circle @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a positive number . note that @xmath39 . in particular , @xmath31 shows perfect circular symmetry , as does the diffraction measure @xmath40 .",
    "this settles the pure point part : since @xmath31 is a translation bounded measure , and the fourier transform of such a measure is also translation bounded , it follows from the circular symmetry that there are no bragg peaks except at @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , a standard argument @xcite gives @xmath41 because the density @xmath42 , i.e. , the average number of points of @xmath10 per unit area , is @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , in our setting , each triangle has unit area and carries precisely one control point .",
    "below , we give more detailed information about @xmath34 and @xmath38 , which is needed to shed some light on the nature of @xmath29 and @xmath43 .",
    "[ distset ] the pinwheel delone set @xmath10 as defined in figure  @xmath44 satisfies :    * @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "* @xmath47 . *",
    "the distance set @xmath48 is a subset of @xmath49 .    in plain words",
    ", @xmath10 is a uniformly discrete subset of a countable union of rotated square lattices , all elements of @xmath10 have rational coordinates , and , as a consequence , all squared distances between points in @xmath10 are rational numbers of the form @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 is supported on such a simple set is an interesting property of the pinwheel tiling .",
    "it is not clear whether a similar property , for a suitable choice of control points , can be expected for other examples , such as that of figure  [ fig : pinw9 ] .",
    "these results were obtained by means of an alternative substitution , the _ kite domino _ substitution shown in figure  [ fig : kitedom ] , which generates the same delone set @xmath10 .",
    "the kite domino substitution is equivalent to the pinwheel substitution in the sense that the corresponding tilings are _ mutually locally derivable _ ( mld ) in the sense of @xcite , i.e. , they can be obtained from each other by local replacement rules .",
    "moreover , the delone set @xmath10 is mld with both tilings .",
    "because of the strong linkage between the diffraction spectrum of a delone set @xmath10 and the dynamical spectrum of the associated dynamical system @xmath51 , we consider the _ hull _ of @xmath10 @xmath52 where completion is with respect to the local rubber topology ( lrt ) , see @xcite and references therein for details",
    ". roughly speaking , and restricted to the special case under consideration , this means that @xmath53 contains all translates of @xmath10 and all delone sets which are locally congruent to some translate of @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to proposition  [ distset ] , the kite domino substitution gives access also to the frequency of configurations in the tilings .",
    "the _ frequency _ of a finite set @xmath54 is defined as @xmath55 note that this definition is up to congruence of the finite sets , not up to translation ( which is not reasonable here ) .",
    "the _ frequency module _ of @xmath10 is the @xmath56-span of @xmath57 .",
    "the frequency module of @xmath10 is @xmath58 .",
    "it is the same for all elements of @xmath53 . in particular , all @xmath38 in are rational .    using the kite domino substitution , one can determine some frequencies of small distances exactly .",
    "these are given below , together with some other values ( marked by an asterisk ) where the frequencies are estimated by analysing large approximants of the pinwheel tiling .",

    "in fact , the frequency of pairs of points with distance @xmath60 in the table above was calculated this way",
    ". however , the computation of each single frequency requires a considerable amount of work , and a closed formula for all frequencies seems out of reach .",
    "the diffraction of a crystal which is supported on a point lattice in @xmath61 is obtained by the poisson summation formula for dirac combs @xcite .",
    "if @xmath62 is a lattice , the autocorrelation of the lattice dirac comb @xmath63 is @xmath64 , and the diffraction measure reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the dual lattice of @xmath62 .    a radial analogue of eq .",
    "is derived in @xcite .",
    "it is an analogue of the hardy - landau - voronoi formula @xcite in terms of tempered distributions .",
    "let us first explain this for the example of the square lattice @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the distance set of @xmath67 , and @xmath69 the _ shelling numbers _ of @xmath70 , see @xcite for details .",
    "then @xmath71 with @xmath36 as above .",
    "again , the sum is to be understood as a vague limit . the fact that @xmath70 is self - dual as a lattice ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) implies that the same distance set enters all three sums in . in the general case , with an arbitrary lattice @xmath62",
    ", one has to use the distance set of the dual lattice @xmath66 of @xmath62 , in analogy with .",
    "this gives the following result @xcite , valid in euclidean space of arbitrary dimension .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath62 be a lattice of full rank in @xmath61 , with dual lattice @xmath66 .",
    "if the sets of radii for non - empty shells are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with shelling numbers @xmath75 and @xmath76 defined analogously , the classical poisson summation formula has the radial analogue @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the uniform probability measure on the sphere of radius @xmath12 around the origin .",
    ".   also implies @xmath79 in the sense of tempered distributions .",
    "this equation is useful in numerical calculations of pinwheel diffraction spectra .",
    "let us return to the pinwheel pattern @xmath10 .",
    "in view of eq .   in connection with proposition  [ distset ] , the sum in eq .",
    "can be recast into a double sum , @xmath80 where the choice of the @xmath81 is not unique , but restricted by the condition @xmath82 . if the @xmath81 , for fixed @xmath83 , could be chosen to be ` lattice - like '  in the sense that they form a sequence of shelling numbers for some lattice",
    " we were in the position to apply eq .",
    "to each inner sum in eq .   individually . observing that @xmath84 this would give rise to terms of the form @xmath85 . due to the continuity of the fourier",
    "transform on the space of tempered distributions , this would imply the diffraction of the pinwheel tiling to be purely singular .",
    "however , things are not that simple in the case of the pinwheel tiling .",
    "in particular , the @xmath81 can not be chosen to be lattice - like , as a consequence of the delone nature of @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , it may still be possible to find coefficients @xmath86 , not necessarily positive , such that the autocorrelation of @xmath10 can be written as @xmath87 this general form permits continuous parts in the diffraction different from the ones arising from : there may be singular continuous parts apart from @xmath88 , and even absolutely continuous parts .",
    "in fact , numerical computations indicate @xcite the presence of an absolutely continuous part in the diffraction .",
    "independent of an affirmative answer of the open questions , there is a striking resemblance with the powder diffraction image of the square lattice .",
    "this is a consequence of proposition  [ distset ] .",
    "so let us close this article with a simplified approach to powder diffraction patterns , and a comparison of the two images .      instead of performing a diffraction experiment with a large single crystal ,",
    "it is often easier to use a probe that comprises many grains in  ideally  random and mutually uncorrelated orientations @xcite .",
    "this setting can be modelled mathematically as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 be a rotation of infinite order , i.e. , @xmath89 for all integer @xmath90 .",
    "it follows from weyl s lemma that @xmath91 is uniformly distributed on the unit circle @xmath92 for any @xmath93 . for simplicity , we require @xmath94 .",
    "then , for large @xmath95 , the set @xmath96 can serve as an idealised powder emerging from a two - dimensional crystal supported on @xmath70 .",
    "note that the prefactor @xmath97 appears because we idealise the arrangement of disoriented grains as an overlay of mutually rotated infinite copies of @xmath67 .",
    "it is not hard to show @xcite that the corresponding autocorrelation is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes lebesgue measure in @xmath25 .",
    "the limit of the bracketed term , as @xmath100 , shows perfect circular symmetry , and is a reasonable approximation of the powder autocorrelation .",
    "an application of theorem  [ thm1 ] or eq .",
    ", yields @xmath101 this shows that , for an ideal square lattice powder as above , one can expect a diffraction image that , beyond the central intensity , consists of concentric rings of radius @xmath102 with total intensity @xmath103 . in this simplified version , there is no absolutely continuous part , though this would be present in a more realistic model .    to compare the powder diffraction of @xmath67 with the pinwheel diffraction , we note that it is sufficient to display the radial structure .",
    "furthermore , we can not compare the central intensity , wherefore we suppress it in both cases .",
    "while eq .   gives a closed formula for the intensity of the rings in the powder diffraction , we currently only have a numerical approximation to the pinwheel diffraction , based on eq .   and",
    "a large patch , see @xcite for details .",
    "figure  [ fig : pinsq ] , which speaks for itself , shows striking similarities of the singular parts .",
    "it is thus plausible that further investigations in this direction might ultimately reveal the full nature of the pinwheel diffraction .",
