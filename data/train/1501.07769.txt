    "many processes can leave an imprint on the complicated structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) observed in the milky way and nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , variations in the gas density can be due to : an evolving population of gravitationally bound clouds ; expanding supernova remnant shells compressing the gas ; cooling and heating of the gas leading to phase transitions ; the turbulent and compressible nature of the flow .    during the last two decades",
    "compressible turbulence has been recognized as an important cause of the density structure of the ism in the milky way . both isothermal ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and multi - phase @xcite simulations of the ism produced lognormal volume density distributions .",
    "several authors noted that for a large enough volume and for a long enough simulation run , the physical processes causing the density fluctuations in the ism in a galactic disc can be regarded as random , independent , multiplicative events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , the pdf of log(density ) becomes gaussian and the density pdf lognormal , as long as the local mach number and the density are not correlated @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that lognormal column density distributions in molecular clouds are a generic statistical representation of the inhomogeneous distribution of gas density , whether the inhomogeneity is a result of turbulence , gravity or ambipolar diffusion .",
    "recent reviews which discuss density pdfs of molecular clouds and their connection to turbulence and star formation include @xcite and recent theoretical modelling can be found in @xcite .",
    "observational evidence to test the simulation results is slowly growing .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite obtained lognormal column density pdfs for the extinction through dust in molecular clouds in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "the latter authors discuss the relationship between the density pdfs and star formation .",
    "@xcite presented lognormal pdfs of 12co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensities for four dust clouds in the mw , and @xcite found lognormal pdfs of the 12co(1 - 0 ) brightness temperature and integrated intensities in m51 .",
    "also the pdf of the @xmath2  column densities in m33 is lognormal , but with a high - density tail @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the luminosity function of the @xmath1  column density in the large magellanic cloud is lognormal .",
    "@xcite found lognormal distributions of the emission measures , which are proportional to the integral of the electron density squared , in the wisconsin @xmath7  mapper survey @xcite perpendicular to the galactic plane at latitudes @xmath8 , and along the plane , with different parameters .",
    "the emission measures of the extinction - corrected @xmath7  emission from the galaxy m33 @xcite and the volume density of the dust - bearing gas near stars within @xmath9 from the sun @xcite have lognormal distributions .",
    "furthermore , @xcite obtained lognormal pdfs for the fuv background emission from the isrf , and @xcite plotted the volume density distribution of the @xmath10-line emitting gas in the mw , which is approximately lognormal .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that in the milky way the volume density distribution of the diffuse , ionized gas ( dig ) at @xmath11 , and of the diffuse atomic gas are close to lognormal .",
    "they also discussed differences in the pdf dispersion observed for the atomic gas at low and high latitudes , and of warm and cold gas . here",
    "we present the pdfs of ionized and neutral gas column densities in the nearby galaxies m31 and m51 , which are close to lognormal , and discuss their properties .",
    "unfortunately , we can not separate the variation in gas density due to turbulence from variations caused by e.g. supernova explosions , hii regions or gravitation . therefore , our pdfs capture all kinds of density structure along the lines of sight ( los ) , regardless of the origin . on the other hand , high - density structures represent only a small fraction of the volume of the radio beams at our spatial resolution of about 300 @xmath12 .",
    "we will interpret the properties of the observed pdfs in terms of an effective los , @xmath13 , which is the fraction of the total los occupied by turbulent cells and gas clouds .",
    "furthermore , purely for the sake of clarity in the text , we will refer only to clouds rather than to clouds or turbulent cells .",
    "in reality , we can not make a firm distinction .",

    "all maps were reduced to a common field of about @xmath28 covering most of m51 apart from the extended southern outer arm in @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite set @xmath207 in their simulations of molecular clouds .",
    "if this relationship also holds in less dense gas phases , a three times smaller @xmath205 would imply a @xmath208 times higher mean @xmath204 in m51 than in m31 . since @xmath204 affects the pdf dispersion more strongly than @xmath205 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the pdfs for m51 will be wider than those for m31 , in agreement with our observations .",
    "separate measurements of @xmath204 and @xmath205 will be necessary to see how large this effect is compared to other influences on the width of the pdf .",
    "the scale of the density fluctuations influences the dispersion of the pdf because an increase in the number of clouds seen by the radio beam leads to a decrease in the dispersion as extremes are averaged out @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : models ] we demonstrated that this effect may occur across the beam area as well as along the los . in section  [ subsec : beam ]",
    "we show that the angular resolution hardly influences the observed dispersion , and in section  [ subsec : los ] that the effective length of the los is the dominant factor in shaping the observed pdfs .      in section  [ sec :",
    "models ] we showed that the dispersion @xmath5 of the column density pdfs varies strongly under smoothing when the smoothing beamwidth is smaller than about @xmath187 clouds , but that once the beamwidth is larger than this the effect of further smoothing becomes negligible .",

    "the lines are weighted least - squares fits to the data points.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we investigated this point for the column densities of @xmath1  and @xmath2  of m31 . to this end",
    "we smoothed the @xmath1  and @xmath2  maps with gaussian functions to angular resolutions of 24arcsec @xmath21 36arcsec ( indicated by 30arcsec ) , 90arcsec and 180arcsec , and calculated the pdfs .",
    "including the pdfs at 45arcsec and the original resolution of 23arcsec of the @xmath2  map , the range spans a factor of 7.8 in scale .",

    "[ fig : m31:disp ] ) .",
    "hence , the dispersion of the gas pdfs for m31 is independent of smoothing scale between about @xmath211 and @xmath212 in the plane of m31 .    since the los through the disc of m31 is large ( on average @xmath213 for the @xmath1  disc ) ,",
    "[ fig : losbeam](b ) suggests that smoothing will not affect @xmath5 when the fwhm is wider than about 2 clouds .",
    "we can use this to make an estimate of the upper limit to the size of the clouds in m31 .",
    "the smallest of the smoothing scales we consider , @xmath211 , must contain at least @xmath214 clouds , giving an estimate for the upper limit of the size of the clouds of @xmath215 .    note",
    "that the linear resolution of the m51 observations is about @xmath99 , similar to that of the best resolved @xmath1  observations of m31 .",
    "therefore , the difference in dispersion of the pdfs of the gas surface densities for m31 and m51 can not be caused by a difference in angular resolution , provided the scales of the clouds are the same .      in the case of column density pdfs ,",
    "figure  [ fig : losbeam](a ) shows that at a fixed resolution the fitted @xmath5 will be smaller by about a factor of @xmath216 for a @xmath217-times longer los .",
    "in particular , we found that @xmath5 decreases with @xmath218 .",
    "we observe this effect in the pdfs of m31 and m51 in several ways .",
    "first , the pdfs of m31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m31 ] ) have a smaller dispersion than those of m51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m51 ] ) .",
    "the los through the strongly inclined galaxy m31 is typically about 4 times longer than the los through m51 that is nearly seen face - on , provided that the scale heights are similar . assuming that the cloud scales in the two galaxies are comparable , we then expect more clouds along the los through m31 than along the los through m51 , and hence smaller dispersions of the pdfs for m31 than for m51 .",
    "second , for both m31 and m51 the pdfs of @xmath2  are significantly wider than those of @xmath1 .",
    "since the molecular gas is more concentrated in the disc mid - plane than @xmath1  ( due to the larger gravitational forces ) and molecular clouds are generally denser and smaller than @xmath1  clouds , the los through molecular gas are shorter than through @xmath1  gas leading to a larger dispersion of the @xmath2  pdf than of the @xmath1  pdf . also the mach number of the @xmath2  gas is higher than of the @xmath1  gas ( because the temperature is much lower whereas the turbulent velocity is similar ) , causing a higher compression of the gas in the molecular clouds by turbulent shocks and larger dispersions of the cloud pdfs ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , this effect may be reduced if the los intersects many clouds , or if the beamwidth is larger than the typical cloud size : in this case the peak of the pdf may move to a higher density but the dispersion can be unchanged . which of these two effects is responsible for the observed difference in the pdf dispersions requires further study .",
    "third , the @xmath1  pdf for the inner region of m31 is slightly wider ( @xmath219 ) than that for the bright ring ( @xmath220 ) where the los is longer and goes through more clouds than in the inner region .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the higher value of @xmath51 in the ring. the same trend is visible in the @xmath2  pdfs ( see table  [ table : m31:volume ] ) .    furthermore , the dispersions of gas pdfs derived in numerical simulations of the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are usually larger than observed pdfs .",
    "@xcite attributed the difference to the higher densities used in the simulations compared to observed densities",
    ". however , the much smaller lines of sight available in simulations than in observations may be the main cause of the larger dispersions of pdfs derived from simulations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible to quantify the relationship between the dispersion of column density pdfs and los .",
    "because the scale height of the gas in m31 increases outwards , we can test this relationship using the pdfs of the average volume densities of the sub - regions at different radii given in table  [ table : m31:volume ] .     of the pdfs of mean gas volume densities in m31 , the milky way and m51 on line of sight @xmath3 ( in pc ) .",

    "we conclude that the length of the line of sight through the gas in m31 , the mw and m51 is the main influence on the width of the pdfs of average volume density .",
