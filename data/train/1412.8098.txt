    "quantum systems can exhibit non - classical correlation by a different way from quantum entanglement , which is well - known quantum discord ( qd ) .",
    "qd characterizes the minimal perturbation induced by single - party von neumann measurement @xcite .",
    "thus there exists non - entangled state with non - zero qd .",
    "recently qd has been shown as a resource to speed up the quantum information processing .",
    "for instance the determined quantum computation with one qubit @xcite and quantum metrology with noised states @xcite have been demonstrated the advantage over classical computation , in which the quantum entanglement is not involved .",
    "in addition there exists extensive interest for qd in other diverse contexts @xcite .",
    "however qd is difficult to determine analytically because of the optimization in the definition .",
    "there exist very few exact results , even for the two - qubit cases @xcite .",
    "( recently an exact evaluation of qd is proposed in ref @xcite .",
    "however it is pointed out in @xcite that this approach is not completely correct . ) in addition the computation of quantum discord is shown to be np - complete @xcite ; the running time of the computation of qd is increased exponentially with the dimension of hilbert space .",
    "thus one has to find an efficient way to calculate qd .",
    "recently geometric discord ( gd ) is introduced by daki and the coauthors , which is defined as the square form of the shortest distance between the measured state @xmath0 and zero - discord state @xmath1 in hilbert space @xcite .",
    "hence the optimization in the definition of geometric discord ( gd ) can be reduced greatly by the geometry of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover a tight lower bound of gd can also been obtained for arbitrary states @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the square form of gd is not monotonic under local operations ; the value of gd can increase by local operations @xcite .",
    "this deficit raises the question whether gd or qd could unambiguously manifest the non - classical correlation in quantum systmes @xcite . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "many generalizations of gd have been proposed .",
    "for instance the rescaled gd is defined by rescaling the density operator with its norm @xcite .",
    "furthermore the so - called schatten @xmath2-norm is also introduced to qualify the distance @xcite , instead of the @xmath3-norm form used in ref .",
    "in addition the bures distance is also introduced @xcite .",
    "however it is still difficult generally to find the analytical expression for gd since the comple evaluation or optimization .",
    "recently the hellinger distance is introduced to measure qd @xcite .",
    "this definition has a simple structure and can be evaluated readily .",
    "moreover it is monotonically nonincreasing ( contractivity ) under local operations @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting issue how to generalize qd into multipartite case .",
    "a direct way is to introduce the three - tangle of qd in tripartite case @xcite and four - qubit case @xcite .",
    "however it still is difficult to determine analytically and furthermore to generalize into the case with more parties .",
    "another alternative way is to find the minimum qd between any single party and the others @xcite , named as the global qd .",
    "however it does not include the other possible bipartite correlation and thus is not a comprehensive measurement of qd .",
    "moreover the exact treatment of global qd is also difficult since one has to find optimal single - party von neumann measurements for every party . a geometric generalization of global qd",
    "is introduced by finding the shortest distance from the zero global qd state @xcite .",
    "however the author adopt the @xmath3-norm of distance , which suffers from the problem of non - contractivity under local operations @xcite .",
    "with respect of these facts , we present an alternative approaching to qd in this article by a generalization of hellinger distance @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to find the shortest distance from the completely classical state @xcite .",
    "hence this approach is independent on the local measurements .",
    "it should be pointed out that our way is a multipartite generalization of the method in ref .",
    "@xcite , with consideration of the recently arising critiques about qd @xcite . by this way the exact evaluation can be reached for any bipartite pure state and also for some special mixed states . as for multipartite case the exact results can also be founded for symmetric states .",
    "this article is divided into several sections .",
    "the definition is presented in section ii , and a general expression is also presented .",

    "<S> furthermore the generalization into multipartite case is direct . it is shown that it can be evaluated exactly when the measured state is invariant under permutation or translation . </S>",
