    "note that based on photometry of the stellar populations in the environment of sn 1979c ( from _ hst _ images ) , the progenitor of the sn was at most 10 million years years old , so its initial mass was probably 1718  @xmath14 @xcite .    during the past decade , there has been the gradual emergence of a new , distinct subclass of sne  ii @xcite whose ejecta are believed to be _ strongly _ interacting with dense circumstellar gas , even at early times ( unlike sne  ii - l ) .",

    "some of them are unusually luminous at maximum brightness , and they generally fade quite slowly , at least at early times . the equivalent width of the intermediate h@xmath0 component can grow to astoundingly high values at late times . the great diversity in the observed characteristics of sne  iin provides clues to the various degrees and forms of mass loss late in the lives of massive stars .",

    "its progenitor was a very luminous star , visible in many photographs of the host galaxy ( ngc 1058 ) prior to the explosion .",

    "many months after maximum brightness , its spectrum was essentially that of a sn  ib .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that sn 1987k had a meager hydrogen atmosphere at the time it exploded ; it would naturally masquerade as a sn  ii for a while , and as the expanding ejecta thinned out the spectrum would become dominated by emission from deeper and denser layers .",

    "fortunately , the type ii sn 1993j in ngc 3031 ( m81 ) came to the rescue , and was studied in greater detail than any supernova since sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "its light curves @xcite and spectra @xcite amply supported the hypothesis that the progenitor of sn 1993j probably had a low - mass ( 0.10.6  @xmath14 ) hydrogen envelope above a @xmath27 he core @xcite .",
    "figure 7 shows several early - time spectra of sn 1993j , showing the emergence of he  i features typical of sne  ib .",
    "considerably later ( figure 8) , the h@xmath0 emission nearly disappeared , and the spectral resemblance to sne  ib was strong .",
    "the general consensus is that its initial mass was @xmath28 .",
    "a star of such low mass can not shed nearly its entire hydrogen envelope without the assistance of a companion star .",
    "thus , the progenitor of sn 1993j probably lost most of its hydrogen through mass transfer to a bound companion 320  au away .",
    "in addition , part of the gas may have been lost from the system . had the progenitor lost essentially _ all _ of its hydrogen prior to exploding , it would have had the optical characteristics of sne  ib .",
    "there is now little doubt that most sne  ib , and probably sne  ic as well , result from core collapse in stripped , massive stars , rather than from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs .",
    "sn 1993j held several more surprises .",
    "observations at radio @xcite and x - ray @xcite wavelengths revealed that the ejecta are interacting with relatively dense circumstellar material @xcite , probably ejected from the system during the course of its pre - sn evolution .",
    "optical evidence for this interaction also began emerging at @xmath29 months : the h@xmath0 emission line grew in relative prominence , and by @xmath30 months it had become the dominant line in the spectrum @xcite , consistent with models @xcite .",
    "its profile was very broad ( fwhm @xmath23 17,000 km s@xmath21 ; figure 8) and had a relatively flat top , but with prominent peaks and valleys whose likely origin is rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the cool , dense shell of gas behind the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "radio vlbi measurements show that the ejecta are circularly symmetric , but with significant emission asymmetries @xcite , possibly consistent with the asymmetric h@xmath0 profile seen in some of the spectra @xcite .",

    "the data consist of one epoch of spectropolarimetry ( 5 days after discovery ) and total flux spectra spanning the first 494 days after discovery .",
    "the sn is found to exhibit a high degree of linear polarization ( figure 9 ) , implying significant asphericity for its continuum - scattering environment .",
    "prior to removal of the interstellar polarization , the polarization spectrum is characterized by a flat continuum ( at @xmath36 ) with distinct changes in polarization associated with both the broad ( symmetric , half width near - zero intensity @xmath37 km s@xmath21 ) and narrow ( unresolved , fwhm @xmath38 km s@xmath21 ) line emission seen in the total flux spectrum . when analyzed in terms of a polarized continuum with unpolarized broad - line recombination emission , however , an intrinsic continuum polarization of @xmath39 results , suggesting a global asphericity of @xmath40 from the oblate , electron - scattering dominated models of hflich @xcite .",
    "the smooth , blue continuum evident at early times is inconsistent with a reddened , single - temperature blackbody , instead having a color temperature that increases with decreasing wavelength .",

    "the type iin sn 1997eg also exhibits considerable polarization @xcite ; there are sharp polarization changes across its strong , multi - component emission lines , suggesting distinct scattering origins for the different components . based on our rather small sample",
    ", it appears as though sne  ii - p are considerably less polarized than sne  iin , at least within the first month or two after the explosion .",
    "leonard et al .",
    "@xcite show some spectropolarimetric evidence of asphericity in the ejecta of sn ii - p 1997ds , but it does not match the degree of polarization of sne  iin 1998s and 1997eg .",
    "moreover , sn ii - p 1999em does not reveal significant polarization variation across the strong balmer lines shortly after its explosion @xcite .",
    "at least a small fraction of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may be associated with nearby sne .",
    "probably the most compelling example thus far is that of sn 1998bw and grb 980425 @xcite , which were temporally and spatially coincident .",
    "sn 1998bw was , in many ways , an extraordinary sn ; it was very luminous at optical and radio wavelengths , and it showed evidence for relativistic outflow .",
    "its bizarre optical spectrum is often classified as that of a sn  ic , but the object should be called a  peculiar sn  ic \" if not a subclass of its own ; the spectrum was distinctly different from that of a normal sn  ic .",
    "as discussed by several speakers at this meeting , models suggest that sne associated with grbs are highly asymmetric .",
    "thus , spectropolarimetry should provide some useful tests .",
    "in particular , perhaps objects such as sn 1998s , discussed above , would have been seen as grbs had their rotation axis been pointed in our direction .",
    "that of sn 1998s was almost certainly _ not _ aligned with us @xcite ; both the spectropolarimetry and the appearance of double - peaked h@xmath0 emission suggest an inclined view , rather than pole - on .",
    "_ figure 10 : _ spectral evolution of sn 1999e , which may have been associated with grb 980910 .",
    "the case of grb 970514 and the very luminous sn iin 1997cy is also interesting @xcite ; there is a reasonable possibility that the two objects were associated .",
    "the optical spectrum of sn 1997cy was highly unusual , and bore some resemblance to that of sn 1998bw , though there were some differences as well .",
    "sn 1999e , which might be linked with grb 980910 but with large uncertainties @xcite , also had an optical spectrum similar to that of sn 1997cy @xcite ; see figure 10 .",
    "the undulations are very broad , indicating high ejection velocities . besides h@xmath0 , secure line identifications are difficult , though some of the emission features seem to be associated with oxygen and calcium .",
    "perhaps sn 1999e was produced by the highly asymmetric collapse of a carbon - oxygen core .    shortly before this meeting , sn  iin",
    "1999eb was discovered with kait @xcite , and terlevich et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that it might be associated with grb 991002 .",
    "however , kait data show that the optical sn was visible at least 10 days _ before _ the grb occurred , making it very unlikely that the two were linked .",
    "if sn 1999eb ends up showing double - peaked h@xmath0 emission at late times , as did sn 1998s , it will be another argument against the sn / grb association in this particular case , since our view will not have been pole - on .",
    "despite _ not _ being anything like  standard candles , \" sne  ii - p ( and some sne  ii - l ) are very good distance indicators .",
    "they are , in fact ,  custom yardsticks \" when calibrated with the  expanding photosphere method \" ( epm ) ; see @xcite .",
    "a variant of the famous baade - wesselink method for determining the distances of pulsating variable stars , this technique relies on an accurate measurement of the photosphere s effective temperature and velocity during the plateau phase of sne  ii - p .    briefly , here is how epm works .",
    "the radius ( @xmath42 ) of the photosphere can be determined from its velocity ( @xmath43 ) and time since explosion ( @xmath44 ) if the ejecta are freely expanding : @xmath45 , where we have assumed that the initial radius of the star ( @xmath46 at @xmath47 ) is negligible relative to @xmath42 after a few days .",
    "the velocity of the photosphere is determined from measurements of the wavelengths of the absorption minima in p - cygni profiles of weak lines such as those of fe  ii or , better yet , sc  ii .",
    "( the absorption minima of strong lines like h@xmath0 form far above the photosphere . ) the angular size ( @xmath48 ) of the photosphere , on the other hand , is found from the measured , dereddened flux density ( @xmath49 ) at a given frequency .",
    "we have @xmath50 , so    @xmath51^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the distance to the supernova , @xmath53 is the value of the planck function at color temperature @xmath54 ( derived from broadband measurements of the supernova s brightness in at least two passbands ) , and @xmath55 is the flux dilution correction factor ( basically a measure of how much the spectrum deviates from that of a blackbody , due primarily to the electron - scattering opacity ) .",
    "the above two equations imply that @xmath56 thus , for a series of measurements of @xmath48 and @xmath43 at various times @xmath2 , a plot of @xmath57 versus @xmath2 should yield a straight line of slope @xmath52 and intercept @xmath58 .",
    "this determination of the distance is independent of the various uncertain rungs in the cosmological distance ladder ; it does not even depend on the calibration of the cepheids .",
    "it is equally valid for nearby and distant sne  ii - p .",
    "an important check of epm is that the derived distance be _ constant _ while the sn is on the plateau ( before it has started to enter the nebular phase ) .",
    "this has been verified with sn 1987a @xcite and a number of other sne  ii - p @xcite . moreover",
    ", the epm distance to sn 1987a agrees with that determined geometrically through measurements of the brightening and fading of emission lines from the inner circumstellar ring @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that epm is relatively insensitive to reddening : an underestimate of the reddening leads to an underestimate of the color temperature @xmath54 [ and hence of @xmath53 as well ] , but this is compensated by an underestimate of @xmath49 , yielding a nearly unchanged value of @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , for errors in @xmath59 [ the visual extinction , or @xmath60 of 01 mag , one incurs an error in @xmath52 of only @xmath6120% @xcite .    of course , epm has some caveats or potential limitations .",
    "a critical assumption is spherical symmetry for the expanding ejecta , yet polarimetry shows that sn 1987a was not spherical @xcite , as do direct _ hst",
    "_ measurements of the shape of the ejecta .",
    "as discussed above , the few other sne  ii - p that have been studied do nt show very much polarization , though it is possible that deviations from spherical symmetry could be a severe problem for some sne  ii - p . on the other hand , the _ average _ distance derived with epm for many sne",
    "ii - p might be almost unaffected , given random orientations to the line of sight .",
    "( sometimes the cross - sectional area will be too large , and other times too small , relative to spherical ejecta . ) indeed , comparison of epm and cepheid distances to the same galaxies shows agreement to within the expected uncertainties for a sample of 6 objects ( @xmath62 ; @xcite ) .",
    "another limitation of epm is that one needs a well - observed sn  ii - p in a given galaxy in order to measure its distance ; thus , the technique is most useful for aggregate studies of galaxies , rather than for distances of specific galaxies in a random sample .",
    "finally , knowledge of the flux dilution correction factor , @xmath55 , is critical to the success of epm .",
    "fortunately , an extensive grid of models @xcite shows that the value of @xmath55 is mainly a function of @xmath54 during the plateau phase of sne  ii - p ; it is relatively insensitive to other variables such as helium abundance , metallicity , density structure , and expansion rate .",
    "also , it does not differ too greatly from unity during the plateau .",
    "there are , however , some differences of opinion regarding the treatment of radiative transfer and thermalization in expanding supernova atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the calculations are difficult and various assumptions are made , possibly leading to significant systematic errors .",
    "the most distant sn  ii - p to which epm has successfully been applied is sn 1992am at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the derived distance is @xmath64 mpc .",
    "this object , together with 15 other sne  ii - p at smaller redshifts , yields a best fit value of @xmath65 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , where the quoted uncertainty is purely statistical @xcite . a systematic uncertainty of @xmath66 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21",
    "should also be associated with the above result .",
    "the main source of statistical uncertainty is the relatively small number of sne  ii - p in the epm sample , and the low redshift of most of the objects ( whose radial velocities are substantially affected by peculiar motions ) .",
