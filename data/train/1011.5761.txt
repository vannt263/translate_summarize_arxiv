    "quantum graphs became object of intense interest in the last two decades , in part because of numerous possible applications especially in solid - state physics , and also as a tool to study various properties of quantum dynamics .",
    "the corresponding bibliography is huge , we limit ourselves to mentioning the proceedings volume @xcite , in particular the paper @xcite there , as a guide to further reading .",
    "an often studied class of graphs are those consisting of a finite internal part to which some number of semiinfinite leads is attached .",
    "such graph typically exhibit a family of resonances ; for the purpose of this letter the term _ resonance _ means both true resonances corresponding to pole singularities in the open lower complex halfplane of energy as well as eigenvalues of the graph hamiltonian embedded in the continuous spectrum . a question which attracted attention recently concerns the resonance behaviour at high energies . for most graphs of the described class the leading term coefficient in this asymptotics",
    "is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the sum of lengths of all internal edges , or `` volume '' of the internal part .",
    "this is the usual weyl law . ] and we will therefore refer to this case as _",
    "weyl_.    in a surprising observation , however , davies and pushnitski @xcite demonstrated that there are situations when this not true and a quantum graph has fewer resonances than the weyl law would predict , in other words , the relevant `` size '' of the graph entering the leading term of the asymptotics is smaller ; we will refer to them as _ non - weyl _ in the following .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this happens if the the coupling at the graph vertices is the so - called kirchhoff one , and at least one vertex is _ balanced _ joining the same number of internal and external edges . in the subsequent paper @xcite",
    "the claim was extended to graphs with general vertex couplings and a mechanism responsible for `` deleting '' of a part of the internal edges was explained .",
    "the question we address ourselves in the present letter is whether and how the high - energy resonance asymptotics can be changed if the graph is placed into a magnetic field .",
    "the exact profile of the field is not important .",
    "since the particle is confined to the graph and behaves locally as a one - dimensional one it is only influenced by the component of the vector potential tangent to the graph edge .",
    "moreover , as we will show in the next section , it is only the fluxes through all closed loops of the graph which are relevant for the resonance behaviour .",
    "in this section we recall a few basic notions about metric graphs and magnetic schrdinger operators on them .",
    "let @xmath2 be a metric graph consisting of set of vertices @xmath3 and set of edges @xmath4 containing @xmath5 finite edges and @xmath6 infinite leads .",
    "we equip it with a second order differential operator @xmath7 acting as @xmath8 at the infinite leads and as @xmath9 at the internal edges . here",
    "@xmath10 is the tangent component of the vector potential corresponding to the magnetic field ; without loss of generality we may assume that it is zero on external leads because on a edge which is not a part of a loop we can easily remove the vector potential by a gauge transformation .",
    "the domain of the indicated hamiltonian are functions in @xmath11 which satisfy the coupling conditions @xmath12 at the vertex @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding vectors of functional values and derivatives , respectively , and @xmath16 is the diagonal matrix whose entries are limit values of the magnetic potential at the vertex for each internal edge entering the vertex @xmath13  at the beginning of the edge with positive sign , at its end with negative one  and zero for terms corresponding to the halfline leads .",
    "writing the coupling condition for each vertex of @xmath2 separately may not be practical for some purpose , especially if the internal part consists of a larger number of edges .",
    "a useful alternative @xcite is to describe the coupling on the whole graph using a single block diagonal @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 by the condition @xmath19 one may think of a `` flower - like '' graph with all the vertices joined together .",
    "the topological structure of the original graph @xmath2 is now encoded in the block structure of the matrix @xmath18 consisting of the blocks @xmath20 . in a similar way , the vectors @xmath21 , @xmath22 and",
    "the matrix matrix @xmath23 are constructed from @xmath14 s , @xmath15 s and @xmath16 s , respectively .",
    "the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian constructed in the described way was proved ( with a slightly different notation ) in thm .",
    "2.1 of @xcite .    using the local gauge transformation @xmath24 with @xmath25 one can get rid of the explicit dependence of coupling conditions on the magnetic field and arrive thus at the free hamiltonian with the coupling conditions given by a transformed unitary matrix , @xmath26 with @xmath27 containing magnetic fluxes @xmath28 .",
    "treatment of graphs with external leads can be reduced to analysis of the internal part only . the way to do that is to introduce the effective energy - dependent coupling matrix @xmath29^{-1 } u_3\\ , ,    \\label{effective}\\ ] ] on the compact part of the graph obtained from @xmath2 by `` chopping off '' the leads @xcite . in the defining relation ,",
    "the matrices @xmath30 are the blocks of the original coupling matrix @xmath31 , where the @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 corresponds to the coupling between the internal edges , the @xmath34 matrix @xmath35 describes the coupling between the external edges and the rectangular matrices @xmath36 , @xmath37 couple the two groups of edges . for a magnetic graph with the coupling ( [ coupl2 ] ) the matrix @xmath38",
    "can be similarly replaced by the effective coupling matrix @xmath39 on the compact part of the graph defined in the analogous way .",
    "the main object of our interest here is the resonance count at high energies , that is , the number of resonances in a circle of radius @xmath40 in the momentum plane centred at the origin , @xmath41 .",
    "according to @xcite this quantity has the following behaviour @xmath42 as @xmath43 ; the effective graph size @xmath44 is bound from above by @xmath1 , the sum of lengths of all the internal edges . if those two quantities coincide , @xmath45 , the resonances follows the _ weyl asymptotics _ , otherwise we have a _ non - weyl _ situation . a criterion expressed in terms of the effective coupling matrix",
    "was derived in @xcite which allows us to tell when each of the two situations occurs .",
    "[ thm - del ] the graph has a non - weyl asymptotics iff at least one eigenvalue of @xmath46 is @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "let us now pass to our main topic . first we observe that under unitary transformations which do not mix the internal and external edges the distinction the non - weyl asymptotics character is preserved .",
    "[ noswitch ] let @xmath2 be a quantum graph with @xmath5 internal and @xmath6 external edges which are coupled by the condition ( [ coupl2 ] ) with a @xmath17 unitary matrix @xmath18 .",
    "let further @xmath49 be a quantum graph obtained from @xmath2 by replacing the coupling matrix @xmath18 by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is unitary block - diagonal matrix consisting of a @xmath52 block @xmath53 and an @xmath34 block @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath49 has a non - weyl resonance asymptotics iff @xmath2 does .",
    "let the matrix @xmath18 consist of the blocks @xmath33 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 in the way described above .",
    "then the coupling matrix of the transformed graph @xmath49 consists respectively of the blocks @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath59^{-1 } v_2^{-1 } u_3 v_1 = v_1^{-1 } \\tilde u(k ) v_1 $ ] as the effective energy - dependent coupling matrix for @xmath49 , and it has the same eigenvalues as @xmath46 .",
    "hence , according to theorem  [ thm - del ] the character of the asymptotics does not change .    using the fact that the coupling - matrix transformation @xmath60 defined by belongs to the class covered by theorem [ noswitch ] we arrive at the following conclusion .",
    "let @xmath2 be a quantum graph with weyl resonance asymptotics .",
    "then @xmath61 has also the weyl asymptotics for any profile of the magnetic field .",
    "in other words , the magnetic field alone can not switch a graph with non - weyl asymptotics into one with weyl asymptotics and _ vice versa_. on the other hand , as following example shows , the magnetic field _ can _ change the effective size of a non - weyl graph .        consider a graph consisting of one vertex connecting a loop of length @xmath62 and two halflines , with kirchhoff coupling conditions at the vertex  cf .",
    "[ fig1 ]  and place it into a magnetic field with constant value of tangent component of the potential . according to @xcite this graph has a non - weyl asymptotics in the non - magnetic regime .",
    "the resonance condition can be easily computed , e.g. , by the method of external complex scaling @xcite . using the ansatz @xmath63 for the wavefunction on the loop one obtains the set of equations @xmath64=",
    "0\\,,\\\\ a+b = \\mathrm{e}^{-ial}(a \\mathrm{e}^{ikl}+ b \\mathrm{e}^{-ikl } ) = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\theta/2 } g_\\theta ( 0)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 denotes the scaled function on the halfline .",
    "this leads to the resonance condition @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for the magnetic flux through the loop .",
    "one can see that for @xmath68 , that is , for odd multiples of a quarter of the flux quantum @xmath69 , the @xmath62-independent term disappears . by the results of @xcite",
    "the effective size of the graph is then zero , i.e. there are finitely many resonances ; it is straightforward to see that in the present case there are no resonances at all .",
    "the effective - coupling matrix is in this case equal to @xmath70 we notice that the resonances are absent when the sum of the off - diagonal elements vanishes .",
    "the last observation can be generalized to any one - loop quantum graph , with or without a magnetic field .",
    "the effective size of a graph with a single internal edge is zero iff it is non - weyl and its effective coupling matrix @xmath46 satisfies @xmath71 .    according to @xcite the resonance condition is @xmath72 where @xmath73\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\-i&1\\end{pmatrix}\\mathrm{e}^{ikl}+ \\right.\\\\ \\left .",
    "\\frac{1}{2}[(\\tilde u - i)-k(\\tilde u + i)]\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\i&1\\end{pmatrix}\\mathrm{e}^{-ikl } + k(\\tilde u+i)\\begin{pmatrix}i&0\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}+(\\tilde u -i)\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\right\\}\\ , ;   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for the sake of brevity we dropped here the argument of @xmath74 .",
    "since the graph is supposed to be non - weyl , the term with @xmath75 in the determinant vanishes , which means that @xmath74 has an eigenvalue equal to @xmath48 . to obtain a graph with zero effective size one needs to cancel also the term without the exponentials for which the combination of first two terms in the last displayed equation , @xmath76 and the last two ones , @xmath77 = 2ik \\tilde u_{21}\\,,\\ ] ] are relevant , hence a necessary and sufficient condition for finiteness of the resonance family is @xmath71 .",
    "this leads us directly to the following conclusion .    for any non - weyl quantum graph with one internal edge and @xmath78",
    "there is a magnetic field such that the graph under its influence has at most finite number of resonances .    under the unitary transformation ( [ coupl2 ] ) the effective coupling matrix changes to @xmath79 .",
    "adjusting the phase shift determined by the magnetic flux through the loop one can satisfy the condition of the previous proposition and ensure thus that the effective size of the corresponding magnetic graph is zero .",
