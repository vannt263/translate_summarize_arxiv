    "extracting information from the riemann curvature tensor of a metric field on a manifold is not an easy task due to its complicated algebraic structure .",
    "the problem can be handled when restricting to the algebraic invariants of the riemann tensor , for which the problem of giving all of them in terms of a basis has been recently solved , after decades of continued work @xcite . however ,",
    "this is frequently not enough and the differential invariants of riemann are then required .",
    "for example , bonnor @xcite has shown that the acceleration in the ` photon rocket ' metric does not affect the algebraic riemann invariants , but changes the differential invariants . in this way it is possible to introduce singularities in the curvature which are unnoticed by the algebraic curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "differential invariants of riemann are also required to compute the different loop - orders of renormalization of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xcite , or in dealing with its generalizations , like the lagrangian @xmath3 proposed in @xcite , or the general diffeomorphism invariant lagrangian @xmath4 analyzed in @xcite .    in spite of the large amount of effort dedicated to the algebraic invariants ,",
    "very little has been said about how to manipulate large families of differential invariants , except for the important work by fulling _",
    "@xcite , because the problem is much more complicated . here",
    "we shall apply and generalize the techniques we proposed in @xcite to cover this case , extending our tensor computer algebra system _ invar _ to handle both the algebraic and the differential invariants of the riemann tensor .",
    "as in @xcite we shall work on a manifold of dimension @xmath5 with a metric field @xmath6 and its associated structures : the ( torsionless ) levi - civita connection @xmath7 , its riemann tensor @xmath8 and ( when restricting to @xmath9 ) the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ".    our main objective is constructing a basis of independent _ invariants _ ( that is , scalars formed from contraction of several riemann tensors and their @xmath13-derivatives ) and _ dual invariants _ ( those also having an @xmath10 tensor ) , along with all polynomial relations giving any other _ dependent _ invariant in terms of those in the basis . the restricted algebraic case without derivatives of riemann has been essentially solved , both from the computational point of view @xcite and , after a long series of contributions , from the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "the general case is much more complicated and remains , however , nearly unexplored .",
    "the only article known to us in this direction is the work by fulling _",
    "@xcite in which , using young tableaux techniques , they were able to compute numbers of independent _ nondual _ invariants in the basis for a variety of cases , in different dimensions .",
    "they also gave the members of the basis for the simpler of those cases , but no expansions of the dependent invariants were provided , rendering the result unpractical .",
    "this article fills in that important gap by recomputing the basis of invariants ( hence confirming for the first time the results in @xcite ) together with a database of expressions of any other independent invariant in terms of the basis .",
    "following fulling _ et al . _",
    "@xcite we separate the set of all monomial invariants of _ degree _ @xmath14 ( the number of riemann tensors ) in subsets @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the differentiation order of the @xmath17-th riemann tensor , assuming the tensors have been sorted such that @xmath18 .",
    "an @xmath14-tuple @xmath19 will be referred to as a _ case _ , with the corresponding invariants having @xmath20 indices and order @xmath21 , the number of derivatives of the metric , not to be confused with the total number of derivatives of the riemann tensors , which is @xmath22 .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are always even numbers because we only consider scalar expressions , with all indices paired among them .",
    "for example an invariant of the case @xmath25 , hence with @xmath26 indices and order @xmath27 , is @xmath28 sets of dual invariants and dual cases will be denoted with an asterisk , as in @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the algebraic cases considered in @xcite are denoted here as @xmath31 for degree @xmath14 .",
    "we shall see that commutation of derivatives produces relations among invariants of different cases , because it converts second derivatives into additional riemann tensors .",
    "this operation changes both the degree @xmath14 and the differentiation orders @xmath16 of the riemann tensors , but not the total order @xmath24 of metric derivatives .",
    "this allows a simple classification of the relations , which are all homogeneous in @xmath24 . following again ref .",
    "@xcite we give results up to @xmath32 , which consistently fills the gap among the algebraic cases of degrees 1 to 7 ( that is @xmath33 to @xmath34 ) in @xcite .",
    "concerning duals , we give results up to @xmath35 , also consistent with the algebraic degrees 1 to 5 of @xcite .",
    "see tables [ table12345 ] , [ table67 ] , [ dualtable ] for the actual list of cases considered in this investigation , already sorted by their corresponding values of @xmath24 : there are 48 nondual cases and 15 dual cases to treat . in the following ,",
    "when talking about total numbers of invariants and relations , we always include the 7 nondual and 5 dual algebraic cases already considered in @xcite .",
    "relations among riemann invariants are a consequence of the symmetries obeyed by the riemann tensor and its @xmath13-derivatives .",
    "there are six different symmetries we can exploit and so we proceed in six respective consecutive _ steps _ , each producing new relations and therefore decreasing the number of independent invariants , as shown in tables [ table12345 ] , [ table67 ] and [ dualtable ] ( note that steps 3 and 4 are new with respect to @xcite ) :    1 .   permutation symmetries .",
    "the riemann tensor obeys the following symmetries under permutations of indices : @xmath36 as explained in @xcite this type of tensor symmetry , and the induced symmetries in tensor products , can be efficiently handled using fast algorithms for manipulation of permutation groups @xcite . in our system , each monomial is converted in real time to its canonical form .",
    "for example , the canonical form of invariant ( [ invariant ] ) is @xmath37 this process is very fast : see figure [ timings7riemann ] for an histogram of timings of a case with 28 indices . in this way",
    ", we enormously reduce the number of invariants we need to control .",
    "there are @xmath38 invariants for case \\{0,1,3}. as shown in table [ table12345 ] , there are 3237 different canonical forms ( column ` canon ' ) , and if we remove products of invariants of lower degree , this number is further reduced to 3099 ( column ` invars ' ) , which are indexed from @xmath39 to @xmath40 . the whole column",
    "` invars ' has been constructed by canonicalization of a supercomplete set of more than 20 million permutations in 15 hours , giving 640119 different nondual canonical forms and 7698 canonical duals .",
    "those canonical forms were then sorted within each case according to the following priorities : i ) invariants with more ( differentiated ) ricci scalars are sorted first ; ii ) invariants with more ricci tensors are sorted first ; iii ) more laplacians first ; iv ) ordering based on indices .",
    "the indexing of algebraic invariants in the first version of _ invar _ has been preserved for backwards compatibility .",
    "+ we do not consider at this step symmetries coming from permutation of covariant derivatives acting on scalar expressions .",
    "they will be treated in step 4 .",

    "the riemann tensor obeys the multiterm symmetry @xmath41 } = 0 $ ] . for each canonical invariant after step 1 we generate several cyclic relations by replacing @xmath8 by its 3-index antisymmetrized part in all possible inequivalent ways .",
    "for example , from the canonical form ( [ canonical ] ) we get three cyclic relations ( already canonicalized ) : @xmath42 + in terms of indexed invariants those are respectively @xmath43 allowing to express @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in terms of lower - index invariants .",

    "the results are then simplified using the information of steps 1 and 2 .",
    "for example from the canonical invariant ( [ canonical ] ) we get a zero equation and @xmath52 in terms of indexed invariants and using step 2 this is @xmath53 so that @xmath54 is no longer an independent invariant .",
    "4 .   commutation of derivatives . given any tensor @xmath55",
    "we have @xmath56 we generate new equations by exchanging the order of all consecutive covariant derivatives in the canonical invariants after step 1 . as we have already mentioned , in this step different cases are mixed because second covariant derivatives are converted into riemann tensors , and so we find equations involving cases with the same order @xmath24 but larger degree , that is @xmath57 and @xmath58 in our example ( [ canonical ] ) : under commutation of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and after the use of steps 1 , 2 and 3 we get @xmath61 the equations at this step , once expanded in terms of independent invariants , become very long , many of them having several thousand terms for @xmath32 .",
    "this is because in step 4 we still have 6368 independent invariants , without even counting the 1639 objects from the algebraic degree-7 case .",
    "the hardest case to build is \\{10 } , taking nearly 300 hours of cpu time and containing equations with up to 5617 terms ( independent invariants ) . +",
    "our results in columns ` commute ' of tables [ table12345 ] and [ table67 ] perfectly coincide with those of column ` total ' of appendix a of fulling _ et al . _",
    "@xcite after dealing with the fact that they count product invariants .",
    "note that they do not study dual invariants and so everything in table [ dualtable ] is new .",
    "dimensionally dependent identities ( also called lovelock type identities ) : antisymmetrization in @xmath62 indices in dimension @xmath5 gives zero @xcite .",
    "we generate a large number of those equations for dimension 4 by antisymmetrization of random groups of 5 indices in each independent invariant after step 1 .",
    "+ again , our results in column ` 4d ' of tables [ table12345 ] and [ table67 ] agree with those of fulling _ et al .",
    "they give no results for dual invariants .",
    "6 .   duals .",
    "a product of two @xmath63 tensors can be given as a linear combination of products of @xmath64 s and hence a product of two dual invariants can be expressed as a linear combination of nondual invariants .",
    "we have combined the dual invariants in pairs in all possible ways , obtaining 51 relations which allow decomposing 51 independent invariants after step 5 into products of dual invariants .",
    "we have chosen this order of use of symmetries because only steps 15 are signature independent , only steps 14 are dimension independent , steps 13 do not mix cases , steps 12 do not involve derivatives , and finally step 1 employs only permutation symmetries , which must be used first . note the importance of not decomposing riemann in its weyl and ricci parts , which would make the process dimension - dependent right from the outset .",
    ".[table12345]number of independent non - dual invariants after the different steps of simplification : 0 ) ` canon ' : canonical invariants including products of lower degree ; 1 ) ` invars ' : canonical invariants without products ; 2 ) ` cyclic ' : invariants after imposing the cyclic symmetry ; 3 ) ` bianchi ' : invariants after imposing the bianchi identity ; 4 ) ` commute ' : invariants after commuting covariant derivatives ; 5 ) ` 4d ' : invariants after imposing all possible dimensionally dependent identities for dimension 4 ; and 6 ) ` duals ' : independent invariants after decomposition in products of duals .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the implementation of the new database of relations among the differential invariants closely follows that of our previous version of _ invar _ @xcite .",
    "in particular the commands given in appendices c and d of @xcite are still valid , with minimal changes , the most important of them being the fact that now the different cases are identified by the case list of orders ` { 0,1,3 } ` in the _ mathematica _ version and ` [ 0,1,3 ] ` in the _ maple _ version rather than an integer degree .",
    "therefore an invariant is now denoted as ` rinv[{0,1,3 } , 2595 ] ` or ` dualrinv[{1,3 } , 920 ] ` in _ mathematica _ and ` rinv[[0,1,3 ] , 2595 ] ` or ` dualrinv[[1,3 ] , 920 ] ` in _",
    "maple_. the old notation ` rinv[3 , 9 ] ` for an algebraic invariant is automatically translated to its new notation ` rinv[{0,0,0 } , 9 ] ` in _ mathematica _ and ` rinv[[0,0,0 ] , 9 ] ` in _ maple_.    the system now handles derivatives of tensorial expressions .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath7 is treated as an operator and denoted ` cd[-a ] ` in our tensor computer algebra systems .",
    "hence , we can represent the invariant @xmath65 as ` cd[c][r[a , b ,- a ,-",

    "_ and _ canon _ are linear operators and automatically obey the standard rules @xcite , in particular the leibnitz rule for products .",
    "the canonicalization algorithms consistently manipulate derivatives and only one comment is required , concerning how the different riemann tensors are sorted in a given invariant : we follow the convention of having tensors with more covariant derivatives on the right to help the canonicalizer , which starts placing indices on the left .",

    "@xmath69    the database of relations is arranged as follows : there is a file for each step and case ( so @xmath70 files in total ) containing the relations at that step among the invariants of that case and all previous cases . the full database takes more than 1.5 gbytes of memory and even more once it is read by the computer algebra systems .",
    "most of it comes from the 13 last cases of order 12 at the commutation step ( step 4 ) , and so we provide alternative smaller files in which the rules have not been fully expanded in terms of independent invariants of previous cases .",
    "the user can configure the system to read either the fully expanded files or the non - expanded files in those cases .",
    "if the latter are chosen then repeated ( up to four times ) use of the simplification functions might be needed to fully expand an invariant , resulting in a slower process . with non - expanded files we have 365mbytes of data .",
    "we have successfully extended our tensor computer algebra package _ invar _ to handle differential invariants of the riemann tensor up to 12 derivatives of the metric . unlike the problem of algebraic invariants ,",
    "to which a great deal of effort has been dedicated in the last decades , the problem of differential invariants remained almost unexplored due to its much more difficult character : two new sources of equations come into play , namely the bianchi identity and the non - commutation of covariant derivatives .",
    "this article has completely solved the problem for those cases most likely to be needed in current computations .",
    "the problem has been solved in the most useful way : by providing a database with all equations coming from multiterm symmetries , such that any invariant can be immediately looked up without the need of inefficient intermediate computations .",
    "the new database is much larger than its previous version , now containing 645625 relations for 647817 canonical invariants ( counting both dual and nondual invariants ) .",
    "this represents an increase by a factor larger than 30 with respect to the 21221 relations for 21246 invariants in the old database . but",
    "this investigation is not only a quantitative extension of @xcite .",
    "we have also extended our algorithms to handle derivatives and their associated symmetries : bianchi and commutation .",
