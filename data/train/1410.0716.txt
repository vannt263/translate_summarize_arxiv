    "in recent years , performance of various communication tasks over an optical channel  when limited only by the fundamental noise of quantum mechanical origin  have been extensively studied .",
    "a few examples are : finding the communication capacities of the lossy optical channel for transmitting classical information  @xcite , quantum information  @xcite , and that for transmitting both classical and quantum information simultaneously in the presence of a limited amount of pre - shared entanglement  @xcite .",
    "one of the biggest breakthroughs in optical communication using quantum effects was the invention of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , which is a suite of protocols that can generate information - theoretically - secure shared secret keys  @xcite between two distant parties alice and bob over a lossy - noisy optical channel , with the assistance of a two - way authenticated public classical channel .",
    "security of qkd leverages quantum properties of light to ensure the generated shared keys are secure from the most powerful adversary that is physically consistent with the channel noise collectively estimated by alice and bob ( despite the fact that much of that noise may actually be caused by non - adversarial or natural causes ) .",
    "various qkd protocols have been proposed in the last three decades  @xcite , some of which have been transitioning to practice  @xcite .",
    "for all the communication protocols discussed above , the rates decrease rapidly with channel loss . for the task of classical communication over an ideal pure - loss channel ( modeled by a beamsplitter of transmittance @xmath0 ) , at",
    "any given value of the channel transmittance @xmath0 , no matter how small , the data rate can in principle be increased without bound by increasing the input power  @xcite . for qkd ,",
    "this is not the case . for several well - known qkd protocols ( such as bb84  @xcite with single photons and bb84 with weak laser light encoding and decoy states , e91  @xcite with an ideal entanglement source , and cv - qkd with gaussian modulation  @xcite ) , the secret key rate @xmath1 decays linearly with channel transmittance @xmath0 in the high - loss ( @xmath2 ) regime  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that this linear rate - transmittance scaling over the lossy bosonic channel  for secure - key generation with two - way public classical communication assistance  is impossible to improve upon , no matter how one may design a qkd protocol , or how much input power is used  @xcite . to be specific , the secret key rate of any qkd protocol must be upper bounded by @xmath3 measured in bits / mode and given by @xmath4 which equals @xmath5 , for @xmath2 .",
    "this fundamental rate - loss upper bound also applies to the following related tasks : quantum communication ( sending qubits noiselessly over a lossy channel ) , direct secure communication  @xcite , and entanglement generation ( where each task may also use assistance of a separate authenticated two - way classical communication channel , in addition to transmissions over the quantum lossy bosonic channel itself )  @xcite .",
    "as we discussed above , for classical communication over an ideal lossy channel , one could in principle increase the input power without bound as the loss increases , to maintain a required data rate .",
    "however , an unbounded input power is impractical both from the point of view of the availability of a laser that is powerful enough , and also to avoid hitting up against the fiber s non - linearity - driven peak power constraint .",
    "this is why traditionally , electrical regenerators have been used to compensate for loss in long - haul optical fiber communications , which help restore the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the digitally - modulated signals by periodically detecting and regenerating clean optical pulses . over the last few decades , all - optical amplifiers , such as erbium - doped fiber amplifiers ( edfas ) ,",
    "have become popular in lieu of electrical regenerators , both due to their greater speeds as well as the low noise of modern edfas .",
    "caves analyzed the fundamental quantum limits on the noise performance of optical amplifiers  @xcite , for both phase - insensitive ( pia ) and phase - sensitive amplifiers ( psa ) .",
    "loudon analyzed the fundamental limitations on the overall snr to ` chains ' of loss segments and optical amplifiers , both in the context of phase - sensitive ( coherent detection ) receivers , as well as direct detection receivers  @xcite .",
    "for qkd , one way to beat the linear rate - transmittance scaling is to break up the channel into low - loss segments by introducing physically - secured center stations ; in this approach the overall key rate is still upper bounded by @xmath6 $ ] bits / mode , but @xmath7 is the transmittance of the longest ( lossiest ) segment .",
    "quantum repeaters are conceptual devices  @xcite , which if supplied at these intermediate stations , can beat the linear rate - transmission scaling without having to physically secure them .",
    "there is an approach to build a quantum repeater using one - way communication only  @xcite , so they can act as passive untended devices .",
    "however , such structured implementations of those devices require quantum error correction codes operating on blocks of multiple qubits .",
    "a recently - proposed repeater protocol  @xcite even eliminates the requirement of a quantum memory , but utilizes photonic cluster states .",
    "building a functional quantum repeater is subject to intensive fundamental research , but is currently far from being a deployable technology .",
    "the natural question that thus arises  in analogy to loudon s setup for classical optical communication  @xcite  is whether all - optical amplifiers ( pias or psas ) , left untended and inserted at regular intervals , might act to some degree as quantum repeaters and thereby help boost the distances over which qkd can be performed over a lossy channel .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : mainresults ] we summarize the main results derived in this article to put it into perspective .",
    "a central finding is a decomposition of a lossy quantum channel with intermediate bosonic gaussian channel stations into another form without any insertion of middle stations as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "we then continue into the technical part . in section  [ sec : gaussian ]",
    ", we give an overview of bosonic gaussian states and channels . in section  [ sec : gaussianstations ] , we analyze the scenario when a general multi - mode gaussian channel is inserted between two pure - loss segments , and show how one can collect the entire pure loss in the center of the channel by appropriate modifications to the transmitter and the receiver . in section  [ sec : ebconditions ] , we consider single - mode gaussian stations , and delineate the conditions for when the gaussian center station renders the concatenation with the losses on its two sides , an entanglement - breaking channel .",
    "the quantum limited stations , the psa and the pia , are addressed as special cases .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with a summary of the main results , and thoughts for future work .",
    "-mode gaussian channel @xmath8 sandwiched between two pure - loss channel segments @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , can be decomposed into a single lossy channel @xmath11 sandwiched by a pair of gaussian channels , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the net loss in the channel is the sum ( in db ) of the losses of the two individual lossy segments , i.e. , @xmath14 and the gaussian channel at the receiver end @xmath13 is a gaussian unitary map .",
    "( b ) using this transformation recursively , one can ` push ' a collection of general gaussian center stations interspersed through a lossy channel ( b.1 ) to a single gaussian operation at the input , and a single gaussian operation at the output ( b.2 ) of the entire loss accumulated in the center . ]",
    "in this paper , we show that such is not possible when those all - optical amplifiers are limited to gaussian channels .",
    "note that by using the word `` channel '' we automatically imply the action to be trace - preserving .",
    "examples of such channels involve beamsplitters , phase - shifters and squeezers  @xcite .",
    "we prove our claim by transforming a concatenation of two lossy channel segments with a gaussian channel in the middle , as a pair of gaussian channels at the two ends , with the total loss collected in the middle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) .",
    "the implication of our no - go result is that if gaussian channels are employed in center station(s ) placed along a lossy channel , the overall qkd key rate , for any qkd protocol , must be upper bounded by @xmath15 $ ] bits / mode , with @xmath0 being the total end - to - end channel transmittance .",
    "simple protocols such as laser - decoy - based bb84 , or gaussian - modulated laser - based cv protocols , with no repeaters , can already attain key rates that have the optimal ( linear ) rate - transmittance scaling and are only a small constant factor below the general upper bound  @xcite .    for any optical communication protocol over a lossy channel interspersed with gaussian stations ,",
    "our result shows there exists _ another _ protocol with the same performance that does not use any intermediate station , which can be derived from the original protocol by suitably amending the transmitted signals and the receiver measurement .",
    "our result does _ not _ preclude a gaussian channel in the middle of the lossy channel to improve the performance of a _ given _ protocol , _ if _ the transmitter and receiver are held to be the same . nor",
    "does it preclude the existence of scenarios where it might be technologically easier to implement a protocol with such intermediate stations , as opposed to modifying the transmitter and the receiver per the prescription generated by our analysis .",
    "an example of such improvement is the increased range of a qkd protocol with a given level of detector noise ( although , any increase in range must be consistent with the @xmath16 rate - transmission scaling ) .     given that the overall rate - transmission scaling can not be changed , the question remains whether there might be other implementation advantages of gaussian center stations .",
    "it turns out that there are strict conditions on such a scenario . to demonstrate this , we delineate the conditions under which a gaussian center station causes a lossy channel to become entanglement breaking ( eb ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that qkd is not possible on an eb channel , since the output of an eb channel can be simulated quantitatively correctly using a measure - and - prepare scheme  @xcite .",
    "the pure lossy channel is not eb by itself for any non - zero transmittance , @xmath17 .",
    "let us illustrate our reasoning for the better known case of classical communication over pure - loss bosonic channels .",
    "the channel capacity of the lossy bosonic channel ( described by single photon transmittance @xmath0 ) using signals with mean photon number @xmath18 per mode , is given by @xmath19 bits per mode  @xcite .",
    "we see , that increasing the mean photon number increases the classical communication rate . in practice",
    ", it is impractical to keep increasing the mean photon number due to non - linear effects in the fiber that limit the input power and can distort the signals .",
    "for these reasons , one limits the input power and builds optical amplifiers ( phase sensitive or phase insensitive ) into the fiber . according to our theorems , for the ideal loss - only bosonic channel",
    ", the setup of lossy segments with intermediate amplifiers is equivalent to a new transmitter consisting of the old transmitter combined with a very strong amplifier , followed by a transfer through the full distance of the lossy bosonic channel , and then a receiver consisting of a combination of another amplifier and on the original receiver .",
    "this replacement protocol corresponds to the situation of using a large input mean photon number , and realizes the classical capacity of the lossy bosonic channel .",
    "what we learn is that the intermediate amplifiers do not increase the channel capacity of the lossy bosonic channel , but realize an equivalent protocol that keeps the optical signals  throughout the communication channel  within a peak power level that is sufficiently below the level where non - linear effects would be encountered .    in qkd ,",
    "the secrecy capacity of the lossy bosonic channel does not increase unboundedly with the input power of the signals , thus using strong signal pulses pushing into the non - linear domain of fibers is not important for qkd protocols : the use of equivalent replacement schemes utilizing optical amplifiers would not give any advantage . to the contrary",
    ", amplifiers will add additional noise which will eventually be detrimental to the performance of the qkd protocol , with the exception of effects of noisy pre - processing that can increase the secret key rate compared to protocols not using this approach  @xcite .",
    "note however that noisy pre - processing can not improve on the fundamental secrecy capacity of the lossy bosonic channel , which is solely a function of the channel s end - to - end loss .",
    "our main result adds to the list of no - go results for gaussian operations in quantum information protocols , i.e. , those that can not be performed with gaussian operations and classical processing alone",
    ". some examples are universal quantum computing  @xcite , entanglement distillation of gaussian states  @xcite , optimal cloning of coherent states  @xcite , optimal discrimination of coherent states  @xcite , gaussian quantum error correction  @xcite , and building a joint - detection receiver for classical communication  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will provide a basic introduction to the mathematics of gaussian states and channels , sufficient to develop the results in this paper . for a more detailed account , see ref .",

    "we show an explicit calculation demonstrating how mean displacement terms can be separated out in any concatenation of gaussian channels .    in the following subsections , we will delve a little deeper into properties of single - mode gaussian channels that we use later on .",
    "the symplectic matrix @xmath38 in eq .   of a gaussian unitary",
    "can always be decomposed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a positive diagonal matrix , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are orthogonal symplectic matrices ( @xmath54 )  @xcite .",

    "therefore a general gaussian unitary operation can always be decomposed into passive linear optics ( beamsplitters and phase shifters ) , single - mode squeezing and single - mode displacement operations .    therefore , up to a displacement , a single - mode gaussian unitary ( described by its symplectic matrix @xmath38 ) can be decomposed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the symplectic matrix of a single - mode phase rotation , and @xmath57 is the symplectic matrix of a single - mode ( phase - quadrature ) squeezer .",
    "note that it is sufficient to restrict the above decomposition to a phase - quadrature squeezer , is because one can absorb any additional phase in the squeezing operation into @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is because the symplectic matrix of a single - mode squeezer with gain @xmath60 and squeezing angle @xmath61 can be expressed as @xmath62      an _ entanglement breaking _ ( eb ) channel is one whose action on one half of an entangled state ( with an identity map on the other half ) always yields a _ separable _ state .",

    ".    the measure - and - prepare representation of an eb channel implies that the channel s quantum transmission can be seen as transmission of the ( probabilistic ) classical information obtained as a result of a hard quantum measurement made on the channel s input .",
    "this is the intuition behind why such a channel has zero secret - key capacity , and thus can not be useful for qkd  @xcite .",
    "because of this reason , when we analyze concatenations of several gaussian center stations for potential use as repeaters , we will limit our discussion to the case when all the channels @xmath77 in the concatenation are non eb ( since this is a necessary condition for qkd ) .",
    "note however that when interspersed with loss segments , even when all center stations are non - eb , the overall input - output map can become eb  a topic that we will discuss in more detail later in section  [ sec : ebconditions ] .      our analysis of general one - mode gaussian operations will be based on the standard forms of such operations obtained from the unitary equivalence classification of quantum channels developed by holevo  @xcite .",

    "the condition for @xmath143 to be eb , translates to @xmath173      in this subsection we illustrate our results in section  [ sec : general_noneb ] with the important example of optical amplifiers used as center stations .",
    "we will consider the cases of a phase - sensitive amplifier ( psa ) and phase - insensitive amplifier ( pia ) .",
    "detailed proofs of the results will be deferred to appendix  [ sec : psapia ] .",
    "if the center station @xmath8 is a psa of gain @xmath174 , then the composition @xmath142 becomes eb if the gain @xmath175 exceeds a threshold @xmath176 as @xmath177 ( see appendix  [ sec : psa_app ] for proof . ) if @xmath8 is a pia of gain @xmath178 , then @xmath143 becomes eb if the gain @xmath178 exceeds a threshold value @xmath179 ( see appendix  [ sec : pia_app ] for proof ) : @xmath180 note that the transmittance @xmath109 of the loss segment _ after _ the pia does not play a role in determining when @xmath143 becomes eb .",
    "the expression for the threshold shows that when the channel transmittance @xmath106 of a the initial is low , an amplifier with even a small amount of gain can render the lossy channel eb .",
    "finally , the concatenation of a chain of psa center stations , @xmath181 , can be decomposedas @xmath182 , where @xmath12 is a psa at the channel input ( of an appropriate gain and squeezing angle ) followed by classical thermal noise addition , @xmath183 is the entire channel loss collected in the middle , and @xmath13 is a psa at the channel output . for expressions of the gain and phase parameters of the psas at the transmitter and the receiver , see appendix  [ sec : psachain ] .",
    "we note here that pias can improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a sub - unity - efficiency optical heterodyne detection receiver , albeit up to 3 db of the quantum limited snr , when preceding the receiver .",
    "psas on the other hand have been proposed for use in optical imaging  @xcite and secure - key generation  @xcite , to boost the effective detection efficiency of homodyne detection receivers , in principle pushing the receiver s performance all the way to the quantum limited snr , by preceding the receiver with a psa whose gain quadrature is phase - matched to the homodyne detector s local oscillator . despite these practical uses of optical amplifiers , our results in the earlier sections show that these amplifiers can not increase the secret key capacity , and the results in the current section show that it is unlikely that they will help to realize the given secret key capacity in a practical implementation .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that for qkd ( secure key generation ) , along with a few other optical quantum communication tasks such as quantum ( qubit ) communication , entanglement generation , and direct - secure communication ( each with two - way authenticated classical communication assistance ) , the rates are upper bounded by @xmath15 $ ] bits per mode over a pure - loss optical channel of transmittance @xmath0 .",
    "this upper bound reads @xmath5 when @xmath2 ( high loss ) , which translates to an exponential decay of rate with distance @xmath184 in fiber ( @xmath185 ) , and an inverse - square decay with @xmath184 in free - space ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "quantum repeaters are conceptual devices that , when inserted along the lossy channel , can help circumvent this rate - loss trade - off .    in this paper , we have proven the inefficacy of bosonic gaussian channels  optical processes that can be assembled using passive linear optics ( beamsplitters and phase - shifters ) and squeezers ( phase - sensitive amplifiers , and the interaction of parametric downconversion)to be used as quantum repeaters .",
    "we prove this by showing that any concatenation of such untended gaussian operations along a lossy channel can be simulated by one gaussian operation at the channel input and one at the channel output , where the entire loss in the channel is collected in the middle .",
    "we thereby argue that any communication protocol that uses such a chain of gaussian center stations can be replaced by another protocol of the same performance without those stations , the transmitter and receiver of which are slightly modified versions of those used by the original protocol . as a consequence , the upper bound @xmath3 , as shown above , still applies .",
    "note , however , that our formulation is entirely based on the property of gaussian channels and does not preclude the possibility that a trace - decreasing gaussian operation @xcite could serve as a quantum repeater .",
    "it would be possible that intermediate trace - preserving gaussian operations could be of practical advantage , while the same performance of any protocol working with such middle stations is in principle achievable _ without _ middle stations . in order to demonstrate practical restrictions for use of conventional gaussian stations",
    ", we separately analyzed the case of a general single - mode gaussian channel sandwiched between lossy channels .",
    "we derived the conditions that the center station renders the end to end lossy channel entanglement breaking , and hence useless for qkd . from special cases for quantum - limited optical amplifiers as center stations",
    ", we found that in a high - loss regime , even modest amplification gains will render the overall channel entanglement breaking .",
