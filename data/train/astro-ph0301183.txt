    "that local intergalactic space could harbor substantial amounts of hot , highly ionized gas , either as an extended halo surrounding the galaxy , or as an extended medium pervading the local group , was first suggested by spitzer ( 1956 ) and by kahn and woltjer ( 1959 ) .",
    "such a medium would have a characteristic temperature of order the virial temperature , estimated to be on the order of @xmath8 , and be of very low density , @xmath9  @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "its emission , mainly soft thermal line emission from highly ionized metals and weak thermal bremsstrahlung , would be very faint and extremely difficult to detect , and searches for diffuse hot gas have relied on detecting its absorption lines in bright background continuum sources .",
    "detailed studies of li - like c and o absorption lines in the uv in background quasar spectra have indeed revealed the presence of gas in the galactic halo ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and , more recently , beyond ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "intergalactic x - ray absorption spectroscopy has long been recognized as having the potential of revealing more highly ionized gas , but the required spectroscopic sensitivity has only recently become available with the diffraction grating spectrometers on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the first detection of resonance absorption lines from h- and he - like oxygen and neon , in a spectrum of the bright bl lac object pks  2155@xmath1304 with the _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating spectrometer , was recently reported ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we report on multiple detections of the @xmath11 resonance lines in h- and he - like oxygen in deep spectra of pks  2155@xmath1304 , mkn 421 , and 3c  273 , obtained with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on _ xmm - newton_. the lines appear at zero redshift , with characteristic equivalent widths of 15  m ; the line in mrk  421 appears marginally resolved , with a characteristic velocity width of @xmath12",
    ". we will argue that the bulk of the absorption in these lines arises in an extended low density medium in near collisional equilibrium , well outside our galaxy , which is likely the long sought - for intragroup medium of the local group .",
    "weak x - ray absorption features are detectable only when spectra of sufficient photon statistics were acquired with the grating spectrometers , and when various systematic effects of the detectors to the histogrammed data sets can be minimized . to prepare such spectra , we combined the available spectroscopic data toward the three high latitude agns from a combination of calibration , performance verification , and guaranteed time observation data sets available to the _ xmm - newton _ rgs team . using all of the available datasets , the effective exposure times added up to 412 , 274 and 265 ksec for 3c  273 , mrk  421 and pks  2155@xmath1304 , respectively .",
    "custom software was used to operate on the observation data file ( odf ) in each case , to produce spectra aligned to the same dataspace grid .",
    "the custom software is identical in function to , and shares a common origin with , the rgs branch of the science analysis subsystem ( sas ) , except that it allowed a flexible means by which to reduce systematic effects to the data . because there is a residual pointing uncertainty on the order of 2  for the analysis at this time",
    ", the reported velocities should be accompanied by systematic wavelength uncertainties of order of @xmath135m , or @xmath14 for a line close to 20 .",
    "the relative error in wavelength between two line measurements from the same observation is much lower .    because agns typically have variable spectra , the continuum spectrum from each observation was fit separately , and the ratio spectra ( `` data : folded model '' ) were counts  weighted to yield a final absorption spectrum toward each of the agns .",
    "these are displayed in figure  [ fig : abs_comparison ] , uncorrected for instrumental and interstellar absorption features . for comparison",
    ", the spectrum of capella is displayed on the top panel , which can be used to identify the locations of strong transitions in the rest frame .",
    "each agn spectrum exhibits a clear signature of intervening by the @xmath11 he@xmath4 transition at 21.60 .",
    "hints of the @xmath11 ly@xmath4 and @xmath15 he@xmath16 transitions are also seen at 18.63 and 18.97 , respectively .",
    "we fit the absorption line profiles in the data within xspec using a voigt model folded through the instrumental redistribution matrices .",
    "a quantitative summary of the absorption features measured is given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the spectrum toward mrk  421 had superior statistics , and provided detections in four transitions : @xmath11 in , , and .",
    "of these , the strongest absorption feature ( ) appears to be marginally resolved , and yields an ionic velocity dispersion @xmath17 between 200 and 560  @xmath18 , based on 90% confidence levels and , in a gaussian approximation to the line  of  sight velocity distribution characterized by @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in most cases , fitting the absorption features works significantly better when a line broadening mechanism beyond the thermal velocity distribution is included .",
    "while the measured line equivalent widths ( from voigt profile fitting ) are given in table  [ tab : results ] , estimating the corresponding ionic column densities ( @xmath21 ) requires an assumption of the velocity distribution .",
    "the rightmost column gives a conservative lower limit to the true column density for each ion species measured : we use the 90% lower limit to the equivalent width of the feature , and then tabulate the corresponding ionic column density in the unsaturated limit .",
    "the true column density , however , can depend strongly on the true velocity distribution for a given measured equivalent width .",
    "for example , for both mrk  421 and 3c  273 , the inferred @xmath21 values increase by a factor of 2 when the velocity dispersion parameter is reduced to @xmath22 from @xmath23 , where the fits provide marginally better @xmath24 values .",

    "while there are in most cases systemic velocities and @xmath75 that satisfy the 90% limits for both lines for a given agn , the differences seen in them evoke a possible situation where the absorption features may probe different velocity components , and therefore different phases of the intervening gas .",
    "when a fit was performed simutaneously to the and features with velocity parameters tied , a lower equivalent width and column density was derived for the feature , because the fit was driven by details of the feature profile ",
    "additional velocity components are then required to fit the excess . from the column density ratios for to derived this way ( 0.3 for mrk  421 to 0.8 for pks  2155 ) we estimate the electron temperatures by assuming collisional equilibrium and that the and occupy the same volume .",
    "the electron temperature range , according to this assumption , is @xmath76  k , which brackets the 1@xmath77 confidences for each of the targets .",
    "collisional excitation and emission from the same medium may be estimated from the rosat all  sky survey toward these lines of sight .",
    "alternatively , a better estimate of the emission line contribution to the diffuse x  ray background is provided by results of a recent sounding rocket experiment ( x  ray quantum calorimeter , @xcite ) .",
    "their analysis estimated that the oxygen line fluxes ( for @xmath78 ) together account for 32% of the r4 band count rates . however , because the calorimeter provided individual line fluxes ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath79 in the triplet ) electron densities and lengths through the emitter ",
    "absorber may be estimated . in the approximation",
    "that the medium has a uniform density and temperature out to some distance @xmath80 , the ionic column density should be @xmath81 and the diffuse emission intensity @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the elemental abundance , ionic fraction and collisional rate coefficient for the transition , respectively .",
    "since the ion column density is formally a lower limit and the surface brightness is an upper limit to true diffuse contribution , an upper limit to the electron density @xmath86 can be estimated in a way that is independent of oxygen abundance .",
    "then , by assuming an oxygen abundance and ionic fraction , a lower limit to the length @xmath80 is estimated .",
    "figure  [ fig : l_ne_m_constraints ] shows a graphical solution to the emitter  absorber for a range of temperatures and some assumptions ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) . from the temperature @xmath91 inferred from the column density ratios , the electron density estimate yields @xmath5 and a length scale @xmath92 , @xmath0  40 times larger ( and more tenuous ) than the absorbing galactic halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this initial survey of @xmath2 absorption by highly ionized gas in the high galactic latitude pointings provide a picture of igm in the local group that can be tested toward other galaxies in poor groups . with impact parameters on the order of 100  kpc from spiral galaxies such as our own ,",
    "the spectra of more distant agns should contain absorption features with characteristic column densities of @xmath93 in .",
    "such extended , tenuous halos or intragroup gas should consequently be accompanied by a diffuse glow , that would only double the local surface brightness of the x  ray background s diffuse and line  rich component on the 100  kpc scale , and would be very difficult to detect ."
