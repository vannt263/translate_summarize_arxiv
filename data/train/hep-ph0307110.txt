    "dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations provide a prominent approach to physics of strong interactions .",

    "@xcite , consists of _ ab initio _ studies of ds equations for green s functions of qcd , typically in the landau gauge ( lg ) .",
    "the other aspect consists of phenomenological ds studies ( also typically in lg ) of hadrons as quark bound states , but relying more on modeling ; e.g. , see a recent review @xcite .",
    "such phenomenological studies have mostly been relying on the rainbow - ladder approximation ( rla ) , where generation of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath3sb ) is well - understood @xcite .",
    "as it has been stressed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , rla is the leading - order term of a procedure @xcite that can be systematically improved towards less severe truncations of ds equations .",
    "this general procedure provides a means to identify _ a priori _ the channels in which rla is likely to work well @xcite .",
    "pseudoscalar mesons are the most notable among those channels because of the correct chiral qcd behavior due to d@xmath3sb and goldstone theorem , since ( almost ) massless pseudoscalar mesons are reproduced in the ( vicinity of ) chiral limit not only by the exact qcd treatment but also by all consistent truncations such as rla @xcite .",

    "thus , the overall situation is that there is progress @xcite , but that further investigation and elucidation of the origin of phenomenologically successful effective interaction kernels remains one of primary challenges in ds studies @xcite . here",
    ", we will point out that such an interaction kernel for ds studies results from combining the ds ideas on @xmath19 of the form ( [ alkofalpha ] ) @xcite and the ideas @xcite on the dimension 2 gluon condensate @xmath31 _ in lg_.",

    "these now well - established propagator contributions ( [ kondoz])-([gluonmass ] ) then suggest the importance of @xmath0 for the ds approach to hadrons , where propagators , usually in lg , are used to get solutions for quark bound states and calculate observable quantities .",
    "notably , see ref .",
    "@xcite for gauge - parameter independent expressions for @xmath29 and a generalization of the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation ( gmor ) that demonstrates gauge - parameter independence of the meson mass .",
    "still , how can @xmath0 influence these observable quantities , since this condensate is _ not _ gauge - invariant ?",
    "it turns out @xcite that in lg , @xmath0 equals a non - local , but gauge - invariant quantity : the minimal ( with respect to the choice of gauge ) value of @xmath43 integrated over the space - time , indicating that @xmath0 in lg may have a physical meaning .",
    "outside lg , besides @xmath0 other ( ghost ) condensates of dimension 2 appear @xcite .",
    "they very likely cancel the variation which @xmath0 suffers in going to another gauge , since the physics behind all these different dimension 2 condensates in different gauges must be the same : gluon - ghost condensation lowers the qcd vacuum energy @xmath44 , which is a physical , gauge - invariant quantity , to a stable ( `` @xmath45 '' ) vacuum @xcite .    for @xmath46 , lg lattice studies of boucaud _ et al . _",

    "( [ kondoz ] ) and ( [ kondog ] ) , one expects a prominent role of the dimension 4 gluon condensate @xmath52 , which , contrary to @xmath0 , is gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the ope contributions of dimension 4 condensates were far more complicated @xcite than found previously @xcite : not only many kinds of condensates contributed to terms @xmath53 , but for many of them ( gauge - dependent gluon , ghost and mixed ones ) there has been no assignments of any kind of values yet .",
    "terms @xmath54 @xmath55 were not considered at all .",
    "thus , at this point , the only practical approach is that the contributions @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eqs .",
    "( [ kondoz ] ) and ( [ kondog ] ) are approximated by the terms @xmath53 and parametrized , i.e. , @xmath56 where both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are in principle free parameters to be fixed by phenomenology .",
    "still , we should mention that the effective gluon propagator advocated by lavelle @xcite would indicate @xmath59 for the following reason : for lg and @xmath33 , the contribution which this gluon propagator receives from the so - called `` pinch diagrams '' vanishes , and its @xcite @xmath50 contribution @xmath60 stems entirely from the gluon polarization function in ref .",
    "@xcite , provided one invokes some fairly plausible assumptions , like using equations of motion , to eliminate all condensates except @xmath61 .",
    "( the quark condensate @xmath62 could also be neglected @xcite . ) since ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the true value of @xmath63 is still rather uncertain , and since refs .",
    "@xcite make clear that lavelle s @xcite propagator misses some ( unknown ) three- and four - gluon contributions , we do not attach too much importance to the precise value @xmath64 @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ pilavelle91 ] ) , but just use it as an inspired initial estimate .",
    "fortunately , the corresponding variations of @xmath57 still permit good phenomenological fits , since we will find below that our results are not very sensitive to @xmath57 .",
    "there is no similar estimate for @xmath58 , but one may suppose that it would not differ from @xmath57 by orders of magnitude .",
    "we thus try @xmath65 as an initial guess .",
    "it will turn out , _ a posteriori _ , that this value of @xmath58 leads to a remarkably good fit to phenomenology .",
    "having set the stage , we are now ready to propose that @xmath66 leads to the enhancement of @xmath18 at intermediate @xmath41 . to derive the running coupling exhibiting this property ,",

    "admittedly , there is a caveat : while the _ ab initio _ ds studies @xcite do not have problems with reaching low momenta and in fact make strong statements about the asymptotic behavior in the @xmath106 limit , the lattice data @xcite do not reach very low momenta . the lowest data point for @xmath107 as well as @xmath108 in ref .",
    "@xcite is at @xmath109 gev@xmath2 , so that one must keep in mind that for lower @xmath41 , the corresponding lattice - data - fitting curves in figs .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows that the respective running couplings ( [ alkofalpha ] ) following from these  lattice \" @xcite and  _ ab initio _ ds \" @xcite renormalization functions typically do not differ by more than the factor of two .",

    "the examples @xcite of lattice results differing from the tbingen lattice @xcite and _ ab initio _ ds results @xcite are not only the relatively old ones such as those of suman and schilling on the ghost renormalization function ( which abruptly falls for the very smallest probed momenta , possibly indicating the infrared vanishing behavior ) @xcite , but also some of the most recent ones , such as ref .",

    "now , we want to make clear that we do not argue that our results are another indication that the running coupling indeed vanishes as @xmath106 , because we are aware ( as we comment in more detail below ) that the behavior of our running coupling at very small @xmath41 is just an artifact of the way eq .",
