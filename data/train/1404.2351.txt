    "reverberation mapping ( rm ) is a well - established technique for the study of broad - line regions ( blrs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with broad emission lines ( @xcite ) . with appropriate analysis ,",
    "rm experiments divulge the geometry , kinematic , and ionization structure information of blrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . over the past two decades , the blr size derived using the time delay between the continuum variation and the broad emission line response has been utilized with great success to measure the mass of the central supermassive black hole by combining it with the width of the broad emission line ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the tight relationship between blr sizes and optical luminosities of agns plays a key role in the demography of supermassive black holes in large agn surveys ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .    at present",
    "there are @xmath050 nearby seyfert galaxies and quasars with rm measurements in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although a huge amount of effort has been invested in rm experiments . in practice",
    ", an rm campaign is quite observationally intensive and requires monitoring an object over a sufficient period with reasonable temporal resolution .",
    "such high demand of time interval and sampling leads rm programs to be commonly undertaken by cooperative observations at multiple observatories , such as the well - known agn watch project ( @xcite ) and mdm campaigns ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectra calibration is most often based on the assumption that  @xmath15007 line remains constant in flux over the timescale of interest and all spectra are scaled to an adopted absolute flux of  @xmath15007 , which can be measured on photometric nights ( @xcite ) .",
    "the problem that arises with using  @xmath15007 for such a calibration is that its emission region ( narrow - line region ; nlr ) is sometimes spatially resolved and the size is most likely comparable with or even larger than the aperture size , in contrast to the effectively point - like blr and central continuum sources .",
    "consequently , the inhomogeneous aperture geometries used among different observation sets in a joint monitoring campaign admit different amounts of light from the nlr , and therefore introduce systematic deviations to the fluxes of broad emission lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , this effect also influences the central continuum fluxes contaminated by the host galaxy starlight .",
    "@xcite proposed an empirical correction to such an aperture effect by adopting one of the data set as standard , and applying a multiplicative scale factor and an additive flux adjustment to the other sets to bring the closely spaced measurements from the two sets into agreement . in reality , it is always impractical to base the correction on exactly contemporaneous observations .",
    "one has to relax such strict simultaneity and instead use pairs of observations that are closely separated ( usually by more than one days ) , depending on the sampling of each data set .",
    "this apparently degrades the highest achievable temporal resolution .    in this _ letter _ , we describe a novel method for intercalibration of reverberation mapping data that obviates the need for ( nearly ) contemporaneous observations , naturally incorporates physical models of flux variations , and fully takes into account the measurement errors .",
    "the method is based on bayesian statistics and is sufficiently elastic to automated program manipulation .",
    "while variability across all bandpasses is one of the outstanding characteristics of agns ( @xcite ) , its underlying mechanisms remain inconclusive .",
    "there are recent extensive studies on the nature of agn variability that are devoted to , but not limited to , exploring the ensemble properties of variability and its correlations with physical parameters of the agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; constructing the analytic stochastic description ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and testing / applying physically motivated models for variability ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that agn variability is plausibly linked to some hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities / turbulence within accretion disks , although such simulations are still in an early stage ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using well sampled optical light curves of agns , it has been found that the optical power spectral density ( psd ) of agn variability can be described by a power law @xmath2 with flattening to a constant below some break frequency that typically corresponds to a timescale of dozens of days ( @xcite ) .",
    "the slope @xmath3 of the optical psd seems to depend on the temporal frequency under consideration , changing from @xmath4 on a timescale of days ( @xcite ) , the normal temporal resolution of ground - based rm campaigns , to steeper values on much a shorter timescale , which , however , is based on a very preliminary analysis of the _ kepler _ data archive ( @xcite ) .",
    "these features motivate the statistical modeling of variability of agn optical continuum by a damped random walk ( drw ) process with great success ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is further reinforced by subsequent investigations of large samples of agn light curves ( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , a drw process is a stationary process such that its covariance function at any two times @xmath5 and @xmath6 depends only on the time difference @xmath7 and has the form of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the damping timescale of the process to return to its mean and @xmath10 is the standard deviation of variation on long timescales ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the corresponding psd is a lorentzian centered at zero @xmath12 since the optical variability of agns is well described by a drw process , it is expected that the variations of broad emission lines also follow drw processes but with separate sets of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , according to the principle of rm that broad emission line variations are blurred echoes of the continuum variation ( @xcite ) .",
    "apparently , there should be some correlations between the parameter sets of drw processes for the optical continuum and the broad emission lines .",
    "it worth stressing that the present method is not only restricted to the drw process .",
    "for more general cases , we make use of the fact that the covariance function and the psd are fourier duals of each other @xmath13 for any given agn variability modeled by either a psd or covariance function , we can thereby construct the bayesian posterior and perform intercalibration of the data sets as in next section .",
    "the measured data at hand are the flux time series of the continuum and broad emission lines that have been calibrated with the specified narrow emission line ( @xcite ) .",
    "intercalibration is required to correct the effect of inhomogeneous apertures . for illustration purposes ,",
    "we adopt the flux light curves of the broad h@xmath14 and 5100 continuum calibrated by  @xmath15 .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , after defining one data set for the target flux scale , the broad @xmath16 fluxes of the other data sets are corrected with respect to the target as @xmath17 and the continuum 5100  fluxes as @xmath18 where the subscript `` obs '' means the measured values , @xmath19 is a scalar for point - source correction , and @xmath20 is a flux offset for extended source correction ( e.g. , host galaxy starlight ) .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend on the individual data set .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the target set .",
    "we note that @xcite proposed using different means for the time series of each data set , which are quite trivial to obtain , to reconcile the different levels of the host galaxy contamination . here , the parameter @xmath20 is mathematically equivalent to their proposal in effect , but obviates extra steps for calculating the differences of the means required for intercalibration .",
    "we now develop a bayesian framework to perform intercalibration with the variation modeling described in the preceding section .",
    "we first derive the likelihood probability for the continuum fluxes .",
    "let the column vector @xmath23 denote the `` intrinsic '' continuum fluxes and @xmath24 denote the @xmath25 corresponding measurements subjected to aperture effect in a joint - monitoring campaign with @xmath26 data sets .",
    "the intrinsic light curve is deemed to be the sum of an underlying variation signal @xmath27 described by a drw process and a constant @xmath28 representing the mean of the light curve ( @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a vector with all unity elements . from equation  ( [ eqn_fcon ] ) and taking into account the measurement errors @xmath31 , @xmath24 is generated by @xmath23 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an @xmath34 diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are formed out of the @xmath26 multiplicative factors @xmath19 for @xmath26 data sets , @xmath35 is a vector of the @xmath26 additive factors @xmath20 , and @xmath36 is an @xmath37 matrix with entries of @xmath38 for @xmath39th data set .    as usual , we assume that both @xmath27 and @xmath31 are gaussian and uncorrelated . by following similar procedures in @xcite and @xcite based on the framework outlined by @xcite , we can trivially obtain the likelihood probability for @xmath24 as @xmath40d^m\\mathbi{s}_{\\rm c}d^m\\mathbi{n}_{\\rm c}dq_{\\rm c}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^t\\mathbi{n}_{\\rm c}\\boldsymbol{\\phi}| } } { \\sqrt{(2\\pi)^{m-1}|\\mathbi{c}_{\\rm c}||\\mathbi{n}_{\\rm c}||\\mathbi{e}^t\\mathbi{c}_{\\rm c}^{-1}\\mathbi{e}|}}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times &   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbi{y}}_{\\rm c}-\\mathbi{e}\\hat q_{\\rm c}\\right)^t\\mathbi{c}_{\\rm c}^{-1 } \\left(\\hat{\\mathbi{y}}_{\\rm c}-\\mathbi{e}\\hat q_{\\rm c}\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eqn_pcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] is the dirac function , the superscript `` @xmath42 '' represents the transposition , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the covariance matrix of the signal @xmath27 given by equation ( [ eqn_cov ] ) , and @xmath45 is the covariance matrix of the noise @xmath31 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is indeed the best estimate of @xmath28 . here",
    "the integral over @xmath28 marginalizes it and its prior probability @xmath48 is assumed to be constant . in equation ( [ eqn_pcd ] ) , the free parameters to be determined are the @xmath49 sets of @xmath50 for intercalibration , denoted by @xmath51 , and two parameters ( @xmath52 ) for the variation modeling of the continuum .    in a similar way , we can readily write out the likelihood probability @xmath53 of the emission line @xmath54 by replacing the subscript `` c '' with `` @xmath55 '' in above equations .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we treat the measurements of the continuum @xmath24 and emission line @xmath56 separately and assume that @xmath24 and @xmath56 are independent .",
    "as such , we can obtain a simple form of the posterior probability according to the bayes theorem : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the prior probability of the free parameters .",
    "maximizing equation ( [ eqn_post ] ) yields the best estimate of the free parameters .",
    "the uncertainties of the free parameters are determined from a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis and added in quadrature to flux intercalibration . equations ( [ eqn_fhb ] ) and ( [ eqn_fcon ] )",
    "are then applied for the final intercalibrated fluxes .",
    "we point out that since the posterior distribution is constructed over all the data sets , we can select any data set as the standard one , provided its measurements are sufficiently good to represent the genuine fluxes .",
    "compared with the previous empirical method proposed by @xcite , the superiority of the present bayesian method lies at ( 1 ) performing intercalibration on all the data sets simultaneously in equation ( [ eqn_post ] ) and therefore can make use of all the information in the data sets , ( 2 ) obviating the need for simultaneity of the data sets and relaxing the requirements for the sampling rates , ( 3 ) not degrading the highest achievable temporal resolution of the campaign , ( 4 ) capability of naturally incorporating physical models of variations and taking into account the measurement errors , and ( 5 ) sufficiently feasible for automated program manipulation regardless of samplings .",
    "we employ an mcmc analysis to explore the statistical properties of the free parameters .",
    "the samples of the free parameters are constructed from markov chains for the posterior probability distribution ( see equation ( [ eqn_post ] ) ) using parallel tempering and the metropolis - hastings algorithm ( @xcite ) . here , the parallel tempering algorithm guards the markov chain from being stuck in a local maximum and facilitates its convergence to globally optimized solutions .",
    "the prior probabilities in equation ( [ eqn_post ] ) are assigned as follows : for parameters whose typical values ranges are known , a uniform prior is assigned ; otherwise , if the parameter information is completely unknown , a logarithmic prior is assigned . among the free parameters , the priors for ( @xmath52 ) , ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath49 free parameters @xmath19 are set to be logarithmic , and the rest",
    "are set to be uniform .",
    "the markov chain is run for 150,000 steps in total .",
    "the best estimates for the parameters are taken to be the expectation value of their distribution and the uncertainties are taken to be the standard deviation .",
    "to demonstrate the fidelity of our new method , we apply it to the publicly accessible rm database of the seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 ( @xmath60 ) from the agn watch project ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 5548 was jointly monitored for as long as 13 yr between 1989 and 2001 by numerous ground - based optical telescopes , making it well suited for verifying our method . also , the original observed values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( i.e. , without calibration ) were published in the series of papers for ngc 5548 ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this allows us to directly compare the intercalibration results from our new method with those from the previous empirical method .",
    "we make use of the rm data from the first 2 yr ( 1989 and 1990 ) tabulated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the absolute flux of  @xmath15 for ngc 5548 is set to @xmath63}\\lambda5007)=5.58\\times10^{-13}\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ ] , as determined by @xcite .",
    "the observation noise values are assumed to be uncorrelated so that the covariance matrix @xmath64 in equation ( [ eqn_pcd ] ) is diagonal .      in the year 1989 , ngc 5548 was monitored by 17 telescopes with various individual apertures .",
    "@xcite grouped these measurements into 20 data sets according to the aperture sizes of the corresponding instruments ( see tables 6 - 8 therein ) .",
    "for the sake of clarity , in this work , we adopt the data set codes following @xcite to identify the instruments that obtained the spectrum .",
    "each data set is regarded to be internally homogeneous and the variations due to seeing are subsumed into the measurement uncertainties . @xcite selected the data set ( identified by code `` a '' ) with fairly numerous observations as the reference to gain a reasonable overlap with other data sets .",
    "they found that to improve the accuracy of the intercalibration , they needed to compare all the measurement pairs separated by up to 2 days .",
    "therefore , the temporal resolution of their light curves should be degraded to be at least larger than 2 days .",
    "indeed , the average interval between the measurements is 3.1 days and the median interval is 1 day ( see @xcite for details ) .    in figure  [ fig_year1991 ]",
    ", we compare the intercalibration results from our method with those from @xcite .",
    "the fractional measurement uncertainties for the continuum and the h@xmath14 fluxes are set uniformly to be 0.040 and 0.035 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find remarkable agreement of our results with those of @xcite , indicating the fidelity of our method .",
    "as mentioned above , our method does not degrade the temporal resolution ; however , the homogeneous _",
    "iue _ data of ngc 5548 showed evidence that the variability seems to begin to appear on a timescale longer than @xmath05 days ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is no surprise that the light curves of both the continuum and h@xmath14 fluxes are fairly consistent with @xcite s results .",
    "nevertheless , the measurement point of the continuum on hjd 2,447,546 that seems anomalously high in @xcite is now slightly lower in our results , as plotted in the top right panel of figure  [ fig_year1991 ] .      in the year 1990 , ngc 5548 was monitored by 12 telescopes and all the measurements are grouped into 12 data sets by @xcite ( see tables 5 - 7 therein ) .",
    "again , data set `` a '' was adopted as the reference .",
    "the short time scale sampling in this year is not sufficiently good as the year in 1989 .",
    "consequently , to obtain reliable intercalibration accuracy , @xcite adopted different time separations of the measurement pairs for comparison with different data sets .",
    "in particular , based on their method , it is impossible to intercalibrate data set `` k '' because none of its observations are within 5 days of any observations of the other sets .",
    "since the variation of ngc 5548 begins to be notable on a timescale of @xmath65 days , @xcite used the intercalibration constants for the set `` k '' in @xcite .",
    "however , an inspection of the intercalibration constants obtained in @xcite clearly shows that the constants are not exactly identical for the same set code .",
    "moreover , while the resulting fluxes of h@xmath14 of set `` k '' looks quite good , the fluxes of the continuum , highlighted with solid symbols in figure  [ fig_year1992 ] , are unexpectedly high ( the measurement hjd 2,448,120 in particular ) , implying that the intercalibration for set `` k '' is plausibly doubtful .",
    "we show our intercalibration results for the year 1990 in figure  [ fig_year1992 ] . again , except for set `` k '' , there is quite good agreement between the two methods .",
    "however , our intercalibrated fluxes of the continuum for set `` k '' seems much more reasonable and are consistent with the other closely spaced measurements regarding the variation trend .",
    "this is because our bayesian approach is not based on a comparison of the closely spaced measurements but instead looks for the most optimized solution for maximizing the posterior distribution in equation ( [ eqn_post ] ) .",
    "this permits us to cope with poorly sampled data as in set `` k '' .",
    "we propose a feasible bayesian method for spectral intercalibration in a joint monitoring campaign based on the assumption of flux constancy of some specified narrow emission line ( e.g. ,  @xmath15 ) . compared with the previous empirical method comparing the closely spaced measurement pairs ,",
    "our new method obviates the requirement for ( nearly ) contemporaneity of observations and takes into account the measurement errors naturally .",
    "the bayesian approach enables us to perform intercalibration on all the data sets simultaneously and self - consistently regardless of sampling rates , and therefore can cope with poorly sampled data .",
    "application to the rm database of ngc 5548 from the agn watch project shows the fidelity of our method and its capability to yield appropriate intercalibration where the previous method encountered difficulties .    in conclusion",
    "we propose a road map for complete spectral calibration in rm campaigns in which one or more emission lines with constant flux are present : first employ the algorithm described by @xcite to perform relative scaling based on the adopted emission line , which takes into account the zero - point wavelength - calibration errors between individual spectra and resolution differences ; and then employ our method to perform intercalibration to correct for the effect of inhomogeneous apertures .",
