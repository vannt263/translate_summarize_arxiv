    "this provides an in - plane spin component , which is necessary for the sge in ( 001)-grown qws .",
    "while the spin - based origin of the mpge was intensively discussed , most recently it was pointed out that orbital effects , caused by a magnetic - field - induced scattering asymmetry , may substantially contribute to the mpge  @xcite and thus complicate the analysis of the spin currents .",
    "the latter is of importance for the exploration of spin generation and spin - related transport in 2des , which are major and still growing fields in solid - state research .",

    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the initial and scattered electron wave vectors and @xmath58 is the vector composed of the pauli matrices .",
    "thus , the electron transitions to positive and negative @xmath59-states occur with different probabilities causing an imbalance in the distribution of carriers in both subbands between positive and negative @xmath60-states .",
    "this is shown by different thicknesses of the bent arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] . at zero magnetic ,",
    "field the asymmetry of the electron - phonon interaction would lead to a spin current , but not an electric current : this is due to the fact that the oppositely directed electron fluxes , @xmath61 , are of equal strength and therefore , compensate each other .",
    "the presence of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath24 , however , leads to the zeeman splitting of the @xmath62 subbands . as a consequence , the electron densities @xmath63 and @xmath64 in both spin subbands become different , and",

    "obviously , this current , classified as linear mpge , is spin - polarized and its value is proportional to the zeeman spin splitting induced by the magnetic field .",
    "its qw width dependence is described by the product @xmath66 .        in order to estimate the parameter @xmath67 caused by sia",
    ", we take into account that the remote impurities create an electric field @xmath68 along the growth direction , leading to the asymmetry of the qw .",

    "this leads to @xmath75 , and to the following dependence of this contribution to the linear mpge current : @xmath76 here we disregard a weak dependence of the scattering probability on the qw width .    in a set of samples with similar structure inversion asymmetry",
    ", like in our samples , where sia is controlled by the asymmetric doping , the mpge should vanish for the sample with zero @xmath0 factor and change its sign upon a qw width variation .",
    "thus , the spin - related mechanism of the mpge describes well the appearance of the sign inversion .",
    "however , it can not explain the fact that the mpge s sign inversion takes place for an about 4  nm broader qw than the inversion of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "@xcite the explanation of this fact requires an additional spin - independent orbital contribution to the mpge , recently addressed by tarasenko .",
    "@xcite        a process resulting in the orbital linear mpge is illustrated in fig .",

    "here , we consider the in - plane motion of carriers subjected to the high - frequency electric field ( e.g. , thz radiation ) applied along the @xmath26 direction and an in - plane magnetic field along the @xmath77 direction .",
    "for linearly polarized radiation , the electric field @xmath78 leads to a back and forth motion of electrons with velocity @xmath79 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] for two different times . without external field",
    "the electron s wave function is localized closer to one interface due to the asymmetrical doping , and its momentum relaxation rate @xmath80 has a contribution controlled by scattering by this interface .",
    "the orbital mpge originates from the combined action of electric and magnetic fields , described in the following .",
    "if @xmath78 is applied , at a certain time @xmath81 , the electron is accelerated by the in - plane @xmath82 electric field along the negative @xmath26 direction . at the same time , the electron with velocity @xmath83 is subjected to the magnetic field @xmath84 .",
    "this results in the lorentz force @xmath85 which shifts the wave function to the center of the quantum well and thus decreases the scattering probability ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] ) .",
    "half a period later , at @xmath86 , the electron velocity gets reversed so that the direction of the lorentz force reverses as well .",
    "now , the electron wave function is pushed closer to the interface , which increases the scattering rate and decreases the momentum relaxation .",
    "the resulting imbalance of the relaxation times for the motion along positive and negative @xmath26 direction causes a net electric current proportional to the magnetic field strength .",
    "obviously this mechanism yields a photocurrent , which does not change its sign with a variation of the qw width .",
    "microscopically , the orbital contribution to the linear mpge current @xmath87 is caused by the effect of a magnetic field on the scattering .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field results in a @xmath88-dependent mixing of the eigenstates @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and the envelope in the ground subband becomes @xmath91-dependent  @xcite @xmath92 this leads to the following contribution in the scattering probability @xmath93_z \\right\\},\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath94 is caused by sia .",

    "our above consideration shows , however , that the behavior of the photocurrent upon a variation of the qw width allows us to distinguish between these two basically different mechanisms .",
    "the observed sign inversion clearly demonstrates that the total current almost reflects the behavior of the @xmath0 factor and , therefore , is in most samples dominated by the spin mechanism .",
    "the small shift of the mpge s inversion point to a larger @xmath7 compared to the one of the @xmath0 factor , however , demonstrates that the orbital mpge also contributes and its magnitude is smaller but still comparable to that of the spin mpge . for a qw with @xmath7 of about 6.5  nm",

[ kerr ] .",
    "an optical method , which provides a non - equal population of an uniform distribution in both spin subbands was proposed in ref .  .",
    "this method , sketched in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is based on the optical excitation with circularly polarized light yielding a steady - state spin orientation @xmath129 in the growth direction .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field then rotates , due to the larmor precession , the optically oriented spins into the plane of the 2des . if @xmath130 is oriented along the @xmath26 axis we obtain a non - equilibrium spin polarization @xmath131 which reads after time averaging  @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the longitudinal and transverse electron spin relaxation times , the larmor frequency is given by @xmath135 , @xmath136 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath137 is the steady state electron spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field . according to eq .",
    "( [ equ22 ] ) the in - plane spin polarization @xmath131 causes a net electric current in the direction along the magnetic field . for the investigated qws at room temperature @xmath138 and ,",
    "therefore , the photocurrent is proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "the qw width dependence of @xmath126 is given by @xmath140 equation   shows that this contribution is proportional to the @xmath0 factor and , consequently , reflects its behavior upon a qw width variation .",
    "@xcite despite the qw width dependence of @xmath126 does not coincide with @xmath141 , this contribution to the photocurrent vanishes in qws with @xmath142 .",
    "the fact that in gaas / algaas qws the current , similarly to the @xmath0 factor , changes its sign upon a variation of @xmath7 qualitatively explains the mpge s sign inversion but can not clarify the difference in the two zero points . to explain this shift we should again address the possible contribution of the orbital mpge .",
    "an orbital mechanism yielding a helicity driven mpge current was recently suggested in ref .   and is given by @xmath143 the second rank pseudotensor @xmath144 has the same space symmetry properties as the pseudotensor @xmath145 , describing the spin - galvanic effect .",
    "however , the tensor @xmath144 is invariant under time inversion .",
    "microscopically , the orbital contribution to the circular mpge appears similarly to the one to the linear mpge current described above .",
    "the current is caused by the action of the lorentz force on the orbital motion of the 2d electrons in the radiation field .",
    "under irradiation with circularly polarized light electrons perform a cyclic motion and , due to sia , the presence of an in - plane magnetic field forces them to flow predominantly along the direction of @xmath130 .",
    "reversing the radiation s helicity , changes the current direction .",
    "the microscopic theory of this effect is given in ref .  .",
    "the resulting current @xmath146 , is caused by the @xmath130-dependent corrections to the scattering probability , eq .",
    ", as well as the corresponding contribution to the linear mpge .",
    "the photocurrents due to the circular and linear mpge are linked to each other according to @xmath147 at @xmath148 ( ref .  ) .",
    "using eq .  , we can , consequently , estimate the qw width dependence of @xmath149 as @xmath150 this equation shows that the orbital contribution to the circular mpge has a constant - sign dependence on the qw width .",
    "thus , the observed sign inversion of the circular mpge and the shift between its zero crossing and that of the @xmath0 factor agrees with the picture of the interplay of comparable spin and orbital contributions to this phenomenon",
    ".    both mechanisms of the circular mpge contribute to the total current @xmath151 and are described phenomenologically by similar equations .",
    "the observed sign inversion proves that , in correspondence with the results of the linear mpge , the dominant contribution comes from the spin - galvanic effect . while the spin - galvanic effect dominates the current for most of the investigated samples , the existence of the orbital circular mpge is also clearly demonstrated .",
    "in particular , for qws with a width of about 6.5  nm the spin - galvanic effect vanishes and the current is caused solely by the orbital circular mpge .",
    "to summarize , our experiments clearly demonstrate that , both , linear and circular mpge in gaas / algaas qw structures result from spin and orbital contributions .",
    "our experiments show that for most quantum well widths the mpge is mainly driven by spin - related mechanisms , which result in a photocurrent proportional to the @xmath0 factor . for structures with a vanishingly small @xmath0 factor , however , the mpge caused by orbital mechanisms is clearly observed .",
    "our work demonstrates that a variation of the electron @xmath0 factor by different means , like varying the qw width , as it is done here , doping with magnetic impurities or using narrow band materials , where @xmath0 and the spin - orbit interaction are enhanced , can be used for the separation of these qualitatively different mechanisms .",
    "moreover , the orbital mpge can be studied independently in materials with a vanishingly small spin - orbit interaction , like si - based metal - oxide - semiconductor low dimensional structures .",
