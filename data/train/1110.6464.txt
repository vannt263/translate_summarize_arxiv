    "the electroweak sector of the standard model has many extensions in the literature , several of them predicts the existence of a new neutral heavy spin one particle called z. direct searches for z boson are carried out at tevatron run ii and lhc @xcite , @xcite , and indirect searches will be explore by the next international lineal collider ( ilc ) . + in the present work we calculate the decay mode @xmath5 in the frame of the @xmath6 electroweak model @xcite .",
    "this model has the interesting feature that it does not contain the decay channel @xmath7 in opposition with many other extensions .",
    "+ in section , ii we describe the model representation , emphasizing the bosonic gauge lagrangian , as well as the scalar sector , necessary to give mass to particles by the higgs mechanism . + in section iii , we show the decay rate obtained for the @xmath5 , where the vertex was taken from the bosonic lagrangian developed in reference @xcite . + in section iv",
    ", we discuss the phenomenology for the z boson and contrast the rate decay found for this particle with the results of other models .",
    "+ in the appendix we show the total bosonic lagrangian after the symmetry breaking .",
    "we will focus primarily in the bosonic sector since we are interested in the @xmath0 decay , with vector bosons as final products . due to the @xmath6 electroweak symmetry , we obtain nine gauge bosons , eight spin - one particles are asssociated with the @xmath8 group , and the other one with the @xmath9 group . in this model",
    "the gauge bosons before the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) are determined by the algebra of the group generators .",
    "regardless of the matter representation chosen , these bosons are the same for the differents models @xcite",
    ".      we use the following triplet representation for the left - handed leptons@xcite : @xmath10 and singlets for the right - handed leptons : @xmath11 the charge assignation for each lepton family are determined by the gell - mann - nishijima relationship : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electric charge , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the gell - mann diagonal matrices , and @xmath16 the hypercharge .",
    "+ the difference with respect to the standard model arise in the incorporation on three new charge heavy leptons @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .      in this section",
    "we develop the bosonic sector from the @xmath8 local invariant yang - mills lagrangian type : @xmath20 the local gauge invariance requiere that the tensors takes the form : @xmath21 the structure constants @xmath22 , are determined by the gell - mann matrices algebra : @xmath23 \\lambda_{c}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand if we define the physics gauge bosons : @xmath24 it let us simplify our notation for the physics tensors : @xmath25 with this new notation the bosonic lagrangian takes the form : @xmath26 where the explicit development of this lagrangian in function of the physics fields is given in reference @xcite , and a list of the entire interaction lagrangian is shown in the appendix a.      with the purpose of generating mass to the particles we introduce three scalar triplets : @xmath27 @xmath28 where the charge assignation is governed by eq.([gell ] ) .",
    "the scalar local invariant lagrangian is written as : @xmath29 we choose the more general gauge invariant potential which contains the three scalar triplets @xcite : @xmath30 the vacuum expectation value for the neutral scalar components are : @xmath31 the covariant derivative must takes the form : @xmath32\\:\\varphi_{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "+ when we work the kinetic term fron the lagrangian given in eq.([laghiggs ] ) it is observed that the covariant derivative acting over the scalar fields let us to obtain the coupling between the gauge bosons and the scalars .",
    "the expansion about the vacuum state let identify the bosons mass when we contrast the resulting term from this lagrangian with the proca lagrangian .",
    "so , for the charged bosons we obtain : @xmath34 and for the neutral bosons we obtain the mass matrix : @xmath35 having obtained a non - diagonal matrix for the neutral fields is a signal that these fields are not the physical fields that are expected to find in nature , then to find them , it will be necessary diagonalize the mass matrix .",

    ", they consider a model with @xmath64 gauge symmetry too , but the change is in the scalar sector , where they introduce a sextet for the higgs fields in addition to the three triplets that we show in ( [ rep111 ] ) , and in the fermionic sector where they use antitriplets . + the decay rate shown in the work of ( ptvt ) is : @xmath65 where @xmath66,\\ \\ x \\equiv \\frac{4\\:m^{2}_{v}}{m^{2}_{z'}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by comparing this expression with that found in eq.([tasadeca11 ] ) , we observe that the difference lies in the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 so it seems interesting to show deviations between them , see fig 2 :     @xmath0 decay rate.,scaledwidth=50.0%,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
