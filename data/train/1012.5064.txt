    "this brief article is intended as an introduction to the study of chern - simons gauge theory via non - abelian localization @xcite .",
    "i will not attempt to give here a comprehensive overview of the subject . instead , my goal is to highlight two very beautiful ideas , one old and one new , which enter the story of non - abelian localization in an essential way and which may have applications elsewhere .",
    "see also @xcite for alternative approaches to path integral localization in chern - simons theory .    to set the stage",
    ", we consider chern - simons theory on a compact , oriented three - manifold @xmath0 with gauge group @xmath1 . by assumption @xmath1",
    "will be a compact , connected , simply - connected , and simple lie group .",
    "for instance , @xmath1 could be @xmath2 for any @xmath3 .",
    "these assumptions on @xmath1 ensure that any principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath4 over @xmath0 is topologically trivial , a technical convenience .",
    "the gauge field @xmath5 of chern - simons theory is then a connection on @xmath4 .",
    "let me now introduce the wilson loop operators in chern - simons theory .",
    "quite generally , a wilson loop operator @xmath6 in any gauge theory on a manifold @xmath0 is described by the data of an oriented , closed curve @xmath7 which is smoothly be smoothly embedded in @xmath0 is merely for convenience and is not strictly required to define @xmath6 as a sensible operator in gauge theory .",
    "indeed , the wilson loop expectation value in chern - simons theory can be computed exactly even for the case that @xmath7 is an arbitrary closed graph @xcite in @xmath0 . ]",
    "embedded in @xmath0 and which is decorated by an irreducible representation @xmath8 of the gauge group @xmath1 . as a classical functional of the connection @xmath5 , the wilson loop operator @xmath6",
    "is then given simply by the trace in @xmath8 of the holonomy of @xmath5 around @xmath7 , @xmath9 following the standard practice in physics , we describe the holonomy @xmath10 in the second line of in terms of a path - ordered exponential @xmath11 , which describes solutions to the first - order differential equation for parallel transport is the covariant derivative , a minus sign appears in the argument of the path - ordered exponential . ]",
    "along @xmath7 .    with the wilson loop operator in hand",
    ", we finally introduce the absolutely - normalized wilson loop path integral @xmath12}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the chern - simons action , @xmath14 and ` @xmath15 ' denotes a suitably - normalized , negative - definite , invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra @xmath16 of @xmath1 . for instance , if @xmath1 is @xmath2 , the quadratic form ` @xmath15 ' is given concretely by the trace in the fundamental @xmath17-dimensional representation of @xmath2 .",
    "for later use , let me recall three essential properties of the chern - simons action .",
    "first , the chern - simons action is purely topological , insofar as it depends only on the choice of an orientation , not a metric , on @xmath0 .",
    "second , the critical points of the chern - simons action are precisely the flat connections on @xmath0 , for which @xmath18 finally , even though the chern - simons action is not manifestly gauge - invariant and indeed the chern - simons action is _ not _ gauge - invariant  the chern - simons action is almost gauge - invariant , in the sense that it is invariant under homotopically trivial gauge transformations . under",
    "homotopically nontrivial gauge transformations , the functional @xmath13 shifts by integral multiples of @xmath19 , where the relevant integer is determined by the homotopy class of the gauge transformation as a map from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "so long as the chern - simons level @xmath20 is quantized to be an integer , the exponential of the chern - simons action in is then honestly gauge - invariant .    otherwise , we present @xmath21 as an integral over the infinite - dimensional affine space @xmath22 of connections on @xmath0 .",
    "as usual in gauge theory , we divide that integral by the volume of the infinite - dimensional group @xmath23 of gauge transformations acting on @xmath22 .    before proceeding ,",
    "let me make one elementary remark .",
    "when @xmath8 is the trivial representation , the wilson loop operator @xmath6 is the identity operator , and the absolutely - normalized wilson loop path integral reduces immediately to the path integral which describes the chern - simons partition function @xmath24 on @xmath0 , @xmath25}\\,.\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath21 , the wilson loop expectation value @xmath26 is then given by the ratio @xmath27 though the wilson loop expectation value is very convenient to consider for certain purposes , we work exclusively with @xmath28 today .",
    "as it stands , the wilson loop path integral in is a purely formal expression .",
    "nonetheless , over twenty years ago witten @xcite gave a completely precise prescription to define the observable @xmath21 , based upon the canonical quantization of chern - simons theory in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "this formalism leads to a well - known algebraic description @xcite of @xmath21 in terms of a presentation of @xmath0 via surgery on @xmath29 , combined with data about certain modular representations associated to two - dimensional rational conformal field theories .    beyond providing a rigorous means to define the observable @xmath30 ,",
    "the hamiltonian formalism is also very powerful , insofar as it can be used to perform explicit , exact calculations in chern - simons theory .",
    "for instance , among the classic results in @xcite , witten computed the unknot observable @xmath31 for chern - simons theory on @xmath29 with gauge group @xmath32 , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the irreducible representation of @xmath32 with dimension @xmath35 , and as indicated , @xmath34 runs without loss over the finite set of representations which are integrable in the affine lie algebra for @xmath32 at level @xmath36 .    yet despite its computability , the algebraic definition of @xmath21 in the hamiltonian formalism obscures many features which are manifest in the preceding path integral and which one would like to understand more deeply . as a simple example , in the semi - classical limit that @xmath36 is large , a naive stationary - phase approximation can be applied to the path integral describing the chern - simons partition function , and this approximation implies asymptotic behavior for @xmath24 that is far from evident in the complicated , exact expressions that arise from conformal field theory .",
    "nonetheless , the predicted asymptotic behavior can be checked in examples , as was done early on by freed and gompf @xcite , jeffrey @xcite , and garoufalidis @xcite .",
    "see for instance  7 of @xcite for a survey of continuing work in this area .",
    "this article concerns a very special and very beautiful situation in which the stationary - phase approximation to the wilson loop path integral is actually exact .",
    "namely , the three - manifold @xmath0 is a seifert manifold , equipped with a distinguished locally - free @xmath37 action , and the curve @xmath7 is a seifert fiber of @xmath0 . by definition ,",
    "a locally - free @xmath37 action is one for which the generating vector field is nowhere vanishing .",
    "equivalently , all stabilizers under a locally - free @xmath37 action are proper , necessarily discrete , subgroups of @xmath37 .",
    "let me introduce a bit of terminology .",
    "the existence of a locally - free @xmath37 action implies that the seifert manifold @xmath0 decomposes geometrically as the total space of a nontrivial circle bundle over a riemann surface @xmath38 , @xmath39 here @xmath38 is allowed to have orbifold points , and the circle bundle is allowed to be a corresponding orbifold bundle , so long as @xmath0 itself is smooth .",
    "each seifert manifold carries a distinguished set of wilson loop operators which respect the @xmath37 action by rotations in the fiber of . for these wilson loops ,",
    "the curve @xmath7 is an orbit of the given @xmath37 action , and @xmath7 appears geometrically in @xmath0 as the @xmath40 fiber over a basepoint @xmath41 . assuming that @xmath42 is a smooth ( non - orbifold ) point of @xmath38 ,",
    "the topology of @xmath7 in @xmath0 does not depend upon the choice of @xmath42 , so such wilson loops are determined entirely by the choice of the representation @xmath8 .",
    "henceforth , we refer to these special wilson loop operators which wrap the generic seifert fibers of @xmath0 as `` seifert loop operators '' to distinguish them from general wilson loops in @xmath0 , about which we will also have some things to say .    as a concrete example",
    ", @xmath29 admits countably - many locally - free @xmath37 actions , each associated to a distinct seifert presentation .",
    "according to a basic result of moser @xcite , the corresponding knots which can be realized as seifert fibers in @xmath29 are precisely the torus knots .",
    "so the seifert loop operators in @xmath29 are just the wilson loop operators which wrap torus knots .",
    "the exactness of the stationary - phase approximation to the seifert loop path integral was discovered by lawrence and rozansky @xcite on an empirical basis , through a detailed analysis of the explicitly - known formulae for @xmath21 in the case @xmath43 .. ] specifically , after a rather involved series of algebraic manipulations , lawrence and rozansky were able to rewrite @xmath21 very compactly as a finite sum of analytic expressions , each being either a contour integral or the residue of a meromorphic function .",
    "these summands in @xmath21 could then be associated in a one - to - one fashion with the connected components in the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath0 .",
    "since the flat connections on @xmath0 are the critical points of the chern - simons action , such a form for @xmath28 strongly suggests that the stationary - phase approximation to the seifert loop path integral is exact .    by way of illustration ,",
    "lawrence and rozansky would rewrite the exact formula for the unknot observable @xmath31 in as @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the character of @xmath32 associated to the representation @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the equality between the expressions in and follows by evaluating as a sum of elementary gaussian integrals .",
    "of course , the only flat connection on @xmath29 is the trivial connection . as a result ,",
    "the aforementioned sum in @xmath48 contains only a single term , given by the integral over the real variable @xmath49 in . according to lawrence and rozansky ,",
    "this integral is to be interpreted as the stationary - phase contribution from the trivial connection to the full wilson loop path integral in .",
    "one of the main results in @xcite is to make the semi - classical interpretation of formulae such as completely precise .",
    "briefly , the contour integral over @xmath49 arises geometrically as an integral over the cartan subalgebra of @xmath32 , regarded as the group of constant gauge transformations on @xmath29 .",
    "the constant gauge transformations are the stabilizer of the trivial connection in the group @xmath23 of all gauge transformations , and the presence of this stabilizer group plays an important role in the semi - classical analysis of the wilson loop path integral .",
    "moreover , all dependence on the @xmath32 representation @xmath46 enters the integrand of through the character @xmath45 . as a result",
    ", the character @xmath45 can be naturally interpreted the avatar of the unknot wilson loop operator itself when the path integral in is reduced to the contour integral in .    as an aside , let me mention two interesting generalizations of the semi - classical formula for @xmath50 in .",
    "first , this formula extends directly to gauge groups @xmath1 other than @xmath32 , in which case the unknot wilson loop operator for any irreducible representation @xmath8 of @xmath1 reduces naturally to the corresponding character @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the semi - classical formula in generalizes in a surprisingly simple way to the arbitrary @xmath52-torus knot @xmath53 in @xmath29 , @xmath54 } \\,\\times\\,\\\\ & \\times \\ , \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\ ! dx \\ ; \\ch_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\boldmath$j$}}\\!\\left(\\e{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}}{\\frac{x}{2}}\\right ) \\sinh{\\!\\left(\\e{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}}\\frac{x}{2 { \\bf p}}\\right ) } \\sinh{\\!\\left(\\e{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}}\\frac{x}{2 { \\bf q}}\\right ) } \\exp{\\!\\left[-{\\frac{(k+2)}{8\\pi } } \\left(\\frac{x^2}{{\\bf p}{\\bf q}}\\right)\\right]}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] modulo a rather subtle overall phase , the integrand in merely acquires denominators proportional to @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from the semi - classical perspective",
    ", these denominators are associated to the @xmath37 stabilizers of the exceptional seifert fibers in @xmath29 .",
    "i refer the interested reader to ",
    "@xmath57 in @xcite for a detailed discussion of .",
    "my goal here is to explain a second , more conceptual way to understand the exactness of the stationary - phase approximation to the seifert loop path integral . in this approach",
    ", we apply non - abelian localization , as introduced by witten in @xcite , to study chern - simons theory on a seifert manifold .",
    "very briefly , non - abelian localization provides a cohomological interpretation for a special class of symplectic integrals which are intimately related to symmetries .",
    "these integrals take the canonical form @xmath58}.\\ ] ] here @xmath59 is an arbitrary symplectic manifold with symplectic form @xmath60 .",
    "we assume that a lie group @xmath61 acts on @xmath59 in a hamiltonian fashion with moment map @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dual of the lie algebra @xmath64 of @xmath61 .",
    "we also introduce an invariant quadratic form @xmath65 on @xmath64 and dually on @xmath63 to define the function @xmath66 appearing in the integrand of @xmath67 .",
    "finally , @xmath68 is a coupling parameter . in",
    ", we expand the exponential @xmath69 in its taylor series and pick out the term @xmath70 of proper degree to integrate over @xmath59 .",
    "hence @xmath69 conveniently describes the symplectic measure on @xmath59 . ]",
    "the symplectic integral in has a number of important properties , which for sake of brevity i merely state .",
    "see @xcite for proofs of the following statements .",
    "first , the integrand of admits an interpretation in terms of the @xmath61-equivariant cohomology ring of @xmath59 . using this interpretation , one can then show that the symplectic integral itself localizes onto the critical points of the invariant function @xmath66 on @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , a non - abelian localization formula , roughly analogous to the duistermaat - heckman formula @xcite , exists to describe the contributions from the critical locus of @xmath71 . in a smooth situation ,",
    "these contributions are given by the integrals of certain de rham cohomology classes over the critical loci .",
    "@xmath72 of @xcite for a precise statement of the non - abelian localization formula applicable to chern - simons theory .",
    "given the special form of @xmath67 , one should not be surprised that this integral has special properties .",
    "but why consider such an integral in the first place ?",
    "one answer , following witten @xcite , is that the path integral of two - dimensional yang - mills theory assumes precisely the canonical symplectic form in .    to explain the latter observation",
    ", i will simply exhibit the counterparts of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath73 relevant to describe yang - mills theory on a riemann surface @xmath38 .",
    "the yang - mills path integral is formally an integral over the affine space @xmath22 of connections on a fixed principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath4 over @xmath38 , so clearly we must set @xmath74 the affine space @xmath22 also possesses a natural symplectic form @xmath60 given by the intersection pairing on @xmath38 , @xmath75 here @xmath76 denotes the exterior derivative acting on @xmath22 . since @xmath5 serves as a coordinate on @xmath22 , @xmath77 is a one - form on @xmath22 , and @xmath60 is a two - form on @xmath22 which is manifestly non - degenerate and closed .",
    "of course on @xmath38 itself , @xmath77 transforms as a section of the bundle @xmath78 of adjoint - valued one - forms .",
    "the obvious group which acts on @xmath22 is the group @xmath23 of gauge transformations .",
    "as shown long ago by atiyah and bott @xcite , the action of @xmath23 on @xmath22 is hamiltonian with moment map given by the curvature @xmath79 .",
    "that is , since elements in the lie algebra of @xmath23 appear on @xmath38 as sections of the adjoint bundle @xmath80 , the curvature @xmath81 , as a section of @xmath82 , can naturally be considered as a function on @xmath22 taking values in the dual of the lie algebra of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , @xmath83    finally , the lie algebra of @xmath23 admits an invariant form given by @xmath84 here @xmath85 is an element of the lie algebra of @xmath23 , transforming on @xmath38 as a section of @xmath80 . with the quadratic form in",
    ", the invariant function @xmath86 appearing in the canonical symplectic integral over @xmath22 immediately becomes the yang - mills action , @xmath87    the metric on @xmath88 in is defined using a duality operator @xmath89 on @xmath38 . for two - dimensional yang - mills theory , @xmath89 relates zero - forms to two - forms , and to obtain such an operator , we only require a symplectic structure , as opposed to a metric , on @xmath38 .",
    "given a symplectic form @xmath90 on @xmath38 , we define @xmath89 by the condition @xmath91 .",
    "the symplectic form @xmath90 is invariant under all area - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath38 , and this large group acts as a symmetry of two - dimensional yang - mills theory . as a result , two - dimensional yang - mills theory is essentially a topological gauge theory .    in the remainder of this article ,",
    "i want to explain how to recast the seifert loop path integral as a symplectic integral of the canonical form .",
    "once this step is accomplished , the general arguments in @xcite imply that the seifert loop path integral localizes onto critical points of the classical action @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , using the non - abelian localization formula , one can perform exact computations of the seifert loop path integral and thus obtain a cohomological description for the seifert loop operator itself . specifically , as demonstrated in ",
    "@xmath93 of @xcite , the seifert loop operator reduces naturally to the chern character of an associated universal bundle over the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath0 .",
    "two key ideas are required to obtain a symplectic description of the seifert loop path integral .",
    "the first idea , which appears in  @xmath94 of @xcite , pertains to the basic chern - simons path integral in and really has nothing to do with the wilson loop operator .",
    "in contrast , the second idea concerns the wilson loop operator itself and really has nothing to do with chern - simons theory . nonetheless , both of these ideas fit together in a very elegant way .",
    "the path integral which describes the partition function of two - dimensional yang - mills theory automatically assumes the canonical symplectic form in . as a special case of our general study of @xmath28 ,",
    "i now want to review how the path integral which describes the partition function @xmath24 of chern - simons theory on a seifert manifold @xmath0 can also be cast as such a symplectic integral .    in order to obtain a symplectic interpretation of the two - dimensional yang - mills path integral , we found it necessary to introduce a symplectic structure on @xmath38 . to obtain a corresponding symplectic interpretation for the chern - simons path integral",
    ", we must introduce the analogous geometric structure on the three - manifold @xmath0  namely , a contact structure .",
    "globally , a contact structure on @xmath0 is described by an ordinary one - form @xmath95 , a section of @xmath96 , which at each point of @xmath0 satisfies the contact condition @xmath97 by a classic theorem of martinet @xcite , any compact , orientable defines an orientation . ]",
    "three - manifold admits a contact structure , so we do not necessarily assume @xmath0 to be seifert at this stage .",
    "however , if @xmath0 is a seifert manifold , then we certainly want the contact form @xmath95 to respect the @xmath37 action on @xmath0 .",
    "such a contact form can be exhibited as follows .",
    "we recall that the seifert manifold @xmath0 is the total space of an @xmath40-bundle of degree @xmath98 over @xmath38 , @xmath99 or an orbifold version thereof . for simplicity ,",
    "i will phrase the following construction of @xmath95 in the language of smooth manifolds , but the orbifold generalization is immediate .",
    "regarding @xmath0 as the total space of a principal @xmath37-bundle , we take @xmath95 to be a @xmath37-connection on this bundle which satisfies @xmath100 here @xmath90 is any unit - area symplectic form on @xmath38 , and we recall that a @xmath37-connection on @xmath38 appears upstairs on @xmath0 as an ordinary one - form . because @xmath101 represents the euler class of the @xmath40-bundle over @xmath38 , the degree @xmath98 necessarily appears in . as an abelian connection ,",
    "@xmath95 is automatically invariant under the @xmath37-action on @xmath0 . also , since the pullback of @xmath95 to each @xmath40 fiber is non - vanishing , the contact condition in is satisfied so long as @xmath102 and the bundle is non - trivial , as we assume .",
    "chern - simons theory is often considered to be an intrinsically three - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "however , one of the more interesting results in @xcite is to show that chern - simons theory is _ not quite _ a three - dimensional gauge theory , since one of the three components of @xmath5 can be completely decoupled from all topological observables .    in order to decouple one component of @xmath5 from the chern - simons path integral",
    ", we introduce a new , infinite - dimensional `` shift '' symmetry @xmath103 which acts on @xmath5 as @xmath104 here @xmath42 is an arbitrary adjoint - valued scalar , a section of @xmath105 , that parametrizes the action of @xmath103 on @xmath22 .    of course , the chern - simons action @xmath106 does not respect the shift of @xmath5 in , so we must play a little path integral trick , of the sort familiar from path integral derivations of @xmath107-duality or abelian @xmath71-duality . see  @xmath108 in @xcite for a nice review of the path integral derivations of these dualities .",
    "we first introduce a new field @xmath109 which transforms like @xmath42 as an adjoint - valued scalar , a section of @xmath110 , and which is completely gauge - trivial under @xmath103 .",
    "thus @xmath103 acts on @xmath109 as @xmath111    next , we consider a new , shift - invariant action @xmath112 incorporating both @xmath5 and @xmath109 such that , if @xmath109 is set identically to zero via , then @xmath112 reduces to the chern - simons action for @xmath5 .",
    "this condition fixes @xmath112 to be @xmath113\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , using we introduce an _ a priori _ new path integral of @xcite for a detailed accounting of formal normalization factors . ] over both @xmath5 and @xmath109 , @xmath114}\\,.\\ ] ] on one hand , if we set @xmath115 using the shift - symmetry in , @xmath116 immediately reduces for @xmath103 is trivial . ] to the usual chern - simons partition function @xmath24 .",
    "hence , @xmath117    on the other hand , due to the elementary fact that @xmath118 , the field @xmath109 appears only quadratically in @xmath119 .",
    "so we can simply perform the gaussian integral over @xmath109 in to obtain a new path integral description of the chern - simons partition function , @xmath120}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath121\\,.\\ ] ] in performing the gaussian integral over @xmath109 , we use the contact condition on @xmath95 in , since this condition ensures that quadratic term for @xmath109 in is everywhere non - degenerate on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the inverse `` @xmath122 '' appearing in is defined as follows . because @xmath123 is everywhere non - vanishing ,",
    "we can always write @xmath124 for some section @xmath125 of @xmath126 . thus , we set @xmath127 , and the second term in @xmath128 becomes @xmath129 .    by construction , @xmath128 is invariant under the shift of @xmath5 in , as can be checked directly .",
    "thus , we have obtained a new description of the chern - simons partition function for which one component of @xmath5 completely decouples from the path integral .",
    "further , we have yet to use the condition that @xmath0 be a seifert manifold , so the reformulation of @xmath24 via the shift - invariant action in holds for any three - manifold @xmath0 endowed with a contact structure .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed analysis of the shift - invariant reformulation of @xmath24 in the special case that the gauge group is @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a seifert manifold , an additional miracle occurs , and the path integral in becomes an integral of the canonical symplectic form to which non - abelian localization applies . for sake of time , let me merely summarize the symplectic data associated to .",
    "first , the space over which we integrate in and which must play the role of @xmath59 is the quotient of the affine space @xmath22 by the group @xmath103 , @xmath130 in three dimensions , the affine space @xmath22 is not symplectic .",
    "however , once we take the quotient by @xmath103 in , the space @xmath131 carries a natural symplectic form @xmath60 given by @xmath132 clearly @xmath60 is both gauge - invariant and shift - invariant , and @xmath60 descends to a non - degenerate symplectic form on @xmath131 .",
    "we must now find a hamiltonian group acting on @xmath131 such that the shift - invariant action @xmath128 is the square of the corresponding moment map . as an initial guess , motivated by the example of two - dimensional yang - mills theory , one might consider the group @xmath23 of gauge transformations .",
    "however , this guess can not be correct . by construction , the square of the moment map for the action of @xmath23 on @xmath131 would be invariant under @xmath23 .",
    "however , @xmath128 is plainly not invariant under @xmath23 , since the chern - simons term appearing in is not invariant under the large gauge transformations in @xmath23 ( while the remaining term in is manifestly invariant under @xmath23 ) .    as a second guess",
    ", one might replace @xmath23 with its identity component @xmath133 , which does preserve the shift - invariant action @xmath128 .",
    "however , one can show that @xmath133 is obstructed from acting in a hamiltonian fashion on @xmath131 by a non - trivial lie algebra cocycle @xmath134 , @xmath135 here @xmath85 and @xmath136 are elements of the lie algebra of @xmath133 , transforming as sections of @xmath137 on @xmath0 .",
    "parenthetically , this cocycle is closely related to a cocycle that appears in the theory of loop groups @xcite , which also provides useful background for the identification of @xmath61 below .",
    "to remedy the situation , we consider the central extension @xmath138 of @xmath133 determined by @xmath139 , @xmath140 here we use the subscript ` @xmath141 ' to emphasize that @xmath142 is central in @xmath143 .",
    "the natural action of @xmath133 on @xmath131 extends to an action by @xmath143 , for which @xmath142 acts trivially . by construction ,",
    "the action of @xmath143 on @xmath131 is then hamiltonian .",
    "however , @xmath143 is still not the group which is to play the role of the hamiltonian group @xmath61 ! in order to define the canonical symplectic integral in , the lie algebra of @xmath61 must carry a non - degenerate , invariant quadratic form @xmath65 .",
    "but the lie algebra of @xmath143 does not admit such a form , essentially because we have no generator to pair with the generator of the central @xmath142 .",
    "however , we have also yet to apply the seifert condition on @xmath0 .",
    "we do so now . to avoid confusion ,",

    "the presentation here is a regrettably quick sketch of a fairly miraculous result , and i refer the reader to",
    " @xmath94 of @xcite for a complete discussion .",
    "i now want to explain how the prior statements concerning the chern - simons partition function can be generalized to allow for insertions of wilson loop operators .",
    "( see  @xmath147 of @xcite for an expanded version of the material here . )",
    "as it happens , only one new idea is required .",
    "we clearly need a new idea , because a naive attempt to reapply the previous path integral manipulations to the wilson loop path integral in runs immediately aground . to illustrate the difficulty with the direct approach , let us consider the obvious way to rewrite the wilson loop path integral in a shift - invariant form , @xmath148}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath149 denotes the generalized wilson loop operator defined not using @xmath5 but using the shift - invariant combination @xmath150 , so that @xmath151}\\,.\\ ] ] exactly as for our discussion of , we can use the shift symmetry to fix @xmath115 , after which the path integral in reduces trivially to the standard wilson loop path integral in .",
    "however , to learn something useful from we must perform the path integral over @xmath109 , and as it stands , this integral is not easy to do .",
    "because the generalized wilson loop operator @xmath149 is expressed in as a complicated , non - local functional of @xmath109 , the path integral over @xmath109 in is not a gaussian integral that we can trivially evaluate as we did for .",
    "a more fundamental perspective on our problem is the following .",
    "let us return to the description of the ordinary wilson loop operator @xmath6 as the trace in the representation @xmath8 of the holonomy of @xmath5 around @xmath7 , @xmath152 as observed by witten in one of the small gems of @xcite , this description of @xmath6 should be regarded as intrinsically quantum mechanical , for the simple reason that @xmath6 can be naturally interpreted in as the partition function of an auxiliary quantum system attached to the curve @xmath7 .",
    "briefly , the representation @xmath8 is to be identified with the hilbert space of this system , the holonomy of @xmath5 is to be identified with the time - evolution operator around @xmath7 , and the trace over @xmath8 is the usual trace over the hilbert space that defines the partition function in the hamiltonian formalism .    because the notion of tracing over a hilbert space is inherently quantum mechanical , any attempts to perform essentially classical path integral manipulations involving the expressions in or are misguided at best .",
    "rather , if we hope to generalize the semi - classical path integral manipulations which we used to study the chern - simons partition function , we need to use an alternative , semi - classical description for the wilson loop operator itself .",
    "more precisely , we want to replace the quantum mechanical trace over @xmath8 in by a path integral over an auxiliary bosonic field @xmath153 which is attached to the curve @xmath7 and coupled to the connection @xmath5 as a background field , so that schematically @xmath154}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath155 is an action , depending upon the representation @xmath8 through its highest weight @xmath156 , which is a local , gauge - invariant , and indeed topological functional of the defect field @xmath153 and the restriction of @xmath5 to @xmath7 .",
    "not surprisingly , this semi - classical description of @xmath6 turns out to be the key ingredient required to reformulate the wilson loop path integral in a shift - invariant fashion .",
    "the idea of representing the wilson loop operator by a path integral as in is a very old and very general piece of gauge theory lore . in the context of four - dimensional yang - mills theory",
    ", this idea goes back ( at least ) to work of balachandran , borchardt , and stern @xcite in the 1970 s .",
    "see also @xcite and  @xmath157 in @xcite for other appearances of the path integral in .",
    "the basic idea behind the path integral description of the wilson loop operator is very simple .",
    "we interpret the closed curve @xmath7 as a periodic `` time '' for the field @xmath153 , and we apply the hamiltonian formalism to rewrite the path integral over @xmath153 axiomatically as the quantum mechanical trace of the corresponding time - evolution operator around @xmath7 , @xmath158 here @xmath159 is the hilbert space obtained by quantizing @xmath153 , and @xmath160 is the hamiltonian which acts on @xmath159 to generate infinitesimal translations along @xmath7 .    comparing the conventional description of the wilson loop operator in to the axiomatic expression in , we see that the two agree if we identify is a hermitian operator , accounting for the ` @xmath161 ' in .",
    "we also recall that the gauge field @xmath5 is valued in the lie algebra @xmath16 , so @xmath5 is anti - hermitian and no ` @xmath162 ' appears in the holonomy . ]",
    "@xmath163 hence to make the wilson loop path integral in precise , we need only exhibit a classical theory on @xmath7 , for which the gauge group @xmath1 acts as a symmetry , such that upon quantization we obtain a hilbert space @xmath159 isomorphic to @xmath8 and for which the time - evolution operator around @xmath7 is given by the holonomy of @xmath5 , acting as an element of @xmath1 on @xmath8 .",
    "let me now tell you what classical theory to place on @xmath7 to realize the quantum identifications in .    of the two identifications in , the more fundamental by far is the identification of the irreducible representation @xmath8 with a hilbert space @xmath159 , obtained by quantizing some classical phase space upon which @xmath1 acts as a symmetry .",
    "so before we even consider what classical theory must live on @xmath7 to describe the wilson loop operator , we can ask the simpler and more basic question  what classical phase space must we quantize to obtain @xmath8 as a hilbert space ?    as well - known , this question is beautifully answered by the borel - weil - bott theorem @xcite . in order to recall this theorem , let me first fix a maximal torus @xmath164 , for which @xmath165 is the associated cartan subalgebra .",
    "given the irreducible representation @xmath8 and some choice of positive roots for @xmath1 , i also introduce the associated highest weight @xmath156 .",
    "canonically , the weight @xmath156 lies in the dual @xmath166 of @xmath167 , but given the invariant form ` @xmath15 ' on @xmath16 , we are free to identify @xmath168 and hence to regard @xmath156 as an element of @xmath167 , @xmath169 though mathematically unnatural , the convention in proves to be convenient later .",
    "the borel - weil - bott theorem concerns the geometry of the orbit @xmath170 which passes through @xmath156 under the adjoint action of @xmath1 .",

    "for instance , if @xmath43 and @xmath156 is any non - zero , then @xmath171 is merely a point . ]",
    "weight , then @xmath175 can be identified as @xmath176 endowed with the round , fubini - study metric .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the borel - weil - bott theorem states that the irreducible representation @xmath8 can be realized geometrically as the space of holomorphic sections of a certain unitary line bundle @xmath177 over @xmath171 .",
    "that is , @xmath178 where the action of @xmath1 on the sections of @xmath177 is induced from its action on @xmath171 .    as a unitary line bundle over a khler manifold",
    ", @xmath177 carries a natural unitary connection @xmath179 which is also invariant under @xmath1 .",
    "the connection @xmath179 enters the path integral description of the wilson loop operator , so let me exhibit it explicitly .",
    "when pulled back to @xmath1 , the line bundle @xmath177 trivializes , and the connection @xmath179 appears as the following left - invariant one - form on @xmath1 , @xmath180 i have introduced the connection @xmath179 because its curvature @xmath181 is precisely the khler form on @xmath171 . as a result",
    ", @xmath177 is a prequantum line bundle over @xmath171 , and the borel - weil - bott isomorphism in identifies @xmath8 as the hilbert space obtained by khler quantization of @xmath171 .",
    "perhaps more physically , the borel - weil - bott theorem can be interpreted as identifying the space of groundstates for a charged particle moving on @xmath171 in the presence of a background magnetic field given by @xmath182 . briefly , because of the non - zero magnetic field , the wavefunctions which describe this particle transform on @xmath171 not as functions but as sections of the line bundle @xmath177 . as standard ,",
    "the hamiltonian which describes free propagation on @xmath171 is proportional to the laplacian @xmath183 acting on sections of @xmath177 , and by hodge theory , the kernel of @xmath183 can be identified as the space of holomorphic sections of @xmath177 .",
    "hence the role of is to realize the representation @xmath8 in terms of groundstates on @xmath171 .    given the previous quantum mechanical interpretation for @xmath8 , the corresponding path integral description for the wilson loop operator follows immediately . ignoring the coupling to @xmath5 for a moment ,",
    "if we simply wish to describe the low - energy effective dynamics of an electron moving on @xmath171 in the background magnetic field @xmath182 , we consider a one - dimensional sigma model of maps @xmath184 with sigma model action @xmath185 here @xmath186 denotes the pullback of @xmath179 to a connection over @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath153 is lifted as a map to @xmath187 by a corresponding map @xmath188 then the pullback of @xmath179 appears explicitly as in . as a word of warning",
    ", i will freely switch between writing formulae in terms of @xmath153 or @xmath189 as convenient .    from a physical perspective",
    ", the first - order action @xmath190 simply describes the minimal coupling of the charged particle on @xmath171 to the background magnetic field specified by @xmath179 , and we have omitted the second - order kinetic terms for @xmath153 as being irrelevant at low energies . from a more geometric perspective , @xmath190 is a one - dimensional chern - simons action for the abelian connection @xmath186 over @xmath7 . as such , the quantization of the parameter @xmath191 as a weight of @xmath1 follows just as for the quantization of the chern - simons level @xmath36 .",
    "more physically , the quantization of @xmath156 follows from the quantization of magnetic flux on a compact space .",
    "this sigma model on @xmath7 clearly respects the action of @xmath1 on @xmath171 as a global symmetry . to couple the sigma model to the restriction of the bulk gauge field @xmath5",
    ", we simply promote the global action of @xmath1 on @xmath171 to a gauge symmetry .",
    "that is , we consider the covariant version of , @xmath192 in the second line , we indicate the action of the covariant derivative @xmath193 on @xmath189 .",
    "the action by @xmath193 on @xmath189 descends to a corresponding covariant action by @xmath193 on @xmath153 as well .",
    "i now claim that the quantization of the gauged sigma model on @xmath7 with action @xmath194 leads to the identifications in required to describe the wilson loop operator .",
    "first , the classical equation of motion for @xmath153 simply asserts that @xmath153 is covariantly constant , @xmath195 as a result , the classical phase space for @xmath153 can be identified with the orbit @xmath171 , and by the borel - weil - bott isomorphism in , the corresponding hilbert space @xmath159 for @xmath153 is identified as the representation @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , since the classical time - evolution for @xmath153 is given by parallel transport , the quantum time - evolution operator around @xmath7 is immediately given by the holonomy of @xmath5 , acting as an element of @xmath1 on @xmath8 .    because @xmath5 only enters as a background field in",
    ", the path integral description of @xmath6 is completely general and applies to any gauge theory in any dimension .",
    "nonetheless , this description of the wilson loop operator is precisely what we need to obtain a shift - invariant formulation of the wilson loop path integral in chern - simons theory .",
    "let us first apply to rewrite the wilson loop path integral in as a path integral over both @xmath5 and @xmath153 , @xmath196}\\,.\\ ] ] here we introduce the free loopspace @xmath197 of @xmath171 to parametrize configurations of @xmath153 .",
    "once we introduce the defect field @xmath153 coupling to @xmath5 in , the classical equation of motion for @xmath5 becomes @xmath198 here @xmath199 is a two - form with delta - function support on @xmath7 which represents the poincar dual of the curve . using @xmath199 , we rewrite @xmath200 as a bulk integral over @xmath0 , @xmath201 from which follows .    as we see from , in the presence of the operator @xmath6 , classical configurations for @xmath5",
    "are given by connections which are flat on the knot complement @xmath202 and otherwise have delta - function curvature along @xmath7 .",
    "the singularity in @xmath5 along @xmath7 manifests itself on @xmath203 as a non - trivial monodromy of the connection around a transverse circle linking @xmath7 . though",
    "i will not have time to say more , the moduli space of such flat connections with monodromies is the space onto which the seifert loop path integral localizes .",
    "this space is directly related to the moduli space of representations of the knot group of @xmath7 in @xmath1 and , in suitable circumstances , fibers over the moduli space of ( non - singular ) flat connections on @xmath0 .",
    "at the cost of introducing defect degrees - of - freedom along @xmath7 , we have managed to describe @xmath6 in terms of a completely local  and indeed linear  functional of @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the same path integral trick that we used to decouple one component of @xmath5 from the chern - simons partition function applies immediately to .",
    "we simply replace @xmath5 in by the shift - invariant acts trivially on @xmath153 . ]",
    "combination @xmath204 , and we then perform the gaussian integral over @xmath109 . in the process , the only new ingredient is that we obtain an extra term linear in @xmath109 from the coupling of @xmath5 to @xmath153 .    without discussing any more details ,",
    "let me present the resulting shift - invariant formulation for the wilson loop path integral , @xmath205}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath206\\,.\\ ] ] the shift - invariant action @xmath207 appears much as the shift - invariant action for @xmath5 alone , with the replacement therein of @xmath81 by the generalized curvature @xmath208 .",
    "thus for an arbitrary wilson loop ( or link ) operator in chern - simons theory , the path integral can be rewritten such that one component of @xmath5 completely decouples .    moreover ,",
    "if @xmath0 is a seifert manifold and @xmath7 is a seifert fiber of @xmath0 , the shift - invariant seifert loop path integral is again an integral of the canonical symplectic form in .",
    "the relevant symplectic space @xmath59 is just the product @xmath209 where the loopspace @xmath197 carries a natural symplectic ( and indeed khler ) form inherited from the khler form @xmath182 on @xmath171 .",
    "the hamiltonian group @xmath61 which acts on @xmath59 is the same group that appears in .",
    "in fact , the loopspace @xmath197 can be interpreted formally as an infinite - dimensional coadjoint orbit of @xmath61 . finally , the square of the moment map for the diagonal action of @xmath61 on @xmath59 is precisely the shift - invariant action @xmath207 appearing in .    for a last bit of furious hand - waving ,",
    "let me remark that the description of the seifert loop operator as a character follows quite naturally from the appearance of the loopspace @xmath197 in .",
    "in essence , non - abelian localization on @xmath197 is related to index theory on @xmath171 , and index theory on @xmath171 provides a classic derivation @xcite of the famous weyl character formula .",
