    "interest in quantum entanglement has grown in recent years motivated mainly by the attempt to understand and realize quantum information processing .",
    "an important aspect of quantum entanglement , which is unavoidable in quantum information processing , is the entanglement of a system with its environment .",
    "this issue is especially important to the feasibility of quantum computation , as the error threshold for fault tolerant error correction ( without which quantum computation is impossible ) , is highly sensitive to the degree to which the environment becomes correlated with the qubits  @xcite . in many realistic quantum computing schemes the environment includes an electromagnetic field ( emf ) .",
    "studies of entanglement between multi - partite systems exist  @xcite , but few have attempted to predict the effects on a qubit from its entanglement with the emf  @xcite .",
    "we have addressed the relaxation and decoherence issues in various contexts , from a two - level atom in a ( zero - temperature ) emf  @xcite to moving atoms in a cavity  @xcite . here",
    "we continue this study for these two issues and the issue of entanglement for a two - level atom in a finite temperature emf .",
    "in this paper we aim at addressing the issue of system - environment entanglement by carefully analyzing its effect on reduced system dynamics . specifically , we study the reduced dynamics of a single qubit interacting with an initially thermal bath in the multimode jaynes - cummings model .",
    "the model is a well studied example of open system dynamics , however , prior analyses have focused on markovian dynamics by assuming no disturbance of the bath modes by the qubit  @xcite .",
    "although such a simplifying assumption does include a level of back - action , it neglects entanglement that forms between the qubit and bath modes during the evolution .",
    "earlier predictions based on simplified markovian approximations are thus unsuitable for studies of such entanglement , and should be scrutinized carefully before being applied to quantum computation ( see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion of this issue bearing on error correction ) .",
    "more realistic physical conditions are better served by non - markovian treatments , which have begun to appear . however , many of them use approximations with limited short - time validity  @xcite or unclear physical meaning such as in non - markovian stochastic schroedinger equations  @xcite .",
    "our approach includes bath dynamics as well as qubit dynamics , and the quantum correlations between them .",
    "analytic expressions are derived for the qubit reduced density matrix elements at low temperature , from which the fidelity ( defined as the overlap between the initial and evolved qubit state ) and von  neumann entropy are computed .",
    "inspection of the matrix elements themselves show slowed ( sub - exponential ) decoherence for the off - diagonal elements and slowed relaxation to thermal asymptotes for the diagonal matrix elements , as compared to markovian predictions .",
    "analysis of the fidelity and von  neumann entropy similarly show slowed loss of fidelity and purity in the case of non - markovian dynamics over markovian dynamics .",
    "the overall picture which develops is of increased preservation of coherence in non - markovian dynamics .",
    "following successive degradation from an exact solution to a markovian description of system - bath interactions , three distinct approximations are usually invoked .",
    "they are 1 ) the @xmath0 order born approximation , 2 ) the @xmath1 markov approximation  @xcite , and 3 ) the assumption of a bath which is unaffected by its interaction with the system .",
    "1 ) the @xmath0 order born approximation is an approximation in the strength of the coupling constant , and applying it neglects terms of higher than @xmath0 order in the coupling  @xcite .",
    "2 ) the @xmath1 markov approximation is an approximation in the back - action correlation time .",
    "it is a markov approximation because it assumes that the back - action of the system onto itself through the bath at time @xmath2 will depend only on the state of the combined system - bath at time @xmath2 , and not on the past history .",
    "it is called the @xmath1 markov approximation because although it depends only on the state of the system at time @xmath2 , it depends on the state of the bath as well as the system ( through the bath averages ) , thus including the bath dynamics  @xcite .",
    "3 ) the last of the above three approximations is the assumption of a bath state which is fixed for all time .",
    "that assumption expressly excludes any dynamical evolution of the bath .    in the usual derivation of the markovian master equation from the schrdinger equation for the system - bath density operator ,",
    "all three approximations are made .",
    "in contrast , the heisenberg - langevin approaches make only the @xmath1 markov approximation .",
    "however , for spin - boson models such approaches have focused on the reduced qubit dynamics in strictly vacuum emf , although in the presence of a classical source ( e.g.  resonance florescence ) .",
    "the resulting equations for the qubit degrees of freedom are called the bloch - langevin equations  @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger - master equation can be derived from the heisenberg - langevin equation after a perturbative expansion which imposes the first and third approximations from the above  @xcite . for a comparison of these approximations",
    "see ref .",
    "our path integral approach to the reduced system dynamics uses only the first of the above three approximations by allowing the combined system - bath to evolve coherently throughout the interaction period . only at the end of all coherent evolution",
    "will the bath variables be traced out to yield the reduced system evolution .",
    "the approach we take is straightforward , although the actual implementation includes some nonstandard techniques involving grassmann path integrals . in section  ii the hamiltonian and other important aspects of the model , including the coherent state represenation , are reviewed .",
    "the transition amplitude is derived in section  iiia , utilizing the coherent state representation for the bosonic degrees of freedom and grassmann states for the qubit degrees of freedom , following  @xcite .",
    "doing so will involve a recursive computation which exploits the semigroup property of the transition matrix ( similar to a technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after evaluating",
    "the transition amplitudes in an intermediate form , we combine the forward and backward versions by tracing over the final bosonic coherent states to construct the reduced propagator in section  iiib . an initial thermal state for the oscillator bath is then introduced and the reduced dynamics of the qubit are calculated in section  iiic .",
    "section  iv gives discussion and further analysis of the results .",
    "the model used for atom - field interactions is the standard multi - mode jaynes - cummings model of a two - level system interacting with a harmonic oscillator bath .",
    "the total hamiltonian under the dipole , rotating wave and two - level approximations is given by ( e.g.  appendix  a of  @xcite ) @xmath3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath5 bath mode with frequency @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the energy separation between the two levels .",

    "slow the drive to thermal equilibrium in non - markovian dynamics , as shown in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , this process is slower in the non - markovian regime .",
    "comparison of these three quantities ( decoherence rate , fidelity and von  neumann entropy ) shows a consistent picture in which non - markovian dynamics is characterized by the preservation of coherence for longer time .",
    "we have studied a two level atom coupled to an electromagnetic field ( emf ) at finite temperature in the multimode jaynes - cummings model .",
    "we have computed the reduced evolution of the two level system and addressed the issues of decoherence , relaxation , and entanglement from its interaction with the emf bath .",
    "our approach makes use of a modified influence functional technique , which enables one to compute the reduced system dynamics while including the entangled evolution of the bath and qubit degrees of freedom .",
    "that is in contrast to markovian approaches , which assume a fixed bath and hence neglect any dynamics in the bath .",
    "we adopt a grassmann coherent state path integral representation for the atom degrees of freedom and bosonic coherent state path integral representation for the electromagnetic field , and assume a weak coupling ( @xmath0  order born ) approximation under low temperature conditions .",
    "we find non - exponential decay for both the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of the qubit s reduced density matrix . from the diagonal elements we see the qubit relax to thermal equilibrium with the bath . from the off - diagonal elements , we see the decoherence rate beginning at the rate usually predicted for a thermal bath , but evolving to the zero temperature decoherence rate as the qubit and bath become entangled .",
    "comparison of the relaxation and decoherence rates , shown in fig .",
    "( 4 ) , reveals that as in the zero temperature case , both rates are comparable . at short times",
    "the ratio of the decoherence to the relaxation rate is initially smaller , but only by a small amount . at higher temperatures the initial difference between the two does increase , but that regime reaches the limits of validity of the present results .",
    "we can see why at low temperatures both rates are related to the atomic transition rate , because it is the only relevant physical scale present ( unlike at finite temperature where the thermal scale is also at work ) .",
    "this , in turn , is a consequence of the particular resonant coupling between the two - level atom and the emf , as explained earlier in  @xcite .    on the entanglement of a qubit with the emf ( under resonant coupling ) we calculated the qubit s fidelity and the von  neumann entropy .",
    "the markovian result predicts higher loss of fidelity and purity as compared with the more accurate non - markovian calculations .",
    "qualitatively , with the inclusion of quantum correlations between the qubit and its environment , the non - markovian processes tend to slow down the drive of the system to equilibrium , prolonging the decoherence and better preserving the fidelity and purity of the system .",
