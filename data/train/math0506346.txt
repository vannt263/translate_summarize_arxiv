    "richard thompson s group @xmath0 has attracted a great deal of interest over the last years .",
    "the group @xmath0 is a finitely presented group which arises quite naturally in different contexts , and allows several different , but fairly simple , descriptions  for instance by a presentation , as a diagram group @xcite , as a group of homeomorphisms of the unit interval , as the geometry group of associativity @xcite , and as the fundamental group of a component of the loop space of the dunce hat .",
    "cannon , floyd and parry @xcite give an excellent introduction to @xmath0 .",
    "the interest in this group stems partly from @xmath0 s unusual properties , and partly from the fact that some of the basic questions about this group are still open , in particular those related to its cogrowth and growth .",
    "it seems clear is that @xmath0 lies very close to the borderline between different regimes .",
    "probably the most famous open question is whether or not @xmath0 is amenable .",
    "also , it is known that @xmath0 has exponential growth , but the growth rate is unknown .",
    "similarly , the rate of escape of random walks in @xmath0 is unknown .",
    "the question of amenability is especially intriguing since @xmath0 is either an example of a finitely presented non - amenable group without free non - abelian subgroups , or an example of a finitely presented amenable but not elementary amenable group .",
    "though there are finitely presented examples of groups for each of these phenomena from grigorchuk @xcite and sapir and olshanskii @xcite , those groups were constructed explicitly for those purposes , whereas @xmath0 is a more `` naturally occurring '' example to consider  so either answer would be remarkable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to contribute new empirical evidence to the quest to understand cogrowth , growth , and escape rate .",
    "this evidence was obtained using large computer simulations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall briefly the definition and those properties of the group @xmath0 that will be needed in the paper .",
    "moreover , we give the definition of amenability which will be used in our experiments ( there are other , equivalent , definitions which are probably more well - known ) . in section 3",
    "we describe the algorithms used in our computations relating to amenability . in section 4",
    "we present the results of our computer experiments , with the aim of obtaining evidence for or against the amenability of @xmath0 . in section 5 ,",
    "we describe two computational approaches to estimate the exponential growth rate of @xmath0 with respect to the standard two - generator generating set , and in section 6 , we describe the results of some computations to measure the average distance from the origin of increasingly - long random walks , known as the rate of escape .",
    "richard j. thompson s group @xmath0 is usually defined as the group of piecewise - linear orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the unit interval , where each homeomorphism has finitely many changes of slope ( `` breakpoints '' ) which all are dyadic integers and and whose slopes , when defined , are powers of 2 .",
    "@xmath0 admits an infinite presentation given by @xmath1 which is convenient for its symmetry and simplicity , while there is a finite presentation given by @xmath2,[x_0x_1^{-1},x_0^{-2}x_1x_0 ^ 2]\\right>.\\ ] ] brin and squier @xcite showed that @xmath0 has no free non - abelian subgroups , and thus the question of the amenability of @xmath0 is potentially connected to the conjecture of von neumann that a group is amenable if and only if it had no free non - abelian subgroups .",
    "the conjecture has since been solved negatively , but the problem of the amenability of @xmath0 is of independent interest and it has been open for at least 25 years .",
    "the usefulness of the infinite presentation is the fact that @xmath0 admits a normal form based on the infinite set of generators .",
    "the relators of the infinite presentation can be used to reorder generators of a given word into an expression of the following form : @xmath3 with @xmath4 this normal form is unique if one requires the following extra condition : if the generators @xmath5 and @xmath6 both appear , then either @xmath7 or @xmath8 must appear as well . indeed , if neither @xmath7 nor @xmath8 appeared , then the relator could be applied so as to obtain a shorter word representing the same element .",
    "the uniqueness of this normal form can be used to solve the word problem in short time : given a word in the infinite set of generators , find the normal form , which can be done in quadratic time , and the element is the identity if and only if the normal form is empty .",
    "this unique normal form is most helpful when the task at hand is to decide whether two words represent the same element of @xmath0 .",
    "if one wishes simply to test whether a given word represents the trivial element of @xmath0 , it is enough to reorder the generators , but without checking the extra condition for uniqueness .    for an introduction to @xmath0 and proofs of its basic properties see cannon , floyd and parry @xcite .",
    "also , for an excellent introduction to amenability , the interested reader can consult wagon @xcite , chapters 10 to 12 .",
    "there are several equivalent definitions of amenability , especially for finitely generated groups .",
    "the standard definition is given by the existence of a finitely - additive left - invariant probability measure on the set of subsets of @xmath9 .",
    "if the group is finitely generated , a celebrated characterization due to flner @xcite in terms of the existence of sets with small boundary , has given a special interest to this concept from the point of view of geometric group theory , making it easier to see that amenability is a quasi - isometry invariant .",
    "the numerical criterion we will use extensively in this paper is due to kesten @xcite and it uses the concept of cogrowth .    let @xmath9 be a finitely generated group and let @xmath10 be a presentation for @xmath9 .",
    "the _ cogrowth _ of @xmath9 is the growth of the subgroup @xmath11 inside @xmath12 . in particular ,",
    "the _ cogrowth function _ of @xmath9 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ball of radius @xmath15 in @xmath12 , and the _ cogrowth rate _ of @xmath9 is @xmath16    kesten s cogrowth criterion for amenability states basically that a group is amenable when it has a large proportion of freely reduced words , for every length @xmath15 , representing the trivial element ; that is , when the cogrowth is large .",
    "[ kesten s criterion ] let @xmath9 be a finitely generated group , and let @xmath17 be a finite set of generators , with cardinal @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be its cogrowth rate",
    ". then @xmath9 is amenable if and only if @xmath20 .",
    "this can also be interpreted in terms of random walks .",
    "if the group is nonamenable ( that is , if there are very few nontrivial words representing the trivial element of the group ) , then the probability of a random walk in the group ending at 1 is small .",
    "since our random walks are taken to be non - reduced , we consider the @xmath21 non - reduced words of length @xmath22 in @xmath18 generators , and let @xmath23 be the set of these words which represent the identity in the group @xmath9",
    ". then , define @xmath24 that is , we define @xmath25 to be the proportion of words which are equal to the identity in @xmath9 .",
    "then , a rewriting of kesten s criterion for non - reduced words can be given by    a group is amenable if and only if @xmath26    roughly speaking , a group is amenable if the probability of a random walk of length @xmath22 returning to @xmath27 decreases more slowly than exponentially with @xmath22 .",
    "this form of the criterion will be used in the subsequent sections to try to study numerically the amenability of @xmath0 .",
    "the direct approach at finding the numbers @xmath25 exactly for thompson s group @xmath0 fails even at quite small values of @xmath22 due to the fact that the number of words grows exponentially , so the computation times get large easily .",
    "for instance , for a length as small as 14 the number of total words is @xmath28=268,435,456 , out of which there are 1,988,452 representing the neutral element , for a value @xmath29",
    ". it would be hard to decide whether the sequence approaches 1 .",
    "a number of improvements can be made to ease the calculation so it becomes more feasible to estimate whether the sequence tends to 1 .",
    "first , we take samples of words of a given length instead of the all words of a given length .",
    "the number @xmath30 grows impracticably large even for small values of @xmath22 , so sampling becomes a necessity .",
    "since the number @xmath25 is basically a proportion ( or a probability ) , it can be approximated by monte carlo methods .",
    "one can always take a random non - reduced word in the two generators @xmath31 and @xmath32 and check if it is the identity by solving the word problem quickly using the normal form . repeating this process one can find a reasonably good approximation of the number @xmath25 .",
    "a further improvement can be implemented by taking only _ balanced _ words .",
    "we observe that , since the two relators in @xmath9 are commutators , a word which represents the identity has to be _ balanced _ : it has to have total exponent zero in both generators @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "so we consider not _ all _ random words , but only balanced ones .",
    "we remark that the abelianization of @xmath0 is @xmath33 , generated by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so being balanced is in fact equivalent to representing the trivial element of @xmath34 .",
    "now we let @xmath35 be the set of balanced words among the @xmath30 non - reduced words of length @xmath22 in @xmath36 , and define @xmath37 the proportion of words representing the identity of @xmath0 among balanced words of length @xmath22 .",
    "we have @xmath38{p(l ) } & = & \\sqrt[l]{\\frac{\\#t(l)}{4^l } } = \\sqrt[l]{\\frac{\\#t(l)}{\\#c(l)}}\\cdot \\sqrt[l]{\\frac{\\#c(l)}{4^l}}\\cr & = & \\sqrt[l]{\\widehat{p}(l ) } \\cdot \\sqrt[l]{\\frac{\\#c(l)}{4^l}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , the last factor @xmath39{\\frac{\\#c(l)}{4^l}}$ ] tends to 1 as @xmath22 tends to infinity , because @xmath40 is amenable .",
    "thus @xmath0 is amenable if and only if we have @xmath41 .",
    "so in order to decide whether @xmath0 is amenable , we shall try to find good approximations of @xmath42 , the proportion of words representing @xmath43 among balanced words of length @xmath22 , and this for values of @xmath22 which are as large as possible .",
    "obviously , the algorithm for creating random balanced words must be designed in such a way that all balanced words of length @xmath22 have the same chance of appearing .",
    "the practical advantage of approximating @xmath42 rather than @xmath25 is that @xmath42 is much larger ( roughly by a factor @xmath44 ) , so much smaller sample sizes are required .",
    "yet another improvement , which substantially increases the efficiency of the algorithm , can be made by using a  divide and conquer \" strategy .",
    "the underlying observation is that if @xmath22 is even , then the probability that a random word of length @xmath22 represents the trivial element of @xmath0 is equal to the probability that two random words of length @xmath45 represent the same element .",
    "thus , the idea of the algorithm is to create a large number @xmath46 of random words of length @xmath45 ( in our implementations , values for @xmath46 between 15,000 and 200,000 were generally used ) .",
    "each of the @xmath46 words is immediately brought into normal form , and these normal forms are stored . in order to decide if two words represent the same element of @xmath0 , we simply compare their normal forms .",
    "therefore we can consider all @xmath47 unordered pairs of words in normal form , and we count how many identical pairs we see .",
    "this number , divided by @xmath48 , is an approximation for the proportion @xmath25 .",
    "however , the description just provided is an oversimplification , because as described above , we would like to restrict our sample to _ balanced _ words . here",
    "we describe the estimation algorithm more precisely :    each iteration of the algorithm has the following steps . in a preliminary step ,",
    "we create one random _ balanced _",
    "word of length @xmath22 .",
    "then we focus our attention on the first half ( the first @xmath45 letters ) of this word and we count which element in the quotient @xmath49 this first half represents that is , we count the exponent sums of the letters @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the first half of the word .    in the second step , we create @xmath46 random words of length @xmath45 which all represent this same element of the abelianization @xmath50 , in such a way that all possible words of length @xmath45 with the given @xmath31-balance and @xmath32-balance have the same chance of appearing .",
    "as soon as it is created , each random word is transformed into normal form , and this normal form is stored .    in the third step , we count the proportion of identical pairs among all @xmath48 unordered pairs of stored words in normal form .    in this way",
    ", each iteration of the algorithm gives an approximation to the true value of @xmath42 .",
    "performing a few thousand iterations , and taking the mean of the proportions obtained in each step , one obtains an approximation to @xmath42 .",
    "the expected value for the result of this algorithm is indeed @xmath42 , which we interpret as the probability that two random words of length @xmath45 represent the same element of @xmath0 , under the condition that they represent the same element of @xmath50 .",
    "it is immediate from the construction of the algorithm that for any pair @xmath51 , the proportion of words representing @xmath52 in @xmath53 among all words constructed by the algorithm is what it should be namely the probability that the first half of a balanced random word of length @xmath22 represents @xmath52 in @xmath50 .",
    "then , having fixed some pair @xmath52 in @xmath40 , we restrict our attention to those iterations of the algorithm that deal with words with @xmath31-balance @xmath54 and @xmath32-balance @xmath55 ( and length @xmath45 ) . we have to prove that the expected value for the proportion of identical pairs of words in our algorithm is what it should be  namely the probability that a pair of random words , chosen with uniform probability from the set pairs of words of length @xmath45 representing the element @xmath52 of @xmath50 , represent the same element of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , we have to prove that our taking words in batches of @xmath46 and comparing all couples in that batch , rather than taking independent samples of pairs of words , does not distort the result .",
    "that , however , follows immediately from the fact that in our algorithm , all pairs of words of length @xmath45 with @xmath31-balance @xmath54 and @xmath32-balance @xmath55 , appear on average with the same frequency ( they have uniform probability ) .",
    "the fact that our @xmath48 samples are not independent has no impact on the expected value .",
    "it does have an impact on the variation , that is , on the size of the error bars , but even this negative impact becomes negligible when we have , on average , less than one identical pair per batch of @xmath46 words , as we typically have .",
    "the authors have implemented the last two algorithms in computer programs written in fortran and c. these programs were run for several weeks on the  wildebeest \" 132-processor beowulf cluster at the city university of new york .",
    "the results of these implementations will be shown in the next section .",
    "the results for the computations of trivial words for @xmath0 are represented in table [ f ] .",
    "this table contains the following information . for lengths @xmath56",
    ", it gives in the second and third columns the sample size ( the number of words that were tested ) and the number of words among them that were found to represent the trivial element of @xmath0 ; thus the quotient of these two quantities is an approximation of @xmath42 .",
    "the fourth column contains the @xmath22th root of this proportion .",
    "the last column contains the @xmath57th root of the quotient of the proportions obtained for length @xmath22 and for length @xmath58 .    in order to clarify the last two columns we remark that the sequences @xmath39{\\widehat{p}(l)}$ ] and @xmath59{\\widehat{p}(l)/\\widehat{p}(l-20)}$ ] have the same limits",
    " for instance if we had @xmath60 then we would obtain @xmath61{\\widehat{p}(l)}= \\lim_{l\\to\\infty}\\sqrt[20]{\\widehat{p}(l)/\\widehat{p}(l-20)}=a\\ ] ] the difference between the two sequences is that the second one converges much more quickly , but it is also more sensitive to statistical errors related to insufficient sample size .    in summary ,",
    "the question of amenability comes down to the question whether the numbers in the last two columns converge to @xmath27 , or to a smaller number .",
