    "the theory of mixed type equations is one the principal parts of the general theory of partial differential equations .",
    "the interest for these kinds of equations arises intensively because of both theoretical and practical of their applications .",
    "many mathematical models of applied problems require investigations of this type of equations .",
    "the actuality of the consideration of mixed type equations has been mentioned , for the first time , by s. a. chaplygin in 1902 in his famous work `` on gas streams '' @xcite .",
    "the first fundamental results in this direction was obtained in 1920 - 1930 by f. tricomi @xcite and s. gellerstedt @xcite .",

    "bibliography of the main fundamental results on this direction can be found , among others , in the monographs of a. v. bitsadze @xcite , y. m. berezansky @xcite , l. bers @xcite , m. s. salakhitdinov and a. k. urinov @xcite and a. m. nakhushev @xcite .    in most of the works devoted to the study of mixed type equations , the object of study was mixed elliptic - hyperbolic type equations .",
    "comparatively , few results have been obtained on the study of mixed parabolic - hyperbolic type equations .",
    "however , this last type of equations have also numerous applications in the real life processes ( see @xcite for an interesting example in mechanics ) .",
    "the reader can found a nice example given , for the first time , by gelfand in @xcite , and connected with the movement of the gas in a channel surrounded by a porous environment . inside the channel the movement of gas was described by the wave equation and outside by the diffusion one .",
    "mathematic models of this kind of problems arise in the study of electromagnetic fields , in heterogeneous environment , consisting of dielectric and conductive environment for modeling the movement of a little compressible fluid in a channel surrounded by a porous medium @xcite . here",
    "the wave equation describes the hydrodynamic pressure of the fluid in the channel , and the equation of filtration - pressure fluid in a porous medium .",
    "similar problems arise in the study of the magnetic intensity of the electromagnetic field @xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", the investigations on local boundary value problems , for mixed equations in domains with non - characteristic boundary data , were intensively increased .",
    "we point out that the studies made on boundary value problems for equations of mixed type , in domains with deviation from the characteristics ( with non - characteristic boundary ) , have been originated with the fundamental works of bitsadze @xcite , where the generalized tricomi problem ( problem m ) for an equation of mixed type is discussed .    in the works @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the analog to the tricomi problem for a modeled parabolic - hyperbolic equation , was investigated in a domain with non - characteristic boundary in a hyperbolic part . moreover ,",

    "regular solvability of the problem b with continuous gluing conditions ( @xmath20 ) have been proved , for the first time , in @xcite , and strong solvability of this problem was proved in the work @xcite .",
    "several properties , including the volterra property of boundary problems for mixed parabolic - hyperbolic equations , have been studied in the works @xcite-@xcite .",
