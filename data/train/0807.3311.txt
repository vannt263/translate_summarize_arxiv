    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    our current knowledge of the @xmath4 s can be summarized as follows @xmath5 where the measurement of @xmath6 comes from the minos experiment and that of @xmath7 from the kamland experiment , see @xcite .",
    "the sign of @xmath8 is determined from the sno experiment .",
    "the mixing angles and phase , using the particle data book convention , are given by @xmath9 the best constraints on @xmath10 come from sno , superk s l / e analysis and chooz respectively , see @xcite .",
    "global fits make only marginal improvements on our knowledge of any of these parameters .",
    "the unknowns that can be addressed via neutrino oscillation experiments are    * the @xmath0 fraction in 3nd mass eigenstate : @xmath11 * the neutrino mass hierarchy : @xmath12 * is cp violated : @xmath3 * is @xmath13 : @xmath14 * unitarity of the mns mixing matrix : # of light sterile @xmath15 s * new interactions and surprises ( the unknown unknowns )    the other important question is whether the light neutrinos are majorana or dirac which can be addressed in neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "survival probability as a function of l / e showing both the atmospheric and solar oscillations .. ,width=302 ]         the most direct way to address the @xmath0 fraction of the 3rd neutrino mass eigenstate is via reactor neutrino disappearance experiments at the first atmospheric oscillation minimum , that is 1 to 2 km from the reactor core .",
    "the @xmath0 survival probability in vacuum is given by ( see fig.[fig : nue_survival ] )    @xmath16    which can be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is used as a shorthand for the the kinematic phase , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the atmospheric @xmath4 for the @xmath0 survival probability .",

    "three experiments are being constructed to look for small values of @xmath11 .",

    "double chooz will start data taking at the end of 2008 with only the far detector with the near detector coming on line in 2009 .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of the double chooz experiment is @xmath23 whereas daya bay which will start in 2009 has an ultimate sensitivity for @xmath24 .",

    "neutrino 2012 will be an interesting time for results from these experiments .",
    "the strength of these experiments is that they directly measure @xmath11 .",
    "however , they have no sensitivity to the mass hierarchy , the size of @xmath25 or whether or not cp is violated in the neutrino sector .",
    "to address the size of @xmath11 , the mass hierarchy , the size of @xmath25 and whether or not cp is violated in the neutrino sector , the appearance process @xmath26 and/or one of its cp and t conjugate processes will need to be measured .",

    "the first row will be explored in very powerful conventional beams , superbeams , whereas the second row could be explored in nu - factories or beta beams .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath26 can be simple written a sum of three amplitudes , one associated with each neutrino mass eigenstate , @xmath27 the first term can be eliminated using the unitarity of the mns matrix and thus the appearance probability can be written as follows@xcite @xmath28 as the notation suggests the amplitude @xmath29 only depends on @xmath30 and @xmath31 only depends on @xmath8 . for propagation in the matter , these amplitudes are simple given by @xmath32     for t2k for 5 years of neutrino running .",

    "thus the phase between @xmath29 and @xmath31 changes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "this changes the interference term from @xmath48 expanding @xmath49 , one has a cp conserving part @xmath50 and the cp violating part @xmath51 therefore cp violation is maximum when @xmath52 and grows as n grows .",
    "notice also , that for this term to be non - zero the kinematical phase @xmath38 can not be @xmath53 .",

    "the asymmetry between @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a maximum when @xmath54 . at the first oscillation maximum ,",
    "@xmath55 , this occurs when @xmath56 in vacuum . for values of @xmath57",
    "the oscillation probabilities are dominated by @xmath58 and thus observing the effects of non - zero @xmath59 become increasing more challenging .",

    "are significantly separated at large values of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : sens ] shows the sensitivity for non - zero @xmath60 for the t2k and no@xmath15a experiments , see @xcite . whereas fig.[fig : hier ] shows the region in the @xmath60 v @xmath42 plane for which the hirarchy is determined for no@xmath15a and the combination of no@xmath15a with t2k .    beyond t2k and no@xmath15a",
    "there are a number of proposals to explore the oscillation probability , @xmath34 , at the second oscillation maximum .",
    "one of these , t2kk , consists of building a second very large detector in korea so that it is down stream from a similar new large detector at kamioka , see @xcite .",
    "another proposal is to build a new neutrino beamline at fermilab to send a broad band neutrino beam to a new very large detector at dusel in the homestake mine , see @xcite . here",
    "the detector could either be a large version of a water cerenkov like superk or be a very large liquid argon detector if this is feasible .",
    "the liquid argon detector has better @xmath61 rejection than the water cerenkov detectors and also has higher sensitivity to the proton decay channel @xmath62 .",
    "the matter effects for these two proposals are quite different .",
    "t2kk experiment gets to the second oscillation peak by using the same energy but three times the baseline whereas fermilab to dusel uses the same baseline but the energy of the neutrinos at the second oscillation peak is one third that of the first oscillation peak .",
    "[ fig : beyond ] shows the difference in the effects of matter on the @xmath63 by varying the energy ( fixed baseline ) and varying the baseline ( fixed energy ) .",
    "thus the difference in the matter effect on the full oscillation probability makes these two proposals complementary and can be used to untangle the effects of matter and cp violation on the oscillation probabilities and thus determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and whether or not cp is violated in the neutrino sector .",
