    "let @xmath7 $ ] be a polynomial ideal in @xmath8 variables @xmath9 $ ] with roots @xmath10 of multiplicities @xmath11 , respectively , and let @xmath12 $ ] be an ideal with clusters @xmath13 such that each cluster @xmath14 has @xmath15 roots around @xmath16 within radius @xmath3 in the @xmath4-norm for @xmath17 .",
    "we present an algorithm which computes an _ approximate radical _ of @xmath18 , denoted by @xmath19 , which has exactly one root for each cluster , and we show that such root corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the cluster .",
    "the method we present in the paper is  global \" in the sense that we do not use any local information about the roots in the clusters , only the coefficients of the system of polynomials defining @xmath18 , and we return another system of polynomials where all near multiplicities are eliminated . in the univariate case such global algorithms",
    "are used for example in approximate factoring ( see @xcite ) , where the input polynomial needs to be  square - free \" in the approximate sense .",
    "previous global methods which handle univariate polynomials with clusters use approximate gcd computation and approximate polynomial division in order to either factor out the near multiplicities or to compute the approximate multiplicity structure and find the roots of the nearest polynomial with the given multiplicity structure @xcite .",
    "the method we propose here offers an alternative algorithm to factor out near multiplicities , which is simpler , and the relation between the accuracy of the output and the size of the clusters is better understood .",
    "we describe separately our method applied to the univariate case , and illustrate its simplicity and accuracy .",
    "our method is based on dickson s lemma , which gives the jacobson radical of a finite dimensional associative algebra over a field of characteristic @xmath20 via the vanishing of traces of elements in the algebra .",
    "an immediate application of dickson s lemma to the algebra @xmath21/i$ ] finds a basis for @xmath22 by finding the nullspace of the _ matrix of traces _",
    "@xmath23 , a matrix computable from the generating polynomials of @xmath24 using either multiplication matrices or other trace computation methods , as described below .",
    "the main focus of the paper is to adapt the method based on dickson s lemma to the case when the ideal @xmath18 has clusters of roots . in the paper",
    "we assume that both @xmath21/i$ ] and @xmath21/\\tilde{i}$ ] are finite dimensional over @xmath25 and have the same basis @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "note that if @xmath24 is generated by a well - constrained system , then ",
    "almost all \" perturbations @xmath18 of @xmath24 will satisfy our assumption , however our results are not limited to well - constrained systems only . on the other hand , the results we prove in this paper measure the accuracy of the output in terms of the size of the clusters , as opposed to the size of the perturbation of the generating polynomials of the ideal @xmath24 .",
    "the extension of our method to handle perturbations which change the structure of the factor algebra and to understand the accuracy of the output in terms of the size of the coefficient perturbation is the subject of future research .",
    "the results in this paper can be summarized as follows :    given the basis @xmath27 and the matrix of traces @xmath23 associated to @xmath0 and @xmath27 , using gaussian elimination with complete pivoting ( gecp ) we give asymptotic estimates of order @xmath5 for the  almost vanishing \" entries in @xmath28 , the partially row reduced matrix of @xmath23 , as well as upper bounds for the coefficients of @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the radius of the clusters in the @xmath4-norm .",
    "these bounds can be used to give a threshold to decide on the numerical rank of @xmath23 , and to indicate the relationship between the numerical rank and the size of the clusters .",
    "alternatively , we show how our results for the gecp of the matrix of traces @xmath23 imply asymptotic bounds on the singular values of @xmath23 .",
    "we also obtain in this case that the  almost vanishing \" singular values are proportional to the square of the size of the clusters .",
    "this implies that for the numerical rank determination of @xmath23 , computing its @xmath29 works similarly as using gecp .    using a basis of the numerical nullspace of @xmath23 ( or possibly an extended version of it )",
    ", we define a set of generating polynomials for the approximate radical ideal @xmath19 , or similarly , define a system of multiplication matrices @xmath30 of @xmath21/\\widetilde{\\sqrt i}$ ] with respect to a basis @xmath31 .",
    "we prove that modulo @xmath5 the generating polynomials of @xmath19 are consistent and have roots with coordinates which are the arithmetic means of the coordinates of the roots in the clusters , which implies that the matrices @xmath30 commute and their eigenvalues are the arithmetic means of the coordinates of the roots in the clusters , all modulo @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , our algorithm finds the coefficients of a polynomial system with roots which are the means of the clusters up to a precision of about twice as many digits as the radius of the clusters , assuming that the clusters are sufficiently small .",
    "let us briefly mention some of the possible methods to compute the matrix of traces @xmath23 , although in the paper we do not elaborate on this aspect . as we shall demonstrate in the paper , the matrix of traces @xmath23 is readily computable from a system of multiplication matrices of @xmath21/\\tilde i$ ] , for example from @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the matrix of the multiplication map by @xmath34 in @xmath21/\\tilde i$ ] written in terms of the basis @xmath27 .",
    "one can compute @xmath33 using grbner bases ( see for example @xcite ) , resultant and subresultant matrices @xcite , lazard s algorithm @xcite , or by methods that combine these @xcite .",
    "thus , our algorithm reduces the problem of finding the eigenvalues of matrices @xmath32 which have clustered eigenvalues to finding eigenvalues of the smaller matrices @xmath30 with well separated eigenvalues .    in certain cases ,",
    "the matrix of traces can be computed directly from the generating polynomials of @xmath0 , without using multiplication matrices .",
    "we refer to the papers @xcite for the computation of traces using residues and newton sums , or @xcite using resultants .",
    "also , fast computation techniques like the  baby steps - giant steps \" method @xcite can be implemented to speed up the computation of all @xmath35 entries of the of traces .",
    "as we prove in the paper , the entries of the matrix of traces @xmath23 are continuous in the size @xmath3 of the root perturbation around @xmath36 , unlike the entries of multiplication matrices which may have many accumulation points as @xmath3 approaches zero . therefore",
    ", avoiding the computation of the multiplication matrices has the advantage of staying away from the possible large computational errors caused by the discontinuity of their entries .",
    "in the multivariate case , most of the methods handling clusters of roots in the literature are  local \" in that they assume sufficiently close approximations for the clusters in question . our algorithm , viewed as having the multiplication matrices as input , is closest to the approach in @xcite in that these papers also reduce the problem to the computation of the eigenvalues of a system of approximate multiplication matrices .",
    "both of these papers propose to reorder the eigenvalues of the multiplication matrices to group the clusters together .",
    "for the reordering of the eigenvalues these papers compute approximations of the eigenvalues by either using the approach in @xcite or using the univariate method of @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our method reorders the eigenvalues of all multiplication matrices simultaneously without approximating the eigenvalues , grouping one eigenvalue from each of the clusters together in a way which facilitates the computation of the means of the clusters and the elimination of the rest of the nearly repeated eigenvalues . another local method to handle near multiple roots",
    "is the `` deflation '' algorithm , studied in the works @xcite , to replace the original system which had a near multiple root with another one which has the same root with multiplicity one , using an approximation of the root in question .",
    "related to the deflation algorithm , in @xcite methods are proposed to compute the multiplicity structure of a root locally in terms of the so called dual basis , and then computing good approximations for the individual roots in the cluster , assuming that either a near system with multiple roots is known , or a sufficient approximation of the multiple root is given .",
    "additionally , methods for computing singular solutions of both polynomials and analytic functions using homotopy continuation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also include here reference to some of the related methods for solving systems of polynomial equations with exact multiplicities : involving the computation of dual bases @xcite , or in the univariate ( or bivariate ) case , using gauss maps @xcite , or analyzing the structure of the multiplication matrices by transforming them to an upper triangular form @xcite .",
    "previous work using dickson s lemma to compute radical ideals in the exact case includes @xcite . also , @xcite uses trace matrices in order to find separating linear forms deterministically .",
    "the present paper is the extended and unabridged version of the paper that appeared in @xcite .",
