    "the purpose of the paper is to study minimum energy problems in the presence of an external field for a condenser @xmath8 with touching oppositely - charged plates @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , relative to the @xmath4-riesz kernel @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the difficulties appearing in the course of our investigation are caused by the fact that a short - circuit between @xmath0 and  @xmath1 might occur , for the euclidean distance between these conductors is zero .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to ask what kind of conditions on the objects in question could prevent such a phenomenon so that a minimizer for the corresponding @xmath4-riesz energy problem might exist .",
    "one of the ideas , to be discussed for this purpose , is to impose upper constraints on the charges of the touching conductors .",
    "we establish sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the existence of minimizing measures for both the unconstrained and the constrained problems , and prove their uniqueness .",
    "the conditions obtained are expressed in geometric - potential terms for  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 , or in measure theory terms for the constraints under consideration , or in terms of variational inequalities for the weighted potentials .",
    "we also provide a detailed analysis of the supports of the minimizers .    the approach developed in the paper",
    "is based on a newly discovered important relationship between , on the one hand , minimum @xmath4-riesz energy problems over signed measures associated with a condenser  @xmath8 and , on the other hand , minimum energy problems for nonnegative measures on  @xmath0 relative to the @xmath4-green function  @xmath9 of the domain @xmath10 .    regarding the latter problems , crucial to the arguments applied in their investigation is the pre - hilbert structure on the linear space  @xmath11 of all ( signed ) borel measures on  @xmath12 with finite @xmath9-green energy and , most importantly , a completeness theorem for certain metric subspaces of  @xmath13 with nonnegative elements .",
    "this completeness theorem enables us , in particular , to analyze the existence of the @xmath4-green equilibrium measure of a set .",
