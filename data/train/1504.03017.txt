    "the qcd sum - rule approach @xcite , based on the application of wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) to the properties of individual hadrons , has been extensively used for predicting heavy - meson decay constants .",
    "an  important finding of these analyses was the strong sensitivity of the decay constants to the values of the input ope parameters and to the prescription of fixing the effective continuum threshold @xcite .",
    "the latter governs the accuracy of the quark ",
    "hadron duality approximation and , to a large extent , determines the extracted value of the decay constant .",
    "even  if  the parameters of the truncated ope are known with arbitrarily high precision , the decay constants may be predicted with only limited accuracy , which we refer to as their systematic uncertainty . in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "we have  formulated a new algorithm for fixing the effective threshold within borel qcd sum rules and for obtaining reliable estimates  for the systematic uncertainties .",
    "this procedure opened the possibility to provide predictions for the decay constants  with a controlled accuracy @xcite .    here",
    ", we study the decay constants of the vector beauty mesons @xmath2 and @xmath11 . as is already known from the analysis of the decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite",
    ", the ope uncertainties in the obtained predictions  are rather large .",
    "the same occurs also for the @xmath0 and @xmath14 mesons .",
    "however , the ope uncertainties to a great extent cancel out in the ratios of the decay constants of vector and pseudoscalar beauty mesons .",
    "an important result reported here is that the systematic uncertainties of the decay constants are rather small and well under control .",
    "therefore , these ratios are predicted with a very good accuracy . it should be taken into account that we address a rather subtle effect at a few - percent level ; a priori , it is not clear whether qcd sum rules are , in principle , capable to provide  theoretical predictions at this level of accuracy .",
    "obviously , the control over the systematics is becoming crucial .",
    "the ratio of the decay constants of vector over pseudoscalar heavy mesons is an interesting quantity : it is known to be unity in the heavy - quark limit and to approach this limit from below because of the radiative corrections @xcite . for beauty mesons ,",
    "the few existing sum - rule analyses ( which , however , could not gain good control over the systematic uncertainties ) reported @xmath8 slightly above unity @xcite .",
    "constituent - quark models typically also yield @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by interpolation of the lattice data from the charm - quark mass region to the beauty - quark mass @xcite .    the first indication that this ratio for beauty mesons is below unity",
    "was given in our papers @xcite .",
    "recently , hpqcd @xcite also reported an accurate value of @xmath16 , in excellent agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , although conclusively indicating @xmath16 , observed an unpleasant dependence of the extracted decay constants of the vector beauty mesons on the renormalization scale @xmath17 chosen for the evaluation of the vector correlation function .",
    "this analysis solves the problem of the sensitivity to the choice of the scale @xmath17 by improving the extraction procedures for the decay constants and arrives at new predictions stable with respect to the choice of @xmath17 .",
    "our detailed results read @xmath18 in more than excellent agreement with the latest results from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize once more that  the ope uncertainties cancel to a large extent in the above ratios .",
    "thus , decisive for obtaining an accurate sum - rule  result is our capability to control the systematic uncertainties of the qcd sum - rule method .",
    "the decay constants of ground - state vector mesons may be extracted by analyzing the two - point correlation function @xmath20 of the heavy ",
    "light vector currents for a heavy quark @xmath21 of mass @xmath22 and a light quark @xmath23 of mass @xmath24 , @xmath25 or , more precisely , the borel transform of its transverse structure @xmath26 to the borel variable @xmath27 , @xmath28 . equating  @xmath28  as calculated within qcd and the expression obtained by insertion of a complete set of",
    "hadron states yields the sum  rule @xmath29 here , @xmath30 labels the mass , @xmath19 the decay constant , and @xmath31 the polarization vector of the vector meson @xmath32 under  study : @xmath33 for the correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) , @xmath34 is the physical continuum threshold , wherein @xmath35 denotes the mass of  the lightest pseudoscalar meson containing @xmath21 . for large values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the ground state dominates the correlator  and  thus its properties may be extracted from the correlation function ( [ 1.1 ] ) .    in perturbation theory , the correlation function",
    "is found as an expansion in powers of the strong coupling `` constant '' @xmath36 .",
    "the best known three - loop perturbative spectral density has been calculated in @xcite in terms of the pole mass  of the heavy quark @xmath21 ( that is , in the present case , @xmath37 ) and for a massless second quark [ hereafter , we use the abbreviation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the running coupling at renormalization scale @xmath40 in the @xmath41 scheme ] : @xmath42 for both quarks having nonzero masses , the two - loop spectral density in terms of their pole masses was obtained  in  @xcite .",
    "the power corrections are also separately scale - independent ; their explicit expressions can be found in @xcite .",
    "for instance , for pseudoscalar ( @xmath43 ) and vector ( @xmath32 ) currents the quark - condensate contributions may be written in the  form @xmath44,\\\\ \\pi^v_{\\rm power}(\\tau ) & = & -\\overline{m}_b(\\nu)\\langle\\bar qq(\\nu)\\rangle \\left[\\exp(-m_b^2\\tau)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}c_f a\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2}c_f a\\ , m_b^2\\tau \\,\\gamma(-1,m_b^2\\tau)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the @xmath46-quark @xmath41 mass at renormalization scale @xmath40 , @xmath47 is a scale - independent combination ,  and @xmath48 is the incomplete gamma function @xcite .",
    "however , even if the lowest - order contributions to the perturbative expansion and the vacuum condensates of lowest dimensions are known to good accuracy , a truncated ope does not allow one to calculate the correlator for sufficiently large @xmath27 , such that the continuum states give a negligible contribution to @xmath28 in the corresponding range of @xmath27 . in  order",
    "to get rid of the continuum contribution , the concept of duality is invoked : perturbative - qcd spectral density @xmath49 and hadron spectral density @xmath50 resemble each other at large values of @xmath51 ; thus , for values of the integration lower limit @xmath52 chosen sufficiently large , that is to say , ( far ) above the resonance region , one arrives at the duality relation @xmath53 now , in order to express the hadron continuum contribution in terms of the perturbative contribution , the relation ( [ duality1 ] ) should be extended down to the hadronic or physical threshold @xmath54 .",
    "however , since the spectral densities  @xmath55  and @xmath50 obviously differ in the region near @xmath54 , one can reasonably only expect to obtain a relationship of the form @xmath56 where the effective threshold @xmath57 is clearly different from the physical threshold @xmath54 , @xmath58 , and , moreover , must be a function of the borel parameter @xmath27 @xcite . by virtue of ( [ duality ] )",
    ", we may hence rewrite the qcd sum rule ( [ pitau ] )  as @xmath59 we refer to the right - hand side of this relation as the _ dual correlator _ , and to the masses and decay constants extracted from this expression as the corresponding _ dual _ quantities .",
    "in addition to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the extraction  of @xmath19 requires , as further input , a criterion that fixes the functional behaviour of the effective continuum threshold  @xmath57 .",
    "we shall demonstrate that qcd sum rules allow a very satisfactory extraction of the vector - meson decay constants , with an accuracy that is certainly competitive to that found within the framework of lattice qcd .",
    "the starting point of our discussion is the ope for the correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the three - loop perturbative spectral density @xmath62 was calculated in @xcite in terms of the pole mass  of the heavy quark .",
    "a nice feature of the pole - mass ope is that each of the known perturbative contributions to the dual correlator is positive .",
    "unfortunately , the pole - mass  ope does not provide a visible hierarchy of the perturbative contributions to the extracted predictions , which raises doubts whether the @xmath63-truncated pole - mass ope is indeed a good starting point for a reliable analysis of decay constants .",
    "a well - known remedy is to reorganize the perturbative expansion in terms of the @xmath46-quark running @xmath41 mass @xmath64 , related ( in the notations of @xcite ) to the corresponding pole mass @xmath37 by @xmath65 the spectral densities in the @xmath41 scheme are found by expanding the pole - mass spectral densities in powers of  @xmath66 and omitting terms of order @xmath67 and higher ; starting at order @xmath68 , they contain two parts : the `` genuine '' part  from @xcite and the part induced by the lower perturbative orders when expanding the pole mass in terms of the running  mass . by this , however , due to the truncation of the perturbative series , one gets an explicit ( unphysical ) dependence of  the dual correlator and of the extracted decay constant on the scale @xmath17 . in principle",
    ", any scale should be equivalently  good . in practice",
    ", however , the distinctness of the hierarchy of the perturbative contributions to the dual correlator depends on the precise choice of the scale .",
    "this opens a possibility of choosing the scale @xmath17 such that the hierarchy of the new perturbative expansion is improved .",
    "figures [ plot:1a ] and [ plot:1b ] depict the dual decay constants of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 mesons , respectively . for the  @xmath46-quark @xmath41 mass",
    ", we use the value determined in @xcite by matching our qcd sum - rule results for @xmath4 to those of lattice  qcd : gev @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent overview of the @xmath46-quark mass results )  leads to a considerably larger value of @xmath4 , incompatible with the latest lattice - qcd results .",
    "however , the precise value of @xmath69 has  negligible impact on the ratio of the decay constants of vector and pseudoscalar mesons . ]",
    "@xmath70 the numerical values adopted for other relevant ope parameters are @xcite @xmath71 ^ 3,\\quad \\frac{\\langle\\bar ss\\rangle(2\\;{\\rm gev})}{\\langle\\bar qq\\rangle(2\\;{\\rm gev})}=0.8\\pm0.3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the purpose of figs .",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the corresponding qcd sum - rule outcome for the @xmath12-meson decay constant @xmath4 from our earlier investigation @xcite reads @xmath73 as is obvious from ( [ fb * ] ) and ( [ fb ] ) , the ope uncertainties cancel out , to a great extent , in the ratio , which , consequently , can be predicted with a rather high accuracy : @xmath74 the main contribution to the ope error in the ratio arises from the gluon condensate , which enters with different  sign in the pseudoscalar and the vector correlator ( in detail : @xmath75 ) .",
    "the total uncertainty  of  the ratio is dominated by the _",
    "systematic _ uncertainties of the decay constants .",
    "figure  [ plot : bootstrap ] shows the distribution of the ratio as obtained by a bootstrap analysis .      for @xmath1",
    ", we choose the same borel - parameter window as for @xmath0 and again require that the deviation of the dual  mass from the known @xmath14 mass does not exceed 10 mev in the full @xmath27 window .",
    "our findings for the @xmath1-meson decay constant may be cast in the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is defined in ( [ fbsstarmu ] ) and    @xmath78    unfortunately , the sensitivity of @xmath3 to the choice of the scale @xmath17 at which the vector correlator is evaluated turns out to be rather pronounced .",

    "our corresponding estimates read @xmath84 as seen in fig .  [",
    "plot : fv_vs_mu ] , the sensitivity of @xmath5 to the choice of @xmath17 is negligible .",
    "the total ope uncertainty of @xmath5 is rather  large : @xmath85 the decomposition of the ope error reads : 11.5 mev are due to the error of @xmath51-quark condensate and 14.1 mev due to the error of @xmath69 , the uncertainties of the other ope parameters contribute at the level of 1 mev .",
    "similar to the @xmath8 case , except for the gluon - condensate contribution the ope uncertainties cancel , to a great extent ,  in the ratio of the decay constants , which may thus be predicted rather accurately : @xmath86 the ope uncertainty in the ratio is dominated by the sensitivity of @xmath3 to the choice of the scale @xmath17 .",
    "the ( obligatory ) bootstrap analysis gives for the ratio @xmath9 the nearly gaussian distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ plot : bootstrap ] .",
    "exploiting the tools offered by qcd sum rules , we analyzed in great detail the decay constants of the beauty vector mesons , paying special attention to the uncertainties arising in our predictions for the decay constants : the ope  error , related to the precision with which the qcd parameters are known , and the systematic error , intrinsic to the qcd sum - rule approach as a whole , reflecting the limited accuracy of the extraction procedure .",
    "our findings are as follows :    * as was already noted in the case of heavy pseudoscalar mesons @xcite , also for the vector correlator the perturbative expansion in terms of the heavy - quark pole - mass does not exhibit good convergence . reorganizing the ope in terms of the corresponding running mass allows us to choose a range of scales for which , upon evaluation of the correlator , the perturbative hierarchy becomes explicit . for scales",
    "@xmath873 gev , also the running - mass ope does not exhibit any hierarchy of perturbative contributions ; at too large scales @xmath886 gev , we observe a strong cancellation between the large positive zero - order and the large negative first - order contributions ,  thus signalling that the accuracy of the ope may deteriorate .",
    "there is , however , a sizeable interval of scales , @xmath89 , where the @xmath90-truncated ope provides a good description of the dual correlation function . * requiring the known value of the meson mass to be well reproduced in a relatively broad @xmath27 window leads , in  the case of the vector mesons , to some correlation between the scale @xmath17",
    "at which the correlator is evaluated and the upper boundary of the @xmath27 window : for @xmath88 gev , the borel window for the vector correlator shrinks and thus no meaningful extraction of the decay constants of @xmath0 and @xmath14 from sum rules is possible .",
    "the observed correlation between the parameters of the borel window and the value of @xmath17 strongly reduces the ( unphysical ) @xmath17 dependence of the extracted beauty - meson decay constants .",
    "* the @xmath27-dependence of the effective threshold and the details of the algorithm for fixing this quantity are crucial for obtaining realistic estimates of the systematic uncertainty of the extracted decay constant . for the analysis  of the ratios of the decay constants of vector to pseudoscalar beauty mesons , where the mass splitting between  the vector and the pseudoscalar partners amounts to some @xmath91 mev only , the stringent requirement to reproduce  this splitting and the individual masses of vector and pseudoscalar beauty mesons with an accuracy not worse than 5 mev in the full @xmath27 range is crucial for obtaining the low systematic uncertainty of the extracted decay constants .",
    "* the decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector beauty mesons exhibit a strong dependence on the precise value of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath92 and @xmath93 decay constants suffer from large ope uncertainties .",
    "the  systematic uncertainties of the extracted decay constants are of the level of a few mev and remain under good control . * the ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "can be predicted with very good accuracy because of large cancellations between the ope uncertainties in the ratios and a good control over the systematic uncertainties of the decay constants .",
    "our final results read @xmath94 where the error given is the total uncertainty , including the systematic and the ope uncertainty .",
    "the resulting distributions are close to normal distributions ( fig .",
    "[ plot : bootstrap ] ) , thus the quoted errors are gaussian standard deviations .",
