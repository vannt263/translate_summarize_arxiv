    "the broadband emission of pulsars from radio frequencies to @xmath3-rays can be used to probe the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "specifically , their radio pulsations allow accurate measurements of the free electron column density and their x - ray extinction traces the interstellar gas along the line of sight .",
    "radio waves travelling in the ism are dispersed by free electrons such that signals at lower frequencies propagate at a lower speed and hence arrive on earth later than those at higher frequencies .",
    "the time delay ( @xmath4 ) between two observing frequencies ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) depends on the dispersion measure ( dm ) , which is the integrated free electron number density @xmath7 from earth to the source at distance @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are electron mass and charge , respectively , and @xmath12 is the speed of light .",
    "most free electrons in our galaxy are found in the hot phase of the ism , including hii regions ionized by uv radiation from hot o or b type stars and the shock - heated interior of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "these sources can contribute significant dm up to a few hundred parsecs per cubic centimeter . at x - ray energies ,",
    "photons are absorbed mostly by heavy elements in the interstellar gas due to the photoelectric effect .",
    "this has a strong energy dependence and is most prominent in the soft x - ray band . as a result",
    ", it modifies the observed low - energy portion of the x - ray spectrum and has to be accounted for in spectral modeling .",
    "the amount of extinction , which is expressed in terms of the equivalent atomic hydrogen column density @xmath0 , is sensitive to gas and molecular clouds , which traces the warm and cold phases of the ism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one natural question to ask is whether there is any correlation between dm and @xmath0  in our galaxy .",
    "such a correlation can reflect the physical connection between different phases of the ism .",
    "also , it can provide a useful tool to estimate one quantity from the other , help plan new observations and determine x - ray luminosity upper limits in cases of non - detection . in the literature , an average ionization fraction of 10% in the ism , i.e.  one free electron per 10 equivalent hydrogen atoms , has been commonly assumed in order to infer @xmath0  from dm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the justification for this choice has been unclear .",
    "x - ray - emitting radio pulsars offer a powerful diagnostic tool for a quantitative study of the correlation . because they are model - independent and relatively straightforward to measure from radio timing , dm values are well determined , typically to better than a fractional uncertainty of @xmath13 . however , what has made the determination of any dm-@xmath0  correlation difficult in the past is the lack of high - quality x - ray data for @xmath0  measurements . in particular , previous generations of x - ray telescopes had poor angular resolution that precluded discerning the pulsar emission from that of the surrounding snrs and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "thanks to new x - ray missions such as the _ chandra _  _ x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton _ , precise measurements of @xmath0  have been obtained for many pulsars in recent years , allowing a statistical study of @xmath0  values for the first time .    in this paper",
    ", we compile a list of dm and @xmath0  values for 68 x - ray - emitting radio pulsars using the latest _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  measurements reported in the literature .",
    "we found a clear correlation between these two column densities and obtained a best - fit empirical relation of @xmath2% ionization . in section 2",
    ", we describe our sample selection criteria .",
    "the statistical analysis and results are presented in section  3 , and we discuss the implications of our results in section  4 .",
    "we started with a list of x - ray detected radio pulsars from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , then expanded the sample through careful literature searches for updated observational results and recent discoveries .",
    "the latter include three magnetars that show radio emission @xcite and over a dozen new pulsars identified in @xmath3-rays with the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ and subsequently detected in follow - up radio and x - ray observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally to complete the list , we went through the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  data archive to search for pulsar observations , and looked up relevant publications based on these data .",
    "the pulsar dms are adopted from the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite .",
    "they are all very well measured with negligible uncertainties compared to those for @xmath0 . on the other hand , it is much more difficult to determine @xmath0 , because this requires a strong x - ray source and good knowledge of the intrinsic emission spectrum .",
    "the x - ray emission of pulsars is not fully understood ; commonly used models include a blackbody ( bb ) and a neutron - star hydrogen atmosphere ( nsa ) for the thermal emission , and a power law ( pl ) for the non - thermal emission .",
    "more complicated models consisting of thermal and non - thermal components are sometimes used . to minimize any bias , we selected the @xmath0  values for our sample according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "we restricted our choices to those in the latest studies using the _ chandra_and _ xmm - newton _  observations , since the good angular resolution and sensitivity of these telescopes offer high - quality spectra with minimal background contamination .",
    "any joint fits with other x - ray telescopes are not considered , in order to avoid cross - calibration uncertainties .",
    "we adopted only @xmath0  values from actual x - ray spectral fits in which the @xmath0  is allowed to vary freely , and ignored any @xmath0  inferred from dm , optical extinction ( a@xmath14 ) , or total galactic hi column density .",
    "3 .   @xmath0  from the best - fit spectral model is always preferred , unless there are physical arguments favoring another model .",
    "if different emission models give the same goodness - of - fit and the authors do not indicate a clear preference , we choose the simpler one .",
    "for example , we prefer a bb model over an nsa model , since the latter requires more assumptions , including the atmosphere composition , surface magnetic field and gravity .",
    "4 .   for pulsars associated with bright pwne ,",
    "the nebular @xmath0  values are adopted if they are better constrained than those of the pulsars , because the simple pl spectra of pwne can reduce systematic uncertainties in spectral modeling .",
    "@xmath0  from snrs are used in a few cases when the pulsars and pwne are too faint for useful @xmath0  measurements .",
    "our final sample contains 68 pulsars .",
    "one of them ( psr b0540@xmath1569 ) is extragalactic and only two ( psrs j1740@xmath155340 and b1821@xmath1524 ) are in globular clusters ; cluster pulsars are generally too faint for precise @xmath0measurements .",
    "the pulsar dm and @xmath0  values are listed in table  [ table ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : dmnh ] .",
    "the reported statistical uncertainties and upper limits for @xmath0  are at 90% confidence level , i.e.  1.6@xmath16 .",
    "we list in the table the x - ray spectral models used to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of spectral model is clear in all cases except psrs j1622@xmath154950 and b1757@xmath1524 , for which both thermal and non - thermal fits are acceptable .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath0  from different fits only varies by a factor of 2 for j1622@xmath154950 and does not change for b1757@xmath1524 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that systematic bias induced by spectral models is minimal .",
    "table  [ table ] also shows the pulsar galactic coordinates ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and distances , and this information was used to calculate the vertical height ( @xmath19 ) from the galactic plane .",
    "the coordinates are taken from the atnf pulsar catalog and distance estimates are obtained from parallax measurements , hi absorption measurements of the pulsars or the associated snrs , or dm using the ne2001 galactic electron density model @xcite . if available , parallax distances are always preferred since they are the most accurate .",
    "all parallax and hi distances are adopted from @xcite and references therein , and have been corrected for the lutz - kelker bias , except for psr  j1023 + 0038 , which has a recent parallax measurement by @xcite . for dm distances , we did not attempt to derive the uncertainties , but note that the fractional uncertainties could be 25% or larger ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , there are exceptional cases in which previous studies argue for different distances than the dm - estimated ones .",
    "they are noted in the table .",
    "the pulsar @xmath0  and dm are plotted against distance in figures  [ fig : nhdist ] and [ fig : dmdist ] , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmnh ] shows a positive correlation between the pulsar dm and @xmath0  values , with deviations ranging from a factor of a few to an order of magnitude .",
    "there are some obvious outliers , including the vela pulsar ( psr  b0833@xmath1545 ) , the double pulsar ( psr  j0737@xmath153039 ) , and psr  j1747@xmath152809 in the galactic center direction .",
    "to quantify the dm-@xmath0  correlation , we ignored pulsars with @xmath0  upper limits and obtained a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0.72 .",
    "this is significant since the one - tailed probability of such a correlation arising by chance from unrelated variables is only @xmath20 .",
    "more useful is an empirical relation between these two observables .",
    "we performed a linear fit to the data by minimizing the @xmath21 value .",
    "@xmath0  measurements with fractional uncertainties larger than 80% or upper limits only ( gray points in figure  [ fig : dmnh ] ) are excluded in the fit .",
    "we also ignored the vela pulsar , which is located in the gum nebula inside the hot and low - density local bubble , and psr  b0540@xmath1569 , which is in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , because they seem unlikely to follow the dm-@xmath0  correlation as would other galactic sources . only statistical uncertainties in @xmath0",
    "are considered in the @xmath21-fit since uncertainties in dm are negligible . also , we did not attempt to model the systematic uncertainties , but we note that the ones introduced by different photoelectric absorption models and elemental abundances , or by cross - calibration between telescopes are only at a few percent level ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , relatively small compared to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "assuming @xmath0  and dm are directly proportional , the best fit gives @xmath22 corresponding to an average ionization of @xmath2% .",
    "the 90% confidence interval is quoted here , which is obtained from 10000 simulations via bootstrapping resampling @xcite .",
    "the result is plotted in figure  [ fig : dmnh ] .",
    "we also tried fitting a more general linear relation by fitting the y - intercept as well , but found that the latter is consistent with zero at 90% confidence . if we ignore the measurement uncertainties in @xmath0  and perform a least squares fit , we obtain @xmath23 , giving a lower average ionization of 4% .    to check if the dm-@xmath0  relation could depend on the source location in the galaxy , we divided the sample into groups according to their vertical height from the plane and their galactic longitudes .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : dmnh](b ) and [ fig : dmnh](c ) , respectively . in the high - dm regime ,",
    "sources toward the galactic center direction , e.g. , psrs j1747@xmath152958 and j1747@xmath152809 , show a hint of a larger @xmath0-to - dm ratio . however , the systematic variation is less clear at lower dm and our limited sample precludes a detailed analysis . in figure  [ fig : nhdist ] we plotted @xmath0against distance .",
    "this indicates a general correlation , albeit with a large scatter .",
    "there is also a hint that for sources at a similar distance , @xmath0  is systematically larger near the galactic plane ( figure  [ fig : nhdist](b ) ) , however , the dependency on galactic longitude is less clear ( figure  [ fig : nhdist](c ) ) . the dm variation with distance",
    "is presented in figure  [ fig : dmdist ] .",
    "while this may seem to exhibit a good correlation at large distances , we note that sources with dm - derived distances provide no new information , only the ne2001 model prediction .",
    "in addition , there is a very large range of dms for nearby pulsars around 300pc , from @xmath24pc@xmath25 for psr  j0108@xmath151431 to @xmath26pc@xmath25 for the vela pulsar , spanning nearly a factor of 30 .",
    "similar to @xmath0 , figure  [ fig : dmdist](b ) also indicates a higher dm toward the galactic plane .",
    "we have investigated the dm-@xmath0  connection for 68 radio pulsars detected with _",
    "chandra _  or _ xmm - newton_. we found a good correlation between these two column densities , suggesting that free electrons in the galaxy generally trace the interstellar gas .",
    "that said , some @xmath0  values in figure  [ fig : dmnh ] show significant deviation from the best - fit line , by a factor of a few up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this could be attributed to inhomogeneity of the ism , possibly due to molecular clouds , supernova remnants , or hii regions in the line of sight .",
    "such an effect is more prominent for nearby sources , since the distribution of free electrons and interstellar gas is highly anisotropic around the local bubble ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , there is significant dm contribution from the gum nebula @xcite , resulting in a wide range of dms for pulsars within @xmath27300pc ( e.g. , the vela pulsar and psr  j0737@xmath153039 ; see figure  [ fig : dmdist ] ) . at large distances ,",
    "local fluctuations are expected to average out and the scatter of @xmath0  and dm with respect to distance likely arises from galactic structure , such as the disk , spiral arms , and different scale heights of various ism components ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have attempted to identify any systematic trends in dm and @xmath0  with respect to source location .",
    "while figures  [ fig : nhdist](b ) and [ fig : dmdist](b ) hint at higher @xmath0  and dm toward the galactic plane , more sources are needed for a quantitative comparison with the detailed galactic structure . beyond our galaxy ,",
    "we note that while psr  b0540@xmath1569 in the lmc was not used in the fit , its dm - to-@xmath0  ratio lies close to the best - fit line in figure  [ fig : dmnh ] .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because of the different interstellar abundances in the lmc than in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "we argue that this could merely be a coincidence rather than the general case .",
    "indeed , the lmc contributes 90% of the @xmath0  toward psr  b0540@xmath1569 @xcite but only two thirds of the dm @xcite .    the dm-@xmath0  correlation can be used to estimate one quantity from the other , offering a useful tool for pulsar observations .",
    "for instance , radio pulsations have been claimed from the magnetar 4u  0142 + 61 with a dm of @xmath28pc@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "given its @xmath0  value of @xmath29@xmath30  @xcite , the claimed dm seems somewhat small when compared to other sources of similar @xmath0  in figure  [ fig : dmnh ] . for x - ray observations , there are many cases requiring _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath0 , including flux estimates when planning for new observations , measuring the intrinsic spectra of faint sources , and deriving luminosity limits for non - detection . in many previous studies ,",
    "@xmath0  is inferred from the dm by assuming one free electron per ten neutral hydrogen atoms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our result directly confirms that this is a reasonable approximation , but as a caveat , the scatter in @xmath0  is typically a factor of a few up to an order of magnitude .",
    "in addition to dm , the total galactic hi column density from 21-cm radio surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and a@xmath14 have also been used as proxies for the x - ray absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these @xmath0estimates are plotted in figure  [ fig : nhest ] .",
    "it is clear that some x - ray - inferred @xmath0  values exceed the total hi column density of the galaxy . as shown in the figure , the latter saturates at @xmath31@xmath30 , resulting in gross underestimates for high - dm ( @xmath32pc@xmath25 ) or distant ( @xmath33kpc ) pulsars .",
    "it has been reported that at high galactic column densities @xmath34@xmath30 , which occur at low galactic latitudes , the x - ray absorption columns are generally larger than the hi columns by a factor of 1.53 @xcite .",
    "this agrees with our result and indicates significant x - ray absorption due to molecular clouds rather than neutral hydrogen atoms , hence , the hi column may not be a good tracer for the x - ray absorption .",
    "a@xmath14 , on the other hand , is caused by grains of the same heavy elements that give rise to x - ray absorption , therefore , it highly correlates with @xmath0  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . given a pulsar s position and distance ,",
    "a@xmath14 can be estimated from the 3d extinction maps of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and then @xmath0  can be deduced from the empirical relation @xmath0(@xmath30)=@xmath35a@xmath14 ( mag ) @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : nhest ] , this method seems to give the best agreement between measured and predicted values , especially for the highest-@xmath0pulsars .",
    "it is worth noting that in some cases dms were used to infer the pulsar distances , which then give a@xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "this generally provides better results than directly employing the dm-@xmath0  correlation .",
    "we believe that this is because the a@xmath14 map reflects the distribution of heavy elements in the galaxy , whereas this crucial information can not be obtained from dm .",
    "we have compiled a list of 68 pulsar @xmath0  measurements reported in the literature using _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations , and compared the @xmath0  values with the dms and distances .",
    "our results show a good correlation between dm and @xmath0 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.72 .",
    "we obtained an empirical linear relation @xmath36 , implying an average ionization of @xmath2% .",
    "this confirms the ratio of one free electron to ten neutral hydrogen atoms commonly used in previous studies .",
    "our finding provides a useful tool to estimate @xmath0from dm .",
    "we compare to other @xmath0  estimates based on the neutral hydrogen column density and a@xmath37 , and find that the latter gives the best results , while hi and our empirical dm-@xmath0  relation tend to give underestimates in the high-@xmath0  regime .",
    "the next generation of x - ray missions , including erosita @xcite and the proposed neutron star interior composition explorer ( nicer ; * ? ? ? * ) , will significantly expand the pulsar @xmath0  sample .",
    "in addition , the foreseen square kilometer array ( ska ) can provide parallax measurements of a few thousand radio pulsars @xcite . together",
    "these will allow a detailed study of the dm-@xmath0  relation in different parts of the galaxy and its connection with the galactic structure .",
    "in addition to pulsars , it should be possible to compile a database of @xmath0  measurements for other galactic x - ray sources , such as stars , supernova remnants , cataclysmic variables , stellar clusters , white dwarfs , and x - ray binaries , and compare with their distances to build a 3d @xmath0  map of our galaxy .",
