    "two - dimensional materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have shown good potential as the basis for future electronics technologies @xcite . similarly , black phosphorus ( black - p ) is considered to be a promising candidate for many applications in electronics @xcite and optoelectronics @xcite , because , for a small band - gap semiconductor , it displays high mobility charge carriers and can easily be exfoliated @xcite .",
    "similar to graphite , due to the weak interlayer van der waals interactions , black phosphorus can be reduced to a single atomic bi - layer ( here we refer to this as a `` monolayer '' ) , commonly referred to as phosphorene @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of phosphorene differ significantly from its bulk counterpart @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic lack of a band gap in graphene has been an obstacle for the construction of devices , inspiring work to overcome this deficit through doping or strain ( see , e.g. , references ) .",
    "black phosphorus on the other hand has a small intrinsic band - gap , which can be tuned into a dirac semimetal @xcite .",
    "+   + black phosphorus is the thermodynamically stable phosphorus form , but it oxidizes when exposed to water and oxygen @xcite .",
    "therefore , related and more stable layered semiconductors are of significant interest . similar to the relationship between group iv si and iii - v semiconductors like gaas , binary iv - vi compounds such as ges , gese , sns and snse are isoelectronic and isostructural to group v black phosphorus @xcite .",
    "these compounds also have the potential for application .",
    "for example snse has an extraordinarily high thermoelectric figure of merit along its @xmath5-axis @xcite , and monolayer and double - layer snse and gese have been considered as promising materials for ultrathin - film photovoltaic applications @xcite .",
    "here we report the unique structure and basic electronic properties of a previously unreported layered form of gese , which we designate as @xmath0-gese .",
    "it is stable under ambient conditions , although we synthesized it at high - pressure and high - temperature .",

    "polycrystalline @xmath1-gese was synthesized by heating germanium pieces ( purity 99.999% ) and polished selenium shot ( purity 99.95% ) in an evacuated quartz tube to 750 @xmath6c where it was annealed for 48h ; the product was cooled to room temperature at 180 @xmath6c / h . single crystals of @xmath1-gese were obtained by the vertical bridgman method . the polycrystalline @xmath1-gese was ground to a fine powder and filled in a carbon - coated quartz glass tube with a diameter of 5 mm .",

    "the surface of @xmath0-gese crystals was found to not bond well with silver paint and silver epoxy .",
    "therefore , indium bonding was employed instead .",

    "the observed relatively high but temperature independent resistivity of @xmath0-gese , compared to its calculated electronic structure showing that it should be a 0.5 ev semiconductor , suggests that the observed resistivity is dominated by defect - state conduction .",
