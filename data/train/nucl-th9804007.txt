    "the weak form factors @xmath33 are obtained using the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis , which requires @xmath34 and relates the remaining three form factors to the various amplitudes in the photo and electroproduction of the @xmath16 resonance . from the experimental data on these processes , the following values of the vector form factors are obtained , which are used in the analysis of the neutrino scattering experiments @xcite :    @xmath35    with @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the mass of @xmath2 resonance .",
    "the weak axial form factors @xmath38 are determined by fitting the available data on the differential cross section @xmath39 in neutrino scattering , mainly from the deuteron target , in order to minimize the nuclear corrections . however , these values of the form factors are also compatible with the data on neutrino scattering from nuclear targets@xcite . it is to be noted that @xmath40 is not determined from these experiments as it is proportional to the lepton mass , which is neglected in these analyses . instead , this form factor is determined in terms of @xmath4 using the hypothesis of pcac .",

    "when the reaction takes place in deuteron , i.e. @xmath64 , the differential cross section in the impulse approximation is calculated to be    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the deuteron mass and @xmath67 is the fourier transform of the deuteron radial wave function .",
    "this expression is derived assuming the neutron to be spectator , and neglecting meson exchange currents and final state interactions .",
    "the contribution of these effects on the differential cross section @xmath68 has been studied earlier for the case of the quasielastic reaction@xcite and found to be small in the kinematical region considered here .",
    "( 13 ) , we calculate the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath11 for various deuteron wave functions corresponding to hulthen @xcite , paris @xcite and bonn @xcite potentials , and compare them with the differential cross section results for the free case , calculated from eq .",
    "( 8) .    the results for @xmath69 as a function of @xmath70 for the incident neutrino energy @xmath71 gev are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the deuteron effects are small , not exceeding @xmath72 even at low @xmath73 i.e. @xmath74 gev@xmath15 .",
    "this is the region where they give a large reduction in the quasielastic reaction @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the different behaviour of deuteron effects in these two reactions is due to the nature of the vector current contribution . in the inelastic reaction",
    ", the vector contribution vanishes for proton as well as for deuteron targets in the limit of @xmath75 , and the only contribution is from the axial vector piece , which is only slightly affected by the deuteron structure . on the other hand , in the quasielastic reaction , while both vector and axial vector currents contribute for the nucleon case , the vector contribution is completely suppressed in the deuteron .",
    "the only contribution left in the case of deuteron is from the axial vector current with an effective strength , which is strongly reduced due to symmetry considerations of the two nucleons in the final state@xcite . in the range of @xmath76 gev@xmath15",
    "the deuteron effects are found to be quite small on the differential cross section @xmath68 for the inelastic reaction .",
    "the situation is then similar to the case of quasielastic reaction @xcite , where the deuteron effects are almost negligible in this region .",
    "we compare the deuteron structure effects in both reactions by computing the ratio @xmath77 defined as    @xmath78    and plotting it as a function of @xmath73 . in calculating @xmath77 , we use the deuteron wave function obtained from paris potential .",
    "the differential cross sections for the quasielastic reaction is taken from singh and arenhoevel@xcite for the case where meson exchange currents and final state interaction effects are neglected , in order to be consistent with our present calculation for the inelastic reaction . in fig .",
    "2 , we show @xmath77 for the range of low @xmath73 , where deuteron effects are known to be important in the case of quasielastic reactions .",
    "we also show in this figure the ratio for the equivalent reactions on the free nucleon .",
    "we see that the ratio of the two differential cross sections on the free nucleon target remains approximately constant for a large range of @xmath73 considered here . in the case of the deuteron target",
    "also the ratio @xmath77 is fairly constant for the values of @xmath79 gev@xmath15 .",
    "note that in the region of @xmath80 gev@xmath15 , the deuteron effects are always less than @xmath81 . for values of @xmath82 gev@xmath15 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath77 increases .",
    "this is mainly due to the decrease in the cross sections of the quasielastic reaction .    in the region of very low @xmath73 ,",
    "the nonzero muon mass may play a role . in order to see its effect ,",
    "we have evaluated the differential cross section @xmath69 from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , keeping the muon mass term and the induced pseudoscalar form factor @xmath83 , determined from the pcac condition and given by eq .",
    "we show our results in fig . 3 for the case of paris wave function .",
    "the effect of the nonzero muon mass is important in the region of very low @xmath73 and is to be noticed in a fast decrease of the differential cross section as @xmath73 decreases and reaches a value @xmath84 , below which the reaction is kinematically not allowed .",
    "in fact , in an earlier analysis of the brookhaven experiment @xcite , this trend is clearly visible ( see fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) but , as no cross sections are quoted in this experiment , a direct comparison with our present theoretical results can not be made .    finally , to conclude this section on the effect of deuteron structure in the reaction @xmath0",
    ", we would like to elaborate and extend the comments made by kitagaki _",
    "et al _ @xcite about these effects and state that , at @xmath71 gev :    * the effects of deuteron structure are small for all @xmath73 , even for @xmath74 gev@xmath15 , not exceeding @xmath85 .",
    "* there is an additional reduction in the cross sections in the region of @xmath86 gev@xmath15 due to the nonzero muon mass , which is about @xmath87 , and could be larger as @xmath73 decreases further .",
    "the analysis of schreiner and von hippel @xcite uses an s - wave width for the @xmath2 resonance , which has also been used in the anl and bnl experiments@xcite .",
    "the recent paper of hhm @xcite , dealing with the @xmath3 couplings and the extraction of @xmath4 , uses an expression for the differential cross section at @xmath88 , which neglects the width of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "in this situation , it seems worthwhile to examine the effect of the width of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "therefore , we study the sensitivity of the differential cross section for the process @xmath19 to the width of the @xmath2 resonance and its energy dependence . in order to do this , we evaluate the differential cross section given in eq .",

    "4 , we present the results of @xmath77 with free nucleon target for the three cases discussed above .",
    "we see here that the inclusion of the width gives a considerable reduction of the cross section , but the detailed form of its energy dependence is not very important when an invariant mass of @xmath92 gev is used .",
    "we have also found that the uncertainties in the width at the resonance energy of about @xmath93 mev @xcite do not lead to any substantial change in the cross section .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the value of @xmath4 using the data of kitagaki _ et al . _",

    "( 4 - 7 ) , we calculate the flux averaged differential cross section for the neutrino energy spectrum of the argonne experiment of radecky _",
    "_ @xcite and show this in fig .",
    "we see that the inclusion of deuteron and mass effects lead to a better description of the data .",
    "it is to be emphasized that a small reduction in the differential cross section due to these effects is quite important in bringing out a good agreement with the experimental data , specially in the low @xmath1 region .    in table 1 , we compare the values of these coupling constants with the theoretical values obtained in various models .",
    "with the exception of the quark model treatment of liu _ et al _ @xcite , all the quark models underestimate the value of @xmath4 when compared to the central values quoted from experimental analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "it is in good agreement with the prediction of pcac , which gives @xmath104 , when the experimental value of @xmath105@xcite is used .",
    "it is expected that the various extensions of the quark models currently proposed to explain the quadrupole moment of @xmath2 , and the e2/m1 ratio in the photo and electroproduction of the @xmath2 resonance will be applied to the problem of explaining @xmath4 and other @xmath106 couplings in these models .",
    "it is possible to get information about the axial vector coupling @xmath4 from the observation of the parity violating asymmetry in the polarized electron scattering experiments performed in the @xmath2 region .",
    "the feasibility of doing such experiments was discussed in past by many authors @xcite , but it seems now possible to do these experiments at the high intensity electron accelerators @xcite . in the neutral current reaction @xmath107 with polarized electron",
    "the asymmetry @xmath108 is defined as    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the differential cross section for an electron with helicity @xmath111 .",

    ", one can determine the value of @xmath115 from the asymmetry measurements by selecting the kinematics where nonresonant contributions are negligible .",
    "however , as we see from eq .",
    "( 22 ) , the hadronic axial vector current contribution containing @xmath4 is multiplied by a factor @xmath116 , which reduces the sensitivity of this term to the asymmetry @xmath117 .",

    "this requires very precise measurements of @xmath108 for a determination of @xmath4 from parity violating asymmetry measurements .",

    "is estimated to be @xmath123 cm@xmath15/gev@xmath15 . for an incident intensity of about @xmath125cm@xmath15/sec @xcite and @xmath73 bin of @xmath126 gev@xmath15",
    ", one would expect 72 events per hour for the production of @xmath127 , assuming @xmath128 efficiency of the detector .",
    "one third of these @xmath129 will produce negatively charged pions and protons , which can be easily observed . since in the region of @xmath130",
    ", @xmath4 gives the dominant contribution , its determination from the weak charged current experiment of @xmath16 production seems feasible .",
    "it is well known that , in the threshold region of photo and electro pion production from the nucleon , the matrix element of these processes in the soft pion limit is related with the nucleonic matrix element of the axial vector current using the methods of current algebra and the pcac .",
    "this relation has been exploited to obtain information about the axial vector form factor of the nucleon @xcite . in a similar way ,",
    "threshold pion production in the processes @xmath131 and @xmath132 is related , in the soft pion limit , with the @xmath3 transition matrix element of the axial vector current .",
    "the axial vector transition form factors can , in principle , be determined from these processes in the limit of soft pions .",
    "such attempts have been made in past and they yield @xmath133@xcite    however , in this case , the treatment of higher resonances and their effective couplings used for evaluating the matrix elements of the time ordered product of the vector and axial vector current operators occurring in the lsz reduction involve many approximations , which need further justification .",
    "recently , there has been some progress in calculating the contribution of higher resonances to the production of two pions in the photo and electroproduction processes using effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to isolate the dominant contributions from higher order resonances , which are relevant for the @xmath134 production in the soft pion limit .",
    "this will help to reduce the theoretical uncertainties in the application of the methods of pcac and current algebra to the processes where a @xmath2 resonance is produced .",
    "in addition , when dealing with the @xmath16 resonance , its width has to be properly taken into account as remarked by bartl _",
    "@xcite , and also shown by us in the weak charged current production of the @xmath16 resonance . the analysis of bartl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite uses the older data which suffers from poor statistics . when the results of a recent experiment proposed at tjnaf @xcite become available in near future",
    ", it will be possible to get precise information about the axial vector coupling @xmath4 and its momentum dependence .",
    "we have calculated the effect of deuteron structure and width of the @xmath2 resonance in the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath0 and find that these effects are small , but important in order to explain the experimental results at low @xmath1 , where they were initially expected to be important .",
    "furthermore , in the region of very low @xmath1 , the muon mass , which is usually neglected in the calculations , also reduces the cross section .",
    "the effect of the width of the @xmath2 resonance on the cross section is important and plays a crucial role in bringing out good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the detailed shape and 10 - 15% uncertainty in the width of the resonance does not affect the cross sections very much .",
    "the axial vector @xmath3 coupling @xmath4 is extracted from the bnl data on @xmath0 , incorporating the effect of the deuteron structure and the width of @xmath2 resonance .",
    "this value of @xmath4 is found to be larger than the values predicted in most of the quark models and is consistent with the prediction of pcac and adler s model .",
    "finally , we have discussed the possibility of determining this coupling from electron scattering experiments , and find that electroproduction and weak charged current of @xmath2 resonance are more suitable than asymmetry measurements in the polarized electroproduction of @xmath2 .",
