    "the slow rotation rates of low to intermediate mass ( @xmath10 ) pre - main - sequence stars remains one of the most important aspects of star formation that has , so far , resisted a generally accepted explanation . by the time they become optically visible as t tauri stars ( ttss ; *",
    "* ) , approximately half of them are observed to rotate at approximately 10% of breakup speed ( the  slow rotators  ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a surprise because many ttss ( the classical t tauri stars ; cttss ) are actively accreting material from surrounding keplerian disks @xcite . at a typical accretion rate of @xmath11 yr@xmath12 ,",
    "the angular momentum deposited by accreting disk material should spin up a ctts to near breakup speed in @xmath13 years @xcite . since the accretion phase lasts for @xmath14  @xmath15 years @xcite , since the stars accrete at much higher rates prior to the tts phase , and since the stars are still contracting @xcite , an efficient angular momentum loss mechanism is required to explain the existence of the slow rotators .    a few interesting and important ideas for explaining the tts slow rotators have been developed over the last two decades .",
    "these have resulted in the star - disk interaction model of @xcite , applied to cttss by ( * ? ? ? * and see @xcite ) , the x - wind model @xcite , and the idea that stellar winds provide strong torques @xcite . although both have advanced our understanding of the magnetic star - disk interaction , neither the ghosh & lamb nor x - wind models are without problems @xcite , and the idea that stellar winds are important has not yet been worked out in sufficient detail to compare to the other models .    in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  i ) , we further explored powerful stellar winds as a solution to the angular momentum problem and suggested that a fraction of the accretion power provides the energy necessary to drive the wind .",
    "we showed that stellar winds are capable of carrying off the accreted angular momentum , provided that @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is the outflow rate of material that is magnetically connected to the star ( the `` stellar wind '' ) .",
    "this analysis included a formulation for the stellar wind torque that contained the alfvn radius ( @xmath16 ) , which is not easily determined a priori in the wind , and the conclusions were based on a one - dimensional scaling estimate of this important physical quantity .",
    "thus , while it is clear that accretion - powered stellar winds ( apsws ) can in principle provide the necessary spin - down torque , this idea requires further development to produce a more detailed model .    toward this goal , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) used 2-dimensional ( axisymmetric ) magnetohydrodynamic simulations to solve for @xmath17 and calculate realistic stellar wind torques for a range of parameters . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the stellar wind solutions of paper  ii to compare the stellar wind torque to the torques expected to arise from the star - disk interaction .",
    "furthermore , we find new solutions for stellar spins , based upon torque balance between the accretion torque and the apsw spin - down torque .",
    "this paper begins with a brief description of the simulation results of paper  ii (  [ sec_simulations ] ) .",
    "we then compare the stellar wind torque to the star - disk spin - down torque in section [ sec_tdsd ] and then to the star - disk spin - up torque in section [ sec_equilibrium ] , which contains spin - equilibrium solutions .",
    "section [ sec_discussion ] contains a summary and discussion .",
    "this section contains a brief description of the simulation results of paper  ii that we will use for our analysis , and the reader will find details in that paper .",
    "the primary purpose of the simulations was to compute the spin - down torque on a star , due to the angular momentum outflow in a wind .",
    "we used numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations to directly calculate the torque @xmath18 from steady - state , 2d ( axisymmetric ) winds from isolated stars .",
    "we adopted coronal ( thermal - pressure - driven ) winds as a proxy for the unknown wind driving mechanism . in the simulations , the torque is entirely determined by the seven key parameters listed in table [ tab_parms ] .",
    "these are the stellar mass , @xmath19 ; stellar radius , @xmath6 ; strength of the rotation - axis - aligned dipole magnetic field at the surface and equator of the star , @xmath5 ; spin rate expressed as a fraction of breakup speed , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular spin rate of the star ; mass outflow rate in the stellar wind , @xmath3 ; ratio of the thermal sound speed to the escape speed , evaluated at the base of the wind ( just above the stellar surface ) , @xmath22 ; and adiabatic index , @xmath23 .",

    "paper  ii contained a parameter study in which each of the seven parameters were varied relative to the fiducial case , and 14 cases from the parameter study are listed in table [ tab_torques ] ) . ] . in each case , six of the parameters were held fixed at the fiducial value ( as given in table [ tab_parms ] ) , and one parameter was varied as indicated by the first column of table [ tab_torques ] .",
    "to compare with analytic theory , we also calculated the effective alfvn radius ( @xmath17 ) , where the poloidal wind velocity equals the poloidal alfvn speed , using an analytic formula for the stellar wind torque , @xmath28 since our simulations are multi - dimensional , we have used @xmath29 , which is the mass - loss - weighted average of @xmath30 .",
    "hereafter , we ll refer to @xmath31 generically as @xmath17 . using the simulation result for @xmath18 ,",
    "equation [ eqn_tw ] defines the value of @xmath17 , which is tabulated for all cases in the second column of table [ tab_torques ] .    in this paper , we make use of the semi - analytic formulation for the alfvn radius from paper  ii , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are dimensionless constants fit to the simulation , and @xmath35 is the escape speed from the stellar surface .",
    "paper  ii showed that the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 well - describe ( to better than 1% ) the fiducial case and those eight other cases with variations on @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath19 .",
    "although this is only approximately valid for situations with different wind acceleration rates or different rotation rates ( in which case the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are slightly different ; see paper  ii ) , the formulation of equation [ eqn_rasim ] serves well as an indication of the approximate dependence of the stellar wind on parameters , which will be important for discussing a wide range of possible conditions .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) is similar to that derived by ( e.g. )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see @xcite ) for the general theory of centrifugally driven disk winds .",
    "the quantity in brackets measures the magnetization of the wind . by assuming that the alfvn speed @xmath38 ( at the alfvn radius ) is directly proportional to @xmath39 , a relation of the kind given by equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) can be derived ( e.g. , see equation 2.27 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    ", the value of the index is @xmath40 .",
    "while this value is not far from the results of our numerical simulations , the difference is significant .",
    "one key reason for this may be that disk winds are in the regime of so - called fast magnetic rotators , whereas the rather slowly rotating tts are either slow magnetic rotators ( where wind - driving forces dominate over centrifugal ones ) or are intermediate between these two regimes ( see paper  ii ) .    for the discussion that follows , it is useful to highlight how the lever arm ( @xmath17 ) and wind torque responds to changing the mass load ( the mass loss rate ) of the wind . the fact that the alfvn lever arm in a hydromagnetic wind gets smaller as the mass load of the outflow increases , as is seen in equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) , seems to suggest that the wind would become ineffective .",
    "this is certainly not true however , because equation ( [ eqn_tw ] ) assures that an increase in wind mass loss rate leads to a net increase in the torque that the wind exerts upon the star ( the net wind torque scales as @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is the basic reason why , by having an outflow rate that is a substantial fraction of the accretion rate , an accretion - powered stellar wind can be effective in countering the accretion torque .",

    "so we only consider here the cases from paper  ii with a dipole magnetic field .",
    "we also adopt the following assumptions .",
    "paper  ii indicated that the details of the wind driving have a relatively small , but not entirely negligible , effect on the stellar wind torque . in the absence of a detailed model for how apsws",
    "are driven , we assume that the velocity profile of an apsw does not differ substantially from our simulations ( paper  ii ) , so that the calculated torques are valid . secondly , paper  ii considered winds from isolated stars . here , we will use the computed torques to develop the apsw scenario , in which stellar winds are accompanied by disk winds , accretion flows , and the general star - disk interaction ( see figure 1 of paper  i ) . in reality , the accretion disk blocks a portion of the stellar wind , and it is not clear how much this will affect the stellar wind torque . for the present study , we will assume that the presence of the disk and accretion will not significantly influence the stellar wind torques as computed in paper  ii .",
    "the magnetic interaction between the star and disk results in angular momentum transfer between the two .",
    "all models that calculate the torque on the star from this interaction are based on the framework constructed by @xcite . in this general model ,",
    "some of the stellar magnetic dipole flux connects to the accretion disk and conveys torques between the star and disk .",
    "the net torque can be separated into a spin - up part that adds angular momentum to the star and a spin - down part that removes angular momentum from the star , giving it back to the disk . in the absence of a stellar wind ,",
    "a spin - down torque only arises when there is a magnetic connection between the star and the region of the disk outside the corotation radius , @xmath44 it is assumed that the disk is capable of transporting away the excess angular momentum it receives from the star .",
    "the goal of this section is to compare the stellar wind torque to the spin - down torque arising from the star - disk magnetic connection , to determine under which circumstances each of these torques may be important and aid in the angular momentum loss from the star .    to calculate the star - disk spin - down torque , @xmath45 , we follow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mp05b ) , who formulated a ghosh & lamb type model that includes the effect of the opening of magnetic field lines via the differential rotation between the star and disk . in this case , @xmath45 is calculated by considering only the magnetic flux that remains closed ( connected ) , parametrized as having an azimuthal twist of less than a critical angle , @xmath46 . here",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath47 suggested by @xcite . by combining equation ( 9 ) and ( 22 ) of mp05b with equation ( [ eqn_rco ] )",
    ", we find @xmath48 where @xmath49 % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a dimensionless function of the strength of the effective magnetic diffusion rate in the disk .",
    "this is parametrized by @xmath50 , which for a standard @xmath51-disk @xcite is @xmath50  @xmath52  @xmath53 , where @xmath51 has its usual meaning , @xmath54 is the disk scale height at radius @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the turbulent magnetic prandtl number has no relation to the usual `` plasma beta '' parameter that often appears in mhd studies . ] .",
    "small values of @xmath50 correspond to strong coupling , and mp05b suggested that @xmath57 was appropriate for real disks . for strong coupling ( small @xmath50 ) , the magnetic field will be highly twisted azimuthally , leading to more open flux and a weaker star - disk spin - down torque . for small @xmath50 , @xmath58 , but",
    "@xmath59 has a maximum value of 0.25 when @xmath60 ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "7 of mp05b ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqn_tdsd ] ) indicates that the star - disk spin - down torque is completely independent of the accretion rate .",
    "this torque only requires that there exists a keplerian disk outside @xmath61 , to which the star can connect , and it does not matter whether or not there is net accretion onto the star .",
    "the dependence on the stellar spin rate @xmath26 is due to the fact that when the star spins faster , @xmath61 is closer to the star , where the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "we compare the stellar wind torque computed in our simulations to the star - disk spin - down torque by listing the ratio @xmath62 in the last two columns of table [ tab_torques ] .",
    "we consider both a case with @xmath63 , resulting in @xmath64 , and a case with @xmath65 , resulting in @xmath66 .",
    "it is apparent that the simulated stellar wind torques are tens to hundreds of times greater than @xmath45 , the larger difference existing for smaller values of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for the simulated winds , we see empirically that the stellar wind is much more effective at spinning down the star than is the star - disk connection .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively as follows . in the stellar magnetosphere ,",
    "any torque on the star is primarily conveyed by the azimuthal twisting of its magnetic field . in the case of the magnetic field connecting the star to the disk , there is a limit to how much the magnetic field can be twisted before the connection is lost ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mp05b ) . in the case of a stellar wind flowing along the field",
    ", there is no such limit on the twist .",
    "the larger the mass outflow rate in the wind , the less capable is the magnetic field to keep wind material corotating with the star , and so the larger will be the twist of the field .    to show the dominance of the stellar wind torque more generally and to identify the circumstances under which it might not dominate , we will use the semi - analytic formulation of equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) . by combining equations ( [ eqn_f ] )  ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) , one obtains @xmath67 for the stellar wind torque . at first it may seem unusual that @xmath18 is weaker when the magnetic lever arm length , @xmath16 , is larger ( for fixed @xmath68 ) .",
    "however this simply indicates that the stellar wind torque increases with increasing @xmath69 , as noted in section [ sec_simulations ] . also , note that a weak @xmath26-dependence of @xmath17 is not characterized in equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) ( see paper  ii ) , so the exact dependence of the torque on @xmath26 is not captured in equation ( [ eqn_twind2 ] ) .    by combining equations ( [ eqn_tdsd ] ) and ( [ eqn_twind2 ] ) , using @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see  [ sec_simulations ] ) , one finds @xmath72 the lines in figure [ fig_torqueratio ] show equation ( [ eqn_ratio ] ) for @xmath73 and for three different values of @xmath50 .",
    "this includes a line for @xmath74 , which corresponds to the strongest possible star - disk spin - down torque ( as discussed by mp05b ) . even in this case , the fiducial stellar wind torque is @xmath75 times stronger than the star - disk spin - down torque . for smaller , more realistic values of @xmath50 ,",
    "the star - disk spin - down torque only becomes weaker , while the stellar wind torque is not affected .",
    "it is clear that for the parameters considered here , the angular momentum extracted by the stellar wind completely dominates over that which can be transferred from the star to the disk .",
    "the stellar wind torque becomes weaker relative to @xmath45 when @xmath17 is larger ( e.g. , for smaller @xmath3 ) or for more rapidly spinning stars ( larger @xmath26 ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath76 , favored by mp05b , @xmath18 will be larger than @xmath77 for a star with @xmath73 , as long as @xmath78 .",
    "this limiting value is much longer than any of the lever arm lengths listed in table [ tab_torques ] . as an example , for all else being equal to the fiducial case , equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) suggests that @xmath79 , as long as @xmath80  yr@xmath12 .",
    "this limit is comparable to the solar wind mass loss rate .",
    "if the stellar dipole field strength is instead @xmath81 kg , the limit becomes @xmath82 .",
    "the squares and triangles in figure [ fig_torqueratio ] represent the data from table [ tab_torques ] .",
    "note that nine of the data points ( for each @xmath50 ) match the line very well .",
    "this is expected since the results from these cases were used to obtain the value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 used in equation ( [ eqn_ratio ] ) .",
    "there are five cases ( for each @xmath50 ) that lie slightly off of the line .",
    "three of them represent the last three cases listed in table [ tab_torques ] , and the other two are the @xmath83 and @xmath84 cases ( which , for the plot , we have scaled by a factor of @xmath85 , to take into account the spin dependence of equation ( [ eqn_ratio ] ) ) .",
    "these five cases are not expected to match exactly since equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) is not precise for cases with different wind driving or spin rates than the fiducial case ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "thus , the scatter of these five cases around the line indicates a sort of uncertainty of the semi - analytic formula for the stellar wind , due to variations in the wind driving mechanism and stellar spin rate .",
    "it is evident from the figure that this uncertainty does not affect the main conclusion here that stellar wind torques dominate the spin down of the star .",
    "thus , for the slow rotators ( @xmath86 ) , we conclude that a stellar wind will transport much more angular momentum from the star than will a magnetic connection to the disk , as long as the stellar wind mass outflow rate is substantially larger than the solar wind mass outflow rate . for the systems considered here , with @xmath87  yr@xmath12",
    ", the stellar wind torque completely dominates over any other spin - down torque felt by the star . since @xmath45 is negligible , the only important torques on these stars are the spin - down torque from the stellar wind and the spin - up portion of the star - disk interaction torque .",
    "we compare these two torques in the following section .",
    "section [ sec_tdsd ] revealed that , for the slow rotators with substantial stellar winds , the spin - down torque felt by the star from the star - disk interaction is negligible .",
    "thus , the spin state of the star is characterized as a competition between the spin - up component of the star - disk interaction torque and the spin - down by the stellar wind .",
    "if a system s parameters are measured , the theory can be used to determine the net torque on the star .    given enough time ( @xmath88@xmath14 yr for cttss ) , the stellar spin should approach an equilibrium spin state in which the net torque on the star is zero ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the variability observed in accreting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that spin equilibrium may only represent a time - averaged state , and the condition of net zero torque simply identifies where the net torque changes sign . in any case , it is instructive to examine the conditions of spin - equilibrium .    in sections [ sec_balancing ]  [ sec_power ] , we examine the expected spin - equilibrium state of the specific cases of stellar winds simulated in paper  ii . in section [ sec_semianalytic ] ,",
    "we use the semi - analytic formulation of equation [ eqn_rasim ] to make more general conclusions .",
    "the spin - up portion of the star - disk interaction torque comes primarily from the accretion of material from the innermost part of the disk onto the star . in this section ,",
    "we examine some specific cases of spin equilibrium , by determining under what conditions this spin - up torque balances the stellar wind torques for the simulations listed in table [ tab_torques ] .    when a star s magnetic field is strong enough",
    ", it will disrupt the keplerian disk at some radius , @xmath89 , the disk truncation radius .",
    "we calculate the location of @xmath89 using the method and equations contained in the appendix , which follows mp05b . from @xmath89 ,",
    "accreting material is channeled by the magnetic field to the surface of the star .",
    "there is a torque associated with the truncation of the disk and the accretion of material from @xmath89 .",
    "this torque , hereafter the `` accretion torque , '' is given by mp05b as @xmath90 , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the mass accretion rate onto the stellar surface and @xmath91 is the normalized radius of gyration of the star ( we assume @xmath92 ; @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqn_ta ] ) assumes that all of the keplerian specific angular momentum of the disk material near @xmath89 is transferred to the star .",
    "this naturally follows from the dynamical truncation of the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; mp05b ) and is supported by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that the accretion torque depends both on @xmath4 and @xmath89 . at the same time , as shown in the appendix , the location of @xmath89 itself depends on most of the parameters , including @xmath4 and @xmath50 .",

    "this indicates that , as discussed by paper  i and ii ( and see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these winds are in a regime where the magnetocentrifugal effects are of nearly equal importance with the other source of wind driving .",
    "it is this other source of wind driving that we propose is powered by some fraction of the available accretion energy .",
    "we define this fraction as in paper  i , which assumes thermal wind driving .",

    "@xmath115 this represents the minimum fraction of the accretion power required to drive the stellar wind , since whatever mechanism drives the wind will not itself likely be 100% efficient @xcite .",

    "in the apsw scenario , some of the accretion power drives the stellar wind , so only a fraction @xmath118 of the accretion power can be radiated .",
    "this means that the true accretion rate ( @xmath4 ) will be a factor of @xmath119 larger than the observationally determined value . in this context , and since @xmath114 is the miminum required fraction to drive the wind , a value of @xmath120 ( as for several cases listed in tables [ tab_equilib0.1 ] and [ tab_equilib0.01 ] ) appears quite large . however , the observational determination of @xmath4 is uncertain by a factor of several , as exemplified by the large range of measurements compiled by @xcite .",

    "in reality , the physics of the energy coupling will likely determine the value of @xmath114 , which effectively sets the value for @xmath123 .",
    "then , given enough time , the stellar spin rate will evolve toward the equilibrium value set primarily by @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus the spin - equilibrium state of the star is ultimately determined by the power coupling and magnetic properties , and more work is needed to take this further .      in order to develop a more general , predictive theory , in this section we make use of the semi - analytic formulation of equation ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) . as justified by the previous sections , we assume that the equilibrium spin rate of the star is simply determined by a balance between the spin - up torque from accretion and the spin - down torque from the stellar wind . using equations ( [ eqn_f ] )  ( [ eqn_rasim ] ) , ( [ eqn_ta ] ) , and ( [ eqn_teq ] ) , we can write the stellar wind equilibrium spin rate , expressed as a fraction of breakup spin , as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a dimensionless magnetization parameter is related to @xmath127 used by mp05b ( see their eq .",

    "equation ( [ eqn_fsw ] ) includes a dependence on the truncation radius of the disk , @xmath89 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we have further developed the accretion - powered stellar wind model proposed in paper  i , where the stellar wind magnetic lever arm length , @xmath17 , was taken as a parameter to determine the stellar wind torque .",
    "we employed the simulation results of paper  ii ( see  [ sec_simulations ] ) to obtain stellar wind torques for several cases representative of t tauri systems .",
    "we examined the total torque on the star arising from the stellar wind plus the magnetic interaction between the star and its accretion disk .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we found that the spin - down torque from a stellar wind can be orders of magnitude stronger than the spin - down portion of the star - disk interaction torque , for slowly rotating stars with mass loss rates substantially larger than the solar wind outflow rate ( see  [ sec_tdsd ] ) .",
    "this confirms the assumption of paper  i that the condition for net zero torque on the star ( spin equilibrium ) is simply determined by a balance between the stellar wind torque and the accretion torque .",
    "2 .   using the computed stellar wind torques for several cases , we looked at the conditions for spin equilibrium (  [ sec_balancing ] ) .",
    "we found that a rotation rate of 10% of breakup speed typically requires @xmath123 equal a few tens of percent , confirming the original suggestion by @xcite that stellar winds may be capable of removing accreted angular momentum .",
    "3 .   for most cases in spin equilibrium ,",
    "the disk truncation radius was very close to the corotation radius , though this is not a general requirement of the apsw model (  [ sec_state ] ) .",
    "accretion power is generally sufficient to power a stellar wind that is capable of solving the angular momentum problem (  [ sec_power ] ) , as suggested in paper  i. the energy requirements for most of the cases considered here is relatively large , and more work is needed to further constrain the energy coupling .",
    "5 .   under the assumption that the stellar wind is accretion powered , the cases we examined suggested a hard upper limit of @xmath143 . 6 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_semianalytic ] we used the results from paper  ii to derive a semi - analytic formulation for the equilibrium spin rate predicted by the apsw model .",
    "we found the that spin rate , expressed as a fraction of breakup speed , generally depends only on the two dimensionless parameters @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the apsw model incorporates several previous ideas . as in all other models that emphasize the role of stellar magnetic fields , the interaction of the magnetized star with the disk leads to the truncation of the disk and accretion of material along field lines onto the star .",
    "the apsw model adopts the finding of the ghosh & lamb - type models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is also supported by numerical simulations @xcite , that the angular momentum of accreting material is transferred to the star .",
    "however , in contrast to the ghosh & lamb - type models , we found that for slow rotators , any spin - down torque arising from the star - disk interaction is negligible ( item 1 above ) .",
    "instead , the stellar spin - up torque from accretion is counteracted by an accretion - driven stellar wind , which carries a comparable amount of angular momentum out of the system .",
    "compared to all existing models , apsw is distinct in that it conceptually links the driving of the stellar wind to the energy released by the accretion process ( via @xmath104 ) . in other ways ,",
    "the general picture of apsw is similar to other angular momentum models that utilize winds . in particular ,",
    "the x - wind @xcite , the reconnection x - wind @xcite , and other works considering stellar winds @xcite all find that , in order to carry away significant angular momentum , the mass outflow rate needs to be of the order of 10% of the accretion rate ( item 2 above ) . except for the x - wind , in all of the above scenarios ,",
    "the outflow is magnetically connected to the star , and thus extracts angular momentum directly from the star . by contrast",
    ", the x - wind outflow is magnetically connected to the disk .",
    "furthermore , the x - wind is unique in that it assumes that the accretion of material does not deposit angular momentum onto the star .",
    "as mentioned in item 3 above , for most of the specific cases of our simulated winds , we found that in the spin equilibrium state , the truncation radius was very close to the corotation radius .",
    "this is similar to the prediction of the disk locking models , which includes both the ghosh & lamb - type models and the x - wind .",
    "however , in contrast with the disk locking models , it is not a requirement of apsw that @xmath89 be close to @xmath61 .",
    "measurements of the location of the inner edge of the gas disk @xcite suggest that @xmath89/@xmath61 is typically @xmath146% .",
    "we leave a more detailed comparison between models for future work .",
    "there is observational evidence that the outflow rates from accreting young stellar systems are of the order of 10% of the accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are therefore accretion powered @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that a large fraction of this flow ( which is usually probed by forbidden emission coming from large spatial scales ) originates in the disk , rather than the star @xcite .",

    "the predictions of the spin equilibrium state can also be checked observationally @xcite .",
    "this will likely require large samples of stars , due to large uncertainties in measured parameters , and since intrinsic variability in real systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) may only allow a spin equilibrium state to be achieved in a time - averaged sense .",
    "the ghosh & lamb , x - wind , and apsw models all predict an equilibrium spin rate that depends on @xmath132 , but of these three , only the apsw model contains an additional dependence on the stellar wind mass outflow rate . for",
