    "the system of three identical bosons having a large two - body scattering length has been the subject of intense investigations in recent years . as shown by efimov in a sequence of papers  @xcite ,",
    "the three - body spectrum consists of an infinite number of states that accumulate to zero with the ratio between two consecutive states being @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , in the limit @xmath5 the two - body system shows a continuous scale invariance that is broken in the @xmath6-wave three - body sector of a bosonic system .",
    "the residual symmetry is the discrete scale invariance ( dsi ) ; namely , the physics is invariant under the rescaling @xmath7 , where the constant is usually written @xmath8 , with @xmath9 an universal number that characterises a system of three - identical bosons .",
    "the dsi constrains the form of the observables to be log - periodic functions of the control parameters .",

    "it is well known that for @xmath19 the effective range function satisfies the limit @xmath20 , which implies that at @xmath21 the constants @xmath11 and @xmath22 are related by simple trigonometric relations .",
    "a parametrization of the universal constants and functions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dsi also constrains the form of the @xmath1-matrix for collisions above the dimer threshold , leading to the following peculiar form for the recombination rate at threshold  @xcite @xmath23}\\frac{\\hbar a^4}{m}\\ , , \\label{eq : recomb}\\ ] ] that , using the large value of the factor @xmath24 , can be approximated by @xmath25 a^4\\hbar / m \\ , ,     \\label{eq : recombsine}\\ ] ] where @xmath26  @xcite .    in this work we study in detail the universal behavior of @xmath27 by solving the schrdinger equation for a family of attractive two - body gaussian potentials describing the he - he system .",
    "these potentials are constructed to reproduce the two - body binding energy @xmath28 , the two - body scattering length @xmath0 and the effective range @xmath29 of the lm2m2 potential , widely used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the variation of the potential strength produces different values of the scattering length @xmath0 allowing a comparison of the recombination rate given by eq.([eq : recomb ] ) .",
    "the model includes a three - body interaction necessary to tune the trimer energy of the lm2m2 potential .",
    "this procedure is equivalent , up to range corrections , to the implementation of effective field theory ( eft ) at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "this strategy has been used before in the study of the atom - dimer effective range function @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the zero - range formula of eq.([eq : cotdelta ] ) has to be modified in order to describe results obtained through the solution of the schrdinger equation using finite - range potentials .",
    "the modification consists in a shift on the variable @xmath31 , and in the replacement of @xmath30 by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is related to the two - body binding energy through @xmath34 . in the present analysis",
    "we find that the same type of modification has to be made in order to describe the numerical results .",
    "the universal character of eq.([eq : recomb ] ) allows its application to very different systems .",
    "here we extend the study on atomic systems to describe a nuclear system : the neutron - neutron - proton recombination rate close to threshold .",
    "this study is twofold ; from one side , we would like to confirm that systems whose energies and sizes differ by several order of magnitude are still described by the same universal equation . on the other hand",
    ", very low energy recombination in nuclear systems can be achieved in stars , and the present study can therefore be applied to those systems in which the three - body structure is dominant , e.g. , neutron - neutron - core systems .",
    "as an example we can mention the recently performed studies in recombination of @xmath35h  @xcite and low energy @xmath36c collisions  @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that in cold - atom physics the search for universal behavior is a very active sector of research . at present",
    ", there is an intense experimental activity to study efimov physics in trapped ultracold gases . in these systems",
    "the recombination rate has a major importance , being the main loss mechanism .",
    "three different values of the two - body scattering length have relevance : @xmath37 , which characterizes the threshold where the trimer disappears into the three - atom continuum , @xmath38 , which characterizes the threshold where the trimer disappears into the atom - dimer continuum , and @xmath39 , which characterizes a minimum in the recombination rate .",
    "discrepancies are found between the zero - range theoretical predictions and experimental determinations of these three quantities  @xcite . to this respect ,",
    "we would like to see if the quantities obtained from the calculations using finite range potentials are in better agreement with the experimental predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the two - body and three - body potential models are introduced and the results for the first two energy levels are discussed .",
    "the main results of this work are given in section iii , which is divided into four subsections dedicated to analyze the elastic and breakup cross sections , the recombination and dissociation rates , comparison of the results to experimental data and nucleon - deuteron scattering above threshold .",
    "the conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "in this section we study universal aspects of a three - boson system by taking the three - helium system as reference . at the two - body level , we consider one of the most commonly used he - he potentials , i.e. , the lm2m2 interaction  @xcite , which is taken as the reference interaction . in particular , in order to explore the @xmath40 plane ( @xmath41^{1/2}]$ ] and @xmath42 the energy level ) , we modify this potential as : @xmath43    examples of this strategy exist in the literature  @xcite . for @xmath44",

    "as it is well known , the adiabatic expansion method is a very powerful method used to describe bound states  @xcite .",
    "however , the extension to describe scattering states encountered some difficulties , in particular in the case of atom - dimer elastic scattering .",
    "the problem arose from the difference between the set of coordinates in which the process has a natural asymptotic description ( the usual jacobi coordinates ) and the expansion in terms of hyperradial functions which produced a low rate of convergence . in order to circumvent the problem ,",
    "two integral relations have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and already applied several times in the literature  @xcite .",

    "@xcite for details ) . the @xmath121-matrix is then given by the product @xmath122 .",

    "obviously , the closer the inelasticity to 1 the more elastic the reaction . in fact , for energies below the breakup threshold the phase - shift is real and @xmath131 .     for two different values of @xmath31 ; in the upper panel @xmath132 , and in the lower panel @xmath133 .",

    "the conclusion was that the use of the integral relations produces a pattern of convergence similar to a bound - state calculation .",
