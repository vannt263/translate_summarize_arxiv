    "it is well - known from freeman s ( 1970 ) work that the radial light distribution of the stellar component of high surface brightness galactic discs can be approximated by an exponential law of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the luminosity density in the galactic centre , _ r _ the galactocentric distance and @xmath2 the disc scalelength .",
    "however , for a few prominent high surface - brightness edge - on galaxies , it has initially been shown by van der kruit & searle ( 1981a , b , 1982a , b , hereinafter ks14 ) , that at some radius @xmath3 ( the truncation or cut - off radius of the galactic disc ) the stellar luminosity distribution disappears asymptotically into the background noise ( see also jensen & thuan 1982 , sasaki 1987 , morrison , boroson & harding 1994 , bottema 1995 , lequeux , dantel - fort & fort 1995 , nslund & jrster 1997 , fry et al .",

    "2000a , b ) . in fact",
    ", the truncation of galactic discs does not occur instantly but over a small region , where the luminosity decrease becomes much steeper , having exponential scalelengths of order or less than a kiloparsec , opposed to several kpc in the exponential disc part ( e.g. , ks14 , jensen & thuan 1982 , sasaki 1987 , abe et al .",

    "an independent approach to obtain the statistics of truncated galactic discs , using a sample of galaxies selected in a uniform way , is needed in order to better understand the overall properties and physical implications of this feature . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of a systematic analysis of disc truncations for a pilot sample of four `` normal '' spiral galaxies , drawn from the statistically complete sample of edge - on disc - dominated galaxies of de grijs ( 1998 ) . in kregel ,",
    "van der kruit & de grijs ( 2001 ) we will present a re - analysis of the global disc structures of the entire de grijs ( 1998 ) sample , including a systematic analysis of the occurrence of truncated galactic discs .    edge - on galaxies are particularly useful for the study of truncated galactic discs : since these disc cut - offs usually occur at very low surface brightness levels , they are more readily detected in highly inclined galaxies , where we can follow the light distributions out to larger radii . in sect .",
    "[ technical.sect ] we outline the sample selection and our approach and methodology .    a detailed error discussion for our pilot sample is given in sect .",
    "[ results.sect ] . the most important science driver for the study of truncated galactic discs , discussed in sect .",
    "[ dynamics.sect ] , is that if the truncations seen in the stellar light are also present in the mass distribution , they would have important dynamical consequences at the disc s outer edges .",
    "we selected four galaxies from the statistically complete sample of disc - dominated edge - on galaxies of de grijs ( 1998 ) for this pilot study .",
    "the galaxies in the parent sample were selected to :    * have inclinations @xmath4 ; * have blue angular diameters @xmath5 ; and * be non - interacting and undisturbed s0  sd galaxies .",
    "we required these pilot galaxies to have relatively high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios out to large galactocentric distances , thus allowing us to better determine the occurrence of a possible truncated disc at large radii .",
    "of the parent sample of 48 edge - on disc galaxies , @xmath6 met our overall high - s / n selection criteria in _ all _ of the _ b , v _ and _ i _ observations .",
    "the four galaxies selected for our pilot sample were chosen randomly from among the larger disc galaxies because of their small bulge - to - disc ratio and well - defined , regular disc component , which was only negligibly or minimally affected by a central dust lane ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 in chapter 9 of de grijs 1997 ) .",
    "the basic physical properties of these pilot sample galaxies are summarised in table [ pilot.tab ] .",
    "the observational properties were taken from de grijs ( 1997 , 1998 ) . the derived properties are obtained in sect .",

    "they are based on the detailed modelling of the galactic luminosity density distributions projected on the plane of the sky using the method described in kregel et al .",
    "the detailed observational logs of and data reduction techniques applied to our _ b , v _ and _ i_-band observations are summarised in de grijs ( 1998 ) .",
    "[ contours.fig ] displays the _",
    "i_-band contours of these galaxies .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      disc truncations do not necessarily occur at the same galactocentric distances or with the same abruptness on either side ( e.g. , ks1 , jensen & thuan 1982 , nslund & jrster 1997 , abe et al . 1999 ,",
    "fry et al . 1999 ) . in most cases",
    ", however , the truncation radii on either side of the galactic disc occur within @xmath7% of each other . the profiles in figs .",
    "[ cutoffs.fig ] and [ iband.fig ] , and our estimates for @xmath3 in table [ rmax.tab ] show that in general , the discs of our sample galaxies are truncated at similar radii , within their observational uncertainties , with the possible exception of eso 201-g22 .",
    "table [ rmax.tab ] also contains our best estimates for the exponential scalelength in the truncation region , @xmath8 . to measure this scalelength , we defined the inner fitting radius as the radius where the radial surface brightness profile starts to deviate significantly from the model radial exponential light distribution ( cf .",
    "barteldrees & dettmar 1994 ) ; the uncertainty in this radius is generally @xmath9% , depending on the particular galaxy considered . as outer fitting boundary we used @xmath3 .",
    "the errors associated with @xmath8 are observational uncertainties , obtained from the comparison of several similar fits in which we adjusted the inner boundary of the radial fitting range by 1020% . the uncertainties in @xmath3 are included in the observational errors given ;",
    "the formal errors were @xmath10% .",
    "the effects on disc truncations and scale parameters of an inclination @xmath11 are negligible for our galaxy sample of @xmath4 inclined galaxies , as was convincingly shown by barteldrees & dettmar ( 1994 ) , in particular in view of the systematic and observational uncertainties involved .",
    "the combination of @xmath8 and @xmath12 gives us an indication of the asymmetry and sharpness of the actual disc truncations .",
    "considering the relatively large systematic and observational errors that can not be avoided at this point , we can not claim that we detect any systematic asymmetries , perhaps with the exception of eso 416-g25 .",
    "the northern edge of the disc of eso 416-g25 is very sharply truncated compared to its southern edge . upon close examination of the actual ccd images",
    ", we believe that this may be explained by the fact that we likely observe the outer stellar envelope of a spiral arm , whereas on the southern side we are looking into the inside of a spiral arm .",
    "note , however , that also at the southern edge of the disc a clear truncation signature is observed ( fig .",
    "[ cutoffs.fig ] ) .",
    "the last two columns of table [ rmax.tab ] show that in none of our sample galaxies the radial scalelength in the truncation region decreases to values of order or less than 1 kpc . using @xmath13 km",
    "s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , or other values closer to the current best estimate , will further increase the truncation scalelengths measured in our galaxies .",
    "although two of our sample galaxies may not be exactly edge - on , their inclinations are sufficiently close to 90@xmath15 so as not to increase the measurements of @xmath8 by more than their observational uncertainties ( cf . barteldrees & dettmar 1994 ) .",
    "we are therefore forced to conclude that , although our discs are clearly truncated , the truncation occurs over a larger region and not as abruptly as found in previous studies .    as a comparison between our approach and that used in previous work , in fig .",
    "[ iband.fig ] we present enlarged versions of the _",
    "i_-band profiles of fig .",
    "[ cutoffs.fig ] , in which we show both our best - fit radial profiles using a slightly modified casertano model ( sect .",
    "[ 3dmodel.sect ] ; thin solid lines ) and the corresponding profiles for a symmetric , projected , sharply truncated exponential disc , with the disc truncations occurring at @xmath3 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "these profiles were obtained by applying the same method used to extract the observed profiles used for fig .",
    "[ cutoffs.fig ] to model images of our sample galaxies . from a comparison between these dotted lines and the actual , observed profiles ,",
    "it is clear that the discs of our sample galaxies are generally _ not infinitely sharply truncated _ , but show a more gradual decrease of their radial luminosity density .",
    "finally , from a galaxy - by - galaxy inspection of the values for @xmath16 , no apparent trend with wavelength can be discerned , within the observational errors . however",
    ", a detailed comparison of the radial @xmath17 colour profiles , our longest colour baseline , reveals that the disc colour tends to get bluer in the truncation region compared to the colours in the main disc ( fig .",
    "[ truncolors.fig ] ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained by sasaki ( 1987 ) for the truncation region of ngc 5907 .",
    "although this may be indicative of more recent star formation at the edge of the discs ( e.g. , larson 1976 , seiden et al .",
    "1984 ) , the opposite behaviour is exhibited both on the northern side of the disc of eso 416-g25 , and on the western side of the disc of eso 446-g44 , where the colour reddens in the truncation region .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that at these edges , these discs appear to be more sharply truncated in the _ b _ band compared to the _",
    "i-_band observations , which may be the signature of a spiral arm .",
    "although the fact that many spiral discs seem to have truncated stellar discs is an interesting observation in the context of galactic structure , the physical implications of a similar truncation in the mass distribution of galactic discs has far - reaching consequences making the study of disc truncations fundamental to our understanding of galactic disc maintenance and evolution .",
    "this is therefore the main science driver of our attempts to define a unique and objective method to measure disc truncations .",
    "the persistence of sharp disc cut - offs places a strong upper limit on the stellar velocity dispersion at the disc edge ( ks1 ) .",
    "adopting a rotational velocity of 250 km s@xmath14 at 20 kpc for ngc 4565 , the radial stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath18 , must be @xmath19 km s@xmath14 so that random motions do not wash out the sharp cut - off within one revolution time ( jensen & thuan 1982 ; see also ks1 , may & james 1984 ) , or the sharp cut - off must be a transient feature ( e.g. , sasaki 1987 ) . this low upper limit for @xmath20 is close to the minimum value of @xmath21 km s@xmath14 needed to satisfy toomre s ( 1964 ) criterion of local stability for disc galaxies , and thus for star formation .",
    "alternatively , in the case of a disc formation scenario in which the disc grows from the inside outward ( e.g. , larson 1976 , gunn 1982 , seiden 1983 , seiden et al .",
    "1984 ) a sharp edge can be maintained if this outward growth is sufficiently rapid , so that the random motion of the stars does not smear out the edge .",
    "note , however , that the disc truncations in our sample galaxies are not as sharp as those found by ks14 , among others , which will relax these requirements .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated if the galactic disc is lopsided or if the truncations occur at different radii .",
    "following the epicyclic description of baldwin , lynden - bell & sancisi ( 1980 ) , van der kruit ( 1988 ) estimates a smearing time of @xmath22 yr for the galactic disc , and he concludes that a variation in the truncation radii of order 10% may just survive a hubble time . with the possible exception of eso 416-g25",
    ", our sample galaxies appear to comfortably meet this requirement .",
    "casertano ( 1983 ) has shown that a truncated stellar disc leaves a signature on the rotation curve in the form of a region of slowly varying velocity followed by a steep decline just outside the truncation radius ( see also hunter , ball & gottesman 1984 ) .",
    "the amount of this decrease is a measure of the disc mass .",
    "the effect of a truncation is a _ flattening _ of the rotation curve inside the truncation itself , from some radius @xmath23 to @xmath3 , and a steep decrease of the velocity outside .",
    "the well - known warped edge - on galaxy ngc 4013 , for which bottema ( 1995 ) suspected a sudden decrease in the mass density corresponding to the truncation radius , has indeed been shown to exhibit a sudden drop in the rotational velocity of about 20 km s@xmath14 just at the optical edge ( bottema , shostak & van der kruit 1987 , bottema 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "this drop can be understood if one realises that near the edge of the galactic disc the mass distribution will be irregular : there is no smooth , circular end to the disc , but it likely ends in spiral arms . bottema ( 1996 ) argues that therefore gas moving in the potential of such patches of stellar matter will not be in precise circular motion and hence the radial velocity along the line of sight is somewhat lower than the true rotation .    finally , bahcall ( 1983 ) showed that , for sb or sc galaxies like ngc 891 or the galaxy , the feature in the rotation curve due to the truncated stellar disc is observable only if @xmath24 ( smaller for galaxies with more prominent bulges ) , if the truncation length is small compared to @xmath2 , and if the halo mass inside @xmath3 is smaller than the disc mass ( casertano 1983 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the currently available velocity information for the four galaxies in our pilot sample does not allow us to confirm the presence of sharp truncations in the disc mass based on the shape of the rotation curves : only for eso 446-g18 and eso 446-g44 rotation curves have been published , for the h@xmath25 emission ( mathewson et al .",
    "1992 ) and the hi component ( persic & salucci 1995 , based on the raw mathewson et al .",
    "1992 data ) , but these rotation curves do not or just barely reach those radii where we expect to be able to see a truncation signature .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first results of a systematic analysis of galactic disc structure in general and of radially truncated exponential discs in particular for a pilot sample of four `` normal '' disc - dominated edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "we have carefully considered the importance of ( residual ) dust , deviations from 90@xmath15 inclinations , and spiral arms , and concluded that these effects do not affect our results significantly .",
    "we have also shown that the truncated discs in our sample galaxies are not caused artificially by inaccurate sky subtraction , but are real deviations from the radial exponential light profiles .    an independent approach to obtain the statistics of truncated galactic discs , using a sample of galaxies selected in a uniform way , is needed in order to better understand their overall properties and physical implications . if the truncations seen in the stellar light are also present in the mass distribution , they would have important dynamical consequences at the disc s outer edges .",
    "we have shown that the truncated luminosity distributions of our pilot sample galaxies , if also present in the mass distributions , comfortably meet the requirements for longevity .",
    "the truncation radii , expressed in units of @xmath2 , for the discs of eso 201-g22 , eso 416-g25 , and eso 446-g18 are comparable to those found by ks14 and bottema ( 1995 ) , while eso 446-g44 is truncated at much smaller radii .",
    "in fact , the truncations of the discs of eso 416-g25 and eso 446-g44 are within the range found by pohlen et al .",
    "( 2000a ) for their sample of 31 nearby edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "in general , the discs of our sample galaxies are truncated at similar radii on either side of their centres , within the observational uncertainties , with the exception of eso 201-g22 .    with the possible exception of the disc of eso 416-g25",
    ", it appears that our sample galaxies are fairly symmetric , in terms of both the sharpness of their disc truncations and the truncation length , although the truncations occur over a larger region and not as abruptly as found in previous studies .",
    "the northern edge of the disc of eso 416-g25 is very sharply truncated compared to its southern edge .",
    "we believe that this may be explained by the fact that we likely observe the outer stellar envelope of a spiral arm , whereas on the southern side we are looking into the inside of a spiral arm .",
