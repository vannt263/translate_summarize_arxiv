    "in this paper and its two companion papers @xcite the relation of the electrons of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model to the quantum objects whose occupancy configurations describe its energy eigenstates is investigated for the whole hilbert space .",
    "the study of such a non - perturbative relation is a necessary step for the description of the finite - energy few - electron spectral properties of the many - electron quantum problem .",
    "the study of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model @xcite for interacting electrons is of general importance because the understanding of correlated systems and of their finite - energy excitations is still far from complete .",
    "the problem of the 1d hubbard model in the limit of large and infinite on - site coulomb repulsion was previously studied in the literature by many authors @xcite .",
    "our studies of the model for finite values of the on - site repulsion @xmath3 are motivated by the anomalous one - electron and two - electron spectral properties observed in metallic and insulating phases of quasi - one - dimensional materials , which can not be described by the usual fermi - liquid theory @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a renewed experimental interest on the properties of these materials @xcite .",
    "some of these experimental studies observed unusual finite - energy / frequency spectral properties @xcite . since in the case of finite - excitation energy",
    "the luttinger liquid description does not apply @xcite , these finite - energy / frequency spectral properties are far from being well understood . however , there are indications that electronic correlation effects might play an important role in the finite - energy physics of these low - dimensional materials @xcite",
    ". for low values of the excitation energy the microscopic electronic properties of these materials are usually described by systems of coupled chains . on the other hand , for finite values of the excitation energy larger than the transfer integrals for electron hopping between the chains , 1d lattice models taking into account the screened electron - electron coulomb repulsion",
    "are expected to provide a good description of the physics of these materials .",
    "the simplest of these models is the above 1d hubbard model @xcite , which describes such electron - electron interactions by an effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 .",
    "this model corresponds to a non - perturbative electronic problem . according to the results of the companion paper @xcite ,",
    "its energy eigenstates can be described by occupancy configurations of holons , spinons , and @xmath2 pseudoparticles .",
    "holons and spinons has also been studied for other models @xcite . the 1d hubbard model is often considered a suitable model for the description of the electronic correlation effects and the non - perturbative microscopic mechanisms behind the unusual few - electron spectral properties observed in quasi - one - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent angle - resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy revealed very similar spectral fingerprints from both high-@xmath4 superconductors and quasi - one - dimensional compounds @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the ultraviolet data for these two different systems could be evidence of the occurrence of a charge - spin separation associated with holons and spinons .",
    "the anomalous temperature dependence of the spectral function could also indicate a dimensional crossover @xcite .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the unconventional spectral properties observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials could have a 1d origin .",
    "thus the holons and spinons could play an important role in spectral properties of both 1d and 2d low - dimensional materials .    in this second paper",
    "we continue the studies of the first paper of this series , ref .",
    "@xcite . as a preliminary application of the connection of the concept of rotated electron to the quantum numbers that label the energy eigenstates provided by the bethe - ansatz solution and @xmath0-spin and spin symmetries , in this paper we use exact holon and spinon selection rules for rotated - electron operators in the study of the holon and spinon contents of few - electron excitations .",
    "this reveals the dominant holon and spinon microscopic physical processes that generate more than 99% of the spectral weight of few - electron excitations . while our theory also describes the higher - order processes associated with the remaining less than 1% electronic spectral weight , the clarification of the dominant holon and spinon microscopic mechanisms is valuable for the further understanding and description of the few - electron spectral properties observed in real low - dimensional materials",
    ". fortunately , a preliminary application of the theoretical predictions which follow from our study of the holon and spinon contents of few - electron excitations leads to quantitative agreement with the charge and spin spectral branch lines observed by means of angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) in the organic conductor ttf - tcnq @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite confirm that from the experimental point of view only the spectral weight associated with the dominant holon and spinon microscopic processes is observed .",
    "moreover , in this paper we introduce the concept of an _ effective electronic lattice_. the expression of the electrons in terms of holons , spinons , and pseudoparticles through the electron - rotated - electron transformation studied here for all values of @xmath3 is a first necessary step for the evaluation of finite - energy few - electron spectral function expressions , as further discussed in sec .",
    "v.    in this paper we also discuss and clarify how the relationship of the original electrons to the quantum objects whose occupancy configurations describe the energy eigenstates can be used in a program for evaluation of finite - energy few - electron spectral functions .",
    "the successful fulfilment of such a program needs the concepts of local pseudoparticle and effective pseudoparticle lattice introduced in the third paper of this series , ref .",
    "moreover , in this paper we generalize the concepts of a lower hubbard band and upper hubbard bands to all values of on - site coulombian repulsion .",

    "the transitions associated with the latter deviations are forbidden for the corresponding two - rotated - electron operator .",
    "thus in the case of the two - electron operator the contributions from these transitions are expected to amount for less than 1% of the spectral weight .",

    "<S> in the first paper of this series it was found that the @xmath0-spin @xmath1 holons , spin @xmath1 spinons , and @xmath2 pseudoparticles whose occupancy configurations describe the energy eigenstates of the one - dimensional hubbard model emerge from the electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> an important breakthrough is that the theory provides relevant information about the relationship of the original electrons to these quantum objects . in this second paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss and clarify how such a relation can be used in a program for evaluation of finite - energy few - electron spectral functions . as a first step , here we characterize the dominant holon and spinon microscopic physical processes that originate more than 99% of the few - electron spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> these dominant processes are related to exact selection rules for the values of the number of holons and spinons generated or annihilated by application onto a ground state of rotated - electron operators . </S>",
    "<S> while our theory also describes the higher - order microscopic processes associated with the remaining less than 1% few - electron spectral weight , the clarification and study of the above dominant processes is valuable and useful for the further understanding and description of the few - electron spectral properties observed in real low - dimensional materials . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this paper generalize the concepts of a lower hubbard band and upper hubbard bands to all values of on - site coulombian repulsion . </S>"
