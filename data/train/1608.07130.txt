    "the models presented here favour the scenario that molecular oxygen in 67p / c - g has a primordial origin ( i.e. , formed in the molecular cloud ) and has survived transport through the protostellar envelope and into the comet - forming regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the `` primordial '' origin of is in good agreement with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "however , while @xcite invoked radiolysis to efficiently convert water ice to , we find that the entrapment and strong association with water ice combined with low abundance of species like , , or can alternatively be explained by an efficient formation at the surface of interstellar ices through oxygen atom recombination in relatively warmer ( @xmath179 k ) and denser ( @xmath87 @xmath2 ) conditions than usually expected in dark clouds . the weak correlation of co and with water seen in 67p / c - g is explained by a later formation of these species in dark clouds with respect to and water .",
    "this picture would therefore be consistent with the physical and chemical properties of our solar system , such as the presence of short - lived radio isotopes in meteorites or the orbits of solar system planets , suggesting that our solar system was born in a dense cluster of stars ( see * ? ? ?",
